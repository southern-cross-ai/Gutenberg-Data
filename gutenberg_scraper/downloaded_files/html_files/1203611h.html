  <h2><a id="prol"
     name="prol">PROLOGUE<br>
  <small>A LETTER FROM DR. JABEZ MANTON</small></a></h2>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">My dear Tony</span>,&mdash;I have
  addressed this letter to Dr. Anthony Manton, c/o The Congo Bolobo Mission,
  though if you are anything like your dear father was, before he made money
  and was spoilt for research work, you are probably masquerading as plain Mr.
  Manton, and trusting to luck that your brilliant essays in the <i>Journal of
  Tropical Medicines</i> have escaped the notice of your kind hosts.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I hate telling young men that their work is brilliant,
  because a little praise from a fellow-craftsman has, as a rule, a disastrous
  effect; but family pride, no less than the fact that the opportunities for
  expressing my views are not likely to be many, induce me to pay this tribute
  to your genius. I do not entirely agree with your monograph on the
  Donovan-Leichmann body; that hypothesis seems to be fairly established, but
  you are on the spot and may know better.</p>

  <p class="letter">"It was not to gossip about bugs that I sat down to write
  to you; it is of a more serious matter, because I believe that very soon I
  shall be in that state where either all things will be revealed or every
  sense of understanding will be obliterated.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Picture me, a stoutish and elderly gentleman, red-faced,
  white-haired&mdash;though I swear that my venerable appearance is often ill
  in keeping with the evil passions which rage in my aged breast, ascending the
  stairs of Lady Heron Wendall, the wife of Bulboro's rector. (I have written
  about this lady before; indeed, you know something about the circumstances
  which led to her marriage sixteen years ago&mdash;did not the erring
  Frenchman die most picturesquely in your care? But this is not the time to
  revive scandal.)</p>

  <p class="letter">"I found her in bed, radiating that delicate beauty which a
  certain type of skinny woman has, which in my mind is always associated with
  a process of caducity. I forget now what exactly was the matter with her: I
  believe, when I come to think of it, she wanted to gossip about the latest
  curate's delinquencies. Certain it is that, for very shame's sake, she had to
  discuss the terms of her health. I leant over the bed to take her pulse, and
  then I straightened up, for I heard and felt something inside me which
  interested me as a doctor and saddened me as an individual. Mitral murmurs
  sufficiently distinct to be audible without stethoscopic examination would
  not bother me, indeed, have not bothered me, for I have been suspicious of
  the existence of some aortal thickening for some time.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I went back to my surgery and had a little
  self-examination, and, my dear Tony, nothing which the musical instrument
  makers produce for their Christmas patrons was half as musical as my cardiac
  region.</p>

  <p class="letter">"To make absolutely sure, I went up to town and saw
  Gregorley. He wanted to talk to me about his fans&mdash;he is a 'devil of an
  old woman, you know, outside his job of work, and collects all sorts of
  fripperies and frumperies. But I cut short his talk of Greuze and Watteau and
  made him begin a nice cheap examination. He positively gloated over me, and
  really I had that pleasing sensation which every benefactor, who gives an
  unexpected treat to the poor, must possess, for I recognized that I was an
  exceptional case.</p>

  <p class="letter">"He tells me that I have three weeks to live, and he was
  anxious that I should pack myself in wadding, stretch myself calmly upon
  cee-springs and await dissolution like a gentleman. That, of course, is
  absurd. If I thought that I should go out in an inconvenient manner I should
  do as he suggests, but I have made up my mind to die in the library, which is
  a nice, cosy, cheerful room, and one in which any man, with a taste for books
  and good prints, would elect to die in.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Now, the climax of this letter comes hereunder.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I have the best practice in England in this town, and I am
  most anxious that you shall come along and take it. You've got plenty of
  money&mdash;I am leaving you some twenty-four thousand pounds to add to your
  fortune&mdash;this house is a beautiful old place, dating back to the
  Elizabethan period, and the grounds and garden have been my especial care. I
  want you to take charge of my papers, destroying such as you wish, and
  publishing the others anonymously, for I think I have collected one or two
  facts concerning the Renaissance.</p>

  <p class="letter">"You will get on with my patients if you are rude to them
  systematically, if your attitude is one of brusqueness tempered with
  scepticism. Keep clear of the churches&mdash;this place is a veritable hotbed
  of Christianity&mdash;avoid open partisanship, vote solidly Tory, and you
  will be happy.</p>

  <p class="letter">"You will find Bulboro' as full of microbes as the most
  pestilential of Congo swamps. The microbe which devastates this town most is
  the microbe of intolerance, and a genial hatred of every other person's
  religion is a predominant characteristic of every citizen.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I speak of the churches, because, between them, they make
  up Bulboro's life. Not one of our hundred thousand but has a conviction
  amounting almost to a certainty, that life on the other side of the veil will
  hold something more precious for him than it holds for his neighbour.</p>

  <p class="letter">"You will find Heron Wendall something of a slacker, but
  clever. He is the Rector, tending to the moral and spiritual needs of such as
  do not require salvation so much as encouragement to continue in the faith
  that salvation is superfluous in their cases; they are the old soldiers of
  Christianity, skilled in its goose-steps, in its battalion drills and its
  conventional formations.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Childe is of the rabble, a Baptist, a Saint and a Martyr
  (he was in Bulboro' jail for three weeks for non-payment of rates on the
  education question). Short, another variety of Baptist, is oleaginous, full
  of 'God-bless-you's!' delivered with mechanical fervour. He has a history of
  gastric trouble. I think you will have him on your hands one of these
  days.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Stope is the Congregationalist&mdash;a lean, youngish man
  with a stoop, and declamatory in conversation. An ambitious man, he'll be the
  Liberal candidate at the next election. He is pleasant, sound on questions of
  research ('ware Childe, by the way, who is anti-vivisection, anti-vaccination
  and a vegetarian), but a dangerous man.</p>

  <p class="letter">"The Papist is Carter, austere, tolerant as a Jesuit, a
  gentleman and straight. Regarding you as irretrievably damned in the next
  world, he will do his best to entertain you in this.</p>

  <p class="letter">"The lesser lights I won't bother you with: there's
  Wastrum, who burns incense, crosses himself, and is loathed by the Kensit
  people. He's Oxford and enthusiastic. He has a watch-chain hung with bronze
  medallions, and like Catherine with her charms 'jingles like a mule'. He is
  suspected of having taken a vow of chastity, which has annoyed the rabid
  section of Nonconformity, with their teeming nurseries and overloaded
  bassinets, no end. (Painter does all my maternity work&mdash;you'll like
  him.)</p>

  <p class="letter">"And now, dear lad, I take farewell of you, kissing you in
  the spirit as I kissed you as a dear child. To 'whatever God there is' I
  offer the record of my life for audit. I shall await you on the other side of
  the curtain, full of eagerness and curiosity. By the way, look after that
  grey filly of mine, she is by Grey Leg out of a Galopin mare. She is up to
  thirteen stone, and is a rare leaper. Later I should send her to stud; you
  might get a good foal, who knows?</p>

  <p class="letter">"<i>Am Tag</i>! as the German officers said.</p>

  <p class="letter">&mdash;Your uncle and friend,</p>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Jabez Manton</span>."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1">I. &mdash; TONY COMES HOME</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The guide-books say that Bulboro' lies on the Avel, but you
  must leave Bulboro' behind to find that pleasant stream.</p>

  <p>It is true there is a large and sluggish basin where grimy barges lie, but
  the water is soulless and dead and streaked with the gloomy iridescence which
  speaks eloquently of oil drums carelessly handled.</p>

  <p>The banks are stark and rubbled, or overlaid with staging on which the
  clumsy cranes puff up and down, slowly and asthmatically.</p>

  <p>There is, too, in the lower town, a short iron bridge, depressing in its
  ugliness, which spans a dark stream and is known as Avel Bridge, though, as a
  matter of absolute fact, no Avel, but a half-hearted canal, flows
  beneath.</p>

  <p>You must travel outside Bulboro' for a glimpse of the stream as the poets
  know it and the painters have shown it. Away from the tall chimneys of the
  glass works, and the woollen mills, and the overpowering obesity of the
  Bulboro' Gas Light and Fuel Company's monstrous gasometers; away from the
  clang and the jangle of the electric cars, the melancholy drone of
  innumerable sirens, and the everlasting rattle of Siggses Iron Works, you
  will find the river flowing in its serene and natural beauty.</p>

  <p>Bulboro' is a discoloration at the bottom of a great saucer. All the dregs
  of the Avel valley have drained into the town. Outside there is a beautiful
  land of soft breezes, of yellow cornfields (in the proper season), of ancient
  farm-houses, thatched and decrepit old cottages, masked by clematis and
  approached by the narrowest of paths, through flowers waist high, so narrow
  because the cottages could spare no more space for the foot of man. There are
  inns for the seeking, inns with low-roofed parlours and spacious fire-places.
  Summer or winter, the Avel valley is a joy to the stifled folk of Bulboro'.
  Mist stealing over the hills and entangled like thinnest gossamer, means
  dense yellow fog in the town. Sunlight and shadow on the waving cornfields of
  the valley thicken to something which is neither sunlight nor shadow in the
  hot streets of Bulboro'. Snow in billows of virgin white is black slush in
  the city.</p>

  <p>But Bulboro' is by far too busy to devote overmuch attention to such
  matters as the aesthetic aspect of meteorology. In Bulboro' it is "hot" or it
  is "cold", or it is adjectived hot or adjectived cold&mdash;and only the
  adjective employed varies.</p>

  <p>It was cold when Anthony Manton came out of the station buildings
  overcoated to the chin. The porter informed him that it was cold. The
  fly-driver paused in the operation of stacking his luggage to tell him as
  much, the little newsboy at the stall had handed him a paper and his change,
  with the respectful intimation that it was "very cold".</p>

  <p>It was cold enough for this young man, with the brown, lean face. He
  shivered a little as an icy gust came swirling through the open door of the
  booking office, and he pulled up the collar of his coat. He was tall and
  strongly built. He carried himself with the freedom of a sailor and had the
  sailor's blue far-seeing eyes.</p>

  <p>He was clean-shaven, save for a closely cropped moustache. His nose and
  the straight black eyebrows gave his features a T-square regularity. His chin
  was firm, and he was saved from nondescript handsomeness by a certain
  hollowness of cheek and an expression of severity which comes to the man who
  does not readily smile. Yet you might judge him to be capable of enormous
  laughter. There were possibilities of merriment in his solemn eyes and the
  uneven line of his lips.</p>

  <p>Every man's face has a message; a message which speaks with a great
  eloquence to the people who are wise in the reading of faces. Anthony Manton
  said some things plainly, offered grounds for speculation in others. He was
  the observer, keen, eager, patient. There was indifference amounting almost
  to contempt in the lips, inflexibility in the set of his jaw, concentration
  in the perpendicular lines of his forehead, shrewd sure reasoning power in
  the lift of his eyelids.</p>

  <p>He might have found difficulty in offering an explanation for the more
  elusive qualities of his face. For the moment, at any rate, he was in no mood
  for self-analysis, for he agreed with the porter, the newsboy, and most
  emphatically with the fly-driver, that it was cold.</p>

  <p>His companion, muffled up to the eyes, his neck thickly encircled with a
  great woollen muffler, said nothing. His brown eyes stared impassively from
  under his scarlet tarbosh at a peculiarly unattractive corner of an
  unpleasant land. His big brown hands were thrust into the depths of an
  enormous ulster and his feet were protected by two pairs of woollen stockings
  encased in large and strange boots.</p>

  <p>"Ho, Ahmet!" said Anthony Manton, turning gravely to the other and
  speaking in the bastard Arabic of the Coast, "this is a world without
  comfort."</p>

  <p>Ahmet unthawed his voice huskily.</p>

  <p>"God protect us," he said, "for my marrow is frozen, and there is a pain
  in my ears as though all the tsetses in the world were drawing blood. Now I
  think this place is hell and I am being punished for my sins, lord. For never
  in my life have I been so sorrowful."</p>

  <p>Anthony's lips twitched.</p>

  <p>"Get into this carriage," he said in the same language. "Afterwards we
  shall come to a place more pleasant, and you shall make me coffee of great
  heat and comfort."</p>

  <p>He closed the carriage door on his servant and looked round to say
  good-bye to his travelling companion.</p>

  <p>He picked him out from a tangle of passengers, for it was two days before
  Christmas and there were many who called Bulboro' "home" without shame.</p>

  <p>Anthony walked swiftly to where the little man stood.</p>

  <p>He was obviously Hebraic. The broad face, the heavy lids, the closely
  cropped beard were typical. He was not handsome, yet his brown eyes twinkled
  with good humour; his smile was quick to come, and you saw that life to him
  held none of the tragedy which is so unmistakably reflected on the Jew's
  face. The world was a "funny place" to Ambrose Cohen. That was his favourite
  verdict.</p>

  <p>He was well dressed in a long, fur-lined coat, that reached to his heels;
  his hat a grey bowler, his cigar large and fragrant. The coat concealed most
  of his raiment, and you might suspect hidden brilliance of stone and precious
  metal to testify his wealth; but Ambrose Cohen was in many ways an
  extraordinary man. For the display which appealed to his compatriots he had
  no desire, though he was a very rich man, a magnate, even by Johannesburg
  standards.</p>

  <p>Sentiment brought him to Bulboro', for in this tiny town he had first seen
  the day. His father, a working jeweller, was long since dead. Cohen lived in
  a beautiful house in West Hill, with a handsome wife and two little children
  whom he adored. The country attracted him because he was a keen horseman,
  rode regularly to hounds, and had so far overcome the prejudice of a
  conservative county, as to be one of the most popular members of the
  Hunt.</p>

  <p>He saw Manton and came impetuously forward, offering his gloved hand.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," he said, his eyes dancing with good humour, "you will see me
  again."</p>

  <p>"I hope not professionally," said Anthony.</p>

  <p>The other laughed.</p>

  <p>"I have no fear," he said. "I am so well that even a doctor could not
  injure me. Take my advice to heart"&mdash;he shook his gloved finger at the
  other jokingly&mdash;"if they want to know your religion say you're a Jew,
  otherwise they will fight for your body."</p>

  <p>He spoke with a little lisp which was pleasant to hear. He could not sound
  his "r's" distinctly, probably a habit acquired from a boyhood spent at
  Newcastle, where his uncle had controlled a coastwise line.</p>

  <p>"I shall remember," said Anthony, the ghost of a smile playing at the
  corner of his lips. He opened the fly door and stepped in, returning the
  farewell wave of the other as the fly clattered down the steep incline into
  the street.</p>

  <p>Ahmet sat facing him, taking a more cheerful view of things and a faint
  interest in the neighbourhood. They drove over the well-paved streets;
  clanging tramcars passed and re-passed them; the thoroughfare was almost
  crowded from the standpoint of one who had lived in a country where white men
  are to be met at the rate of six a year.</p>

  <p>They skirted the lower town, row after row of stone-coloured villas,
  through the even more crowded market street where the wives of Bulboro' came
  to prepare a feast for their lords. Then the jog-trot of the fly slowed down
  to a walk as it began the steady climb of West Hill. Gradually they shook off
  the shops and entered a region of small detached houses which improved in
  quality as they mounted. The road twisted and turned so that in one place
  there was an undisturbed view of the smoke-dimmed panorama of Bulboro'
  below.</p>

  <p>"What think you of this place, Ahmet?" asked Anthony. The Arab turned a
  long and dispassionate view on the scene at his feet.</p>

  <p>"There are many good people," he said; "for I see the towers of their
  mosques wherever I look. This must be a holy place."</p>

  <p>Anthony nodded.</p>

  <p>They came at last to "Pilgrim's Rest"; nobody knew who had named it so;
  certainly the doctor had taken it with its nomenclature established and had
  made no violent attempt to unfold the mystery of its name.</p>

  <p>It was a small rambling house. Anthony remembered that he had likened it
  to a dog trying to chase its tail, and growing discouraged at the place where
  the stables stretched an archway across to the hot-houses. It was an
  inconsequent house, without any particular reason why any of it should have
  been built as it was. It represented in Anthony Manton's mind tangible
  evidence that it had come down through the hands of a dozen generations
  temperamentally opposed, each a little contemptuous of its predecessor and
  desirous, in its own erratic way, of covering one fault of architecture with
  a fault more glaring.</p>

  <p>Time had softened the blunders of its dead builders, nature had thrown
  over it a veil of ivy here, had hung a frieze of climbing roses there, had
  tempered this angle with an oak; that gap with a riot of flowering plants.
  Nature may have been assisted, and probably was; but Anthony Manton, in his
  imaginative youth, had pictured a. friendly but invisible familiar who had
  his habitation in a disused tool-shed at the end of the garden, and who
  employed himself in correcting the errors which the brick men and stone men
  of all ages had accumulated.</p>

  <p>The old servants were waiting to receive him, and with a nod left and
  right he went straight to the library, where a cheerful fire burned.</p>

  <p>There he stood in the doorway, silent and thoughtful. Jocks, his uncle's
  butler, was behind him. There was no need to ask any questions: he knew from
  the letter which had reached him at Teneriffe that in that old cosy chair to
  the right of the fire-place honest and kindly Jabez Manton had passed beyond
  the veil.</p>

  <p>He had no qualms in seating himself in the chair. He was too much of a
  doctor to worry overmuch about the sentimental aspect of his return, too much
  of a man also, to pass without thought the significance of that empty chair.
  He sat for a while thinking. Jocks came with a cup of coffee.</p>

  <p>"The foreign person made it, sir," he said punctiliously. "He had some
  difficulty in conveying his wants, but fortunately poor Dr.
  Manton&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jocks," interrupted the young man quietly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Do not refer to my uncle as 'poor Dr. Manton'&mdash;it does not please
  me."</p>

  <p>The butler stiffened.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, sir," he said; "it is only natural, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>"It isn't natural at all," said Anthony, "it's sentimental. You can love a
  man without feeling sorry for him&mdash;you don't feel sorry for Shakespeare,
  or for Lord Nelson, do you? However, go on with what you were saying."</p>

  <p>"The doctor," said the ruffled servant, "had the apparatus which the
  native required&mdash;he does not speak English?</p>

  <p>"No," said Anthony.</p>

  <p>"That's a great pity," said Jocks.</p>

  <p>It was as great a pity that Jocks had not a working knowledge of Arabic,
  but this opinion Anthony did not express.</p>

  <p>At his request the servants brought in two of his trunks, which were
  filled with papers, memoranda, and such books as he immediately required. He
  spent a busy two hours settling himself in his new surroundings. There had
  been no other message for him other than the one he had received. Dr.
  Manton's passing had been peaceable and painless: he had complained of
  faintness, and Jocks had gone to bring him a glass of water. When he
  returned, the old doctor was dead.</p>

  <p>Bulboro' had afforded him the magnificent funeral which the town felt was
  due to its dignity no less than to its sense of gratitude for favours past.
  For once the churches had combined with the friendly societies in the
  formation of a choice spectacle; and since the doctor had been something of a
  nonsectarian and had judiciously hidden his particular leaning in religious
  matters from the curious gaze of Bulboro's elect, and no wish had been
  expressed in his will as to the method of his burial, all the churches of
  Bulboro' had met at the graveside.</p>

  <p>Anthony had learnt this from a very correctly written letter which had
  been dispatched to him <i>en route</i> by Jocks.</p>

  <p>The entry of the young doctor into the life of the town was as undramatic
  as it could possibly be. At eight o'clock that night he walked into the
  consulting-room of the free dispensary established by his uncle, brusquely
  replied to the little address of welcome which the committee had thought it
  necessary to prepare, and devoted the evening to an examination of the
  applicants. His experience as a general practitioner had been practically
  nil, but he had doctored native people, and between the native mind and the
  mind of the civilized poor there is very little difference. They were equally
  garrulous, equally charged with an eager desire to describe their symptoms.
  Anthony Manton had a brief, sharp way with him and was disinclined to allow
  his new patients to follow the example of the committee.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure we're all very glad to see you, Dr. Manton," said a pale-faced
  woman rocking a baby jerkily. "I'm sure, dear Dr. Manton&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is it the baby or you?" asked Anthony.</p>

  <p>"It's the child, sir," said the woman. "I have had a lot of trouble with
  him. I was saying to my sister"</p>

  <p>"Let me look at him"</p>

  <p>He cut short the personal reminiscence, so dear to the heart of the
  hypochondriac, with a sharp, almost brutal, diagnosis, sometimes to their
  discredit.</p>

  <p>He had nearly finished when Dr. Painter, of whom his uncle had written,
  came in. He was a middle-aged florid man with an irregular beard and an
  abstracted manner. It had driven many an expectant father to the verge of
  madness, for, argued the distraught parent-to-be, what other reason for
  abstraction could there be than that "something had gone wrong?"</p>

  <p>Anthony gave him a cheery welcome. He had a tremendous sympathy with his
  brother medicals, and the reserve which marked his intercourse with his
  fellows dropped away from him in their presence, and you saw something of the
  real man underneath.</p>

  <p>They exchanged a few words about the dispensary.</p>

  <p>"They're an ungrateful lot of devils," said Painter; "your uncle went to a
  great deal of expense and bother to get this dispensary fixed up, and
  naturally they think that he made a fortune out of it."</p>

  <p>"That's the way of the poor, they never really understand charity in its
  best sense," said Anthony. "They cannot understand the spirit of
  sacrifice."</p>

  <p>He left the dispensary with Dr. Painter, and they drove together back to
  the house.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">II. &mdash; A LEADER AND SECRETARY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A raw, grey day had grown to a night of cold rain and sleet.
  Somewhere, where the air was purer, where great grey angry seas beat upon the
  rocky headlands, a sou'-westerly gale scalloped the bosom of the ocean and
  slashed the tops of the waves into a wild fan of steaming spray.</p>

  <p>Here in Bulboro' only whimpering echoes of the storm came in spasms. It
  was lost and baffled in the narrow streets, under high walls of factory and
  mill, in the culs-de-sac where it fought in little mad circles for escape,
  rattling the frail windows of cottaged workers, blowing open incautiously
  unfastened doors, extinguishing oil lamps and slamming interior doors with
  thunderous noise.</p>

  <p>In the High Street it came swirling round corners, driving the drenching
  rain before it; yet High Street was tolerably full, and the tramcars were
  loaded.</p>

  <p>Wednesday night was always a little crowded in Bulboro'. There was service
  or an evening of mild amusement at St. Peter's; the chapels had services
  also, and earlier in the evening three Band of Hope meetings were held in
  various parts of the city.</p>

  <p>This Band of Hope question was a serious one. Attendance and membership
  were on the decrease, and there were open accusations of proselytizing made
  by two of the sects which controlled the children's organizations.</p>

  <p>Pastor Childe had permitted himself the luxury of a righteous rage, and
  this publicly, when he charged "the secret servants of the Scarlet Woman"
  with enticing the youth of Bulboro' to "the image-worshipping orgies of
  furtive papistry".</p>

  <p>The Church complained in more sober and less direct language of the
  "unfortunate influences" which were being brought to bear upon the children,
  but named no names, for the attitude of the Church was that peculiar to a
  long-established newspaper in its dealings with obscure and impotent
  contemporaries&mdash;it ignored frankly, and reproved so sweepingly as to
  bring into the net of its reprobation not alone the object of its
  displeasure, but every other which could by every stretch of the imagination
  be regarded as remotely antagonistic.</p>

  <p>The Wesleyans blamed nobody save their ministers, which is a way Wesleyans
  have.</p>

  <p>The Congregationalists were not particularly affected, because the
  energies of the Church were directed elsewhere. Their members were far too
  occupied by the question of Land Proprietorship, which was to free the
  country from the curse of poverty, sin, drunkenness, and the encyclopaedia
  tale of misery which comes&mdash;so the propagandists say&mdash;in the trail
  of land poverty. Moreover, to the consternation of the leading
  Congregationalists, the Church had almost suspended its evangelistic work,
  and the political spirit had so invaded the pulpit as to make Sunday morning
  and evening two periods which the earnest politician of Bulboro' looked
  forward to with something akin to joyous anticipation. Before the church were
  notice-boards which gave a hint of the character of the forthcoming
  services.</p>

  <p>In the morning the Rev. Hartburn Gray (of Woolwich) would deliver an
  "address" on "If Peter were a member of the House of Lords," and in the
  evening the Rev. Valentine Stope would discuss "The Devil and the Whigs."</p>

  <p>Little time had the good Congregationalists for such futilities as the
  Band of Hope. The "Men's Hour" on Sunday afternoon had almost destroyed the
  Sunday schools, which had dropped in point of attendance from one hundred to
  seventy during the ministry of the fiery young Radical.</p>

  <p>Yet it was due neither to the proselytizing of Baptist, nor to the
  allurement of ritual, nor yet, it must be confessed, to the enlarging of
  Congregationalist political activities, that the growth of juvenile apathy
  might be traced. A new decade had witnessed the arrival of cinema palaces,
  had seen great white structures, for all the world like exaggerated
  wedding-cakes, grow out of old and unlettable shops.</p>

  <p>A new interest had come into the lives of Bulboro's young citizens; a new
  world opened before their eyes. Drama there was of a healthy
  kind&mdash;drama, with revolvers and cowboys galloping in dusty bunches and
  mannish girls riding astride. But there were serious instructive pictures.
  Object lessons more delectable than science masters could demonstrate, with
  the veritable cities of the empire before your eyes and their strangely clad,
  scowling citizens. There was history filmed by a French house, with gallants
  in hose and doublet, historical happenings breathlessly portrayed.</p>

  <p>There you followed Napoleon from triumph to triumph, grew sad over the
  fate of a tangible Christopher Columbus, watched Cortés at his work, lived
  with Leonardo da Vinci, supped with the Most Christian kings of France. The
  pictures were insidiously harmless.</p>

  <p>The two theatres, the Grand and the Royal, had never drawn the youth of
  Bulboro' from its pleasant devotions. The antagonism between Nonconformity
  and the theatre was rather a matter of hereditary enmity than the growth of
  modern sentiment. Little Nonconformists were born with the inbred knowledge
  that the theatre was an evil thing, and the first breakaway from a rigid
  observance of the pure life was usually associated with a defiant son or an
  incoherent daughter "owning up" to the possession of theatre tickets.</p>

  <p>But the cinema craze had grown with such rapidity that parents had had no
  time to formulate their views and ministers had given no lead in the
  matter.</p>

  <p>Cinema exhibitions had come originally in the guise of entertainments in
  church and chapel "halls", and since churchwardens and circuit stewards had
  offered no objection to this type of entertainment in its original shape,
  they were somewhat embarrassed by its growth and popularity.</p>

  <p>Anthony came through the chill and drizzle of the High Street buttoned up
  to his neck. He had been called to a case of influenza, and, to the scandal
  and indignation of the patient's parents, had diagnosed the case as one of
  scarlet fever.</p>

  <p>"Scarlet fever, doctor?" said the stout lady of the house incredulously.
  "I have been a mother now for twenty years, and if I don't know scarlet fever
  when I see it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You may be a mother, madam, for two hundred years," said Anthony in his
  dry way, "and still fail to qualify at the College of Physicians."</p>

  <p>"I'll have to see another doctor," said the father.</p>

  <p>He had been a silent but resentful listener, in accordance with the
  practice and tradition of a class in which the women have the monopoly of all
  private conferences with the family doctor.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Anthony. "I think you would be wise to do so if you have
  any doubt on the matter in the meantime, I must notify the case."</p>

  <p>"Are you entitled to do that?" asked the man.</p>

  <p>He was, Anthony learnt, a well-known figure of Bulboro' society, being one
  of the lay preachers and orators of the Congregational Church.</p>

  <p>"I am not only entitled, I am compelled," said Anthony patiently.</p>

  <p>The man saw him to the door.</p>

  <p>"Your uncle," he said bitterly, "was known as the poor man's
  doctor&mdash;he didn't go notifying diseases."</p>

  <p>"Please don't talk rubbish," said the young doctor, and thereby struck
  from his register one of the old doctor's trying cases.</p>

  <p>No, thought Anthony, as he made his way back through the thronged street
  and across the wind-swept little oval which marked the centre of the town and
  for some reason bore the name of "The Chad", there was little difference
  between the aboriginal of the cannibal forests and the aboriginal mind of
  Bulboro'. He stopped outside the theatre to read the bills and examine the
  photographs.</p>

  <p>As he did so a girl came hurriedly through the vestibule, followed by a
  boy of fourteen.</p>

  <p>The girl's face arrested him.</p>

  <p>It was singularly pretty&mdash;that prettiness which is made up of black
  and white&mdash;glowing black of eye, dead black of arched eyebrow and
  lustrous black of hair. Her face was of that peculiar pallor which betrays
  city dwellers. But here there was no unhealthy patchiness in the white, and
  the lips were rose-red.</p>

  <p>She hesitated fearfully in the vestibule and looked out into the street
  and back at the boy.</p>

  <p>She was so close to the doctor that he took a step back, thinking that she
  wished to pass him.</p>

  <p>She came down one step and as swiftly went back with a startled "Oh!"</p>

  <p>Then she turned back and fled the way she had come, leaving the boy,
  bewildered and uninformed as to the cause of her panic.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Manton."</p>

  <p>Anthony swung round.</p>

  <p>Tanberry, the parent of the scarlet fever patient, was standing behind
  him, an angry frown on his face. But the frown was not directed towards the
  doctor&mdash;it went past him and smote the abashed boy who still stood at
  the entrance of the theatre vestibule.</p>

  <p>"James Gill," said Tanberry sternly, "what are you doing in this devil's
  house?"</p>

  <p>The boy opened his mouth to speak, but no word came; he was hypnotized by
  the awful knowledge of his sin, by the terror of detection.</p>

  <p>"Does your father know that you are here?" asked Tanberry.</p>

  <p>The boy muttered something which the other took to be a negative.</p>

  <p>"Who has enticed you here&mdash;are you alone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the boy doggedly.</p>

  <p>Anthony created a diversion.</p>

  <p>"Did you want to speak to me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the man shortly, "but my heart is heavy with sorrow to see
  this"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I cannot share your condemnation with the boy," said Anthony,
  with a little smile. "I'm rather in a hurry, though you may not think
  so."</p>

  <p>The man turned his attention from the boy, and out of sheer pity Anthony
  Manton led the other on past the theatre to give the boy (it was the girl he
  was thinking of) a chance to escape.</p>

  <p>"I want to ask you, doctor," said the man hesitatingly, "if this is
  scarlet fever, is there any danger&mdash;to me?"</p>

  <p>"If you have touched the child&mdash;yes," said the doctor; "not a great
  danger, but still a danger. You can never be sure with infectious
  diseases."</p>

  <p>Tanberry looked unhappy, stroking his short red beard.</p>

  <p>"It would be a great misfortune if I contracted scarlet fever," he said.
  "You probably know, doctor, that I, under God and by His divine mercy
  "&mdash;he looked up at the sky swiftly&mdash;"am a leader of our little
  Rescue League and the secretary of the Brotherhood&mdash;in fact, it would be
  disastrous if I were removed from the sphere in wh&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It would also be disastrous if your wife were similarly removed," said
  Anthony brusquely; "or your children or any of your neighbours. I don't
  suppose you're two inches bigger in the eyes of God than anybody else. You've
  got to take your chance."</p>

  <p>"If I went away, do you think?" suggested the other, too anxious to resent
  the offensive tone of the doctor. "I have a brother in London who'd be glad
  to put me up for a week or so."</p>

  <p>Anthony's lip curled.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that would be fatal&mdash;to your work," he said softly.
  "Stay here, my friend, and labour in the vineyard, for as the good book says:
  'He who fights and runs away, never lives to say hooray!'"</p>

  <p>He left Mr. Tanberry staring after him,</p>

  <p>"An atheist," said Tanberry at last, turning towards his stricken home.
  "Soften his heart, O Lord, and let him see the Light. Give him under Thy
  guidance, Grace and Faith." And he went on his way to call in another doctor,
  for he was by no means satisfied that Dr. Anthony Manton knew his
  business.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3">III. &mdash; THE RECTOR AND HIS WIFE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Dr. Manton's arrival in Bulboro' was announced with
  prominence in the current issue of the <i>Bulboro' Herald</i>. It was one of
  those suggestive events which the town might reasonably regard as being of
  first consequence.</p>

  <p>Anthony bore a name which was honoured from one end of the county to
  another, and whether it was in the Club, on "The Chad", or in the congested
  little streets which run northwest from the Crescent, it was one of the items
  of public news which called for repetition.</p>

  <p>It is proper that the views of Bulboro' should be taken in order of social
  precedence.</p>

  <p>The Hon. and Rev. Heron Wendall had a mansion (it would be absurd to
  describe it as anything less) half-way up West Hill in the shadow of St.
  Joseph's. St. Joseph's was Bulboro's one Catholic church, and that the shadow
  of its square towers should fall across the well-kept lawn of the Church
  House did not greatly disturb the Rector. Like many another man, he was
  tolerant where his inclinations ran.</p>

  <p>He was not tolerant of the Dissenters, and had St. Joseph's been the
  flamboyant structure of the Congregationalists, its presence might very well
  have irritated him to a point beyond human endurance, but St. Joseph's was a
  different matter.</p>

  <p>He had considerable respect for the old Church; would even go so far as to
  admit, if his audience was sufficiently intimate to hear and discreet enough
  to retain the views he expressed&mdash;that it was, perhaps, a pity that
  Henry VIII had ever lived, or that there should have arisen any difference
  between Rome and the Court of St. James.</p>

  <p>On a morning a few days after the arrival of Anthony Manton, Lady Beatrice
  Heron Wendall had invited her nominal lord to breakfast with her in her
  little den. It was an invitation which she did not often extend, and the Hon.
  and Rev. Heron Wendall had received it with inward quaking.</p>

  <p>He was a tall sleek man, rather bald, and inclined to breadth. His face
  suggested an aesthetic run to fat. There was culture and intellect in the
  forehead and in the eyes, and a certain refinement in the thin nose. But the
  mouth was a little too full, and the chin a thought too plump to please your
  carping physiognomist.</p>

  <p>He had a ready smile: a smile which was even and lit up the whole of his
  face and would deceive the unknowing into complete confidence in its
  spontaneity.</p>

  <p>But those who knew the reverend gentleman, and were sufficiently
  interested to study all his characteristics, knew exactly which line would
  crease first, knew how the smile dawned at the edge of the lips, and how the
  wrinkling eyes immediately followed, might tell you, indeed, the width of
  every wrinkle, and the duration of every little pucker that went to make the
  Rector's geniality.</p>

  <p>His voice was rich and sonorous, his hands white and perfectly manicured,
  his dress invariably irreproachable. He was a model of all that a Rector
  should be, and might with profit have been sealed by the Ecclesiastical
  Commissioners as a pattern of habiliment, manner and deportment for all
  clergymen of the Church of England for all time.</p>

  <p>The youngest son of Lord Pershore, he came to Bulboro' with the cachet of
  his aristocratic lineage, and Bulboro' received him with open arms as some
  slight token of the Bishop's regard.</p>

  <p>There were hypercritical people, who complained that the honourable and
  reverend gentleman was lacking in sympathy, wanting something in humanity,
  and that he was wooden, heartless and cold. But there are in all probability
  members of the Church who are everlastingly elbowing in the direction of
  evangelism; people who are not satisfied with the urgent business of their
  own and their families' salvation, but must needs go raking about in
  unsavoury rag-bags for most undesirable sinners.</p>

  <p>There were others who said he was shallow and insincere. Pierce the
  suavity and the veneer of him, you came upon a cotton-wool filling of
  stupidity.</p>

  <p>Possibly the Hon. and Rev. Heron Wendall heard of these criticisms, but he
  could afford to ignore them.</p>

  <p>He belonged to a class which for generations had chosen not only their own
  friends but their own enemies.</p>

  <p>Outside the circle they had thus drawn, they accepted neither compliment
  nor rebuke.</p>

  <p>A dissatisfied schismatic might cede from the Church and go over to the
  Wesleyans to the scandal of church-going Bulboro'. He might even arise in a
  public place and denounce the rulers of the Church in its relation to the
  poor, and find himself applauded by a large congregation of another sect, who
  had troubles of their own but were not averse to receiving recruits to fill
  the gap which their own schismatics had left.</p>

  <p>But the Rev. Heron Wendall went on his way impassive and unmoved, smiled
  his quick smile, and murmured "how interesting" when the news of such a
  meeting was brought to him. Thereafter he would dismiss the matter from his
  mind as being unworthy to discuss even in the privacy of <i>tête-à-tête</i>
  luncheon with his lady wife. But did General Sir Burton Brown, aged and
  irascible, on the verge of senility moreover, offer criticism of a service,
  or present his compliments in his weak old caligraphy, drawing attention to
  the unseemliness of the choir-boys' behaviour or the intonation of the
  curate, then the Hon. and Rev. Heron Wendall sat in his study in judgment,
  with choirboys and curates, and choir-masters and organist arraigned before
  him, and the inquisition might take the greater part of a day and spoil his
  rest at night.</p>

  <p>Of all the critics he had chosen, there was none so potent a factor in his
  life, and of whose judgment he stood more in awe, than that noble lady whose
  alliance with his fortune had marked a distinct advancement in his worldly
  career.</p>

  <p>"Tell your lady," he said to the trim maid who brought the message, "that
  I shall have pleasure in breakfasting with her."</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"At what time?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"At eleven o'clock, sir," said the maid.</p>

  <p>He nodded, and the girl went back with his message.</p>

  <p>What did she want? he wondered. He was not usually favoured with such
  invitations.</p>

  <p>Lady Heron Wendall was a convenient invalid who exercised all the
  privileges and experienced none of the discomforts of sickness. She was the
  autocrat of the Rectory; dominated not only the limited society of the town,
  but all that was most exclusive in the county. Most effectively did she
  dominate the Hon. and Rev. Heron Wendall.</p>

  <p>As he sat at his desk preparing his next Sunday's sermon, he turned over
  in his mind every possible explanation for the summons, but without securing
  any great satisfaction, and at three minutes to eleven he tapped at the door
  of his wife's room.</p>

  <p>Beatrice Heron Wendall was still a beautiful woman. Her pallor gave her an
  appearance of frailty which was unjustified, for in a sense she was a hearty
  woman. Her Titian red hair, her delicately pencilled eyebrows, and her long,
  black lashes may possibly have owed something to artificial aid. As to this,
  the hairdresser who came weekly from London to "do her up"&mdash;the
  expression was her maid's&mdash;might have supplied information which
  feminine Bulboro' already guessed.</p>

  <p>She half lay, half sat, upon a settee drawn up to the window overlooking
  the lawn and affording a glimpse of Bulboro', half-hidden in the smoky hollow
  below. She nodded "Good morning" to her husband as he entered.</p>

  <p>A chair had been placed for him, but he crossed to her, and bending over
  her, kissed her on the forehead.</p>

  <p>"And how did you sleep last night, Beatrice?" he asked pleasantly. His
  smile lasted a little longer for her.</p>

  <p>"I slept all right," she said carelessly. "Sit down, will you! Do not
  wander about the room, Edward, you fidget me."</p>

  <p>He smiled again, pulled up his chair to the little table, and handled an
  egg rather daintily. He had had his breakfast two hours before, and was never
  less inclined to a meal than he was at that moment.</p>

  <p>"I want you to call on this new Manton man," she said, looking out of the
  window.</p>

  <p>"Which new Manton man, my love?" smiled the Rector. "There is only one
  Manton man I should think of mentioning," she replied, turning on him the
  cold and disapproving stare of her blue eyes, "the old doctor's nephew; he
  arrived in Bulboro' the other night. I want him to call upon me."</p>

  <p>"My dear," protested the other in terms of genial reproach, "of course he
  will call upon you."</p>

  <p>"If there was any of course about it," she said impatiently, "I should not
  bother you, but I knew old Manton very well, much better than you."</p>

  <p>She might have added that he knew her very well, much better than her
  husband had ever known her, and that he had probed her character and found
  the dark places of her life which had remained hidden from the man she had
  married.</p>

  <p>"This Anthony man is a scientist, and the real scientist is never
  impressed by local big-wigs. You have to see him and make him come here."</p>

  <p>"Why not send for him in the ordinary way, my dear," suggested the Rector,
  "the next time you feel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do not talk like a fool, Edward," said Lady Heron Wendall calmly. "If I
  call him in he will confine himself to symptoms, and I do not feel inclined
  to discuss my digestive organs with a perfect stranger."</p>

  <p>"To-day?" Her husband pursed his lips in thought.</p>

  <p>"To-day," said Lady Heron Wendall; "I want to see him particularly."</p>

  <p>The Rector bowed.</p>

  <p>"Of course, if you want him I will see that he comes," he said easily.</p>

  <p>He had no doubt in his mind as to the alacrity with which such an
  invitation would be accepted. An invitation from the Rectory was tantamount
  to a royal command.</p>

  <p>She must have read what was passing in his mind, for suddenly she
  said:</p>

  <p>"Please don't harbour any stupid ideas about this young man desiring to
  come. I had a letter from Bexley to-day. He says it is the talk of London
  that a man of Anthony Manton's abilities should bury himself in a hole like
  Bulboro'."</p>

  <p>Edward Heron Wendall demurred.</p>

  <p>"I would not call Bulboro' a hole," he said. "To my mind the town is
  rather a microcosm of England. We have all the same conditions, the same
  opportunities, the same scope"</p>

  <p>She arrested his eloquence with a weary lift of her hand. "For God's sake,
  do not preach at me, Edward," she said. "I have heard all this so often."</p>

  <p>"My dear," he protested mildly.</p>

  <p>At that moment the door opened without any ceremony, and a girl came into
  the room. She was tall and straight, and exquisitely gowned. But it was her
  face which arrested those who beheld her for the first time. You might search
  all England for a face as beautiful as hers. Hair, eyes, colouring, all
  contributed to her loveliness. Geraldine Brand at nineteen was the most
  beautiful woman in England. Whenever society functions offered eager editors
  an excuse, her face looked down from the bookstalls from Aberdeen to
  Truro.</p>

  <p>Though she was only nineteen at the time, she had received, possibly, more
  offers of marriage than has been the lot of any girl of her class. Often the
  stories concerning her were a little exaggerated. There was not in the whole
  of Burke a sufficiently large number of unmarried dukes to justify all the
  stories which were told, but that she might have been the Countess of
  Winboro' or Lady Pierce de Vernon admits of no doubt.</p>

  <p>She was the spoilt child of a fond and, be it confessed, unscrupulous
  father.</p>

  <p>Sir John Brand had a reputation which extended beyond the confines of his
  country; he was a notorious <i>bon viveur</i>, a good fellow to people who
  confound virtue with exuberance, a generous and a lax father.</p>

  <p>No less than an indulgent parent had susceptible, eligible England
  contributed to her spoiling. There were people who found Geraldine Brand
  unbearable, but in justice to the girl, it may be said that they were mainly
  feminine.</p>

  <p>The arrogance of youth is particularly trying, but to none is it more a
  source of irritation than to the parents and guardians, to the brothers and
  lovers, of other youth.</p>

  <p>She came with a run across the room.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Edward." she called gaily in her high, sweet voice, and
  leaning over the couch where Lady Beatrice lay, she gave her a hug. The elder
  woman returned the caress warmly. She was very fond of the girl, and perhaps
  she saw in her something of her own youth and was jealous for her to secure
  the opportunities which had been denied to herself.</p>

  <p>"Well, Jerry, where have you been?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have been down to High Street," said the girl, seating herself
  perilously on one end of the settee. "I went to 'The Chad', a grisly hole,
  Edward."</p>

  <p>Edward Heron Wendall was her first cousin, and she exercised a cousin's
  privilege, often to his embarrassment, for there was a disparity in their
  ages which seemed to call for more respect and deference than she felt called
  upon to extend to him.</p>

  <p>"I wonder why they allow St. Peter's to stand right in the middle of that
  very valuable place?" she asked. "The old Chad itself looks jolly, but there
  is nothing beautiful or lovely or jolly about St. Peter's." She shook her
  head ruefully. "It is the most abominable building that has ever been erected
  in Bulboro'."</p>

  <p>"Now, now," said her cousin with solemn humour, "you must not say that
  kind of thing, Jerry; remember that the church was erected to commemorate a
  most solemn&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The girl snapped her fingers</p>

  <p>"I know all about it, it was one of those awful Jubilee things which were
  put up all over England."</p>

  <p>"Why did you go to the Chad?" asked Lady Wendall curiously. "It is rather
  early, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>The girl hesitated, then smiled</p>

  <p>"If I must be honest," she said, "I went to see the new doctor."</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"To see which new doctor?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Anthony thingumy," said the girl carelessly. "He is a new-comer, and
  I have heard all sorts of queer stories about him."</p>

  <p>"Like&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>The girl hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Well," she smiled, "they say that he is half a barbarian, and that he is
  very good looking, and Bexley says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice laughed.</p>

  <p>"He has written to you, too, has he? I wonder what is his object in
  booming our dear Dr. Manton's nephew."</p>

  <p>The girl shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You know Bex," she said. "He is full of weird fads, he gets so awfully
  keen on people&mdash;I think he met this doctor man on the Congo when he was
  out shooting there."</p>

  <p>"I can tell you this "&mdash;Edward thought it an opportune moment to
  express his presence. "I can tell you this," he said with the gravity which
  the statement demanded, "our young man is an authority upon tropical
  diseases, and in his way is quite famous."</p>

  <p>The girl looked at her cousin with a little twinkle in her lovely
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"There is one question," she said solemnly, "that is distressing me. Does
  he church?"</p>

  <p>The Rector frowned, and turned the frown with admirable dexterity into his
  rigid smile.</p>

  <p>"That is a question I cannot answer," he said; "if he is like his uncle he
  will probably attend all the places of worship in Bulboro', and, in the
  course of time, be buried by them all."</p>

  <p>He had some work to do in his study, and made a ceremonious exit, relieved
  to escape from an atmosphere which was never especially friendly to
  himself.</p>

  <p>His relief was not unshared by the women he left behind. Geraldine pulled
  off her hat and flung it on to a distant chair with a sure aim, despite the
  murmured protest of her hostess.</p>

  <p>"You are a perfectly extravagant girl," smiled Lady Beatrice. "I shall be
  rather sorry for the man you marry." The girl looked at her.</p>

  <p>"I will be rather sorry myself," she said quietly, "but it will be such a
  long time before that tragedy, that I can well afford to postpone my
  reformation. Edward is rather keen on my marrying," she went on, settling
  herself in a corner of the settee as Lady Beatrice drew up her feet to give
  her room; "he positively gloats over the prospect of marrying me to some
  worthy young gentleman before the congregation of the elect. It would be
  awfully tough on Edward if I married a Catholic."</p>

  <p>The elder woman looked up sharply. "Do you mean Bexley?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The girl nodded.</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" she invited.</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice looked past her.</p>

  <p>"He is a very nice boy," she said slowly, "of course he has a lot of
  money, and is a sort of a baronet. You might do worse. Is he keen?"</p>

  <p>The girl nodded again, and there was laughter in her eyes. "They are all
  keen," she said. "I wish I could imbibe some of their enthusiasm for the
  blessed state."</p>

  <p>There was a little pause. Lady Beatrice was looking thoughtfully out of
  the window, and the girl was occupied with her own fancies.</p>

  <p>Beatrice withdrew her gaze from the lawn suddenly and asked:</p>

  <p>"I suppose you will include him amongst your victims?"</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said the girl, then asked quickly: "whom do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice smiled.</p>

  <p>"I think we are both thinking of the same man, this new doctor."</p>

  <p>Jerry pouted.</p>

  <p>"I do not know that I am very keen on those people," she said, "especially
  the too clever ones; they want to talk about themselves and microbes, and to
  discuss abstract questions which, under ordinary circumstances, one can
  escape by avoiding the higher-priced quarterlies. I saw Mrs. Gilby in town,"
  she went on; "she tells me that she went down with her daughter to the
  dispensary last night, and they had a view of our young man."</p>

  <p>"What was Mrs. Gilby's verdict?" asked the other with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Gilby was very emphatic"&mdash;the girl nodded her head
  seriously&mdash;"she said the young doctor is a bear, and had none of the
  manners of his uncle."</p>

  <p>"I do not remember his uncle's manners," said Lady Beatrice dryly. "My
  recollection of the dear old man was that he was something of a bear
  himself."</p>

  <p>The girl rose and came over to the table and poured out a cup of tea.</p>

  <p>"I will ring for some more," said Lady Beatrice. "For goodness' sake don't
  drink cold tea!"</p>

  <p>"Don't bother, please," smiled Geraldine. "I like this. I had rather a
  thick time last night."</p>

  <p>"That sounds pretty alarming," said Lady Beatrice; "exactly what does it
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"We danced till four," said Geraldine carelessly, "and I was bored to
  tears."</p>

  <p>"Where was this?"</p>

  <p>"At the Colebrookes."</p>

  <p>"Who was there?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody of note; that little Jewish gentleman, Cohen, was one of the
  family&mdash;Billy Colebrooke is rather keen on him You see, Billy wants to
  float his mines. Oh, yes," she said, as a sudden thought struck her, "and
  that Harburn woman is starting a new league."</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice frowned; she was suspicious of new leagues. Bulboro' was the
  home of quasi-philanthropic societies, in the formation of which she herself
  had generally taken the initiative. She did not readily forgive anything
  which was suggestive of rivalry, and the Harburn woman had not once, but many
  times, set herself in opposition to Church House.</p>

  <p>"What is the league?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Jerry threw back her head and laughed, a wholesome joyous laugh of genuine
  amusement.</p>

  <p>"It is the league of good advice," she said. "It is so like the Harburn
  woman. You see, the idea is that a lot of us shall band ourselves together
  and we shall make a systematic tour through Bulboro' looking for somebody who
  really needs help. We shan't give blankets, or coal or food tickets, or
  anything which costs money&mdash;but we shall give"&mdash;she paused
  dramatically&mdash;"advice. Yes, yes," she went on, eagerly, "it is the
  greatest fun. We shall lay our soothing hands upon their distressed brows and
  tell them just how and what they have to do.</p>

  <p>"If they want money we shall tell them who to get it from; if they want
  clothes we will recommend them good tailors; if they want advice on any
  subject under the sun, which does not cost money, we shall tell them. Billy
  wants to be a member; he has an idea, I think, that he might be able to work
  off some of those awful shares of his."</p>

  <p>"But, seriously?" asked Lady Beatrice.</p>

  <p>"It is perfectly true," the girl nodded, "they hope to enlist the
  sympathies and services of the Manton man just as soon as he gets acquainted
  with his uncle's patients."</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice rose.</p>

  <p>"What a weird creature the woman is," she said irritably. "She is not
  content to pull an oar with the rest of us but she wants to captain every
  boat she rows in."</p>

  <p>There was a little tap at the door, and the maid came in. She looked at
  Lady Beatrice and then at her visitor and hesitated. "What is it, Rachel?"
  asked her ladyship.</p>

  <p>"It's a man, m'lady," stammered the girl.</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice Wendall's eyes narrowed, and for the space of a second there
  was a hardness about the mouth that the girl had never remembered seeing
  before.</p>

  <p>"Who is the mysterious man?" she asked.</p>

  <p>She could take that liberty, for they had very few secrets from one
  another.</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It is a man I am helping, a man from the town," she said. "And he is
  rather a nuisance. Tell him I will see him in a few minutes," she said to the
  girl, and when the door closed behind her:</p>

  <p>"You would not think anybody would have the audacity to attempt to convert
  me to Nonconformity?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Jerry laughed.</p>

  <p>"You do not mean that?"</p>

  <p>"I do, indeed," Lady Beatrice nodded. "That is the truth," she said.</p>

  <p>"And pray what argument is he using?" asked Geraldine.</p>

  <p>A little frown settled between the eyes of the other. "A rather harsh
  one," she said shortly.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4">IV. &mdash; A GAME OF BRIDGE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Anthony Manton made no social calls for the first three
  weeks of his residence in Bulboro'&mdash;he was too busily occupied with the
  claims of the practice. There were some who may have come to him out of sheer
  curiosity, but there was a genuinely large amount of sickness. Influenza
  seemed to have laid half the inhabitants of Bulboro' low and to have kept the
  doctors busy day and night.</p>

  <p>He met men of his own profession, who did not resent his intrusion,
  accepting his inheritance of old Manton's kingdom without question.</p>

  <p>It would seem that aristocratic Bulboro' shared the views of Lady
  Beatrice, for he was not called in to prescribe for the West End, and it
  seemed that they had decided to wait until they had become acquainted with
  him socially, before they developed any of the distressing symptoms peculiar
  to the idle and the moneyed classes.</p>

  <p>He saw much of Ambrose Cohen in those days. The little man would drive
  over in the evenings, and spend a couple of hours in Anthony's study, smoking
  and discussing everything under the sun, save Bulboro' society. To this he
  made no further reference, and added nothing to the information which he
  offered at the station on the day of Tony's arrival.</p>

  <p>The town was one of strong antagonism, Anthony gathered, but he had no
  further demonstration of religious feeling until one night he was called to a
  case in Mansfield Street.</p>

  <p>He had been sent for by a distracted mother to find a youth of fifteen in
  a condition which suggested shock.</p>

  <p>The boy was a weakling and was unfitted, physically, to accept the
  flogging which had been given to him.</p>

  <p>The youngster's body was covered with weals, and the weeping mother
  admitted that he had suffered at the hands of his father.</p>

  <p>It was no part of Anthony's business to interfere with the exercising of a
  parent's right to chastise an errant son, but here was a case which might
  easily develop seriously. His stethoscope discovered a suggestion of
  pneumonia, a complication which might very easily follow upon so cruel a
  beating as the boy had received. The house was a decent one, in a decent
  thoroughfare, and the parents of the child were evidently fairly well-to-do
  people.</p>

  <p>Anthony made another examination of the shivering, moaning boy on the bed
  and wrote his prescription.</p>

  <p>When he had finished he rose.</p>

  <p>"Exactly why was this boy punished in this brutal way?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The woman hesitated.</p>

  <p>Before she could reply the door was flung open and a man came in. He was
  of the superior artisan type, below middle height, a wisp of black whisker
  covered the lower part of his thin face. His eyes were the eyes of a fanatic,
  his hair long and carefully brushed, and he faced Doctor Anthony Manton
  defiantly, his hands thrust in his trousers pockets, his head on one
  side.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to know why I flogged that boy, sir?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I have asked your wife," said Anthony calmly, "and as you seem to have
  been listening at the door it will be unnecessary for her to repeat my
  question."</p>

  <p>The man was ripe for argument, and his first words explained his creed in
  so far as his eavesdropping was concerned.</p>

  <p>"I have a right to listen to what I like in my own house," he said. "And I
  tell you this, that r flogged this boy to save his immortal soul."</p>

  <p>Anthony looked at him a little amazed.</p>

  <p>"You have considerably jeopardized his mortal body," he said dryly. "There
  may be a complication of pneumonia in this case, and if by any chance the boy
  dies I shall give evidence to this effect&mdash;in any case I shall report
  this matter."</p>

  <p>The man looked at him open mouthed.</p>

  <p>"Dies!" he said.</p>

  <p>Anthony nodded.</p>

  <p>"There is just a possibility that he will, in which case you will be tried
  for manslaughter. I do not think," he went on carefully, "that I have ever
  seen a more brutal case of flogging; and I have lived in a nigger country
  where atrocities of this character are supposed to abound. There is nothing I
  can imagine that the boy could have done that would have justified your
  cruelty."</p>

  <p>The old defiant look returned to the father's face.</p>

  <p>"You are speaking now, sir, to a God-fearing man, to one who has found
  Christ," he lifted his eyes to the ceiling automatically, "who has trod the
  way of salvation, who has accepted grace and redemption at his Saviour's
  hands. This is my son," he pointed vigorously to the bed, "a consorter with
  idolatrous people, who left my house the other night with a lie on his lips,
  saying that he was going to a Bible-reading, and who was seen by a brother in
  the devil's playhouse, absorbing filth of the modern Gomorrah. It is better,"
  he said, his voice trembling with passion, "that he should die by my hand
  than that his soul should go down to hell, damned beyond redemption."</p>

  <p>Anthony stared at the man calmly and coldly, and did not speak as the
  other babbled on with scraps from Scripture and glib phrases of
  admonition.</p>

  <p>Anthony looked at the boy again and recognized him. He was the lad he had
  seen in the vestibule of the theatre.</p>

  <p>When the father had finished, the doctor picked up his hat.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he said, and there were times when his voice had a cruel,
  piercing quality, "I do not know your name."</p>

  <p>"My name is Gill," said the man.</p>

  <p>Anthony bowed his head slightly.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Gill," he said, "I will tell you a few home-truths which may
  not interest you, and which you will probably reject in your arrogance"</p>

  <p>The man started.</p>

  <p>"I repeat, in your arrogance," said Anthony. "You will be surprised to
  learn that you are highly neurotic; you have no stamina, you have no
  particular reasoning power, and I should imagine very little education. To
  give way to your fury, and flog a boy as you have flogged this child, is a
  symptom of moral degeneracy. In other words," he said carefully, "you are
  almost as great a beast as any of the people you have just been abusing, only
  your beastliness takes another form. You can, if you wish, allow me to attend
  to this boy; if you do not wish you may call in another doctor. For my part,
  I consider it is my duty to report this matter to the police."</p>

  <p>"I am prepared to suffer," said the man, squaring his shoulders. "I am
  prepared to be persecuted even as my Master was, even as my dear pastor has
  been."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are one of Pastor Childe's children," smiled Anthony.</p>

  <p>"I am," said the man sternly. "I am, under God, the lay assistant of that
  blessed saint on earth, an unworthy pupil&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are unworthy all right," said Anthony with a little curl of his
  lips. He reached the door and turned round, and for a moment the men stood
  face to face. "Since I am a doctor in a civilized town," said Anthony, "I am
  prevented from taking the course that I should, if I were just an ordinary
  man and had to deal with you under these circumstances. Because," he added,
  half to himself, "I think I should have served you almost as badly as you
  have served your son. Good morning."</p>

  <p>The man, in an ungovernable fit of rage, followed him to the landing.</p>

  <p>"For two pins I would kick you out of the house," he said.</p>

  <p>"My friend," said Dr. Anthony Manton with an ugly little smile, "I should
  desire nothing better, but you are such a puny little devil that I dare not
  hope that you will put your threat into execution."</p>

  <p>He left the house unmolested.</p>

  <p>Perhaps an ordinary doctor, similarly circumstanced, might have felt it
  was not his duty to go any further than warning the parent, but Anthony
  Manton was independent alike of the support of Bulboro', the opinions of
  Bulboro', or the execration of Bulboro', and he made his way to the nearest
  police-station and reported the case.</p>

  <p>A week later another name was added to the list of Bulboro's martyrs, for
  Mr. John Gill was sent to prison for twenty-eight days without the option of
  a fine.</p>

  <p>Thus was Anthony Manton introduced to Bulboro' society. In normal
  circumstances he might have found his action universally approved, but
  Bulboro' was a city of partisans: no public man could make more than six
  enemies. He could never possibly hope to make six friends.</p>

  <p>You might estrange the Baptist and retain the Congregationalist, be
  utterly damned in the eyes of the Church, and entertained at tea by an
  enthusiastic Baptist congregation. You might be on speaking terms with Father
  Carter and his Romanist friends, and yet acquire no savour of happiness if
  you were to be affected by the sight of Mrs. Gamage crossing the road with
  great ostentation lest the fragrance of incense polluted her delicate
  nostrils&mdash;for Mrs. Gamage was the leader of the young women's league
  which was affiliated to the Baptists, and had a working arrangement with the
  Wesleyans.</p>

  <p>One important feature of intercommunal life must be recorded, and it is
  this: that you might remain friends with every sect, and with every
  sub-section of religious thought in Bulboro', always provided you were
  inclined to Wesleyanism and worshipped openly under the Reverend George
  Haverstock. For the Wesleyans are the Holy Romans of the Nonconformist world,
  have greater confidence in their method of worship than the most bigoted of
  Ritualists, yet are sufficiently tolerant of other methods to admit that they
  might be right.</p>

  <p>Anthony Manton's action was approved by at least three sections of
  religious thought in Bulboro', and for three different reasons. It was
  approved by the Church of England because it conveyed to those uninitiated
  Church people, who were hovering everlastingly on the brink of Nonconformity,
  that that section which Mr. Gill represented was cruel to children. It was
  welcomed by the Congregationalists, because the unfortunate man who was
  serving out his martyrdom in Bulboro' jail had been the sternest critic of
  their political propaganda. It was welcomed by a large party made up of all
  sects who overtly or covertly disliked the imprisoned man.</p>

  <p>The case revealed Anthony Manton in a light which was not favourable to
  himself There was talk of an open boycott, but since the boycott could only
  be directed against the free dispensary, and since the free dispensary could
  not in any way be injured by the abstention of malcontents, the boycott was
  abandoned, and indeed the whole agitation, which arose like a sudden storm in
  an Indian ocean, died as suddenly, and the after-thunder of an electric
  controversy was heard only in the mutter of correspondence in the <i>Bulboro'
  Herald</i>.</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice read the account, but she had had a fuller report from her
  husband, who, in his dual capacity of ecclesiastical authority and Justice of
  the Peace, had attended the court.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she said, "I am awfully glad this Gill man has got into
  serious trouble, but I do not know whether it was wise of our young Dr.
  Manton. What do you think, Jerry?"</p>

  <p>They were dining together on the evening following the police-court
  proceedings. Jerry reached out for the <i>petits-fours</i>.</p>

  <p>"I think he is going to be rather a bore," she said carelessly, "I rather
  dislike these horrible reformers, especially the melodramatic ones. Of course
  the man was a beast and all that, and deserved all that could be given to
  him, but one likes one's friends to be rather less in the limelight."</p>

  <p>"You will have an opportunity of meeting him to-night," said the
  Rector.</p>

  <p>He glanced at his wife, as he invariably did, for her approval. "I met him
  to-day," he went on, "and asked him to come along after dinner; he plays
  bridge apparently."</p>

  <p>"But that is rather an odd way of bringing a man into one's family circle,
  isn't it?" Lady Beatrice asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>"He is rather an unusual man," apologized Heron Wendall, "and he seems
  pretty busy."</p>

  <p>"But why didn't you ask him to dinner?" asked his wife.</p>

  <p>"He never dines out," the Rector hastened to explain. "I repeat, my dear,
  he is a most extraordinary man, and you have either got to take him just as
  you find him or else cut out all idea of meeting him. You will never get him
  to your afternoons."</p>

  <p>She made no reply. The result of to-night's visit would prove the wisdom
  or otherwise of her husband's action.</p>

  <p>Anthony came soon after nine. A thinnish man they thought him in his dress
  suit, though he was well shaped. His brown face showed the browner against
  the white of his evening dress; he was neither embarrassed by the warm
  greeting of Lady Beatrice nor made uncomfortable by the casual reception he
  received at the hands of the beautiful Miss Brand.</p>

  <p>"We have just been hearing about you," said the girl, when the
  conventional exchanges had been made.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he replied shortly.</p>

  <p>The girl looked at him with interest. Was he going to be a bore or would
  he develop humorously?</p>

  <p>"You are quite a hero in the eyes of Bulboro'," she said.</p>

  <p>"Which is Bulboro'?" he asked calmly, "the Bulboro' of The Chad or the
  Bulboro' of West Hill?"</p>

  <p>"A little of both," she smiled.</p>

  <p>"Bulboro's conception of heroism," he said, "is, I am afraid, rather
  crude."</p>

  <p>He did not intend to be offensive&mdash;even to unconscious Bulboro'; he
  was stating what he thought was an obvious fact.</p>

  <p>"It is rather a wretched place, don't you think?" he went on, "to the man
  who thinks and feels, it is an impossible place; it is so horribly compact,
  so horribly complacent, so horribly complete in itself&mdash;complete without
  any outside assistance. One can imagine a giant hand clipping away Bulboro'
  from the world and leaving frayed ends of telegraph wires and railway lines,
  and Bulboro' going on its way for a thousand years without realizing that it
  was isolated."</p>

  <p>"What a horrible prospect!" she shuddered.</p>

  <p>He agreed with a nod.</p>

  <p>They had gone into the drawing-room, where card-tables had been set
  out.</p>

  <p>He cut Geraldine as his partner, an unfortunate happening, because
  Geraldine was an expert player and was moreover somewhat imperious in her
  attitude towards her partners.</p>

  <p>It was good fun if you loved Geraldine, and all men of her age loved her
  almost automatically. It was amusing if you were old enough to see the
  humorous side of it. She had never yet had the bad luck to cut with a partner
  who was young and sufficiently oblivious to her charms to be resentful of her
  criticism. He seated himself opposite with a smile and said:</p>

  <p>"I hope, Miss Brand, that you are not a very exacting player, I am afraid
  my bridge is very poor."</p>

  <p>She made a little face, but recovered herself with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"So many people say that," she said, "only to invite expressions of
  admiration later on in the game."</p>

  <p>He was not an ideal player, as she was soon to discover. He conveyed the
  impression (with reason) that his mind was occupied elsewhere&mdash;a fatal
  quality in a bridge player and especially exasperating to one who takes the
  game seriously.</p>

  <p>Before the first hand had been played she had addressed two or three
  characteristically cutting remarks to this acquaintance of an evening.</p>

  <p>They were such as would have passed unnoticed in her own set or excited no
  more than an embarrassed giggle or two from the youth of her
  acquaintance.</p>

  <p>Anthony Manton began by being amused, passed into a brief stage of
  irritation (not unnatural) and ended by making a swift appraisement of this
  girl, an appraisement which was neither complimentary nor unkind.</p>

  <p>He lost the rubber&mdash;it was auction&mdash;with five hundred points
  down. The girl was very serious; bridge was something more than a
  recreation.</p>

  <p>She did not gamble; the money value of the points did not count, but a
  <i>faux pas</i> at bridge was a deplorable exhibition in her eyes, and a
  lapse of table manners. A man leading from the ace-queen stood on the same
  bench of social degradation as the outsider who took a dessert spoon to his
  peas.</p>

  <p>"You are a perfectly awful player," she said frankly. She was flushed, and
  really annoyed.</p>

  <p>"Aren't I?" agreed Anthony. "I warned you."</p>

  <p>"I hope you are a better doctor," she said with the calm insolence of
  masterful youth and commanding beauty.</p>

  <p>He looked at her oddly for a moment and held her eyes.</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice saw the storm brewing, and was nervous. Dr. Anthony Manton
  was a new type of creature for whom she had no exact formula.</p>

  <p>"Cut, Jerry," she said. "Cut again and possibly you will get Edward; we
  have had all the luck."</p>

  <p>But the girl was in her most stubborn mood. This young man had not
  yielded, had neither been flustered nor penitent, had not worshipped at the
  shrine where the knees of all manner of men had bent. Instead he regarded her
  with a sort of good-natured hostility.</p>

  <p>"I do not think I will play any more," she said, and the words had hardly
  left her lips when she realized the extent of her gaucherie.</p>

  <p>"You think me horrid, don't you?" she said quickly, and smiled at the
  young man.</p>

  <p>"I think you are rather spoilt," he said quietly. "I have heard so much
  about you, and I am a little disappointed."</p>

  <p>The girl went red and white; nobody had ever dared speak to her like this;
  what was left of her reason told her that the man was at least outraging
  certain conventions.</p>

  <p>She might have withdrawn and carried the day with her, but this was a new
  experience&mdash;never before had she met a man who had dared to treat her so
  rudely.</p>

  <p>"You have absolutely no right," she breathed, "to tell me you are
  disappointed in me; I have never had such an impertinence addressed to
  me."</p>

  <p>He was still looking at her; his eyes had not left her face. He was
  perfectly calm and self-possessed.</p>

  <p>"It was an impertinence on your part," he said quietly, "to refer to my
  play and compare my skill as a doctor with my genius as a card player. That
  was unpardonable, even from a young and inexperienced girl, because I suppose
  that even here in Bulboro' you were taught certain conventions must be
  observed. I suppose I had better go," he said with a smile, and received no
  encouragement to remain.</p>

  <p>The Rector saw him to the door, and was murmuring polite regrets, but
  since he could remember no precedent to such a situation, he went back to the
  drawing-room with the discomforting sense that, whatever else had happened,
  he would be held responsible. He came back prepared to meet a gathering
  storm, and was agreeably surprised to find that the girl and his wife were
  laughing.</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary," he said.</p>

  <p>"But don't you think he was abominable?"</p>

  <p>The Rector looked at Lady Beatrice, but found no beam of light to lead him
  to the right path.</p>

  <p>"It was extraordinary," he repeated safely.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5">V. &mdash; LADY BEATRICE'S PAST</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Anthony Manton did not occupy his uncle's old pew at St.
  Mary's on the following Sunday.</p>

  <p>At least three pairs of eyes watched that pew furtively, but if the truth
  be told, Anthony had forgotten that such a thing as attendance at church was
  expected of him He had lived so long in the wilds and had so concentrated his
  philosophy and his creed that it never occurred to him that Sunday might be
  spent in any other way than that in which he spent his week-days.</p>

  <p>The sound of the discordance of church bells ringing in various tones was
  the first hint he received of his deflection. He looked up from the
  microscope at which he was engaged, and stared thoughtfully out of the
  window, then he walked to the fire-place and pushed the bell. He had retained
  all his uncle's old servants, and Jocks, the butler, answered the call.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jocks," said Anthony, looking over his shoulder as the other entered,
  "did my uncle go to church?"</p>

  <p>"He attended places of worship, sir," said Jocks, a little solemnly.</p>

  <p>"Exactly what places of worship?" asked Anthony.</p>

  <p>"He attended them all, sir, in their turn."</p>

  <p>Anthony smiled.</p>

  <p>"The dear old man, how characteristic of him I wonder if I am expected to
  go to church," he said, half aloud.</p>

  <p>Jocks opened his mouth to offer a suggestion, and thought better of it. He
  was a Churchman, and took religion as seriously as any other respectable
  citizen in Bulboro'. If he might not suggest that his master could be more
  profitably employed seeking his soul's salvation than amusing himself with a
  microscope and messy little patches of dried blood, he could at least offer a
  point of view more in keeping with his position and affecting one who was of
  his class.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>Anthony looked up.</p>

  <p>"I have had a little conversation with cook," said Jocks in his profound
  way, "a Mrs. Chalmers, and a God-fearing woman, sir."</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt," agreed Anthony gravely.</p>

  <p>"And Mrs. Chalmers, sir," Jocks went on, "has wondered whether you would
  mind our endeavouring to say a word of gospel to&mdash;" He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" encouraged Anthony.</p>

  <p>"Your nigger servant."</p>

  <p>"You must not say nigger," said Anthony. "I realize that you are intensely
  ignorant on the question of racial distinction, but Ahmet is a Mohammedan and
  a Moor."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, sir," said Jocks politely.</p>

  <p>"Well: what about Ahmet?" asked Anthony.</p>

  <p>He was almost prepared for the reply.</p>

  <p>"We had thought, sir," said Jocks, with that deliberation which was so
  annoying to his master, "Mrs. Chalmers and I, that possibly we might lead Mr.
  Ahmet to what I might term a different point of view."</p>

  <p>"Religiously speaking, I presume," said Anthony.</p>

  <p>"Exactly, sir," said Mr. Jocks.</p>

  <p>"In fact," said Anthony with a smile, "you would like to have the credit
  of converting a good heathen to your religion?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, exactly, sir," said Mr. Jocks again.</p>

  <p>"What religion are you converting him from, have you troubled to find
  out?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Jocks smiled.</p>

  <p>"I take it, sir, that he has no religion."</p>

  <p>"Are you going through life," asked the irritated Anthony, "under the
  impression that Christianity is the only religion that is offered to the
  world?"</p>

  <p>"The only true religion, sir," said the prim Jocks. Anthony thought for a
  moment, then he said:</p>

  <p>"Well, try your hand on Ahmet You will find," he went on, "some slight
  difficulty in stating your wishes to him, and a greater difficulty I should
  imagine in persuading him to leave a faith, which is only sub-divided into
  two sections, for one which is divided into two and fifty. Also," he went on,
  "you might find it a task reconciling him to a form of religion which offers
  him little material comfort in this life and a condition in the next which
  would be entirely distasteful to a man of his naturally voluptuous
  habits."</p>

  <p>If Mr. Jocks had any idea of including in the scheme the reformation of
  his master&mdash;and who else could he obtain as an interpreter?&mdash;he was
  doomed to disappointment.</p>

  <p>Anthony finished the morning, and incidentally completed the work on which
  he was engaged, called to see three of his patients before luncheon, and
  spent the afternoon profitably in preparing his report of the growth of
  sleeping sickness in the Itrui Forest.</p>

  <p>The evening found him at the Free Dispensary, and nine o'clock brought him
  back to the house again. Jocks had returned from church.</p>

  <p>"There is a gentleman waiting to see you, sir; I have put him in the
  dining-room."</p>

  <p>"To see me?" asked Anthony in surprise: he was following his uncle's
  practice in keeping his house free from encroachments of consultations, and
  to this end he had a little office on The Chad where he might be seen at set
  hours. He had made it known, in the short time he was in Bulboro', that his
  uncle's repugnance to a practice carried on at his own home was shared by
  himself.</p>

  <p>"A Mr. Patten," whispered the butler, significantly.</p>

  <p>"Patten, Patten," the name suggested nothing to Anthony. "Ask him to come
  into the library," he said.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later Jocks ushered in a young man, clean shaven and smartly
  dressed. His dark curly hair and his dark eyes gave him a foreign
  appearance.</p>

  <p>He bowed to the doctor.</p>

  <p>"I am Augustus Patten," he said. "You probably know my name."</p>

  <p>Anthony smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I know very few names in England," he said. "I have been away
  so long. Won't you sit down?"</p>

  <p>The young man seated himself with care, and Anthony waited.</p>

  <p>"I owe you an apology," said the visitor, "for coming here at this hour of
  the night, the more so since I know that you do not care to receive patients
  here except in case of urgency, but I offer in extenuation the fact that I am
  not a patient," he smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am very glad," said Anthony. "In what other way can I serve you?</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;" The young man seemed at some loss to find the words he
  wanted. "I am awfully interested in this case in which you were concerned the
  other day, personally interested, in fact," he said. "I am the proprietor of
  the Theatre Royal, you will possibly see no association"</p>

  <p>An association had dawned on Anthony's mind, but he did not assist the
  other.</p>

  <p>"I am interested in a girl," said the young man slowly. Anthony looked at
  him.</p>

  <p>"In a girl?" he repeated. "Which particular girl are you interested in,
  and how am I concerned?"</p>

  <p>"She is the daughter of Gill," said the young man. "You probably know he
  has a daughter; she is sixteen, a very charming girl, leading a perfect hell
  of a life," he went on earnestly. "You can hardly realize, doctor, what a
  horrible place such a home can be to a high-spirited girl, an artist to her
  finger tips, a natural actress, with all the enthusiasm of youth. The boy who
  was punished has been a brick," he went on disjointedly. "He was really
  protecting his sister. She was very keen on the stage." He hesitated again.
  "She was in the theatre on the night this boy was seen."</p>

  <p>"I do not wish to interrupt you," said Anthony, "but for the life of me I
  cannot see how I am going to help you. I happen to know that this lady was in
  your theatre that night, and that her father has conscientious scruples
  concerning the stage. But what can I do?" asked Anthony, good-humouredly.
  "The father is not likely to be influenced by my opinion when he comes out of
  jail."</p>

  <p>"I thought you might be able to advise me," said the young man, a little
  crestfallen.</p>

  <p>Anthony shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said kindly, "but you mustn't get the impression that I
  am a quixotic individual, wandering through life championing the oppressed.
  It happened in this case," he went on, "that the injury to the boy was such
  that no medical man could pass over without placing himself in the position
  of an accomplice; besides," he went on, "I do not know what advice you
  want."</p>

  <p>"Isn't there a way the girl can be taken out of his care?"</p>

  <p>"That is a question for a lawyer, not for a doctor," said Anthony shortly.
  "I should imagine that you will have some difficulty. You are not the only
  young man in the world," he said with a smile, "who wishes to find a
  ready-made method of removing a girl from the influence of her parents. I
  presume you wish to marry the lady?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Patten laughed.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, no!" he said, "it is really her art I am thinking about. I am
  certain she will be a great actress; her rendering of a part I had specially
  written for her was perfect."</p>

  <p>"Then I understand your interest is purely a business one," said Anthony,
  as he showed his visitor out.</p>

  <p>"In a sense, yes," said the young man</p>

  <p>Anthony went back to his study a little thoughtful.</p>

  <p>What was being said about him did not particularly worry him, but he had
  the greatest objection in the world to being bothered at all hours of the day
  or night, by people with grievances and causes requiring a doughty champion.
  That promised to be a nuisance.</p>

  <p>He took down his pipe from the study mantelpiece and filled it
  abstractedly.</p>

  <p>His mind should have been filled with the subject of the treatise he was
  preparing for the <i>Journal of Tropical Medicine</i>, but in some
  unaccountable way a train of thought which his visitor had set in motion had
  gone puffing up West Hill to Church House, through the lavender-scented
  hallway into a drawing-room where there had stood a very angry girl.</p>

  <p>He had not regretted that evening any more than he would have regretted a
  night spent under uncomfortable circumstances in a tropical forest&mdash;if
  thereby he had enlarged the field of his knowledge.</p>

  <p>The Church House drawing-room was incomparable to a tropical jungle, and
  Lady Beatrice might well resent the comparison.</p>

  <p>He had not met any of the members of that unhappy card party since that
  night. He smiled grimly, he did not anticipate any further invitations to the
  rectory. If any emotion stirred in him it was one of sentimental regret that
  he might be spoiling a practice which his uncle had built up with much
  labour, and that he was, in a sense, disappointing those who had associated
  the name of Manton with all that was genial, and kindly, and forbearing.</p>

  <p>Yet in his heart of hearts he knew that he had taken no action of which
  his uncle would not have offered his complete approval.</p>

  <p>The girl was spoilt. She was intensely pretty, he thought, but she was too
  well aware of the fact. Her world had narrowed down to the limited confines
  of the admiring circle which constantly surrounded her, and she had
  restricted her outlook until it did not extend beyond the ring of bowed and
  carefully brushed heads by which she was everlastingly encircled.</p>

  <p>What sort of a man would she marry, he wondered, what life would be hers?
  He could in a sketchy way imagine her the grand lady with social engagements
  booked ahead, with all the exactness of detail which might accompany the
  booking of a music-hall star.</p>

  <p>He might imagine her the mother of one or two duty children, whose arrival
  would release her for a life of mild gaieties, free forever from further
  responsibilities of motherhood, a life greatly devoted to securing the
  complexion and the figure of the <i>status quo ante bellum</i>&mdash;for that
  part of marriage was war to the society woman.</p>

  <p>Dr. Anthony Manton was narrow in certain aspects. Science, if it broadens
  some perceptions, narrows others, and the greatest danger is that which
  threatens the spiritual side of those whose lives are devoted to learning the
  exactness of material manifestations. Science cannot reasonably allow for a
  soul, unless it can discover in the pure ether of abstract spirituality the
  merest material speck to which it may attach a label: or from it cut a
  segment for microscopic examination. It does not know temperament, save in
  its relation to digestion or the complexities of sex. Emotion is hysteria,
  ecstasy is madness, inspiration either demonstrates the occasionally normal,
  or the infrequently abnormal condition of the human brain.</p>

  <p>Largely speaking, science does not interest itself greatly in the human
  ego, and it is too hasty, too precise in its diagnosis of motive, to deserve
  any other appellation than narrow.</p>

  <p>Anthony Manton had spent a great part of his life amongst simple and
  wholesome folk, who were sheer animal, in the sense that they were able to
  describe their primitive ailments frankly. Such medical work as he had done
  in Africa had been all the easier because he had to deal with a race of
  people which secretly destroyed their chronic invalids, put to death their
  halt and their lame, and did not allow their very old people to die a natural
  death. Civilization and Bulboro' made a point of honour of preserving the
  unfit and offering its most tender succour to the superfluous.</p>

  <p>He sat down at his table and wrote steadily up till eleven o'clock. It was
  at this hour that he looked up to the mantelpiece to see the time. He rang
  the bell. He rang twice, when the soft-footed Ahmet, with his clean white
  jellab, came noiselessly into the room, bearing a copper tray on which stood
  the paraphernalia for coffee-making.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Ahmet," said Anthony in Arabic, "what think you of this strange
  town?"</p>

  <p>The man was groping in the bosom of his blouse for a box of matches, and
  these he found before he answered. Then he squatted down, lighting the spirit
  stove under the kettle. He answered without looking up.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I think that all towns are the same, yet I never saw people so sad
  on a feast day."</p>

  <p>"On a feast day?" repeated Anthony with a smile. Ahmet nodded.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I thought there would be great joy and fireworks," he said simply,
  "for the gongs were beating all over the town, bol, bol, bol," he mimicked,
  "and in the street there was a band of music, and a man with a great red
  banner, and all the people were shouting noisily, so I put on my things and
  went down to see such sights, but lord, the bazaars were shut up, and there
  was no noise in the streets. Also all the people I saw were very solemn, and
  they all walked by two and two slowly, carrying books. Now," he said, "it
  seems to me that some great man has died that these people should be so sad:
  they were all in black, and their women were walking two and two also,
  looking so mournful that they almost made me cry."</p>

  <p>"And what did you do, Ahmet?" asked Anthony, amused.</p>

  <p>Ahmet, with great care, was pouring the boiling water from the little
  copper saucepan into the brew. He waited till he had carefully fixed the lid,
  staring at his work with that childlike, wondering stare which is the
  native's special trait.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he said, "I walked until I heard the music playing, and then I ran
  to it, and followed the shouting people about the town, and the music was
  very beautiful." He was silent for a moment, then added, "But there was no
  gun-play."</p>

  <p>The picture of a disappointed Ahmet marching through the streets of
  Bulboro' behind a Salvation Army band and waiting for fireworks tickled
  Anthony.</p>

  <p>"Lord," the man went on, "this day I met a Kano boy who cooks on one of
  the ships" (there is a seaport within twenty miles of Bulboro'), "and he
  tells me of these people, that they go in their sadness and in their
  blackness, walking two and two, and also that the bazaars are closed, to the
  glory of God. On this day there shall be no joyousness until sunset, when all
  the drinking shops will be opened. But these people of Bulboro' are divided
  into two parts," he went on, and Anthony listened without a muscle of his
  face moving. "These are they who worship in the morning," he ticked them off
  on his fingers, "and in the evening, and in the afternoon, and all the time,
  doing nothing which will make any man smile or happy, but being sad for this
  day because this is God's day. They think it pleasing to Him that they should
  be miserable. And there are those who worship neither in the morning, nor in
  the afternoon, but who wait until sunset and the drinking shops are opened,
  or, until the playhouse is opened, where a man may see many strange pictures
  of foreign lands. And these are divided thus, master," he said, "that those
  who go to church do not go to the pictures or to the drinking shops, and
  those who go to the pictures and the drinking shops do not go to church, and
  the only difference between them is that one of these is happy and the other
  dare not be happy, lest he offend his God."</p>

  <p>"Oh, ho!" said Anthony in polite astonishment</p>

  <p>Ahmet's perverse lecture was interrupted by Mr. Jocks.</p>

  <p>"May I see you a moment, sir?" he said, importantly.</p>

  <p>"You may say anything you wish to say before Ahmet, Jocks," said Anthony.
  "He is not very well acquainted with our language."</p>

  <p>"There is a lady to see you, sir," said Mr. Jocks, lowering his voice. He
  was all aquiver with excitement, and conveyed the impression that something
  immensely important had happened, as indeed in Jocks' eyes it had.</p>

  <p>"A lady to see me?" said Anthony. He looked at the clock. "Is she
  ill?"</p>

  <p>Jocks sidled to the desk, still mysterious, and unnecessarily lowering his
  voice to a throaty whisper, he said:</p>

  <p>"It is Lady Heron Wendall, sir." And stepped back to see the effect of his
  words.</p>

  <p>Eleven o'clock, thought Anthony, and frowned.</p>

  <p>A word with Ahmet sent him stealing from the room, carrying his coffee
  utensils jealously.</p>

  <p>"Show Lady Heron Wendall in, please."</p>

  <p>Anthony made a hasty attempt to tidy his study; it was not the sort of
  place in which he would care to receive a lady visitor, but it did not occur
  to him to see her anywhere else.</p>

  <p>She came in very cheerful, and conveyed no suggestion that her visit was
  of unusual importance. Yet he knew by the something he saw in her face that
  the call might well have unusual consequences. In this he was not
  mistaken.</p>

  <p>"What a dear little room," said Lady Beatrice, after she had shaken hands
  with the doctor.</p>

  <p>She did not sit down in the chair which he had brought forward for her,
  but strolled about the room in an easy confident way, looking at the pictures
  and the prints which had been the old doctor's delight, and examining the
  additions which Anthony had made to the collection of foreign arms which hung
  on the wall.</p>

  <p>"I have been in this room many times, you will be surprised to learn," she
  said, "and although it is not exactly associated with all the happiest
  memories of my life, I like this study."</p>

  <p>She turned to him.</p>

  <p>"Doctor," she said, "I want to apologize for my guest's rudeness the other
  night."</p>

  <p>"Oh, please don't talk about that," he laughed. "It is more than kind of
  you to put it in that way. The rudeness was all mine. You see, I am hardly
  civilized yet let that stand as my excuse."</p>

  <p>"I don't think any of us are very civilized," said Lady Beatrice.</p>

  <p>He thought she looked beautiful in the close-fitting gown she wore. The
  fashion of the day suited this slim woman admirably. She was cast in that
  aristocratic mould which excuses a delicacy of outline because of its grace
  of carriage. Framed in the black circle of a little hat worn low over her
  red-brown hair, the face was aesthetic.</p>

  <p>She looked younger than when he had seen her before, and that quaint word
  that his uncle had employed in his letter to him recurred to his mind. The
  caducity of Lady Beatrice was not apparent. If, as the word implied, her
  beauty was the beauty of a dying thing, she had hidden the decay of it.</p>

  <p>"I want to see you," she said, "and I have chosen this time for a very
  good reason. I might tell you that I am supposed to be on my way to the
  Brands, but if you can give me ten minutes, that will suffice."</p>

  <p>"I can give you all the time you want, Lady Beatrice," said Anthony
  Manton. "In what way can I be of assistance to you?"</p>

  <p>"That is horribly formal," she smiled. "But I don't see exactly what else
  you could say. Were you ever at a place called Mishimi?" She was examining
  one of the rings on her hand as she asked the question.</p>

  <p>"Mishimi?" said Anthony. "Yes, I know Mishimi; I was stationed there for
  some years. It was the expedition base."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever meet a man there?" She stopped and regarded the ring more
  fixedly, bringing it nearer to her eyes, as though she sought to read in the
  depths of the oval diamond which adorned it inspiration and encouragement for
  what she had to say. "A man named Lefevre?"</p>

  <p>So that was it, thought Anthony. He had wondered exactly how the subject
  would rise, whether she would ever introduce it; whether she was aware that
  he knew her secret.</p>

  <p>"I knew Lefevre rather well," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>There was another long silence. Suddenly she dropped her hand and looked
  him straight in the face.</p>

  <p>"He died under your care, did he not?"</p>

  <p>Anthony nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said; "literally, he died in my arms."</p>

  <p>"Was he happy?"</p>

  <p>The voice was a little sharp.</p>

  <p>"I think he was happy," said Anthony, "as happy as a man can be for whom
  the world holds pleasant and precious memories."</p>

  <p>"How did he look? I mean when you saw him. Could you describe him to me? I
  will sit down, because I see you are still standing."</p>

  <p>She sat down quickly in the chair by the side of the desk.</p>

  <p>"He was a tall man and rather a handsome man, I thought." She nodded.</p>

  <p>"He had a little short, clipped beard, a very refined delicate face, and
  large brown eyes. The upper part of his face was almost effeminate."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," she agreed quickly.</p>

  <p>"When I saw him he was ill; he had a bad bout of malaria, and I think he
  got a chill on top of that."</p>

  <p>"Did he ever&mdash;speak of&mdash;any of his friends?" she asked. Her face
  was set and eager, wistful in its desire for knowledge, hungry for the crumbs
  of information he could give her.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he spoke of you," said Anthony quietly; "not by your name, but by a
  nickname."</p>

  <p>"Oh, did he, did he?" she said eagerly. "What was the name?"</p>

  <p>"Bibi."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she breathed, and the colour went surging up to her face and receded
  again, leaving her pale. But there was a light in her eyes that Anthony had
  never seen in the eyes of any woman. "Bibi!" she repeated. "Oh, how
  wonderful!"</p>

  <p>Her hands were clasped on the desk by her side.</p>

  <p>"And you saw him, and spoke to him, and heard him; you touched him?"</p>

  <p>She reached out almost timidly and touched his hand.</p>

  <p>"With that hand&mdash;with that," she said, half to herself. "You saw him,
  and spoke to him, and heard him; oh, what a wonderful privilege!"</p>

  <p>She stared at him, and he saw the tears coming up into her eyes and laid
  his hand on her arm.</p>

  <p>"Lady Beatrice," he said quietly, "you have to be very wise and very brave
  about this. I will tell you everything I know, and do everything I can to
  make the story easy for you, and there is nothing hard to tell," he added
  quickly. "He died full of courage, with a smile, and your name was the last
  word on his lips."</p>

  <p>"You are saying that"&mdash;her voice trembled&mdash;"you are saying that
  to please me, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I would not lie to please you, or to please any human being in the world,
  I think. Here I am speaking the truth. Just before he died he tried to say
  something, and I thought he wanted to give me some instructions, and I bent
  my head to listen to discover that he was unconscious, for the words he said
  were 'Bibi' and then 'Beatrice'."</p>

  <p>"He said that? How&mdash;how did he say it?"</p>

  <p>She was half in tears, half smiling.</p>

  <p>"Did he say 'Be-ah-trice'&mdash;so?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is how he used to say it."</p>

  <p>She got up quickly and walked to the other end of the room.</p>

  <p>"And you saw him!" she said. "That is wonderful. Why you are almost a
  sacred being, Anthony Manton. I can almost enshrine you, because I know that
  in the end you were as gentle, and good, and kind as an English doctor and an
  English gentleman could be to a man."</p>

  <p>She walked to the end of the room, and with her back to him she dried her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"You know everything, don't you?" she said, turning. "I know you
  do&mdash;but you do not know how I am feeling, or how I have felt, all these
  long years&mdash;sixteen years," she said, "and I am thirty-five. I was
  eighteen when I met him. Sixteen years. Oh, Henri!" she wailed, "the father
  of my child! My God, my God!" And she knelt down by the side of the desk and
  buried her head in her arms.</p>

  <p>Anthony stood there, looking down at the shaking shoulders of this woman,
  and pitied her as he had never pitied a human being before in his life. He
  walked to a bureau at the other end of the room, opened the drawer, and
  pulled out a little box. It was a square box of hard African wood, and was
  sealed on both sides of the lid. He came back to her and laid his hand on her
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Lady Beatrice," he said gently, "I want to tell you something, and I want
  to make you an offer."</p>

  <p>She got up, drying her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry," she said ruefully; "I have made quite a fool of
  myself."</p>

  <p>"I want to show you something," he said again, taking no notice of her
  condition. "It will probably make you feel just as bad as you have been, but
  I must take that risk," he smiled. "Here are his belongings." He laid his
  hand upon the box. "I recognize that you cannot take them to your own house,
  or that you may not wish to. I am putting them in here." He lifted the box,
  and opened a neat cupboard by the side of the fireplace, which old Dr. Manton
  had used as a safe deposit, for the door was of inch-thick oak.</p>

  <p>"The seals, as you see, are unbroken. I will leave the box here." He
  suited the action to the word. "Close the door and lock it. Here is the key,"
  he said. "You can come in just when you like. There is a private door to
  Pilgrim's Rest. I will give you a time-table of the hours I am not at home.
  Keep the box here, and come back just as often as you like."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand; her lips quivered, she could not trust herself to
  speak.</p>

  <p>"I must go now," she said after a while. "Good-bye and thank you."</p>

  <p>He showed her to the door, and stood in the porch as the droning motor
  wormed its meandering way through the drive, carrying her, as he hoped, to
  temporary oblivion.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6">VI. &mdash; SIR JOHN BRAND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Augustus Patten sat in the holland-covered stalls of the
  Royal Theatre, and he was unusually affable. He was a notable young man,
  perfectly attired, and he displayed none of those errors of taste which are
  popularly associated with the successful theatrical manager. From the
  polished tips of his French boots to the crown of his correctly covered head
  he was soberly but expensively arrayed.</p>

  <p>He was a handsome youth with his sallow colouring and his clean-cut
  features. He was talking now in tones of equality to the man at his side, who
  might have been of any age between forty-five and fifty-five, and was a
  fresh-coloured type of a good-looking Englishman, with the features and the
  indefinable something which tells of breed.</p>

  <p>His eyes were kindly and inclined to laughter, his brown hair was
  carefully barbered as that of the young man by his side.</p>

  <p>Sir John Brand was a man with a record of gallantry behind him. "And,
  please God, before me, too," he had said, when he had read an unkindly
  comment in a London newspaper upon his too frequent visits to the Divorce
  Court in one capacity or another. It might be said that only once had he gone
  there as a respondent, when his second wife had divorced him to the scandal
  of the county.</p>

  <p>Geraldine Brand had been a small girl then. But she had grown up into a
  knowledge that there were certain columns of the newspaper everlastingly
  denied to her.</p>

  <p>"Daddy's name is always in the paper," she had said proudly to the
  reproving governess, who had checked her youthful curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Not always, my dear," said the prim maiden lady who led the child along
  the thorny path of knowledge; "there are some days when there is no reference
  to your papa at all."</p>

  <p>She did not intend to be humorous, but only to explain in the simple
  language understandable to childhood, that the ban on the <i>Daily
  Telegraph</i> was not a permanent one.</p>

  <p>Society is at once broad-minded and discriminating. If there is an
  exclusive set which turns its back upon the weak members of its order, or
  sends to Coventry the men and women who have fallen from grace, be sure that
  is not "Society."</p>

  <p>Complete exclusiveness has no greater claim to true refinement than
  indiscriminate reception. The ducal house which bars the Jew acts in no
  better taste than does the successful stockbroker of humble origin who admits
  all and sundry to the hospitality of his home.</p>

  <p>There are degrees and sub-divisions of vulgarity. It is undoubtedly vulgar
  to be mixed up in a divorce case of any kind, but there are some divorce
  cases which, though they might offer instances of collective vulgarity, are
  unmarked by any specific departure from the convention which paradoxically
  governs irregularities.</p>

  <p>Sir John had never been vulgar in the particular sense of the word;
  moreover, he had observed certain rules of decency. He had never flaunted his
  weakness in the face of his friends and acquaintances, and when unfortunate
  circumstances made it necessary for him to go abroad, he invariably avoided
  those crowded spots of the earth which are as so many suburbs to London. Then
  you might look in vain for Sir John at St. Moritz in the months of December
  and January, Marienbad would not know him in August, though Monte Cattini
  might.</p>

  <p>When the world of fashion was sunning itself before Shepheard's Hotel in
  Cairo, Sir John might be found in as warm a clime, in perhaps as pleasant
  surroundings, but without the companionship of his kind.</p>

  <p>He had a charming manner, spoke easily and fluently, conveying the
  impression that his hearer was the one person in the world with whom he
  wished to converse, and whose views were of any worth.</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully obliged to you," he said after a while.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said Mr. Patten, "I shall be most happy to do anything I can
  for you, Sir John."</p>

  <p>"Of course," the other went on with a smile, "I suppose we could have
  managed it, but I do not like amateur theatricals, anyway, and amateur
  theatricals which are produced under the direction of an amateur stage
  manager are perhaps the most abominable of all forms which amateurism in art
  can take."</p>

  <p>"You have your cast arranged, I suppose?" asked the young manager with
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Pretty well," said Sir John; "the only doubt I have in my mind is a small
  part which my daughter tells me she will probably get a lady of her
  acquaintance to take."</p>

  <p>Mr. Patten nodded.</p>

  <p>"There will be no difficulty at all," he said; "though perhaps it would
  have been better had you chosen a less amateur piece than 'The Admirable
  Crichton.'"</p>

  <p>Sir John shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"What will you?" he said. "I am the merest pawn, my daughter is rather
  keen on playing the part of a lady who wears breeches&mdash;a deplorable
  ambition," he smiled; "but since she has produced the dramatic club out of
  nothing, I do not doubt it will show the character in a new light."</p>

  <p>He rose and offered his hand.</p>

  <p>"In the event of my daughter not being able to secure the lady she wants,
  I suppose you could let me have one of your people to take the part?"</p>

  <p>Augustus thought for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I could get a girl from the town," he said, "who would be, I am sure,
  excellent for the part."</p>

  <p>"An amateur?"</p>

  <p>Augustus nodded.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he said apologetically. "I do not know whether you want to
  have a townsman's daughter in it."</p>

  <p>"I do not mind a bit," smiled Sir John. "Is she pretty?"</p>

  <p>"She is very pretty," said Augustus enthusiastically; "one of the
  prettiest girls I have seen for a long time, though," he smiled, "she is not
  comparable to other types you may be aware of."</p>

  <p>"Neatly saved," approved Sir John. "I am greatly obliged to you," he said
  at parting.</p>

  <p>Augustus Patten saw him into his car, and he came back thoughtfully to the
  auditorium.</p>

  <p>Patten was a remarkable recruit to the theatrical world. He was a man of
  good birth, and related to one of the oldest families in Spain.</p>

  <p>He had many qualities which did not exactly endear him to the people of
  Bulboro'. His enthusiasm was apt to run away with him; he was inclined to an
  extravagance of promise and a certain remissness of fulfilment, which never
  makes for popularity. He was a man of violent tempers, violent prejudices and
  violent friendships.</p>

  <p>There was, in fact, in his character a certain instability which was due
  rather to the Latin in him and to his youthfulness. He was hasty, easily
  influenced to a point, but those who turned the tender twigs of the moment,
  and went away satisfied that the tree would incline that way, generally
  returned to a grievous disillusionment. He was perhaps unique amongst his
  class, in that no breath of scandal had ever been associated with his name It
  was a fact that girls employed in his theatre were exposed to a minimum of
  temptation. A stage manager who allowed an intruder behind the scenes during
  a performance, or during the time that the performers were in the building,
  would find short shift. Patten kept his theatre clean, and was familiar
  neither in attitude nor speech to any of the ladies who earned their living
  upon the boards of his stage.</p>

  <p>It was this fact, perhaps, which influenced the county to take him to
  their arms, for despite his good birth, his perfect address and his polish,
  they would never accept in a man who was outside their set any of the
  eccentricities which they tolerated amongst people in their own circles.</p>

  <p>He sat in the middle of the stalls; the stage was cleared for a rehearsal,
  and a group of men and women stood about waiting for the word to
  commence.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said, and for the next two hours he sat offering criticism of
  voice and gesture to a large number of people, who, however much they might
  differ amongst themselves as to the method in which a part should be read,
  were unanimous in their view that the young man, who sat in state in the
  stalls, knew less about the subject than anybody.</p>

  <p>Sir John had one or two calls to make before he returned to his house. He
  called in at the County Club and found two or three letters awaiting him, met
  an acquaintance or two as he strolled down the Chad, idly examined the new
  stock of Bulboro's leading jeweller. He stood for a moment speaking with his
  bailiff, whom he met at the end of the Chad.</p>

  <p>It was an unexpected apparition to the bailiff.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to see you, Sir John," he said, raising his hat; "you are
  looking very well, sir."</p>

  <p>"I am feeling very well, too, Martin," said Sir John. "I have just
  returned from a hunting trip in the Rocky Mountains. What is there stirring
  in Bulboro'?"</p>

  <p>The bailiff smiled, and replied according to the formula of small towns
  that nothing ever happened in Bulboro'. He then went on to relate quite a
  number of things that had.</p>

  <p>"I have heard most of that," said Sir John. "What sort of a man is the
  doctor? I am rather curious to see him."</p>

  <p>"There he is now, sir, getting out of his car."</p>

  <p>He pointed across the road to where Anthony was alighting before his
  office.</p>

  <p>"So that is he, is it?" asked Sir John, good-naturedly. "I will go along
  and talk to him"</p>

  <p>He wanted to meet the nephew of old Jabez Manton, but more especially did
  he wish to see what manner of man it was who had dared to rebuke his
  daughter. He chuckled to himself. Jerry told him everything, suppressing,
  perhaps with some excuse, too vivid an account of her own provocative action,
  and Sir John had been amused.</p>

  <p>He knew, none better, that Jerry could be a trial. She stood in awe of him
  and had never exercised any of her caprices to his discomfort, for he had
  been an interested spectator and an amused one on many occasions when Jerry's
  insolence had had full scope.</p>

  <p>Anthony was delayed whilst he was giving the chauffeur directions. He had
  to see Pastor Childe, who had sent for him twice to discuss the question "of
  the unfortunate man Gill". To this Anthony had sent a politely-worded
  refusal. Now had come a more urgent message. Mr. Childe was unwell and
  Anthony, remembering a certain warning regarding gastric trouble, was obeying
  the summons, albeit with suspicion.</p>

  <p>Sir John was enabled to overtake him before he reached the door of his
  office.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me one moment, doctor," he said, and as Anthony turned round:</p>

  <p>"I am Sir John Brand; you have probably heard of me. I was an old friend
  of your uncle's."</p>

  <p>"I am delighted to meet you," said Anthony, realizing that this was the
  father of a lady with whom he had had a passage at arms. "Come along up to
  the office, will you, for a moment."</p>

  <p>"I shall not keep you," said Sir John, as he was ushered into the bare
  room which served Anthony in his capacity of consultant. "To tell you the
  truth," he laughed, "I wanted to make a very close inspection of the
  gentleman who ragged my Jerry."</p>

  <p>"I did not exactly rag her, did I?" said Anthony, a little
  embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"I hope you did," said Sir John. "She is inclined to be a little on the
  commanding side, and a wholesome lesson will do her no harm at all. In fact,"
  he suggested amiably, "you might reasonably include that little incident in
  your bill, for it is distinctly the kind of medical treatment that Jerry
  requires."</p>

  <p>"I shall not do that," smiled Anthony.</p>

  <p>He knew his visitor by repute. He was the type of man who was very
  pleasant to meet; indeed, there were many who forgave Sir John his sins on no
  higher or more moral grounds than his geniality.</p>

  <p>"I should like you to come up to dinner one night," he went on. "You need
  not be apprehensive; Jerry will be quite tame, and there will be a lot of
  young men who will fight for the privilege of enduring Jerry's
  insolence."</p>

  <p>"I shall be a non-combatant," said Anthony.</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant little visit, marked by extreme frankness and kindliness
  on the part of Sir John Brand, and by a sense of gratitude on the part of the
  younger man. It always pleased him when older men than himself, and worldly
  men at that, met him on common ground.</p>

  <p>"I have invited your doctor to dinner," said Sir John, as he settled
  himself down to lunch.</p>

  <p>"Oh, daddy, you haven't," protested the girl.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I have," said her father, "but he is coming to see me, so you
  need not be very worried."</p>

  <p>"I shan't have to speak to him, of course," she smiled.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said Sir John, "since he is a guest in my house, and you will
  be his lady hostess."</p>

  <p>"Don't be horrid, papa," she smiled, in spite of herself; "but he is
  really a terrible young man."</p>

  <p>Sir John looked at her, a twinkle in his eye.</p>

  <p>"Now do you know," he said combatively, "I thought he was rather a
  pleasant cove."</p>

  <p>The girl put up her hands to her ears in mock horror.</p>

  <p>"Daddy, these 'coves' of yours: Are they the product of the Rocky
  Mountains? The last time you came back from China it was 'feller.'"</p>

  <p>"I rather like 'coves,'" mused Sir John; "it is so expressive. By the way,
  are you engaged, by any chance?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"When?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I mean are you engaged to be married?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not," she said indignantly; "you do not suppose I should do
  such a thing without letting you know."</p>

  <p>"I am blessed if I know," said Sir John, as he reached for the celery;
  "girls do such curious things without consulting their parents."</p>

  <p>"Has that been your experience, daddy?" she asked innocently.</p>

  <p>He shot a glance at her. She had reached the age when she might examine an
  uncensored <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>

  <p>"That has been my experience, Jerry," he said.</p>

  <p>They were good comrades, this father and daughter. How much she knew and
  how much she guessed he never troubled to discover. It pleased him to believe
  that she knew a little, and placed the most charitable construction upon
  that.</p>

  <p>"And how is Beatrice?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The girl frowned.</p>

  <p>"Not particularly bright to-day," she said. "She is changed in some
  extraordinary way which I cannot quite understand. Daddy, do you know
  anything about Beatrice?"</p>

  <p>"Do I know anything about her?" he repeated, as she paused irresolutely.
  "I know she is an admirable lady who respects her husband."</p>

  <p>"But does she?" asked the girl quietly. "I have often
  wondered&mdash;Edward is very trying."</p>

  <p>"I think Edward is an ass," said Sir John. After lunch he returned to the
  question.</p>

  <p>"What did you mean when you asked whether I knew anything about
  Beatrice?"</p>

  <p>"I mean, has she a past?"</p>

  <p>He looked out of the window.</p>

  <p>"We have all got 'pasts'," he said, when at length he broke the
  silence.</p>

  <p>"Do not be trite, daddy," she said with a smile. "Has she anything in her
  life that ought to worry her?"</p>

  <p>"I am blest if I know," said Sir John. "As far as I am concerned, I never
  remember the sins or follies of my fellows, though they have an unpleasant
  trick of remembering mine. By the way, I have had a letter from Bexley. What
  a devil of a chap he is for writing letters," he said a little irritably.</p>

  <p>"What does he want?" she asked. She had an interest in Bexley.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what he wants except my general reformation, placing my
  house in order and adopting a method of life and a standard of decorum more
  suitable to my years and more in keeping with my position as a prospective
  father-in-law to a young Cabinet Minister."</p>

  <p>"Did he say that?" asked the girl, aghast.</p>

  <p>"He did not say that exactly," corrected her father with a smile; "but
  that was the general trend of the letter."</p>

  <p>"What impertinence!" she said angrily.</p>

  <p>"Don't get wild with the young man," said Sir John, "he is not a bad
  fellow, Jerry; you might do worse. He is a prig, but then all young
  politicians are prigs. There must be something in a youngster who has become
  a Minister of Education at the age of goodness knows what."</p>

  <p>"Thirty-one," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Is he as old as that? How time flies! It doesn't seem more than the other
  day when he used to fall off his horse every time he followed hounds, and
  howl his ugly little head off with sheer funk at the sight of an open
  ditch."</p>

  <p>He went back to the dangerous ground of Beatrice.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the girl in answer to a question; "she is quieter, I think,
  less inclined to snap at poor Edward. I have thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" he asked as she paused.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea that she is getting religious."</p>

  <p>"Oh, rot!" said Sir John. "The Rector's wife getting religious! More
  likely it is indigestion."</p>

  <p>"I think you are very unkind, daddy."</p>

  <p>"Indeed I am not," he said, as he nipped off the end of his cigar with the
  cutters he had taken from his waistcoat pocket. "Your suggestion was that she
  was getting religious in the Nonconformist sense. We are all
  religious&mdash;I am religious&mdash;I am one of the most God-fearing men in
  Bulboro' in a proper established sense. You do not mean she is getting
  Nonconformally religious?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The girl nodded her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether I am betraying a confidence," she said, "but some
  time ago she asked me if it was not remarkable that somebody was trying to
  turn her to Nonconformity."</p>

  <p>"Somebody has been trying?" asked her astonished father.</p>

  <p>"Apparently," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"But what does she do? Does she go to chapel secretly, or go veiled and
  masked to Baptist Bible meetings?"</p>

  <p>The girl smiled. The picture was irresistibly funny to her.</p>

  <p>"No, but she walks softly, that is all I can say."</p>

  <p>She found a difficulty in putting her thoughts and her impressions into
  words.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, she will recover from that."</p>

  <p>Sir John dismissed the matter lightly.</p>

  <p>He found a ready solution to all problems except those which directly
  affected him.</p>

  <p>The solution was that everything was for the best, and that these matters
  had a trick of self-adjustment.</p>

  <p>"What am I to do?" she asked, later in the afternoon, "when Dr. Manton
  comes?"</p>

  <p>"You are to do as any other lady would do," said her father sharply; "you
  are to treat him as though he were your best friend; you yourself were
  responsible for that scene. You are a spoilt baby, Jerry, but you must not
  allow your prejudices or your self-importance to embarrass me."</p>

  <p>It was very seldom that he spoke to her like this, but when he did it was
  effective.</p>

  <p>"Very good, daddy," she said meekly.</p>

  <p>She had a wholesome fear of no more than such a speech. It represented the
  extreme of his reproof and disapproval. Nevertheless, it did not soften her
  heart towards Dr. Manton, and standing before her glass that night as she
  dressed for dinner, she shook her tiny fist in the direction of Pilgrim's
  Rest.</p>

  <p>"You wait," said she, "I will be even with you, you horrid, bad-tempered,
  uncivilized devil!"</p>

  <p>Yes, she called him a devil in the privacy of her own room; it was a
  relaxation which she occasionally allowed herself in moments of extreme
  emotion.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7">VII. &mdash; BULBORO' POLITICS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">That morning Anthony kept an appointment which he had made
  with the Rev. Horace Childe, or, as some preferred to call him, Pastor
  Childe. A note brought to Anthony's house had displayed some urgency, but
  urgent as the message had been, the patient was by no means in the condition
  which the letter had suggested.</p>

  <p>Anthony found him in the study, a big room overlooking a well-tended
  garden. Its walls were lined with book-shelves, the carpet was comfortable
  and warm, and the big table which occupied the centre of the room was adorned
  by a bust of Knox. The room was evidently comfortable.</p>

  <p>The Pastor sat in a big chair before a blazing fire. His large figure was
  wrapped in a padded dressing-gown.</p>

  <p>He was a big-faced man of a fleshy type, baldheaded, with a little fringe
  of black curly hair falling over his collar. His voice was one of those
  pleasant sopranos which are found in men. Usually a cheery and valiant
  soul&mdash;did he not serve a month in Bulboro' gaol rather than pay taxes
  which were levied at his conscience?&mdash;he was now depressed and wretched.
  There was an unhealthy pallor on his face, and his eyes were yellow and
  bilious.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you have come, doctor," he said weakly.</p>

  <p>Anthony Manton had discovered during his short practice in Bulboro' that
  patients were never afterwards quite so ill as they were the moment the
  doctor arrived.</p>

  <p>It seemed that they must adopt a certain air, a certain attitude, even a
  certain intonation of voice, to justify their action in sending for a doctor
  at all, and this was particularly noticeable in the men; so that the weakness
  of voice and limpness of handshake in which Childe met him was not greatly
  alarming.</p>

  <p>"I am awfully ill, doctor," said the Pastor. "Won't you sit down? I am
  expecting some friends here this morning, and if you do not mind, I would
  like you to meet them."</p>

  <p>Anthony, who had not come to make a social call, busied himself with the
  questions which were peculiar to his profession, and after five minutes'
  probing, the application of a stethoscope to the Pastor's chest and back, a
  judicious series of double knocks over the apex and the lungs, and a brief
  examination of the eyes, Anthony prescribed.</p>

  <p>"You have some gastric trouble, have you not?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I think my heart is out of order," said Pastor Childe sadly.</p>

  <p>"I would not say that it was your heart, though undoubtedly there is some
  trouble there," said Anthony.</p>

  <p>His words seemed to galvanize the Pastor to life, and he sat bolt
  upright.</p>

  <p>"You do not mean that?" he said incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do," said Anthony, with a smile. "You are not surprised, are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Your uncle said my heart was all right."</p>

  <p>"Ah, it probably was when he examined it," said Anthony; "but hearts
  change and deteriorate, you know, from day to day and from month to month. My
  uncle may not have heard the mitral murmur, but I can hear it now quite
  plainly."</p>

  <p>"You do not mean I have heart disease?"</p>

  <p>"I do not think it is anything to worry about," said Anthony reassuringly;
  "but you have undoubtedly some heart trouble. Why, if I made an examination
  half the people in Bulboro' would learn the same to their astonishment."</p>

  <p>The news had evidently made a profound impression upon the Pastor.</p>

  <p>"How long do you think I have to live?" he asked a little shakily.</p>

  <p>"About twenty-five or thirty fully. I do not think I should let the
  question of immediate danger bother you very much."</p>

  <p>It was at that moment when the friends of Pastor Childe arrived.</p>

  <p>Anthony was a little annoyed. He had no desire to meet an ecclesiastical
  deputation, but since he had to meet these people, and since they represented
  in each case the heads of distinct communities, members of which were counted
  amongst his patients, he put on as good a face as he could, and turned to the
  ministers who came into the study.</p>

  <p>"I thought it a good opportunity that you should know our friends," said
  the Pastor. "Although we are of different denominations, it is fitting that
  at the bedside of one which is grievously afflicted, is sick almost to death,
  we should meet, in all kindliness, and discuss matters free from rancour, and
  under God's guidance reach a solution of a very difficult situation."</p>

  <p>This was news to Anthony.</p>

  <p>He was introduced one by one. There was Stope, the young politician who
  ministered to the spiritual needs of the Congregationalists, a man fluent of
  speech, vital in his every utterance and in his every action.</p>

  <p>There was Mr. Haverstock, a small man, very bald, with an attenuated beard
  and a smiling eye. This was the Wesleyan, an excellent and kindly man, too
  absorbed in his studies to be over-popular with his exigent congregation.
  There was Mr. Mabson, the leader of the "Bulboro' Brotherhood", a young man
  who wore a white tie for no special reason unless it be to attest the purity
  of his motive; and last, but not least, Mr. Tanberry, with his fiery red
  beard.</p>

  <p>"This represents only a section of Nonconformist thought in this town,
  doctor."</p>

  <p>The figure in the dressing-gown beside the fire seemed to have shaken off
  all the appearance and symptoms of disease, and was now a healthy and
  vigorous master of ceremonies, and well enough clothed with the dignity of
  his self-appointed office to over-ride the incongruity of his costume.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know"&mdash;he cleared his throat&mdash;"that we have been
  very grievously wounded and very grievously injured by the persecution of our
  brother Gill?"</p>

  <p>"I think his son was also grievously injured," said Anthony. He stood
  combatively before the fire, his hands behind him, all his intellectual
  bristles pointing outward. "Is there no section of religious thought to
  represent the feelings of a human being who has been lacerated, less by the
  thought of prosecution than by the actual application of an ash stick? For if
  there is," he said, "and if there is any means of getting him here, I should
  like to wait until he arrives."</p>

  <p>"That is not the spirit in which we want to be met, Dr. Manton." It was
  the suave and smiling Mr. Stope, with his ready speech and his quick grasp of
  debate, who spoke. "The desire of all our brethren is to clear up a situation
  which reflects upon an earnest worker, not of my own congregation"&mdash;he
  spread out his hands to disclaim any self-interest&mdash;"but of one which is
  labouring to the same end, and with the same glorious object."</p>

  <p>"Amen," said Pastor Childe, and it was repeated by all except Mr.
  Haverstock, who at that precise moment, with his eyes fixed upon the fire,
  was speculating as to the possibility which had been advanced in the
  <i>Wesleyan Monthly</i> that very morning as to whether Ezekiel's dream
  temple had ever been built.</p>

  <p>"I do not know that I can do anything," said Anthony Manton.</p>

  <p>If he spoke irritably it was with the knowledge that only a few days
  previously another deputation had called upon him to invite him to assist on
  behalf of a stage-struck girl.</p>

  <p>Why did they come to him? he asked himself resentfully.</p>

  <p>"You can help in this manner," said Pastor Childe. "I am sure all our
  brethren are in agreement that you can assist very materially by
  re-establishing this unfortunate man, who tomorrow will be released from a
  cold prison cell, and from the bondage into which your persecution condemned
  him."</p>

  <p>Anthony put his head on one side and looked down at the other.</p>

  <p>"If you use that word 'persecution' again, Mr. Childe, I shall go."</p>

  <p>"I think our friend is right," said Mr. Stope. "We do not want polemic
  phrase, let us stick to the facts. There is no doubt at all, brother," he
  addressed Childe, "that our friend Gill, who is as much my friend as he is
  yours, did, in his righteous wrath, overstep the bounds. Probably he was
  carried away with zeal for an ideal, and he may possibly have injured the boy
  much more than he imagined. I think, too, that the doctor may have acted well
  within his legal rights. Now let us come to the really serious business of
  this gathering," he said. "Doctor Manton, you are aware that your right or
  wrong, has excited a vast amount of resentment in the bosoms of brethren
  associated with us in our work?"</p>

  <p>"I imagined it had excited resentment only in the bosoms of those who
  could condone so vicious an assault upon a child," said Anthony sternly. "I
  do not understand the attitude of mind of any person or of any congregation
  which can take sides or can exhibit partisanship on a question of common
  humanity. Whatever you want me to do," he went on, "that may rehabilitate
  this man in the public esteem, you may be sure I shall not do. Let me
  finish," he said roughly, for Mr. Stope, with a smile, would have stopped
  him. "There is a law in this land which takes no cognizance of the position a
  man may occupy in society if that law is violated; that, I think, is clear.
  Behind the law there is a public opinion, evenly and uniformly adjusted to
  the standard of legal enactment. The law and righteous public opinion are
  one. I stand on that. I stand not only upon the law which condemned this man,
  but upon the view of all communities of civilized beings to justify any
  action I took, or shall take, in this matter of the boy Gill."</p>

  <p>"But we think, doctor," said Mr. Stope, "that this is all a storm in a
  teacup, really not worth making a great deal of fuss about, and we feel, too,
  that if you could give a public expression to the effect that you had acted
  in haste or that you, let us say"&mdash;he shrugged his
  shoulders&mdash;"regretted to some extent the action you had taken, why, that
  would be sufficient to settle the whole matter."</p>

  <p>"It might be sufficient for you," said Anthony, "but it would not be
  sufficient for me. Why should I perjure my soul to re-establish your friend
  in the eyes of the world? What other justification does he need than that of
  the approval of his fellows? If your friends elect for martyrdom, for
  heaven's sake let them endure the martyrdom. I do not remember that any of
  the illustrious men who suffered for their faith clamoured for public
  approval. Your man is but a vulgar neurotic. Worse than that, he is a vicious
  unbalanced degenerate. What need has he of my word?</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, I think I have a grievance against you all," he continued. "I
  have been brought here because I have refused three times to be interviewed
  on this very question, and I have been brought here by a trick."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Manton!" expostulated the outraged Mr. Childe.</p>

  <p>"By a trick," repeated Anthony firmly. "And I assure you that the view I
  now hold I shall hold for all time. I wish you a very good morning, and may I
  suggest, Mr. Childe, that you find another medical practitioner to attend to
  you."</p>

  <p>He was very angry indeed.</p>

  <p>It was absurd, he thought, as he jumped into his car and was driven up
  West Hill, to lose one's temper with these people. He was the more angry that
  he had been betrayed into an evident loss of patience.</p>

  <p>"You have got to keep a hold on your tongue," he said to himself; "this
  will not do at all, you are allowing these little snipe to rattle
  you&mdash;and big snipe, too !"</p>

  <p>He smiled as he thought of the forthcoming dinner, and possibly Geraldine
  Brand would not have reflected his smile had she heard herself compared to
  that interesting bird.</p>

  <p>He reached home to find Ambrose Cohen waiting, and remembered that he had
  invited him to lunch.</p>

  <p>"I owe you an apology," he said, as he looked at the clock. "I have kept
  you waiting."</p>

  <p>"Not at all." The little man had ensconced himself in a big arm-chair in
  Anthony's study, and with his pince-nez perched on the end of his nose, was
  engaged in a recreation to which, he confessed, he found no
  parallel&mdash;the study of <i>The Times</i>.</p>

  <p>He was a keen politician without being violently so, and had a thorough
  knowledge of foreign politics and their relation to the money market. This
  was an attainment which was largely responsible for his wealth, for,
  curiously enough, much of his money had been made in England.</p>

  <p>"Well, how do you find all your good people?" he asked. He put down the
  paper and folded his glasses.</p>

  <p>"I find them very trying," said Anthony.</p>

  <p>"You are too aware of them," responded Mr. Cohen.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand you," said the other with a little laugh.</p>

  <p>"I mean," explained Cohen, "you are too conscious of their existence, that
  they are surrounding you, and that they are thinking human beings with their
  minds probably occupied to your detriment. If you think this, why, you will
  be unhappy all the time. I have come to a place now," he said, "where I
  regard the rest of humanity as so many inanimate pieces of wood. It is an
  encouraging thought that all the rest of the world is wooden, and you are the
  only human thing alive. It gives one a sense of power which one can secure by
  no process of thought unless one is enormously rich and enormously healthy.
  Anyway," he concluded, "there are not sufficient grounds for irritation in
  Bulboro'. Bulboro' is so inevitable!"</p>

  <p>Anthony nodded.</p>

  <p>It was indeed, he thought, appointed from the beginning of time, ordered
  since the beginning of the world. That was the impression he had. He saw
  life, politics, commerce, even so butterfly a quality as society, passing
  along set grooves, moving over definitely bounded ways, and obeying
  absolutely ordained and settled laws.</p>

  <p>It was not that there were no new paths which might be laid for the myriad
  feet to tread; only there was no place for the new paths to go. Innovation of
  thought and action were checked by old rights-of-way, old institutions deeply
  embedded; old and ancient foundations that went deep down out of sight; old
  antagonisms, too, that reached back through the centuries before you
  discovered their origin. Bulboro' had traditions which were founded, so an
  antiquarian had discovered, upon certain differences of opinion that led to
  the civil war between Charles and his Parliament. In politics Bulboro' was
  Radical and had always been Radical. Now, however, there seemed a chance that
  its politics might change. Not that any one man in Bulboro' who held an
  opinion was likely to revoke his views. But rather because a large woollen
  factory, which directly employed two thousand people and gave indirect
  livelihood to half as many again, had closed down, owing, as some would say,
  to a wholly vexatious strike, one of the many exciting periods through which
  Bulboro' had passed.</p>

  <p>They (the gossips of the town, the know-alls who told their stories at the
  street corner or before the club fire with equally small foundation) said
  that Rigley, the young managing director of the company, had transferred the
  Bulboro' branch to Yorkshire out of sheer malice; that his looms were old,
  and that his business had sufficient reserve of capital to lay down new
  machinery, and it needed only the strike to decide the firm on consolidating
  its interests, and in bringing together its Yorkshire and its Bulboro'
  branches for economic working.</p>

  <p>There is no doubt that the gossips spoke half the truth. The managing
  director had some malicious desire to punish the people who had supported the
  strikers and who had made life intolerable for him and for his family during
  the five weeks the dispute had lasted.</p>

  <p>Be that as it may, the factory closed, and, of a sudden, support was
  withdrawn from three thousand people. It was a very serious matter for
  Bulboro'. It did not affect the churches; strangely enough, factory workers
  were notoriously ungodly. It half ruined a number of licensed victuallers,
  wholly ruined a pathetic number of small tradesmen, but most disastrous was
  the sequel to the agent of the Liberal party, for the wool workers had been
  Radical or Socialist almost to a man.</p>

  <p>This brief history Ambrose Cohen sketched.</p>

  <p>"I suppose a Conservative will get in this time," he said.</p>

  <p>"Who is the Liberal candidate?" asked Anthony.</p>

  <p>"Stope," said the other with a smile. "He is the best man they could get.
  He has the whole weight of Nonconformity behind him, and the people who have
  never voted before will vote this time. He is an excellent speaker, too."</p>

  <p>"What sort of a preacher is he?" asked the other. Mr. Cohen smiled.</p>

  <p>"It is against my religious principles to attend places of Christian
  worship," he said, "but I am told he is a most eloquent man He is plausible,
  anyway. He will carry a solid vote, and it will be a near thing."</p>

  <p>"Who is the Conservative?" asked Anthony.</p>

  <p>Cohen shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There is no Conservative at present," he said. "Why don't you stand?"</p>

  <p>Anthony smiled largely.</p>

  <p>"You are a humorist, Mr. Cohen," he said.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8">VIII. &mdash; TONY BECOMES UNPOPULAR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">John Gill came out of prison on a Monday morning, and he may
  have anticipated a reception something on the lines of that which had greeted
  his beloved Pastor. But even the partisanship of Bulboro' did not go so far
  as to lionize a man who had been convicted of a crime, the punishment for
  which could, by no stretch of imagination, be construed into martyrdom.</p>

  <p>He found his wife weeping, or ready to weep, and Pastor Childe was
  chilly.</p>

  <p>There were one or two curious people who had stopped on their way past the
  grim gates of the jail to watch the prisoners discharged, but there was
  nothing in the nature of such a welcome as Mr. John Gill, in the silence and
  the solitude of his cell, had pictured. He had long since forgotten the crime
  for which he was convicted, and he was oppressed only by a sense of his own
  sufferings, sufferings which had been brought about indirectly as a result of
  his endeavour to lead a young life from the temptations which lay waiting to
  trip him up. This was the crime for which Mr. John Gill was punished&mdash;it
  was his view at any rate.</p>

  <p>More intelligent men have skipped the intermediate stages of cause and
  result when the conclusion has been to their credit.</p>

  <p>He came out through the little wicket-gate and kissed his wife coldly,
  shook hands with the Pastor; but there was no smile on his pale face in
  response to that which his chief accorded him.</p>

  <p>"And this is the welcome I receive?" were his first words.</p>

  <p>Pastor Childe, who knew the variety of mind the man possessed, perhaps
  better than any other man in Bulboro', was a little astonished, perhaps in
  his secret heart a little amused.</p>

  <p>"My brother," he said gently, "let us rejoice that you are amongst us in
  the fullness of your health&mdash;let us thank God for that."</p>

  <p>"Amen," said John Gill, but without enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>He got into the fly which was waiting, with lagging feet, and came back to
  Bulboro'&mdash;unconscious, uncaring, damned-to-all-eternity Bulboro'&mdash;a
  bitter and a hateful man.</p>

  <p>"What about the doctor?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The Pastor could only express his helplessness with a gesture, but told
  the man of the steps which a number of people were taking to induce Dr.
  Anthony Manton to rehabilitate his "victim" in the eyes of the world.</p>

  <p>"We can only pray for the doctor," said Mr. Childe dryly. Gill did not
  pray.</p>

  <p>Breakfast had been laid in his house, and there he found a fellow-worker
  and a sympathizer in William Tanberry, who greeted him with a great
  heartiness.</p>

  <p>His daughter was there, an anxious girl, her lips aquiver at the sight of
  her father. He gave her a kiss and mumbled a word or two in reply to her
  tearful welcome.</p>

  <p>He looked round the room.</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" he asked.</p>

  <p>There was no need to particularize the "he" he referred to. The Pastor
  patted him on the back encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"Now, now, brother," he said soothingly, "let us begin anew."</p>

  <p>"Where is the boy?" Gill asked again harshly.</p>

  <p>"I have sent him away, dear," said his wife.</p>

  <p>She was a large, stout woman with an impressive and an unemotional
  temperament, given to tears, not without reason, for Mr. Gill, saint though
  he might be in certain environments, preserved many of his admirable
  qualities for the benefit of sinners who were outside his family.</p>

  <p>"You have sent him away; to whom did you send him?"</p>

  <p>"I have sent him to my brother in London."</p>

  <p>"Your brother!" He raised his eyes to the ceiling. "To that loose-liver!
  The responsibility is yours, Maria. However&mdash;" He sat down at the
  table.</p>

  <p>They ate through a painful meal, which was broken only by the solicitudes
  of Tanberry and the Pastor; and such conversation as they could make with no
  more assistance than a monosyllabic reply from their host.</p>

  <p>He ate steadily, with hardly a word. At last he drained his teacup to the
  last drop, put it down deliberately on the table, then he turned to his
  daughter.</p>

  <p>"Mary," he said, "I punished your brother to save his soul, understand
  that."</p>

  <p>"Yes, father," said the girl timidly.</p>

  <p>"I should punish you in exactly the same manner if you followed in his
  steps."</p>

  <p>The girl's mouth moved, but no sound came.</p>

  <p>"As for that doctor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Leave him to God, brother," said the Pastor. "These things are all for a
  wise purpose.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"We cannot see the end, or know<br>
  Which way our Master's objects go;<br>
  We know that we are purged from sin<br>
  The heavenly gates to enter in."</p><br>

  <p>"Let it rest there?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Gill rose.</p>

  <p>"I am a Christian man," he said. "I have served my God faithfully for
  five-and-twenty years."</p>

  <p>At the finish of every sentence he smacked his lips. It was a nervous
  little trick of his. To those who stood in no awe of him it was provocative
  to laughter. To those who hung on his word it had a sinister
  significance.</p>

  <p>"For five-and-twenty years I have served my God," he repeated, "and
  preached Christ crucified, in the public streets in the face of all men. I
  have been hooted and reviled and cursed by sinners and scoffers, but I have
  prevailed by God's help against all the agents of the devil, against all the
  emissaries of hell, and now I feel that Satan, that old one, has set the
  great test of my life. I will overcome it, and overcome him, by God's
  help."</p>

  <p>"Amen," said the two other men.</p>

  <p>The Pastor looked at the man and was unaccountably troubled.</p>

  <p>There was an unearthly glare in his eyes, he was white to the lips.</p>

  <p>"For five-and-twenty years," he said again, "and the devil has baffled me
  and set up against me the strongest of his cohorts. But I will wrestle with
  him, as Jacob wrestled with the angel, and I will cast him down and place
  him, as he placed me, in a prison cell."</p>

  <p>His voice rose louder and louder, and became more and more shrill as he
  stood square to the party, his hands by his sides clenched tight.</p>

  <p>"I think," said the Pastor, after a little pause, "we will have a word of
  prayer."</p>

  <p>The party knelt at their chairs whilst Childe spoke earnestly and
  sincerely&mdash;who shall doubt?&mdash;in the conventional phrases of
  Nonconformity&mdash;he prayed desperately for this man who had come from
  prison, not with the chastened spirit of a penitent offender, not with the
  high courage of the old apostles, but with malice and hatred and uncharity in
  his heart.</p>

  <p>John Gill was by profession a carpenter, and he was employed on the estate
  of Sir John Brand. The estate included a number of the poorer houses in
  Siggley Crescent, and it was part of Gill's business to keep those in repair.
  It was work which offered him a large amount of leisure and paid him
  excellent wages.</p>

  <p>Sir John Brand had no particular views upon religion, except he thought
  that it was a great pity that it was impossible to reorganize the Church
  system, and abolish the bells which woke him every Sunday morning two hours
  before he wished to rise, but he had very definite views upon the duties and
  responsibilities of his servants.</p>

  <p>The day after his release Gill was sent for from the estate office on The
  Chad, and he was shown straight in to Sir John's office, the bailiff being
  the only other man present.</p>

  <p>"You can take a chair, Gill," said Sir John kindly. "I suppose you are a
  little weak after your unpleasant experience."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Sir John," said the other moodily. "I am a little shaken."</p>

  <p>"Now, I hope, Gill, that you are not going to bear malice against my
  friend, Dr. Manton." He emphasized the words "my friend", though he was not
  justified in doing so, but Sir John regarded all men of his class,
  particularly if their interests were threatened by people who were not of his
  class, as having a claim to the title. "I say this," Sir John went on,
  "because they tell me you addressed a large meeting in the Baptist Hall last
  night, and that you made some indirect reference to the doctor."</p>

  <p>"I spoke according to my conscience, Sir John," said the man doggedly, "as
  I was called to speak, so I spoke. God directed my words."</p>

  <p>"That I can understand," said Sir John politely; "only I wish, if you are
  called to speak about the doctor in the future, you will remember that I
  shall be very unhappy if the words put into your mouth are not a little more
  kindly, and, not to put too fine a point upon it, Gill, a little more civil.
  I am not going to bully you," said he, in his genial, hearty way, "because
  you have had your medicine, and I am not entitled to add to your trouble; but
  believe me when I say that in this life, which we have all got to live till
  we get to heaven by various ways, it is better to exercise as many of the
  Christian virtues as one possibly can, and the greatest of these, Gill, as
  you know, is charity. If you are going to act according to your light, you
  have got to forgive any fancied injuries which the doctor did you. You know
  you are told to forgive your enemies."</p>

  <p>"Aye, sir," said Gill, "and we are told to hate the devil and his
  works."</p>

  <p>Sir John laughed, and shrugged his shoulders. "Of course, if you recognize
  the doctor in that capacity, I am perfectly powerless to persuade you. I
  spoke to you as man to man, and now I speak to you as employer to man," he
  said. "You can have what faith you like, do what you like, say what you like,
  convert whom you like, and use what insulting language you may choose about
  the devil or any other individual who annoys you, but I will not have an
  employee of mine stirring up trouble in this town, and advocating what is
  tantamount to a boycott of Dr. Anthony Manton. Is that plain?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, sir," said the other in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"And if you advocate a boycott, or if you start or attempt to foster an
  agitation, having as its object the ruin of a gentleman who did only what I
  should have done, and what any other decent man would have done, I will put
  you off, out of my employment. That is also plain, I think, Gill?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the other.</p>

  <p>"Well, let it go at that. I am sorry to have to speak like this, and you
  must give me credit for having tried to get at the other side of your nature.
  Now, I hope we are going to be all good friends."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand; the man took it reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"I must act according to my conscience, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, damn your conscience!" said Sir John, pardonably exasperated.</p>

  <p>"There he goes," said Sir John a little later, looking through the window
  disgustedly, "full of self-pity and self-admiration. A monument of conceit,
  of super-virtue. What are you going to do with a man like that? He will take
  no more notice of me than if I was a fly on the wall; he will agitate,
  address meetings, bullyrag his wife, and play the devil all round. Oh, these
  Christian communities:" He shook his head, then looked at his watch. "By
  Jove!" he said, "my homily lasted longer than I expected. If my daughter
  calls tell her I am at the theatre."</p>

  <p>"Very good, Sir John," said the bailiff.</p>

  <p>The baronet stepped out across The Chad to the Theatre Royal, whistling a
  little tune, at peace with the world and with the people thereof. The men who
  passed him and raised their hats to him, turned to look after him, so
  cheerful and debonair a soul was he, and some there were who smiled,
  whispered ugly things about his indescribable adventures at home and abroad,
  but none there were who could say that this disreputable baronet of the
  United Kingdom was not a gallant figure of a man, and one for whose lapses
  excuse might not be found.</p>

  <p>"Ah, there you are; I was just coming to see you." He caught Patten's arm
  as the young manager was just turning into the theatre.</p>

  <p>"You will have to find the other girl for me&mdash;my daughter says that
  she cannot get the lady we want; is there any difficulty?"</p>

  <p>He saw the doubt in the young man's face.</p>

  <p>"There is this difficulty," said the young manager, "the girl's father
  hates anything to do with theatricals. She herself is a great artist, I am
  perfectly sure. She came to me one day," he explained, "very timidly, and
  asked if I would hear her recite. I did, and I expected to hear the usual
  'Boy stood on the burning deck' stuff, but I was astounded at her delivery,
  and at her perfect command over expression. Since then I have let her
  rehearse as understudy, although I know I can never put her on."</p>

  <p>"Who is this paragon?" asked Sir John with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Well, between ourselves, Sir John, it is the daughter of the man who came
  out of prison the other day."</p>

  <p>"Not Gill?" asked Sir John in surprise.</p>

  <p>"That is the man," said Patten. He had a habit of putting his hands into
  his two hip pockets when he was perplexed, and now he had adopted this
  attitude.</p>

  <p>"I am perfectly sure she would be fine in any part," he said, with the
  annoyed look of a man who found himself in a quandary. "But I do not think we
  can persuade the father."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said Sir John. "I have just left him; he is one of my workmen,
  and he is a pretty tough nut to crack."</p>

  <p>"Will the account of the theatricals get into the papers?" asked
  Patten.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, no," said Sir John, shocked. "I shall take jolly good care it
  does not; if there is one vice in the world with which I do not wish to be
  associated, it is amateur theatricals. No, so far as I can manage the
  performance it will be very quiet, and the people who come are hardly likely
  to meet Miss Gill. I will ask my daughter to see what she can do to arrange
  things. Anyway, you can tell Miss Gill to hold herself in readiness to come
  up."</p>

  <p>"Is there any excuse we can give her for wanting her?"</p>

  <p>Sir John thought. "Yes," he said, "she can help get things ready. The only
  trouble may be my servants, but I will talk to them."</p>

  <p>On that afternoon a footman came down from High Mount with a note for Mr.
  Gill. Would he allow his daughter to help Miss Geraldine in preparing for a
  forthcoming party and concert at High Mount, "in the cause of charity?" said
  the note cunningly&mdash;Geraldine had underlined the phrase.</p>

  <p>That night Anthony Manton was walking down West Hill after a visit to a
  patient.</p>

  <p>He had dismissed the car, for it was one of those bright, frosty nights
  which invited exercise. He was passing the Church House when he remembered
  that one of his poor patients had invited his offices to persuade the Rector,
  who had some influence with a London hospital, to admit her son. He turned in
  through the big gate to the drive, and was halfway up the avenue when he
  realized that he was disturbing two people who were standing in the shadow of
  a hedge. He caught sight of them against the whitewashed windows of a
  hot-house, when he was some twenty yards from them. It was a man and a woman,
  and at the sound of his steps he saw the woman go swiftly in the shadow of
  the hedge and disappear from view around the corner. He suspected no more
  than a harmless piece of love-making. Possibly one of the Rectory servants
  had stolen out to meet her inamorata, and Anthony smiled as he went on,
  expecting to meet the sheepish-looking young man whom he had disturbed.</p>

  <p>It was a bright, moonlight night, and in the frosty air the light was all
  the brighter. The man came towards him slowly, and with a gasp Anthony
  recognized John Gill. The recognition was mutual; they stood looking at each
  other for the space of a minute. Anthony quickly recovered from his
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Well, Gill," he said, "I hope you are not bearing any of the ill-feeling
  that your speech in the Baptist Hall last night suggests."</p>

  <p>"I leave you to God, sir," said the man harshly. "I have no desire to have
  anything whatever to do with you. You have done your worst, and can do no
  more to me than you have done. I wish you a very good evening."</p>

  <p>Anthony shrugged his shoulders and went on. He could not argue with the
  man, and he dismissed him from his mind. He heard his name called, and the
  swift footsteps of Gill behind him, and turned.</p>

  <p>"I would like to say," said the man, "that whatever you have seen to-night
  is easily explained. I came up to see her ladyship on important
  business."</p>

  <p>"Her ladyship?" repeated Anthony incredulously. "Do you mean to say that
  the lady with whom you were speaking was Lady Heron Wendall?"</p>

  <p>The man saw that he had blundered. He had been honestly anxious, so far as
  his uncomfortable conscience would allow him, to save Lady Heron Wendall the
  embarrassment which he thought might be hers should Anthony subject her to
  such a cross-examination as Gill, from his point of view, felt was
  justified.</p>

  <p>"It was Lady Heron Wendall," he said defiantly, "that is all. I feel in
  justice to her that I should say I was discussing a matter of private
  business, and more," he said exultantly, "I was discussing with her the
  question of her immortal soul, sir. Perhaps that will surprise you. It will
  surprise a good many people in this town," he went on, vigorously, "when that
  lady comes down to our church, and puts aside the pomp and circumstance of
  her quasi-papist faith and worships God, humbly and fervently approaching His
  footstool with a contrite heart." He said no more, but he had said too much
  for Anthony's peace of mind. The doctor continued his way up to the Church
  House, walking slowly, and trying to find an explanation for this
  extraordinary happening.</p>

  <p>What induced this imperious lady to come out into the cold night to meet,
  in a manner which was almost clandestine, this semi-illiterate carpenter with
  his inconsequent jargon? Could there be truth in what the man had said, that
  she was going to leave the Church, and contemplated taking up Evangelism in
  the crudest form? It was absurd.</p>

  <p>Heron Wendall was out, the servant told him; he had gone to London that
  afternoon, but Lady Beatrice was in the drawing-room if he would like to see
  her.</p>

  <p>"It is not necessary," said Anthony. "I will call when the Rector is at
  home."</p>

  <p>He would have gone, but Lady Beatrice came down the stairs to meet
  him.</p>

  <p>"Won't you come in for a little while?" she said. "I am quite alone."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he said, "I am rather busy," but she opened the door of her
  husband's study, and he followed her.</p>

  <p>"Did you see me speaking with that ridiculous man in the drive?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I did not know it was you," Anthony confessed, and she noted the
  embarrassment of the response.</p>

  <p>"He is quite a peculiar person," she said calmly. "By the way, he is the
  man whom you got into trouble; I did not associate the two persons," she
  smiled.</p>

  <p>She changed the subject readily, and asked him if he had been numbered
  amongst the invited guests to the amateur theatricals at High Mount.</p>

  <p>As it happened, an invitation had arrived that day, to his profound
  astonishment He would have been happy to have found an excuse for declining;
  the purely social kind of life did not appeal to him, and he was not
  sufficiently interested in the possibilities which Geraldine Brand and her
  attitude offered, to attend out of sheer curiosity.</p>

  <p>"It will be rather interesting to see what Geraldine does and says," said
  Lady Beatrice with a smile.</p>

  <p>Since that Sunday night in his study, her attitude of mind towards him had
  changed. He was transfigured: a new being had claims to her regard and her
  friendship which no other man in Bulboro' possessed. She had not visited
  Pilgrim's Rest since that night, though the key of the oaken cupboard reposed
  in her purse, and the door of the place was open to her.</p>

  <p>Old Dr. Manton had followed out the traditions of the many builders who
  had contributed to his erratic dwelling by building his study as an annexe to
  the house. It was a one-storied building which flanked itself unobtrusively
  to the shrubbery and commanded along one side a partial view of the house.
  More important to Lady Beatrice Heron Wendall, there was a private entrance
  from the little rose garden.</p>

  <p>Anthony had never used the door with its tiny hallway, and now he saw how
  it might be utilized, and had the locks oiled and the door put in order.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jocks explained his own views on the matter to the admirable Mrs.
  Clements in the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"He is starting the tricks of the old doctor," he said disparagingly. "We
  shall never know when he is in or when he is out. Hullo, wooden head." He
  addressed his remarks to the silent Ahmet, who came in at that moment to
  prepare the coffee. He could be extremely rude to the Moor, for no other
  reason than because Ahmet interpreted all remarks addressed to him in the
  nature of a compliment and with a grin acknowledged the imagined
  demonstration of friendship with his two English words, "Good evening ".</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, Mrs. Clements," said Jocks seriously, "that I shall have to
  hand over my work to another man. This young man is different to the old
  doctor; he is not what I might term so affable."</p>

  <p>"He does not seem to be popular anywhere, Mr. Jocks," said Mrs. Clements
  respectfully. "In the town&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Jocks nodded his head vigorously, and raised his hands, his palms
  outwards.</p>

  <p>"His name positively smells in Bulboro', I tell you it makes me feel so
  awkward. People point me out in the street; they say 'There is Manton's man!'
  I should not be surprised if I was insulted one of these days, Mrs.
  Clements."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I trust not," said the shocked Mrs. Clements.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know that Pennington will not serve us any more with
  milk?"</p>

  <p>"You do not mean that."</p>

  <p>"I do," said Mr. Jocks. "He sent his manager up to see us. You see, when
  you come into Bulboro' you must do as Bulboro' does, as the old saying goes,
  and the doctor has certainly aroused a lot of feeling. I was down at the
  meeting the other night that the Nonconformist chap addressed. I wore my
  oldest suit," said Mr. Jocks inconsequently, "and I do not suppose anybody
  recognized me."</p>

  <p>Mr. Jocks associated Nonconformity with a disagreeable form of unwholesome
  poverty, and, like the good Churchman he was, regarded an excursion into the
  stronghold of the Dissenter as something in the nature of an adventure.</p>

  <p>"He did not half lay it into the governor," said Mr. Jocks, polishing a
  silver spoon with stately strokes, "called him everything he could lay his
  tongue to in a genteel kind of way, quoted Scripture till my head absolutely
  reeled, and I did not know whether I stood on my head or my heels."</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut," said Mrs. Clements in pained surprise. "I do not think they
  ought to do that sort of thing&mdash;quote Scripture at political meetings,
  do you?"</p>

  <p>"All depends upon what political meeting it is," said Mr. Jocks wisely.
  "The names that man called the governor were too awful; Anti-Christ was one
  of them."</p>

  <p>"Anti-Christ," said Mrs. Clements, to whom the phrase was new.</p>

  <p>"Anti-Christ," repeated Mr. Jocks solemnly. "In other words, the devil.
  These were his words, he said there is a man here in Bulboro' who is the
  agent of Satan himself, a persecutor, a perjurer&mdash;oh, Lord," said Mr.
  Jocks in despair, "I wish I could remember all that he said; they all stood
  up at the end&mdash;there were about six hundred of them&mdash;and they all
  repeated a solemn pledge that they would not harbour&mdash;that was the word
  they used&mdash;harbour in their midst a man like the doctor. I heard chaps
  say that they would not send for him if they were dying."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they will change their minds then," said Mrs. Clements hopefully.
  "You do funny things when you are ill. A sister of mine used to think there
  was rabbits walking on the ceiling."</p>

  <p>"That is delirium tremens," said Mr. Jocks definitely, as he made his way
  upstairs in answer to the bell. He was down again, and before Mrs. Clements'
  natural indignation had time to soothe down, before she could refer again to
  the subject, either to attempt to deny or explain, Mr. Jocks returned to the
  subject of Dr. Anthony Manton's enormities.</p>

  <p>"Every time he goes out now he locks the study door, do you know that? The
  old doctor never did it all the time he was here. He told me that if I hear
  anybody inside, I am not to come unless I am sent for. He has given some of
  his friends the key to the outer door to allow them to examine some of his
  curiosities. What do you think of that?"</p>

  <p>"It is strange," said Mrs. Clements.</p>

  <p>Everything was strange to her that happened outside the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"This place is not what it used to be, Mrs. Clements," said Mr. Jocks
  sadly. "There are none of the pickings, the perks, you understand my
  meaning"&mdash;she nodded&mdash;"which came to me in the days of the old
  doctor. Do you think that his clothes will fit me?" He jerked his head in the
  direction of the invisible Anthony with a scornful smile. "Why, it would take
  two of his waistcoats to get round me. Oh, you putty-faced heathen!"</p>

  <p>He addressed Ahmet, who was squatting on the ground humming a most immoral
  song under his breath, and Ahmet looked up with his sweetest smile.</p>

  <p>"Good evening," he said graciously.</p>

  <p>It was a week after this conversation that Anthony Manton was
  irretrievably damned in the eyes of all Bulboro', irrespective of sect.</p>

  <p>However divergent the views of Christian communities might be upon the
  question of ritual or upon the character of service, they were one and all
  combined in the faith that men of colour are in need of salvation. There was
  at that time in Bulboro' a young and enthusiastic lay preacher, a missionary
  who had been invalided home from Dacca, and he had come to the city of the
  saints to recuperate.</p>

  <p>Now, the busman's holiday is not a form of recreation exclusively confined
  to the non-intellectual classes. Your actor, wearied of a long run and
  seeking health in some old-world city, will accept with alacrity, and feel
  slighted if the invitation is not offered to him, the opportunity of
  producing a play for a society of amateur actors. Your journalist desires
  nothing better than to prowl about the office of some country paper, inhaling
  the scent of printer's ink. Your doctor, taking his rest cure, is a pleased
  man if he is called in in consultation. But of all the holiday-makers who
  most reasonably desire to give their friends and admirers some demonstration
  of their quality, there is none to whom the call to work is so urgent as in
  the case of the foreign missionary.</p>

  <p>Mr. Talboy had seen Ahmet on The Chad. Ahmet spent his afternoons, when
  they were sunny, muffled up in a huge overcoat with a tarbosh at the back of
  his head, and his hands thrust into his pockets, wandering up and down the
  shop fronts of The Chad, choosing imaginary presents for his innumerable
  relatives on the Coast. For he was of a roving Moorish family, which a
  century before had distributed itself in large sections in the Kano country,
  and in the various Coast ports where Arab acumen and shrewdness were offered
  scope.</p>

  <p>One day whilst so occupied, Mr. Talboy had seen Ahmet, and had addressed a
  few words in Arabic to the boy, to the latter's great delight. Missionaries
  engaged in their proper work have a fairly extensive vocabulary, so when Mr.
  Talboy met Ahmet again, he spoke with considerable confidence to the Moor,
  and the result of three interviews (one at least carried on before the
  admiring gaze of Mr. Talboy's family and friends in the bow-windowed parlour
  of the respectable Bulboro' villa) was that Ahmet was converted to
  Christianity. No person in the world would have been more surprised than
  Ahmet had this intimation been conveyed to him, for if the truth be told he
  had understood very little of what Mr. Talboy in his fluent way had said, but
  he had agreed with "Yes" and "Praise be to God" and similar phrases which in
  his simple way were equivalent to yes or no, but not quite so definite. He
  had led the missionary to believe that he desired to embrace another faith,
  and here was at once an excellent story for the papers, and a splendid
  testimony to the value of foreign missions.</p>

  <p>There was, as it happened, a great missionary meeting due on the Wednesday
  night, bills announcing this were already posted all over Bulboro'. Nothing
  was easier, however, than to substitute new ones and so from end to end the
  town was plastered with the announcement that there would appear on the
  platform a Mohammedan who had been converted to Christianity in Bulboro'
  itself.</p>

  <p>Bulboro' was intensely interested; so also was Dr. Anthony Manton. He had
  read the intelligence twice before it had flashed upon him that Ahmet was the
  repentant sinner, and he sent for the Arab.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Ahmet," he said, when the man came into his study, "I have read a
  book about you "&mdash;[a book: any written thing in the language of the
  Coast]&mdash;"and it says that you are no longer of the faithful, but you are
  now a Jesu-man."</p>

  <p>"Lord, that is a lie," said Ahmet cheerfully, "for though I respect Jesus,
  as the Koran tells me to do, yet I am of the faith a believer in the one God
  indivisible." He went on to explain. "Lord," said he, "there is a man in this
  town who speaks the Kano tongue like this," and he gave a passable imitation
  of Mr. Talboy's pronunciation, and Anthony smiled, for Arabic is a tricky
  language, "and he spoke with me and he said much that I did not understand.
  Also he spoke certain Jesu words which I did understand, but since your
  Lordship told me that I must at all times be respectful to white men, I said
  nothing. But to-morrow I go with this Jesu-man, and he will take me to a
  place where I shall meet many people," he said proudly.</p>

  <p>"Ahmet," said Anthony impatiently, "I think you are a fool."</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the other man, "it is written that but for fools the world
  would not go round, and, also, lord, if there were no fools in the world to
  speak with, you and I would lose our voices."</p>

  <p>"Get out!" said Anthony.</p>

  <p>He was more annoyed when the <i>Herald</i> appeared with fuller details
  about the convert, and gave as much of his life as Ahmet had been able to
  describe to the enthusiastic Mr. Talboy.</p>

  <p>That he was Anthony Manton's servant added to the piquancy of the
  situation. It was a perfectly ridiculous position, and one in which Anthony
  Manton felt himself rather helpless.</p>

  <p>He had no strong religious feelings, but he had a sufficient desire to
  spare his fellow-Christians the humiliation of making fools of themselves to
  induce him to take strong action.</p>

  <p>All the churches had combined to make this missionary meeting a memorable
  one in the history of Bulboro', which had been announced some weeks
  previously.</p>

  <p>It was always an event of the first importance to all the Christian bodies
  of Bulboro', the one function at which all creeds met upon common ground. The
  fact that the Reverend and Honourable Edward Heron Wendall occupied the
  chair, that the principal speakers included the Reverend Horace Stope and
  Pastor Childe said much for its catholicity. Every section of the town life
  was represented in the great audience which filled the Corn Exchange. All
  society was there, as well as every representative of the democracy, at one
  in their desire to extend the blessing of their faith to Darkest Africa. Mr.
  Talboy, who received an enthusiastic reception as he made his way to the
  crowded platform, had reserved the chair by his side for his convert, and it
  was towards this empty chair that all eyes were directed. Empty it remained,
  for when the Reverend and Honourable Heron Wendall rose amidst the frantic
  applause of those of his own church and the good-natured approval of those
  who did not ordinarily approve, it was still untenanted.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I have a little disappointment for some of you to-night,"
  said the chairman in his most genial manner. He held a letter in his hand.
  "We had expected and hoped to see present amongst us one for whose conversion
  we have all offered thanks It was remarkable that in the missionary movement
  in Bulboro', that here in our midst, we should have had a man, of a faith
  which we regard as pernicious, converted to Christianity, but unfortunately
  our joy was possibly a little premature."</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence whilst he fixed his glasses.</p>

  <p>"This is a letter from Dr. Anthony Manton, the employer of our
  convert."</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Dear Rector</span>," (he read)<br>
  <br>
  "There appears to have been some mistake in regard to my man Ahmet, who is
  being extensively advertised throughout Bulboro' as a convert to the
  Christian faith. The gentleman who was responsible for the conversion, though
  no doubt an excellent Arabic scholar, could not have been aware of the fact
  that Ahmet is Moorish, and his dialect is a little different to that in which
  he was canvassed.<br>
  <br>
  "The long and the short of it is that I have explained exactly what is
  expected of Ahmet, and he is very emphatic in his desire not to change his
  faith. I am afraid this will disappoint a great many people, but I can
  testify that, whether he be Mohammedan or Christian, Ahmet is an honest and
  most loyal man. I am sure you would not care to have him on your platform as
  a convert to Christianity when he has no desire whatever to desert his own
  faith.<br>
  <br>
  &mdash;Yours very truly,<br>
  "<span class="smcap">Anthony Manton</span>."</p><br>

  <p>There was a dead silence following the reading of the letter, broken only
  by one or two spasmodic hisses at the far end of the hall.</p>

  <p>"I am sure, my friends," said the Rector, "you will agree with me that Dr.
  Manton must be the best judge as to his actions. I put the letter before you
  as I have received it, and I offer no comment."</p>

  <p>At which there was some applause. It was gratifying to the reverend and
  honourable gentleman who, having neither condemned nor defended, secured
  credit for both attitudes.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap9"
     name="chap9">IX. &mdash; AN ANONYMOUS LETTER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"You seem to have made yourself particularly popular."</p>

  <p>It was Painter, the maternity man, who offered his smiling comment. They
  were coming away from a consultation together. The young man, whose mind was
  rather upon the case he had just quitted than the effect his letter might
  have produced upon the population of Bulboro', was for the moment
  startled.</p>

  <p>"I see what you mean," he said with a smile. "I do, indeed, seem to be
  particularly unfortunate with these Bulboro' people. I wonder why it is? Do
  you think it is because I have lived so long in the wilderness that I have
  absolutely no social manners left?"</p>

  <p>"I would not like to advance an opinion," said the judicious Painter. "My
  experience of over thirty years in this town is that there are only two
  courses open to a doctor. The one is to obliterate himself except in his
  professional capacity, and the other is to drop all pretence at taking his
  profession seriously, and give his mind and his soul to Bulboro' and its
  pettifogging affairs. You cannot shine in both capacities," he said. "That is
  what it seems you are doing without any intention on your part."</p>

  <p>"The curious thing," said Anthony thoughtfully, "is that my practice is
  not falling off."</p>

  <p>"It will not," said the other promptly. "Don't you know that people love a
  rude doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said the other with a smile.</p>

  <p>"But, honestly," said Painter, in all seriousness, "the more brusque a
  doctor is, the less inclined he is to humour the fads of his patients, the
  more popular he is. Some people do not like it, and-they will give him up and
  get a more genial gentleman to attend to their ailments, but they are sure to
  come back; there is nothing more certain than that. Only," he said
  regretfully, "most of us have not the courage to be offensive, although we
  may know that success lies at the end of it, there is always just a
  possibility that failure lies there too, and it is that little fear which
  keeps us amongst the submerged."</p>

  <p>There was much in what Dr. Painter had said, as Anthony knew. Old General
  Ballington had sent for him and demanded a diagnosis and a treatment, and
  without realizing that he might be in any way offensive, Anthony had
  prescribed a certain temperance diet, to the General's intense
  indignation.</p>

  <p>"I think you drink a little too much," said Anthony, "and you possibly
  take food which is not good for a man of your age."</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean, sir?" demanded the General hotly; "my age; I
  am, comparatively speaking, a young man."</p>

  <p>"As to that," said Anthony dryly, "I cannot say. If one compares you with
  a man of seventy, you are certainly a young man. Still, you are at an age
  when you can take no liberties, and my own impression is that most people who
  have concluded an active life and have no recreations drink far more than is
  good for them. Why not take up golf?"</p>

  <p>"Bah!" snarled the General.</p>

  <p>He wrote an offensive letter covering four pages of blue foolscap, which
  was framed somewhat on the lines of a confidential report to the War Office,
  and this Anthony read with more than ordinary amusement. The sting lay in the
  tail, in which the General requested to be furnished with his account up to
  date, and notified Anthony that he did not require his services any more.</p>

  <p>Anthony sent in his bill, and it was settled on the second day. On the
  seventh an urgent message came down from Lucknow House calling for his
  immediate presence, and he found a very penitent old gentleman in bed, a
  humble old gentleman, an old gentleman who agreed to a noxious form of diet
  and to unthinkable abstention.</p>

  <p>"I hope, doctor, you are not going to take any notice of my foolish
  letter," he said.</p>

  <p>"No," said Anthony cheerily. "It is a testimony to your youthfulness which
  justifies your previous irritation."</p>

  <p>It was not to the good that Anthony had gained a reputation for
  irritability. He was excused by those who would only find an excuse in the
  more offensive sense of the word by his long residence in Central Africa. He
  was the possessor of a liver, ran popular repute; there were some picturesque
  individuals who had seen him writhing in agony as a consequence. He was also
  the possessor of an obscure tropical disease which was the tragedy of his
  life. But the truth about Anthony Manton was, that he was impatient with
  false conditions, with hypocrisies, with the incidents of life as they were
  thrust upon him. He loathed the primness of civilization, the human
  undevelopment he saw around him.</p>

  <p>It made his heart sick to see the children. He saw a race being reared
  with no definite object. They were crammed with information about rivers they
  would never see, and headlands jutting into the distant waters which would
  never send a beam to speed or a quick-flashing ray to welcome them across the
  dark seas. They were parrot-like, inane, vacuous, they knew things which they
  would never know again after their school term was expired. They were brought
  up to know Shakespeare as another form of Geography or as a tedious form of
  History. Shakespeare was an occurrence on a Wednesday afternoon, when their
  little brains must be racked to deliver lines which had no sense or
  significance to them. They were taught by their parents that the Army was a
  sort of workhouse for juveniles, whither it was a disgrace to go. And the
  Navy represented the sea to their minds, the sea to which bad boys are sent
  as an alternative to a reformatory. These slipshod boys hung about the skirts
  of street crowds addressed by frantic and ignorant orators, and they learnt
  to jeer at God as an expression of weak men and sneer at patriotism as a
  party cry. They had neither love of their country nor sense of duty to their
  King. The political activities of the Church body which was nearest to the
  people, had destroyed the Sunday schools. Pleasant Sunday afternoons for men
  and women had taken the place of schools of religious instruction for the
  children. Before every child was a goal. At the age of fourteen by the law of
  the land he might be released with such thin wedges of knowledge as a patient
  teacher had been able to knock into his thick head, and turned joyfully upon
  the world which was mainly populated by carmen who wanted van boys, by
  printers who required lads to bring in men's tea, and by a host of truck
  owners who needed cheap boy labour to deliver their goods.</p>

  <p>Two things they learnt at school and carried away with them: the first was
  to read, and the second was to write. Thus they might read the thousand and
  one books which were provided for the young by numerous houses of publishers.
  It was the blessing of God that the greatest of these houses was directed by
  a man of singular purity of character, and by a large and Imperial vision. He
  dominated the trade and provided exciting romances which were contemptuously
  referred to by supercritical people as penny dreadful. But the literature was
  healthy adventure, healthy melodrama where virtue triumphed, and villainy
  invariably came to grief, and wherein there was no hint or suggestion of the
  everlasting sex problem to taint the mind of the susceptible youth. Largely,
  the tendency of these magazines was for good.</p>

  <p>Not so good perhaps was it for the youth who could read laboriously,
  skipping the long words, when they cultivated a taste for the evening papers,
  and the columns of the Press which were devoted to the day's racing.</p>

  <p>Here was brought into play another science which the boys had carried from
  school. They found their arithmetic, their simple addition at any rate,
  fairly handy, and the knowledge that there were fourteen pounds to a stone
  enabled many a lad of Bulboro' to reckon up the chance of a horse in his
  dinnertime to his immense profit.</p>

  <p>Anthony was appalled by the smug self-satisfaction of these people, doomed
  to be the very stones over which their more intelligent fellows walked. Their
  independence, their boasted democracy, their trembling pride in their rights,
  would have been laughable had it not been so horribly tragic. They were fuel
  ready for burning to be cast by hundreds and by thousands into the pit that
  cunning exploiters would dig. To be pressed and squeezed and burnt, in order
  that intelligence should minister to its own comfort. They were horrible
  waste. The organs which pandered to their vanity, Radical and Unionist alike,
  told them that from their ranks was drawn the men of a thousand battlefields,
  that they were the backbone of the nation. Yet less than one family in a
  hundred contributed one member to the armed forces of the Crown. They hated
  the word "conscription" as they hated the devil; Bulboro' hated discipline.
  To be "ordered about" represented the lowest depths of social degradation to
  which a man might sink. The larger class of Bulboro's population was
  independent of everything in the world, as independent of work as they were
  of Dreadnoughts. They loved to be thought well of by their neighbours.</p>

  <p>Anthony Manton, as has been pointed out, took no part in the active life
  of Bulboro'. He had been unwillingly dragged into the light of publicity by
  an action which he had never for one moment imagined would be denied the
  support and approval of every section of the community. On the night before
  the theatricals, he was more than a little surprised to receive a letter on
  the flap of which was inscribed the title of the <i>Bulboro' Herald</i>. He
  had avoided publicity, and it was with some apprehension that he opened the
  note. It was from the proprietor, Western. It was a brief request for an
  interview on a purely private matter.</p>

  <p>The note was marked urgent, and there was a postscript at the bottom of
  the typewritten request, written in the handwriting of Mr. Gregory Western
  himself:</p>

  <p>"Although it does not directly affect you, I should like to have an
  opportunity of talking with you."</p>

  <p>Anthony gave Jocks instructions to call up the newspaper proprietor and
  fix an appointment for that night after his return from the free
  dispensary.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gregory Western was a man of middle height, clean-shaven, with a
  particularly strong, virile face. He was acknowledged one of the greatest
  powers in Bulboro'. He had a quick, eager, confidential way of speaking, and
  was one of the few men Anthony had met who looked one straight in the eye
  when he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I thought I would see you," he said. "I have had a number of letters
  lately that have been rather uncomplimentary to you, but it is not of that
  that I wish to speak to you. Do you know anything to the detriment of Lady
  Heron Wendall? That is an impertinence," he hastened to add, "but I speak now
  absolutely in confidence. I do not want you to specify anything that you may
  know, but I have had a very specific story sent in to me; I do not know
  whether the sender imagined that I should print it," he smiled, "but it is
  rather an alarming thing to have in hand, and I want, if I possibly can, to
  squash the story, and to find the man who sent it."</p>

  <p>"What is the story?"</p>

  <p>"The story is that Lady Heron Wendall had an affair some fifteen years
  ago, in fact there was rather a scandal and"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"there
  was a child. It is unnecessary for me to say that I expect you to respect my
  confidence just as you may anticipate that I should respect yours."</p>

  <p>"Is that the nature of the communication?" asked Anthony calmly.</p>

  <p>"That is it, specifically stated. The name of the man is given, a man
  named Lefevre."</p>

  <p>"What do they ask you to do, to publish the facts?" Mr. Western
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is sent anonymously, of course; I do not know the handwriting, but if
  it was a lie I could move in the matter; and naturally if there is any
  foundation of truth in it, we do not want to refer to the matter in any way
  whatever."</p>

  <p>It was a delicate position for Anthony, and the only thing to be done was
  to take the obvious course and suggest that Western should call upon Lady
  Heron Wendall herself; but here again there was a difficulty.</p>

  <p>"I think the best thing you can do," he said, "is to wait and see what
  other communications reach you. I can, of course, give you no information on
  the subject, even if I knew, and I cannot recommend you to go to Lady Heron
  Wendall, for obvious reasons. It is pretty beastly. Do you suspect
  anybody?"</p>

  <p>"No, I do not," said Western frankly, "I wonder whether her letter to the
  paper has annoyed somebody."</p>

  <p>"What letter was this? I must say," said Anthony with a quick smile, "that
  I am not a very diligent newspaper reader."</p>

  <p>"Do not apologize," said the editor, "I hold no very strong views on
  people who do not read newspapers. I have the letter here."</p>

  <p>He had a number of papers folded under his arm, and he found a copy of his
  last issue and opened it.</p>

  <p>"There is the letter that Lady Heron Wendall wrote." Anthony bent over and
  read. It was headed:</p>

  <p class="headline">"A DENIAL FROM LADY WENDALL."</p>

  <p>It ran:</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Dear Sir,&mdash;I hear that there are extraordinary
  rumours in Bulboro' to the effect that I am associating myself with the
  Nonconformist movement, more especially in relation to the Street
  League."</p><br>

  <p>"The Street League, as you probably know," explained Mr. Western, in his
  rapid, direct way, "is an association of people who hold services at street
  corners. The rumour was that Lady Heron Wendall was to regularly engage in
  that work."</p>

  <p>Anthony nodded, and continued reading the letter.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"I need hardly say," it went on, "that this is
  absolutely untrue, and whilst I wish every success to the ladies and
  gentlemen who are doing this excellent work, I cannot for many reasons be in
  any way identified with the movement.<br>
  <br>
  "Yours faithfully,<br>
  <br>
  "<span class="smcap">Beatrice Heron Wendall</span>."</p><br>

  <p>"The story came in the day after this was published; she had probably
  annoyed some of these people," said Western.</p>

  <p>"I would like to be informed if any more come. I do not know whether it is
  within my province to ask," Anthony hesitated, "but naturally Lady Wendall is
  a friend of mine, and I should be glad to help discover the rascal who wrote
  the type of letter which you have outlined."</p>

  <p>"You do not want to see it?" asked Mr. Western.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," said Anthony hastily.</p>

  <p>Mr. Western smiled.</p>

  <p>"I presume my junior reporter will include you amongst those present at
  Sir John Brand's amateur theatricals?" he said, and then he frowned. "By
  Jove, I nearly forgot, Sir John does not want it reported; I must remember
  that."</p>

  <p>"I shall be there," said Anthony, "and you, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"All the famous people of Bulboro' will be there," said Mr. Western, with
  a twinkle in his eye. "Between ourselves, I loathe amateur theatricals; they
  alarm me and fill me full of a horrible fear before the curtain goes up, and
  they depress me terribly until the curtain goes down. They call into play all
  the hypocrisy that is within me; one has to have the patience of an angel,
  and the tact of a Machiavelli, to get out of the toils of your amateur play
  producer with any kind of credit. In this case," he said, as he picked up his
  hat to go, "the production will be in the hands of young Patten, so probably
  it will be fairly decent."</p>

  <p>Anthony walked down to the dispensary with him. This free institution,
  founded by his uncle, took a great deal of his time. He loved the work,
  though the ingratitude and the garrulity of his patients were somewhat
  trying. He was learning patience himself now. By sheer training in the
  exercise he was enabled to listen without interruption to the longwinded
  stories that some of his people had to tell him In fact, he was taking, as he
  called it, "a treatment" every day, and rather invited at least one intimate
  recital in the course of every twenty-four hours. The lives of his people
  were so colourless, these people who came flocking to the dispensary to sit
  upon forms, jiggling puny babies and discussing their mutual troubles. They
  had no content and no hope. He realized this more and more, there was
  happiness of a negative order, but no content. They had imagination which
  only pictured unhappy things. That is the great tragedy of the poor, that
  this divine gift of imagination can only be exercised in the anticipation of
  unpleasant consequences to the present.</p>

  <p>Anthony gave freely of his time, and might have been chilled by the
  knowledge that he was not loved by the folk for whom he made his sacrifices.
  It would have been in accordance with all the story-book traditions had he
  been idolized by the poor women he served, but this was not to be. He was
  living amongst real people, dealing with real facts and vital forces. There
  was a murmur which was carried to him that he was too fond of the knife, too
  ready to suggest a little operation where medicine might do. He had his
  bitter disappointments, he lost two or three cases of appendicitis because
  this fear of an operation infinitely less painful than a tooth extraction and
  as innocuous when performed at the proper moment, was responsible for the
  deaths of three children. The parents' point-blank refused to allow him to
  "practise on" their little ones, so one of them told him in as many words. He
  must stand by and see the child die, knowing that the disease had reached a
  point where only the knife could save, and that with little risk to the
  patient. He tried to explain, he even gave a lecture with anatomical
  drawings, but made no converts. "It is hopeless," he told Painter, "they are
  just brutes, with sufficient knowledge to see one side of a ten-sided
  question. If either of those kiddies had been in the Congo I should have put
  it on the table and out would come their little appendices before you could
  say knife."</p>

  <p>"What does it matter?" said Painter wearily, "poor little devils! Three
  little van boys less to be provided for, three little clients for bookmakers
  the less. I tell you, Manton, that with eight out of every ten children I
  bring into the world, I believe I am committing an offence against
  humanity."</p>

  <p>They were strolling across The Chad to the club. In front of the County
  Hall stood a big motor-car which was unfamiliar to Anthony, who by this time
  had got to know the domestic features of Bulboro's more prosperous
  citizens.</p>

  <p>"Whose is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I expect that is Lord Edward Bexley; he is a sort of cousin of Sir
  John Brand."</p>

  <p>"Bexley the Minister?" asked Anthony with a show of interest.</p>

  <p>"That is the chap. Do you know him?"</p>

  <p>"I met him on the Congo," said Anthony, "a rather good fellow and a pretty
  good shot."</p>

  <p>"I suppose he is," said the other grudgingly. "He is a very lucky young
  man. You know he is generally believed to be engaged to Geraldine Brand."</p>

  <p>"Geraldine Brand?" repeated Anthony. For the moment he had forgotten her
  existence.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">X. &mdash; A CLERGYMAN'S LIFE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Rev. Heron Wendall sat at his desk, his hands covering
  the lower part of his face, deep in thought. He picked up the letter again
  and read it, folded it carefully, put it into his pocket, and made his way to
  his wife's room.</p>

  <p>She was expecting him; he had told her that he wanted to see her. She knew
  when he came in that something unusual and something serious had happened. He
  was perturbed, his smile was less prolonged, and his manner a little briefer
  than usual.</p>

  <p>"I have had another letter, Beatrice," he said, as he sat himself at her
  nod.</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it this time?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I am so sorry to bother you," he said courteously, "but it is the same
  miserable old business that we both know about. The sender is probably under
  the impression that I know nothing, and that all he says in his beastly
  letter is news to me."</p>

  <p>"I suppose he mentions the child?" said Lady Beatrice quietly.</p>

  <p>Heron Wendall nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He broke a silence of some minutes' duration by saying:</p>

  <p>"Would it be offensive to you, Beatrice, if I asked you where the child is
  at present?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I do not know; all that I know is that it was handed over to a tenant
  farmer of my father."</p>

  <p>"Not this man?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said in surprise. "What made you think it was he? As a matter of
  fact, it was his brother," she said. "That is how he comes to know of
  it."</p>

  <p>"That is the threat he was holding over your head, that he would
  tell&mdash;who?" asked Heron Wendall.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," she said wearily. "Tell the world, as far as the world is
  interested in these matters."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it would be."</p>

  <p>"I told him that you knew. Of course he did not believe it."</p>

  <p>"Has he asked for money?" the Rector inquired. She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No; only this preposterous idea of my making some sort of open confession
  of my sin, I think."</p>

  <p>He laughed a little harshly.</p>

  <p>"It is difficult to know what men like this want. Their vocabulary is so
  limited, and when those vocabularies are extended at all, they employ such
  extraordinary meaningless phrases."</p>

  <p>"The child was kept by his brother," she went on, "who received a certain
  sum a week from my father's estate. The undertaking was that the child was to
  be brought up as one of the family. How this man comes to know of it I do not
  know, because Henry Gill, the farmer to whom the child went, was a quiet,
  reticent man who was selected by my father for that reason."</p>

  <p>The Rector was silent for a long time</p>

  <p>"What are you thinking?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am wondering, my dear," he said, "to what other person in the town this
  man is sending letters."</p>

  <p>"I have wondered," she said. "It does not matter to me, I am not thinking
  about myself," she went on, "it is you who will be injured, and I wanted to
  save you this because it is cruel."</p>

  <p>"Please do not distress yourself on my account," he said with a smile; "it
  is very unfortunate, that is all. You see it would get to the bishop's ears
  if any more is made of it, and it might possibly affect our future."</p>

  <p>He nearly said "my future," and she supplied the deficiency.</p>

  <p>"It is certain to affect your future if it becomes known," she said, and
  her voice was heavy and expressionless.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if Jerry knows," she asked. She was speaking more to herself. "I
  wonder, if she did, what her attitude would be? Of course, she is young, and
  she would be ready to condone that sort of thing, and think that I was rather
  wonderful to have had such an adventure. Do you know, Edward"&mdash;she
  turned to her husband suddenly with a note which he had never before heard in
  her voice&mdash;"there is an awful lot of truth in the Bible."</p>

  <p>He looked at her, and for once in their married life he smiled as she
  could wish a man to smile, without any movement of the lips, a kindly
  twinkling of his eye, which showed her that somewhere hidden behind that
  pomposity, that veneer of mannerism and the overlaid armour of breed, there
  was a soul in this man.</p>

  <p>"Have you noticed that, too?" he asked quietly. "It is curious how the
  most obvious things are only brought home to one in times like this. I
  sometimes find a lot of pleasure in the Bible," he said simply. "You see the
  whole scheme of things is wrong," he hesitated and withdrew into himself for
  the moment.</p>

  <p>"Go on, Edward," she said. "Tell me, I want to know what you think."</p>

  <p>"You will think I am absurd and banal and all sorts of things, but here am
  I"&mdash;he put out his hands&mdash;"the son of a very poor peer for whom
  this profession was chosen. Beyond my Oxford degrees, a certain desire to
  live quietly and modestly, I had no call to preach the Gospel or to tread in
  the path in which the great saints of all the ages trod, and yet I became a
  preacher and spoke of Christ, and conducted services, and uttered solemn
  admonitions to people who were committing no worse crime than I, save that
  they had not been tainted with the supreme crime of hypocrisy; here am I, one
  of God's mercenaries, an interpreter of a wholly preposterous conception of
  the Almighty&mdash;playing a mechanical game according to conventional
  rules&mdash;I am not being blasphemous."</p>

  <p>"I know what you mean," she said; "just an impersonal x-like thing to be
  spoken of in certain tones, under certain conditions to be invoked in a
  certain form, to be played as an all-conquering card."</p>

  <p>"It is a sort of a game," he said with a puzzled frown; "but recently it
  seems to me that God has become more real and the realization of what is
  Godlike more obvious. God is all that is good in us. I found that out in the
  Bible," he smiled; "touching the Almighty," he quoted, "'we cannot find Him
  out. He is excellent in power and in judgment, and in plenty of justice'. I
  have found that kind of God, and find Him very precious and very
  comforting."</p>

  <p>He walked over to her, and for a moment his hands lay upon her shoulders,
  and the soul of her went out to him as it had never done before in all the
  fifteen years of their marriage.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">XI. &mdash; PRETENCE AND REALITY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"You know Lord Edward Bexley, I suppose?" said
  Geraldine.</p>

  <p>Anthony held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Rather," said Lord Bexley. "We lived together for a month or so, didn't
  we, Manton?"</p>

  <p>He was a good-looking young man, with prominent eyes and inclined to
  fleshiness, and he had all the suavity and good manners of his class.</p>

  <p>"This man is lost here," he said, turning to the girl. "Good Lord, Manton!
  fancy coming away from a place like the Congo where you can shoot elephants,
  or go hunting bugs, according to your particular vanity and inclination, to a
  place like Bulboro'! Don't you feel dead and buried?"</p>

  <p>"There is a great deal here to keep one amused if one can only control
  one's natural irritation," said Anthony.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Manton," said Jerry, shaking her finger solemnly, "I enjoin you to be
  a good Christian, and forgive and forget."</p>

  <p>"I was not thinking of our&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He nearly said "row."</p>

  <p>"What was that?" asked Lord Edward eagerly. "Have you had a row with
  Jerry? How lovely! Who came out best? I saw this man shoot a nigger," he
  said, turning to the girl. "He is a terribly ferocious person."</p>

  <p>The girl frowned at the doctor wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"Did you really?" she asked, in a shocked voice.</p>

  <p>"Not really," smiled Anthony. "I shot at him; but I took particular care
  to miss him. You see we were crossing a large, swampy country, and the
  carriers were inclined to be mutinous. There were only two white men, Lord
  Edward and myself, and matters were looking rather serious, weren't they?" He
  turned for confirmation to the other.</p>

  <p>"They were, indeed," said Lord Edward, nodding his head. "I was in the
  bluest funk I have ever experienced."</p>

  <p>"I just loosed off a revolver at the man," said Anthony. "It shocked the
  carriers to obedience."</p>

  <p>"But do tell me about your row," said Lord Edward.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it was nothing," protested the girl, flushing a little. "I got
  awfully cross at bridge. It was quite unpardonable of me, and the doctor
  behaved very well&mdash;for him," she added, with a smile of gentle
  malice.</p>

  <p>"Has he got a bad reputation?"</p>

  <p>"Horrible," she said solemnly. "Hardly on speaking terms with anybody in
  the town, are you, doctor?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot remember anybody who is really keen on me," said Anthony with a
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"And now it is all over and done with," said the girl briskly; "so do not
  ask a lot of impertinent questions and rake up the grisly past. Dinner will
  be served in five minutes, and I want to ask you men not to linger over it. I
  have particularly requested father to avoid the subject of the promising
  three-year-olds, because the play starts at half-past nine, and one of our
  players must be in her house by eleven."</p>

  <p>"Who is this?" asked Bexley in surprise. "Is there a new early-to-bed
  movement amongst the county families?"</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, she is the daughter of a townsman, and there are lots of reasons why
  we do not want to advertise the fact. Generally it is for her sake, because
  her father is simply a terrible person, as the doctor knows."</p>

  <p>"Gill's daughter," said Anthony in surprise.</p>

  <p>"She is playing a little part, and she plays it jolly well, too. Mr.
  Patten&mdash;here he is to speak for her."</p>

  <p>Patten strolled up at the moment and shook hands with the doctor.</p>

  <p>"I was just telling Dr. Manton about the little actress that you have
  discovered. She is good, isn't she?"</p>

  <p>"Excellent," said the young man. "The doctor knows I am very interested in
  her. We may really have discovered a great artist. But you will see for
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"What does her father say?" asked Anthony in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"He does not know," she said. "We want all account of the play to be kept
  out of the paper. The only danger is that the servants may speak, but father
  has read the riot act to Simmonds, and Simmonds has passed on daddy's awful
  threats to the rest of the household."</p>

  <p>The dinner was a success, so far as Anthony was concerned. He was placed
  next to the girl by Sir John's instructions, it might be noted, and she was
  surprised to discover him not so much the dull scientist, as a very shrewd
  man of the world with views which were well worth listening to, and stories
  which she had not heard before. For this latter she was intensely
  grateful!</p>

  <p>Bexley had a trick of cutting out the gems of last week's humorous papers,
  which in nine cases out of ten had been the choice and amusing jests of the
  Pharaohs.</p>

  <p>Manton was witty, too, in his dry way, but most she was conscious of a
  transparent and convincing honesty. He was younger than any scientist she had
  met, and was less dogmatic. It was an evening of pleasant surprises for her,
  and she found herself wondering what manner of man he would be in his own
  house.</p>

  <p>All the stories she had heard had not been to his credit; she had heard
  them mostly from his household. Mr. Jocks, discreet man as he was, had spoken
  with no particular enthusiasm of his master's domestic qualities, and his
  stories had carried.</p>

  <p>He referred to the amateur theatricals.</p>

  <p>"You must be very kindly and flattering," she warned him, "especially to
  Bexley, who insisted upon taking the part of the fat old uncle. Bex fancies
  himself horribly in these character parts, but my view is that he is rather
  appalling."</p>

  <p>"Oh, rot!" said Bexley across the table. "You have never seen good acting,
  Jerry; you bury yourself in this beastly place, and you have nothing to
  compare me with. There is no sense in drawing comparisons between myself and
  Henry Irving."</p>

  <p>"I quite agree with you," she said.</p>

  <p>"Who is the fat uncle in 'Hamlet'?" asked Anthony, bewildered, and the
  girl smiled.</p>

  <p>"We changed the play," she said simply. "Shakespeare didn't write the part
  of Ophelia to suit me."</p>

  <p>Anthony had had a moment's opportunity for an exchange of words with Lady
  Heron Wendall. She was looking rather tired, he thought, and a little pinched
  of face, but very beautiful, despite these disadvantages.</p>

  <p>Anthony, a privileged person, was allowed to see the "theatre." The big
  ballroom had been converted for this purpose.</p>

  <p>A deep length of stage had been allowed, a perfect proscenium arch had
  been erected, and when half an hour later the curtain rose upon the first act
  of "The Admirable Crichton," the ballroom was comfortably filled by the
  guests who had arrived to augment the dinner-party. The chief interest for
  Anthony lay in watching the girl, Mary Gill. She was cast in the part of one
  of the sisters concerning whose fortune and the admirable valet the play was
  concerned.</p>

  <p>He found himself in agreement with Patten, who sat at his side. There was,
  indeed, the making of a great artist in this girl. Her comedy had that right
  quality of restraint, and such drama as she reflected was true. It was an
  excellent performance from beginning to end. Only two acts of the play were
  given, the first of all being explained on the programme, and when the
  curtain fell upon the Admirable Crichton washing his hands with invisible
  soap before the haughty command of "Follow me" from a man who a few moments
  before had cringed to him, the applause was spontaneous and genuine.</p>

  <p>One by one the artists were called before the curtain, and to none was the
  welcome warmer than to the delicate-featured girl who came timidly forward to
  make her bow.</p>

  <p>Supper had been laid for the party, the top table reserved for the
  players, and here Sir John, in rare high spirits, presided. There was a
  little delay whilst the players changed.</p>

  <p>Mary Gill was the first to be ready.</p>

  <p>"I think I will go now, Miss Brand," she said hurriedly. "I am so afraid
  of not getting home. Father will be out till half-past eleven to-night; it is
  The Brotherhood annual meeting."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but you must stay and have supper," urged Geraldine. The girl
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I should like to very much," she said, "but I am so afraid."</p>

  <p>"I will have the car ready for you, and I will drop you at the corner of
  your street," said Geraldine. "I hate to feel that you have to deceive your
  father in this matter, but if he would only let you go on the stage, I am
  sure you would be a success," she said enthusiastically. "You were simply
  splendid. Come along"&mdash;she patted the girl on the cheek&mdash;"there is
  plenty of time for you; you can have a hurried supper and go."</p>

  <p>The girl hesitated and then accepted. She put down her hat and left her
  coat with the maid. She was not dressed grandly, but then none of the players
  wore evening dress, and her simple gown excited neither comment nor
  remark.</p>

  <p>Sir John had reserved a place next to him.</p>

  <p>"That is for our leading lady," he said.</p>

  <p>Geraldine, to whom the honour of this title undoubtedly belonged, made a
  laughing grimace.</p>

  <p>"We shall see you starring in a theatre one of these days," said Sir John
  with his kindly smile as he turned to the girl. "Your name will be all
  over&mdash;" He stopped.</p>

  <p>Her face had suddenly gone white and tense, her eyes were fixed on the
  door. He followed their direction.</p>

  <p>There stood John Gill, a look of malignant hate upon his face.</p>

  <p>"Mary Gill," he called harshly, and the chatter at the table ceased. "What
  are you doing in this devil's company&mdash;this congregation of the
  damned?"</p>

  <p>The girl was paralysed with terror. She could not move; she could only
  keep her staring eyes fixed upon his set face as he came up through the
  tables towards her.</p>

  <p>The unexpectedness of the apparition had paralysed the waiting footmen,
  and had put a silence even upon Sir John's ready tongue.</p>

  <p>"There she sits," Gill cried out, "in the company of painted harlots and
  wine-bibbing men. Thank God"&mdash;he raised his eyes to the
  ceiling&mdash;"you are no child of mine Ladies and gentlemen"&mdash;his loud
  and sonorous street-preaching voice stood him in good stead&mdash;"I present
  to you the illegitimate child of Lady Heron Wendall, the respected wife of
  your Rector."</p>

  <p>The girl had risen from her seat and shrunk back against the wall, her
  eyes still fixed on his face, oblivious of everything save a desire to leave
  the room, to flee from all those staring eyes, to find some quiet place in
  God's world where her horrible shame should be unknown.</p>

  <p>She knew he spoke the truth, though it came as a revelation to her. She
  could not understand by what circumstance she had been brought into his
  house, or in what circumstance her mother had left her alone with this
  fierce, fanatical man.</p>

  <p>All she desired now was the open air and a straight road, tree shadows to
  veil her, open ditch to hide her, anywhere away from that room, those eyes,
  that drawn face, and the malignant smile of Gill.</p>

  <p>Slowly she moved, like a creature in a dream round by the wall. There was
  a door within half a dozen steps of her, she would make for that.</p>

  <p>"There she is," said Gill, and then two footmen flung themselves at him,
  the door was thrown open, and they went out together, a struggling mass.</p>

  <p>A dead silence fell on the room, and there was not a sound as Lady Heron
  Wendall rose, or indication that anything unusual had happened. She walked
  swiftly towards the cowering girl and put her arms about her.</p>

  <p>"This is my daughter!" she said, and nobody in that room remembered
  hearing her voice sound so soft.</p>

  <p>"My daughter," she repeated almost defiantly, and faced the scrutiny of
  the county, pitiful or triumphant as that scrutiny might be, without a change
  of colour or a tremble of lip.</p>

  <p>Edward Heron Wendall had been at the far end of the room when the
  interruption had come, and now he walked with his long, swinging stride
  towards his wife.</p>

  <p>By her side he stood, that pompous, cold man. "Ladies and gentlemen," he
  said quietly, "such of you who may remember this, may remember, and some of
  you who of your charity would forget, will forget. All that the man Gill said
  was true except one thing. I am the father of this child," and he laid his
  hand upon the girl's shoulder.</p>

  <p>Beatrice saw his eyes, and for the second time in his life she saw upon
  his face the smile which was very beautiful.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">XII. &mdash; THE CHAIRWOMAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The bright yellow sunlight of an April morning piercing its
  way through the space between blinds and wall fell across the dainty white
  bed and crept up till it touched the face of the sleeping girl. She awoke
  with a start and put her hands before her eyes. Then she stared about the
  room. Where was she? She remembered, and covered her face with her hands. It
  was true, then, this troubled dream which had disturbed the night. There came
  a gentle knock at the door.</p>

  <p>"Come in," she said.</p>

  <p>Her mother walked into the room with a little silver tray bearing a cup of
  steaming chocolate and butter and hot toast. She put the tray down on the
  table, bent over the girl and kissed her.</p>

  <p>"How did you sleep, dear?" she asked.</p>

  <p>There was a look in her eyes of infinite yearning as she scanned the face
  of the girl.</p>

  <p>"Thank you so much, Lady Beatrice," began Mary, and the woman put her soft
  hands over the girl's mouth gently.</p>

  <p>"If you want to make me very happy," she said, "you must call me
  mother."</p>

  <p>Mary's eyes filled with tears.</p>

  <p>"You are called Mary, are you not?" she asked. "Yon were christened that,
  I know."</p>

  <p>"I hardly like to call you mother," said Mary shyly, smiling through her
  tears.</p>

  <p>"You must try, dear."</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice sat on the edge of the bed and smoothed the girl's hair</p>

  <p>"You know you are my own little daughter."</p>

  <p>"It seems rather absurd, does it not?" said Mary, looking up in wonder at
  her mother's face. "You see it doesn't seem possible that you could be old
  enough to have a daughter of my age."</p>

  <p>"It is true, though," said Lady Beatrice, with a little smile. "But it
  means something awful for you, doesn't it?" Mary sat up in bed and clasped
  her mother's hands between her own.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it mean something dreadful, something disgraceful? Wasn't that
  what he meant when he spoke so horribly in front of all those people?"</p>

  <p>"He meant to be horrid, I think," said her mother; "instead he did me a
  great service. I never suspected you, I must have seen you, too," she mused.
  "I seem to know all the people in Bulboro', and all these years you have been
  living so close to me."</p>

  <p>She looked down into the girl's face, into her eyes, and saw something
  which brought a little pang of delicious sorrow. She had seen eyes like
  those, that had looked so lovingly and as wistfully, dear eyes that lived
  with her day and night. "There is nothing horrid, dear, nothing disgraceful.
  It cannot be very disgraceful to have a daughter like you," she smiled, and
  patted her cheek. "I want you to lie in bed this morning because I think you
  had rather a trying time, and afterwards I am going to take you for a
  holiday. You have never been abroad, have you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," the girl said, her eyes lighting up. "To France?"</p>

  <p>"France, if you like," smiled 'Lady Beatrice. "We should be in time for
  the snows if we went to Switzerland. It may not be too late for winter sport,
  but if we are there, there are many other forms of amusement. Would you like
  to go to Cairo?</p>

  <p>"Oh, I should love it," said the girl. "Do you really mean all this? Why
  must we go?" she asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"So that we can get used to one another," said her mother quickly, "so
  that you can learn to call me mother, and not Lady Beatrice, for one thing;
  so that I can realize that this beautiful child is mine." She leant down and
  kissed her, and a big tear dropped on the girl's face. With an impulsive
  gesture she put up her arms and clasped the woman about the neck.</p>

  <p>"I am so happy," she sobbed, "so very, very happy."</p>

  <p>"So am I, dear," said Lady Beatrice as she gently disengaged the arms,
  "and so you shall be for all time, dearie, and you must think and feel to me
  always nicely and sweetly, and forgivingly, because you have a great deal to
  forgive. You will be older some day," she said with a smile; "it is a trick
  we have, and then you will be asking yourself all sorts of questions, and you
  will be wondering why I did this or I did not do that, and there will be an
  inclination on your part to condemn me, and probably if I were in your place
  I also would condemn, but I hope you will be a little charitable to me,
  remembering that a woman is a very powerless kind of being. She is born to
  slavery, pleasant or unpleasant, but none the less slavery. She has no right
  to do what she wishes, must stand at the bidding of some man or other,
  whether he be her father or her husband."</p>

  <p>She bent over the girl and kissed her again.</p>

  <p>"But there are some very nice men in the world," she said, and her mind at
  that moment was on her husband.</p>

  <p>Whatever doubts Lady Heron Wendall may have had about the attitude Jerry
  would adopt were dispelled a few minutes later. She had gone down to her
  little boudoir, and had seated herself at her writing-table, when the door
  burst open and Jerry flew in. Without a word she went straight to the elder
  woman and clasped her in her arms.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear, my dear," she said, "it was so brave of you, so splendid of
  you!"</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice kissed the fresh young cheek and held her out at arms'
  length, her hands upon her shoulder's.</p>

  <p>"Now, Jerry," she warned her with a little laugh, though the tears in her
  eyes betrayed how deeply she felt, "you must not get excited views about a
  woman who has committed a sin and has continued in a cowardly action for
  fifteen years. Even though she makes reparation at a moment when from purely
  physical weariness and boredom she does not care one way or other what people
  think."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but it was so brave of you," said Jerry. "I just love you. I have
  told everybody I am going to stand by you, whatever happens."</p>

  <p>A little frown gathered for a moment on the forehead of Lady Heron
  Wendall, but it was immediately dispelled, and she laughed.</p>

  <p>"Why, Jerry, you are a wonderful champion, but championship implies the
  necessity for championing. I think you had better not speak about it,
  dearie," she said kindly. "Edward is the only hero in the piece."</p>

  <p>The girl nodded. She was on the verge of tears herself. "He was fine,
  wasn't he?" she said. "I never thought Edward had it in him."</p>

  <p>"The older one gets," said Beatrice, as she went with the girl to the big
  settee, "the more one realizes that the human heart is a wonderful,
  mysterious thing. I have lived with Edward in a sort of a way," she smiled,
  "for fourteen years, and I never knew him as I know him now."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"Edward is leaving this diocese," she said. "It is awfully hard upon him,
  because he loves the work here. But he has been most generous and kind; we
  talked it all out last night. The living, of course, is nothing, but I am
  afraid it is going to spoil Edward's chance of promotion." She smiled
  faintly. "It is an awful pity. Edward would have made such a lovely
  bishop."</p>

  <p>"Can I see?" asked the girl hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>"I do not think you had better," said Beatrice. "Poor little girl, she is
  scared and troubled with the excitement of these unusual happenings. We are
  going away this morning."</p>

  <p>"This morning?" asked the girl, startled.</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice nodded.</p>

  <p>"If we stay for a day we may as well stay forever," she said. "The car
  will take us to London, and from there I have mapped out a little tour for
  Mary."</p>

  <p>Jerry was silent.</p>

  <p>"Daddy says&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"What does daddy say?" asked Beatrice interestedly.</p>

  <p>"Daddy says that he wants to do anything that is possible for you and
  Mary. He says," she went on naively, "that if you by any chance should think
  of going on the Continent, he knows quite a lot of nice quiet places."</p>

  <p>Lady Heron Wendall laughed the first laugh of genuine amusement the girl
  had ever heard from her.</p>

  <p>"I dare say he does," she said dryly.</p>

  <p>"Why, what do you mean?" asked the girl in wonder.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing," smiled Lady Beatrice. "You are to tell your daddy he is a
  good soul, and that I shall remember him very kindly."</p>

  <p>The girl looked at her in dismay.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice," she said, "you are talking as though we are never going to see
  you again."</p>

  <p>"Of course you are going to see me again," said Beatrice. "We are going to
  meet lots of times. I shall want you to know my Mary. I think she will be
  worth knowing; she is worth knowing now," she corrected herself. "This
  reminds me that Mrs. Gill is coming up to see her this morning. I have sent
  down asking her to come. Poor soul, I am rather sorry for her. Evidently,
  from what Mary told me last night, Mrs. Gill has been most kind and motherly
  to her." She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You will think it curious," she said, "but I feel jealous of Mrs. Gill
  already."</p>

  <p>The car, with the baggage on top, passed Anthony Manton as he was driving
  from seeing a patient who lived a few miles outside the town. They passed in
  a narrow road, where both cars slowed, down, and Anthony had time to rise and
  wave a cheery farewell.</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice signalled him to stop, and he went back to her. She leaned
  over the car.</p>

  <p>"I only wanted to say," she said, lowering her voice, "that I am tasting
  some of the happiness which has been so long denied to me."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand and gripped hers.</p>

  <p>"I think you are getting near to the realities of life," he said.</p>

  <p>He nodded cheerfully to the girl, and with a word or two as to the road,
  and to the possibility of their meeting in the near future, they parted.</p>

  <p>Anthony walked back to the car light of heart. He was becoming more
  humanized, the people were growing in interest, he was part of the domestic
  system of Bulboro', tainted perhaps with some of its conventions, but a
  consciousness of propriety is not an unpleasing sensation.</p>

  <p>In the course of the next few days he had occasion to meet Geraldine
  Brand, not once but many times. One of the innumerable "movements" to which
  the leisure and the temperament of Bulboro' gave birth was in the throes of
  inception. And since it had to do directly with medicine, he was called in
  with the other doctors as an honorary member of the committee.</p>

  <p>The movement was rendered necessary by the abortive attempt of a few
  genial and enthusiastic souls to create an Advisory League in Bulboro'. They
  had attempted the impossible, and had failed to their intense astonishment.
  For, setting out with the object of helping with words, they had come into
  conflict with hundreds of families which had words to spare, but needed some
  more tangible means of assistance than a cheerful quotation from the
  classics.</p>

  <p>The new scheme was the foundation of a women's and children's hospital on
  a modest scale. Beyond the dispensary and the infirmary and the little
  cottage hospital, which was mainly supported by the proprietors of the tin
  works, who also furnished most of the patients, there was no hospital
  accommodation in Bulboro' for the women and children.</p>

  <p>The League of Good Advice, if it had accomplished no more than this, had
  discovered the urgent necessity for such an institution.</p>

  <p>There were members of the rank and file of this admirable body who were
  anxious to see some result of their labours, and these had concentrated upon
  the question of the women's hospital.</p>

  <p>Anthony was an attendant, and fairly interested listener, at all the
  meetings. Much that was said was superfluous, much that was argued was
  nonsensical; the views of amateurs are always irritating to the professional
  man and the Utopian schemes which were outlined, the dream fabrics which were
  erected, first exasperated and then amused.</p>

  <p>He was pleased to note that of all the suggestions put forward, Jerry's
  were the most practical. He had no idea as to why he derived any pleasure
  from seeing her shine in those assemblies, and analysing his feelings in his
  scientific way, he came to the conclusion that he owed her a debt of approval
  which it was a pleasure to pay. The first meeting had been cheerful, the
  second wildly optimistic. It was at the third meeting that gloom fell upon
  the little committee. The county had been canvassed, and the promises of
  assistance had not been encouraging.</p>

  <p>Sir John Brand had headed the subscription list with a thousand guineas in
  his generous way.</p>

  <p>An unfortunate donation it proved, for the remainder of the county,
  appalled by the largeness of the figure and not desirous of showing too great
  a gap between their own contributions and Sir John's, had found many
  excellent reasons for not subscribing anything.</p>

  <p>The committee meeting was a representative one. Not only was the medical
  profession well represented, but the possible builders, the proprietors of
  the land on which the women's hospital was to be erected, and the likely
  furnisher of the building when it was built, had also been invited to
  attend.</p>

  <p>The estimates now lay before Jerry, who had been elected chairwoman, and
  now she sat with Lord Bexley on her right hand and her father on her left,
  admirable cicerones and sufficient guarantee that the conduct of the meeting
  would be irreproachably in order, and the gloom which had struck the room was
  reflected on her face.</p>

  <p>"It seems fairly hopeless, doesn't it?" she said, as she pushed back the
  pad upon which she had been scribbling. "I think the county has been most
  mean about this."</p>

  <p>"Do not report that," said Sir John to the reporter who sat behind, and
  the smiling scribe nodded.</p>

  <p>"We want forty thousand pounds," she went on, "and we have got exactly
  eighteen. How much are you giving, Bexley?"</p>

  <p>She was an unconventional chairwoman, and the young man at her side
  wriggled.</p>

  <p>"I shall give five hundred pounds," he said. "Haven't you got it
  down?"</p>

  <p>"I have written a thousand," she said gloomily; "that makes another five
  hundred to find."</p>

  <p>"Steady the Buffs, dearie," whispered her father. "You will have nothing
  if you are not careful."</p>

  <p>"Do you think," somebody asked at the other end of the table, "it would be
  a wise plan to let the matter stand over for a year until things are
  better?"</p>

  <p>"Things will never be better," said Geraldine, darkly. "I have been alive
  quite a long time, and I have never known things to be prosperous. They are
  either going to be or they have been. National prosperity has no present,"
  she said, and the knowledge that she had perpetrated an epigram cheered her
  up. "Here is the fact, we want twenty-two thousand pounds," she said, "and
  here is another fact, that the hospital is necessary. You agree with me, Dr.
  Manton?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," he said. "I think it is a crying shame that Bulboro' has not
  a women's hospital, and in this I think I am voicing the opinion of all
  members of my profession." He looked round, and there was a murmur of
  approval.</p>

  <p>"This is not the first time the hospital has been projected," said the
  girl. "Three years ago we tried to get a fund together, but whenever there is
  money to be spent," she said bitterly, "it is employed in the erection of
  ridiculous drinking fountains or jubilee clocks&mdash;like that horrible and
  unnecessary thing we have on The Chad&mdash;I am astounded that Bulboro' can
  be so foolish with its money."</p>

  <p>Anthony smiled behind his hand. She was so young and bright and illogical,
  and so full of energy in the attainment of her object.</p>

  <p>"Is it absolutely certain," he asked, "that you will get no more money
  from anybody in the county?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely certain," said the girl. "My last hope was old Lady Burdin,
  but she has definitely declined owing to the extraordinary demand made upon
  her income by the new land taxes."</p>

  <p>She mimicked her parsimonious ladyship rather neatly. "Jerry, Jerry,"
  warned her father, "for the Lord's sake, be careful."</p>

  <p>"I do not care," said the girl wrathfully. "I am tired of this town; they
  will not do anything for themselves, they won't raise or stir a finger for
  their own good. The poor want charity, and the rich seem only willing to
  extend it if they are allowed freedom from taxation."</p>

  <p>"Hear, hear," said the Radical minister by her side.</p>

  <p>There was a long and an empty silence, if silence could have that quality,
  which Anthony broke.</p>

  <p>"I would like to say something before we disperse," he said. "You all knew
  my uncle, and you all know that I am practically a new-comer amongst you, and
  that I have not had much opportunity of making myself acquainted with the
  people of this town. But such opportunity as I have had has demonstrated to
  me that my uncle was universally beloved."</p>

  <p>"That is so," said a voice. "Everybody loved old Jabez Manton."</p>

  <p>"So I understand," said Anthony, "and so I can well believe, for he was a
  lovable man, the only lovable man I have ever met in my life," he said
  thoughtfully. "Therefore I feel that he would like me to do something to
  perpetuate a memory, and not only perpetuate it, but to give some material
  proof of the love for this town. I have much pleasure, therefore, on his
  behalf, and to his memory, in making up the sum to the required amount."</p>

  <p>"But," said the girl, aghast, "that means twenty-two thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"Twenty-two thousand five hundred," said Anthony, with a smile, and caught
  Lord Edward's eye.</p>

  <p>The smile was reflected.</p>

  <p>"Make it twenty-two thousand, doctor; I will bring up my subscription to
  the even thousand."</p>

  <p>There was a burst of applause, and Geraldine felt happy but
  uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>It was splendid of the doctor, but had he not been dragged into it?</p>

  <p>She was frankness itself, she had not yet learned the value of
  discretion.</p>

  <p>"But you have been bullied into this, doctor?" she said with a smile. "I
  feel horribly responsible. If I had not grumbled you would not have felt the
  need."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I should," he said. "I had made up my mind that you would have a
  deficiency from the very start, and I had also made up my mind to supply
  whatever that deficiency was. I do not want this matter to get into the
  papers," he said, with a stern eye on the reporter, "and I should be greatly
  obliged to our friend if he would refrain from recording the fact."</p>

  <p>But the gentleman closed his notebook resolutely.</p>

  <p>For two hours, at the whispered request of Sir John Brand, he had been
  erasing the indiscretions of Geraldine Brand from his
  notebook&mdash;indiscretions which would have made a very interesting
  story.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I cannot oblige you," he said. "There are certain things
  which must necessarily be made public."</p>

  <p>Reporters as a rule do not address county committees, but this reporter
  was an unusual young man. He was also the editor of the <i>Bulboro'
  Herald</i>, and had had a London training, which totally unfits a man for any
  form of respect for the landed gentry.</p>

  <p>Anthony would have hurried away, but the girl came out to him when she saw
  him making a move from the room.</p>

  <p>"Doctor, I still feel guilty," she said, "and I think you have behaved
  magnificently, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is no 'but' about it. This is the course I set out to adopt, and
  this is the course in which you must allow me to continue. It so happens that
  you and I have hit upon Bulboro's one need independently, and I want you to
  believe that I am not the sort of man to be bullied into giving away
  largesse." He smiled, and offered his hand, and the girl took it.</p>

  <p>"I think we shall all be good friends one of these days," she said, with
  that open laugh of hers.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he said, half to himself. "I am afraid I am not a great social
  success."</p>

  <p>"You are a very bad bridge player, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"I admit that," he said humbly, "but then, I am a pretty good doctor."</p>

  <p>"I admit that," she said graciously. "We have reached a solid foundation
  for friendship, anyway."</p>

  <p>She went back to Bexley with a thoughtful little frown. "What is troubling
  you, Jerry?" asked Bexley. "Thoughts," she said.</p>

  <p>"I say, how stunning of old Manton to give that."</p>

  <p>"Which is old Manton?" she asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I mean the doctor man I always think that all doctors are old, or ought
  to be."</p>

  <p>"I always think that Cabinet Ministers are old, or should pretend to be,"
  she said severely. "You behaved very meanly, too. I have a bone to pick with
  you."</p>

  <p>"Pick it at tea," he said, "for I am starving."</p>

  <p>They drove up together. Sir John had business in the town, and they took
  their meal alone.</p>

  <p>Bexley was nervous and the girl was a little dismayed. She knew the
  symptoms too well, and was unusually perturbed, for she liked Bexley too well
  to hurt him.</p>

  <p>"I have something to ask you," he said after the tea-things had been
  cleared away.</p>

  <p>"Come along and get it over," she smiled. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Jerry," he said awkwardly for him, "I have known you for quite a
  long time, and we have practically grown up as boy and girl together. I am a
  Catholic and all that sort of thing, and you are Church, but I do not think
  that need make any difference. In fact," he stammered, "I want you to marry
  me."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with genuine affection in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Bexley," she said, "I would like to do anything for you, because you are
  really a good sort but I just do not want to marry&mdash;that is all."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps in a year or two," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"I don't think it would be wise," she said, "to depend on me even in a
  year or two. I am an erratic individual; I would not trust myself a
  week."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" he said.</p>

  <p>He took the rebuff manfully.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it would not be fair to ask if there was anybody else."</p>

  <p>"There are about twenty others," she smiled; "but there is not one of them
  to whom I feel exactly as I feel towards you."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, that is over," he said with a sigh.</p>

  <p>"I do not want this to make any difference to us, Jerry. You are too sweet
  a girl, too inspiring a friend, to surrender, and I would rather anything
  happen than that you should think&mdash;" He hesitated for a word.</p>

  <p>"What can I think," she said gently, "but that you are a dear, good man,
  and that I have led you quite an awful dance and have probably in all
  deliberation set myself out to make you think that I cared for you."</p>

  <p>"Oh no, you haven't," he protested, that is one of the illusions I have
  never had."</p>

  <p>"Anyway, I have encouraged you," she went on; "but then it has been
  because we were boy and girl together, Bex. We have grown up to depend on one
  another rather."</p>

  <p>"Let us say no more about it, old girl," he said, and patted her
  affectionately on the shoulder. "I dare say a very nice man will come along
  one of these days and whisk you off between the first and second
  dinner-gongs."</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"I could wish for nothing less expeditious, when he comes," she said. "I
  don't want to think; I am a perfectly rotten thinker, Bex. No sooner do I
  start worrying out the wherefores and the whys of any situation, than I
  realize that whatever I have done and whatever I am likely to do must be
  wrong."</p>

  <p>"Your philosophy is of the German school," he said cheerfully, "and that
  is horribly old-fashioned. We are all optimistic nowadays."</p>

  <p>"Jerry," he said after a pause, "you will not think I am a beast if I ask
  you a question when you have answered it practically?"</p>

  <p>She was looking out of a window which commanded a view of the drive up to
  High Mount.</p>

  <p>"It is not he, is it?" asked Bexley.</p>

  <p>"Who? Mr. Stope?" She turned her startled face to him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stope?" he said, bewildered. "What the dickens are you talking about?
  No, I mean the doctor."</p>

  <p>She laughed a full ringing peal of laughter.</p>

  <p>"My dear Bexley," she said, "how absurd you are; of all people in the
  world, the doctor!</p>

  <p>"Why did you say Mr. Stope?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Because he was coming up the drive at that particular moment."</p>

  <p>"Here?" Bexley was genuinely surprised.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she said. "Mr. Stope and I are quite good friends. Come along
  and meet him."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know him all right," smiled Bexley; "he is to be our candidate at
  the election."</p>

  <p>"When is that going to happen?" she asked.</p>

  <p>She was not particularly interested. Few women are interested in politics,
  but at some labour she had acquired a working knowledge of the subject for
  Bexley's sake.</p>

  <p>"In a month or so," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Am I supposed to wish you people luck?" she asked as they went down the
  stairs together.</p>

  <p>He made a little face.</p>

  <p>"If you have seriously decided to engage in a career of hypocrisy you
  might as well start in that pleasant way," he suggested. "What is Stope's
  immediate business?"</p>

  <p>"I expect it is about that unfortunate man Gill," she answered, with a
  serious little frown. "Daddy dismissed him, you know, and Mr. Stope is trying
  to persuade us to take him back again."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stope had all the charm and all the drawing-room manner which his
  confrères lacked. He could walk into a drawing-room without arousing in the
  breast of the most earnest Churchwoman the slightest apprehension that his
  full-skirted coat would destroy the bric-à-brac incautiously displayed on
  spindle-legged tables.</p>

  <p>A tall man, he gave, because of the narrowing influence of his sombre
  uniform, an impression of thinness which was undeserved. He had a slight
  stoop which was unnoticed in the pulpit, but which was very noticeable closer
  at hand. It was an attitude symbolical of his life-work. He was forever
  leaning over his people&mdash;he stooped to the world and was conscious of
  the fact. Mr. Stope's face was long, and his complexion good. He had a slight
  fair moustache, and long golden-brown hair which was swept back from his
  forehead but had a trick of reappearing on his face by way of his temples. He
  wore a double stand-up collar and a little white tie, not unlike that
  affected by the journeyman undertaker. Whatever might be said to his
  detriment&mdash;and he had a few bitter critics even in his own
  church&mdash;and however his political tendencies might be condemned, he was
  an attractive personality. There was a kindliness and an intelligence in his
  eye which was utterly at variance with the drastic uncharity of his worldly
  views. For Mr. Stope was, in addition to being a moving preacher, a most
  enthusiastic supporter of the Liberal party.</p>

  <p>He, perhaps more than any other, was the hope of Radicalism in the county.
  Bulshire was strictly Tory. Bulboro' itself a Radical stronghold lying at its
  very heart, irradicable, unchangeable and unabashed. There had always been
  located in the town one strong forceful individual, who had stood a rallying
  point against the combined attacks of the vested interests of Torydom. That
  he was inviting the town to return him to Parliament was all to the good up
  to a point, for he seemed pretty certain to succeed even with the defection
  of so large a body of the electorate as that which had recently carried
  dismay to the agent. Yet, in a sense, his parliamentary candidature was a
  weakness; because the party leaders had a shrewd suspicion that his success
  at the polls would entail his retirement from active work in Bulboro', and
  (which was almost as important) from the service of the church. He was an
  ambitious, though a very sincere, man, and his eyes had turned to a larger
  sphere of influence and to the virgin field of statesmanship, perhaps. He
  hoped, as how many others similarly placed, that success at the election
  would secure for him the larger opportunities which the metropolis offered.
  There was even the probability that a "call" might be extended to him which
  would carry with it the pastorship of one of the four great congregations of
  America. These represented the plums of his profession. There is no
  suggestion that Mr. Stope was not either a genuine Christian or an earnest
  reformer; he lived in a period which made little demand upon religious
  fervour, and was tolerant of self-seeking. He was one of a batch of young
  Nonconformist ministers who had seen the value of partisanship as a means of
  securing personal advancement. It is no sin for men who preach the Gospel to
  be possessed of personal ambition, though he and his friends were at pains to
  protest to the few shocked Nonconformists who felt that this life, especially
  in the case of a minister, should be in a sense a painful probation for an
  idyllic future, that he served religion best by concentrating his attention
  upon the bodily and material needs of God's creatures. For how might a man be
  spiritually sweet, if he were sweated by Tory employers, and penned in foul
  slums by Tory landlords?</p>

  <p>As for himself&mdash;one must live; even the apostles followed their
  worldly ambitions up to a point, and might not a minister of the Gospel
  exercise his influence to God's glory in the worldly atmosphere of the House
  of Commons?</p>

  <p>Might not a young zealot, fired with an enthusiasm for his fellows'
  welfare, filled with a divine love of humanity which his calling had produced
  and fostered, be at an advantage in the councils of the nation? There was so
  much that wanted doing in the world, and in England. So many wrongs to right,
  so many crying injustices which pressed heavily upon the poor and upon the
  suffering and upon the helpless, which a man going about his Master's
  business might rectify with the sheer weight of his righteousness. And it was
  easier for a parson to enter the precincts of the House of Commons than it
  was for the rich man to enter heaven.</p>

  <p>His pulpit was an ideal platform. Convention did not allow the
  interruption, the heckling, the denial or the expression of disapproval when
  views, however drastic and however obnoxious to some of his hearers, were
  expressed from the floor beneath the sounding-board.</p>

  <p>A minister had unique opportunities, and perfectly sincere men engaged in
  the chapels and churches of England had realized the possibilities which
  their calling offered to them.</p>

  <p>Stope himself was one of the pioneers of the political Church movement. He
  had gathered into his fold men who were politicians and Christians.</p>

  <p>Whether they were politicians first and Christians afterwards is not a
  matter for discussion, since none but a bigot could dogmatize upon the
  subject.</p>

  <p>It was a powerful testimony to Stope's eloquence that he persuaded men who
  had no other business in life but the salvation of their souls that the way
  of salvation lay in the direction of labour, and that that labour was
  provided by the cause, and for the objects, he represented.</p>

  <p>He was a well-educated man&mdash;the son of a Lincolnshire farmer who had
  been well-to-do, and who had left him a competence which had been increased
  by other legacies to something which was nearly approaching to a fortune.</p>

  <p>He was an Oxford graduate, not an unusual circumstance, for the branch of
  Nonconformity for which he stood offered bigger prizes to the educated
  classes than the Church into which so many University men found their way. He
  had the suavity and the good manners which are generally inseparable from the
  educated classes, a fact which made him not only tolerated but liked by
  people who would give short shrift to a St. Peter if he ate with his
  knife.</p>

  <p>Now he met Geraldine with a frank smile which lighted up his face and gave
  to it an expression which was almost angelic. He shook hands cordially with
  Bexley, and exchanged a few words on the Parliamentary outlook before he came
  to the business in hand.</p>

  <p>"You do not mind my cousin knowing all about this unfortunate business?"
  asked Geraldine.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," smiled Mr. Stope. "It is an unfortunate business all round.
  You see, Gill is useful to me in two capacities, though it is, of course, as
  a Christian man that I regard him as most useful. He is really one of Pastor
  Childe's men, but he is associated with me in a number of ways&mdash;Childe
  and I work together in many of the Christian organizations of Bulboro'. And
  the awkward thing is," he went on despairingly, "that I am perfectly
  satisfied in my mind with the justice of Sir John's action. It was a most
  dreadful thing that Gill did&mdash;unpardonable. The man is frenetic and
  entirely unmanageable. Of course," he went on quickly, "I have a great deal
  of sympathy with Gill, because I realize something of his sincerity, however
  mistaken he may be, and I do so want to persuade Sir John to give the man
  another chance."</p>

  <p>The girl looked dubious. "I don't know how successful we are going to be,
  Mr. Stope," she doubted, "because a more powerful advocate even than I has
  written to Sir John&mdash;Lady Heron Wendall herself."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stope murmured something which was complimentary to Lady Beatrice.</p>

  <p>"And daddy's point is that he will only reinstate Gill on condition that
  he undertakes to make a public apology to Lady Beatrice."</p>

  <p>"That he will not do, I am afraid," said Stope regretfully; "he is
  perfectly satisfied in his own mind that he was justified in the action he
  took."</p>

  <p>"That is not your view, of course, Mr. Stope," said Bexley quietly.</p>

  <p>Stope shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing that Gill has done in this matter of which I approve,"
  he said. "I thought it was pretty beastly of him to beat the boy in the first
  place, and though I think the sentence was unnecessarily harsh, still there
  was a central germ of justice in his punishment. We have to deal with very
  curious forces in Bulboro'&mdash;with people who are good people in every
  sense of the word, but who are out of touch with the true spirit of
  Christianity. It is the 'Old Testament Christian' who is the most
  contradictory, and it is an unfortunate and embarrassing fact that the two
  books are not absolutely harmonious in the spirit of their teaching. The
  Mosaic law is incompatible with the exercise of Christian charity to a very
  great extent, but there are some ingenious souls who have so completely
  reconciled turning their cheek to the smiter with the eye for an eye'
  doctrine, that they are able to justify their conduct by both injunctions.
  Gill is an out-and-out eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth' man whom it is
  almost impossible to argue out of his settled view."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you see Dr. Manton?" suggested the girl. Mr. Stope smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid Dr. Manton is almost as impossible as Gill," he said dryly.
  "We tried to approach him on the matter once before. I know it was done
  rather tactlessly. I had nothing to do with it," he excused himself, "but he
  might perhaps have been a little more yielding. I am sorry about Manton," he
  went on thoughtfully. "There is a lot that I greatly admire. But he seems
  determined to adopt an attitude of passive hostility to the Christian bodies
  of Bulboro'; at least, that is the general impression."</p>

  <p>He stayed for a while talking, and Bexley accompanied him back to the
  town.</p>

  <p>The girl, left alone, had much to occupy her thoughts. There was some real
  hard work awaiting her as a result of the astonishing meeting of that
  afternoon; letters to be dictated, plans to be formulated.</p>

  <p>But for some reason which she could not explain to herself her enthusiasm
  for the Cottage Hospital had been a little damped by the unexpected success
  of the scheme. It was not the failure of the county to respond to her appeal
  which depressed her, though she realized that had the result been as she
  anticipated, and had the subscriptions been made up of a large number of
  small but sympathetic donations, the cause of her depression would have
  vanished.</p>

  <p>She was a little uncomfortable at the thought that she had dragooned
  Anthony into his munificence, in spite of his protest and in spite of the
  plausibility of his statement.</p>

  <p>Nor was her present state of mind to be traced to the reaction of
  accomplishment.</p>

  <p>She was puzzled, and sought about for an explanation. In her mental
  travels she came upon Anthony Manton not once but many times, and each vision
  provoked a little frown, which was not of annoyance, which was not exactly of
  fear, and which was not wholly of wonder.</p>

  <p>She analysed her condition of discontent down to the fact that she was
  under an obligation to a man whom she had originally started out to dislike,
  and no sooner had this analysis been completed than she dismissed it as one
  which for some reason or other she had no desire to perpetuate. It occurred
  to her that it would be a graceful act upon her part to send him some little
  souvenir of that meeting, even if it only took the form of a tiny letter of
  thanks for his generosity.</p>

  <p>There was on her desk, in her own little snuggery, a large portrait of
  herself which had recently arrived from London and had passed her critical
  scrutiny. It showed only her head and shoulders, and the photographer had
  succeeded in presenting not only the likeness of a beautiful girl, not only
  something of the colouring of her fair wavy hair and her clear grey eyes,
  but, too, a hint of the character which lay behind the mask of beauty and was
  not altogether thrust into the background by the retoucher's art.</p>

  <p>She picked it up and removed it from its transparent envelope. It would be
  rather a theatrical thing to do, to send him the portrait, and an inscription
  scribbled upon its rough border might be even more theatrical. Yet for some
  indefinable reason she wanted him to have this picture.</p>

  <p>She was all at sea as to the propriety of such an act&mdash;she who was an
  acknowledged authority upon what constituted correctness in social
  intercourse. She went to her father's study in the hope and the fear that he
  had returned. In hope, since one half of her demanded support and approval in
  an act which she told herself might be foolish; in fear, lest he confirmed
  her in her suspicion of theatricality. He had not returned, however, and she
  searched the table for an envelope to carry the photograph, a search which
  told her to her own surprise that she had already made up her mind as to the
  course of action she would take.</p>

  <p>She compromised on the question of inscription, enclosing a little note
  instead.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Dear Dr. Manton</span>,&mdash;I am
  sending you a picture of myself, not that it may have any particular value,
  but that you may on some future occasion in recounting to yourself the
  pleasure you have given to a great number of people&mdash;for I suppose we
  all have in our lives a period of depression when some such flattering
  reflection is welcome&mdash;you may recall the spectre of an embarrassed
  chairwoman whom you saved from social extinction. I am indeed very very
  grateful to you."</p><br>

  <p>She signed the letter, after some contemplation, "Yours sincerely ", and
  no sooner had the photograph been dispatched than she wished most heartily
  that she had confined herself to a conventional note of thanks.</p>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Hotel Des Alpes</span>,<br>
  "<span class="smcap">Chamonix</span>.<br>
  <br>
  "<span class="smcap">My Dear Trusty Man</span>,&mdash;Here we are resting at
  the foot of Mont Blanc, my dear daughter, big-eyed with wonder at the new
  world which ten pounds' worth of railway tickets have secured for her.<br>
  <br>
  "We stayed for a day or so in Geneva, but the weather was bad, a horrible
  gloomy mist lay on the lake and a chill damp wind made life intolerable. Yet
  she was happy enough in the very strangeness of the surroundings, and when in
  irony, jesting at my own expense, I suggested a motor-boat trip on that
  terrible lake, she was all glee. Everything pleases her: the quaint chalets,
  the unusual dress of the peasants, even that ridiculous little horn with
  which the railway guards are armed are a constant source of bubbling joy.<br>
  <br>
  "It is becoming so real thing to me&mdash;this motherhood; I almost glory in
  what was once a bitter memory. It was a name, a terrible experience then, now
  it has become something which inspires pride and thankfulness. I have a
  thousand plans for her future&mdash;but I am getting away from my narrative.
  The prospect of a rheumatic cruise on Lake Leman filled me with a
  panic&mdash;I 'remembered' that we should see the Alps. So here we are in a
  big airy suite, with old Mont Blanc, his absurdly smooth head gilded by the
  rising sun, serenely upraised before me as I write. The Saison d'hiver has
  not concluded, happily, and I have equipped Mary with the livery of the
  sport.<br>
  <br>
  "At this moment she is moving very gingerly round the rink on the arm of a
  fat German skating-master. There are few English people here just
  now&mdash;they come mostly in the summer, so the place is quite unspoilt by
  tourists. Everybody is most charming&mdash;your French gentleman on his
  holiday is a cheery soul.<br>
  <br>
  "I find the possession of a daughter a very absorbing occupation. More than
  this, I am humiliated by my profound ignorance, for though the child has gone
  beyond the age of everlasting interrogation, yet she is eager to learn, and
  I, alas! am quite incompetent to instruct her. <i>Par exemple</i>&mdash;I
  have invariably accepted the Alps as rather an imposing collection of
  mountains designed by nature to put puny mankind in its place, with a sense
  of his own insignificance. Mont Blanc is a lazy old round-headed mountain
  which has been climbed by divers persons at divers times. But Mary has gone
  beyond me.<br>
  <br>
  "Do you know the Aiguille Verte? That it is the next highest in the range to
  Mont Blanc itself, that the Aiguille de la Republique has only been climbed
  once, and that by the aid of a rope shot across the top by a cross-bow? Mary
  knows this and has told me to my astonishment. She is so sweetly grave when
  she tells me such things as these. Her great dark eyes are fixed on me with a
  look of interest which almost breaks my heart to see. For you know there were
  eyes like hers once in this world, eyes that you saw and that I see all the
  time.<br>
  <br>
  "She speaks French already&mdash;is it not extraordinary? My French is
  horribly English. I can write perfectly, but just as soon as I begin talking
  there comes into the French listener's face that worried straining look which
  is eloquent of my terrible pronunciation. Mary has nothing like my
  vocabulary, but she just says the words she knows so naturally that everybody
  understands her.<br>
  <br>
  "She speaks kindly of Mr. Gill, though I wince every time she makes a slip
  and calls him 'father.' Of her own father she seldom speaks. I have given her
  one of the two photographs which you brought home with you showing him in his
  tropical uniform, and I have told her how he accepted service under the Congo
  Government to organize the police in that great stretch of barbarous country.
  She does not ask inconvenient questions&mdash;I do not think she could. Thank
  God for breed&mdash;Henri, as you know, was a son of the Duc d'Avilliers.<br>
  <br>
  "This is a rambling letter, dear doctor man, but I felt constrained to write,
  even though I had no other excuse than my desire to let you know I think of
  you with gratitude&mdash;and because, perhaps, there is none other in the
  world with whom I can talk with perfect freedom.<br>
  <br>
  "We shall be here or hereabouts for some time. We sleigh to-day to Argentière
  to meet the proprietor of Le Planet Hotel, who (so Mary tells me!) is a
  famous guide.<br>
  <br>
  "Yours very sincerely,<br>
  <br>
  "<span class="smcap">Beatrice Heron Wendall</span>."</p><br>

  <p>Anthony Manton received the letter at breakfast, and it was a coincidence
  that with the letter Jocks had brought word that Gill was waiting to see the
  doctor.</p>

  <p>"What does he want?" asked Anthony in surprise.</p>

  <p>"He did not say, sir," said Jocks, "though I pointed out to him that you
  never under any circumstances saw patients here&mdash;he simply said that he
  wanted to see you on an urgent matter of business."</p>

  <p>"Let him wait in the drawing-room," said Anthony.</p>

  <p>He finished his breakfast and locked away his correspondence before he
  went into the room where Gill waited.</p>

  <p>The man was looking white and ill, Anthony thought, but he was in no sense
  subdued, as his first words went to prove.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Manton," he said in his high, harsh voice as Anthony entered the
  room, "I have come to discuss with you your soul's salvation."</p>

  <p>Anthony looked at him thoughtfully and made no reply.</p>

  <p>"Though I am persecuted," said the man, "though I am wasted by sickness, I
  have felt the call of the Saviour, and I have come to wrestle with you in
  prayer, even as Paul of Tarsus&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gill," said Anthony quietly, "how do you know that you are competent
  to convince me that your way is right and my way is wrong? How do you know
  that I have not as keen a perception of good and evil as you?"</p>

  <p>"There is only one way to the Cross," said the other exultantly, "and that
  is by the most precious blood of the Lord Jesus. 'Wash me and I shall be
  whiter than snow.' The blood of Jesus cleanseth us from all sin.' I come to
  tell you this, though you are my mortal enemy, though you have hounded me
  from my occupation, though you have ruined my home and despoiled it of my
  dear daughter"&mdash;his voice broke&mdash;"yet because Christ laid it upon
  me, to deliver you from the bondage of Satan and lead you to One who hath
  taken the burden of the world, I stand before you a sinner confessed,
  glorifying my Master."</p>

  <p>Still Anthony stood watching him; his keen eyes searching the face of this
  enthusiast. The illogical, inconsequent outburst, with its hackneyed
  phraseology, was less interesting to him than the whole attitude of the man.
  He was transfigured, a being aglow with strange fires.</p>

  <p>"Savonarola in corduroys," thought Anthony, and said aloud, remembering
  the absurdity of arguing with the man:</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you would like to know, Mr. Gill, that Mary is very happy."</p>

  <p>"Happy!" laughed the man, and threw up his imploring hands to heaven.
  "Thou God seest me! To serve Thee, O my Lord, I handed the child of my heart
  to the snare of the harlot and the gilded halls of the wastrel!"</p>

  <p>Anthony was amazed. He had never suspected this man of any affection for
  the girl. Now he saw the anguish on the wasted face, the beads of
  perspiration which stood on his forehead, and realized something of the
  intense mental agony which racked him.</p>

  <p>But in a second Gill had mastered himself.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Manton," he said, quicker than usual, "I have asked my Master to help
  me in my struggle with the powers which you represent. My God is all-powerful
  and all-knowing. He is not mocked! He is greater than kings, most potent of
  Rulers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Anthony listened, all patience as the man went on. In his muddled way he
  had concentrated all the blame for his own misfortune upon that single action
  which had sent him for a month to Bulboro' Jail. Anthony wondered whether he
  would have been so embittered had there been prepared for him such a
  reception as had been offered to Pastor Childe on his release after serving a
  term of imprisonment for non-payment of rates. The young doctor was without
  illusions. To whatever cause Gill might attribute his zeal, in whatever
  divine sources he might see the spring of his inspiration, there was to be
  found a leaven of vanity, sordid, vulgar, commonplace vanity, in Gill's
  speech and action. A vanity such as afflicts sinner and saint alike, if they
  lack the sense of humour and breadth of intelligence to see all round their
  motives.</p>

  <p>It was an absurd waste of time this discussion&mdash;one might as well
  argue with a mountain stream.</p>

  <p>The man sought his levels by the nearest way. He obeyed a law that he had
  created for himself. He saw in Anthony Manton a soul damned almost beyond
  redemption.</p>

  <p>There was no clarity in Gill's view, there was much which was pathetically
  illogical. Thus, Pastor Childe had suggested that prayer might soften the
  hard heart of the persecutor, and Mr. Stope, himself an extremist, had hinted
  that the doctor might be brought to a realization of his unworthiness by
  arguments more subtle than Gill could advance.</p>

  <p>The man was satisfied, however, that Anthony's salvation lay in another
  way. It could only come as a result of Gill's own efforts. He had visualized
  the scene of self-abnegation when Anthony would confess himself before God.
  It is no blasphemy to say that Gill saw God in himself&mdash;he was the
  epitome of a stern and vengeful Being who demanded sacrifice. He thought of
  God as a wasted man with a beard, consumed with the fires of righteous wrath.
  Gill held God's power of attorney&mdash;you could not disabuse him of that
  faith.</p>

  <p>"But, exactly, what do you want me to do?" asked Anthony. "After all, my
  sin seems to have been mainly a personal one as between you and me. Are you
  perfectly satisfied that you are of sufficient importance in the world or out
  of it to excite God's unjustifiable partisanship?"</p>

  <p>Gill drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"Blasphemer!" he rebuked sternly, "our Lord is just and terrible. He is
  not mocked; whatever a man soweth, that also shall he reap."</p>

  <p>"You are an absurd, illogical, unreasonable man," said Anthony, rising
  from the chair in which he had seated himself, "and I am wasting my time with
  you. If God were the thing you think He is, He would be contemptible. Years
  ago, Mr. Gill," he smiled "there was a very clever Frenchman who said that
  God created man after His own image&mdash;and man returned the compliment. I
  do not respect your God&mdash;He is the least attractive of deities. He is
  the God of a diseased and unamiable mind."</p>

  <p>"O Lord, soften this man's heart," groaned Gill.</p>

  <p>"And give you intelligence," said Anthony irritably, as he showed his
  visitor out.</p>

  <p>He was angry with himself that he had displayed any irritation, the more
  so since an indescribable change had come over him of late, a placidity of
  view and a larger benevolence of bearing which enabled him to listen with
  patience to the recital of views which a month or two before would have
  aroused him to an angry interruption.</p>

  <p>He had told himself, with a smile, that he was growing rusty, but as
  against this, his latest contribution to the literature of tropical medicine
  had been received with unstinted praise. One medical journal had even
  detected "an enlargement of view" of Dr. Anthony Manton, to his
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>His life was a very full one. From seven in the morning to nine o'clock at
  night his time was fully occupied. The demands of Bulboro' citizens were
  fairly heavy. It became a fashion to call in Dr. Manton, and so far as it was
  possible to combine a general practice with that of a consultant, he accepted
  the extra work.</p>

  <p>He was above everything an excellent surgeon (for this virtue he was
  regarded with suspicion by his poorer patients), and seldom went astray in
  his diagnosis of disease.</p>

  <p>His quickness to detect and his readiness to operate for certain diseases
  brought into being a new catch-phrase which spread from the club to the slums
  in Bulboro' in an incredibly short space of time.</p>

  <p>It was "This won't hurt you&mdash;and it will do you a lot of good," and
  men who invited one another to drink at the club bar repeated the formula
  with gravity.</p>

  <p>Geraldine Brand found herself repeating the words one day at lunch, and
  Bexley, who was the only other present besides Sir John, laughed.</p>

  <p>"Why do you laugh?" she asked quickly. "Have I been guilty of a
  vulgarism?"</p>

  <p>"In a way&mdash;everybody is using that sentence in town just now; it is
  Manton's favourite phrase."</p>

  <p>She shivered a little, and Sir John shot a sharp glance in her
  direction.</p>

  <p>"Cold, Jerry?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, daddy&mdash;only the words suggest&mdash;it is rather horrid being a
  doctor, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Sir John smiled.</p>

  <p>"It is rather horrid being Manton just now," he said dryly. "There's a
  faction organized against him&mdash;they stoned his car last night going
  through The Chad."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked, startled.</p>

  <p>Her father shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose the blackguards know themselves. Gill is at the bottom of
  the trouble, and he and a few kindred spirits have agreed apparently to put
  our doctor out of Bulboro'&mdash;or to make it so jolly uncomfortable for him
  that he won't stay."</p>

  <p>"I wondered how Manton would get on," said Bexley, nibbling a biscuit
  reflectively. "You see, he doesn't fit in&mdash;he hasn't the <i>suaviter in
  modo</i> either to settle down amongst us or to make himself agreeable to
  people who don't count one way or the other. You see, he's a highly educated
  gentleman with an imagination, and that's an awful handicap to a chap&mdash;a
  simple gentleman can rank himself with his fellows and keep out of the
  low-born's way except to tip him or order him around, but education brings
  you just enough into the other fellow's line of vision to enable you to see
  how badly he is situated and to feel wild that he doesn't help himself out of
  it in the way which is obvious to everybody except the victim."</p>

  <p>"Have you any imagination, Bexley?" asked Sir John.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Sir John," said Bexley, "I'm a Junior Lord of the Treasury."</p>

  <p>Sir John laughed.</p>

  <p>"You are almost wasted on the Cabinet," he said. "You always remind me of
  those adventurous devils one meets in Algeria&mdash;by Jove!"</p>

  <p>"Have you forgotten an appointment, daddy?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>Sir John shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;but I have been wondering where I had seen a man like Manton
  before. There was a sergeant of the Foreign Legion I met in Algeria eight
  years ago&mdash;a boyish, pleasant young man who was obviously an Englishman.
  I met him," said Sir John reminiscently, "when I was&mdash;er&mdash;taking a
  vacation."</p>

  <p>Bexley smiled to himself.</p>

  <p>"He came to the hotel with a message for the Colonel of the Chasseurs
  d'Afrique&mdash;let me think&mdash;yes&mdash;he was a young medical man; I
  remember the Colonel telling me. Now I wonder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bexley nodded.</p>

  <p>"That was Manton," he said. "He spent two years in the Foreign
  Legion."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked the girl in surprise. "I thought only people who had got into
  trouble joined the Legion.'</p>

  <p>"Manton didn't get into trouble," smiled Lord Bexley; "but he went in his
  deliberate way to become acclimatized and to make a man of himself&mdash;he
  told me that in those words when I was on the Congo."</p>

  <p>"Tell me some more about him," said Geraldine.</p>

  <p>Bexley looked at her strangely, and she felt herself go red and was angry
  that she had said anything which might suggest that she took more than a
  passing interest in this uncomfortable doctor. She remembered, too, Bexley's
  ridiculous question concerning the doctor and herself.</p>

  <p>"Please don't be horrid, Bexley," she said severely. "I am interested in
  this young man, and I have grown so provincial from living in Bulboro' that
  to pretend any lack of curiosity where Dr. Manton is concerned would be
  monstrous."</p>

  <p>"There is very little to tell about him," Bexley reflected. "He was always
  a very quiet man, one never got really to the inside of his mind, because he
  devoted all his time and most of his conversation to malarial-bearing
  insects. He is an excellent surgeon, rather unusual in a bacteriologist, and
  he was very popular with the natives. That is all I know about Anthony."</p>

  <p>The girl was silent, then:</p>

  <p>"Do you think that the explanation he offered for joining the Foreign
  Legion was quite a true one?" she asked. Bexley raised his eyebrows in
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't it be?"</p>

  <p>"But really, don't people"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"don't people join
  that regiment in&mdash;in desperation?"</p>

  <p>"I don't quite follow you," said the other.</p>

  <p>"She has been reading <i>Ouida</i>," said Sir John, "and scents the story
  of a young gentleman who kills another young gentleman, and dashes off to the
  Foreign Legion&mdash;falls in love with a vivandiere and is romantically
  rescued by a young lady garbed in a short skirt and a barrel of coyness."</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly, daddy," she protested. "But isn't it a fact that few
  people join the Foreign Legion unless there is some sinister reason for their
  enlistment?"</p>

  <p>Bexley shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've a dim idea that men do enlist because they have trouble with their
  parents or are disappointed in love, or something of that sort, but Anthony
  had no trouble with his parents; his father was very, very fond of him. Old
  Sir Guy Manton was a brilliant surgeon and very rich, and Anthony went into
  the Foreign Legion with his full consent. As to being disappointed in love, I
  cannot imagine Anthony Manton being in love under any circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she asked.</p>

  <p>There was something in her tone which made Bexley stare at her.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he repeated. "Well, he is not a particularly lovable gentleman,
  is he?"</p>

  <p>"I am not taking my point of view," she said quickly. "It is possible that
  I may not think him very lovable or very bearable, but I am only seeking to
  get a man's view of another man. Why is he not lovable? Tell me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, for heaven's sake, tell her something," said Sir John impatiently.
  "And do in future, Jerry, keep your psychological discussions until I am out
  of the way. If there is one thing I loathe more than another," he went on,
  "it is to be an unwilling witness, and an unwilling audience at these
  motive-vivisections. It always gives me an uncomfortable feeling that people
  discuss me in exactly the same way."</p>

  <p>The girl smiled faintly, but her attention was on Bexley. For some reason
  or other she wanted information on a subject which had occupied her mind of
  late. Bexley's reference to Anthony's unpopularity was a cause for worry.
  Anthony Manton was nothing whatever to her; she could not regard herself as
  being even remotely the keeper of his conscience, but she had sought very
  fairly and very disinterestedly, so she told herself, for an explanation, and
  could find no other reason for the scowls which met his grey motor-car as it
  passed through The Chad, for the imprecations which were hurled after him as
  he walked in the streets of Bulboro', than the fact that he had identified
  himself as one who was actively opposed to Bulboro's main interest.</p>

  <p>Even the least godly of the town's inhabitants took a pride in the
  religious spirit of the place. There is on record the notorious instance of
  Montague Silver, a well-known and indescribable sinner, who had canvassed
  every public-house in the neighbouring town of Merton, challenging all and
  sundry who might question Bulboro's sanctity to fight him on the public
  highway.</p>

  <p>That Silver was drunk only emphasizes more strongly how and to what
  strange lengths spiritual pride may go. Silver, that drunken printer, had
  profited by his championship, spiritually and materially, for his conversion,
  no less than his truculence, had proved one of the sensations of a year in
  which wandering revivalists had wrought many miracles in Bulboro'.</p>

  <p>Anthony had offended the town in its most tender spot, and though the
  Bulboro' folk, and especially the poorer classes, came to him for succour,
  and though his work was rather on the increase than otherwise, and his
  reputation as a skilled surgeon had grown from day to day, there existed
  undoubtedly a strong feeling of antagonism against him.</p>

  <p>Anthony had sent the girl a charming little note in acknowledgment of her
  portrait, and there seemed a possibility that they would become more closely
  acquainted, though in a manner which Geraldine of all people did not
  desire.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the conversation, there had occurred something which had
  possibly done much to keep the talk in the direction of Pilgrim's Rest and
  its unlovable occupant!</p>

  <p>Geraldine had risen at her ordinary time, had her bath, and was sitting
  before her glass arranging her hair with the assistance of her maid, when she
  had been attacked with a pain of extraordinary poignancy, a pain which was so
  sudden, so unexpected, that for a moment she thought she was stabbed in the
  side. The maid saw the girl's face go suddenly pale, and had caught her in
  her arms as she fell backward swooning. Worse than this, she had, after she
  had laid her young mistress on the bed, gone for Sir John Brand, and Sir John
  had come in his dressing-gown in a flurry of anxiety.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing," said the girl. She was smiling and sitting up when he
  arrived. "Nothing more romantic than a growing-pain."</p>

  <p>"You look pretty rotten, Jerry," said Sir John fretfully; "you had better
  see the doctor.'</p>

  <p>"Which doctor?" she asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"Anthony Manton."</p>

  <p>"I will do nothing of the kind, daddy," she said firmly. She was in an
  unaccountable panic. "I beg of you not to send for him&mdash;if you do I
  shall be very ill. There is no more the matter with me than there is with
  your own dear, silly self."</p>

  <p>Sir John would have overridden his daughter's wishes, but she had made
  such a quick recovery, and he hated anything that had the appearance of
  unnecessary fuss.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, whilst the girl was working out the trouble of the doctor's
  unpopularity, Sir John made his way to Pilgrim's Rest, and was fortunate
  enough to find Anthony at home.</p>

  <p>"It is probably nothing," said Anthony after Sir John had given an
  entirely unsatisfactory and inaccurate description of his daughter's
  symptoms. "It sounds very much like prosaic indigestion, but I will not speak
  to her about it. I quite understand her desire to have some other doctor," he
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"It isn't that," said Sir John hurriedly. "My dear chap, she never
  suggested anybody else."</p>

  <p>"Still, I think an older man would be better," said Anthony. "Get
  Grimthorpe; he is fairly sound, and he is old enough to inspire confidence in
  Miss Brand."</p>

  <p>"What do you think it is?" asked Sir John anxiously. Anthony smiled.</p>

  <p>"It is most difficult to give you any opinion," he said, "but I should
  imagine it was just what Miss Brand suggested, a sharp attack of indigestion,
  which will, in all probability, pass off without leaving any
  consequences."</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Jerry had been vague as to the location of the pain, and
  there was very little to go upon, but what Sir John had described did not in
  any way alarm the doctor.</p>

  <p>"I shall be going over to Paris in a day or two," said Anthony, by way of
  making conversation and changing the subject from Geraldine's indisposition,
  "and Grimthorpe is looking after my practice while I am away."</p>

  <p>"What is this&mdash;a holiday jaunt?"</p>

  <p>Anthony smiled.</p>

  <p>"No, not exactly," he said dryly; "there is a rather interesting fly which
  has been sent from the Congo to the College of Medicine, and which I am
  anxious to see; also I am going to meet Lady Heron Wendall, who is coming
  back from Chamonix. She is going on to Nice, but she has asked me to meet her
  at Paris."</p>

  <p>"What is happening there?" asked Sir John interestedly. "I hear no news
  whatever except that Heron Wendall is leaving the diocese and another chap is
  taking his place."</p>

  <p>"That is by no means certain as far as I can gather," replied Anthony.
  "The bishop is not at all keen on allowing Heron Wendall to go. You see, the
  man who takes this living has a pretty tough row to hoe, and unless Heron
  Wendall is going to retire from the Church altogether, I do not see exactly
  what advantage there is in him leaving Bulboro'. England is a very small
  place, and these stories get round."</p>

  <p>"You are taking almost an enthusiastic interest in the Church," said Sir
  John, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I am," said Anthony thoughtfully, "but if one does not take an
  interest in some church or other in Bulboro', and if one does not also play
  golf, there seems to be no reason in the world why one should be alive."</p>

  <p>Sir John was half-way down the hill when Anthony ran after him
  bareheaded.</p>

  <p>"If there is any more trouble with Miss Brand," he said, "I wish you would
  let me know."</p>

  <p>"You mean let Dr. Grimthorpe know?" asked Sir John. Anthony shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "let me know also, please."</p>

  <p>"You are a rum devil," said Sir John.</p>

  <p>"Am I not?" replied Anthony innocently; and Sir John noted with amusement
  that there was a little more colour in his face than the east wind or the
  exercise of running twenty yards could excuse.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">XIV. &mdash; A POSTCARD FROM PARIS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In Pembridge Street, Bulboro', there dwelt Montague Silver.
  There are people who say that Monty was of a faith that gathered on Saturday
  morning in a little Synagogue built by Ambrose Cohen on one corner of his
  town estate. But as to this Mr. Cohen himself was doubtful. There were
  Silvers and Montagues&mdash;who had no trace of Hebraic blood in their veins.
  And certainly there was nothing about Montague Silver himself to suggest that
  he had descended from Jewish stock. He was a Very short man, and at one time
  had been immensely fat. Now, however, that distressing affliction had been
  removed from him; not without some unhappy consequence to his personal
  appearance.</p>

  <p>He was a printer in a fair way of business, but there was a time when
  Montague had been a reproach to the town of Bulboro', when his little
  printing plant worked secretly in the night to produce illegal lottery
  tickets for Continental firms, football coupons for bookmakers who were
  situated in Flushing, and when, too, there had in fact been no illegal work
  which a printer might not do that he had not done for profit.</p>

  <p>Twice he had been raided by the police and heavily fined, but he continued
  his guilty way with a cynical disregard for the feelings of his shocked and
  outraged fellow-citizens.</p>

  <p>This was not his only drawback in the eyes of respectable people, for
  Montague Silver was a notorious bibber of wine, or to be more exact, if less
  poetical, of four-ale. And in his cups he was, though small of stature, a
  terrible man, a breaker of windows on The Chad, a challenger of tall
  policemen, and a loud and strident offender possessed of a vocabulary which
  was neither wholesome nor gentle.</p>

  <p>This was years ago, before the revival meetings, when there had come to
  the town a most fiery young man with a mop of hair and a silvery tongue who
  had produced spiritual earthquakes.</p>

  <p>Not the least of his conquests had been Montague, who responded alike to
  the eloquence of the revivalist and to the solicitations of those customers
  whom he did not wish to offend, for he had a legitimate business besides that
  from which he drew a large portion of his income.</p>

  <p>He had paid a visit to the chapel, and was miraculously converted. Yet his
  conversion was not an immediate one. It is on record that he negotiated for
  the printing of at least three Christian societies, that he secured the
  private orders of a number of influential Wesleyans, and that he did obtain
  fairly adequate compensation for the Continental trade he must necessarily
  abandon before he came to a true condition of penitence. This is not told
  against the religious bodies which helped the man to a more sober and a more
  commendable life, rather is it told against Montague Silver, who above all
  things was a business man.</p>

  <p>It was said of him that he was a humbug; probably the description was
  justified. At any rate, if he was a humbug he was a good craftsman, and there
  is no reason in the world why he should not have had a large share of
  Bulboro's printing, though necessarily the <i>Herald</i>, with its up-to-date
  plant, secured the bulk of the orders that were going. The <i>Herald</i>
  devoted columns to all the churches, irrespective of creed, and artfully gave
  them alphabetical preference, thus securing a large share of business from
  saint and sinner alike.</p>

  <p>There was quite enough remaining, however, to keep Mr. Montague Silver
  very busy. He picked up more than the unconsidered trifles, and on more
  occasions than one, the <i>Herald</i> had fought strenuously in competition
  for some of the orders Montague had secured. If Montague Silver's tenders
  were higher, there was the indisputable fact that he was of, and in, many of
  the movements to the furtherance of which printing was required. That his
  shiny bald head was to be seen just topping the pew at their Sunday services,
  and that high above the pleasant rumble of the singing congregation of the
  Baptist Church might be heard the shrill falsetto of one who had gained no
  little reputation in the old days for his rendering of "White Wings."</p>

  <p>He was sitting in his shop on a Saturday afternoon reading the <i>Bulboro'
  Herald</i> column of advertisements relating to its plant and its facilities
  for carrying out of printing work in the most prompt and effective manner,
  and was reading it, moreover, with a most unchristian-like sneer upon his
  creased face, when Gill called upon him. Montague folded up the paper and
  rose.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, brother Gill?" he asked politely. He had a harsh voice,
  the result of overmuch indulgence. It had that peculiar husky quality to
  which it was pleasant to listen. There was in his attitude a bland and open
  acknowledgment of his former sins. He would speak of his disreputable past
  both in private and in public (for he was one of the Street League) without
  shame and with something of enjoyment. Whatever pride he might have in his
  sinless present seemed to be eclipsed by the improper pride he had in his
  unrepentant past. The one sorrow which religion had brought to him was to be
  found in the necessity&mdash;since the necessity apparently existed&mdash;for
  donning a collar and a tie. Mr. Silver said that during the greater portion
  of his forty-five years of vice he had never worn a collar except on the
  occasion of his wife's funeral, a day which he always looked back upon with
  resentment for that reason.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the memory of that rasping edge about his ears had outlived the
  recollection of the faded woman who had suffered matrimony at his hands.</p>

  <p>"I want to see you," said Gill calmly, "on a matter of business."</p>

  <p>Monty looked at him over his glasses.</p>

  <p>"To see me, brother Gill," he said in mild surprise.</p>

  <p>Was it the printing account of the Brotherhood, or was it the possibly
  excessive bill which he had put in to cover the cost of production of a
  wholly unnecessary balance sheet issued by the Street League, which had
  brought this ominous visitation?</p>

  <p>Apparently it was neither, for Gill made no reference to the exorbitant
  charges, and the pricking conscience of Mr. Monty Silver was soothed.</p>

  <p>"Can I see you privately?" asked Gill.</p>

  <p>His manner of talking was a little brusque. He had no kindliness even to
  those outside his own family; a dour, ungenial man, he excited no feeling of
  friendliness even amongst the men who respected him for the sincerity of his
  opinions. To Montague Silver he was especially obnoxious, yet the converted
  printer lived in some fear of the man who had been more than any other
  responsible for his discovery of grace.</p>

  <p>There were passages in Silver's life which in a moment of contrition he
  had confided to Gill, and which in a less chastened moment he had regretted,
  that placed him to some extent in the other's power. Gill knew too much, and
  was not above implying that he had not forgotten all that he had learnt.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, you can see me privately," said Mr. Silver courteously, and
  led the way to his inner parlour. He lived alone, an old woman tending to his
  needs in the morning and cleaning up the two rooms which formed his living
  apartments. The little back parlour was cosily furnished, for Montague had
  carried with him to his new life something of his old taste for comfort.</p>

  <p>Gill closed the door himself, and walking to the little door which
  communicated with the kitchen, opened it and looked out.</p>

  <p>"There is nobody there," said Mr. Silver, rather surprised.</p>

  <p>It was reminiscent of the old days, when the agents of the Continental
  bookmakers came to make secret arrangements for their printing, and when
  every footstep which passed the closed door of the shop had brought a silence
  to the conspirators. Gill walked slowly back and stood by the table, looking
  down at Mr. Silver, for the printer never knelt when he could stand, or stood
  when it was possible to sit.</p>

  <p>"My brother," said Gill with that sharp, acid brusqueness of his, "in the
  days of long ago, before you found salvation, you did many things and took
  many risks for the devil."</p>

  <p>"That is quite true, brother," agreed Mr. Silver cheerfully. He never
  thought unkindly of the devil, who was associated in his mind with many happy
  days and nights, and his mental attitude to the enemy of mankind was of that
  respectful admiration which the petty thief reserves for the successful
  robber.</p>

  <p>"Now I want you to take a risk for the salvation of a human soul, for the
  cleansing of one impure of heart, and for the glory of our God."</p>

  <p>Mr. Silver looked at him narrowly. His mind ran to print naturally, and he
  saw only in the outburst the prospect of a new commission. "What do you
  mean?" he said, without seeing anything of the kind.</p>

  <p>Gill did not explain for a moment what he meant, then:</p>

  <p>"All the powers of darkness are arrayed against the efforts of any single
  man who desires only the salvation and the upraising of sinful humanity. I
  have sent a number of letters to the Editor of the
  <i>Herald</i>&mdash;letters which it would have been well for him to have
  printed," he said.</p>

  <p>"I see," said Mr. Silver, with a wise inclination of his head.</p>

  <p>Gill paced the apartment restlessly, his nervous hands clasping and
  unclasping. "What has been told to the few must be told to the many. God
  breaks the hardened heart and brings it in sorrow to righteousness."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Montague, beginning to see daylight. "Something in long
  primer, Mr. Gill?" he ventured. "Something on that new blue paper we have
  got? A good idea, I think. White tracts ain't much use&mdash;I'm always
  tellin' our dear friends: what you want is a bit of colour."</p>

  <p>He was vague as to what Gill was driving at, but had smelt a tract. He had
  made a bid for the printing of tracts, but the local societies had found it
  easier to buy their literature from headquarters. It was much cheaper, and
  they were relieved from the responsibility of authorship.</p>

  <p>"I have got a range of new blocks," he went on; "poor boys crying in the
  snow, little gels feeding the birds, angels hovering over beds, a regular job
  line I bought in London last year. Or," he went on slowly, pursuing a
  pleasant thought, "something about the devil. I have got one or two devils
  that have never been seen before. There ain't enough devils nowadays," said
  Mr. Silver, shaking his head mournfully. "When I was a boy you couldn't get
  away from him; now you can hardly see him mentioned. I've got a two-colour
  devil that I bought from Hatuns, red an' black; very effective, too. It
  doesn't cost much more to have a bit of colour on a tract, an' if you have
  colour you can always run a red border round it which makes it ever so much
  more genteel," he suggested enticingly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gill shook his head.</p>

  <p>"This is not a tract," he said; "it is a great revelation, a soul-searing,
  heart-breaking revelation."</p>

  <p>He sat down, and, talking rapidly, he sketched the story of Lady Heron
  Wendall's sin. He produced copies of the letters he had addressed to the
  Editor of the <i>Bulboro' Herald</i>, and Mr. Silver took them reluctantly,
  adjusted his glasses, and read them.</p>

  <p>When he had finished he folded the letters up and handed them back.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "this ain't a tract, this is libel."</p>

  <p>"Well, what of it?" demanded Gill impatiently. "What do I care what the
  world may call it? What do I care what punishment may come to me so long as I
  can only bring a hardened soul to the seat of grace?"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk about the punishment that would come to you," begged Mr.
  Silver. "They wouldn't touch you&mdash;they'd pinch me!"</p>

  <p>"You have taken this risk before," said Gill severely. "You have done
  things which are vile and abominable in the eyes of God, and you have done
  these to serve the creatures of the devil."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Mr. Silver convincingly; "but that was before I found
  grace."</p>

  <p>He said this with emphasis and meaning. "Before I found grace," he
  repeated. "Now I know what's right and what's wrong&mdash;thanks be!" And he
  raised his eyes to the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"No," he went on regretfully, "I couldn't print this for you, Mr. Gill; it
  would be against my conscience and against the law; and I should get nothing
  out of it anyway. After all," he said, "a man has got to live."</p>

  <p>"Four years ago, Mr. Silver," said Gill sternly, "you did something which
  was more risky than this."</p>

  <p>Mr. Silver wriggled uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"Don't go throwing that up into my face, brother; that was before I had
  realized the error of my ways."</p>

  <p>"A receiver of stolen property, my brother," said Gill grimly, "may well
  see the error of his ways."</p>

  <p>Mr. Silver looked at him through his narrow eyes, and Gill was at that
  moment nearer to being violently assaulted than he had ever been in his
  life.</p>

  <p>The printer had been a man of some pugilistic quality before the days of
  his conversion, and he was no less formidable now.</p>

  <p>But with an effort he restrained his natural desire to express his sense
  of resentment in the easiest way.</p>

  <p>Gill stood for business&mdash;and business was business. "Leave them with
  me," he grumbled at last. "I suppose I shall have to do it for you."</p>

  <p>He took the letters from Gill and put them away in a cupboard.</p>

  <p>How would it do to shove in a couple of blanks in place of the name? "he
  suggested as a last endeavour to relieve himself of responsibility.</p>

  <p>"That letter must be published as it is," said Gill sternly, "every name,
  including mine; I will stand the consequences."</p>

  <p>"You don't want devils or anything on it?" asked Mr. Silver, delicately
  satirical, "or an old man resting on a heap of stones and a young gel giving
  him food, nothing about faith' or hope or charity?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Gill did not wait to continue the discussion, and with a curt nod he
  made his way out through the shop into the street, and Silver followed him to
  the door and stood gazing after him as he made his way along the narrow
  street which led to The Chad.</p>

  <p>"You'll be a nice bloke to have knocking about in heaven, you will," said
  Mr. Silver to the retreating figure, and added, "I don't think!"</p>

  <p>But Gill was superior to human judgment; he had found a mission in life
  for himself, and his release from regular employment gave him greater
  opportunity for carrying his plans into, effect.</p>

  <p>He had been a frugal man and had saved money during the many years he had
  been employed on Sir John Brand's estate, and there was no fear as to his
  immediate future. Moreover, his friends and admirers gave him odd jobs to do
  which ensured a steady if smaller income than that to which he had been
  accustomed. He had money in the Post Office Savings Bank, and money invested
  in a building society. He had been frugal to a point of meanness, and was one
  of those fortunate men who pride themselves upon their justice, meaning that
  he measured exactly the favours he bestowed and took for granted the charity
  he received.</p>

  <p>Anthony Manton, who was utterly oblivious of the comparative prosperity of
  Gill, had been considerably exercised when he learned that Sir John had
  dismissed the man from his employment. He felt indirectly responsible for
  Gill's future, and whilst he did not feel called upon to offer advice to Sir
  John concerning the man's employment, he used his personal influence in the
  direction of securing Gill adequate employment.</p>

  <p>The day before he left London for Paris he called Jocks into his study and
  informed him of his intended trip.</p>

  <p>"I shall only be away for a few days," he said, "and there are one or two
  things that I would like you to do in my absence. The side gate leading on to
  the road needs a new panel, some of the windows could do with repair, and
  there are half a dozen other jobs need doing which I have. Whilst I am away I
  want you to get the man Gill and let him do as much as he can in four
  days."</p>

  <p>"That doorway in your study, sir, ought to be made draught-proof,"
  suggested Jocks. "Dr. Manton used to complain about it. Of course he didn't
  use it very much&mdash;he found it rather inconvenient. My own opinion, sir,"
  ventured Jocks, "is that it would be as well to have that side door fastened
  up altogether, because you don't use it."</p>

  <p>"When I want," began Anthony, and then checked himself. "I do not quite
  agree with you," he said.</p>

  <p>It was not exactly what he had intended saying, but his training was
  bearing fruit, and he smiled as he used the amended phrase.</p>

  <p>"Do you intend taking Ahmet, sir?" asked Jocks respectfully.</p>

  <p>"No, he can stay, if you promise me that you will not allow the people of
  Bulboro' to convert him."</p>

  <p>Mr. Jocks did not even smile.</p>

  <p>"That is outside my province, sir."</p>

  <p>Anthony's brows met, but again he stopped the sharp word that rose to his
  lips. "I will confine myself to your province," he said humorously, "which in
  this case is the scheme of repairs necessary to the house. My address, by the
  way, will be the Hôtel Gerible."</p>

  <p>Jocks made a laborious note.</p>

  <p>"And I shall be back on Saturday afternoon. Have you ever been to Paris,
  Jocks?" he asked as he settled himself to his desk.</p>

  <p>"Me, sir?" said Mr. Jocks, a little shocked. "No, sir, I have never been
  to Paris."</p>

  <p>His disclaimer was very definite, and he spoke with the air of one who was
  rather grateful than otherwise that he had not endured such an experience.
  Anthony looked up quickly with a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"You seem to be rather congratulating yourself, Jocks, that you have
  missed that adventure?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," said Mr. Jocks, drawing a long breath. "Paris by all accounts
  is not a place where a God-fearing man can live. There are certain things
  about Paris which I will not pollute your ear with, sir."</p>

  <p>"Do not worry," said Anthony dryly. "It takes a great deal to pollute the
  ears of a medical man. I presume you mean that Paris is wholly given over to
  the pursuit of pleasure of a dubious kind."</p>

  <p>"So I understand, sir," said Mr. Jocks gravely. "I have read several books
  on the subject, such as the <i>Night Life of Paris</i>, and one or two other
  books which I am happy to say I destroyed."</p>

  <p>"It is very curious," said Anthony half to himself.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jocks would have liked to have known what was so curious. He had an
  impression that his employer had formed an opinion of him which was not
  exactly complimentary. In this he was right. Jocks was a member of a social
  grade which had strict and settled views upon such matters as national
  characteristics.</p>

  <p>He knew, of course, that the Parisians were immensely immoral, that
  Germans loved sausages, and that Italians ate macaroni. He also was aware of
  the fact that the Spaniards were very fiery people who killed one another on
  the slightest pretext, and that Russia was a land where people threw bombs,
  and were sent to Siberia. For the rest, the world was made up of India, the
  Colonies, and America, the latter being a place whither people fled when they
  desired to avoid arrest; such an experience having happened to Mr. Jocks in
  his own family, though he never discussed it for reasons of family pride.</p>

  <p>The French woman, to Mr. Jocks, was an object of curiosity. He regarded
  her as immoral from birth, with lax views on the sanctity of marriage if she
  ever got married at all.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jocks had on one occasion expressed surprise that such people should
  ever go through the formality of a wedding service. And he was only one of
  many thousands who, despite the broadening and enlightening influence of
  popular education and the subsequent growth of new forms of healthy
  literature, held similar views.</p>

  <p>Anthony left for Paris the next morning, and found to his surprise that he
  had a pleasant travelling companion, as far as London at any rate, in Mr.
  Ambrose Cohen, who was paying one of his periodical visits to town.</p>

  <p>They stood on the platform chatting until the train came in, and then had
  the good fortune to find a first-class smoker to themselves.</p>

  <p>"I am following your progress with a great deal of interest," said the
  little man, those dancing eyes of his watching the other with apparent
  amusement. "You have succeeded more completely than I could have imagined in
  setting Bulboro' by the ears."</p>

  <p>Anthony smiled ruefully.</p>

  <p>"It is very curious, isn't it? And I am an individual who hates publicity,
  and loathes anything in the nature of a sensation.'</p>

  <p>"You have not been very tactful," said the other, shaking his head; "and I
  rather fancy a little self-righteous."</p>

  <p>Anthony looked at the little man in amazement. If the other had told him
  that he had been intemperate of habit and uncleanly of life, Anthony could
  not have been more astounded.</p>

  <p>"Self-righteous?" he repeated incredulously.</p>

  <p>"I think that is the word I should apply," said Ambrose thoughtfully. "I
  cannot think of another which is quite as inoffensive."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to suggest that I have been rather a prig&mdash;don't mind
  saying so," said Anthony with a smile. "I am taking quite a wholesome
  interest in myself."</p>

  <p>"A healthy sign," said Ambrose. "You see, there is always a danger that a
  man who has seen much more of the world than his less fortunate fellows will
  get things almost as much out of proportion as the stay-at-home clod, who
  never stirs outside the town's limits That is the point of view which I think
  will rather appeal to you as a scientific man."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said Anthony slowly. "Of course, I took it for granted that
  all these people were on another plane to myself&mdash;yes, and that plane
  was a lower one."</p>

  <p>Ambrose laughed.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps there are no lower planes," suggested Cohen. "That all the planes
  are set without regard to priority. I never think of 'planes' when I am
  sizing up the creatures of the world, but rather of that big filing cabinet
  in my study. It is filled with hundreds of folders, none of which have
  priority of importance, but each of which contains some more or less
  important factor in my everyday life. It would be absurd for the contents of
  one envelope to be contemptuous of the contents of another&mdash;absurd and a
  little pitiable."</p>

  <p>"You think I am a little too keen on the exclusiveness of my folder?"
  asked Anthony, interested, and the other nodded.</p>

  <p>Anthony felt just a little irritated.</p>

  <p>"I rather like your lecture, Cohen," he said. "Considering that you were
  my first guide to the eccentricities of Bulboro'."</p>

  <p>"I told you to keep yourself away from the churches," said Ambrose, with
  that little laugh of his, "instead of which you went along and dumped
  yourself into the middle of every religious controversy which existed. You
  are the worst pupil I ever had," he said admiringly; "and certainly the best
  doctor. Where do you go now?"</p>

  <p>He changed the conversation, seeing that Anthony was not in the mood for
  anything that bore the slightest resemblance to criticism.</p>

  <p>"I am going over to Paris," said the doctor. "I suppose you are not
  journeying my way?"</p>

  <p>"I shall come with you as far as Calais," said Ambrose. "I am going on to
  Liège and from there to Amsterdam. Our friend Gill is somewhat interested in
  foreign cities, by the way," he said as the thought occurred to him suddenly,
  "he came up to see me the other day, and asked in a very mysterious way for
  exact information as to how one might get to Chamonix."</p>

  <p>Anthony's brows met in a frown.</p>

  <p>"I hope he is not going to bother those people," he said.</p>

  <p>"I don't know which people you are referring to," said Ambrose; "but if it
  is Lady Heron Wendall I should imagine from one or two remarks he dropped
  that that was his intention. However," smiled the little Hebrew, "I think it
  very unlikely that he will go; he was simply appalled when I took down my
  Bradshaw and discovered the fare."</p>

  <p>Anthony nodded.</p>

  <p>"I doubt very much whether he will leave England," he said. "It is perhaps
  as well that he does not know that Lady Heron Wendall is in Paris."</p>

  <p>It happened, however, that on that very afternoon Mary Heron Wendall,
  elated at the unusual experience of an ascent to the second stage of the
  Eiffel Tower, sent off a number of postcards to people to announce her
  accomplishment. One of these cards, with the Eiffel Tower postmark, revealing
  the great engineering achievement on one side, was addressed to Dr. Anthony
  Manton; and John Gill, engaged in fitting the doctor's study door, recognized
  the handwriting, and caught a glimpse of the picture on the card. Even he, no
  less than Mr. Jocks, knew the Eiffel Tower was in Paris, and that Paris was,
  according to all the railway advertisements, within seven hours' journey from
  London.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">XV. &mdash; MISSING DOCUMENTS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There is an hour of the day when Paris hesitates between the
  red and gold of the sky, and the twinkle of lights in her streets, as though
  in doubt which form of illumination would serve her best.</p>

  <p>Then it is that the city is at her darkest; her Opera House like a squat
  giant wedding-cake, all prickly with trimmings, sits in placid gloom against
  the sunset, and offers no solution to the problem which Paris must worry out
  for herself.</p>

  <p>Darker grows the sky, there is a deeper gold, more livid red in the west,
  and a richer blue in the east, and Paris decides hurriedly.</p>

  <p>Suddenly from one end of the city to the other the street lights dawn in a
  brilliant and unexpected blaze.</p>

  <p>Vast yellow lights, cold white lights, lights that twinkle or blaze
  furiously in electric signs, lights that glow sedately in <i>magazin</i>
  windows, all come flickering and glowing together. Even the Rue de la Paix
  cannot show so gorgeous a rope of brilliants as that which bedecks the street
  itself. The whole body of the congregation of the Senate, brilliant in
  another sense, must stand abashed before the sedate congress of illumination
  which throngs the Place de la Concorde.</p>

  <p>Alone, and punctuating the irresponsible glitter of light yellow and warm
  red, are the soft green lamps showing the Arrêt Stations, where the buses
  will stop on demand.</p>

  <p>A soothing light, thought Anthony, as he strolled from the Scrib and
  turned into the Boulevard des Italiens smoking a reflective cigar. Paris was
  at its best at this hour, for there is no garish blaze of arc-lamps that
  other cities know. The lights of Paris are soft and harmonious, and before
  all things immensely soothing. He walked slowly, for he had plenty of time
  before him, and at every few yards he found something to hold his attention.
  He had spent the afternoon profitably at the College of Medicines, where he
  enjoyed some little fame, making microscopic examinations of a new variety of
  tsetse fly which an exploring <i>savant</i> had found on the Sangar Rides,
  and to the satisfaction of a good dinner was added that of a good conscience
  at a day well spent.</p>

  <p>Lady Heron Wendall had arrived that afternoon, and was staying at the
  Bristol, and he had telephoned making an appointment with her. He found the
  night cold; he made this discovery when he was taking his coffee outside the
  De la Paix, and walked back to the hotel for his overcoat and found a
  telegram was waiting for him; it had arrived after he had left the hotel. He
  opened the blue envelope, expecting to read an inquiry from his locum tenens.
  He read the wire and jumped.</p>

  <p>It was dated Bulboro', and had been handed in at six o'clock. "I hope you
  will enjoy your holiday. Will you please keep in touch with us if you leave
  Paris?"</p>

  <p>It was signed "Geraldine Brand."</p>

  <p>He read the telegram again. It was the most unexpected thing that had ever
  happened to him in his life. Why Geraldine Brand should take the trouble to
  wire him he could not understand, and why he should keep in touch with her
  was no less beyond his comprehension.</p>

  <p>She had procured his address from Jocks, he gathered. But why? Here was
  food for thought&mdash;a little mystery which defied his unravelling.</p>

  <p>He put the slip in his pocket and went out again, and making his way
  across the road to the Rue de la Paix, walked slowly down to the Bristol.</p>

  <p>The Bristol is one of the most sedate of the Parisian hotels. It stands in
  the Place Vendôme, and is a popular hostelry with members of the British
  aristocracy.</p>

  <p>Mary had gone to bed when he arrived. Lady Heron Wendall received him in
  her sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"It is awfully good of you to come," she said, shaking hands warmly. "It
  is unpardonable of me to bring you here, but there are so many things I want
  to talk to you about, and I know nobody else in Bulboro', no, no." She shook
  her head laughingly. "There is really nobody else with whom I could discuss
  them."</p>

  <p>Edward had seen the bishop apparently, and the bishop had advised a long
  holiday for both Edward and his wife, and a return to Bulboro' at its
  conclusion. To this course Edward had agreed for many reasons, not the least
  of which had been furnished by the sympathy which had been extended to him by
  the county.</p>

  <p>"He is a wonderful man, really," she mused. "He has a whole reservoir of
  loving kindness underneath that curious manner of his which has so irritated
  me for fourteen years."</p>

  <p>She smiled at Anthony.</p>

  <p>"I can say that to you because you will understand," she added. "I
  suggested that he should go back alone," she went on, "but he very properly
  refused, and it was rather selfish of me to suggest that course, because it
  would have made people talk. At any rate, he will be alone for six months,
  and the separation will do neither of us any great harm."</p>

  <p>Lady Heron Wendall had the trick of retaining an impression of youthful
  freshness, and now as Anthony saw her in the black chiffon velvet gown, with
  its little edging of skunk, and its low-cut bodice, he smiled at the thought
  that this was the mother of a girl of sixteen. She looked twenty-five, and
  not a day older. Care had passed her over, and if the cheeks had sunk a
  little it only created that sense of ethereal and delicate beauty which was
  an attraction rather than a reproach.</p>

  <p>She had a way of gesticulating which he had often noticed before; her
  hands were eloquent of her thoughts when she was easy in her mind as to the
  friendliness of her audience.</p>

  <p>All the drawl and the fine lady air had dropped away from her; she was a
  very human and lovable woman, Anthony thought.</p>

  <p>"There is one other thing I want to speak about," she said; "and that
  perhaps the most important," she smiled. "You remember you gave me this key
  to go to a cupboard in your study."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have only availed myself once of the privilege&mdash;probably you are
  unaware that I went even once. I took the box out, but I could not endure the
  strain of a very complete examination."</p>

  <p>Her voice quivered a little, then she was silent. After a while she
  recovered her self-control.</p>

  <p>"There are a number of letters there, as you know, and two little diaries
  in which he speaks of me. I intended taking them away, but I left Bulboro' in
  such a hurry that I had not time, and I want you to be so kind, Anthony
  Manton, to send them to me."</p>

  <p>"With all the pleasure in life," said Anthony in surprise. "If you had
  written I should have been most happy&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I know," she said hastily. "I have been very, very selfish to send for
  you."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he said laughingly. "I am glad of the opportunity to get
  away from Bulboro'."</p>

  <p>"Somehow I wanted an excuse for seeing you. Isn't that a selfish
  confession?"</p>

  <p>"It is a very flattering one," he said, with his quiet smile. "I must
  confess I have enjoyed the rush across England to France, and I have no
  regrets, and if at any other time," he said, with mock earnestness, "you can
  find an excuse for sending me into the wilds of Switzerland or to the Black
  Forest or to Paris even, I shall be ever your most devoted and obliging
  servant."</p>

  <p>They chatted about the people of Bulboro' for some time.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you never see our friend, Jerry?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have seen her pretty frequently," he said, and was on the point of
  telling her about the telegram he had received when something stopped him. He
  could not even then account for his reticence in the matter, only he was
  satisfied that she would rather it remained a secret between themselves.</p>

  <p>There was a delicious little sense of intimacy in preserving that secret.
  He felt rather than knew that Jerry had sent it on an impulse of the moment;
  he had analysed her character so far as to know that such a course would be
  quite consistent with her erratic temperament.</p>

  <p>Curiously enough, it did not occur to him at that moment that the girl
  might have sent a telegram for no other reason than because he had played a
  very prominent part in the creation of the new Bulboro' women's hospital, and
  that, as chairwoman of the committee controlling its destinies, she would
  necessarily wish to keep in touch with the largest subscriber.</p>

  <p>It is something more than a coincidence that even Geraldine Brand had not
  thought of that explanation to be put upon her telegram.</p>

  <p>"They will have to be awfully careful with Jerry," said Lady Heron Wendall
  thoughtfully. She is wild, and she will take a great deal of training."</p>

  <p>"I suppose Sir John is sufficiently man of the world to be able to keep
  her in good shape?"</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I suspect these men of the world; their worldliness is purely selfish.
  They think only of themselves, and they very often find it impossible to
  imagine a crisis in some other person's affairs, particularly if that other
  person is a woman."</p>

  <p>"But I thought Sir John was a&mdash;" Anthony hesitated.</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"He is, indeed," she said dryly; "but that does not mean that he knows how
  women feel. Of course, Jerry is a very wise little bird, and is pretty sure
  to make a good match. The men adore her. Don't you find yourself in that
  category?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry if my reply disappoints you," he laughed; "but so far I have
  not reached farther along the road towards adoration than a wholesome respect
  for her powers of organization," and he told Lady Beatrice about the women's
  hospital, brushing over such part as he had played with a vague reference to
  the terms of his uncle's will.</p>

  <p>"It is curious that she never wrote to me about that, but possibly there
  are letters waiting at Nice for me&mdash;you see, I did not tell anybody I
  was coming to Paris."</p>

  <p>There was a little pause.</p>

  <p>"Who is the fortunate man?" asked Anthony after a while.</p>

  <p>"The fortunate man." She raised her eyebrows. "You are speaking of Jerry.
  There is no fortunate man, so far as I know. They all consider themselves
  fortunate to be admitted into the charmed circle of her favour."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, Bexley?"</p>

  <p>She knit her brows and pursed her lips.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think Bexley," she said after a while. "Bexley would bore
  Jerry to tears. I don't think there is anybody, doctor," she said gaily. "The
  field is open for you."</p>

  <p>"People are always suggesting impossible things to me," he laughed.
  "Ambrose Cohen wants me to stand for Parliament as a Unionist candidate."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Because Parliament would bore me as much as Bexley would bore Miss
  Brand," he said. "Parliament is a tremendous occupation for an idle
  man&mdash;but I am not an idle man."</p>

  <p>He made no further reference to Geraldine and her matrimonial prospects.
  He had a feeling that it was rather a delicate subject to pursue, though why
  he should think so he could not for the life of him understand. Also
  reference to Geraldine's multifarious lovers had unaccountably annoyed him.
  Later in the evening, when he was getting into his pyjamas in the narrow
  space which the <i>wagon-lit</i> apartment afforded him, he wondered why the
  question of Geraldine Brand and her lovers should allow of anything more than
  the faintest interest in so scientific minded a a person as himself.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is the narrowing influence of Bulboro'," he complained to
  himself as he sat on the edge of his bed and lit his final pipe. Bulboro' was
  making him domestic, was implanting in him all the characteristics of a
  confirmed gossip. He was getting provincial in this one sense. "Blow
  Bulboro'!" he said as he turned over on his pillow and went to sleep.</p>

  <p>He had expected to be absent for three days, for it had occurred to him
  from the urgent character of Lady Heron Wendall's wire that she would need
  his services for that time at least. But she had shown no disposition to
  detain him, and he had welcomed rather than otherwise the excuse for
  returning to London.</p>

  <p>London offered a thousand amusements and a thousand attractions, but he
  heeded neither. A more important inducement to him to tarry was the fact that
  he had given instructions for certain renovations and repairs to be made in
  his absence, repairs which would not be completed if he returned at once, and
  since the presence of workmen in the house would seriously interfere with his
  comfort, he decided to stay for a couple of days in London, and put in the
  time usefully at one of the laboratories of the Tropical School of
  Medicine.</p>

  <p>He notified Jocks as to his change of address and plans and gave himself
  over for two days to the pursuit of a small and virulent microbe who bore a
  name disproportionate to its size.</p>

  <p>He arrived back in Bulboro' in the afternoon of the fourth day and was
  welcomed correctly by Mr. Jocks.</p>

  <p>"Nothing has happened, sir," said Jocks. "All your instructions have been
  carried out. Mr. Gill was here for two days, but the third day he did not
  turn up, so I got another man to finish the work."</p>

  <p>"Didn't turn up," said Anthony in surprise. "Is he ill?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Jocks. "I have seen him in the town, and he has also
  addressed a meeting last night."</p>

  <p>"He came, then?" asked Anthony, as he busied himself with the accumulation
  of correspondence at the desk.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Jocks. "He came without any hesitation; I must confess
  that I did not expect he would, knowing his feelings about you, but he
  accepted the offer I made him, and has done a lot of work. He fixed this
  door"&mdash;he pointed to the door&mdash;"he has mended the old greenhouse,
  and has put a new step to the kitchen."</p>

  <p>"You need not bother to give me a detailed list," said Anthony, "as long
  as his work was satisfactory. Has he been paid?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, he never came to be paid."</p>

  <p>"Very good," said Anthony, and with a nod dismissed the butler. He was in
  the midst of his work when Lady Heron Wendall's commission occurred to him He
  took a bunch of keys from his pocket, and going to the safe at the side of
  the fire-place, unlocked the little door. The box was there, and he lifted it
  out.</p>

  <p>"This ought to be locked, too," he muttered, as he placed the receptacle
  upon the table.</p>

  <p>It was secured by a strap.</p>

  <p>Something about that strap arrested his attention; it was fastened very
  tightly and strapped down to the last possible hole.</p>

  <p>"That's very curious," said Anthony, and tried to release it. For some
  time it defied his efforts, but at last the strap gave and the steel tongue
  came out of the hole. "I wonder who fastened that?" asked Anthony in wonder.
  He remembered that Lady Heron Wendall had been to the cupboard, but she would
  not have fixed it so tightly.</p>

  <p>He threw the box open and uttered an exclamation.</p>

  <p>There should have been a big bundle of letters and two diaries fastened
  together with a rubber band; these and a few oddments comprised the contents
  of the box. But the letters and the diaries had gone.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16">XVI. &mdash; BROTHERS DISAGREE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Two days before the return of Anthony Manton to Bulboro',
  and on the second day of his engagement, Mr. Gill found himself alone in the
  cosy study of his enemy. It was a big room&mdash;a billiard-room without a
  table, as somebody had described it&mdash;yet for all its size it conveyed
  the impression of cosiness, with its engravings, its big chairs, and its
  old-fashioned open hearth. One wall was half hidden by bookshelves, the wall
  in which the fire-place was placed was so crowded with pictures and china
  that there was little of the wall itself to be seen.</p>

  <p>John Gill looked round with a look of grim satisfaction on his face. So
  this was Manton's study&mdash;he was here alone.</p>

  <p>It was in the hope that he might find himself so circumstanced that he had
  accepted the commission.</p>

  <p>This Anthony Manton, man of the world and accredited agent of the devil,
  was fair game for his cunning and his wisdom. Gill needed support for the
  case he was preparing against the doctor.</p>

  <p>Already he had accumulated, with a most earnest and diligent effort,
  evidence to Anthony's discredit. He had canvassed Bulboro' most thoroughly;
  he had interviewed parents of children who had died under treatment, he had
  procured sworn statements (or they amounted to sworn statements in his view)
  from dissatisfied patients of every kind, which he had planned should form in
  the aggregate the most damning indictment that had ever been arrayed against
  one man More than this, he had fostered most sedulously the discontent which
  undoubtedly existed amongst a certain class with Anthony Manton's line of
  treatment.</p>

  <p>The very poor and the very ignorant have certain conventions in their
  dealings with the medical profession, conventions which can only be outraged
  at some cost to the reputation of the person affected.</p>

  <p>For instance, a doctor must at all times express his opinion that the use
  of the knife is unnecessary, and that anything from appendicitis to toothache
  can be cured by the judicious administration of drugs. A surgeon who employs
  the knife too readily is self-confessed an ignorant person, who has not
  thoroughly acquired a knowledge of the healing art, and is covering his
  deficiencies by a drastic resort to surgery. There had grown, too, a
  persistent rumour that Anthony was a vivisectionist, and that the rambling
  dwelling he occupied was a veritable repository of horrors.</p>

  <p>It stood to reason, said the folk of poorer Bulboro', that a man who was,
  so to speak, a foreign doctor, and who had spent all his life amongst savages
  and cannibals, could not be possessed of those proper feelings which would
  enable him to appreciate the demands which the civilization of Bulboro' put
  upon him.</p>

  <p>There was the case of the dog whom Anthony had been seen leading into the
  house, and who, according to all reports, had never emerged again. The dog in
  question had a broken forefoot, and Anthony had taken the poor brute into his
  surgery and attempted to mend him up. When it was apparent that the wretched
  animal was too far gone to benefit by his skill, he had painlessly
  chloroformed him out of his misery.</p>

  <p>Rumour grows on nothing; it springs to life quicker than the mushroom,
  and, like the mushroom, grows best in dark and noisome places. Gill had no
  doubt in his own mind that rumour spoke the truth; indeed, he had accepted
  the nebulous stories of Anthony's evil practice readily, even eagerly.</p>

  <p>Now he hoped to discover in his search some evidence more damaging than
  that which he at present possessed.</p>

  <p>The drawers of Anthony Manton's desk had presented considerable
  difficulty, and after one or two vain and ineffectual attempts to open them
  the man had abandoned his quest, with the satisfying thought, however, that
  their contents could hardly assist him, since, if they referred at all to the
  outrageous practices, they would be couched in Latin, a language which Gill
  in common with many other people, imagined was the private and exclusive
  property of the medical profession, and chiefly employed to deceive the
  ignorant as to the constituents of the prescription. But the cupboard at the
  side of the fireplace had offered him greater opportunity with less labour.
  He had waited for a favourable moment until he knew that Mr. Jocks was in the
  town making his morning purchases, and then he had tried a variety of keys
  upon the little oaken safe.</p>

  <p>Here the way lay clear before him; he found the box strapped loosely
  round, and the warning label, "Not to be opened under any circumstances,
  except by its owner," was all the incentive he required.</p>

  <p>With trembling hands he carried the box to the desk, unfastened the strap,
  and threw the lid back. To his disappointment, there was no evidence here of
  vivisection, nothing more than a bundle of letters, a few scraps of African
  equipment, a revolver of foreign make, and a canvas cartridge-belt. He looked
  at the letters, extracted one, and read it.</p>

  <p>He had no scruples, because he was of that variety of human being which
  reserves its best and noblest emotions for direct transmission to its Maker
  and is unhampered by any feeling of necessity for offering its tribute
  through the indirect homage of charity.</p>

  <p>He read one letter, and two pink spots coloured his cheeks as he realized
  the importance of the find. The second letter was in French, and he put it
  aside. For an hour he read, until he saw from where he stood Mr. Jocks'
  sedate form marching up the drive to the servants' entrance. He hastily
  slipped the diary and letters into his pocket, re-strapped the box, using
  perhaps a little more force than he would have done had he been moved by less
  poignant emotions, replaced it in its cupboard and locked the door. He had
  finished his task; there was no further need to stay in the doctor's house.
  His course of action, his line of conduct, had been revealed to him in a
  flash.</p>

  <p>With all possible haste he made his way to the shop where Mr. Montague
  Silver was engaged at that moment in chiding two idle apprentices on their
  tardiness, which had resulted in the handbills for the Street League being
  undelivered on the previous night.</p>

  <p>"It is something sickening," said Silver, properly indignant. "I took more
  trouble with that handbill than ever I have taken with anything in my life,
  and here you go and botch it up. Can't you be trusted without me?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," confessed one of the apprentices disconcertingly. The frankness
  somewhat embarrassed Mr. Silver.</p>

  <p>"All the afternoon I stood making up that handbill," he said, "puttin'
  rules round it, and justifying* them four angels I got especially down from
  London, and now they won't take the delivery. It's enough to make a
  man&mdash;" Montague Silver checked the coarseness of his illustration at the
  sight of Gill.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Justifying is employed here as a printer's term.]</p>

  <p>"I want to see you at once," said Gill, and passed through the shop to the
  parlour behind, Silver following reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"I have got that letter of yours set up. I was going to send you a proof
  this afternoon.'</p>

  <p>"What is that?" asked the other. He had for the moment forgotten his
  previous commission.</p>

  <p>"The letter to the editor," explained Silver. "I had to do it when my
  apprentices were out; you see I couldn't let them know."</p>

  <p>"You needn't trouble about it now," said Gill.</p>

  <p>"Thank the Lord for that," said Mr. Silver with genuine relief. "I was
  afraid of it."</p>

  <p>"Look at this," interrupted Gill. He pulled out a bundle of papers and
  slammed them on the table. "Here is evidence, my brother, if evidence is
  needed, of this sinful woman's crime."</p>

  <p>Mr. Montague Silver lifted up the letters and examined them.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with those?" he asked blandly, well knowing the
  reply he would receive.</p>

  <p>"I am going to print them and distribute them, that all the world may know
  what this woman is."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed," said Mr. Silver politely. "And who is going to print
  'em?"</p>

  <p>"You are," said the other.</p>

  <p>Silver took up the letter which he had first examined, and adjusting his
  glasses on his nose, read it again. He read it through with an air of
  conscientious thoroughness from the very beginning to the very end.</p>

  <p>"You are not going to print a letter like this, brother?" he asked,
  looking over his spectacles, his mouth open, his scrappy eyebrows raised.</p>

  <p>"I am," said Gill firmly.</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Montague Silver.</p>

  <p>He took his glasses off, wiped them carefully, and put them into his
  waistcoat pocket.</p>

  <p>"You can print them if you like," he said, "but I won't."</p>

  <p>"You won't? Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because it's a rotten thing to do," said Mr. Silver. "And I ain't going
  to do any more rotten things."</p>

  <p>"You are going to print these," said Gill, white with passion. "I tell you
  I will have them printed if I have to ruin myself to do it."</p>

  <p>"You can ruin yourself as much as you like," said Mr. Silver, gazing at
  the ceiling with a blank and immovable gaze, "but you ain't going to ruin
  me."</p>

  <p>"Nobody would know," said Gill.</p>

  <p>"What about God?" said Mr. Silver, his eyes still fixed on the ceiling.
  "There ain't nothing in the world which God don't know&mdash;at least it's my
  idea of Scripture."</p>

  <p>"Such an act would be pleasing in the eyes of God," said the other
  harshly. "You are leading a woman from the paths of sin by way of tribulation
  to the mercy-seat."</p>

  <p>"I dare say," said Mr. Silver, unconvinced.</p>

  <p>"Do you refuse to do as I wish?" asked Gill.</p>

  <p>"That's so, you've hit it," said Silver, with marked patience. "Do you
  know where I can go?"</p>

  <p>"You can go to 'ell," said Mr. Silver, lapsing entirely and absolutely
  from grace.</p>

  <p>Gill stepped back as though he had been shot.</p>

  <p>"You!" he said in a shocked voice, "you, brother!"</p>

  <p>"Brother, be damned," said Mr. Silver, enjoying, as it seemed, his
  unaccustomed debauch. "Don't you come brothering me; I am sick of you, I am
  tired of the whole damn shoot of you; you can go along and split if you like.
  I'll do three months with pleasure; it will give me time to forget some of
  the muck I have been listening to for the last year or two. I am tired of
  you," he repeated loudly, "all of you&mdash;the brotherhood, the bloomin'
  league, and the bloomin' chapel, too. I am tired of being a Christian. I
  would sooner be a bookmaker Yes, I would," he went on sinfully and rapidly.
  "I would sooner stand up at point-to-point meetings, shout the odds an'
  chisel the rungs. I would sooner go welshing, I would sooner be a poacher, I
  would sooner pass counterfeit coin, I would sooner do anything in the world
  than put up with fellows like you. Why," he said, and pointed his accusing
  finger at the letter on the table, "there ain't a three-card man who would
  print a letter like that&mdash;from a poor woman who has done you no harm,
  an' if you can show me a printer who would, I would go after the
  &mdash;&mdash;" (here he employed a phrase which was beyond pardon, and
  certainly beyond recording) "an' I would wring his bloomin' neck, I would
  indeed."</p>

  <p>He went to a corner of his parlour and lifted down his jacket, put it on
  carefully, and took down his hat.</p>

  <p>"Go to the police," he said, "if you like, and tell them all you know
  about me. If you want me"&mdash;he stood dramatically at the door, a stout
  and unrepentant figure&mdash;"if you want me you will find me at the 'Blue
  Boar', on The Chad."</p>

  <p>He went out slamming the door behind him, and left Mr. Gill staring.</p>

  <p>The door opened again, and Montague Silver's head came peeping back. "And
  gettin' drunk," he added joyously.</p>

  <p>Gill did not go to the station-house, and there was very good reason why
  he should not.</p>

  <p>He had no very complete evidence to assist him in convincing the
  emissaries of the law that Silver was the malefactor which Gill knew him to
  be. Moreover, self-preservation played some part in his decision. Even in his
  fanaticism he saw that the magistrates would put a very unfavourable
  construction upon the demand which he had made of Silver. There must be
  another way of spreading the story of Beatrice Heron Wendall's infamy,
  something more subtle. In the end, after much cogitation, he found a
  typewriting office, and by carefully copying such of the letters as he wanted
  to use and eliminating the names, and, moreover, representing that the
  necessity for copying these letters was not totally unconnected with a law
  case in which he was concerned, he succeeded in having a hundred mimeograph
  copies made of four of the letters. He left the names blank, and spent two
  pleasant evenings filling those blanks in, in his own handwriting. It was a
  labour of love. Beatrice Heron Wendall had offended him deeply, wounding his
  self-pride in her refusal to agree to the mad scheme he had formulated. These
  institutions with which he was associated were the very life-blood of John
  Gill. He lived for them, particularly for the Brotherhood and the Street
  League. He may have harboured in his secret heart an ambition to create from
  the seed of the Brotherhood (at once an offshoot and a feeder to three sects)
  a separate and distinct Church with himself as its head.</p>

  <p>His greatest efforts were in the direction of securing recruits to these
  healthy branches of the Christian army, and the refusal of Beatrice had been
  a bitter blow. For there is no vanity so unreasoning as the vanity of that
  peculiar order of mind which is self-described as the "professing Christian
  ". It is a vanity which is elated less by the quality of salvation than the
  quantity of the saved, and is flung into the fits of gloom not so much by
  reason of the fact that the human heart is hard and difficult to move as by
  the reflection upon their own powers of persuasiveness which failure
  advertises to rival Christians. He had now another reason for his hatred.
  This woman had stolen his daughter from him. So he argued, wilfully blind to
  every circumstance. In his own way he had been fond of the child, he had not
  realized how fond until she was taken from him, as a result of his own
  wilfulness and malice.</p>

  <p>A labour of love! Say rather a labour of hate&mdash;the hate which
  righteous men have for the evil with which they credit their enemies.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17">XVII. &mdash; TWO SUMMONSES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Anthony lost no time in pursuing his inquiries. He more than
  suspected the thief, and a brief examination of the agitated Mr. Jocks
  confirmed his suspicions. The theft explained the hasty retirement of Mr.
  Gill from the scene of his labours. That evening Anthony handed over the
  duties of the dispensary to Dr. Painter and walked down to Gill's house.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Gill was a little flustered at seeing him, and a little fearful, too,
  so fearful that she had not the courage to invite him into her parlour, a
  remissness outrageous to her sense of hospitality. Her husband was out; he
  had been out all the afternoon. She hesitated when Anthony questioned her as
  to where the man was to be found.</p>

  <p>Poor soul, she needed news of her "daughter ", and was cheerful at the
  mention of her, but Anthony had no time for sentiment at the moment. He came
  back to the subject of the man he sought.</p>

  <p>He might be in one of three places. She compromised to that extent.
  Probably he would be at the little office of the Brotherhood in Market Street
  The Brotherhood shared with the Street League the rent of a small hall, and
  one corner of the bleak room had been partitioned off to make a bureau for
  the diligent secretary. It was here that Anthony found his man. A light
  shining through one of the windows betrayed his presence, but the door which
  Anthony tried was locked. He knocked, and Gill's voice demanded who was
  there.</p>

  <p>"It is I," said Anthony, "Dr. Manton."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence and a little thud. Anthony walked in as the door
  was unfastened, and looked quickly round the apartment.</p>

  <p>There was a small safe in which the books not only of the Brotherhood, but
  of several other organizations in which Gill was interested, were kept.</p>

  <p>That was a likely receptacle, and damning evidence of the use to which
  Gill intended putting his "find" was to be read in a sheet of mimeographed
  paper which had been rejected because of faint printing, and which now lay on
  the floor.</p>

  <p>A man of quick observation was Anthony Manton. He saw a pad on which one
  or two words had been blotted so incessantly as to create something of a
  pattern on the paper. His quick eyes read one inscription plainly. "Lady
  Heron Wendall," it said again and again. He could only guess the work on
  which the man had been engaged.</p>

  <p>The room was innocent of furniture save for a plain deal table and a
  chair, and the table by the side of which Gill was standing was empty.</p>

  <p>The light of a hanging oil lamp shone on his face, and his accusing and
  tragic eyes were turned upon Anthony.</p>

  <p>"What do you want, Dr. Anthony Manton?" he asked. He had a practice of
  calling people by their full names in such a manner as to suggest that the
  name in itself was a possession of unwholesome potency.</p>

  <p>"I want to see you," said Anthony, peeling his gloves slowly, and placing
  his hat without invitation upon the table.</p>

  <p>Gill shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why you should want to see me," he said insolently, "unless
  you have thought better of our conversation the other day."</p>

  <p>"That is not exactly the truth, is it?" asked Anthony. "I rather imagine
  you expected to see me, and expected me to come in a less reasonable frame of
  mind than I am in." The other was silent.</p>

  <p>"Because," the doctor went on with some emphasis, "when you commit a
  robbery in a house in which you are engaged out of pure kindliness, it is
  usual to expect the owner of that house, and, for the moment at any rate, of
  the stolen goods, to make an urgent call."</p>

  <p>"I have stolen nothing," said Gill doggedly.</p>

  <p>Anthony looked at him with a puzzled expression.</p>

  <p>"Curiously enough," he said, "I did not expect you to deny it."</p>

  <p>"I have stolen nothing," repeated Gill.</p>

  <p>"Have you taken anything from the cupboard by the fireplace in my
  room?"</p>

  <p>The man made no answer.</p>

  <p>"Yes or no?</p>

  <p>"I have done that which I have been directed to do," said Gill.</p>

  <p>Anthony was very patient. He knew that this was tantamount to a
  confession, and as near to an admission of guilt as he was likely to secure.
  He could never quite accustom himself to listen without resentment to
  Bulboro' and a certain section of Bulboro's people deputizing their
  Calvarys.</p>

  <p>"You will please hand me back the things you have taken, and there the
  matter will end," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>Gill made no response to the request. There was a stubborn set to his jaw,
  and no indication of compromise or penitence in his lean face.</p>

  <p>"You have heard what I said," repeated Anthony. "I want the papers you
  took from that cupboard in my study."</p>

  <p>"I heard what you said," replied the other.</p>

  <p>After a moment's hesitation he went to the 'safe and unlocked it. Anthony
  saw the familiar bundle which he knew so well.</p>

  <p>"Everything is there," said the man.</p>

  <p>"What are those papers at the bottom of the safe?" asked Anthony with
  pardonable curiosity.</p>

  <p>"That is nothing to do with you."</p>

  <p>"May I see one?"</p>

  <p>"You can see nothing," said Gill, and made as if to shut the safe, but
  Anthony caught the door and swung it back. He grasped a handful of the sheets
  and pulled them out. A moment's glance was sufficient to show him the purport
  of the copies.</p>

  <p>"So that is the idea, is it?" His voice was sharp and angry, and a dull
  red crept up into his cheeks.</p>

  <p>"You insufferable blackguard!" he cried. "What object do you expect to
  serve in betraying a woman's precious secrets?</p>

  <p>"I can lead her to Christ," said the man quietly.</p>

  <p>"You are hopeless," said Anthony, controlling his rising indignation.</p>

  <p>"I can lead her to the fountain of blood which cleanses us from all sins,"
  the man went on, his voice rising. "I can break her hard heart, and bring her
  in humbleness to the feet of God."</p>

  <p>"Why she?" asked Anthony, humouring the man. "Why not I? I am a much more
  hardened sinner. Why attack the weak and the helpless? Is it because they
  cannot strike back at you, Gill? Is the drastic method of creating converts
  to be restricted only to the boys you can thrash and the women whom you can
  shame? Concentrate your attention on men&mdash;it will be fairer."</p>

  <p>"In God's good time you will all find grace," said the man; "you who have
  persecuted me, the other man who shamefully drove me from my employment
  because of my convictions, and the harlot who taught my daughter to deceive
  me."</p>

  <p>"Which particular harlot are you referring to?" asked the weary Anthony.
  "I cannot keep track of them."</p>

  <p>The man glowered at him</p>

  <p>"The harlot," he almost hissed, "Geraldine Brand&mdash;who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The words were hardly out of his mouth when Anthony struck him, and he
  fell back with a crash into a corner of the room. He picked himself up slowly
  and put his hand to his bruised cheek.</p>

  <p>"You will be sorry for that, Dr. Manton," he said.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for it now," said Anthony, white as death. "I am sorry that I
  allowed my temper to get the better of me." He pulled open the door of the
  safe, Gill making no attempt to prevent him, and carefully cleared out the
  whole of the mimeographed copies of the stolen letters, tied them into a
  rough bundle, and thrust them into his overcoat pocket.</p>

  <p>It had not been a wholly profitable evening, he thought, as he made his
  way up to Pilgrim's Rest. He was very angry with himself&mdash;it seemed to
  have become a normal state of mind with him. And yet, he thought, he had been
  known for his remarkable equanimity in the days when neither hot nor
  breathless nights nor intermittent sickness ruffled his serenity.</p>

  <p>He reached the house without having arrived at an excuse for his
  remarkable departure from placidity, and found a message awaiting him from
  High Mount. It was in Sir John's handwriting, and was brief.</p>

  <p>"Come up at once," it ran, "Geraldine has had a fresh attack. Grimthorpe
  has diagnosed the trouble as appendicitis, and says an immediate operation is
  necessary. Geraldine insists upon your performing the operation."</p>

  <p>For a moment the words swam in front of Anthony's eyes, and his hands
  shook. Never in his life had such a communication produced that effect upon
  him He walked up and down the study striving to collect his whirling
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>For the moment he experienced a physical nausea&mdash;a horrible sinking
  sensation that left his heart beating uncomfortably. Then a fear gripped him,
  and perspiration stood upon his forehead and his very knees trembled.</p>

  <p>"Malaria," he said, but knew that he was wilfully misinterpreting the
  symptoms.</p>

  <p>He turned to the chauffeur who had brought the summons. "Tell Sir John I
  shall be up immediately. Did you bring the car with you? I thought I saw one
  outside the gate."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the man.</p>

  <p>"I will not be long. Just wait outside for me, will you?"</p>

  <p>He braced himself to his task, and, opening his surgical case, carefully
  selected the instruments he would require. He got on the telephone to
  Westlake, a young doctor of the East side, a man who was an excellent
  anaesthetist. Ten minutes later he was with Sir John Brand in the library of
  High Mount. The face of the baronet was grey and drawn with anxiety.</p>

  <p>"By Jove! I'm glad you've come," he said thankfully. "I am afraid there is
  no doubt about it being appendicitis. Grimthorpe is here, and he is quite
  willing that you should perform the operation. It is a terrible business,
  Manton."</p>

  <p>He had lost all the buoyant gaiety of manner which was peculiarly his.</p>

  <p>"Not so very terrible," said Anthony cheerfully&mdash;it was curious how
  quickly he had recovered his hold over himself, but the sight of the other's
  distress nerved and strengthened him.</p>

  <p>"Geraldine told me to bring you up the minute you came," Sir John said,
  and led the way up the broad stairway to the floor above. "You really don't
  think that there is any&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Danger&mdash;bless my soul, no!" replied Anthony.</p>

  <p>Sir John heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Thank God!" he said.</p>

  <p>He could not see inside Anthony's mind or gather from his unmoved face the
  panic that came and went gustily in the doctor's breast.</p>

  <p>Geraldine's room was in the right wing of High Mount, and was in every way
  the best suite of apartments the old house afforded. Her father had spared
  nothing in the way of expense to make her life as happy and as pleasing as
  possible. The room itself was big and well lighted; it was more like the
  bower of an Eastern princess, thought Anthony, as he entered the room, for a
  big carpet specially woven to Sir John's order covered the whole of the
  floor, and two great hanging lamps of silver and tortoiseshell afforded light
  and added something to the Eastern character of the room. In the midst of
  this great room the tiny rosewood bedstead was pitiably small and the figure
  that smiled a welcome to Anthony seemed swallowed up and lost in an immensity
  of space.</p>

  <p>She flushed pink and offered him her hand.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it dreadful, doctor?" she complained with a pathetic little smile,
  "and yet I have suspected it for weeks&mdash;that is why I wired you in
  Paris."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" he said blankly.</p>

  <p>He did not know exactly what else to say. He was divided between his
  professional instinct to get at the trouble, and the working of a new desire
  for the inception of which Bulboro' and its life was mainly
  responsible&mdash;the desire to be conventionally pleasant.</p>

  <p>He pulled up a chair to the side of the bed and seated himself. "You know
  I haven't a very good bedside manner," he said, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Nor I either," she responded, with brave gaiety. "But my side of the bed
  is perhaps more trying than yours. It is so awfully unromantic, isn't it? I'm
  sure heroines in stories never have appendicitis&mdash;I don't know exactly,
  though, why I am weaving myself out a story and discovering heroic qualities
  in myself."</p>

  <p>"Yes, all the best heroines nowadays have appendicitis," said Anthony
  untruthfully, "and heroines out of books, too."</p>

  <p>"Do you read novels?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I must admit that I don't," he confessed. "Life in Bulboro' is
  too serious a thing to encourage that kind of frivolity."</p>

  <p>He was feeling her pulse; there was no doubt whatever about it as far as
  the pulse showed. That rapid, irregular beat was one of the most significant
  symptoms of the disease.</p>

  <p>"I wanted you to operate." She lowered her voice as she spoke and looked
  across with a tender glance to where her father stood. He had walked to the
  window and was staring out into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Somehow I trust you," she went on, and caught his hand as she turned her
  face to him. "I like to feel when I go down to the edge of life, that there
  is some one near me who is young and buoyant, and who knows just how
  wistfully I am looking at the world I leave, and perhaps one who"&mdash;she
  hesitated&mdash;"who likes me, though I am a most capricious girl with little
  or no manners," she smiled.</p>

  <p>He did not speak. She was making things very hard for him if she did but
  know. It was heart-breaking to look down into the clear depths of her grey
  eyes and to see the soul of the woman shining through. To read in that
  intense and trusting scrutiny of hers all that her heart spoke. He clenched
  his teeth at the thought of what an hour might bring forth. Suppose they had
  left the operation until too late&mdash;suppose there were any of the
  complications which came from a tardiness of treatment, suppose He shut his
  eyes to blot out the vision which his fear had conjured.</p>

  <p>"If I look over the edge," she was saying, "I shall know, though I am
  unconscious, though my soul and my mind are far away from here, that your
  strong arm and your strong hand can pull me back again. That is a selfish
  thought, but I wanted you because"&mdash;her voice was little above a
  whisper&mdash;"because if death should come to me I know you would help me
  along the rougher part of the road."</p>

  <p>He looked down at her, a new tenderness in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"My child," he said softly, and took her hand in a reassuring grasp,
  "there must be no talk of dying, because you aren't to die&mdash;because
  there is no danger of your dying"&mdash;he spoke slowly and
  deliberately&mdash;"and because this operation is hardly worth being called
  an operation. It is infinitely less dangerous than having your tonsils cut,
  and much less painful than having a tooth out. I am going to ask one of the
  other doctors to send your father away."</p>

  <p>The men he had summoned had arrived a little later. They made their brief
  examination of the girl, and all the time her eyes were fixed on Anthony
  Manton's face.</p>

  <p>At last there was a short consultation; a table was requisitioned and
  wheeled into the room, a screen placed where she might not see the gruesome
  preparations which were being made, and then Anthony and the anesthetist
  approached her.</p>

  <p>"First of all we shall try an experiment which will not be at all
  painful," said Anthony, with a smile, "but in case it is I am going to see
  that you go right off to the land of never-never."</p>

  <p>He took the cone from Westlake's hand, for he felt instinctively that she
  would rather he did all that was visible to her and all of which she was
  conscious. He sprinkled a few drops from his crystal bottle on to the
  lint-covered cone.</p>

  <p>"It isn't very bad, is it?" he smiled. He sat on the edge of the bed. She
  could see his face over the sides of the cone, and the smile reassured
  her.</p>

  <p>"Not so very," she answered. "Should I not be on a table or
  something?"</p>

  <p>"Not on your life," said Anthony cheerfully. "I should never think of
  putting you on so hard a thing as a table. This is just going to be a little
  mild experiment."</p>

  <p>He dropped some more on to the cone and held it over her mouth.</p>

  <p>"It is very sickly stuff, isn't it?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly horrible," he admitted; "but I have become so used to it that I
  prefer it to eau-de-Cologne."</p>

  <p>Her eyes met his; he was still smiling, and her lips moved in
  response.</p>

  <p>"Does anything happen?" she asked through the cone.</p>

  <p>"In good time," said Anthony, "especially if you take nice deep
  breaths&mdash;imagine that you're taking a holiday at some place and filling
  your lungs full of inexpensive ozone. You see," he reproved her, "you are
  such an impatient young party, we shall have to discover one of those famous
  drugs one reads about in novels&mdash;the drug which is chucked in the face
  of the hero, rendering him immediately unconscious." By the time he had
  finished his speech the little drops were falling like rain.</p>

  <p>"It does seem a long, long time," she said fretfully.</p>

  <p>"I rather think you are very strong," said Anthony; "at least, I like to
  tell you so, because it cheers a patient to think that she is stronger than
  her unfortunate fellows. Don't you smell something like roses?"</p>

  <p>She made a little face.</p>

  <p>"Close your eyes and smell," he said.</p>

  <p>She closed her eyes obediently. She felt the cold draught of air as it
  rushed into her lungs with a curious roaring. She had never so completely
  realized how much work the lungs were called upon to perform as she did at
  that moment.</p>

  <p>She felt, it seemed, every atom of air, if air be in atoms, rushing busily
  through the passages of respiration and as busily rushing out again, its
  beneficent work accomplished. Now the roaring noise was in her ears and her
  heart began to flutter uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I like this very much," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose you do," said Anthony, "but you are doing famously."</p>

  <p>"I really don't think I like it," she said again; then she ceased to take
  very much interest in Anthony, for she was absorbed in gazing down a long,
  black tunnel at the end of which was one white, steady light.</p>

  <p>What was it? She realized after some thought that she was really looking
  up at the chloroform cone. But that was impossible because it really did not
  touch her eyes; perhaps they had left the blinds up and the light was shining
  through the window? That could not be, said her reason, because it was night.
  Then she saw as the light grew brighter the figure of a woman who carried a
  child in her arms and that woman was Beatrice Heron Wendall. She laughed a
  little.</p>

  <p>"I am having such a weird dream," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"A weird dream, have you?" said Anthony's voice.</p>

  <p>"Please stop the chloroforming for a little while; I want to tell you
  about it," she said.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," agreed the accommodating Anthony. "Try to get all that
  noxious vapour out of your lungs and tell me."</p>

  <p>She was breathing now with difficulty. The pain which had tortured her for
  days had gone, and in its place was a certain numbness which was less of a
  pain than a discomfort.</p>

  <p>"I thought I saw Beatrice Heron Wendall," she explained drowsily.</p>

  <p>"Open your eyes and tell us all about it," commanded Anthony. "You spoil
  the story by keeping your eyes shut."</p>

  <p>"I am too tired to open my eyes," she said, and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, but you must open your eyes," said Anthony in a tone of authority.
  "Good heavens! half the art of story-telling is to speak with your eyes, you
  know."</p>

  <p>He said this very, very deliberately, it seemed to the girl, and she
  opened her eyes and looked up. He had changed. That was the first thought
  which occurred to her. There were dark shadows under his eyes and a hard
  little line to his mouth. He was pale with a sort of greyness which she had
  never seen. It was as though the pallor was fighting to show itself through
  the tan of his face.</p>

  <p>"You look so funny, Anthony," she said. "Have you made your experiment?"
  It seemed quite natural for her to say Anthony, and his face betrayed no
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Don't move," he said gently. "Do you feel comfortable?"</p>

  <p>"When are you going to operate?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"The operation was over some ten minutes ago," he said, "and you are on
  the high-road to recovery. If you will be a good patient, and obedient girl,
  you will be up and about in a fortnight."</p>

  <p>"All over?" she said. "How perfectly ripping."</p>

  <p>She closed her eyes and fell into a dreamless slumber.</p>

  <p>Anthony went back to the disordered table, dried his instruments with care
  and replaced them in the case. He gave a few words of instruction to the two
  nurses, hastily summoned from the cottage hospital, and went down to Sir
  John.</p>

  <p>"How is she?" asked the baronet. He was tense and old with the anxiety of
  his long wait.</p>

  <p>"She is doing well," said Anthony, and his voice was sharp and shrill. Sir
  John forgot his own anxiety in the sight of the young man's face.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with you, Manton?&mdash;you look perfectly
  ghastly"</p>

  <p>"Do I?" said Anthony. "Well, you see I have had a pretty ghastly time.
  Doctors are not unlike other human beings, you know, Sir John," he said.</p>

  <p>Sir John Brand's eyes searched his face. "Do you know," he said slowly,
  "that never occurred to me."</p>

  <p>He said this very quietly, and the grave eyes that surveyed Anthony Manton
  had all the tender sympathy of a woman.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">On the second day following the operation Anthony came back
  from High Mount perfectly satisfied with the progress the girl was making.
  She would be perfectly well in a fortnight, and there was cause for
  unspeakable relief in that.</p>

  <p>He found an unexpected visitor in the person of a police inspector on his
  arrival at the house. Mr. Jocks had dreadful news to impart.</p>

  <p>"I thought it was an inquest, sir," he said confidentially, "but
  apparently it is something much more serious."</p>

  <p>"Much more serious?" asked Anthony, with a smile. "Exactly what do you
  call serious, Jocks?"</p>

  <p>"I understand, sir," said Mr. Jocks in a hushed voice, "that it is a
  summons for assault."</p>

  <p>Anthony looked his astonishment.</p>

  <p>"That is indeed very serious," he agreed, and went to unravel the
  mystery.</p>

  <p>He found the genial inspector very apologetic.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry to bother you, doctor," he said, "but the magistrates
  have granted a summons against you for assaulting John Gill on the evening of
  the twenty-eighth of March."</p>

  <p>So that was it. For two days Anthony had been oblivious of the existence
  of John Gill and he came back to the world of realities with a jar.</p>

  <p>"I remember the circumstances, and I am afraid I was in fault. I
  particularly do not wish this case to go into court for reasons which would
  be apparent to you 'if you knew the details. Is there any chance of offering
  this man some sort of compensation which he would accept?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not, sir," said the inspector regretfully. "By the way he went
  on before their worships, I should say he wouldn't be satisfied with anything
  less than his pound of flesh."</p>

  <p>Anthony nodded. "Very good, then, we shall have to be summoned," he said,
  with a wry face.</p>

  <p>The summons was annoying for many reasons. It might necessitate the
  introduction of Geraldine's name. He did not doubt that the charge which the
  man had formulated would be dismissed if the case came to a hearing, but he
  had no particular wish to go into a witness-box and confess that he had lost
  his temper, nor yet the cause of his lapse. There was neither honour nor
  glory nor satisfaction of any kind to be gained. The only thing to do was to
  see the obliging editor of the <i>Herald</i> and put the circumstances before
  him Mr. Western was the recipient of most of Bulboro's public troubles, and
  not a few of those which were strictly private.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he said when Anthony had told him the story, "the man is a
  blackguard, and there is no excuse for him, and so far as our paper is
  concerned, and the other journal, too, for the matter of that, there will be
  no publication; but you cannot stop these devils talking." He was referring
  to the folk of Bulboro' in these uncomplimentary terms.</p>

  <p>"When is the case coming on?"</p>

  <p>"In a week."</p>

  <p>"I will see what I can do; personally, I don't think I have much influence
  with Mr. Gill; he is rather sore with me, and he bombards me daily with most
  unpleasant predictions as to my future state. We had better try Stope."</p>

  <p>He went to the telephone and called a number.</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Stope in?" he asked. "Yes, it's Western speaking. I want to see
  you about something which is rather important to Dr. Manton. Can we come
  round? Thank you."</p>

  <p>He hung the receiver up.</p>

  <p>"He will see us now," he said.</p>

  <p>Anthony's car was at the door, and they drove to the beautiful little
  house which the Congregationalists had built for their pastor.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stope was a man of cultivated tastes, and his house, though small, was
  one of the most attractive that Anthony had entered since he had come to
  Bulboro'.</p>

  <p>More than this, Mr. Stope was the most kindly of hosts. In no
  circumstances did he show to greater advantage than in his intercourse with
  men and women of his own class. "Come to the dining-room," he said. "Have you
  had any lunch?" he asked, as he showed the two men in.</p>

  <p>"I have not thought of that," said Anthony, "but don't let us bother
  you."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said Mr. Stope. "One has to feed, and I am quite alone."</p>

  <p>Over the meal Anthony put the circumstances very clearly to the
  pastor.</p>

  <p>"Unpardonable," was Stope's comment, and he was genuinely annoyed with his
  faithful follower.</p>

  <p>"You cannot stop these people from applying Biblical epithets," he smiled,
  "and, of course "&mdash;he shook his head reproachfully at Anthony&mdash;"
  you were rather to blame."</p>

  <p>"I was an ass, but under the circumstances I felt justified."</p>

  <p>"You know best," said the pastor quietly, "whether any gentleman is
  justified in losing his temper. My point is that he is not, but that is
  beside the question. I understand that Miss Brand is very ill just now."</p>

  <p>"She is recovering from an operation," said Anthony.</p>

  <p>"That is bad luck&mdash;I mean the operation," said Stope, "but in a way
  it is providental. She won't hear anything about the case until it is ancient
  history."</p>

  <p>"Can you think of no way of stopping it, then?" asked the editor.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stope shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You know my friend Gill almost as well as I. A very worthy
  man&mdash;don't be carried away by prejudice into imagining that he is
  anything else. He is very hot for salvation, only unfortunately his way is
  not an inoffensive way, nor is it a way which commends itself to people who,
  like myself, think it is quite possible to be fervent without being
  extravagant&mdash;I'll do whatever is possible," he went on in the dubious
  tone of one who did not anticipate a successful issue to his endeavours; "but
  I warn you that my influence over Mr. Gill is of a somewhat uncertain
  character."</p>

  <p>It was a perfectly ridiculous position to be in&mdash;Anthony saw that,
  and found himself during the next few days explaining his conduct to the many
  people whom he desired should not hear of his mistaken prowess from other
  sources.</p>

  <p>"I don't see what else you could have done," said the baronet, who
  naturally was one of those most nearly affected; "I should probably have done
  the same, my boy. After all, it doesn't matter very much what the rascal
  says. Jerry needn't know of it&mdash;poor little girl! What made you so very
  angry?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm blest if I know," said the rueful Anthony. "I just flamed up and hit
  him. It was a stupid thing to do. The knowledge of my stupidity annoys me
  more than anything."</p>

  <p>Anthony had some thought of approaching Gill himself, but dismissed the
  idea as an unprofitable one. He saw the man twice in the course of the next
  few days. On the first occasion he was addressing a fairly large meeting at
  the corner of The Chad. The open-air meetings of the Street League were
  invariably well attended if the weather was propitious. Only by a stretch of
  imagination might be so described the evening Gill had his <i>bête noire</i>
  amongst his audience. The evening was cold and a fine rain was falling. There
  must be something unusual in a man's discourse to keep a crowd together under
  these conditions, and Anthony made his way to the outskirts of the throng,
  actuated to some extent by curiosity as tom the man's powers of oratory, to
  which Bulboro' readily bore testimony, and partly, too, in the expectation
  that the man would make some reference to himself. It was dark, and there was
  no fear that he would be recognized. Mr. Gill spoke from a shaky little
  extemporized platform, flanked by two great oil lamps, which advertised the
  meeting as being under the auspices of the Street League, and his theme was
  one of corruption in high places, of the persecution of the holy by the
  modern representatives of Dives, of the rottenness of the age and the need
  for a Knox.</p>

  <p>His high, strident voice carried across The Chad, his impassioned accents
  impressed even Anthony with the genuine nature of his faith. However mistaken
  this man might be, he believed in his mistakes more earnestly than most
  people believed in the things of which they had every reason to be sure.</p>

  <p>"Oh, for a John Knox!" cried the voice which, powerful and piercing as it
  was, seemed to Anthony to be a long way off. Yet every word, every syllable,
  the very burr in the man's speech, carried across to where he stood.</p>

  <p>"Oh, for some God-sent reformer to cleanse the defiled temple of God, to
  flog the money-changers of the temple, to abase the hypocrites and the
  mercenaries of God. I have been persecuted, my friends, for my convictions. I
  can praise God that He allows me to stand here to-night on this platform, in
  the face of the world and of this congregation, determined to speak the Word
  of the Lord before mankind. I praise God," he went on, his voice rising
  higher, "that I have been ill-treated for my Lord's sake, that I have been
  smitten, and cast into prison even as He was cast into prison by Pontius
  Pilate, and that I can still stand before you to-day as testifying to the
  power of my God."</p>

  <p>He wore no overcoat, though the rain had now increased to almost a
  downpour. His low collar was open, exposing his throat to the bitter winds.
  His threadbare jacket was saturated and his face shone with moisture.</p>

  <p>"Is there any one of those standing around me to-night," he asked, "who
  can justify all that has passed, all the persecution which I have suffered at
  the hands of the unrighteous?"</p>

  <p>He paused a moment. He had the true oratoric instinct for dramatic effect.
  It was not customary that these pauses should be filled by any member of the
  audience, certainly not of such an audience as this, but somebody broke
  through convention.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is," said a voice, "and a jolly good reason, too&mdash;you
  'umbugging blighter!"</p>

  <p>There was an instant stirring of the crowd, and every man craned his head
  to see the interrupter.</p>

  <p>"Have you given your reason, my brother?" asked Gill, leaning forward over
  the rostrum, both hands outspread, along the narrow rails. "Can you give me a
  reason for my persecution other than my love for the Lord?"</p>

  <p>"I can," said the voice. "I can, old friend, and don't you call me 'my
  brother', or I'll come up after you."</p>

  <p>It was Montague Silver, in a condition of advanced inebriety.</p>

  <p>"You ain't persecuted, but you ought to be prosecuted," said the voice,
  "you and all your long-faced pals of the Brotherhood." He was addressing a
  little meeting of his own now. "I've got the little shop down in Market
  Street," said Montague, remembering that on such public occasions as these no
  great harm was done by calling attention to his profession; "and if any of
  you gentlemen want cards printed, or handbills printed, or lists of runners
  and jockeys printed&mdash;anything bar tracts&mdash;I'm about from nine to
  six."</p>

  <p>He shook his head resolutely.</p>

  <p>"I bar tracts," he said with violence, "and anybody who wants cherub
  'cads, weeping gents over gravestones, or ole gents bein' fed by kind young
  ladies, can call me up and he shall have the pick of 'em at a knock-out
  price. Montague Silver," he repeated noisily. "Don't forget the old firm"</p>

  <p>They heard his voice rumbling into the distance as he made his way back to
  the Blue Boar, from whence the lure of John Gill and the voice of conscience
  had aroused him.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; FORGIVENESS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Anthony went on without waiting to hear Gill's rejoinder. He
  had no wish to be seen by any member of the fast-dwindling congregation. He
  was to see Gill again two days afterwards, when he was visiting a poor
  patient at the eastern end of the town. As he knocked at the door Gill came
  out. He scowled for a moment and then brushed past him.</p>

  <p>Then it was that Anthony learned for the first time of the strenuous
  attempt the man was making to secure evidence of his misdoings. Apparently
  Gill had very carefully canvassed all the dispensary patients who had been
  under Anthony's care to this end. Anthony was first annoyed, then amused. It
  explained in part the reluctance which his patients had shown in certain
  circumstances. It convinced him, too, that Gill was a formidable enemy and
  one who had to be seriously considered.</p>

  <p>Anthony, however, was saved the supreme annoyance of appearing at court,
  for on the night before the case was due to be heard, Gill was stricken down
  with bronchitis, a result of his open-air oratory under unfavourable climatic
  conditions. Without being exactly pleased by the man's misfortune, Anthony
  was considerably relieved when, in the absence of the prosecutor, the summons
  was allowed to lapse.</p>

  <p>"It's a jolly good thing for you," said Ambrose Cohen over the telephone,
  "that you didn't adopt my suggestion and stand for Parliament. You would have
  had a very poor chance in face of your having assaulted one of the dominant
  party."</p>

  <p>"Who is standing in the Conservative interest?" asked Anthony, who of late
  had found himself readily interested in Bulboro' doings.</p>

  <p>A little laugh came from the end of the wire. "I am," said Ambrose.
  "Funny, isn't it? The county hardly knows how to take it, but there seems to
  be no likelihood of finding a better candidate, so the local people have
  asked me to stand."</p>

  <p>"What is your chance?"</p>

  <p>"A fairly good one," replied the other dubiously, so dubiously that
  Anthony smiled.</p>

  <p>"I wish you good luck. You were the first friend I made in Bulboro', and
  I'll be the first man to vote for you."</p>

  <p>"Keep that fact to yourself, then," warned Ambrose. "You are not supposed
  to have any political opinions."</p>

  <p>The election promised to be short and sharp. It came upon Bulboro' with a
  rush in spite of the fact that both sides had made very elaborate
  preparations for months previous.</p>

  <p>But in a night and a day the whole of the hoardings of Bulboro' were
  covered with exhortations addressed to the independent elector. Exhortations
  which warned him alike as to the size of his loaf in the event of one party
  being returned to power, and promising him the wherewithal to provide himself
  with any size of loaf which his caprice might favour if the other were
  dominant. The Bulboro' hoardings became a riot of vivid colour and
  unveracious typography. Bulboro' was warned that the eyes of England were
  upon it.</p>

  <p>Whatever Bulboro' did would be right and equally wrong from one point of
  view or the other. Ordinarily sober individuals, who never under any
  circumstances displayed the slightest evidence of emotion, became hilarious
  and pugnacious; intelligent and conservative beings who would have shrunk
  from the barbarity of a pink tie, went about unashamed with huge rosettes of
  orange and of blue in the lapels of their respectable coats, and gaudy
  streamers of red and white floating from their whips.</p>

  <p>The electors of Bulboro' bore a strong family likeness to the electors of
  most other constituencies, in that they were traditionally Conservative or
  traditionally Liberal, and all the bill-posting and all the arguments which
  experienced and plausible speakers, especially imported from Westminster,
  employed, were so much effort wasted upon ninety-eight out of every hundred
  of the population.</p>

  <p>There were, indeed, two or three in every hundred, perhaps, who had no
  settled convictions one way or the other, and these possibly regretted
  bitterly the passing of that gorgeous and glorious period in electoral
  history when a man's vote was worth at least the price of a drink. There were
  people who said that Bulboro' was corrupt; that it was one of the few "rotten
  boroughs" remaining, and it is certain that formerly there was seldom an
  election that was not followed by a petition.</p>

  <p>The spectacle of a Jew standing in the Unionist cause and a parson
  contesting the borough in the Radical colours was excuse and reason enough
  for recriminations and personalities, but beyond a few sly references which
  Mr. Stope had made to the Mosaic law, there was little said on either side
  likely to create rancour in the most sensitive bosom. It was a beautiful and
  touching sight to see Pastor Childe, ordinarily something of a rival to Mr
  Stope in popular affection, conducting a vigorous campaign as Stope's first
  lieutenant.</p>

  <p>Pastor Childe had benefited considerably from his acquaintance with the
  party machinery of Bulboro', and it was on the cards that at the next General
  Election he himself would be invited to contest a seat in the North of
  England. He threw himself heart and soul into the work of supporting Mr.
  Stope's candidature, and his numerous followers followed his lead as ardently
  and as energetically as though they were working for their own beloved
  leader.</p>

  <p>The political sermon was now preached openly. Political pastors, one of
  whom already had the magical letters "M.P." after his name, came down from
  London to take the services, and the Pleasant Sunday Afternoons carried the
  good work of propaganda over the week-end. Every schoolroom, every branch and
  institution of church work which had association with the two chapels, worked
  diligently to secure the return of their man. Mr. Stope preached a sermon
  which was to excite more enthusiasm amongst his friends than any which had
  ever been heard in Bulboro'. The trend of that address was that if Christ had
  lived in the present age He would have been unpopular with the House of
  Lords, those hereditary enemies of progress. "We want light!" said Stope, and
  there was a chorus of "Amens" in the packed hall. It was light that the
  people were crying for; the cry was. "More bread, cheaper food, better
  dwelling-places, greater opportunities!" They were crying, in fact, for most
  of the things which the Liberal candidate at that moment had promised, in his
  electoral address, to secure for his constituency.</p>

  <p>One of the great London editors, a man who controlled the destinies of a
  Liberal group of journals, came down to Bulboro', and at Anthony's invitation
  stayed at Pilgrim's Rest&mdash;they had met before, were, in fact, old school
  friends, and Anthony welcomed the opportunity of offering his
  hospitality.</p>

  <p>After dinner, one night, the question of the religious candidate came up
  for discussion.</p>

  <p>"It's pretty beastly, isn't it," said the journalist with a smile. "But
  what are we to do? We can't turn down these fellows and say, because they are
  earnest Christians, that they can't be good Liberals. You've the same
  embarrassment on your side&mdash;I take it for granted that you are now a
  hardened Tory. Think of the parson jackass who introduces his political ideas
  and his puerile points of view into his sermons and his parish magazines.
  Fortunately the discipline in the Church of England is more strict, and there
  is always a bishop to sit on a budding Wolsey's head. But your bishops are
  politicians, anyway&mdash;and Tory almost to a man. The political
  Nonconformist parson represents the reaction against the bishop legislator.
  Everybody agrees that a political parson is a nuisance and something of an
  embarrassment, too&mdash;you see, we've got to support and to find fuel for
  him. In politics all things are fair, but I often think that the political
  parson is the unfairest aspect of the game. He has all the advantages, too,
  he has his audiences ready-made. The unassailable sanctity of his profession,
  his freedom from heckling, and in addition, and this is rather important, the
  fact that nine out of ten of his people say, 'Whatever this man is, he must
  be sincere because of his profession.'"</p>

  <p>"Suppose Stope is returned&mdash;what will happen? Is he the kind of man
  to make a stir in Parliament?"</p>

  <p>The journalist smiled sardonically. "He will go to Westminster with a half
  a dozen speeches ready for delivery, speeches which will establish him as
  firmly in Parliament as he is established in Bulboro'. The whip will give him
  one opportunity, and one only. He may probably make two speeches throughout
  the session, and only the first will be listened to. It's a rum game,
  politics."</p>

  <p>"Very," said Anthony. He had followed Cohen's advice and made no open
  demonstration of partisanship on the question of the hour.</p>

  <p>Pastor Childe, with rare courage, had come, in the best of good humour and
  kindest of moods, to persuade him to vote Liberal.</p>

  <p>"I don't think it matters very much which way I vote," said Anthony, with
  a smile. "If one has no very strong convictions and one must vote, why there
  is little to do but allow friendship to influence one."</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Cohen is your friend, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stope is also my friend," parried Anthony.</p>

  <p>"Which is the particular friend you are voting for this time?"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Anthony mysteriously.</p>

  <p>Childe was going away and had reached the door.</p>

  <p>"Have you heard anything about that unfortunate man, Gill?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, what is the matter with him?" asked Anthony.</p>

  <p>"He is in a terrible way, apparently. I have just seen my doctor, and he
  has asked&mdash;" He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Suggested I should be called in?" smiled Anthony.</p>

  <p>"He did, as a matter of fact," said the other frankly, "but I thought it
  might upset Gill."</p>

  <p>Anthony nodded. "I think you are right. What is the
  trouble&mdash;bronchitis?"</p>

  <p>"There is another complication which I fear is rather serious."</p>

  <p>"I shall be most happy to do anything I can, but I agree with you that the
  man would probably only be upset by the sight of me."</p>

  <p>"It is a great pity," said Pastor Childe regretfully. "I've known him now
  for seventeen years; in fact, I suppose I'm the oldest friend he has in
  Bulboro'. He has been a very competent worker," and with a conventional
  remark or two Pastor Childe toddled away to seek a more encouraging voter on
  whom he might exercise his blandishments.</p>

  <p>Geraldine Brand was making excellent progress. She was up now, and in a
  day or two she would be able to take carriage exercise.</p>

  <p>Anthony had seen very little of her since the operation; he had paid one
  or two necessary visits and had then handed the case over to Grimthorpe. Sir
  John asked him up to lunch and he availed himself of the opportunity without
  the hesitation which he usually displayed when invitations to luncheon came
  his way. He arrived at High Mount to discover the big oak-panelled hall
  filled with flowers, flowers in baskets of various degrees of ornamentation.
  Daffodils rooted in voluptuous splendour over the hall table, great masses of
  delicate-scented lilac, beribboned and becarded, were stocked about the
  armoured figures at the foot of the wide stairs, Easter lilies, violets, all
  the spring glories of England, were to be found amongst the tributes of
  susceptible youth to their stricken favourite.</p>

  <p>Sir John came out into the hall to greet him, and found Anthony admiring
  the blooms.</p>

  <p>"It looks as though we were running a flower-show, doesn't it?" he said,
  with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"What are these?" said Anthony. "Floral offerings from?"</p>

  <p>"From the young and the impressionable," said Sir John with a chuckle.
  "Every petal a sigh and each blossom a prayer."</p>

  <p>Anthony nodded. "I forgot those people. I suppose they were very much
  upset?"</p>

  <p>"My secretary was busy day and night answering their telegrams. It was an
  infernal nuisance, though of course it was awfully nice to know that my dear
  old Jerry is so immensely popular," he added.</p>

  <p>"Very," said Anthony, as he unfolded his napkin. "I wonder now that I
  dared to operate, remembering the revengeful <i>jeunesse dorée</i> who would
  have been thirsting for my blood, if anything had gone wrong."</p>

  <p>Sir John shuddered. "My dear chap, don't talk about anything going
  wrong."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said Anthony hastily; "but the thought is no less unpleasant
  to me&mdash;and I only express it from the safe distance of
  convalescence."</p>

  <p>"It was Jerry's idea sending for you," the baronet said after a while.
  "She's frightfully keen on you as a doctor."</p>

  <p>"I'm rather glad somebody's frightfully keen on me," confessed Anthony
  ruefully. "I'm certainly not the most popular man in Bulboro'."</p>

  <p>"I've been having a chat with your friend Cohen," said Sir John. "He's a
  most brilliant little man. I think he has a sporting chance of getting
  in."</p>

  <p>"Isn't there some prejudice against him as a Jew?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," hesitated the other. "The county, after all, is a very
  sporting county, and Cohen has none of the disagreeable characteristics of
  the Jew who has become suddenly rich. He is a pleasant type of a Jewish
  gentleman. The only regret I have," he said, a regret which found expression
  in his voice, "is that we can't rag the Nonconformists about their parson
  candidate. Stope is an engaging devil who contradicts the more exciting
  varieties of criticism."</p>

  <p>"I don't think that is a drawback," replied Anthony.</p>

  <p>After he had smoked a cigar with his host a message came from Geraldine
  that she was ready to see him, and he went up alone. She was sitting in a big
  chair drawn up to the window of her sitting-room. She looked exquisitely
  beautiful, he thought, and stood for a second in the doorway looking at her.
  She wore a dark blue kimono with patterns delicately worked in gold thread,
  and a touch of colour which a dull rose sash afforded threw the otherwise
  sombre garment into relief. Her hair was braided in two long plaits which
  hung over either shoulder. It made her look absurdly girlish, he thought;
  this was a new Geraldine Brand to the one he had known. He crossed to her and
  took her hand.</p>

  <p>"Thin and wasted by disease," she described it.</p>

  <p>"Your theories of recovery are working out splendidly," she said. "I can't
  realize I've had an operation. You must come along and operate any day you
  find time hanging on your hands."</p>

  <p>"Thank you so much," he said gravely.</p>

  <p>"Really I couldn't have imagined that anything like this could have
  happened, and that I could have survived it," she said wonderingly, and then
  as a thought struck her she turned to the little table at her side and
  searched for something about which she wanted to speak.</p>

  <p>"I've just had a letter from Beatrice&mdash;she's full of your
  praises."</p>

  <p>"That makes two people who have&mdash;" He stopped himself.</p>

  <p>"Two people who have&mdash;?" she asked mischievously.</p>

  <p>"Two people&mdash;I was going to say&mdash;" he stammered.</p>

  <p>"Exactly what embarrasses you, doctor?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The word "doctor" revived him.</p>

  <p>"What I intended saying when you interrupted me," he said severely, "was
  that you make the second person to-day who has been complimentary to me."</p>

  <p>"Who was the other?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"One of my patients," he said, with truth, "and I heard it at second
  hand."</p>

  <p>"You are speaking of me?" she challenged. "Now please don't deny it. I am
  always talking to daddy about you. In fact you are appointed my special
  surgeon&mdash;surgeon-in-ordinary, is that the phrase?"</p>

  <p>"Sergeant-surgeon, I think it is," he said, "and you will give me a
  baronetcy or something because I am so clever."</p>

  <p>She looked at him thoughtfully, too engrossed to be amused. "I have been
  hearing lots of things about you," she pursued. He looked at her half
  doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Lots of things" meant unpleasant things in his experience, particularly
  when they applied to him.</p>

  <p>"Which particular thing have you heard?" he asked. "Daddy told me about
  Gill."</p>

  <p>If he went very red it was in spite of himself Would the memory of that
  infernal error of his never be allowed to die the death?</p>

  <p>"Your daddy must be severely cautioned," he said. "To gossip with a
  delicate invalid and retail unpleasant truths about her doctor is to shake
  her confidence in his judgment."</p>

  <p>Still she was serious and was not to be diverted by his flippancy.</p>

  <p>"I am not going to say that you were wrong in what you did," she said;
  "but why were you so suddenly wrathful? I am sure he must have called other
  people by horrid names."</p>

  <p>"I'm blest if I know," said Anthony. "Let us get on to some other subject,
  will you? How do you feel?"</p>

  <p>She raised her finger warningly.</p>

  <p>"I beg of you not to ask questions as a friend which you are only
  privileged to ask as a doctor."</p>

  <p>"What are your plans?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We are going away to Nice. I want to see Beatrice on my way through
  Paris."</p>

  <p>"Is she still there?"</p>

  <p>The girl nodded.</p>

  <p>"It seems thousands of years," he said, "since I was in Paris."</p>

  <p>"Yet it is less than a month ago," she smiled.</p>

  <p>"Only a month. How ridiculous!" he said. "Things happen that obliterate
  all one's ideas of time."</p>

  <p>There was a new look in the eyes that examined his face so
  attentively.</p>

  <p>"What is the thing that has happened," she asked, "which has so destroyed
  your sense of proportion?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, many things," he answered vaguely. "For instance, the election."</p>

  <p>"That does not destroy your sense of time," said Jerry scornfully, "that
  only destroys your sense of veracity. What else?"</p>

  <p>"Let me say your operation," he suggested, with a show of
  extravagance.</p>

  <p>"Did that make any difference?"</p>

  <p>"In a sense, yes," he went on seriously. "I am not quite so callous as I
  probably shall be in a few years' time. When I see a young girl&mdash;as
  young as you&mdash;and as charming as you&mdash;with so perfectly splendid a
  future as I know you will have, when I see her in danger of her life, why,
  that makes all the difference, don't you know?" It was not a brilliant effort
  either in its lucidity or its consequence, but he was neither master of
  himself nor of the rules which govern English composition.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it does," she mused; "but then there must be many young people
  with whom you have been brought into contact, Dr. Manton, quite as young as
  I, and with futures just as promising. Did they&mdash;did they destroy your
  sense of time?"</p>

  <p>"I forget," he said; "it is so long ago since I had a patient as
  interesting as you, or as obedient," he said mischievously. She laid her hand
  upon his arm.</p>

  <p>"Did I"&mdash;she hesitated and flushed a deeper red&mdash;"did I say
  anything when I was under chloroform? I have a horrible fear that I was
  rather rude to you."</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, you did not utter a word until you came round from
  the anesthetic, though what you could have said that you would not care for
  all the world to know, Lord only knows."</p>

  <p>"I have a sort of dream memory," she persisted, "that II called you by
  your Christian name."</p>

  <p>"I have no recollection of the fact," lied Anthony nobly. "You may have
  sworn a little," he added gravely, "but such things we overlook."</p>

  <p>"There are lots of things that I should not care for the world to know,"
  she said. "Secrets are not a question of age, and I would have you
  understand, Dr. Manton, that I am a safe deposit of half the county's guilty
  confessions."</p>

  <p>"Boaster!" said Anthony, as he rose to go. "I suppose you will want me to
  certify you as fit to travel soon?"</p>

  <p>"I am going away next week," she said, as he took her hand, firm and warm
  despite her condition of convalescence.</p>

  <p>There was one of those little intervals of silence which are so charged
  with meaning when they occur between imaginative people.</p>

  <p>"I wish you luck and a quick recovery," he said.</p>

  <p>"Shan't I see you again?" she asked, as he was at the door. He
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I would like to see you before you go," he said.</p>

  <p>"Will you come up to tea on Wednesday?" she asked. He bowed.</p>

  <p>"That is the day following the election, and popular excitement will be
  sufficiently diminished to make the journey a safe one. Yes, I will."</p>

  <p>"You are not very keen about it," she challenged.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking that I must be rather a bore, and that you are asking me
  out of politeness."</p>

  <p>She laughed. It was good to hear the ring in that laugh again.</p>

  <p>"You cannot seriously imagine me doing things out of sheer politeness, can
  you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I could," he persisted.</p>

  <p>She was well enough to walk across the room to the door with him, and
  watched him go down the stairs into the hall. Half-way down she leant
  over.</p>

  <p>"Please don't destroy any more earnest Nonconformists, for my sake," she
  begged.</p>

  <p>He looked up with a guilty smile.</p>

  <p>"They are spared," he said, with mock solemnity, and went out into a world
  which had become a much brighter and more beautiful place.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Local feeling running very high," reported Sir John Brand,
  meeting Anthony on The Chad. "Here comes your pal Cohen. What is the state of
  the poll, Cohen?"</p>

  <p>The little man was smoking a big cigar, a copy of <i>The Times</i>
  newspaper was tucked away under his arm, and his grey bowler hat was on the
  back of his head. With his ready smile for all he met, he was the picture of
  cheer and content.</p>

  <p>"We are getting along," he said cautiously.</p>

  <p>"That is not very definite," replied Sir John, with a smile. "You ought to
  know exactly how you stand. This is the stage of an election when both
  candidates are sanguine of a majority."</p>

  <p>"I think we may get a small majority," said the other. "I hope you
  will."</p>

  <p>"Do you?" asked the other doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Of course. But don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Ambrose Cohen, taking out his cigar and examining the
  end of it severely. "I don't think it matters very much whether I get in or
  Stope."</p>

  <p>John Brand laughed and clapped the other on the shoulder. "Does anything
  matter very much?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't think it does," replied Cohen.</p>

  <p>Anthony raised his eyes to the heavens.</p>

  <p>"Listen to them," he implored. "Here we are on the brink of an election
  which is to be the death knell of the Government if you succeed, and you are
  openly confessing that it does not matter two straws which candidate
  wins."</p>

  <p>Whatever breadth of view Mr. Cohen displayed, or however philanthropical
  might be his outlook upon politics, his views were not shared either by his
  supporters or by the enthusiasts on the other side. The day before the
  polling there was something approaching a small riot, a riot which found its
  origin in the neighbourhood of Mr. Montague Silver's shop; for from being a
  most earnest Liberal and a supporter of all the institutional life of the
  town, Mr. Silver had so far fallen from grace as to address meetings on
  behalf of what he termed "the party of gentlemen and sportsmen." It may be
  said in extenuation of Mr. Silver, who had not been a speaker until he had
  learned the trick of oratory from his whilom friends, that he seldom
  addressed an audience unless he had made adequate preparation for the ordeal
  by a visit to the Blue Boar.</p>

  <p>So far the offensiveness had been all on one side. The abuse, the
  unrestrained deluge of mud which had been poured in considerable quantities
  over the other side, had owed its origin to the good Liberals of Bulboro'.
  Silver was an exponent in the new style of debate, and supplied a long-felt
  want in Bulboro'&mdash;a Tory demagogue, no less effective because he spoke
  under alcoholic stress. His speeches were delivered with charming directness,
  and at the end of his "greetings" he was usually escorted from his
  extemporized rostrum by such police as happened to be in the vicinity, and
  whose Homeric rushes to save him from his furious fellow-citizens were worthy
  of a better cause. To these gentlemen there can be no doubt that he owed his
  life for what it was worth. On the evening before the poll there was a free
  fight which ran from The Chad to Church Street, culminating in
  window-smashing on an extensive scale; a further incident of the evening was
  that a meeting which Mr. Childe had arranged to address in The Chad Lane
  mission-hall was rendered impossible by the presence of a very large and
  representative body of enlightened electors who came to offer passionate
  protest against any other form of light than that which illuminated their own
  views.</p>

  <p>Mr. Childe, however, enjoyed the experience. He was in the best of
  spirits, for he was to be the principal speaker of the last great meeting
  which Mr. Stope was holding, a meeting to be attended by a member of the
  Cabinet, Bexley no less, and to which the vast majority of Bulboro' people
  looked forward by the promise of Mr. Childe's address.</p>

  <p>For though Stope might be an eloquent speaker, an educated man, and a
  master of logical illustration, Childe was the admitted orator of the town,
  and his periods, perhaps a little less polished and a little less elegant,
  carried greater conviction and aroused a deeper interest than the utterances
  of any other man who would be present at that meeting.</p>

  <p>Anthony out of curiosity had written to Stope for a ticket. The presence
  of a Cabinet Minister had made it necessary that it should be a ticket
  meeting.</p>

  <p>The meeting was due to be held at the Royal Theatre, which had been taken
  for that night, and Mr. Stope very readily placed a box at Dr. Anthony
  Manton's disposal. Anthony spent the afternoon at home. He had a great deal
  of work to do, so much so that he was at this time considering the
  advisability of securing an assistant. The afternoon had turned out miserably
  and unpleasantly. Grey skies overhung Bulboro', sweeping mists of cloud hung
  low above the house-tops, shedding that fine rain which was a climatic
  peculiarity of the town.</p>

  <p>Anthony ate his solitary dinner and went back to his study. Rain was still
  falling, and it was not a night on which ordinarily he would venture out. But
  he was curious to hear Childe, of whose eloquence he had received abundant
  testimony.</p>

  <p>He was fated, however, to be deprived of that pleasure, for at seven
  o'clock, an hour and a half before the meeting was to begin, he was
  interrupted in his studies by the arrival of Westlake, a young doctor with a
  flourishing practice on the east side of the town.</p>

  <p>"Awfully sorry to bother you," apologized the intruder, "but I want to
  call you in. Pastor Childe thought I had better."</p>

  <p>"Who is it&mdash;Gill?" asked Anthony quickly.</p>

  <p>The other man nodded.</p>

  <p>"Take your coat off and sit down for a minute," invited Anthony, for the
  rough coat of the visitor was aglitter with moisture.</p>

  <p>"It is a beastly night," agreed Westlake, slipping the coat from his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with Gill?" asked Anthony. Westlake gave a significant
  little tilt of his chin.</p>

  <p>"Everything: throat septic, lungs septic&mdash;he's hopeless," he said. "I
  fancy there must have been some weakness there for a long time."</p>

  <p>"Is there any chance for him?" asked Anthony.</p>

  <p>Westlake shook his head as he tapped his cigarette on the mantelpiece.
  "Not an earthly," he said briefly. "We have done all we possibly can. We have
  used the needle, but without any beneficial result. I would like you to see
  him; you will be a bit surprised to learn that he is anxious to see you."</p>

  <p>"To see me?" asked Anthony in astonishment.</p>

  <p>The visitor nodded. He looked round the cosy study with an eye of
  approval.</p>

  <p>"What a lucky beggar you are," he said enviously, "to come right into such
  a stunning practice as this is, with all the cream of Bulboro' to skim. Here
  am I working my head off at a bob a visit."</p>

  <p>Anthony laughed. He had the most friendly feeling for men of his
  profession, and the envy of the other's tone was not of an aggressive
  character.</p>

  <p>"I am working my head off at less than a bob a visit," was his rejoinder,
  "but the patients have been falling off just lately."</p>

  <p>"The dispensary people?"</p>

  <p>Anthony nodded, and the other grinned his amusement.</p>

  <p>"Yes; they say you are a vivisectionist, amongst other unpleasant
  things&mdash;aren't they rum devils?"</p>

  <p>"Very," agreed Anthony heartily.</p>

  <p>It did not take him long to make his preparations. He had his car brought
  round, and together the two men drove through the town, striking, as it
  happened, the tail end of a most disorderly meeting which was emerging from
  Market Street Chapel School. They reached Gill's a few minutes after
  eight.</p>

  <p>Anthony will carry to the end of his days an impression of Mrs. Gill as
  one who spent her life in weeping; he had never seen her except in a
  condition of lachrymose misery. That she had reason enough he realized, and
  felt sorry for her now, in this moment of her supreme trial. If all that
  Westlake had said was true, the end must be very near; how near he saw for
  himself as he entered the little bedroom over the parlour. Gill lay in the
  centre of a large bed, breathing with difficulty, his eyes staring upwards at
  the ceiling, his white hands idly picking the threads of the bed-cover.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to see you so bad, Gill," said Anthony as he took the man's
  wrist in his hand.</p>

  <p>Gill nodded. Talking was a matter of some difficulty with him, and it
  seemed that, knowing how near he was to his end, he was conserving his scanty
  vitality for some final effort.</p>

  <p>Anthony had never overcome his sense of awe at the demonstrations of the
  great mystery of death, and now there arose in him a wave of pity for this
  fierce man whose fault was zeal, whose virtue was his faith.</p>

  <p>"You wanted to see me," said Anthony in that soft voice of his which few
  had heard him employ.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Gill painfully. "Lying here, doctor, I have understood how my
  pride and my arrogance have led me astray. I am only a feeble, pitiful
  sinner, perhaps more of a sinner than some of the people I have been
  condemning. Somehow it was hard to think I was wrong," he went on
  reflectively. He spoke with long intervals of silence between each little
  group of words. "Hard to say I am wrong. I never knew what terrible pride
  there was in my heart until God in His merciful wisdom laid me upon this bed
  of sickness. I have been uncharitable, doctor. I wonder if you can forgive
  me."</p>

  <p>"You have been no more uncharitable than I," said Anthony, laying his
  hands upon the other's. "We are all human beings, Gill, and uncharity seems
  the first law of nature, because it is difficult to be charitable and
  preserve oneself&mdash;it is I who am owed forgiveness."</p>

  <p>Gill looked up at him, searching his face earnestly.</p>

  <p>"I wanted that off my mind," he said. "I praise God that He sent in you
  one who was strong enough to check me in my evil career. Yes, evil it was."
  He nodded slowly to emphasize his words. "And now that I am so close to the
  mercy-seat of God"&mdash;he smiled the happy smile of the weary man near to
  his rest&mdash;"I feel more peaceful and more happy than ever I have felt in
  my life, Dr. Manton. It is a wonderful sense of peace," he said half to
  himself, "after all the care and the labour of life; it makes death almost
  bearable, and all else than death petty and small and unworthy of effort. I
  sent for my little boy to-day," he said, "the little boy whom in my wrath and
  to my shame I so deeply wronged. He came this afternoon, and it seemed that I
  only wanted to see you, doctor, and perhaps Lady Heron Wendall, to make all
  things well." He spoke with difficulty. "God will send her my message, and
  she will know that this poor penitent heart of mine waxed humble at the
  end."</p>

  <p>He spoke with increasing labour, and Anthony went to the door to summon
  Westlake, though he knew that nothing could be done for him Gill beckoned him
  back. His face was pinched and drawn, and his lips were blue.</p>

  <p>"Tell my dear pastor," he whispered, and a smile that was beautiful to see
  shone upon his face; "say to that beloved man of God that I need him now, for
  I stand in the valley of the shadow of death."</p>

  <p>Anthony stole from the room, and downstairs he saw Westlake and sent him
  to the patient.</p>

  <p>His car was waiting at the door. He remembered that the pastor was
  speaking at the theatre and, looking at his watch, he knew the meeting would
  have just begun. He went as fast as his car could do the short distance, and
  made his way to the stage-door.</p>

  <p>The doorkeeper recognized him and touched his hat.</p>

  <p>"Is Pastor Childe on the stage?" asked Anthony quickly.</p>

  <p>"Just going on, sir," said the doorkeeper. "There is a tremendous house,"
  he went on enthusiastically. "The pastor won't half get a reception
  to-night."</p>

  <p>Anthony traversed the narrow passage-ways under the stage, climbed a steep
  flight of stairs, and came to the stage level.</p>

  <p>The theatre was packed from ceiling to floor. Anthony saw this across the
  glare of the footlights from where he stood. The chairman had finished his
  introductory remarks, and Pastor Childe was standing in the wings ready to
  enter. He had a sense of the theatrical strongly developed, and understood
  the value of an entrance as well as the oldest and most wily of tragedians.
  The house was calling for him, and the smile on his face was indicative of
  the pleasure he felt in this popular tribute. "Childe! Childe! Childe!" they
  were shouting monotonously from the auditorium, and already smiling faces
  were turned from the stage to where Childe waited. He had taken one step
  forward when Anthony caught him by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Pastor," he said hurriedly, "I want a word with you." Childe looked with
  an exclamation of annoyance.</p>

  <p>"Not now, my dear fellow," he said; "I am just going on to make my
  speech."</p>

  <p>"But this is important," Anthony said, speaking rapidly, "more important
  than your speech&mdash;Gill is dying."</p>

  <p>"Dying!" said Childe. "You don't mean that?"</p>

  <p>"I do, indeed," replied the doctor. "He has sent for you, and he wants
  you."</p>

  <p>"But I cannot come now," said the pastor. He spread out his hands
  helplessly. "How can I? I am due to make a speech here, and I must make it. I
  will come directly I have finished"</p>

  <p>"He will be dead by then," said Anthony brutally. "You see," he drawled as
  he invariably did when he was being wilfully offensive, "this unfortunate man
  is under the impression that you are gifted by God with a certain
  super-power; he is also going out of this life in the vain imagination that a
  pastor, a disciple of God, a man of Christ, call it what you will, has only
  one job in life, and that it is the salvation of souls and the helping of the
  helpless over hard places. He does not know, of course, that a pastor can be
  a hell of a speaker, or that he can desire the applause of a theatre-load of
  rabid politicians more than he can wish for the thanks of a man going out to
  the darkness of death. Listen." He dropped his hands upon the pastor's
  shoulders, and gripped them, looking down at the man's face. His voice was
  vibrant with indignant anger&mdash;an anger which dominated him as nothing
  else had done in his life. "Do you believe, Pastor Childe, that there is such
  a thing as God? Do you believe that Christ was the Son of God and came into
  this world to save sinful men? Do you believe it to be true, or is it a lie
  faked upon which a most prosperous business has been founded? It is either
  one or the other, my man. Either you are a liar, and every action and word of
  you is a lie, and the whole of your life a black and bitter sham, or else you
  are doing a monstrous thing in leaving this man to go out of life without the
  comfort he desires."</p>

  <p>They were still shouting from the audience. Stope saw there was some
  trouble, and leaving his seat, hurriedly came to the wings.</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is nothing," said Anthony, with a hard laugh; "only I was trying
  to persuade Pastor Childe to go to Mr. Gill. He is dying, but Pastor Childe
  is so full of his speech that Gill, who loves him and trusts him more than
  any human being in the world, must die alone&mdash;that is all."</p>

  <p>"My dear chap," said Stope, "you must be a little reasonable. The pastor
  will not be more than twenty minutes."</p>

  <p>"He can be twenty hours as far as I am concerned," said Anthony roughly,
  and, turning his back upon the stage, he walked out of the theatre.</p>

  <p>The audience rose as the pastor came slowly to, the centre of the stage.
  They rose and cheered the stout man with the large, genial face and the curly
  hair.</p>

  <p>But these cheers awoke no response in him He stood, his hands clasped
  before him, his face pale and his lips atremble. They thought he was overcome
  by the warmth of his reception and cheered all the louder, stamping their
  feet to add volume to the din of approval. Presently they were silent and his
  speech commenced. As it proceeded the privileged people on the platform
  looked at one another in amazement. Was this the orator of
  Bulboro'&mdash;this lame-speaking man with his stammering, nervous delivery,
  his halting illustrations, his toneless denunciations of a conventional
  enemy?</p>

  <p>Sitting behind him, leaning back in his chair, his arms folded, one hand
  caressing his chin, Stope knew. He knew, and knowing, made a rapid review
  which comprehended motives and consequences. He made up his mind long before
  Childe, and to Stope's face, as he saw his way clearly marked, came a look of
  infinite relief. Western, sitting amongst his reporters, saw that look and
  wondered. It was as though the candidate had heard through some invisible
  agency the most wonderful and most cheering of messages. It was
  incomprehensible, for Childe was floundering through a speech which was
  almost painful to listen to. Then he suddenly stopped and covered his face
  with his hands. They thought he was ill, and a deadly silence fell upon the
  assembly. Stope had risen and had gone swiftly to the speaker's side.</p>

  <p>"Childe," he said in a low voice, "if God has spoken to you as He has
  spoken to me, there is great work for us in Bulboro'." The other nodded. He
  took his hands from his face, and they saw that he had suddenly gone old. He
  raised his hand to the audience and the little buzz of excited conversation
  which had broken forth as the two men spoke, was hushed.</p>

  <p>"I desire the prayers of all men for my friend John Gill," he said
  brokenly, "whom I failed this night in the hour of his dire
  necessity&mdash;whom I deserted for my own profit and my own
  advancement...God have mercy on me."</p>

  <p>And before the breathless throng he wept.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Half an hour later Pastor Childe drove hurriedly to the door
  of Gill's house. It was opened by Dr. Westlake. "You have come a little too
  late, pastor," he said, "Gill has gone."</p>

  <p>"Did he speak of me?" asked the pastor huskily.</p>

  <p>"He asked for nobody else; he was conscious till the very last second. I
  am sorry you could not come."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, too," muttered the other, and went homewards a humbled
  man.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19">XIX. &mdash; A VISION OF HAPPINESS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"And what did Bexley say about it?" asked Anthony. He was
  fulfilling his promise to take tea with Geraldine, and they were sitting in
  the big library at High Mount, a pleasing fire of logs crackling on the
  hearth and the vision of Geraldine officiating at the tea-table to complete
  the engaging picture. Every day was making a difference to her now, and her
  improvement even during this week was a testimony alike to her constitution
  and the happy order of her mind.</p>

  <p>"Bexley saw it was uncanny," she replied, holding up a piece of sugar with
  an inquiring lift of the brow. "One? Yes, uncanny, that was Bexley's own
  word. It was awful rough luck on the Government, because the seat was sure,
  but Stope gave it away. You see," this very wisely, "you can't tell a fervid
  audience that whilst you will go to Parliament if you are sent, you'd just as
  soon stay on in Bulboro' attending to the souls of your fellow-creatures,
  without losing a lot of support, because to a lot of people the kind of
  Member of Parliament a man is going to get, is ever so much more important
  than the place in heaven somebody else is going to get, and that speech lost
  Stope his place, in Westminster."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't seem depressed," said Anthony. "I saw him an hour ago, and he
  was awfully cheerful. He is going to re-establish the Sunday School, and he
  is cutting politics right out. Stope is a finer man than I thought."</p>

  <p>"And Childe?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"And Childe also," he agreed. "He was splendid last night&mdash;it takes
  little short of a hero to come out as he did&mdash;I have been rather hasty
  in my judgment of Childe."</p>

  <p>There was laughter in the grey eyes of Geraldine Brand as she surveyed
  him; there was a whole world of kindness, too.</p>

  <p>"Is Bulboro' going to discover that it has been hasty about you?" she
  asked half seriously. "Will it ever learn to whom it owes the conversion of
  Mr. Stope and the pastor?"</p>

  <p>"To whom it owes?" He was genuinely puzzled.</p>

  <p>"They say you bullied Mr. Childe into penitence."</p>

  <p>He went red. She had the power of making him feel extremely
  embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you realize," she went on quietly, "how much of a reformer
  you are, or how devoted a Christian you are either."</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense!" the uncomfortable Anthony wriggled uneasily; "I'm not a
  Christian&mdash;I'm next door to heathenism." She met his eyes and he held
  them.</p>

  <p>"Yet I am glad you have illusions about me," he went on slowly, "and it
  requires an effort on my part to undeceive you."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>He made no direct response, and she repeated the question as a woman will,
  who knows as she asks that the answer is one to be feared and courted.</p>

  <p>"Because I rather think&mdash;I love you," he said, and she dropped her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>They did not speak for a long time, then she held out her hand shyly and
  he took it.</p>

  <p>"Write to me when I am away," she said, and raised her lips to his.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A discontented Ahmet called upon his master in the morning
  following the return to Parliament of Ambrose Cohen by the slender majority
  of seven, and Ahmet had a complaint to make.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he said, "I have served you many months in this terrible city, and
  though I have made you coffee and you have spoken good words to me, I am
  tired and desire to return to my own people."</p>

  <p>"This is sudden," said Anthony in Arabic. "Why are you weary of this
  land?"</p>

  <p>"There are very good reasons, lord," said the man. "First, there is no
  woman here whom I care for, for as your lordship knows, it is
  forbidden&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That I know," said Anthony hastily; "but why do you not wait a little
  longer, Ahmet?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, this is a cold place, and very uncomfortable."</p>

  <p>"But soon the summer will be here," humoured Anthony, "and the flowers put
  a new heart into you."</p>

  <p>But Ahmet shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I do not like these people," he persisted, "nor the fat man of your house
  who is full of solemn words, nor the fat woman who cooks."</p>

  <p>"Yet wait," said Anthony, "for who knows what the morrow brings forth;
  leave it with God, Ahmet"</p>

  <p>Ahmet grunted and went away. He had in some mysterious manner learned that
  Mr. Jocks was a little less than polite in the language he used to him, for
  Mr. Jocks, depending entirely upon the heathen's ignorance of the elements of
  the English language, had not chosen his epithets with care, and Ahmet, who
  had occupied his time wisely during his leisure hours, had picked up
  sufficient English to reply, on the first occasion which offered, in the
  spirit in which he was addressed. It was unfortunate that Ahmet's language
  was very crude and unacceptable even to an English manservant. Jocks had
  reported the matter, and Anthony had soothed him down. "You are sure you were
  not rude to him?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I was not knowingly offensive to Ahmet," replied Jocks carefully. "I may
  have been a little comic."</p>

  <p>The spectacle of a comic Jocks appealed to Anthony, but he kept a serious
  face.</p>

  <p>"I only want to warn you," he said, "that Ahmet is picking up English at a
  rapid rate, as you discovered this morning, and you cannot expect to say even
  comic things to him with impunity. I thought I heard you the other day," he
  went on carelessly, "addressing him in terms which were not in keeping with
  the dignity of a God-fearing butler, Mr. Jocks."</p>

  <p>Mr. Jocks was taken aback.</p>

  <p>"I was not aware," he stammered, "that I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know you were not," said Anthony. "I was wandering about the garden,
  and unfortunately I happened to be in the neighbourhood of the kitchen window
  without my being aware of the fact until I heard your voice&mdash;and your
  kitchen manners. Anyway, no great harm is done. Leave Ahmet alone. These
  Moors are very bad men to make enemies of, as you probably know."</p>

  <p>Thereafter a new terror was added to Mr. Jocks's life.</p>

  <p>He was aware that all black people were more or less barbarians, and that
  the barbarian equivalent for what in England is assault and battery, is, in
  the wilder parts of the world, something nearly approaching wilful murder.
  Also that foreigners used knives of a peculiar and bloodthirsty pattern.</p>

  <p>From that day Mr. Jocks became a little more deferential, and Ahmet, as he
  realized the change, a trifle more insolent, and the strange relationship had
  ended by Jocks being chased through the orchard by a wrathful Arab, knife in
  hand.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Anthony had been at hand to call off the vengeful man, and he
  had addressed a few remarks concerning Ahmet and his ancestry which,
  translated, might well have placed the worthy young doctor in the category of
  Bulboro's impossible people.</p>

  <p>Thereafter Ahmet nursed a grudge against all the world, and the outcome of
  his unhappiness was his application to be released from the service to return
  to his beloved Coast. Though Mr. Jocks had frequently referred to his
  intention of retiring from a position which no longer offered him the
  opportunities of yore, he was by no means anxious to surrender a good job
  where the pay was excellent, and the work not particularly hard. But now for
  the first time in his life he began to ponder the problem of retirement,
  Ahmet being the main cause.</p>

  <p>Anthony, watching the trend of events, saw with regret that he would have
  to return his wilful servant to his native home, though he would miss the
  coffee which only Ahmet could make. Ahmet was one of his vanities; he
  realized this with a start. He had brought him as his servant because he
  resented in a dim kind of way being transplanted from his unique isolation
  into the association of ordinary men. The attachment of Ahmet to himself had
  been typical of that spirit of superiority which he had brought to Bulboro'.
  It was, when he came to consider the matter logically, just as absurd for him
  to have imported a native of the Coast to make his coffee as it would have
  been had he taken a fat English cook to the Congo because she was an adept in
  the preparation of beef-steak pudding. Against that point of view (so he
  argued in desperation, since no man cares to admit to himself a weakness,
  which, if it were true, might conceivably be apparent to the rest of the
  world) was the fact that he had had Ahmet as his servant for some four or
  five years. But he had had other servants equally useful. He had had a Kroo
  boy who could have assisted him in his scientific work. No, he reluctantly
  admitted, he had retained Ahmet because he was picturesque. Now Ahmet was
  making himself a nuisance; and an hour after he urged his turbulent servant
  to exercise patience, he sent for the man, and Ahmet came a little
  sulkily.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Ahmet," said Anthony, with a smile, "when this moon is gone you go in
  a ship across the black waters for your own land."</p>

  <p>"God be praised," said Ahmet, "for I am tired of this land where there is
  neither sun nor beauty. But you, my lord, do you go also?"</p>

  <p>Anthony shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I stay," he said, "there being much work to do here."</p>

  <p>Ahmet looked thoughtfully at his master, and twiddled his bare
  toes&mdash;he invariably left his slippers at the door.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I do not go far," he said; "and it has been told me by the Christ
  man that by the favour of God I might pass across land to my
  destination."</p>

  <p>"To whither?" asked Anthony, and looked up in surprise. "To Tangier,"
  replied the man promptly, "for that is my home, lord."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Ahmet, you may go to Tangier. There is no reason why you
  should not," said Anthony. "But what of your friends on the Coast?"</p>

  <p>Ahmet smiled broadly. "Lord," said he, without shame, "those on the Coast
  I do not like any more, for I have thought of them for a long time, and
  behold, it has been revealed to me that they are not good people."</p>

  <p>"But wherefore?" asked Anthony, interested.</p>

  <p>"Anito," said the man, giving him his Coast name, "of my faith there are
  two classes, the Suni and the Shiah, and I am of the Suni, worshipping God in
  the true way, and believing in certain revelations which were not made to
  these other dogs."</p>

  <p>Anthony laughed. "Get out," he said, "you beastly sectarian."</p>

  <p>Ahmet departed a few days later. He left by the train which carried
  Geraldine Brand to London, and Anthony was able to combine a pleasure with a
  duty.</p>

  <p>Geraldine was going on to the South of France for a much-needed change,
  and her travelling companion was Sir John.</p>

  <p>"And I can wish for no one nicer," said Geraldine gaily. "Daddy is an
  ideal travelling companion."</p>

  <p>Daddy, who had been a charming travelling companion to so many, smiled,
  and found it convenient to move off to the bookstall to buy the magazines
  which Geraldine had indicated.</p>

  <p>"I shall miss you," said Anthony quite naturally, and wondered why he had
  said so banal a thing.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you will not miss me as much as you pretend," she laughed,
  but there was a serious look in her lovely grey eyes.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why I should miss you," he said half to himself. "I have
  seen so little of you, but somehow the knowledge that you were in Bulboro'
  was enough."</p>

  <p>"Enough for what?" she challenged.</p>

  <p>"Enough to satisfy so humble a soul as mine"</p>

  <p>"Are you so humble?" she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"I think I am getting to be that way," he answered. "You see, it has been
  borne in upon me that I am rather a prig, and I am trying to convert myself
  to a more lowly frame of mind. There goes my last affectation." He pointed to
  the tarboshed head of Ahmet, which was stuck out of a third-class carriage
  regarding the interested spectators on the platform with amusement and, it
  must be confessed, no small derision.</p>

  <p>"My last affectation," he said again; "he goes back to Tangier and to
  happiness."</p>

  <p>"It would be pleasant to know that happiness lay at the end of a railway
  journey," she said, looking at him absently.</p>

  <p>"If one could only take a ticket to happiness! That would never pay the
  railway companies," he smiled; "there would be very few return tickets
  issued."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she said; "poor humanity is never satisfied, and sitting
  in the happy valley one may well regret the faraway plains."</p>

  <p>There was a little silence, which she broke.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," she asked thoughtfully, "whether your life is not so full
  already, that if you could find happiness at the end of a railway journey you
  would trouble to take even the single ticket?"</p>

  <p>"I think I should," he said quietly, looking up into her face, "and I
  think I might find it in a very humble way."</p>

  <p>"That is twice you have used the word humble," she smiled; "it is a word
  which comes oddly from you. Exactly, what is your idea of taking your
  pleasures humbly?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he said, avoiding her eyes, "I could make holiday in some
  southern place, where in a quiet hotel, with a big garden full of roses at
  this season of the year, a man might find rest. And every day I could stroll
  on the quay by the blue sea, and presently I should be rewarded perhaps by
  the most beautiful sight that any man could wish to see&mdash;the vision of a
  sweet, brave, English girl walking in the sunshine, effacing the memories of
  a bad-tempered doctor man who once was over-bold. I should not intrude upon
