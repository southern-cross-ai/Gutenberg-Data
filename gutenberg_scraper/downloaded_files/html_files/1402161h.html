<p>A new Edition of this Work being required, the author has
availed himself of the opportunity to correct such errata as were
occasioned by his not personally inspecting the proof sheets of
the First Edition. Some new facts have also been added which he
thinks will increase the interest and usefulness of his Work; but
he has not considered himself authorized to introduce all that he
has subsequently heard respecting regions of which such
contradictory reports have been published, as his object is to
impart information collected by himself and verified by actual
observation alone.</p>

<h3>PREFACE<br>
<br>
TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h3>
<br>
<hr class="tenth">
<br>
<p><span class="aa">An</span> inherent propensity to wander, and,
not improbably, some slight wish to secure a share in the golden
prospects held out to all persons emigrating to the Australian
Colonies, induced me, once more to encounter the perils of the
deep, and to bid adieu, for a time, to those luxuries and
comforts so much prized by all who love a life of
tranquillity.</p>
<p>A sojourn in the Colonies, however it may have gratified my
roving propensities, and afforded much real interest and
amusement, has certainly tended to dispel some of the bright
illusions with which the high-flown accounts of not a few writers
on the subject had previously possessed my mind. It must be
obvious to every impartial person, who has had an opportunity of
judging from actual observation of the capabilities of the
Colonies, that most of the works hitherto published are
calculated to excite in the emigrant expectations which, unless
through some singularly lucky circumstance, can never be
realized: in addition to which, they certainly convey but little
of that practical information so necessary to all who intend
establishing themselves in those distant regions.</p>
<p>It is with this conviction that I have been induced to offer
to the public the substance of my note-book, trusting that it
will be found to convey an impartial and correct, though brief
and unvarnished account, of the actual state of things in this
portion of the globe.</p>
<p>I lay no claim to the graces of authorship, nor in a work of
this kind, would there have been much opportunity for displaying
them; the only object I have in view is, to convey as aqcurate an
idea as possible of the nature and resources of the different
settlements; so that, in the event of the emigrant undertaking a
voyage of nearly 16,000 miles, he may not find, on his arrival at
his destination, that he has been misled by over-drawn accounts
or actual misstatements.</p>
<p>This, I regret to say, has been the case with many, who,
judging from what they had read, quitted England with the notion,
that the countries to which they were proceeding comprised in
them all the delights of a paradise!</p>
<p>It is perfectly natural to believe all that is said of a
country by a respectable person who has been there, especially
when he has no apparent motive for making mis-statements; but
some travellers show a most singular aptitude to amplify as much
as possible, particularly with respect to the beauties of a
country; seemingly from the supposition, that unless a book be
full of high-flown language, it would not be read: others, again,
owing to their not having had any opportunities of visiting other
regions, can be but little qualified to take a fair and correct
view of the relative advantages and disadvantages of a
country.</p>
<p>I believe no persons have written on the Colonies who have not
been in some way connected, it may be said identified, with one
or other of them; and it cannot, therefore, excite surprise if
they say all they can in favour of that particular colony in
which they haf e established themselves. I mean not to accuse
them of wilful misrepresentation; but they certainly appear, in
too many instances, to have been influenced by that <i>amor
patriæ</i>, that devotion to their adopted country, which,
lending to every thing an enchantment it possesses not for the
casual and indifferent observer, but ill qualifies them for
giving a faithful and unbiassed account of it.</p>
<p>Having, during my wanderings, visited, and, I trust, not quite
unprofitably, many parts of the globe, I may perhaps be allowed
to hope, in giving a concise description of regions so little
known in England, that I shall be enabled to impart useful
information to those who propose to emigrate, and also to prove
the truth of the observations made by Pliny the elder, "That no
book is so bad as not to afford something valuable."</p>

<p><span class="aa">Ships</span> bound to the Australian colonies
sail at all times of the year; but it is by no means an easy
matter to ascertain the precise period fixed for their departure;
for such is the anxiety of the agents to secure passengers, that
they will not hesitate to state a positive time, although well
aware that the vessel may not sail for many weeks afterwards.</p>
<p>It is therefore advisable to withhold the passage money until
the vessel is in a state of forwardness for sea, which can only
be ascertained by a person going himself on board, and finding
out what portion of the cargo is shipped: if he cannot do so
personally, he should employ a friend to act for him. Without
taking this precaution, the emigrant may be detained in London,
at very great expense, and during a considerable time: indeed I
know of one instance in which a family were induced, through the
misrepresentations of an agent, to go from Aberdeen to London,
where, after having made their arrangements and paid their
passage-money, they were detained <i>three months</i>.</p>
<p>The amount of the passage-money varies greatly, but the
following may be taken as the average:</p>
<table summary="p 2" align="center" width="70%">
<colgroup>
<col width="35%">
<col width="35%"></colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Cabin, from</td>
<td>80<i>l</i>. to 90<i>l</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stern Cabin</td>
<td>40<i>l</i>. to 50<i>l</i>. extra.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Steerage</td>
<td>20<i>l</i>. to 30<i>l</i>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The freight for baggage, &amp;c. taken in the hold, is from
2<i>l</i>. 15<i>s</i>. to 3<i>l</i>. per ton.</p>
<p>The average passage to Sydney and Hobart Town is about four
months, and to Swan River about three weeks less.</p>
<p>Previous to securing his passage, the emigrant will do well to
ascertain that the ship is commanded by a person of known credit
and responsibility; he will thus be secure against those disputes
respecting fare, etc. etc., which add so much to the inevitably
numerous inconveniences of such a long voyage.</p>
<p>Some persons consider the passage-money to be extravagant, but
they do not reflect that the style of living will most probably
be greatly superior to that to which they have been accustomed on
shore; many also imagine, that on board ship, the time must of
necessity pass very heavily, which is altogether a mistake; for
it is really inconceivable with what rapidity weeks, nay months,
seem to disappear during a voyage, especially if a person be
moderately partial to literary pursuits. The very regularity, or,
as it is termed, monotony, of the life one leads, tends to make
the days appear short; and when it is considered how many sources
of recreation are supphed by reading, chess, etc., it is but
seldom that any one, save the mere idler, will find the day too
long. If there should be any person, who, instead of employing
his time rationally, thinks of nothing but eating and drinking,
no uncommon circumstance, he may expect to feel enough of the
<i>tædium vitæ</i> to make him wish himself on shore again.</p>
<p>Not a few are alarmed at the supposed dangers of the voyage:
it might possibly instil some degree of courage into the most
timid, if they would but take into consideration the small size
and badly found condition of the vessels in which the early
navigators encountered the storms of which they speak.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* When Diaz discovered the Cape of Good Hope, he
had only two vessels, 50 tons each; this was in 1446! Those of De
Gama, who discovered India, were 120, 100, and 90 tons. In
Drake's voyage round the world, he had with him one vessel of
100, one of 80, one of 50, one of 30, and a pinnace of 15 tons!!
Candish or Cavendish, in his voyage round the world, had three
vessels of the respective burdens of 140, 60, and 40 tons!
Columbus' fleet consisted of three carracks, each of 100 tons,
and iundry vessels of much smaller size.]</p>
<p>I have been twice to New Holland (and a friend of mine four
times) without having experienced aught resembling a gale of
wind! Even off Cape Horn, when returning to England, at the
commencement of the winter, the weather was truly
delightful.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** It is not to be inferred from this that we
had not, during the voyage an occasional strong breezy, but then
it was commonly favourable: at all events we were not prevented
from making some progress.]</p>
<p>Previous to our reaching the Cape the weather had been thick
and gloomy, so that for thirteen days we never saw the moon, and
very littlfe of the sun; but old ocean, during that period, was
so uncommonly smooth, that we were almost led to believe
ourselves close under the lee of the land, instead of being at
some distance from it, with sometimes a fresh breeze blowing
right on shore. We were quite unable to account for this; there
was just such a ripple as is frequently observed on the surface
of a lake, but not the slightest perceptible swell. This was
fortunate, as we sailed nearly five hundred miles amongst ice
islands, the first of which was seen in latitude 55° 13' south,
longitude 115° 45' west. They were mostly at a distance of
several miles from each other, with small broken fragments
between them: the greatest number seen at one time exceeded
twenty, and the most considerable may have been half a mile in
length, and two hundred feet, or upwards, in height. The
principal danger, when amongst ice, arises from the small pieces,
which, during a dense fog, are not perceived until the vessel is
nearly upon them: the larger masses or islands, may generally be
distinguished by the "blink."</p>
<p>Those who wish to touch at Rio Janeiro, on their way to the
Colonies, will do well to sail early in April: but if they prefer
the Cape of Good Hope, about the middle or end of August, as
there will then be a greater probability of their making a good
passage; besides which, they will arrive at the Cape in the fine
season, a point of great consequence in such a boisterous
region.</p>
<p>Ships appear, however, to touch more commonly at the Cape Verd
Islands: on my first voyage, we passed a couple of days at the
Island of Mayo, and on my second we put into Porto Praya; at the
former we procured nothing but water and salt, and at the latter
various fruits, and some poultry.</p>
<p>If the emigrant has any articles of value at all liable to
become damaged, they should be in cases lined with tin; and in
order to keep his trunks, etc. free from damp, he had better
place them on stands, so as to raise them a few inches from the
deck; they can afterwards be secured in the usual manner.</p>
<p>Seeds are put up in several ways; some persons enclose them in
cannisters, or boxes of coarse sugar; others in tin soldered up.
From experience, I consider it a good plan to pack them in brown
paper, and then to suspend them in the cabin. I had heard that it
was necessary to exclude the air entirely, and therefore tried
the experiment; yet most of the seeds failed. Cuttings can be
carried in boxes in the following manner: first put in a layer of
mould, then one of cuttings, and so on alternately, until the box
is filled; nail it down tight, and keep it from wet.</p>
<p>Bulbous roots may be hung up in paper bags; and all the care
that they require, is to be occasionally cleared of any insects
that may be on them.</p>
<p>Plants are often packed in moss, as cuttings are in mould; and
I have seen them brought out in this manner, and succeed
perfectly well. But the more usual mode is to have boxes fitted
on purpose, in which case the glass should be protected by a wire
grating. In spite, however, of all the trouble that may have been
expended upon the plants, many of them will perish before the
expiration of the voyage; but many will also reach their
destination in excellent condition. They frequently die in
consequence of the box not being closed in stormy weather, so
that the plants are destroyed by the spray. They must not be
watered too often.</p>
<p>There is not a tree or plant that will grow in Europe that
will not also thrive well in one or other of the three colonies;
and such, likewise, is the case with a great number of exotics.
The emigrant ought certainly to take out both cuttings and seeds
of every description. In a country like New Holland, every
deciduous tree, in particular, is valuable. He will perhaps say
he has already enough to attend to, without hampering himself
with so many packages; but he may rest assured, that the trouble
and expense are so trifling, as not to be worth mentioning.</p>
<p>He will most probably, on his arrival, have no place in which
to put his plants, etc., in this case, he can give them to the
botanical garden, and the superintendent will at any time supply
him with those he may require when on his location.</p>
<p>I have several times, to my no small astonishment, met with
persons who were going to Australasia professedly with the view
of becoming settlers, and who, nevertheless, had not supplied
themselves with a plant or seed of any kind. This must have been
through idleness or carelessness, neither of which is very
creditable. I tried to introduce the goldfinch and sky lark; and
Dr. F., who, in each of his voyages has exerted himself greatly
to introduce both birds and plants, took on board, when he last
went out, two-dozen linnets, and three dozen goldfinches; he
landed three of the latter, and I saved two larks, but both
males. Here we both committed a mistake, in having too many birds
in one cage; for I had fourteen goldfinches in the same cage, and
the Doctor thirty-six. In flying about they destroyed each other,
and they also fought most desperately.</p>
<p>The proper, and in fact the only way, is to have a large
wicker cage divided into compartments, and to keep two birds,
male and female, in each, but with one general slide, so as to
avoid the necessity of cleaning each cage or compartment
separately. Singing birds, provided they are not of the kind
which destroy grain or young fruit, (and even if they did, the
loss would be trifling) would be a great acquisition to the
Colonies, as they would tend to break, during a portion of the
year, the horrid silence which so often reigns in the vast
forests of New Holland and Van Dieman's Land.</p>
<p>Our voyage to St. Jago, one of the Cape Verd Islands, was
tolerably rapid, and we found there two ships which had sailed
from England ten days before us, and yet had only arrived one day
sooner.</p>
<p>We anchored at Porto Praya, the principal town of the island,
and a party of us immediately went on shore. The landing is
always indifferent, frequently very bad, and even dangerous. On
my former visit to this place in a frigate, one of our boats was
upset, and some of the crew were nearly drowned. On landing we
had to walk along a sandy beach, and across a valley which
extends to the port, and contains a few wretched looking trees;
then ascending a steep acclivity by a bad road cut out of the
rock, we found ourselves in the town. It consists of a large
square, one rather wide street, and a few lateral streets of a
miserable appearance, and stands upon a bold rocky projection,
elevated considerably above the sea, with a valley on each side,
and bare hills and barren valleys behind. From it, with the
exception of the above mentioned trees on the one side, and a few
acres of garden ground and thick wood in the valley on the other,
the eye looks over a region as bare and desolate as can possibly
be imagined; in short, no spot I ever saw can, in apparent
sterility be compared to it. Most of the inhabitants are
blacks.</p>
<p>From the town we walked a mile and a half to inspect some
springs, and found there a good garden belonging to one of the
merchants, and also a copious supply of excellent water, which
flowed from beneath a rock. It is from hence that the government
propose laying down pipes, in order to supply the shipping, and
also the town, so as not to be under the necessity of depending,
as is the case at present, on a well, inconveniently situated in
a valley three quarters of a mile from the beach.</p>
<p>Quitting the springs, we continued our walk, over loose lava
without a blade of grass, and scarcely a plant of any kind, to a
ravine called Trinidad.</p>
<p>Here, however, the vegetation was truly luxuriant, and fruit
of various kinds, particularly oranges, lemons, grapes, bananas,
and cocoa-nuts, together with sugar canes, coffee, etc., were
extremely abundant. We saw also the tree commonly called, in
Western Africa, the monkey-fruit, the adansonia of botanists; one
which we measured was forty-two feet in girth.</p>
<p>The ravine, for it can hardly be termed a valley, is really a
beautiful spot; but it will bear no comparison with another
called St. Domingo, some miles beyond it, which I visited at a
former period. The last is nine miles from the town; and on our
way to it we passed occasionally the bed of a mountain stream,
but found not one drop of water. The ravine is rendered highly
romantic and interesting, as it is of some extent, and enclosed
by lofty rocks of a bold and picturesque appearance; the effect
of which (together with the cultivation) is greatly heightened by
the contrast with the gloomy and unpromising aspect of the
country around. St. Jago is ten miles long and five wide.</p>
<p>From July, 1830, to the time of my visit&mdash;that is to say,
<i>twenty-two months</i>&mdash;not more than half an inch of rain
had fallen in St. Jago; and this had also been the case in some
of the other islands of this group. The consequences have been
highly disastrous, and many of the inhabitants have perished
through want.</p>
<p>During our little excursion, we remarked several large herds
of cattle, and numerous goats, but were unable to discover upon
what they subsisted; of course their owners must supply them with
food and water at night, though as these are scarce articles, it
is not improbable that great numbers of the unfortunate animals
perish.</p>
<p>Guinea fowl and quail aboimd in every part of the island, and
afford good shooting; if a person wishes to procure the former,
he must set off at daylight. There are also hawks, king-fishers,
and one or two other birds: of animals, I met with a few monkies,
but doubt much if any person who had once seen one of these
singular creatures asleep, would wantonly kill them; and
certainly a semi-cannibal alone would eat of one.</p>
<p>The island is, at particular seasons, extremely unhealthy,
and, taking into consideration the badness of the landing, the
great fatigue experienced in walking even a few miles in a place
so hot, and so entirely destitute of shade, and also how little
there is to compensate any person for the trouble, it is scarcely
worth the while of any one, save the sportsman, to go on shore:
at all events, I would advise no female to land unless the water
be more tranquil than it generally is.</p>
<p>I have said that we touched, on a former voyage, at Mayo. This
island is of no great extent, and its sterility is even more
apparent than that of St. Jago: the only signs of vegetation
which we were enabled to discover, being observed on the sides of
two mountains, of considerable elevation. We landed at some steps
cut out in the rock, and a worse landing place I have rarely
seen; for the sea beats with no little violence against the
precipitous sides of the cliff, so that it requires great care
and attention to prevent the boat from being stove or upset. The
town, as it is termed, is a collection of miserable huts,
inhabited by about 1500 Portuguese blacks; and not far from it
are the saltpans, where a large quantity of salt is annually
made, forming the sole produce of this delectable spot. During
the rains, the island is said to be covered with grass, but when
a drought occurs, the condition of the natives, as also of the
cattle and asses, must be dreadful. We procured water by digging
holes in the sand, and then placing casks, into which the water
was allowed to drain; a tedious process. That which we got,
however, although soft and vapid, was by no means bad. I would
recommend no one to touch at this most wretched island.</p>
<p>The only land made, after leaving St. Jago, until we reached
New Holland, was the Island of St. Paul, by all accounts a most
singular spot; but we were not near enough to make any
observations concerning it.</p>
<p>After a voyage of sixteen weeks, with no incidents or events
of any kind worth relating, we finally arrived at Swan River; and
it may be imagined how much our curiosity was excited to see,
with our own eyes, a spot of which such a variety of accounts had
been published.</p>
<p>This place was known to the French long before the English
thought of colonising it: they seem to have entertained no very
high opinion of its beauties or capabilities.* The coast, to some
distance on each side of the entrance to the river, has a most
wretched appearance, nothing being visible save barren rocks, or
a sandy beach, with a dreary looking country beyond; in short, a
more inhospitable spot is rarely to be found; and a vessel driven
upon the rocks, formed an object which did not conduce to animate
the scene.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Swan River was discovered in 1696 by Vlaming,
but he gives no account of it.]</p>
<p>The port, or road-stead, called Gage's Roads, is partially
sheltered by Garden Island, and two other islands named Rotten
Nest and Pulo Carnac, but it is greatly exposed to the north-west
winds, which often blow with considerable violence.</p>
<p>The best anchorage is in Cockburn Sound, formed by Garden
Island and the main, with the disadvantage, however, of being
nine miles from the landing-place at Freemantle; so that it will
always be highly inconvenient for the boats of the
merchant-vessels, besides causing a serious delay in discharging
the cargoes of the latter.</p>
<p>Gag[e]'s Roads are <i>said to be</i> perfectly safe from
October to April, as land and sea-breezes prevail regularly
during that season.</p>
<p>Freemantle, at the time of my arrival&mdash;(in October
1829)&mdash;was a mere encampment, every person being either in a
tent or temporary hut: its site is a level spot, consisting
entirely of sand, and the "bush" or forest, extends to within a
very, short distance of it. Water was easily procured by digging
holes a few feet in depth, but it was not particularly good; and
that which we took on board, at our departure, was not drinkable;
I understand, however, that a plentiful supply has been found
since, and of a good description. The only spring, near the
place, was about a mile distant, and it fell into the river only
a few yards from its source.</p>
<p>Some accounts state that Freemantle has been almost deserted,
the colonists having removed to Perth, or to their grants; others
that it is in a flourishing condition! Be this as it may, if the
site alone be considered, a worse spot for a town could hardly
have been selected! Situated as it is upon a bed of sand, and
exposed to a glare that is almost insupportable, it holds out but
little inducement for any person to fix his residence there,
unless compelled by circumstances.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Subsequent to writiug this I have been
informed, by one gentleman, that there were <i>five hundred</i>
houses at Freemantle: and, by another, that the number was very
small: yet both had recently been there!]</p>
<p>It was not a little curious to observe the incipient town
during the first few months after its commencement. Tents and
huts in every variety; goods of all descriptions scattered about
in disorder; the emigrants employed, some in cooking their
provisions, and others in sauntering about, or landing their
effects; many looking very miserable, and not a few equally
happy; different kinds of animals, just landed, and showing
evidently how much they must have suffered during so long a
voyage; such was the scene I witnessed on landing at the spot on
which the future principal sea-port of Western Australia was to
stand.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the Swan, which is close to Freemantle,
there is a bar on which the depth of water does not exceed six or
seven feet; and often, even when the wind is moderate, the
passage over it is not a little hazardous. From thence to Perth
the distance is about nine miles, and the navigation is impeded
by shoals, which, in some places, extend nearly across the
river.</p>
<p>On approaching the township, one part of the river forms a
lake several miles in extent, which would make a fine harbour if
a canal could be cut so as to admit large vessels. Its shores are
rocky, and generally useless to the agriculturist. Perth, the
intended capital, stands on a rising spot covered, when I was
there, with trees, in the midst of which the settlers had pitched
their tents, or erected their huts; and the situation is not only
well chosen, but affords some highly interesting views.* The
river, at this part, is about half a mile wide, or rather more,
but it is so shallow that it may sometimes be forded. The doctor
who came out with us, in attempting to ford it, stuck in a hole
and was drowned. He was short and stout, and was found, a day or
two after, standing upright, with his head only a few inches
below the surface; his companion got safe across.</p>
<p class="foot">[* There are now at least 120 houses there, if my
information is to be relied upon.]</p>
<p>The former unfortunate young man was a proof how little
dependence is sometimes to be placed in the advertisements in the
London papers, with respect to vessels bound to New Holland. The
agent advertised the L&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, conformably to
established custom, concluding with&mdash;"This vessel will carry
an experienced Surgeon." This "experienced Surgeon"&mdash;(the
doctor of the L.&mdash;&mdash;)&mdash;was a <i>shop-boy</i> in
the employment of a chemist and druggist; and he told me, without
hesitation, that so far from being acquainted with medical
matters, he did not know even how to bleed! He was one day about
to perform the operation of phlebotomy on one of the crew; and
commenced by fastening a bandage round the man's <i>wrist!</i> he
was, of course, told that he was doing wrong. He tried to bleed a
horse, and, after several attempts, failed entirely&mdash;the
horse died!</p>
<p>The agent also pledged me his word of honour (blessings on his
honesty!) that the fare should be good, and the allowance ample.
The first was, in every respect, most execrable, even the salt
junk and pork being unfit to be eaten; and the commander took
especial care that we should not gorge ourselves at the expense
of his larder, such as it was.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** It is very rarely the case now, that the
living is had: indeed, our fare on board the Royal George and
Brothers was not only excellent in its kind, but of a description
far superior to what I had expected to meet with on board any
merchant vessel: the wines especially would have done credit even
to those who pride themselves in keeping what is termed a good
cellar on shore. Most of the regular ships are equally well
provided.]</p>
<p>Many and very contrary opinions have been given concerning the
soil immediately around Perth; and the reader will easily
perceive to what an extent this was carried, when he is informed
that one gentleman said it was a rich loam, with a superstratum
of sand; and another asserted that there was nothing but sand to
the depth of several feet! Both of them were residing <i>upon the
spot</i>, not above thirty or forty yards asunder, and neither of
them would have <i>willfully</i> misrepresented the matter. As
there happened, opportunely, to be a saw-pit at hand, I examined
it with great care to the depth of nearly seven feet, and found
the latter assertion to be strictly correct. Consequently one of
the above gentlemen must have judged entirely from hearsay.</p>
<p>It does not however follow that the colonists will not be
enabled to cultivate the land, and make it in some way or other
available; for the soil about Sydney is of a considerably more
arid description, yet a variety of fruits and vegetables are
produced in abundance.</p>
<p>A mile or two above Perth there are several islands; and the
river, at this spot, was so shallow, that we were obliged to get
out of our boat and drag or lift it through the mud for some
distance; after which, we found ourselves again in deep water,
and it soon became fresh.</p>
<p>From this part of the river, to a distance, as well as we
could judge, of twenty-five or thirty miles above
Perth&mdash;that is to say, as far as we could proceed in a boat,
the scenery was frequently of a beautiful description, and the
banks, in many places, were composed of a rich alluvial soil,
covered with excellent grass. Unfortunately, the good soil was
rarely found to extend more than half a mile from the river, and
often not more than fifty or a hundred yards. The land, to a
greater distance, may be capable of cultivation, but we lost
sight of the black mould, and observed, beyond it, sand and
ironstone.</p>
<p>In some parts, the country was thickly clothed with forest; in
others it had the appearance of a fine park, in which scarcely a
tree was to be seen that one would think it necessary to
destroy.</p>
<p>It has been confidently asserted that the land is
<i>generally</i> so scantily wooded that there are not more than
<i>two trees to the acre!</i> Nothing can be more absurd; for it
is only here and there that such is the case, the country being
more commonly what is denominated "open forest," with spots where
the trees are very close together.</p>
<p>We made a point of landing wherever, we perceived an
indication of good land, and frequently discovered the holes
which had been dug by those who had preceded us, in order to
ascertain the nature of the soil, and saw at once the cause why
some persons had been so greatly deceived. Instead of proceeding
in a direct line <i>from</i> the river, they had, in consequence
of their ignorance of its course, passed partly across an elbow,
or bend, formed by it, without being aware that they were all the
time not far from its banks; so that they were led to believe the
black mould extended several miles <i>from</i> instead of
<i>along</i> it.</p>
<p>About forty miles from the sea, following the sinuosities of
the river, our farther progress was impeded by fallen trees; but
the French are said to have explored it to a distance of eighty
miles from the entrance. If this be true, they must have
disembarked at the place where we were stopped, and followed it
up on shore. We were prevented by want of time from going to the
source. The Canning falls into the Swan a little below Perth, on
the opposite side, and in most of its features resembles that
river; but it is smaller.</p>
<p>Our party ascended the stream as far as the fallen trees
permitted, which was not more, I think, than fifteen or sixteen
miles from its confluence with the Swan. Its banks are highly
picturesque&mdash;often romantic; and it struck me there was
rather a larger proportion of good soil than on the last named
river; but even on the Canning, it extends not farther than from
half to three quarters of a mile, and very seldom so far. I
cannot speak with any certainty as to the exact distance that we
went up the two rivers, for we could only surmise it by judging,
as well as we were able, at what rate we rowed; though I do not
conceive it could have been much farther than I have stated, as
we occupied only nine days in making the excursion, employed much
of our time in exploring, or shooting, and did not exert
ourselves very greatly in rowing. Between Perth and Freemantle
the land, in an agricultural point of view, is almost worthless,
if we except a few small spots; the greater portion of it
consisting of sands or sandstone covered with trees and
underwood.</p>
<p>The base of the Darling range approaches to within a few miles
of Perth: the declivities of these hills had not the appearance
of being particularly abrupt; and their elevation is considered
to be only about 1,200 feet, which I am inclined to believe is
somewhat underrated. Their aspect is triste and displeasing. How
far inland the range extends is not known; some officers had gone
up the Canning as far as they could in a boat, and then walked,
according to their statement, upwards of forty miles; when,
seeing no apparent termination to the range, and their provisions
being well nigh exhausted, they were obliged to retrace their
steps.</p>
<p>They said (and there is every reason to believe their
information to be correct) that the soil was bad or indifferent,
excepting sometimes at the bottom of a valley or ravine, nor did
they see much land adapted even for the purposes of grazing;
indeed their account of the interior was far from cheering.</p>
<p>On the Canning we fell in with twenty-one of the
<i>aborigines</i>, a greater number than had been previously seen
in a body. They were of good height, straight limbed, very
slightly made, and appeared to be extremely active. As though
they were not naturally sufficiently ugly, many of them had
thrust a feather, a bone, or a piece of wood through the septum
of the nose; and the same practice was observed on various parts
of the east coast by Cook's people, who gave to the ornament the
appellation of spritsail yard.</p>
<p>Of their women we were unable to get more than a transitory
glimpse, as the natives seemed to be either afraid or jealous of
us, and therefore kept them concealed, although not far off, a
sable head occasionally shewing itself amidst the bushes whenever
that inquisitiveness so natural to the sex was excited.
Nevertheless, these men were ever ready to make off with our own
women, as was afterwards proved more than once. They repeated all
we said, and imitated all our actions; and an amusing instance of
the former propensity occurred to a party while on their way up
the same river. At a spot where they had no expectation of
meeting with any person, they heard a cry of "Go it, ye cripples,
crutches are cheap!" On looking about them, they observed some of
the natives emerge from the forest, one of whom must have heard
an officer use the expression when exploring the country, and not
improbably fancied it was our mode of salutation. This addiction
to mimickry has been noticed by several navigators; and it is not
confined to the inhabitants of the west coast. They were
extremely afraid of a gun, and almost equally so of a dog: which
last, by the way, was rather singular, for they have dogs of
their own.</p>
<p>These people excavate large holes in the ground, but for what
purpose, does not seem to be precisely known. They are thought to
be intended for catching tortoises, but there is more reason to
suppose that kangaroos must have been meant; as they are so deep,
that, when I tumbled into one, by no means the most profound
among them, I was immersed above the shoulders. We found on both
rivers various kinds of water fowl and other birds; these were
rapidly decreasing, the constant warfare kept up against them on
the part of the colonists being so active, that scarcely one of
the feathered race could escape them.</p>
<p>Our lair at night, while on this expedition, was formed by an
oil-cloth, drawn partly over a bar supported by two trees, and
quite open in front; at the ends were placed some branches, and
before us was a large fire. Rushes, or grass, formed an excellent
bed; and a blanket, or cloak, was a good substitute for bedding.
Our fare consisted of "all the delicacies of the season" namely
black swans, ducks, widgeon, white, and black, cockatoos,
parrots, etc. Of kangaroos we met very few, and only two emus
were seen.</p>
<p>We found the musquitoes excessively annoying, though far more
so at Perth than elsewhere. At Freemantle there appeared to be
none; it was not far from the latter that I had pitched my tent,
just within the "Bush" and close to a huge rock, where I had the
advantage of a natural chimney and fire-place. Here I passed
three weeks in searching for the beauties and wonders of this
much extolled spot; though I cannot say with any great degree of
success.</p>
<p>Garden Island may be about twelve or fifteen miles in
circumference, and the highest part 150 feet above the sea. It is
little better than a mere bank of sand, and was so densely
covered with trees and underwood as to be in many places quite
impervious: nor from the nature of the soil does it present any
capabilities of improvement or of alteration for the better.</p>
<p>The water procured there was of such an indifferent quality,
that the officers of H.M.S. Sulphur were necessitated to send
over to Freemantle for a supply, such as it was: I have since
been informed that some of a better kind was afterwards procured
from wells.</p>
<p>The sheep and goats, which were left on the island some time
before, had perished, and the only animal found upon it at my
visit, was the Wallabee kangaroo, with an occasional seal. The
island appeared to be quite useless to the husbandman; but it may
possibly prove an eligible spot for the establishment of a
fishery, as snappers and other fish were abundant. Sharks also of
a large size, are seen both in Cockbourn Sound and Gag[e]'s
Roads; we had one of these monsters alongside the vessel, and its
length was certainly not less than twenty or twenty-two feet. I
am not positive whether the black whale has been seen near the
land: there were great numbers round the ship when we were within
sixty or eighty miles of it.</p>
<p>The animals at Swan River are of the same description with
those on the East Coast, and the only noxious beast is the native
dog, or wolf of this country.</p>
<p>From the colony being so nearly in the same parallel with
Sydney, it is taken for granted that the climate of both must
necessarily be alike. It does not, however, follow as a matter of
course; for local circumstances may cause an essential
difference; in proof of which, a variety of places might be
mentioned, and it is frequently exemplified in New South Wales. I
do not mean to say there <i>is</i> a difference, for some time
must elapse before the climate of Western Australia can be fully
known; but as Perth and Sydney are so widely asunder, and so
differently situated, it is probable there must be a
distinction.</p>
<p>While I was at Freemantle, the thermometer rose at noon to 87
deg., and once or twice to 91 deg.; before nine o'clock in the
evening it had frequently fallen to 56 deg., making a difference
of from 31 to 35 deg.; this was in a large tent. After my
departure, it was sometimes as high as 105 deg. in the shade, and
before midnight fell upwards of 40 degs.! What effect this rapid
change of temperature may have on the constitution, remains to be
proved; in so far as I was individually concerned, I found a cool
night, after an oppressive day, highly agreeable to the feelings,
and not in the least injurious to the health; but it must be
remembered that I was only five weeks at the place.</p>
<p>I have heard that opthalmic complaints were common, and have
abundant reason to believe they were greatly magnified.
Throughout the months of May, June, July and August, 1829, the
rains were incessant; and as, sometimes for several days
together, there was scarcely an hour's intermission, the sailors
were in the habit of saying that it had left off raining, and
taken to pouring. Afterwards, when I was at Sydney, there were
great complaints of drought at the Swan; from whence I infer,
that both the east and the west coasts are equally liable to
suffer from drought and floods. The situation of the settlement
with respect to its distance from various parts of the globe, is
unquestionably superior to that of Sydney or Hobart Town; and
provided it possessed a safe harbour, and a fair proportion of
good soil in the interior, without being too distant from the
coast, I should undoubtedly prefer a location there to either of
the other two colonies. That the representations of the fertility
of this portion of New Holland, which were published in the
different periodical works, were amplified, will admit of little
doubt; and hence the reason why so many persons experience a
feeling of disappointment on their arrival, as they had naturally
been led to expect a much finer country, with a sufficiency of
arable land in the vicinity of the capital.</p>
<p>It is easy to conceive, that when those who first explored the
rivers, observed the scenery on their banks, (for whatever may be
said to the contrary, the scenery <i>is</i> often beautiful,)
they may have been greatly struck by the general effect; and,
judging only from the immediate neighbourhood, have taken it for
granted, that the alluvial soil extended to a much greater
distance. This, to say the least of it, was injudicious, as the
examination of a spot intended for colonization, cannot be too
minute; and nothing could be more calculated to deceive, than the
publication of a highly coloured picture of its aspect.</p>
<p>When we are told of a country being singularly magnificent, we
are naturally inclined to believe it in every respect eligible
for a settlement, not taking into consideration that whatever may
be the nature of the scenery, the land may be of a very different
quality, or, from local circumstances, not adapted to the
purposes of tillage.</p>
<p>Admitting that some reproach attaches to those who, by their
description of Western Australia, misled the public, still one
cannot but blame persons who, finding on their arrival that the
reality did not equal their anticipations, became afterwards
discontented, and despaired of ever succeeding in their
speculations. Some of them had quitted England with the most
visionary notions imaginable, and, on the demolition of their
airy castles, which vanished within a few hours after they had
landed, they left the place in disgust, with heavy complaints of
deception, and then strove to assuage their choler by striving to
make it appear far worse than is actually the fact. One of them
seriously contemplated taking out a pack of fox-hounds; another
was resolved on having a cock-pit; and we may with justice
suppose these trifling projects were not the only Utopian schemes
that were concocted in the brains of the multitude of fanciful
dreamers, who thought the <i>terra Australis incognita</i> of our
forefathers, would prove the <i>El Dorado</i> of their posterity.
The last accounts (1831,) stated the population of Swan River at
3,000, or more, which is probably not overrated, the arrivals
having been very numerous.</p>
<p>It may with truth be asserted, that of no place on earth have
there been published such contradictory reports as of Swan River.
While I was in New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, (in 1830,)
information came from all quarters, that the whole of the
settlers were in a state of utter destitution, not having even
the most essential necessaries of life. At this very time, I
<i>read</i> a letter from one of them to his friend at Sydney, in
which occurred the following remark: "We have every thing in
abundance, save fish-sauce, for which we are but badly off; try
if you can persuade any one to send a supply, it would be sure to
meet a ready sale!"</p>
<p>Although one would think the emigrant must have enough to
occupy his mind, without going to the trouble of procuring such
ridiculous luxuries, this man's letter plainly proves the want of
veracity on the part of those who said the settlers were
suffering from starvation.</p>
<p>A gentleman who afterwards went on to Sydney, affirmed most
positively, that there was not a blade of grass throughout the
settlement, having absurdly founded his opinion on what he had
remarked between Perth and the sea; so that here we have one of
the numberless instances in which emigrants have touched at Swan
River, inspected a portion of country not nine miles in extent,
and then left the place, marvellously astonished at not having
perceived abundance of grass on the sea-coast itself. There are
settlers who have succeeded in their exertions, and are now
comfortably established; but it must be confessed, that rather a
large proportion of those who embarked the whole of their
property in the speculation, have suffered considerably; and such
will always be the case, when persons evince so little foresight
as to invest their entire substance in a scheme, of which the
success is extremely doubtful, and a failure attended with almost
utter ruin.</p>
<p>The interior has been explored, and, as I expected, tracts of
country affording fine pasturage, have been discovered. The soil,
also, on the banks of several streams to the southward, is
represented to be excellent; but it cannot be expected that I
should describe the country from mere hearsay. The only portion
of it that I had an opportunity of exploring, was that about the
Swan and Canning; and if I attempted to delineate the interior
from the accounts given to the public by those prejudiced against
it, or biased in its favour, I should only mislead the reader. It
is obvious, from the same cause, that it is out of my power to
give any advice on the subject of seeking for land; the emigrant
may rest assured that he will find none unoccupied within sixty
or eighty miles of Perth, and in all probability not within a
much greater distance. I have no doubt, however, that as the
country becomes more known, arable and pasture land will be found
when least expected, as was the case in New South Wales, when in
one instance, nearly sixty miles of mountains covered with dense
forest, were traversed before the open plains were seen, on which
the township of Bathurst has been established. Unfortunately a
long period must elapse before roads can be made in a colony
without compulsive labour; and when made, nothing save valuable
merchandize of small bulk would defray the expense of distant
land carriage.</p>
<p>I am not at all convinced, that it is a good plan to take out
apprentices; many of those that went having proved very
refractory and of little use. Their wages varied from 10<i>l</i>.
to 25<i>l</i>. or more per annum; while the mechanics, and others
who had gone there at their own expense, and were consequently
independent, earned from eight shillings to a pound daily. As
soon as the apprentices, whose term of servitude I believe was
for seven years, perceived this, they very naturally wished also
to be free, and in order to accomplish it, did all that lay in
their power to annoy their employers to the utmost so as finally
to oblige them to cancel their indentures. This is not so
difficult as might be expected, for the <i>quantity</i> of work
to be daily, performed is not specified; and although the law
authorizes the master to correct an apprentice, the latter may
easily manage to keep clear of the law, and at the same time go
through his labours in such a careless and negligent manner, that
the master often has cause to regret having had anything to do
with him.</p>
<p>It will perhaps be asked, what is to be done without them? I
can only reply to the question by repeating my previous
assertion, that those taken from England rarely turn out well,
and the greater portion of them extremely ill; for which reason I
would rather trust to hiring those who are at liberty to work,
where, and for whom they think proper.</p>
<p>It is precisely the same with servants who are taken to the
other colonies. Two cases occurred in the ship in which I last
went out; nor were their faults and inutility discovered until it
was too late to remedy the evil.</p>
<p>The preceding notes are extracted from my journal; and I have
in addition collected the latest intelligence in my power,
touching the progress of the colony, but it is not of a
satisfactory nature. Conflicting statements still exist, and to
such a degree as almost to render it impossible to give any
correct information relative to the present condition of the
place. Several of those who formerly spoke and wrote of it in the
highest terms of admiration, have, notwithstanding, gone on to
New South Wales or Van Dieman's Land. A writer observes, in a
recent publication, "As a proof that the accounts of the scarcity
are false, I neither heard nor dreamt of any want during my stay
there of two months; for I bought fresh butter at 4<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>. per pound; potatoes at 9<i>d</i>., and vegetables at
the same scale of price!" How this can be adduced as a proof of
the <i>abundance</i> of provisions, (such was the case in the
work alluded to), I am at a loss to discover.</p>
<p>I am greatly pleased to find, that not a few of the emigrants
who remained are perfectly contented and happy, and hope soon to
hear that the colony is in a far more thriving state than is
generally supposed. Other settlements have been formed along the
coast to the southward, but I know not with what success. It is a
prevalent opinion that the seat of government ought to have been
at King George's Sound, where there is a plentiful supply of
water, and good soil in the interior, with a safe harbour. Some
persons have said that it is not even now too late to select a
more eligible spot for the capital; but what would the colonists
at Perth say to a change that would so depreciate their property,
as to render it, comparatively speaking, of scarcely any
value.</p>
<p>Swan River is a proof amongst many, how cautious people in
England ought to be in believing all that is written respecting
Australia, and particularly where they observe that inclination
to hyperbole or exaggeration, which are so often found in the
productions of those who attempt to describe that vast island.
One writer says he has been in Switzerland, in South America, and
in other regions, without having seen any thing <i>equal</i> to
the tract of country between Swan River and King George's Sound;
and another makes the same remark in New South Wales.* I cannot
say I was able to discover the most distant resemblance, (if I
except the descent into Illawarra,) between any part of New
Holland that I have visited, and Switzerland or South. America.
The aspect of the country is totally different, so is the
vegetation; the mountains are mere mole-hills, compared with
those of the other two countries, and the absence of water in the
landscape would alone cause a material difference. Besides, how
is it possible to form a comparison between the beautiful valleys
of Switzerland, strewed as they are with cottages, vineyards,
fields and gardens, watered by noble rivers, or innumerable
streams that descend in cascades from the rocks, and diversified
by magnificent lakes, which reflect every object around them, and
the generally cheerless valleys of New Holland; or between the
sublime mountains of the former, the summits, often the craggy
and precipitous sides of which, are covered by eternal snow and
ice, and the uniformly monotonous hills (the most lofty known is
little more than a third of the height of Mont Blanc,) of the
latter.</p>
<p class="foot">[* A third remarks that the environs of New
Norfolk, in Van Dieman's, are also <i>superior</i> to any views
which he observed in Switzerland!!]</p>
<p>The great plains of New Holland most probably resemble the
Savannahs of America; and any farther comment on this part of the
comparison would be superfluous; nor should I have alluded to the
subject except to guard any one in England from placing too
implicit a confidence in the absurdities penned in Australia.</p>
<p>If activity, perseverance, and urbanity, on the part of a
governor conduce to promote the prosperity of a colony, that at
Swan River ought to succeed; but whether it will or not, time
alone can prove. Difficulties and obstacles occur at all newly
formed settlements; but these disappear, as was the case at
Sydney, provided the colonists do not remit their exertions; and
that such will not be the course pursued in Western Australia,
will, I feel confident, be proved by the result of their
labours.</p>
<p>The reader will bear in mind, that this brief sketch of Swan
River applies to the Settlement no later than 1831. Many changes
have taken place since that time, but I shall leave him to peruse
more recent accounts of the Colony; and if he should chance to
meet with an absolutely true, or entirely impartial statement of
all that concerns ft, he will be very fortunate. For my own part,
if determined upon emigrating, I would <i>personally</i> inspect
the country, however distant, in which I proposed to settle, and
not trust to <i>any</i> accounts, no matter by whom written.</p>

<p><span class="aa">The</span> voyage from Swan River to Sydney
occupied three weeks, but I shall suppose myself on my second
visit to the Australian colony; this was in August 1832. After
our departure from St. Jago, where we touched for water, etc.,
nothing meriting a detail occurred until we reached Bass's
Straits, between New Holland and Tasmania. We had sailed upwards
of 12000 miles without having seen land, which must have been
delightful to those who admire an endless expanse of sky and
water, but the uniformity of which was somewhat fatiguing to
those who delight in woods and green fields. Just as the night
"had rushed down black and sudden upon the face of the deep" we
accidently saw certain rocks, lying almost in the track of
vessels sailing through the Straits, on which a strong current
had nearly driven us. If this had happened, and the merest chance
alone prevented it, many of us, perhaps all, would assuredly have
met with a most disagreeable termination to our wanderings; for
shortly afterwards the winds arose, and the waves with them, so
that if we had struck upon the rocks, the total loss of the
vessel would have been inevitable.</p>
<p>It is rather extraordinary that upon the islands here, and
indeed upon all those on the coasts of the two countries, there
are kangaroos, but how they got there seems incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Having cleared the Straits, and their numerous rocks and
shoals, we entered the Pacific, notwithstanding its appellation,
"one of the most boisterous of oceans, and soon reached
Sydney.</p>
<p>Possibly it may interest some readers to know that taking the
distance in direct daily rans from Plymouth, we sailed more than
14,000 miles: but the total number of miles traversed on our
aqueous route could not have been less than 19,000, a distance
equal to nearly four fifths of the circumference of the
globe.</p>
<p>The duration of the voyage was about the same as from England
to the Swan, that is to say sixteen weeks.</p>
<p>On his arrival at Sydney, the emigrant, if married, should
take a lodging, for at the hotels his money will disappear with a
celerity somewhat marvellous; besides which, he must take into
consideration that his wanderings in search of land may be far
more protracted than he imagines; and in the meantime, there is
no reason why his family should not be made as comfortable as his
circumstances will admit of.</p>
<p>Above all things, let him be cautious what connections he
forms, and with whom he becomes acquainted; and he must also be
careful how he places too great dependence in what he may hear of
the various districts. I was informed, at Bathurst, that the "New
country"&mdash;(Argyle)&mdash;was actually not worth a visit! On
going there I had reason to prefer it, in some respects, to
Bathurst: another proof that fhe traveller had better trust to
his own observation than to that of others.</p>
<p>It has often occurred to me, that the emigrant would do well
to pass a couple of months in examining the different parts of
the colony, and of course, more particularly where unlocated land
is likely to be found, before he finally decides upon
establishing himself in any particular district. More than one
person, whose opinion I have asked, has entirely agreed with me;
and although I admit that some time might perhaps be saved by his
locating himself as loon as possible after his arrival, still I
cannot but think the advantages derived from being thoroughly
acquainted with the localities of the colony would fully
counterbalance any loss of time.</p>
<p>To a single man the extra expense would be scarcely worth
consideration&mdash;(it would be amply compensated by the
information he collected)&mdash;and, in fact, the whole cost
might not equal his expenses if residing at Sydney. A married man
could leave his family in lodgings, in any of the towns, at no
great distance from the capital; such as Paramatta, Windsor,
Richmond, Liverpool, or Campbelltown, in all which, excepting,
perhaps, the first, house-rent must be lower than at Sydney: he
might then absent himself for several weeks at a time, during
which period, instead of spending their money at some cheerless
inn, his family would be just as comfortable as if they had
remained in England. Any articles of furniture that may be
thought necessary, had better be purchased in London; if not
wanted afterwards, they are sure to sell at a price that will
fully repay the original cost and freight.</p>
<p>The only convenient way of travelling in the "bush," * is on
horseback. In this manner, therefore, the emigrant will proceed
into the interior, putting up at the different inns so long as he
journies on the high road, and when he quits it, at the houses of
the settlers,** who will always give him a cordial reception. If
there is no habitation at hand, a bark hut may be constructed in
a few minutes.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "Bush" is the term commonly used for, country
<i>per se</i>: "he resides in the Bush," implies that the person
does not reside in, or very near, a town. It also signifies a
forest; and is an expression so well understood, and so much
employed in the colonies, besides, being extremely convenient,
that I have often used it for want of a better.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** By "Settlers," I mean the farmers only: and
by "Colonists," the whole of the free inhabitants.]</p>
<p>In some parts of the colony it will be necessary to have a
pack-horse to carry provisions, and, in that case, a tent may
easily be taken&mdash;a tent-pole can always be procured at the
spot where the traveller bivouacks. The most convenient dress is
a shooting suit, and the following articles should be carried
when a person sets out on one of these excursions:&mdash;a gun,
some matches, a compass, tomahawk, blanket, and tether-rope for
his horse, with some bacon and flour, and any other necessaries
that may be deemed requisite; some tea, in a cannister, must not
be omitted; it is almost meat and drink to a person when on one
of these expeditions, as I know from experience, and far
preferable to spirits. I should also recommend the traveller to
take a brace of good kangaroo dogs, as they will frequently prove
of great use&mdash;indeed he will often be indebted to them for a
dinner. It is indispensable that the valise or saddle-bags be
made so as not to gall the horse, and that the saddle be always
well dried, beaten, and brushed; without these precautions the
animal will, in hot weather, be quite certain of having a sore
back.</p>
<p>Two or three persons setting off thus furnished, and having
with them a servant or a couple of natives, might enjoy
themselves greatly, if at all partial to travelling. Many objects
would excite their interest in a country totally different from
any other they may have previously visited.</p>
<p>I will now inform the emigrant, to the best of my power, where
he is likely to find unlocated land, leaving his own judgment to
decide him, whether one situation be better than another; in
fact, advice upon this head would be worse than useless, as it
would only tend to deceive; for when a tract of country is thrown
open to location, the most eligible portions of it are often
disposed of within twelve or eighteen months afterwards. If,
therefore, I were to recommend any one to inspect a spot where
there is at present vacant land, he might find, on his arrival in
New South Wales, that it had all been secured, and that he must
go still farther into the interior.</p>
<p>Nearly all the intermediate country from Sydney to Shoal
Haven, Lake George, Bathurst, Hunter's River, and to a distance
of ninety miles up the last, is long since occupied, or
unproductive. South of Shoal Haven&mdash;(sixty-five miles from
Sydney)&mdash;are Jervis Bay, Bateman's Bay, and other places,
where there is still land unoccupied; and when it is reflected
how much more valuable a farm near water-carriage is than when at
a remote distance inland, I am surprised there are not more
settlers on this line of coast, and the more so, as it is not
unlikely that the climate may be preferable to the northward of
the capital, and less liable to drought</p>
<p>There are stock-stations&mdash;(to which cattle and sheep are
sent)&mdash;nearly as far as Cape Howe, 240 miles from Port
Jackson.</p>
<p>In the vicinity of Lake George, to the south-west of Sydney,
there is land that is not taken; with the disadvantage, however,
of being upwards of 150 miles inland; so that the expense of
carriage, which is considerable, would annually absorb a large
sum; and nothing would remunerate the farmer except wool and
tobacco. By employing his own drays he could save very little,
and perhaps nothing.</p>
<p>Beyond the Lake is the river Morumbidgee, which, after flowing
some distance, falls into the Murray; and the last, after a
course, of several hundred miles, empties itself into a lake near
Encounter Bay. Much of what has been said concerning these two
rivers is extremely difficult to comprehend; for instance, they
are said to be <i>navigable one thousand miles</i>; but if this
be true, how is it that the boat in which a late expedition
descended them was twice stove, and frequently in great clanger
from sunken trees, rocks, and sandbanks, etc., etc.? If the
Murray be really the noble stream it has been represented to be,
it appears strange that a whale-boat was unable to proceed on it,
without encountering such perils that the skiff, which was towing
astern, was once actually sunk by coming in contact with a log!
And again, how are we to understand the account which represents
the Lake to be from <i>fifty to sixty</i> miles in length, and
<i>thirty or forty</i> miles in breadth, with a <i>medium depth
of only four feet?</i> Would not even a moderate gale convert the
whole of its waters into an expanse of breakers? It is asserted
that the Murray for 50 miles from its mouth is 350 yards broad
and from 20 to 25 feet deep.</p>
<p>Behind Cape Jervis there is a tract of country bounded on the
west by the Gulf of St. Vincent, and by Lake Alexandrina and the
sandy space which separates the latter from the sea on the east.
This tract is said, in the same account, to include a space 75
miles in length, and 55 miles wide, and to occupy a surface of
<i>seven millions of acres</i>, of which <i>five millions</i>
consist of rich soil, whereon no scrub is found; and is
accessible through a level country on the one side, and by water
on the other!! Now the above would comprise only 4,125 square
miles, or 2,640,000 acres! I presume, therefore, this must be a
mistake. The Lake is immediately to the eastward of Gulf St.
Vincent, extends to the shore of Encounter Bay, and has no
available communication with the sea.</p>
<p>There is much vacant land on the banks of the Morumbidgee, and
there are some few settlers, with stock-stations, at a distance
of nearly 300 miles from Sydney: the most remote of the former is
not above 200.</p>
<p>Bathurst is 120 miles to the westward of the capital; beyond
the township there is unappropriated land, but, I believe, not
nearer than thirty or forty miles.</p>
<p>A Government Establishment formerly existed at Wellington
Valley, 117 miles from Bathurst; and it was to this place that
all the principal convicts, or those called specials were sent:
that is to say those of good connections. It has been described
to me, by persons who have been there, as a very beautiful
country, with good soil, and no deficiency of water.</p>
<p>Here, in addition to the great distance from Sydney (237
miles), there is the objection, that to reach Bathurst itself the
traveller must cross the Blue Mountains, over which he has to
proceed nearly sixty miles; and although the route has of late
been greatly improved, some parts of it are still in a bad
condition.</p>
<p>The Hunter's River district, 130 miles, is entirely located,
but there is still land to be had on the banks of the Chichester,
Manning, Williams, and other streams, not far from it.</p>
<p>At Port Stephens, 100 miles by sea, and nearly double that
distance by the common route to the Hunter, there are not many
settlers, the Australian Company having taken a million of acres,
and consequently precluded any one else from making a selection
there. Of this part of the colony an author remarks as
follows:&mdash;"Here a <i>million</i> acres of good arable and
pasture land have, <i>with all imaginble ease</i>, been culled
out, superiorly watered, etc. Of this grant 300,000 acres were
inspected; only <i>one hundred</i> were calculated to be
absolutely useless; 500 more were <i>bad, but still
productive</i>; leaving 299,400 acres of either excellent, or at
least of very tolerable quality!" He says, also, that Port
Stephens is for merchant vessels <i>one of the finest harbours in
the world!</i></p>
<p>How he could possibly have been so misinformed, I cannot
conceive; nor could I have imagined any person who had been some
time in the colony, so credulous as to believe that such a large
tract of good land (1,562 <i>square miles</i>), could be found at
one spot, on any part of the coasts of New Holland.</p>
<p>The port is a bar harbour, so that small vessels alone can
enter it, those of a larger description being compelled to anchor
outside; and the country has a barren and unsightly appearance.
Without doubt the soil of some portions of this enormous grant
must be fit for every purpose, but its advantages have been
magnified to a degree not a little incredible.</p>
<p>I cannot say, positively, whether there is any available land
in the immediate neighbourhood of the Grant, but am quite
convinced, it would not be worth the time or trouble of a visit
to ascertain.</p>
<p>Port Macquarrie is the northernmost point at present (1833)
open to location. The vicinity may be considered a fine country,
but there are lofty mountains no great way off. Although no
alluvial plains have been discovered, excepting near the
settlement, there is much open forest land, with good feed for
cattle or sheep. Water is also plentiful and of excellent
quality; and nothing can exceed the luxuriance of the wheat and
maize cultivated there. The harbour has a bad bar at the
entrance, yet few accidents happen; as at high water, vessels
drawing from ten to twelve feet can enter with perfect safety.
The river, formed by the union of the Wilson and Hastings, is
navigable about thirty miles: the country is undulating with much
thick "bush" on the banks of the two streams.</p>
<p>This was formerly a penal settlement, but was thrown open
about three years since, and is rapidly becoming settled. There
is no doubt of its being well worth a visit, and the emigrant
could go there by land if he wished to see the intermediate
country: the distance is 278 miles. North of it there is no
beaten track; with a guide, however, there would be no difficulty
in following the coast.</p>
<p>There are still unlocated tracts of open country at Gammon
Plains, 150 miles from Sydney, and between them and Liverpool
Plains, fifty miles farther, but often hemmed in by mountains;
these are generally covered with grass to the summit. A farm at
this distance inland can only serve as a station for cattle or
sheep.</p>
<p>To recapitulate the several districts where unappropriated
land may be found, it may be remarked, that south of the Shoal
Haven River, beyond Lake George, and on the Morumbidgee and
Murray, between Bathurst and Wellington Valley, between Bathurst
and the Hunter, and to the northward of the latter as far as Port
Macquarrie, the emigrant will no doubt be enabled to find a grant
that would suit his purpose.</p>
<p>I say nothing concerning the indication of good or bad soil,
as I take it for granted, that every person, intending to become
a farmer, knows, at once, the difference between that which is
productive and that which is not. As to certain trees indicating
the quality of it, this is merely a general rule liable to many
exceptions. I have seen trees growing in very bad soil, when,
according to some who have written upon this subject, they are
found only where it is good: the apple is said by many to
indicate the best of land, and by others, that which is, in every
respect, the worst. So much for a contrariety of opinions upon a
point which might be decided with the greatest facility without
reference to trees of any kind.</p>
<p>The various descriptions of soil are not likely to bewilder
any person who possesses a moderate knowledge of agricultural
matters; and any one who does not, had much better remain in
England. Besides, there are very different opinions entertained
respecting sand loam; some preferring the former because it does
not part with its moisture so freely as the loam, a point of no
small consequence in such a dry climate.</p>
<p>Having thus touched on the subject of seeking for land, I
shall now describe the routes from Sydney to the interior and
distant settlements, adopting the terms most commonly used in the
colony; for if I were to designate the various counties, the
reader would not be in the least assisted. The route to Lake
George, more commonly denominated the "New Country," * is by what
is called the Great South Road, both sides of which, as far as
Liverpool, twenty miles, are too thickly covered with forest to
afford much interesting scenery; nor do I recollect a single view
particularly worthy of mention. This township, or village,
contains a good hospital, and some neat cottages and inns: the
population is trifling. Quitting this place, I passed the houses
of numerous respectable settlers, and came to Campbell Town,
twelve miles. Too much forest still meets the eye, but some of
the views are rather fine. This is a small place and badly
situated; it is likewise not always well supplied with water
unless it rains hard, at which time some of the inhabitants get
more than they require, as their houses are flooded.</p>
<p class="foot">[* So named, because comparatively speaking,
recently settled.]</p>
<p>In the vicinity of, and for some miles beyond, Campbell Town,
the country is very undulating and picturesque, and quite
superior to the environs of Sydney; the settlers too are
numerous, so that this tract has an animated and populous
appearance.</p>
<p>Seven miles hence are the Cow-Pastures, containing many
thousand acres of fine land, but a large proportion is the
property of one gentleman.</p>
<p>The route then leads principally through forest,** which is
often very dense, and across the Razorback, an acclivitous hill,
of no great elevation; after which the traveller enters Bargo
Brush, an uncouth forest, encompassed by wild and craggy hills,
and covering the worst of soils, through which he has to proceed
ten or twelve miles. I then crossed the Mittagong range, of
moderate height, entered a much more cheerful country, and came
to Bong-Bong, 80 miles from Sydney. Here are some good farms,
with a fair proportion of rich soil and well watered. The
township is on the Wingecarabbee, a small stream, and is a
capital of Campden, or rather was so, for another site has been
selected, five miles lower down, where a new township, called
Berima, is to stand.</p>
<p class="foot">[** "Open forest," is of that description where
there is no underwood, and the trees in general are far
asunder.<br>
<br>
"Scrub," is dense forest with much underwood and bad soil.<br>
<br>
"Vine brush," is almost impenetrable forest, where great numbers
of climbers, parasitical plants and underwood, are found: the
soil is generally good.<br>
<br>
"Brush," is forest with occasional underwood, but not so dense as
"scrub:" besides which, the latter may be without large trees:
"brush" is never destitute of such.]</p>
<p>The road then passes for some miles through Wombat Brush,
which is quite as unsightly as that of Bargo, and after crossing
the Uringalla, (20 miles from Bong-Bong,) more commonly called
Paddy's River, (because, I presume, more harmonious,) I soon
found myself in the open forest country of Argyle, and came to
Lockersleigh, an estate affording abundance of pasture and arable
land. In proceeding hence to Goulbourn Plains, 12 miles, I had
twice to ford the Wollondilli, which more usually forms a chain
of ponds than a river.</p>
<p>The plains are 120 miles from Sydney, and contain from 25,000
to 30,000 acres naturally clear of trees, with a large extent of
open forest around, particularly on the way to Lake George, 30
miles, farther inland.</p>
<p>What proportion of the ground here is fit for cultivation, it
would be difficult to say, but most of it is probably more
adapted for pasturage than tillage; indeed a finer grazing
district is seldom seen. There is excellent soil along the banks
of the Wollondilli, which intersects part of the plains, forms
here and there miniature lakes, and imparts an extremely pleasing
effect to the landscape, and some patches are likewise observed
at a distance from the river. The last may possibly form a stream
of some little consequence after much rain: its more usual
appearance is that of a series of ponds connected by small
rivulets often not more than a few inches in depth.</p>
<p>From the plains, or rather downs, are seen endless ranges of
mountains; still this may be considered, upon the whole, a very
noble tract of country, nor are the elevations themselves always
useless; as although for the most part, they are, throughout
their entire height, overspread with trees, there is commonly
found a luxuriant herbage beneath them. While on a visit here I
went to see the Cookburndoon, 12 miles from the plains; this is
also a chain of ponds. Some pretty spots are about it, but only
calculated for small farms, as they are closely confined by
hills.</p>
<p>Lake George is from 15 to 18 miles in length, and seven in its
greatest breadth. On the eastern shore there are extensive
plains, and open forest: the western has nothing very agreeable
in its aspect, being merely a range of low hills nearly level on
their summits, and looking more like a huge bank, with little, if
any, available land between them and the water. This Lake is
supposed to have been formerly a succession of inconsiderable
ponds, which is scarcely probable, as, if such had been the case,
the last "Great Drought" would have almost dried it up. It is not
unlikely that some years since its present level rose in
consequence of a flood, 15 or 16 feet, and killed all the trees
around it: after which, during a drought, it was reduced within
the original boundaries. The dead trees still remain, and where
the land is low, extend some way from the shores. The water is
brackish, yet the cattle prefer it to any other, and some of the
settlers do not dislike it.</p>
<p>No one seems to know what animals inhabit the Lake, though it
is pretended that a species of seal, or as it was called a devil,
had been seen in it; but as Satan is made to personify all
animals whatever, when of the non-descript or wonderful kind, it
is not improbable that the creature in question, may have been
altogether imaginary. Several settlers informed me that they had
seen nothing living it: there were, however, plenty of black
swans, ducks, teal and other wild fowl, upon its surface; and in
the water-holes, or creeks, that communicated with the Lake,
there are cray-fish and eels, together with some very small fish,
none of which appeared to quit the fresh water. Eels of large
size are sometimes caught in the water-holes; in one of the
latter, not twenty yards across, near Goulbourn Plains, one of
these animals was killed, that weighed twenty-two pounds. There
was no river within several miles, but eels are known to wander
much on the land.</p>
<p>It was here that I first met with the Native Companion, or
Gigantic Crane: there were 40 of these great birds (they are
<i>six feet</i> high) in one flock, and it was an amusing sight
to see them marching along in military order like a file of
soldiers: the effect, too, was fine when they rose at once into
the air.</p>
<p>Here also are numerous wild, or native turkies, the Bustard of
New Holland. When a person wishes to shoot this bird, he should
go on horseback; it will then often permit him to approach within
half a dozen yards: on foot he will seldom get more than a
distant shot, which is almost useless, as it will carry off an
incredible quantity of lead. Lake George is upwards of two
thousand feet above the sea; and in March, answering to our
September, the evenings were so cold, that we always found a fire
necessary after sunset.</p>
<p>In proceeding hence to Lake Bathurst by the shortest route, I
had to steer by compass, and crossed three ridges, from the most
lofty of which the prospect comprised an extensive range of
broken country, with a wild intermixture of mountains, rocks, and
occasional plains. Of gentle undulations, but few were to be
perceived, the elevations appearing steep and difficult of
access: and the vegetation formed one compact mass of foliage,
only broken here and there by some enormous tree that had
overtopped its fellows. The lake is not more than sixty miles
from the sea, and its circumference does not exceed twelve miles:
not far from it there is much naturally clear land, a portion of
which most probably forms a lagoon in wet weather.</p>
<p>The scenery here is of a bolder description than at Lake
George, and also more picturesque, but hills predominate as
usual, more than one would wish. Stock-stations extend nearly 100
miles beyond the Lake; and even the farms or grants, some way.
Such an immense portion of this vast tract abounds in grass, that
there is yet space for innumerable flocks and herds; nor can it
possibly be exhausted for some generations. At present the actual
population is very scanty even at Goulbourn Plains; and between
them and the Lakes still more so. The fact is, the proprietors do
not generally reside upon their farms, but leave them in charge
of overseers.</p>
<p>Bending my steps to the south-west, I passed through much
fertile, though almost uninhabited country, passed a day at
Lumley, a most capital form, and came to the Shoal Haven Gullies,
twenty-six miles from Lake Bathurst. These are ravines of great
depth (from 500 to 1,200 feet) and of tremendous appearance;* and
through one of them flows the Shoal Haven river. Any one who
loses his way in them, will stand a fair chance of ending his
days there; for even if he came upon the river itself, there are
places where it rushes between vertical rocks, so that it would
be quite impracticable to pass there, and equally so to ascend
their precipitous sides!</p>
<p class="foot">[* Oxley saw in the interior, a chasm, or ravine,
from two to three miles wide at the top, and from 100 to 200
<i>feet</i> wide at the bottom. The depth was 3000 feet.]</p>
<p>An unfortunate man was lost in them a short time previous to
my arrival, and information had just been given by some natives,
of their having discovered his remains.</p>
<p>It is a curious circumstance, that so few persons are lost in
the intricate ravines and immense forests of New South Wales; and
the more so, when it is considered that the greater number of
those who miss their way become so confused as hardly to know
what they are about! Upon these occasions I suspect accident
alone enables them to extricate themselves, unless they meet with
the good fortune of the German Emperor; which is, however, not
very likely, as I never heard of angels, or chamois hunters, in
the wilds of this country.** Some persons have wandered about
during several days; and one gentleman informed me, that he and
his companions were once three days without food, and were just
on the point of killing one of their horses, when they luckily
came upon a Stock-station! One unhappy man was found on the
<i>thirtieth</i> day after he was missing, and, from the state of
the body, it was supposed that he had not been dead more than two
days.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Maximilian of Austria once so completely lost
himself in the mountains that he knew not which way to take: the
chronicles of the time state, that an angel (most probably a
chamois-hunter) extricated him from his disagreeable
situation.]</p>
<p>Several of the convicts have perished when trying to escape;
but there is no doubt that much of what has been said of their
setting off in search of Timor, Ireland, and China, is purely
fabulous, whatever may be affirmed to the contrary.</p>
<p>There are edible roots in the colony, though not easy to find;
the only one I ever ate was given me by a native at Swan River,
and it was not unlike a parsnip. The fern root, however, is eaten
by the Aborigines at Moreton Bay, and also by the New Zealanders;
and it is considered highly nutritious.</p>
<p>Many people seem to possess an intuitive faculty of finding
their way; and I have known persons who will ride twenty or
thirty miles through the "bush," and though unable to see more
than a quarter of a mile in any direction, will yet exactly hit
the place to which they were proceeding. Admitting this to be the
result of a general knowledge of the country, it is not the less
surprising; for by keeping a mile too much to the right or left,
the traveller may pass the house where he intends to stop, and
have to ride a long distance before he comes to another!</p>
<p>Close to the gullies there are caves which are extremely
curious, and well worth inspection, but they have not yet been
explored. In walking along a level spot one comes unexpectedly to
a hollow, seldom more than thirty or forty feet across, often not
near so much, and of very trifling depth. At the side of this, or
occasionally at the bottom, is observed a hole, into which it is
sometimes difficult for more than one person to enter at a time;
this aperture is the entrance to extensive fissures, ramifying in
all directions through the limestone formation. I descended into
the largest, forming at once a lofty cavern, though the "hopper,"
as it is called, was only a few yards in diameter: the entrance
was in the side of the last. The cave contains nothing
particularly remarkable except the mouth of another, which must
be of great depth. Into this we threw large stones, and judged
that the first fall was fifty or sixty feet; and from five to
seven seconds were counted before a stone ceased to rebound, the
last fall denoting plainly that it had met the water. It is
supposed this cave cannot be less than twelve hundred feet deep,
but these calculations are always liable to error. Each time a
stone was thrown in, a great number of bats were disturbed; these
might, without much trouble, be dislodged by any person
venturesome enough to descend the cave, to do which ropes and
torches would be required.</p>
<p>Near this there are "fairy rings" which, unlike those seen
elsewhere, are entirely denuded of vegetation, being as bare as
if they had been burnt.</p>
<p>There is some admirable land in this part of Argyle, fit
either for pasturage or grain, and why the settlers are not more
numerous I do not comprehend; but from Bong-Bong to the Lakes,
and thence to Inverary, nearly 120 miles, there are very few
persons located on their grants, which are used more as
stock-stations than farms. I am not aware that there is much that
is worthy of observation between Inverary and Bong-Bong,
forty-one miles; the features of the country are much the same
with what one finds on every road in the colony.</p>
<p>From the latter township to the brow of the Merrigong Range I
had again to pass through Bargo Brush, but in a different
direction; the distance is about seventeen miles, through dense
forest, or over swampy flats of a most dismal aspect, in some of
which my horse sank up to the girths! In consequence of the trees
not having been properly marked, I had the extreme satisfaction
of losing my way, and passing a night on a flat rock, not twenty
yards round, and surrounded by bogs and streams, with the further
consolation of having nothing to eat during thirty
hours&mdash;that is to say, from the dawn of one day to noon of
the following!</p>
<p>The night was lovely, and the moon was at the full, while a
cloudless sky, studded with innumerable stars, added to the
effect; but in these dreary solitudes there reigns so deep a
silence, that even the hoarse croaking of a frog would have been
a relief; nor did I perceive the slightest symptoms of animated
existence, save an occasional owl or bat that flittered past in
quest of its prey. I might possibly have admired the solemnity of
the scene at any other time, but must confess, that after riding
and walking nearly ten hours (for, short as was the distance, it
employed me all that time in finding my way to the rock on which
I bivouacked), I began to think with the philosophers, that
Nature really <i>does</i> abhor a vacuum. Moreover, being of
opinion that a rigid fast, or abstemious diet, are alike
detrimental to the traveller, I would willingly have exchanged my
lair for a comfortable room, and my meditations for a supper.
When a hungry man thinks of eating he only increases his
appetite; I therefore made a large fire of banksia, converted my
saddle into a pillow, and was soon sound asleep upon the
rock.</p>
<p>To such trifles as these one soon becomes habituated when
travelling in the "Bush;" and in a climate like that of New South
Wales, I doubt if the danger from exposure is of any
consequence.</p>
<p>Arrived, after a tedious search, at the commencement of the
precipitous pass by which I was to descend, I enjoyed a most
superb prospect of the district of Illawarra, with a vast extent
of ocean.</p>
<p>No one who has not wandered over such a region as New South
Wales, can folly appreciate the effect on the mind when, after
having passed through vast forests, and among eternal mountains
or hills, the traveller emerges from such triste scenery, and
comes at once to a spot whence the view appears absolutely
boundless; and the effect is greatly heightened by the suddenness
of the transition, which probably causes a person to fancy the
prospect even more magnificent than it really is.</p>
<p>The pass winds beneath lofty crags, some of which project so
much as to have a very threatening appearance; and the path is so
steep and slippery, as well as stony, that no loaded animal could
descend it without imminent danger, as it is not only extremely
narrow and abrupt, but the ravines are of such depth, that a fall
would be attended with inevitable destruction. The distance to
the township, called Wollongong, was about eighteen miles, that
is, from the summit of the pass near which I had spent the
night.</p>
<p>The district has very properly been called after the native
name; it had previously been termed the "Five Islands," from as
many islets on the coast. It contains 150,000 acres, and is
completely hemmed in by the Merrigong range and the sea. Its
aspect is that of a tropical region, especially near the range,
and it is incomparably superior in point of scenery to any part
of the Colony I have visited. The palms, from fifty to eighty
feet high, and quite straight, the fern trees, parasitical
plants, and climbers, were beautiful, and in many places so
luxuriant was the vegetation, and so completely were the
climbers, many of them nearly as large as a man's body,
interwoven amongst the trees, that they rendered the forest off
the path, utterly impervious. Wollongong is sixty miles from
Sydney by the nearest route, and is situated close to the coast.
Even in this interesting district there are not many respectable
residents, nor has much land been cleared; so that some time will
elapse before its various resources are called forth. Along the
shore the good soil extends, in some places, to within a few feet
of high-water mark, even where the land is low: and, at the
northern extremity of the district, quite to the edge of the
cliffs. The last contained large seams or veins of coal,
fragments of which were strewed about the beach.</p>
<p>The observation made by some writers respecting the trees here
being for the most part cedar, is an error; and what they have
said of the boat harbours is also wrong. The fact is, the shore
is entirely exposed and open, affording no shelter whatever; and
when I was there, a small vessel of not more than six or eight
tons, was driven by a gale high and dry upon the sand. With a
safe port, Illawarra would soon become of consequence, and
perhaps the intended road will make it so: it appears to be well
watered, and the coast abounds in fish. The land is so heavily
timbered, and the trees are frequently of such enormous
dimensions, that the expense of clearing it would be very great;
but once in a state of cultivation, I have no doubt such rich
soil would make an ample return.</p>
<p>It is here that the nettle tree (<i>urtica gigas</i>) is
produced; if handled, it inflicts a pain far more severe than
that caused by the common nettle, and grows to the height of
thirty or forty feet.</p>
<p>I had intended proceeding farther south, but a lake had forced
its way through the sandy barrier which divided it from the sea,
so as effectually to put a stop to my farther progress along the
coast, unless I had waited a few days, which want of time
prevented me from doing; and if I had gone by a circuitous route,
I should still have had to swim my horse across several streams
that had overflowed their banks, which would have been attended
with some danger and great inconvenience. It is a common opinion
that the bell bird denotes the proximity of water; if this be
true, Illawarra must have enough of that necessary article, for I
heard more of these birds than in all the rest of the
Colony&mdash;the woods literally swarmed with them. The note is
not unlike the single tinkle of a sheep bell, at least I know of
nothing else to compare it with; it is melancholy as well as
monotonous.</p>
<p>The Shoal Haven River, so named because it falls into the
haven, takes its rise in a swamp at Corrumburoo, 190 miles from
Sydney; and although in many places a mere mountain stream, it
contains fish of the weight of fifty or sixty pounds, and there
are people who say they have seen them of <i>ninety pounds!</i>
Certainly the fish in some of the streams are of a size that
would astonish any one in Europe.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Oxley caught, in the Lachlan, a fish that
measured 3 feet 5 inches in length and weighed 70 pounds.]</p>
<p>There are settlers or stations from the source to the haven
(the last is thirty-five miles from Wollongong); and there is
also on it a church grant of 42,467 acres.</p>
<p>The accounts of the tract of country through which the river
flows are highly favourable; the grounds that enclose the ravines
are level, and afford pasturage, as well as arable land, which is
likewise the case in several of the ravines themselves, (the
number, however, that are accessible is but small), the kangaroo
ground being one of the most remarkable; and at a place called by
the natives Cambewarra, there is a space of twenty square miles
of the very best land.</p>
<p>Between the upper part of the river and a branch of the
Morumbidgee (on which are the plains of Molonglo, Limestone, and
Yarralumla, where there are numerous stations) the mountains are
represented to be of great height, and the summit of one to the
south-west of Lake George is usually covered with snow.</p>
<p>The present southern boundary of the Colony is at Muroya,
twenty miles from Bateman's Bay, and 190 from Sydney.</p>
<p>The appearance of the coast south of Illawarra, as far as Cape
Howe, when viewed from the sea, is mountainous; but in general,
the mountains appear to be at a sufficient distance from the
shore to admit of locations along its whole line, and the
moderately elevated or undulating ground, sometimes stretches a
long way back, As far as I could judge from the vessel in running
along the shore there did not seem to be any land naturally free
of timber; in short, all the plains at present known are in the
interior. Of course I was unable to form any opinion as to the
nature of the soil.</p>
<p>I quitted Illawarra by a pass not quite so precipitous as that
by which I had descended, but nevertheless sufficient to try the
vigour of man and horse, as it was no easy affair to scramble
over the fallen trees, and up the rugged spots which continually
impeded our progress; and after riding many miles through a tract
of country apparently condemned by nature to perpetual
loneliness, and desolation, I came to Appin, 30 miles from
Wollongong. Here there are numerous settlers, and much land is
cleared and cultivated.</p>
<p>The distance hence to Sydney, through Campbelltown and
Liverpool, is forty-five miles. On my way I saw a specimen of the
damage that may be caused by floods, and found that all the
bridges had been destroyed, so that people were under the
necessity of passing by temporary ones, swimming their horses
across, with the assistance of men stationed on the banks of the
streams, for that purpose. "The great drought" had lasted so long
that some persons began to think no more rain would fall in the
colony: they were mistaken, for the flood-gates of the heavens
were opened, and there descended such a deluge that the rivers
overflowed, and swept away barns, stacks, and fences, besides
drowning several people and many cattle.</p>
<p>It will be perceived in the slight sketch of this excursion of
400 miles, that, instead of describing minutely every mile of
ground, I have only attempted to convey to the reader some idea
of the general aspect of the country through which I travelled;
and this mode I shall adopt throughout, for it would be useless
to occupy his time with the constant repetition of&mdash;here I
passed through forest, and there over a small spot of clear or
cleared land, and so on.</p>
<p>Between Sydney and Liverpool the proportion of cultivated and
cleared land is not near so considerable as might have been
expected from the proximity to the capital; besides which, the
bad soil predominates greatly. It is not until we reach Goulbourn
Plains that naturally clear land of any extent is seen, nor is
the country at all populous excepting from Liverpool to the
Cow-pastures; beyond the latter, the settlers bring only land
enough into cultivation to supply their own wants.</p>
<p>The route to Bathurst is by Paramatta, a small town, sixteen
miles from the capital; it is the head-quarters of one of the
regiments, and near it is the country-house of the governor. The
place contains, about 3,000 inhabitants, which includes the
troops, and different families in the neighbourhood; as also the
factory, a mile distant, to which the refractory female convicts
are consigned, in order to go through the tonsorial operation,
hard work, bread and water diet, etc., and a rare unruly race
they are.</p>
<p>The town stands in a hollow, in consequence of which, together
with the circumstance of the sea-breeze being scarcely felt so
far from Port Jackson, the heat is even more intense than at
Sydney, and the thermometer, more than once last
summer&mdash;(1832-33)&mdash;rose to 98 deg. in the shade. The
houses are small, and though some of them are rather neat, I
cannot say they appeared, to my eyes, to "<i>shine like
transparent alabaster</i>," neither did they excite in me any
"<i>thrills of admiration</i>. Therefore, other travellers must
have been more easily excited, or more fortunate than myself.</p>
<p>Some of the most fertile soil in the colony is on this route,
but chiefly at Prospect, an eminence not far from Paramatta;
there are also many farms, and a fair proportion of cultivated
land&mdash;(principally off the road)&mdash;as far as the Nepean,
nineteen miles; there is however far too much wood.</p>
<p>The Nepean is fordable in a dry season, but the ford is very
bad; on crossing (there is a punt) the road passes over Emu
plains, of inconsiderable extent; and the traveller then ascends
the Blue Mountains by an acclivity far too laborious and
fatiguing for a high road; but another and better route was in
progress, which will be a great improvement.</p>
<p>Among these mountains I rode nearly 60 miles, passing the
entire distance through forest, with an occasional inn by the
road side. They are extremely rugged and wild and most of them
very difficult of ascent. They consist of masses of hills
irregularly connected, diverging into ranges of various heights
without any appearance of uniformity, and invariably shrouded by
sullen evergreens, which afford but little shade; while the
ravines, which divide them are very narrow, and often form dark
and gloomy chasms. Their aspect, indeed, is peculiarly dreary,
exhibiting little save continued precipices, with a sterile soil;
nor do they display either beauty or magnificences added to
which, that <i>horror umbrarum</i> so solemn and, to most persons
so replete with disagreeable reflections, has an effect not very
exhilerating to the lonely traveller.</p>
<p>Previous to reaching Collet's Inn, 75 miles from Sydney, one
part of the route is 3000 feet above the sea; there is then a
rapid descent into the vale of Clywd, in which the house is
situated. It is only at the Inns that grass is found near the
route, and even there it was but scanty, Water is also scarce in
a dry season, and when discovered, the bullocks are sometimes so
eager to get at it, that they are apt to rush (dray and
all)&mdash;into the waterhole: of this I saw an instance on my
way.</p>
<p>From one point on the route, there is a prospect extending
over nearly forty miles of country, affording a fair specimen of
the scenery of New South Wales, with its mountain-ridges which
reach to the horizon in all directions; and its forests, just
broken here and there by a farm.</p>
<p>The common drag would never answer on this road, particularly
in descending Mount York, where the inclination is so rapid, that
the carriers are in the habit of attaching to the drays a large
log or billet of wood, as for example the trunk of a tree, which
being drawn after the vehicle, prevents it from descending too
quickly: at the foot of the hill the log is thrust to the side of
the road, and the latter, in consequence, is only passable for
one vehicle at a time.</p>
<p>In Van Dieman's Land a carpenter and wheelwright has
established himself at the base of a precipitous hill, where the
same drag is employed, and of the wood thus, brought down, he
makes use, as he finds convenient.</p>
<p>Five miles from the vale there is a military station on Cox's
River, and a government reserve of 200 acres, not far from whence
are sundry grants used as stock stations, but these are not near
the route. Twenty-one miles farther on is a bad ford, over the
Fish River, otherwise called the Macquarrie, which flows into the
interior. Cox's River being the last that takes its course to the
coast, to the northward of Sydney. Both banks are located all the
way to Bathurst.</p>
<p>During the whole of this journey of 120 miles, there is, after
leaving Emu Plains, very little to interest the mete traveller.
The Vale of Clywd is rather romantic, and there are some few
savage looking ravines that are well enough; but the wildest spot
is near the weather-boarded hut, an inn twenty-three miles from,
the Nepean. Here a small stream falls over a precipice of several
hundred feet into a glen, the sides of which form a rocky and
abrupt rampart which precludes all ingress or egress. The water
is lost in the obscurity of a thick wood; nor does it appear to
be known by what channel it afterwards escapes. From the cascade
there is a striking view, between two vertical rocks about 200
yards asunder, which extends over, and far beyond the glen.</p>
<p>The greatest elevation of the Blue Mountains is stated to be
4000 feet above the sea: after passing them, the land though
still hilly, is thinly timbered and fertile. Bathurst is well
situated, and there is little doubt of its becoming in process of
time a considerable place; for as the country inland becomes
settled, stores or shops, will be established at the township,
and mechanics of every denomination will fix themselves there. I
heard a gentleman say, that as soon as steam navigation becomes
more in use, the interior settlements will be entirely deserted
by residents, and only employed for stock. I might with equal
propriety assert, that when steam <i>carriages</i> become common,
Bathurst, and other inland places, will increase their population
very rapidly! At all events, it is not likely that such a tract
will ever be deserted by the settlers, especially when it would
be scarcely possible (I feel certain it would not), to find such
another nearer the sea-coast.</p>
<p>The Macquarrie, after joining the Campbell, flows past the
township, but some of the neighbouring farms are badly supplied
with water, except after rain; the proprietors are therefore
obliged to send to the river for a supply, a great inconvenience,
as it is some way from them.</p>
<p>The plains or downs, (they undulate considerably) are twelve
miles in length, about five in width, and contain 30,000 or
35,000 acres destitute of timber and surrounded by open forest.
They are not unlike the Brighton hills. One circumstance
respecting them is remarkable, viz. on the <i>summits</i> of some
of the elevations or knolls, there are found dangerous quagmires
or bogs; and they are also seen in the miniature valleys. These
have not unfrequently a resemblance to a pond that has been
dried, but others are concealed by verdure; into one of the
former I went in to my girths, and nearly lost my horse.</p>
<p>"Fairy Rings" are common on the Downs, and on most of them
grow fungi of large size; seldom however, within less than
several feet of each other; mushrooms are common in all the moist
parts.</p>
<p>These plains are 2000 feet above the ocean, and are surrounded
by a fine open country: and as the settlers are numerous and all
highly respectable, the society is pleasant, and the families
that constitute it extremely sociable; so that this may be
considered the only spot beyond the mountains, where a person can
be said to have a neighbourhood immediately around him. The
township itself does not contain more than a dozen houses.</p>
<p>On the whole, I was greatly pleased with the place, and the
only objection I should have to reside there, is on account of
its distance from a market; but when the improvements of the
route are completed, there will be even in this respect a
material difference.</p>
<p>It is here that the best cheese is made; at least such is the
prevailing opinion; though why the settlers in the other
districts cannot make cheese of an equally good description I am
at a loss to discover, as the pasture in some of them is equally
good, and in several better. Wellington Valley inland of Bathurst
has already been noticed.</p>
<p>On the banks of the Macquarrie, and Lachlen, the former of
which loses itself in extensive swamps in the interior, there are
Stock-stations to a distance of three hundred and fifty miles
from Sydney; many of these are grants, but they are used as
stations. The Lachlan falls into the Murrambidgee; and the land
about it (such is also the case over all the country watered by
this river, and Wellington Valley as well) is covered with open
forest, with abundant pasturage of the best description. From
Bathurst I ought to have crossed the country to Argyle, but in
consequence of the information I received of its not being worth
a visit, I returned to Sydney by the usual route.</p>
<p>To proceed to the Hunter the traveller must again pass through
Paramatta; after which he has to ride eighteen miles through
forest, with cleared spots that are few in number and far
between; they had notwithstanding a pretty effect, which was
increased by the contrast they formed with the "Bush;" and they
took off in some little degree from the monotony which reigns
over much of the landscape. Some of the views too over Windsor,
and taking in the Blue Mountains, Emu plains, &amp;c. were fine.
The settlers are all small farmers, and there are not many of
them.</p>
<p>Three miles farther on we no longer observed signs either of
cultivation or good soil: and then had to ride fourteen miles
over rocky ridges and through "Scrub," which being a style not in
the least in accordance with the ideas of my companion, or
myself, touching the pleasing or picturesque, we were very glad
to find ourselves at the little inn on the right bank of the
Hawkesbury.</p>
<p>The road on approaching the river is unfinished and in a very
ruinous condition: at one spot, the side of it, built up with
large stones, had entirely given away, so as to leave a path only
wide enough to admit of one vehicle, and of rather a dangerous
kind.</p>
<p>The river is 250 yards in width, and 13 fathoms in depth: and
the distance from the sea is perhaps 40 miles in a direct line.
The inn stands on a romantic and interesting spot, but there is
far too little space between the Hawkesbury (and its branches)
and the mountains to admit of much cultivation.</p>
<p>We crossed over in a punt and immediately commenced the ascent
of the Blue Mountains by a carriage road extremely creditable to
the person who planned it. This pass is not many miles from that
which commences the route to Bathurst. Here we enjoyed some good
views of the farms on the Hawkesbury, which improve the landscape
greatly. The road would have been completed, but on account of
the facility of proceeding from the Hunter to Sydney by
steam-vessels, which has reduced the intercourse by this route to
almost nothing, the Government have wisely transferred the people
who were employed upon it, to places where their services are
more required. It forms a singular contrast with the only
miserable road that has been made in Van Dieman's Land!</p>
<p>The scenery is mountainous to the Wollombi Brook, thirty-five
miles, and there is not an habitation of any kind. Although among
these mountains there are some really fine views, much of the
scenery is indescribably sombre. The eye seeks in vain for
something more cheerful to look upon than a succession of ridges,
stretching as far as the vision can reach, and deep gullies
without a single spot uncovered by trees, and not a blade of
grass in any direction! Yet there is a multitude of flowers which
contribute in some degree, to adorn these solitudes; and they
prove in a measure, the truth of the remark, that the poorer the
soil the more it abounds in flowers. This is not the case every
where in the colony, and appears to me to be very uncertain; the
principal floral ornament of the Blue Mountains was the Warrataw,
one of the most magnificent of flowers; from one to three grow
upon the same plant, and the latter is from eight to ten feet
high. The gigantic and rock lillies also are uncommonly
beautiful, the first growing to the height of six or seven feet,
and bearing a crimson flower: the last is white and flourishes
only on a bare rock. Large stones or rocks, entirely without
soil, were nearly concealed by this ornamental plant.</p>
<p>One objection to the scenery is the almost total absence of
living creatures, with the exception of one or two small birds at
the few spots were water is found: the only specimen we saw was
one of those singular animals the Ant-eater (Echidna) which we
captured.</p>
<p>On descending the mountains we arrived at the Wollombi Creek,
found cultivated ground, a far more cheerful country, and a
comfortable inn. Resuming our ride, we passed through some very
romantic open forest country, sometimes along the steep bank of
the creek, seldom far from it, and in several places had to lead
our horses, the nature of the track which was on the side of a
rapid slope, not admitting of riding.</p>
<p>The shortest route to the lower part of the Hunter bears to
the right of the above inn, and that was the one I took on my
first visit to the river: the distance is not above twenty or
twenty-five miles. From the inn I passed over a level tract
interspersed with farms belonging to small settlers, but more
commonly there is nothing but a dense scrub, and came upon the
Hunter at an estate twelve miles from Maitland. On my present
excursion I went altogether a different way.</p>
<p>Some miles from the inn we fell in with several of the
aborigines, and the farther we rode the more we saw, until at
length there were not less than sixty with us, while our own
party consisted of our two selves, the overseer and seven convict
servants! <i>En passant</i>, I may as well do the last the
justice to say, that I never saw men conduct themselves better;
they were on foot, had to lead some young horses, and yet went
thirty-five miles in one day without a murmur.</p>
<p>It was entertaining to observe the different groupes wandering
among the trees, for we were all more or less scattered, and the
shouts of the wild denizens of the woods added to the effect.
Nothing respecting these people surprised me more than their
avidity for tobacco, they willingly sold me some of their arms
for two or three pieces not worth more than as many pence.</p>
<p>Their manners are scarcely formed yet, if I may judge from the
behaviour of one of them: he was trying to teach me the mode of
throwing the spear; when observing me to be somewhat clumsy, he
took it out of my hand, remarking at the same time, "Oh you
d&mdash;d stupid!" This was not polite in the barbarian, but so
long as the natives learn their English from the convicts, I fear
we shall get no better language from them. I am not at all
convinced that this black intended to make use of an improper
expression.</p>
<p>These people consisted of two tribes, one from Illarong, the
other belonging to the Wollombi, and were on their way to wage
war with another tribe. Some of them were diligently employed in
painting their sable bodies in a most fantastic manner, with a
substance that resembled pipe clay; and may have adopted this
Pictish plan, in order by thus disfiguring themselves to strike
the greater terror into their enemies. Although it certainly
added to their already naturally hideous aspect, the paint
imparted to it far more of the ludicrous, than either the martial
or terrible. They were but indifferently armed.</p>
<p>After a delightful ride of thirty miles from the inn, we
reached the Wollombi river, where I remained several days. In
consequence of the hilly nature of the country through which we
had ridden, the farms were mostly small, nor was there much
cultivated land; but on approaching Mr. B's. (called by the
natives Kineland) the valley of the Wollombi began to expand, and
at the farm is full two miles wide. It is closed in by rocky
ridges in every direction, and the river, a trifling stream which
falls into the Hunter after a short course, is half a mile from
the house. All this portion of country, with the exception of
occasional cultivated spots, is covered with wood, and such has
been the case from Paramatta, about one hundred miles: but it is
not thickly timbered after leaving the Blue Mountains.</p>
<p>The variety of birds in the valley is not great; I found three
kinds of quail, and a bird called the Indian Bee-eater (Merops);
it is nearly twice the size of the common swallow, flies very
much in the same manner, and the plumage is extremely handsome,
with two feathers projecting an inch or more from the tail: its
nest is made in a bank, into which it burrows much farther than
the sand martin (Hirundo Riparia) and it feeds entirely upon
horse-flies (Libellula.) It was here too that I first heard the
Cuckoo as it is called, a bird of considerable size, and not
unlike a hawk; its note is harsh and discordant, though still
bearing some resemblance to that of our harbinger of the spring;
it is only heard at night. There is also a species of large
curlew, whose singularly shrill cry, conjointly with the
lugubrious note of the cuckoo, has an effect which is
inexpressibly melancholy.</p>
<p>While here I went out after kangaroos, and to my surprise saw
only sixteen, at a place where formerly a hundred might have been
seen together; but within the last two or three years they have
almost disappeared. The hunting ground was far superior to any I
saw in Van Dieman's Land, being not near so rocky, nor so densely
timbered.</p>
<p>The whole of the valley of the Wollombi is granted away; some
of the farms are of great extent, and only one or two of the
owners reside upon their property; of society therefore there is
none.</p>
<p>As Mr. B. and I were now to travel through a region where
there are only stock-stations, we took with us sumpter-horses, a
canteen, tent, etc., and proceeded from Kineland to Jerry's
Plains, fourteen miles; these form a valley eight miles long, and
not more than a mile in breadth; we were now upon the Hunter,
about 100 miles from its mouth.</p>
<p>On leaving the plains, (they were named after a convict
Irishman), we forded the river, which was not higher than the
horses' girths, though it has been known to rise here thirty or
forty feet within three or four days. We then rode through a
succession of hills and valleys to Merton, thirty miles from
Kineland; most of the land (it is all open forest), is very
fertile, the soil being rich, and with no want of grass; but it
is used chiefly as a sheep-walk. All this tract is too much
confined by elevations, particularly about the Goulbourn, a
stream that joins the Hunter, near Merton. This estate is eighty
miles from water carriage, and is well supplied with water: the
garden is the best in the district.</p>
<p>From Merton we crossed the Hunter, and rode several miles over
alluvial flats, subject to inundation; our way then led us
through an indifferent country to the Wybong or Waibong, a small
stream that takes its rise in the Liverpool range, and falls into
the Goulburn.</p>
<p>Leaving this, we found the land thinly wooded, and the soil
sandy; nevertheless grass was plentiful, nor has there been any
deficiency of it for the last 70 miles.</p>
<p>The next little stream to which we came was called the Bingan
creek; this we followed up seven or eight miles, then crossing
two low ridges, we reached the Wobungi Creek, which passes
through Mr. B.'s sheep station, and five miles beyond this, we
were on Gammon Plains: having ridden thirty-five miles, or rather
less, through an exceedingly varied and interesting scenery, in
all respects equal to aught at Bathurst or in Argyle, and in some
greatly superior. The mountains are sometimes so thrown together,
that the valleys are of very narrow dimensions, but we rode every
mile of the way over a rich sward.</p>
<p>The contrast between New South Wales in 1829, and at the
present time, is not a little striking: for during the "great
drought," 1826, 27, 28, 29, not a blade of grass was visible,
except in shady spots, and now it abounds every where.</p>
<p>Gammon Plains greatly resemble those of Goulbourn, but the
soil at the former is generally better; even on the hills it is
often good. Many hundreds of acres have not a single tree upon
them, and thousands more are so thinly sprinkled with timber,
that there is not the slightest occasion for the axe. The various
parts of the plains are named by the natives; one of these is
called Gullingal, a second Booroobulbarrowindi; a third
Miangarindi, etc.</p>
<p>In this part of the colony I remarked a very peculiar
appearance in the surface of the ground. I allude to places where
the land rises in ridges exactly as though it had once been in a
state of cultivation; that is to say; like a field in which wheat
for instance had been once cultivated, and then permitted, after
the removal of the crop, to remain untouched; so that the water
or drain furrows may still be perceived. The ridges were often
several hundred yards in length, more commonly parallel than
otherwise, from ten to fifteen feet asunder, and frequently
terminated abruptly. The <i>summits</i> of the ridges, which were
seldom elevated more than six or eight inches above the
intervening furrows, were perfectly bare; in other respects the
ground was covered with a luxuriant herbage.</p>
<p>This "ploughed land," as it has been termed, was observed only
where the soil was a rich black mould, and rarely where the
surface had not a slight inclination or dip; but admitting that
the furrows have been produced by the agency of water, it is
still difficult to account for the great regularity with which
they run, and for their abrupt termination. I have never remarked
this peculiarity to be so very evident in any of the other
districts. Some persons refer the cause to the deluge, a theory,
like others of the same description, very absurd and very
unlikely to be correct.</p>
<p>The plains are watered by a small stream, which is much like
the Wollondilli, and the pasturage is of the first description.
The buttercup abounds, but I am not positive if it is indigenous,
though I am inclined to believe it is so, notwithstanding that I
have never yet met with a person who had seen it at any place
where cattle had not been depastured.</p>
<p>In the creek * we shot ducks, teal, widgeon, and a few snipe,
amongst which may be included the painted snipe, larger, and far
handsomer than the common one; the native turkey and ox-bird are
likewise seen here. One of the ducks was rather different from
the others, being of a brown colour, with the eyes black and
surrounded by a broad white circle. We shot also some platypi,
and a small bird like a mule canary (a species of saxicola); this
last is exceedingly rare in the colony, and I am not aware that
any other person possesses a specimen; there were only three
together, and the natives said they had never seen any
before.</p>
<p class="foot">[* A creek is commonly the bed of a stream,
which, being partially exhausted during dry weather, forms only
an occasional pond or water-hole.]</p>
<p>We had pitched our tent close by the hut on Mr. B.'s grant of
10,000 acres, whence we rode through a remarkably fine open
country, to the foot of a mountain named Boorooan, eighteen
miles, without having seen any bad soil, and encamped for the
night by the side of a small brook at the head of a narrow
valley, having around us a complete amphitheatre of hills.</p>
<p>At dawn of the following day, we sent on the servants with the
pack-horses, by the usual route, with directions to await our
arrival, and in the mean time ascended the above mountain, called
also Oxley's Peak.** The ascent is very easy, and admitted of our
riding to within a short distance of the summit; we then
dismounted, tethered our horses, and went the remainder of the
way on foot. The Peak is said to be 6,000 feet above the level of
the great plains, but this most probably means above the level of
the sea; it cannot certainly be more than 4,000 feet above the
former. From the hazy state of the atmosphere, the view was not
so extensive as it might have been, nor was it improved by the
total absence of water. Clusters of irregular eminences were seen
in all directions, shrouded to the summits with evergreen trees,
which formed a strong contrast with the grassy plains observed
amongst the elevations; but a prospect of far-stretched hills and
funereal forests, although interspersed with immense tracts of
meadow land, inspires one with feelings of melancholy and
sadness, rather than of satisfaction. Nevertheless there is a
sort of savage grandeur in the aspect of some parts of New South
Wales, which excites interest in the traveller, who cannot but
admit that the scenery of these stern wastes possesses a
character of peculiarity he has never witnessed elsewhere.</p>
<p class="foot">[** And if I mistake not, Mount Wereid as
well.]</p>
<p>This is part of a range branching off from that which divides
the eastern from the western waters: and from it, mountains
seventy miles off may be distinctly perceived on a clear day.</p>
<p>I have stated that flowers grow well in the sandy soil of the
Blue Mountains. On Mount Boorooan, on the contrary, with the
exception of the buttercup, there was hardly one to be found; and
this was the case on the Liverpool range generally. Descending
the mountain, on which we saw kangaroos, and the indications of
cattle having been there, we rode over good soil until we came,
not more than eight miles from its base, to the Great Plains, of
which so much has been said or written, and so little is known.
We may now be supposed to have quitted the colony, properly so
called, as no actual <i>locations</i> are permitted on this side
of the Liverpool, or dividing range.</p>
<p>In speaking of Liverpool Plains, the aborigines call them
Corborn Comleroy, Corborn implying great, as Gammon does small. I
was unable to discover if they applied the term to the whole of
this tract of the country, or only to some particular
portion.</p>
<p>After travelling over ten miles of a flat, without a tree or a
shrub upon it, we encamped near a hut, on Mr. B.'s cattle
station. Yarramunbar is the appellation applied to that part of
the plains over which we had crossed, and Gircobill is the name
of the station itself.</p>
<p>We had previously passed sundry mountains, with some unmeaning
English name applied to them; such were Nânni,
Mòorgòinbòin&mdash;(a basaltic mountain)&mdash;and others; the
English terms I do not recollect. The head of the small river
which traverses the plains, or rather a part of them, is called
Mochi, and the following are the names of various stock stations:
Woondee, Warra, Breza, Wallawârree, Guingulli, Eûrunbun, Waldoo,
all which, with those given to a portion of Gammon Plains,
(except perhaps that of Booroqbalbarrowindi, which may possibly
be over-long to be easily got through on one of our short days in
England), appear to me far more euphonous than the terms applied
by those who wish to <i>immortalise</i> themselves or their
friends.</p>
<p>The distance from Gammon Plains to Gircobill, is twenty-two
miles. Little seems to be known of the actual extent of the
Corborn Comleroy; that they occupy an immense space, is, of
course, evident enough; but if one is to believe all that the
natives, stock-keepers, and others assert, they must be some
hundred miles across. A respectable settler informed me that he
once rode, <i>in a straight line</i>, during nearly a
<i>month</i>, and then returned hopeless of succeeding in
reaching their utmost verge! And one of the natives said, that to
the place where he was born, it would occupy a person a whole
month to travel on horseback, and that there is not wood enough
there to make even a waddie or club. Fifty miles beyond
Gircobill, if one may judge from the concurrent testimony of
those who have been there, they must be far more extensive and
clear of eminences than at that station.</p>
<p>The ground was similar to a beautiful English meadow, the
grass being about two feet high, and the butter-cups were in some
places so numerous&mdash;(they are double the size of those in
England)&mdash;that the only colour visible was a bright yellow.
Some parts of the plains had the resemblance of burnished gold;
but where the grass was burnt or dried by the sun, the glare was
excessively disagreeable to the eyes.</p>
<p>I had received quite a false impression of these regions,
having been led to suppose, from various accounts, that they
constituted one boundless flat, unbroken by hills, denuded of
trees, and completely covered with such high grass, as to be
almost impassable. This is clearly a wrong description of them;
they may rather be likened to a lake, interspersed with islands,
clothed with wood; or in other words, they form one vast plain,
on which are insulated woody spots, the elevation of which is
from several hundred feet down to almost nothing; for they are
not always raised above the plain itself, at least the height is
so very trifling as not to be worth mentioning; only one or two
of them were without trees. One eminence was opposite our tent,
three miles from it, and was a curious and prominent feature in
the landscape; for while the mountains or hills at hand were of
whinstone, here was an elevation composed entirely of sand and
sandstone&mdash;(neither of which is found within a space of
several miles)&mdash;from 500 to perhaps 700 or 800 feet high;
six or seven miles long, and overspread with thick "bush." The
tree of greatest consequence is the pine, which resembles the
common fir, and grows always in a bad soil.</p>
<p>The plains, not unfrequently over a considerable space, are so
burrowed by the rats, that they are like a rabbit-warren, and
riding is in consequence not only unsafe, but, if the speed be
great, even perilous. Snakes, I had been told, swarmed in all
directions, so as to make it highly dangerous to walk in the long
grass. How far this may be true I cannot say&mdash;I saw none,
and Mr. B. only one, on which he nearly placed his foot; but in
ascending the Liverpool Range we killed a large black snake,
though why I hardly know, unless it be from the natural antipathy
that mankind bear to these creatures. The unhappy reptiles
rarely, most probably never, inflict an injury wilfully, and of
the multitudes I have seen in all parts where I have been, I
never knew a single instance of one attempting to bite, unless
when trod upon or attacked&mdash;it is natural they should then
do so in self-defence. Some of the settlers, and many of the
convicts have adopted a strange fancy, that a person or animal
bitten by a snake, is quite certain to die about sunset; and
others say that the bite of a black or brown snake will assuredly
prove mortal; that the last is not always the case may very
easily be proved, as I have myself known several instances to the
contrary. In one of these, the comrade of the man who was bitten,
killed the snake, and rubbed some of the fat upon the wound,
after which he procured the aid of a medical gentleman who
entirely cured the patient. A dog was bitten by a black snake;
its jaw became greatly swollen for a time, but the animal
eventually recovered. It is curious that this idea of dying at
sunset should be so prevalent; for in Japan, and many other
countries, it is also a common belief.</p>
<p>Close to the hut at Gircobill, there is a creek or series of
ponds, some of which extend from 100 to 150 yards or more, in
length, and are connected only in wet weather. At a distance of
some miles there is a river; an inconsiderable stream, that loses
itself in a swamp; of its source I am ignorant. On both the creek
and river there were such multitudes of wild fowl that we shot as
many as we could devour; at the same time taking care not to
destroy them unnecessarily. We met with one spoonbill, the third
that I have seen in the colony&mdash;it is a very uncommon
bird.</p>
<p>All this portion of the plains is liable to inundations; and
at these times large lakes are formed, which often cover,
according to the stock-keepers, a surface of many miles. When
this occurs, great numbers of rats are drowned, and the snakes
are obliged to retreat to higher grounds.</p>
<p>Behind Gircobill there is a whinstone-hill, from 500 to
perhaps 700 feet high, ten or twelve miles in length, and several
in width; from its summit we could see, even to the horizon,
immense plains of the greatest verdure, without a tree upon them.
One of these, (though the whole extent was not visible, the
greater portion was, and its length has been pretty correctly
ascertained), was at least <i>twenty-five miles</i> in length,
and from five to ten broad; and this flat alone must contain not
less than 100,000 acres! All the plains are bounded by mountains
of some height (one is decidedly higher than Borooan), except to
the north-west, in which direction only an occasional elevation
was observed, but no continuous range. It would be in vain for me
to attempt to convey an idea of the effect of a view over these
vast solitudes: I have never seen aught like them; and can only
compare them to the boundless savannahs or pampas of America;*
and, at the same time, I must confess that I cannot perceive how
any other comparaison can be drawn between the two countries. The
extreme silence that prevails here almost exceeds what the
imagination can conceive. It is true that a herd of cattle, some
emus, or perhaps a solitary bustard, can sometimes be
distinguished, but they are generally afar off; and the traveller
may frequently ride many miles without seeing a living creature!
One would imagine that a residence in such a lone place would be
liable to cause a change of some consequence in the minds and
habits of any person; and it would be an interesting point to
ascertain the effect on the convict stock-keepers, who, for weeks
together, can have no opportunity of conversing with a white man,
except their sole companion; for there are always two in a hut.
The time cannot hang very heavily on their hands, as they are
almost constantly engaged in riding after cattle, in order to
drive them within certain boundaries; or in hunting the kangaroo,
of which there are great numbers on the hills, and the emu.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Great Plain, or Pampas, east of the
Cordilleras, is about 900 miles in extent.]</p>
<p>From Gircobill we rode 20 miles, or more, in rather a
circuitous direction, to the other side of this part of the
plains, and pitched our tent at a station called Booranbill;
there was a stream close by, which, after a short course, like
the river, is lost in a swamp.</p>
<p>Our ride had led us over some miles of boggy ground, on which
we were obliged to lead our horses, as they sunk in at every step
they took; in other respects we passed over land covered with
grass, and quite firm. The grass was high and coarse; but, where
recently burnt and grown again, it was delightfully green and
refreshing to the eye; too much of it was, however, withered by
the heat.</p>
<p>We visited in out way a remarkable spring which issued from a
spot a little <i>higher</i> than the surrounding ground, and on
which there grew nothing but rushes and long grass. The natives
say, and some of the stock-keepers believe, that the devil or an
ally of his resides in it; and as we were determined to ascertain
if his Satanic majesty had really established himself in such
uncomfortable quarters, we sent in a posse of dogs, in the hope
that they would easily discover the occupant of this little
swamp, which was not above twenty yards in diameter. They had no
sooner entered, than we heard a peculiar noise, which we agreed
was made by some bird; but as none was seen, and as the dogs
would not proceed with the adventure, the mystery still remains
unravelled, affording an opportunity for any future traveller to
display his prowess: he must, however, wear mud pattens, and
invoke the assistance of St. Dunstan!</p>
<p>A few miles before we arrived at our resting place, we came to
an accumulation of loose stones 20 feet in height, and 40 or 50
across: some of them were of large size, others very small, and
all of them were sand-stone; and not far from this we found a
most singular mass of basaltic columns. The elevation did not
exceed 40 feet, nor the width at the base above 70 or 80 yards;
and the summit was about 12 yards in diameter. None of the
columnar fragments were more than 3 feet in length, nor were any
under 6, or above 12 inches thick; and they all had either three,
five, or six sides; at least we were unable to find any other
form, although we searched with great care. We did not observe
that any of them were upright or even nearly so; the heap
appearing to have been thrown up in such a manner, that all the
fragments were lying about in the greatest confusion. The soil
for miles around both the sandstone and basalt consisted of rich
black mould.</p>
<p>Near this we saw thirty-five emus, widely scattered, however,
on a plain which we had to cross, but from the nature of the
ground were prevented from getting very near them; yet we saw a
good run, as two of the greyhounds pursued a pair of these birds.
The emu, some distance in the rear of the other, exerted itself
entirely by fits and starts, running with incredible speed,
though much faster at one time than at another. One of the dogs
at length came up with it, and got kicked head over heels for his
pains, which will teach him in future to jump at the neck instead
of trying to lay hold of the leg; he may consider himself
fortunate in having received no injury, as not long before our
present expedition, a greyhound belonging to my fellow-traveller,
had his ribs broken by an emu, and died almost immediately. The
bird always springs off the ground when about to <i>lash out</i>,
and a kick from it is nearly equivalent to one from a horse.
Stately as it is, the ostrich far surpasses it in grandeur of
gait: indeed the latter, when running at its utmost speed, is
truly a magnificent object, at least I thought so when in
Africa.</p>
<p>A storm on these plains has an awful effect; one was
experienced during our stay at Gircobill, and the wind was heard
approaching amongst the trees on the hill behind, with the noise
like the rushing of a torrent, and long before it reached us.
This furious gust was exactly similar to a tornado, and, like it,
was accompanied by vivid lightning and tremendous peals of
thunder, rendered doubly loud by the reverberations from the
hill. The rain and wind had well nigh upset our tent, and
compelled us to take shelter in the hut.</p>
<p>Want of time prevented our remaining more than a few days in
the plains, and had this not been the case, we could have made no
discoveries without proceeding a long way into the interior.
Several persons have tried to cross them, and were obliged to
return after suffering from want of water and other causes. Mr.
Oxley in returning, found the land flooded, and had to ride
someway up to the girths; and another gentleman, who found a
copious supply of water on his way inland, was greatly
straightened for that necessary article on his way hack. The
Surveyor-General, went a great way on them, but two of his men,
who had been left for some reason at a place in the rear, having
been murdered by the aborigines, he retraced his steps.</p>
<p>It would possibly be worth the while of Government to
ascertain if the camel could not be introduced into the colony,
even if only for the purposes of discovery. This "ship of the
desert," such is the strong and expressive appellation that
denotes its value as a beast of burden, will travel great
distances without water, and with a load of five or six
hundred-weight: he will likewise swim across rivers, for the
celebrated Burchardt passed several at the tails of his camels,
on which occasions each animal had an inflated skin attached to
his neck; but as the conformation of this quadruped is so
peculiar, it remains to be proved to what extent he would be
enabled to ascend, or descend the rugged precipices that must be
passed by the traveller on a journey of discovery. From Sydney to
the "Corborn Comleroy," however, there is not a place that
presents the most distant impediment to the progress of a camel,
and it is only on the plains that it would be of use.</p>
<p>"In travelling through the desert," says Volney, "camels are
chiefly employed, because they consume little, and carry a great
load. The ordinary burthen is from 600lbs. to 750lbs., and they
eat whatever is given them, straw, thistles, the stones of dates,
beans, barley, etc. In the journey from Cairo to Suez, which is
40 or 46 hours, they neither eat nor drink; but these long fasts,
if often repeated, wear them out. Their usual rate of travelling
is very slow, being hardly above two miles an hour, for they will
not quicken their pace; but if allowed a short rest, they will
travel from 15 to 18 hours a day."</p>
<p>The point is, how would they succeed in passing over swampy
ground?</p>
<p>From Booranbill, our servants and pack-horses returned to the
Wollombi by the usual route, while we took that over the
Liverpool range to the Hunter. The ascent commenced four or five
miles from the Stock-station, and was, at times, abrupt and
fatiguing; but we were amply compensated for our trouble by some
magnificent prospects, particularly in the direction of the
plains: and the alpine is so blended with the champaign style of
scenery, that the views are totally different from those amidst
the Blue Mountains, though with the same absence of water.
Although the effect of the first view, when upon the Plains was
striking; and although one cannot help acknowledging the richness
and verdure of the land, its beauty soon begins to pall; the eye
becomes fatigued with so extensive a view, bounded only by the
level horizon, and the fancy can but imagine a continuance of a
similar series of flats. The prospect from the Liverpool range
was very different, as the grand characteristics of mountain
scenery afforded a relief which would be sought in vain on the
plains themselves.</p>
<p>With respect to the tract of country through which we
travelled from the Wollombi to the summit of the range (in a
circuitous direction,) say 140 miles, it may, without
exaggeration, be considered as unsurpassed by any part of the
colony, whether it be looked upon in the light of a pastoral or
agricultural country. The mountain that we crossed is 200 miles
from Sydney, but this pass is only practicable for horses and
cattle, the route for drays being more to the northward.</p>
<p>Six or seven miles from the foot of the range, we lost the
whinstone, and came upon a sandstone country, and met,
afterwards, alternations of good and bad soil, until we reached
Invermeen, nearly 30 miles from Booranbill.</p>
<p>The country at this farm, and to some distance in every
direction, is interesting. There is much forest land, though
sufficiently open to admit of good sheep-walks. We passed the
night there, greatly to our satisfaction, after having been so
many days under a tent. Near Invermeen is Segenhoe, an estate of
24,000 acres, on which the level land runs in narrow strips,
enclosed by hills and forests;&mdash;that is to say, just such an
estate as is usually found in the colony. I believe it is
considered a good farm. Twelve miles farther is St. Hiliers, one
of the finest estates on the Hunter; the house is the best in the
district; and as the proprieter is constantly engaged in planting
the most useful and ornamental trees (one of the very few
instances I have seen in the "bush"), the place bids fair to
remind him, at no very distant period, of an English country
house with its shrubberies.</p>
<p>Much has been said of the park-like scenery of the Hunter; I
really cannot speak quite so favourably of it. After riding no
great distance from St. Hiliers, that fine description of
landscape, so much of which we had traversed from the time we
left the Wollombi, entirely disappeared; much of the soil was
indifferent, or worthless, the grass scanty, the forest
unsightly, and the latter part of the ride, nearly twenty miles,
uninteresting; nor could I perceive any improvement in the
general features of the scenery all the way to Maitland,
thirty-six miles farther. There is undoubtedly fine land on both
sides of the river; but instead of speaking in such laudatory
terms respecting the mere aspect of the country watered by it,
writers and travellers would do much better to state simply, that
most, perhaps all, of the grants on its banks form excellent
farms, leaving the scenery out of the question, for it will bear
no comparison whatever with that which we had seen previous to
our coming upon it. Even in regard to the quality of the land it
is far inferior, as within a given distance there is much less
good soil than we had found during the preceding part of our
journey. Go where you will on this stream, the distance will be
short, excepting in a few instances, before ironstone and sand,
with the usual concomitants of ugly gum trees, are met with;
however, the settlers have more than sufficient good land to
supply their wants, and there is no scarcity of grass, though not
equal to that on Gammon Plains. I have heard this termed the
finest agricultural district in the colony; yet in 1829, many of
the crops had failed, and likewise during the three preceding
seasons, so as not to produce seed for the following year; at the
same time, the wheat at Bathurst was tolerably abundant, but full
of smut; while in Argyle it was perfectly clean, and the soil in
some cases yielded thirty-six bushels to the acre. I should
consider it a fine sheep country, and maize and tobacco thrive
uncommonly; indeed grain also grows extremely well, though in dry
seasons it is liable to fail. Frost sometimes injures the maize,
and such is also the case in Argyle.</p>
<p>The Hunter rises rapidly after heavy rain, and in some places,
even to the height of fifty feet; but I am not aware that the
floods have been attended with any destruction of property; and
from the nature of the country on both sides of the river, there
does not appear any danger of this happening, unless where
persons have placed their houses, etc. in such situations that
they must necessarily incur some hazard.</p>
<p>There are fords as low as Maitland; and even when the weather
has not been remarkably dry, the river may be crossed in several
places almost dry-shod. Its direct course is 125 miles, and it is
navigable 20 miles, or double that, following its sinuosities.
From the Liverpool range to Newcastle, nearly 120 miles, the
entire country is clothed with wood; but it may generally be
termed open forest as far as Maitland. The last is now the
principal township on the Hunter, and is rapidly increasing in
size; the situation however is particularly ill chosen; not that
the government are to blame, for the township properly so called,
where the court house and jail are, is some way from the other,
and out of the reach of floods; but on account of the facility
with which boats can be loaded or unloaded, the proprietors of
the ground have erected their houses on the bank of the river,
and also of a creek that falls into it. The consequence will most
probably be, that the first extraordinary rise that takes place
will demolish some of the houses, and drown the inmates. The
water has already more than once flowed into the street.</p>
<p>There are some alluvial flats in the vicinity, but not so much
good soil as I had been led to expect, from the high-flown
accounts given me of this part of the Hunter. One gentleman told
me, when I first visited the colony, that I might as well have
quitted Rome without having seen St. Peter's, as leave this
district, or New South Wales, (I forget which), without beholding
Maitland. Now that I have beheld the last, I must confess I feel
somewhat disappointed: Perth, at Swan River, in point of
situation, is far superior.</p>
<p>Thus it is: ask any person for a true and impartial account of
the colony, or of one of its districts, and the probability is,
the account will be unsatisfactory in all its bearings; for what
one traveller considers a beautiful country, is by another deemed
quite the contrary, and <i>vice versa</i>; and this goes far to
prove how cautious the emigrant should be how he places too great
confidence in the descriptions or accounts of New South Wales,
and Van Dieman's Land, and particularly of Swan River. I have
attempted to give a correct description of the colonies but am
just as likely to err as any other writer.</p>
<p>Close to the township there is a lake or lagoon, several miles
in circuit; it was dried up during the "great drought," but was
soon filled again. It has frequently occurred in this colony that
large ponds, of some depth when first discovered, (as the streams
are styled by courtesy rivers, so these ponds are termed
<i>lakes</i>)&mdash;and of an extent equal to that near the
township, have suddenly disappeared; one gentleman called his
farm after his own cognomen, with the addition of a word denoting
the presence of apiece of water, the two together forming the
name of one of our finest lakes in Cumberland. The <i>mere</i>
name remains, the <i>mere</i> water is gone.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the creek, behind the town, there is
one of the thickest vine brushes in New South Wales, so that it
is difficult to penetrate even a few yards, amidst such an
exuberant vegetation. Here I saw a most enormous tree of the
Ficus tribe, but what the proper name is I am not botanist enough
to determine; it is known by the title of the great fig; it no
more resembles a fig than it does an oak. The form of the trunk
is triangular, the side facing the south-east being eighteen feet
in width; that to the north nineteen feet and half; and that to
the west, twenty-two feet and a half; total, <i>sixty</i> feet.
This measurement is rather under than above the truth.</p>
<p>The trunk does not rise more than about thirty feet before it
separates into branches of such magnitude as to equal trees of
considerable size. Will it be credited that the former owner of
the farm had actually commenced felling this "giant of the
forest?" This was positively the case, and he was only prevented
from fulfilling his intention by the remonstrance of the settlers
around. This noble specimen of vegetation still bears the marks
of the axe, a memento of the Vandalic taste of him who could
contemplate the destruction of such an interesting object.</p>
<p>Instead of embarking on board the steamer at Maitland, we
proceeded to Newcastle in a carriage, for which act of imprudence
we were almost suffocated by the dust, broiled by an intensely
hot sun, and well nigh jolted to death. The distance is twenty
miles by land, and nearly forty by water. We had one or two
tolerable views of the Hunter, but every thing considered, few
drives could have afforded less interest; and the greater portion
of soil; on each side of the miserable road by which we went,
(deep sand, deep holes, and deep ruts all the way), was generally
of the worst description; but water appeared abundant. The soil
on the banks of this river, (and I believe this is general all
over the colony), is so alluminous, that the water procured from
wells is not often fit to drink. I saw two wells, one not less
than 120 feet in depth, and the other above sixty; the water in
the former was bad, and in the latter nauseous.</p>
<p>This circumstance causes great inconvenience to the settlers
generally, as they are obliged to employ a man with a dray, and
from two to six or eight bullocks, to bring a supply from the
nearest stream or creek, which may be at some distance from the
house. I have known instances where, in dry weather, there is not
a drop of water within from <i>three to four miles;</i> but this
was not on the Hunter.</p>
<p>In England, if I recollect rightly, for I am no disciple of
Tubal-Cain, kettles wear out externally, while there is always a
sediment inside, which is removed. In New South Wales, on the
contrary, there is no sediment, but the kettle becomes thickly
coated with rust, which abrades the metal until it is quite
honeycombed; and even the cast-iron kettles made in England, and
well tinned, last but a short time.</p>
<p>Newcastle was a penal settlement, and a very improving little
town: at present, in consequence of the communication between
this district and Sydney being carried on from Maitland, it is
rapidly becoming deserted; nor indeed is there any inducement to
settle there, as the land about it is bad, and not fit for
cultivation. It is prettily enough situated, though rather
exposed; and from the church there is a view of the ocean, as
also of a considerable tract of melancholy forest; it takes in
likewise the river.</p>
<p>All the coal sent to Sydney is supplied from this place by the
Australian company, who have a large coal-mine here; the quantity
exported can hardly repay the cost of working it. Veins of this
mineral are also found in the cliffs of Nobby's Island, a
remarkable rock or islet at the entrance of the port, and very
near the town; and it is found on other parts of the Hunter as
well.</p>
<p>Newcastle is 70 miles from Sydney by water, and nearly 150 by
land.</p>
<p>There are several streams at no great distance from the
Hunter; such are the Paterson, Williams, Chichester, and others,
on all which the locations are numerous; but I do not imagine
that many of the owners reside upon them, as I was informed they
are at present employed more as stock-stations. The country about
them (150 miles from Sydney,) is characterized as open forest
land, affording excellent pasture, with <i>small</i> flats or
strips of alluvial soil on the banks of the rivers, a remark that
may be applied to all the rivers, as they are called, in the
colony, and here and there "vine brush," in which are found
cedars and other useful trees.</p>
<p>There are also settlers on the Manning; between it and the
Williams there is a tract of thirty or forty miles, perfectly
useless, being covered with scrub, and the soil worthless.</p>
<p>Contrast the names of the rivers in this district with those
in Argyle, <i>per ex</i>. the Cookburndoon, Wallondilli,
Uringalla, Ooromèa, Narjongoolmar, Windelláma, Caradùlla,
Yaràlla, etc. etc., and then decide whether the <i>sonorous</i>
titles of the former, or the modest terms of the latter, are the
more euphonous!</p>
<p>From Newcastle to Port Stephens, the distance by the coast is
not above twenty miles; but to proceed by this route, the Hunter
must be crossed at the former place, as otherwise a person would
have to go round by Maitland, which would make it much
farther.</p>
<p>Although it is not above 180 miles from Sydney to Port
Macquarrie by sea, by land it is 100 more. I have already stated
that this settlement is increasing fast, and there is no doubt of
its being very soon a place of consequence, when steam-vessels
are more numerous.</p>
<p>One most essential advantage that the Hunter district has over
Bathurst and Argyle, is its proximity to a market, for the
steam-boat can easily reach Sydney in twelve hours; while a dray
occupies <i>three weeks</i> in performing the journey from
Bathurst to Sydney and back, and probably not less from Goulbourn
Plains. Here is at once a far more substantial reason than its
park-like scenery, for preferring it to the other two
districts.</p>
<p>There are the materials of a most excellent society in this
part of the colony: unluckily the farms are so far asunder, that
is to say, from eight to fifteen miles, that a free intercourse
cannot well be kept up; and then again, many of the respectable
proprietors of land reside in Sydney. Whether this absence of
social communication would accord with the feelings and ideas of
every one, I cannot of course say: some of the settlers
themselves seem to have no objection to a retired life; but they
are all married, which makes a wonderful difference!</p>
<p>As Moreton Bay has not been thrown open to location, and as
some time may elapse before this will be the case, I have said
nothing concerning its capabilities in respect to unlocated land,
etc. when pointing out the different parts of New South Wales,
where any is to be found; indeed it may be considered, at
present, as quite a distinct portion of the colony, just as
Norfolk Island is.</p>
<p>The following remarks are by Capt. C. of the 17th regiment,
and I was permitted to transcribe them through the kindness of
Col. D. of the same regiment.</p>
<p>"In point of climate, Moreton Bay being farther to the
northward, must, on the whole, be warmer than Sydney; and
although we have no hot winds here, the thermometer ranges,
during the summer, from 80 to 100, but I have seldom felt it so
oppressive as in India; and the nights are generally cool and
pleasant. In winter, except at our highest station, ice has
hardly ever been seen: the mornings and evenings, however, are
generally very chilly, and for several months constant fires are
agreeable: at this season the climate may be considered as
delightful. From the greater heat, all tropical plants thrive
better than at Sydney, but bananas, plaintains, and pines, are
the only fruits that have yet been tried. Cotton grows well, and
I dare say rice might be cultivated to advantage, as many of the
fields might easily be irrigated.</p>
<p>"Wheat is very liable to fail; but as it succeeds in hotter
climes, I have no doubt of its eventually doing so here, if we
are allowed to use ploughs, and to try the soil higher up the
country; nor do English potatoes thrive, for they soon degenerate
into sweet potatoes, which, however, are better here than in any
part of the world that I have hitherto visited. The principal
article cultivated at the settlement is maize, which grows very
luxuriantly, on what is termed "Scrub Land," being neither more
nor less than patches of ground, which, in their original state,
have been covered by almost impenetrable brushwood. Upon this
soil we can have two crops of maize in the year; but unless the
winter sets in very mild, the second is not good. On the
forest-land generally, near the settlement, nothing but cotton
succeeds, as the soil is very poor; higher up, where our flocks
are, and where we bum lime, there are thousands of acres of rich
land almost without trees, well watered, with plenty of coal and
lime; and the side next us has a long, but very good water
communication with the sea.</p>
<p>"This part of the country, I am, also inclined to believe,
would be more healthy than where we now reside, from its being
drier, and more elevated. I am, however, far from thinking our
present place of abode unhealthy, although fever and ague have,
of late, been rather prevalent; but these were not known when
first I came here, and probably may not always continue to annoy
us. It is strange that during the last very hot weather, when
these complaints were most prevalent, the soldiers suffered more
than the convicts; and we had from 10 to 15 sick: such a
circumstance never occurred before nor since. Often we have no
sick military, rarely more than two or three; and in the course
of seven years, the period that has elapsed since the
establishment of the settlement, only one soldier has died, and
his complaint was dropsy!</p>
<p>"Of twelve hundred persons, I have at times known only seven
or eight to be sick at once; these were principally old men with
chronic incurable disorders, and worn out constitutions. Though
the half year ending June, 1832, was considered unhealthy, of
twelve hundred persons only <i>five</i> died; and in all
likelihood they would have died in any other part of the world,
as they were all old and exhausted."</p>
<p>The country between Moreton Bay and Port Macquarrie does not
appear to have been much explored, and will most probably be
found to resemble what is seen elsewhere: the distance is 264
miles. When thrown open to location, the former place will no
doubt afford most eligible farms for the settler.</p>
<p>I have now described all the most distant settlements, and
although it may perhaps be thought that I have given rather too
cursory a view of them, and of the intermediate country, yet from
the general sameness of the features in the aspect of New South
Wales, I could not have said more without being tedious and
prolix; nor would the reader have been much benefitted if I had
devoted a volume to this subject alone.</p>
<p>One of the most cheerful portions of the colony is the tract
of country extending from the head of the valley of Mulgoa to
Windsor. The valley itself is ten or twelve miles long, but in
some places of no great width, and the land is very undulating,
affording some extremely pretty points of view; there is also
excellent soil in various parts of it. It is here that the
junction of the western, or Cowpasture River,.and the Warragamba,
takes place, which is at a spot that forms a basin, enclosed by
lofty crags, and displaying a scene of wild and savage grandeur,
such as is not often observed. The bold and picturesque rocks at
the confluence of the two streams, are of sandstone, and in some
places form caves which have afforded shelter to bushrangers.</p>
<p>The Wollondilly takes its rise somewhere in Argyle: after
flowing some distance, it passes through the Cowpastures, hence
its second name; on its junction with the Warragamba it becomes
the Nepean, and finally, at Windsor, is termed the Hawkesbury.
Its course is about two hundred miles.</p>
<p>Native dogs are sometimes numerous between the upper part of
Mulgoa and the Cowpastures, and it was here I first hunted them.
Taking with me a man named Tribe, who was excellent as a guide,
and equally so at finding the game, but whose movements were
scarcely commensurate with my ideas of celerity, perhaps in
consequence of his having passed the meridian of his vigour, I
set out at dawn of day, and rode no great distance before a large
dog was seen, which we pursued and killed, after a run of a mile:
the next we killed was much smaller, and had only time to run a
few yards; and we caught a third, but our greyhounds would not
hold him, so that before we could get through some fences that
were in our way, they lost him.</p>
<p>There is some satisfaction in hunting this animal, but the fox
is permitted to exist for the sole purpose of affording amusement
in the pursuit; the native dog often commits such ravages amongst
the sheep and poultry, that it is absolutely necessary either to
destroy it, or, at all events, to expel it from the inhabited
parts of the colony; therefore a person has not the
dissatisfaction of reflecting that he is guilty of wanton
cruelty; and yet even with this reflection, I must confess myself
not a little partial to indulging also in the pursuit of poor
renard.</p>
<p>Tribe related to me an affair that he had with a native dog,
which may perhaps amuse the reader, and will at least shew him,
that when hunting, it is possible, even in New South Wales, to
catch a Tartar; and that, consequently, it is as well to be
cautious not to make too free with him until dead. It also
furnishes a striking instance of the tenacity of life which this
creature possesses: I shall give Tribe's story in his own
words:&mdash;</p>
<p>"One day, Sir, I comes upon a large native dog, and after a
long run we catches him. Well, Sir, my dog pitches into the
joker, and I supposes they had killed him; so I dismounts, and
ties my horse up, while my dogs goes to a water-hole to drink.
Then I takes the native dog by the leg, and draws my knife across
his hock, meaning to skin him, as his hide was worth half a
crown; but I had no sooner done this, than up he jumps, and tries
to lay hold of me by the throat! So I kicks him, and thumps him,
and swears at him," (the last ought to have had some effect,)
"but all to no purpose; whereupon I was obliged to scramble up
again on my horse, and halloo for my dogs, which pitched it into
him until he was quite dead, and afterwards I cuts his throat to
make sure! By gollins, Sir, you never catches me skinning another
native dog before I have cut his throat!"</p>
<p>The best way of hunting the animal is with foxhounds or
harriers.</p>
<p>At Regentville, situated very near the Nepean, which is here a
beautiful piece of water, with some highly interesting scenery,
the country becomes more open, much land has been cleared, and
from the house there is a very extensive view towards Windsor. On
the right of the river the soil is of the most fertile
description, the settlers are numerous, and there is a
considerable portion of land in cultivation. On the left bank are
Emu plains, backed by a range of the Blue Mountains, which extend
to the sea. There are some farms on the sides of the hills, but
on account of the abruptness of the declivities as well as the
nature of the soil they are not numerous.</p>
<p>Windsor is thirty-four miles from Sydney, and about
twenty-five from that part of the river which is crossed on the
route to the Hunter. It is a small and ill-built place, and it is
in this neighbourhood that the floods, caused by the Hawkesbury,
are so disastrous. The greatest height to which this river has
been known to rise is estimated at <i>ninety</i> feet; and from
fifty to eighty feet is not uncommon!</p>
<p>The houses in this district are the best that are to be found
in the "Bush," most of the settlers in the other parts of the
country residing in their original huts, some of which have been
erected eight or ten years or more; or else they have built small
cottages, which, although very clean and neat, are often much too
small for families. However, those who reside between the Blue
Mountains and Sydney can scarcely be said to be settled in the
"Bush."</p>

<p><span class="aa">New</span> Holland is the largest island on
the globe, being nearly 2,000 miles from north to south, and
nearly 2,500 from east to west; it is comprised between the
parallels of 10 deg. south, and 39 deg. south, and the meridians
of 154 deg. east, and 113 deg. east.</p>
<p>It was first visited by the Portuguese and Spaniards in the
sixteenth century; though the Dutch, who explored the west coast
in 1605, were the first who made it known to Europe.</p>
<p>Between the years 1616 and 1641 the coasts were several times
visited by Dutch ships; and in 1642 Abel Tasman was sent to
complete the survey of them. In 1688 Dampier fell in with the
island, and afterwards paid it a second visit; since which period
it had been frequently visited by navigators, and in 1788 was
colonized.</p>
<p>Australasia is a general term, and commonly includes New
Holland, Van Dieman's Land, and other islands in the South Seas.
Australia is a denomination of New South Wales, or the eastern
half of New Holland, and western Australia of the remainder.</p>
<p>The island is separated from New Guinea by Torres' Straits,
which are about eighty miles wide, and contain a great number of
islands, besides a multitude of coral reefs and banks. These
rendered the navigation extremely dangerous and difficult, until
the publication of Captain King's directions for sailing through;
by following them, the difficulty is now so materially lessened,
that ships frequently proceed from Sydney by this route. This
passage is advantageous only as a way from the east coast of New
Holland, shortening the distance both to India and China.</p>
<p>The proper season for passing through the straits commences
about the end of February, and ends in October, that is to say,
during the easterly monsoon, but for the remainder of the year
the passage ought not to be attempted; as the westerly monsoon,
besides being a contrary wind, is generally accompanied by much
bad and gloomy weather, with frequent storms, which, independent
of the danger of shipwreck, cause great delay in the voyage.</p>
<p>Navigators have seen snakes * of large size swimming about the
Straits, but of what description they are I have never been able
to learn; though if what the captain of a vessel told me be true,
it would appear that some of them must be poisonous. He stated
that while a Newfoundland dog was amusing itself with swimming
round the ship during a calm, a snake, eight or nine feet in
length approached and bit the animal, which was immediately taken
on board, but only survived a few hours.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Snakes are often seen in the Bay of Bengal,
Straits of Malacca, and Timor Sea: their length is from four or
five to seven or eight feet, and their colour is yellow, with
black and brown spots. They are seen only in fine weather, and
always move very sluggishly.<br>
<br>
Peron, in the Naturaliste, while on a voyage of discovery, saw
sea-snakes from 300 to 400 miles from land. They were from one to
thirteen feet in length. Snakes are found also in the Persian
Gulf, Red Sea, etc.]</p>
<p>From Van Dieman's Land, or Tasmania, New Holland is divided by
Bass's Straits, 120 miles in breadth, and containing several
islands of little note, of which mention will be made
hereafter.</p>
<p>I shall now take a rapid glance at the coasts, and add one
short extract from Flinders, leaving the reader to consult the
various works that have been published for any farther
information concerning them.</p>
<p>The description of Port Jackson will be given when speaking of
Sydney: at present I shall merely remark that the light House is
in 33 deg. 51 min. south, and 151 deg. 20 min. east. The entrance
to the harbour is between two enormous cliffs not quite two miles
apart; both of these are rugged and precipitous, and in many
places the appearance of the rocks is extremely grand and
striking. Some of the cliffs are partially excavated by the
waves, forming caverns or arches; and several of the headlands
are uncommonly magnificent. On leaving Port Jackson, and
proceeding to the northward, we come to Broken Bay, where the
Hawkesbury falls into the sea. Several vessels have been built
there, and ships of burden may find shelter in it; but this bay
is very little frequented.</p>
<p>Port Hunter is the entrance to the river of that name, and
ships of 300 tons have loaded there; I have already noticed it,
as also Port Stevens, and Port Macquarrie.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** Oxley describes the country about Port
Macquarrie as very beautiful. The Port, however, is only adapted
for vessels of 100 tons.]</p>
<p>Moreton Bay is in 27 deg. 1 min. south; and 153 deg. 26 min.
east. The bay is a considerable expanse of water, sheltered by an
island, and on the bar there is a depth of eighteen feet. The
Brisbane, thought to be the largest river on the east coast,
falls into the bay, and the latter is said to be 60 miles in
extent.</p>
<p>From the latitude of 25 deg. south to the northern extremity
of Australia, a distance of 850 miles, Captain King says he saw
neither rivers, nor springs, of any consequence; and although, in
some parts the country was well wooded, and of a pleasant aspect,
this ceased to be the case to the northward of Endeavour River,
whence to the North Cape, in lat. 10 deg. 43 min. south lon., 142
deg. 39 min. east, 300 miles, the country is quite barren.
Endeavour River is the place where Cook repaired his ship after
having been many hours on a coral reef; it is not adapted for
large vessels unless when actually in distress.</p>
<p>Breaksea Spit commences in about 25 deg. south, and is a vast
barrier reef of coral, extending to New Guinea, that is, upwards
of 1,000 miles. In some places it is from 90 to 100 miles from
the land; towards the south it occupies a breadth of from 45 to
50 miles, but is narrower to the north; and in lat. 16 deg.
south, it closes in with the shore at Cape Tribulation. For more
than 350 miles from the south opening of the spit there is no
entrance that, can be trusted as safe: there are openings, but
these are very dangerous. It is said, that on this part of the
coast no settlement could be formed; but as the sea, between the
barrier and the land, is so smooth that small vessels can
navigate it with ease, it is not unlikely that when a steam
vessel is employed to examine it more minutely, its colonization
will not be found impracticable.</p>
<p>Captain Flinders has given such an excellent, and at the same
time interesting account of the formation of coral banks, that a
perusal of it cannot fail to entertain the reader, and I have
therefore extracted it verbatim.</p>
<p>"Half-way island, to the east of Torres' Straits, is scarcely
more than a mile in circumference, but appears to be increasing
both in elevation and extent. At no very distant period of time,
it was one of those banks produced by the washing up of the sand
and broken coral, of which most reefs afford instances, and those
in Torres' Straits a great many. These banks are in different
stages of progress; some, like this, are become islands, but not
yet habitable; some are above high-watermark, but destitute of
vegetation; whilst others are overflowed with every returning
tide.</p>
<p>"It seems to me that when the animalculæ, which form the
corals at the bottom of the ocean, cease to live, their
structures adhere to each other, by virtue either of the
glutinous remains within, or of some property in salt water; and
the interstices being gradually filled up with sand and broken
pieces of coral washed by the sea, which also adhere, a mass of
rock is at length formed. Future races of these animalcules erect
their habitations upon the rising bank, and die in their turn, to
increase, but principally to elevate, this monument of their
wonderful labours. The care taken to work perpendicularly in the
early stages, would mark a surprising instinct in these
diminutive creatures! Their wall of coral, for the most part, in
situations where the winds are constant, being arrived at the
surface, affords a shelter to leeward so that their infant
colonies may be safely sent forth: and to this their instinctive
foresight it seems to be owing, that the part of the reef which
is exposed to the open sea, is generally, if not always, the
highest part, and rises almost perpendicularly, sometimes from
the depth of 200, and perhaps many more fathoms. To be constantly
covered with water seems necessary to the existence of these
animalcules, for they do not work, except upon holes in the reef,
beyond low-water mark; but the coral, sand, and other broken
fragments thrown up by the sea, adhere to the rock, and form a
solid mass with it, as high as the common tides reach. That
elevation surpassed, the future remnants, being rarely covered,
lose their adhesive quality, and remaining in a loose state, form
what is usually called a <i>key</i> upon the top of the reef. The
new bank is not long in being visited by sea-birds; salt water
plants take root upon it, and a soil begins to be formed; a cocoa
nut, or the drupe of a pandanus is thrown on shore; land birds
visit it, and deposit the seeds of shrubs and trees; every high
tide, and still more, every gale, adds something to the bank: the
form of an island is gradually assumed; and last of all comes man
to take possession."</p>
<p>Since Flinders wrote, several of the coral banks which he
describes are become partially covered with vegetation.</p>
<p>The width of the entrance to the Gulf of Carpentaria,* from
Cape York to Cape Arnheim, is 338 miles, and the gulf itself is
nearly 1,200 miles in circuit. It is into this immense gulf that
some of the principal rivers of New South Wales are supposed to
flow; which appears to be an assumption not at all corroborated
by the testimony of navigators, particularly Flinders, (and I
think Capt. King); nor can we perceive amidst the various
theories of those who have written concerning this point, any
particularly good or forcible reasons for assuming that such is
the fact; for we are told that the gulf has already been
examined, and that if any considerable rivers had fallen into
it, they must have been discovered.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Flinders sailed 500 miles in this gulf and saw
only one elevation of a hundred feet.]</p>
<p>From Captain King's account, the best harbours, with the
exception of Port Jackson, are on the north coasts.</p>
<p>On the east and north-east coasts shell-fish of prodigious
dimensions have been seen; even so large as <i>three feet in
length</i>, and weighing, shell and all, nearly <i>two hundred
pounds</i>; a friend of mine told me they were strong, and not
very palatable; and added that he had seen them even much larger.
Dampier says he found an empty shell which weighed 258 lbs! The
<i>bêche de mer</i> is found on all the reefs on the east coast,
but is little sought for there: on the north-west coast, however,
the Malays seek for it with the greatest avidity for the Chinese
market. I found a specimen at Swan River, but believe it is not
common there. It is also called the Trepang.</p>
<p>Melville Island is 370 miles from Cape Arnheim; and close to
it is Bathurst Island. On the former a settlement was formed,
with the view of establishing a commerce with the Malays and
others; it failed from several causes. 1. The Malays did not
appear inclined to engage in a trade with the colony. 2. The soil
was so bad that no grain would thrive in it. 3. The aborigines
were inimical to the colonists, and killed several of them. 4.
When a vessel went from Sydney to the island it was obliged,
during many months in the year, to return by the western coast,
thereby circumnavigating New Holland! Consequently the island was
subsequently deserted. Each of the islands is about 100 miles in
circumference, and they are separated by a channel only a
gun-shot across. Both are inhabited, and the natives, as also the
animals, resemble those on the main land. Lat. 11 deg. 56 min.
south, long. 130 deg. 55 min. east.</p>
<p>The next conspicuous spot to which we come is North West Cape,
1,140 miles from the above islands; and in lat. 21 deg. 47 min.
south, long. 114 min. east. On the whole of this vast line of
coast, there are no known rivers, and the appearance of the land
is represented to be sandy, barren, and sterile!</p>
<p>Shark's Bay, discovered by Dampier, is a spacious and safe
harbour 236 miles from North West Cape, and nearly 400 to the
northward of Swan River. The land about it is sandy, barren,
destitute of inhabitants, and without water; at least such was
its inhospitable aspect as described by those who visited it. I
am greatly inclined to doubt if this spot has been hitherto
sufficiently explored, especially in the interior. A good harbour
is of such consequence in a colony where so few ports are known
to exist, that provided land of a fair description was discovered
at no great distance in the interior, it is of no very essential
consequence what kind of soil prevails near the shores. The
latitude is 25 deg. 43 min. south.</p>
<p>Passing Swan River we come to Cape Lewin, in lat. 34 deg. 22
min. south, long. 115 deg. 6 min. east, and 136 miles from the
former. This is the south-westernmost point of New Holland; and
vessels are not unfrequently many days before they can weather
it, on account of the north-west winds which so often prevail
here. The distance hence to King George's Sound (to the
south-east) is 150 miles.</p>
<p>The account given by Flinders of the country here was
unfavourable. He says "that through which he passed had but
little to recommend it. The stony hills of the coast were,
indeed, generally covered with shrubs, but there was rarely any
depth of vegetable soil. The land, extending from Princess Royal
harbour to some lakes several miles from the sea, was swampy.
There the surface is clothed with grass and brushwood, and on the
parts a little elevated there are forest trees; nevertheless the
soil is shallow, and unfit for cultivation. The sound is
sheltered from all winds except those from the eastward, but the
inner harbour will only admit small vessels. From all I have
heard of this settlement, it does not seem to be in a very
thriving state.</p>
<p>Spencer's Gulf runs about 190 miles into the land, and is
fifty or sixty miles wide at the entrance. The distance from the
sound is 870 miles, nearly east. Near it is the Gulf of St.
Vincent, also of considerable extent: the country about the
latter is superior to that on the shores of the former.</p>
<p>Port Lincoln, on the western side of the entrance to Spencer's
Gulf, is considered a good harbour, with the disadvantage of
having no constant run of fresh water, which is therefore
procured by digging, and even then greatly discoloured by the
clay. The country around is rocky and barren, with a sufficiency
of grass, bushes, and small trees, not to look quite
desolate.</p>
<p>From hence to Cape Otway, we may reckon 246 miles; and to
Wilson's Promontory 150 miles farther. Between the two last are
Port Phillip and Western Port: the former, which is the
westernmost harbour on the north side of Bass's Straits, is
seventeen or eighteen leagues to the north-eastward of Cape
Otway, and although an excellent harbour, labours under a
deficiency of fresh water: the latter is eight or nine leagues
from Port Phillip, and may be chosen as a place of shelter, if a
ship is driven near its entrance by a southerly gale. The coast
between the two ports presents a continued barrier of rock, with
a heavy swell tumbling in from the south-west.</p>
<p>Although Port Phillip is capable of receiving the largest
fleet that ever went to sea, it labours under this great
disadvantage, that the entrance, in its whole width, is scarcely
two miles, nearly half of which is occupied by rocks on the one
side, and shoals on the other.</p>
<p>The country is described to have a fertile appearance, and
some of the vallies are adapted for agricultural purposes: and
although some parts are sterile, there is grass sufficient for
the support of numerous cattle or sheep.</p>
<p>Attempts at colonization have been made at both these places,
but owing to want of water, and the nature of soil, they
failed.</p>
<p>Wilson's Promontory is a lofty mass of hard granite, about 20
miles long, and from 6 to 14 wide. The soil upon it is shallow
and barren, though the brushwood, dwarf gum trees, etc. which
cover the rocks give it a deceitful appearance to the distant
observer. From hence to Cape Howe, 241 miles, the shores are
sandy, with barren land behind. The interior is mountainous, but
not having been much explored, very little is known concerning
it.</p>
<p>Twofold Bay, 30 miles from the Cape, is chiefly adapted for
small vessels only, being greatly exposed to easterly winds: as
nothing larger than boats can find shelter on the line of coast
from Jervis Bay, lat. 35° 6" S. to Furneaux Isles in 40° 30", it
becomes of importance to whalers, and ships passing along the
coast. The soil of the contiguous hills is good, and water is
tolerably abundant. The entrance to Jervis Bay, 100 miles to the
northward, is 2 miles wide, and inside there is a bay or harbour,
from three to four leagues in length, and two in width. It is
considered a safe port for ships of any size, but although only
80 miles from Sydney, is very little resorted to.</p>
<p>The land immediately round the bay is mostly barren, as is
commonly found to be the case near the coast. On the eastern side
it is chiefly rocky, with brushwood; the western is low, swampy,
and sandy, with some partial exceptions; on the south there are
grassy places, which might afford pasturage for cattle.</p>
<p>Botany Bay is 6 miles from Sydney, and is of great extent;
during tempestuous weather from the eastward it forms a very
indifferent anchorage. It was here, as in feet must be pretty
well known, that the settlement was first established; and at the
head of the Bay is Cook's River, while George's River falls into
it near the entrance. Very few persons reside on its shores.</p>
<p>As a general observation upon the coast, it may be remarked
that most navigators speak of the Gulph of Carpentaria in no very
favourable terms; and certainly, judging from the various
accounts of it, the country about its shores must have a most
dreary and inhospitable appearance. Such also is the description
of the coast from Cape Arnheim to North-west Cape, and thence to
Swan River, a distance of 2,116 miles!</p>
<p>When I inform the reader that such too is the case with
respect to a great portion of the south and east coasts, he will
be able to form some slight idea how desolate and melancholy must
be the general aspect of the shores of this immense island. The
circumference of New Holland is about 6,000 miles, that is,
without following strictly all the inflections of the bays,
etc.</p>
<p>The weather on the coast is extremely uncertain and variable,
often very stormy, and seldom to be depended upon. Lightning
generally denotes a change, and is commonly considered the
precursor of bad weather.</p>
<p>The last time I left Sydney we experienced, during three
successive nights, the most awful lightning I ever beheld.</p>
<p>In consequence of the frequent gales and heavy sea, vessels
employed in whaling prefer the neighbourhood of New Zealand, and
other islands, and also of the Equator.</p>
<p>Of the general appearance of the country, it is difficult to
convey an adequate idea to the reader, for it is so different
from any other region I ever beheld, that I am at a loss what to
compare it with. Of the mountains scarcely enough is known to
enable me to impart any really accurate information concerning
them. A barrier range is supposed to run parallel to the east
coast, and another on some parts of the west coast, particularly
at, and south of, Swan River: from Cape Jervis also there is a
ridge, 3,000 feet in height, and 210 miles in length, which joins
the ridge on the east side of Spencer's Gulf.</p>
<p>The direction, however, of the various ramifications which
extend into the interior, seems to be extremely irregular, for to
whatever point the eye is directed vast groups of mountains are
visible; and a person, judging only from that part of the country
at present known, would be led to suppose the entire island a
congeries of mountains or hills, separated by narrow, and deep
gullies and ravines, with occasional valleys, usually of no great
width, and covered in some places by open forest, but in more by
forests that are almost impenetrable. The naturally clear spots
are few in number, and extremely circumscribed, when compared
with the extent of the colony; nor is it until he reaches a
distance of 200 miles from the coast that the astonished
traveller emerges from the maze of mountains and woody
wildernesses and finds himself on the boundless Corborn
Comleroy!</p>
<p>Some future Park will probably explore the country beyond; and
we shall then know how true, or false, the tales are which have
been communicated by the <i>aborigines</i> (with whose language
we are very imperfectly acquainted), and swallowed by the
credulity of those who believe that every thing connected with
the interior must be wonderful and extraordinary.</p>
<p>The extent of the colony of New South Wales was, in 1829,
34,500 square miles, or upwards of 22,000,000 of acres; it must
be greatly increased since the country about Port Macquarrie was
thrown open to location.</p>
<p>Such vast tracts are seen where the soil is utterly worthless,
that the proportion of good land to the absolutely bad, or
indifferent, is very trifling; and where fertile soil is found it
is ever in patches of no extent, excepting at places where it
would not repay the labours of the agriculturist, from its being
at too remote a distance from a market. Of the rivers much has
been both said and written; but whatever may be the opinions of
writers concerning them, they are mere streams; for although
their height is great during floods, they are more commonly
navigable to a distance of not mare than thirty or forty miles
from the sea, and seldom so much.</p>
<p>It is conjectured that the Lachlan is the channel by which all
the waters rising in those ranges to the west of Port Jackson,
known by the name of the Blue Mountains, and which do not fall
into the sea on the east coast, are conveyed to the immense
inland marshes. The course of this river, according to Oxley,
exceeds 500 miles in a straight line, and including its windings,
it flows at least 1,200. It rises sometimes 36 feet; but in dry
seasons the channel is empty, or forms only a chain of ponds.</p>
<p>There is not in fact known to exist one really navigable river
in the whole Island, exclusive of the Morumbidgee and Murray, of
which I strongly suspect very little is known, save that the last
was of some depth when first visited; and that the expedition, in
returning, found the body of water greatly diminished! A single
visit to a river in this country cannot possibly enable any one
to form a correct opinion as to its usual average depth.</p>
<p>The stockmen * at Wellington Valley procured a piece of
information, in 1828, which would have been of no small
consequence to the colony, if true; and I shall, therefore,
extract it from the periodical in which I accidentally observed
it, just to show with what facility marvellous stories are
snatched up, and circulated by those who do not take time to
consider.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Stockmen are convicts, who are appointed to
look after the cattle and sheep: sometimes free, or "ticket of
leave" men, are appointed instead.]</p>
<p>"The tribes who occupy the country two or three days' journey
from Wellington Valley, have been engaged in war several years
with the tribes living west and north-west; but owing to the
death of one of the chiefs, peace has been at length restored
between them, and these <i>mial</i>, or strange blacks, have
related to their new friends, and these to us" (and doubtless
without losing by the repetition) "that there exists in, the
<i>western</i> country, many days off, a vast interior sea, where
the water is salt, and where <i>whales are seen to spout!</i> The
manner in which they imitated the whale throwing up <i>water was
so completely satisfactory, as to leave little doubt of the
fact</i>, as it is not likely these inland blacks could have
known it but from actual observation. Here, then, is a problem
that will repay the working, and the sooner we are relieved from
the present state of suspense arising from such a report, the
better!"</p>
<p>By making a fair calculation the "great sea" ought to have
been nearly about the centre of the island, so that the "great
fish" must have had to travel up a "great river" to a distance of
some 1,200 miles from the coast! But the "great drought" seems to
have dried up the first, for it has disappeared, and the whales
with it; so that the above writer need not now be "in a state of
suspense!"</p>
<p>The only island that is colonized op the coast of New Holland,
is that of Norfolk, which is a penal settlement, different from
that at Moreton Bay, inasmuch as those persons sent to the former
are generally of the worst description, and most probably sent
there for a long period; while convicts are not sentenced to the
latter for more than seven years.</p>
<p>Its distance from Sydney is about 1,000 miles, and it is 400
to the northward of New Zealand. For the following notices of it
I am indebted to an officer of the Fourth, or King's Own
Regiment, who was stationed there some months.</p>
<p>Norfolk Island, situated in 29 deg. 2 min. south latitude, 168
deg. 13 min. east longitude, is about twenty-one miles in
circumference. The air is very pure, and the climate fine and
temperate, resembling very much that of Portugal, but subject to
sudden squalls, chiefly from the S.E.</p>
<p>The soil is uncommonly fertile, and capable of producing the
fruits and vegetables of every part of the world in perfection;
but care must be taken to shelter fruit trees from the effects of
the southerly winds, which are liable to destroy them by a kind
of blight.</p>
<p>The island is covered with a very thick "brush," and a great
variety of trees, amongst which the pine (<i>pinus insularis</i>)
is the most conspicuous, growing to the height of <i>two hundred
and forty feet</i>, and forming very useful timber: there is also
a tree called the blood wood, so termed from the colour of its
sap, and a variety of others with the botanical names of which I
am unacquainted: some of them are peculiar to the island, and
have never been described. Lemons, citrons, guavas, grapes,
pomegranates, coffee plants and figs, abound in almost all the
gullies. The ferns are numerous and very beautiful, and several
of them are found nowhere else. Every kind of grain can be
cultivated with success: tobacco and sugar canes also thrive
well, particularly the former. The surface is extremely
irregular, consisting of a succession of hills and gullies thrown
together without the slightest appearance of design or order; and
nearly all the gullies are watered by small streams, generally of
the purest water, occasionally mixed with a considerable quantity
of iron.</p>
<p>Mount Pitt, which arises 1,200 feet above the sea, is
basaltic; the rest of the island is commonly pudding-stone and
sand-stone.</p>
<p>There is no safe anchorage on any side of the island, and the
landing is at all times very precarious, the surf rising so very
rapidly as to preclude any certainty even for a very short
time.</p>
<p>The population consists of 800 persons, of whom upwards of 500
are convicts, 124 military, and the remainder civil servants of
the government. The prisoners are employed in building, felling
timber, making roads, and cultivating the farm, on which the
principal grain is maize. Fish are plentiful, and the most
abundant are snappers, trumpeters, salmon, king-fish, gropers,
etc. etc.</p>
<p>The only animals are wild cats, which are common, and rats;
the birds are pigeons, woodquests (a large and handsome kind of
pigeon,) parrots, lories, several kinds of peterel, boatswains,
and sometimes curlew and plover.</p>
<p>From the uncommon verdure which prevails throughout the year,
caused by the frequent showers, the scenery is highly beautiful
and romantic; the lemon and citron trees are seen bending under
the weight of their fruit, and guavas are equally abundant. The
last form the principal food of the rats.</p>
<p>There are several good roads in the island leading to the
different objects considered worthy of notice; the brush,
however, is so thick, that it is a very easy matter to lose one's
way for many hours: in some places it is quite impervious. In the
gullies, New Zealand flax (<i>phormium tenax</i>) is found in
large quantities; the government sent three natives of that
country to instruct the prisoners in dressing it; but either from
want of proper instruments, or as was said of the proper class of
natives, the attempt was, for the most part, a failure.</p>
<p>The Norfolk island pine sometimes attains a most astonishing
size: the following dimensions of one were given me by a medical
gentleman long resident in the island. Diameter near the ground
12 feet; and at the height of 80 feet, nearly 9 feet; to that
height the stem was perfectly straight, but it had then a slight
twist or bend. The total height of the tree was <i>two hundred
and sixty-seven feet!</i> He added that the settlement ought to
have been on the north side of the island, as the landing is much
more easy there: on the south side the colony is so difficult of
approach that vessels are sometimes <i>several weeks</i> off the
place before they can disembark their passengers, or discharge
their cargoes. Another objection to the present site is the
circumstance of there being a morass close by it! As the convicts
who are transported to the island (from Sydney) are those only
who have been convicted of crimes of some enormity, it may easily
be imagined what a set of knaves must be collected together, when
it is considered that in addition to the sentence of
transportation (perhaps for life) pronounced upon them in
England, they are sentenced, in New South Wales, to a second
deportation!</p>
<p>From all that I have heard of this settlement, I should hardly
suppose it can pay its own expenses; of course, as the number of
convicts increase, some other spot must be selected as an
additional penal establishment.</p>
<p>It will perhaps be thought irrelative to the present subject
to introduce any observations on New Zealand, as it has not yet
been colonized by us; but a resident, or consul, having been
recently appointed, I may now consider it as strictly connected
with our Australian settlements. It would, however, be entirely
foreign to my purpose to attempt a regular description of the
islands, and I shall therefore refer the reader for any farther
information he may require, to the works of those who have had
better opportunities of seeing them than myself.</p>
<p>We touched there on our voyage from Sydney to England; but
vessels would probably make a more rapid passage by keeping to
the southward of the islands, at all events iii February or
March, and I understand at some other periods of the year, if
their commanders would escape the contrary winds which we
encountered after making the Three Kings (islets off the north
point,) and which prevented us, for many days, from quitting the
coast after our departure from Kororadica. Besides, little is to
be gained by going there, with the exception of potatoes, pigs,
water, and perchance a few spars. With respect to the first, it
must be admitted they constitute not merely one of the greatest
luxuries on board ship, but one of the most considerable
necessaries, particularly for the crew, who have nothing save
salt provisions. As to water, a supply after such a short run can
scarcely be required, and spars are not always to be
procured.</p>
<p>The New Zealand islands are three in number, the northernmost
of which, called Eahei No Mauwee, is 1100 miles from Sydney. The
average width of this singularly formed island, as far as Woody
Point, a distance of 230 miles, is not more than 30 miles; it
then suddenly expands, the remainder being 220 miles in length,
by a breadth of 120.</p>
<p>Tavai Poenammoo, the centre island, is 450 miles in length by
an average breadth of 100. These two are separated by Cook's
Straits, seventy-five miles wide at the north-west entrance, but
much narrower at the south-east. Stewart's Island is about 100
miles in circumference, and separated from Tavai Poenammoo by a
strait of trifling width; and containing many islands or
rocks.</p>
<p>The north point of Eahei No Mauwee is in lat. 34 deg. 24 min.
south; long. 173 deg. east; and the south point of Stewart's
Island in lat. 47 deg. 20 min. south; long. 167 deg. 40 min.
east.</p>
<p>We anchored in the Bay of Islands on the north-east coast of
Eahei No Mauwee, and 80 miles from the north point. This is one
of the finest and most spacious bays ever beheld, being, in so
far as respects the mere aspect, greatly superior to Port Jackson
itself; but no part of it affords a harbour equally safe. It
contains a great number of ramifications, or arms of the sea,
some of which extend far into the land, and are beautifully
studded with islands that conduce greatly to the general effect;
and when during a calm the land is reflected from the placid
surface of the water, the scene is one that far surpasses any of
the prospects in the vicinity of the Australian capital. If the
views, in the present neglected state of the place, are often
fine, what may we not expect when the country becomes colonized
and cultivated? I do not mean to imply that the land where we
anchored is remarkable for its scenery, the most interesting
prospects being farther up the inlets or rivers; but even on the
shores of the bay itself, cultivation will soon cause a wonderful
change. There are two streams which fall into the bay, one is the
Wye Catte, the other is named the Cower-Cower; and rivulets are
also found.</p>
<p>New Zealand may be considered, on the whole, a mountainous
country, some part of it rising to a considerable elevation,
particularly on Tavai Poenammoo, where the mountains are very
lofty, and, as viewed from the sea, constitute an extremely bold
feature in the landscape. This was particularly observable from
the ship while near White Island&mdash;a curious volcano on that
coast. At the Bay of Islands the surface is more commonly
undulating, though approaching occasionally to the alpine. There
did not appear to be any forests of consequence near the bay, but
much of the land is concealed by brushwood or fern, while the
gullies, or ravines, are filled with a variety of trees that form
an almost impenetrable wilderness. Nor is there any level land on
its shores&mdash;not even a few acres, except in one or two
places, where a small patch of very trifling extent may be
discerned. The soil is extremely rich, both close to the water
and upon eminences of considerable height, and apparently adapted
for all the purposes of husbandry, but we found no grass.</p>
<p>Of the natives we saw many, and they are with justice
considered a fine race of people, being well formed, athletic,
and active. One of them, who came to England in the same ship
with myself, although, for a New Zealander, by no means a
powerful man, gave us a specimen of his strength, and at the same
time convinced the crew that he was not to be annoyed with
impunity, for he lifted one of them by the heels, and then
knocked his head against the anchor. If the man had not been
rescued, either his head or the anchor would have sustained some
material injury. They were all, in a greater or less degree,
tattooed&mdash;the chiefs, however, much more so than the others;
and some of them carry this to such an extent, that the
countenance seemed to have been marked in every pore. In most of
them the face and the rear had alone been tatooed; indeed the
latter was frequently far more elaborately ornamented than the
former, and the effect was so ludicrous as to excite our mirth,
in which the people themselves joined, though well aware of the
cause of it. Some of them had long hair, while in others it was
short and curly; they took little trouble in dressing it.</p>
<p>The women, if I may be allowed to judge from those we saw, are
not worthy of the praises that have been bestowed upon their
beauty; the only really good-looking young female among them was
the offspring of an Englishman, (I abuse the name) and a
native.</p>
<p>I had always been led to believe the New Zealanders were
extremely brave, and was therefore not a little disappointed,
when informed on the spot, that they do not possess the courage
attributed to them by the early navigators; and that so far from
engaging openly and fairly, they are in the habit of attacking
their enemies by surprise. They talk of battles as if they were
nothing but a pastime or recreation, and they certainly appear to
be always warring with each other; but we were told that not
unfrequently, when they pretend they are going to slay and devour
their enemies, their arms have been miraculously converted into
potatoes, and their implacable foes into a marvellous herd of
fine hogs, both of which were cooked and consumed without
compunction by the <i>soi-disant</i> combatants; or, to speak
more soberly, they had gone to meet another and friendly tribe,
in order to have a feast.</p>
<p>I take it for granted they sometimes display their martial
ardour, as we hear of sanguinary encounters, in which the amount
of the slain is rather considerable, furnishing to the victors a
plentiful though horrible banquet.</p>
<p>All voyagers unite in believing these people to be
anthropophagi, but they have not been proved to be so from any
absolute predilection for human flesh. It is supposed they
believe, (and as many of their theological opinions are well
known, the conjecture is probably a correct one) that if the body
of an enemy be devoured, his soul will pass into everlasting
fire, there to be tormented to the end of time; but if interred
with all due formality, it will be received into a habitation
more congenial to it. Even granting this not to be the fact,
those persons who have been most among them, and who had
opportunities of studying their character, assert most
positively, that in eating an enemy whom they have slain, they
are persuaded they will become possessed of the valour and
abilities of the defunct.</p>
<p>Cook observes, that among other reasons which he had heard
assigned for the prevalence of this horrible custom, the want of
animal food was one; but how far this is deducible from facts or
circumstances, must be left for those to find out who advanced
it. In every part of New Zealand where he had been, fish was in
such plenty that the natives caught as much as served themselves
and his crew. They had also plenty of dogs; nor was there any
want of wild fowl, which they know very well how to kill: so that
neither this nor the want of food of any kind can be the
reason.</p>
<p>If such was Cook's opinion sixty years since it is not likely
that at the present time, when in addition to fish and fern root,
the natives have abundance of potatoes, maize, and pork, they
would eat human flesh from preference. "Human flesh," remarks one
of our best historians, "was never used as common food in any
country; and the various relations concerning people who reckoned
it among the stated means of subsistence, flow from the credulity
and mistakes of travellers."</p>
<p>The most strange instance of cannibalism known to exist, is
that practised by the Battas, a nation of Summatra; their
anthropophagism however is judicial, for they do not eat their
enemies, but only those condemned to death for some crime. In one
respect the New Zealanders must be more humane than those
miscreants, as they never wantonly inflict pain, putting the
victim to death at once, instead of employing the revolting mode,
common with the Battas, of cutting up a human being in such a
manner as to avoid, so long as possible, injuring a vital
part.</p>
<p>For my own part, I must still maintain that there is no proof
of any nation being naturally cannibals; although, from
constantly indulging in a vindictive feeling towards their foes,
they may not only have overcome the repugnance usually felt by
mankind to eat human flesh, but even to have contracted a liking
for it.</p>
<p>War is said to be almost as natural to mortals as peace; if we
may form an opinion from the pugnacious disposition of the South
Sea Islanders, it is far more so, peace of any duration being
scarcely known to exist among them; for the transient intervals
during which they are not actually engaged in warfare, are for
the most part occupied in concocting some act of aggression; and
although their conflicts may not often be sanguinary, they are
very frequent.</p>
<p>Rousseau tells us, that great eaters of flesh are commonly
cruel, and cites as an example the barbarity of the English; by a
parity of reasoning the New Zealanders, who, before the
introduction of pigs, fed principally upon roots, shell-fish, and
other fish, ought to have been remarkable for the suavity and
softness of their manners, unless the circumstance of their
occasionally eating an enemy may be supposed to have had the
effect of rendering them otherwise. Whatever their fare may be,
whether fish or flesh, they are notorious for ferocity,
treachery, and revenge; and are never to be trusted as a body,
unless when the weaker party. They are also great thieves,
(which, according to the authority of a celebrated writer, I
think Lord Kames, is the case with all islanders,) crafty, and
idle, considering time of no value. For the "Indian weed" they
betray as great a <i>penchant</i> as the New Hollanders, pipes
and tobacco constituting a considerable article of barter; but
gunpowder and muskets have of late become somewhat reduced in
value, although still exchanged to great advantage, by the
whites, for provisions, etc. The pigs roam where they please, and
the flavour of the pork is sufficient to tempt an Israelite,
while the potatoes are of such fine quality as to be esteemed not
inferior to the best in England. These are sown in holes made
with a stick, as the land does not go through any preparation by
the hoe or spade, the soil being of so friable a nature that very
frequently the hand alone is used. The holes are not more than
three inches in depth, and the earth is raised to the same height
above the surface of the ground. When gathered they are placed on
stands, or platforms, raised ten or twelve feet, on which they
are heaped up, and loosely covered with fern. Experience has
shown that the best way to preserve the potatoes is to admit a
free current of air; hence the reason why they are so exposed;
besides which, the rats cannot get at them when in such an
elevated situation: potatoes are seldom sown twice on the same
spot.</p>
<p>Dogs are now seldom eaten, nor does it appear they ever were
an important article of diet. If they go on increasing as they
have done of late, the settlers and missionaries will find it
difficult to secure their sheep from them.</p>
<p>The natives construct their huts with peculiar neatness; and
their mats furnish a convincing proof, that with so much natural
ingenuity, they would soon excel in many manufactures if tutored.
They die the mats with the sap of different plants.</p>
<p>Their canoes are the largest I have seen, some of them being
100 feet in length by 12 or 15 in breadth; the body is formed of
a single tree, but the ends are added, and highly carved or
ornamented.</p>
<p>Most of the villages are placed in situations not easily
accessible to an enemy without his being observed. Kororadica,
off which we anchored in order to be near the watering place, is
an exception, as it extends along the beach, and, except in
front, is surrounded by eminences. Small as the village is, it is
ruled by three chiefs, each of whom reigns over his particular
portion: these possess the place by right of conquest, having
expelled a tribe that now resides farther up the bay, and in a
much better situation.</p>
<p>I learnt but little of their customs * that is not already
known to the generality of readers, and shall therefore only
notice the way in which they dispose of their dead. The body
being put into a box, or coffin, is then secured on a stand, or
on the lower branch of a tree, where it remains until quite
decayed; after which the bones are buried with much ceremony; but
on particular occasions a hut is erected, in which the body is
placed in a sitting posture, with the most valuable property of
the deceased; the ground is then tabooed, so that no native dare
approach it, nor can any foreigner do so with impunity. The
captain of a vessel informed me that he once looked into a hut of
this description, not being aware at the time that a tabooed spot
was held so sacred. There were in it three skeletons, and judging
from the property left with them, he supposed them to be the
remains of persons of some consequence. His curiosity cost him a
disturbance with the natives, and a good sum of money to
boot.</p>
<p class="foot">[* One of the most singular is the following.
They will neither eat nor drink, nor will they permit any one
else to do so, within their habitations: all meals must be taken
outside.]</p>
<p>I was informed also that the body is sometimes elevated to a
certain height from the ground, after which any native who passes
the spot, throws a piece of wood, or a branch, beneath the
corpse.</p>
<p>Of the climate of New Zealand the reports are highly
favourable, and from the concurrent testimony of persons who are
conversant with it, there is every reason to believe they are
correct. Diseases do not seem numerous; of these, consumption is
considered the most fatal, and carries off great numbers of the
youth of both sexes.</p>
<p>There are some excellent harbours in the island, the principal
of which appears to be Southern Port, fifteen miles in length,
but of no great width; the shores are described as rocky and
bold, with here and there a sandy beech.</p>
<p>From a curious map or chart that I possess, delineated by a
native, there must be lakes of no small extent in Eahei No
Mauwee, some of which are connected by streams with the sea; but
one of the largest has no apparent outlet. They contain islands
on which there are fortified villages, and from the number laid
down in all directions, the population of this part of New
Zealand must be considerable. Many of the bays and inlets are
indicated with an accuracy I should not have expected in an
untaught savage, and it is this exactness with respect to the
coast, that induces me to believe he may also be correct, with
regard to the interior. The chart chiefly takes in the Thames, or
Ee How Rackey, and the country to some distance inland, or to the
south-west.</p>
<p>Stewart's Island differs essentially from the other two, and
the sealers who frequent it say it rains there nine months in the
year. Emus and wild dogs are said to have been found upon it, as
also a bird resembling our hen pheasant, but it was unable to
fly. The seal frequents the creeks and bays, "and has been
observed three miles inland," at least so says my informant, who
passed two months there, during which period they killed 300, and
procured from them a large quantity of oil. The timber is not
equal to that on the other islands; the soil is greatly inferior,
and the climate bad.</p>
<p>The New Zealanders are rapidly becoming deteriorated by their
intercourse with Europeans! This is caused principally by a
number of convicts who have escaped from the colonies, and now
reside in the islands; as also by men who have deserted from
vessels, and are little, if at all, better than the convicts. It
may easily be conceived how much immorality must be imbibed from
a set of convicted felons, who are far greater savages than the
islanders themselves, though the last are pagans and cannibals.
Several of these runaways reside at Kororadica, where they
realize money by purchasing spirits from the merchant vessels
that put into the bay, and then retailing them to the crews of
the whalers. One of the most noted of them is a fellow named
Poyner, most likely an assumed name, who has married a native,
and is the father of the good-looking young female to whom I have
alluded.</p>
<p>A New Zealand woman wears two mats, one over the shoulders and
reaching below the waist, and the other secured round the waist
and descending to the feet. To deprive her of the first is looked
upon as a mark of sufficient degradation, but to uncover her
entirely is considered a most humiliating punishment. The above
ruffian tore off, in my presence, the upper mat from his wife,
and then threatened to expose her completely, at the same time
giving her a severe beating. In a place where neither laws nor
regulations exist, it was out of my power to interfere except by
interceding for the unfortunate creature, which, as might have
been expected, was of no, avail. To my great contentment,
although doubtless much against the will of the fellow himself,
he once got a chastisement on board an American vessel that he
will most probably remember for some time to come. He had gone on
board for some purpose, and while there misconducted himself, for
which the captain, previous to turning him out of the ship,
inflicted on him a sound flogging. I honour the American for his
act of summary justice, and wish the commanders of our vessels
would follow so good an example.</p>
<p>With reference to the aversion entertained by the women to
exhibiting their persons, I have seen sketches in which they are
represented in nearly a state of nudity; but while at the Bay of
Islands I did not observe one who was not clothed from the throat
to the feet; that an improper exposure is considered degrading I
had ocular proof in the above instance; besides which, a well
informed person, who had passed some time among them, informed me
that such was actually the case.</p>
<p>The missionaries make sad complaints of the bad conduct of the
men to whom I have alluded, with whom they should commence their
labours instead of which the New Zealanders, as do the few
respectable merchants who are settled at the Bay of Islands; but
they possess no power of preventing them from following evil
inclinations, their authority extending no farther than their own
thresholds. Nor is it believed that the resident or consul (he
had not arrived when I was in the bay) will be able to assist
them unless accompanied by a detachment of soldiers, which, by
all accounts, is not likely to be the case. Yet without some aid
I cannot perceive of what utility his office will be, as his
authority will be rendered altogether nugatory, if he is not
furnished with the means of enforcing coercive measures with the
convicts, etc.; and if troops were sent, I fear it would soon
provoke a fracas with the natives.</p>
<p>By offering to the chiefs a reward of tobacco, powder, or any
article that is prized, they would, in a very short time, capture
and deliver up the whole of the runaways.</p>
<p>It must be confessed that these vagabonds are not the only
cause of the demoralization of the natives, for the crews of the
whalers (there were seven in that bay) conduce almost equally to
effect it, although in a different way. I witnessed on board of
one of their ships a scene which baffle an description, and made
me fancy myself amongst the most riotous of those worthies the
Buccaneers! The number of females (natives) equalled or surpassed
that of the crew; and the sounds of revelry and licentious riot
which pervaded the vessel, would have astounded Morgan, Van
Graff, Van Horn, or any other of the renowned freebooters.</p>
<p>Whalers are ever a lawless race; after the hardships and
privations of a cruise of perhaps four or five months, it is
natural to suppose they must be glad of a little relaxation when
they go into port to refit; but instead of indulging themselves
moderately and rationally, they rush at once into the very vortex
of the most boisterous mirth and dissipation, and the lord of
misrule reigns paramount amongst them. I shall not exceed the
limits of truth in stating, that the infernal orgies of these men
resembled more the unholy mysteries of the ancient worshippers of
Bacchus, than the sober enjoyments of Christians; and the reader
will readily agree with me that such persons are not likely to
improve the morals of a nation of barbarians.</p>
<p>I have not the slightest intention of attempting to make the
reader believe that the crews of the whalers are to be even
compared, in point of moral turpitude, with the convicts, or
whatever they call themselves, of Kororadica, for their faults
are exceeding venial when compared with the crimes of such
villains; but by teaching the New Zealanders to drink, and
encouraging their women to lead a life of infamy, the example
they set is equally pernicious in its effect upon their minds;
with this excuse, if an excuse can be alleged, that the faults of
the sailors are more the result of that hilarity and
thoughtlessness peculiar to those, the principal portion of whose
lives is passed in a constant succession of hardship, and whose
time for pleasure or recreation is necessarily brief; but the
crimes of the convicts are of a far deeper die, and arise from a
settled principle of brutality and baseness, inherent in some,
familiar to all of them: they are men whose minds are sunk to the
lowest grade of vileness.</p>
<p>I was greatly amused with an observation which occurs in a
recent publication, stating that "to the crews of the whalers we
are indebted for having, in a manner, civilized the hardy
islanders!" It is, indeed, "in a manner," but not quite the right
one.</p>
<p>If proper means were adopted to reclaim the New Zealanders, a
point under existing circumstances not very easy to accomplish,
we have no reason to doubt of their becoming eventually a people
of some consideration, as the country possesses advantages which
ought to enable them to hold a respectable situation among the
nations of the earth: it has materials for building ships, a
salubrious climate, a fertile soil, and the coasts swarm with
fish; and, finally, the three islands contain an area of nearly
100,000 square miles, which is more than equal to that of Great
Britain.</p>
<p>Whether the missionaries have conferred a benefit on the
islanders or not, with respect to intellectual attainments, I
will not venture to affirm or deny; there being so many different
sentiments upon this subject, I would rather decline giving an
opinion. They have a neat, and rather pretty little village; and
I understand a good many children are taught to read and write,
which can scarcely be of equal utility with some of the
handicraft trades.</p>
<p>One thing is quite certain, namely, that no adult native has
hitherto been converted, which may possibly arise from the
circumstance of the missionaries "trying," as Kotzebue remarks,
"to make christians of them before they make them <i>men</i>."
More than one New Zealander has demanded a musket, or blanket,
for listening to a missionary, and declined to attend because
refused a reward. This reminds me of the Coobd in Anastasius, who
chose to become a catholic while rice was distributed, but when
the supply ceased, cried out "no pilaff, no pope!"</p>
<p>There are about 150 Europeans in the islands, including
children, (the missionaries in particular have large families),
and some of them have purchased land of the chiefs, with the view
of cultivating flax, and of supplying shipping with provisions,
spars, and plank. It has been supposed that the flax is not
adapted for cordage, as the rope is very liable to unlay, and is
easily broken; but it will be useful for many other purposes:
indeed, many persons are of opinion, that the flax brought to
this country had not been properly prepared, and that it will
eventually be found to answer perfectly well.</p>
<p>In the above brief and desultory observations I have referred
to no work of any kind, for, as I have already stated, it was not
my intention to give a regular description of New Zealand, but
simply to notice it as connected with the Australian Colony.</p>

<p><span class="aa">The</span> aborigines of New Holland are a
singular race, and very different from the savages of the other
South Sea Islands; and as little is known in England of their
habits or customs, the reader may possibly derive some
information from the following observations.</p>
<p>Their hair is not woolly, nor is it always frizzled, for I
have seen it long and straight; the nose is flat, the nostrils
expanded, the lips thick, and mouth wide. They are of good
height, and with the exception of their limbs being somewhat too
slender, they are sufficiently well formed. In some, the
complexion is black as that of the negro; in others it approaches
nearer to that of a mulatto.</p>
<p>As their habits are migratory, so are their habitations
temporary, being constructed of pieces of bark, or branches of
trees, wherewith an oven-shaped hut is made, six or eight feet in
diameter, and of about the same height: in this they repose in a
sitting posture with their knees against the chin.</p>
<p>Natural deformity is very rarely met with, and most of them
retain their teeth, in all their perfection to the last.</p>
<p>Of those on the north-west coast Dampier remarks: "The
inhabitants of this country are the most miserable people in the
world; the Hottentots compared with them are <i>gentlemen</i>!
They have no houses, animals, nor poultry; their persons are
tall, straight bodied, thin, with long limbs; they have great
heads, round foreheads, and great brows; their eyelids are always
half closed to keep the flies out of their eyes, (for they are so
troublesome here that no fanning will keep them from one's face,)
so that, from their infancy, they never open their eyes as some
people do, and therefore they cannot see far unless they hold up
their heads, as if they were looking at something over them. They
have great bottle-noses, full lips, wide mouths; the two
fore-teeth of the upper-jaw are wanting in all of them; neither
have they any beard. Their hair is short, black, and curled; and
their skins coal-black, like that of the negroes in Africa. Their
only food is fish; they consequently search for them at low
water, making little weirs or dams, with stones, across the coves
of the sea. They have neither boats nor canoes!"</p>
<p>This is not a very flattering portrait, but it seems to be
correct; it does not however apply to those in New South Wales,
at least so far as regards the flies.</p>
<p>At Swan River, the natives (they have already been noticed)
are extremely inimical to the Europeans, and have murdered
several persons, besides destroying a greater number of sheep.
When I was there soon, after the formation of the settlement, we
found them friendly and quiet, nor did I hear of a single act of
aggression on their part; the only way therefore of accounting
for the bad feeling which now exists between them and the
settlers, is by supposing they must have been ill-used, or that
some misunderstanding has taken place. Of their customs not much
appeared to be known; one however is singular, as it prevails on
the east coast upwards of 2,000 miles distant. They invariably
destroy an individual of a neighbouring tribe whenever one of
their own tribe has paid the debt of nature! This has been
absurdly attributed to the circumstance of Providence having
decreed the final destruction or extinction of all the people in
this part of New Holland; as if we have any right to suppose
Providence capable of an act of such absolute supererogation as
that of creating a race of human beings merely to destroy them.*
Those I saw were naked, and, some of them, painted; and their
disfiguring themselves by thrusting a bone through the septum of
the nose, and adorning their heads with feathers, is a practice
which I understand prevails along the whole western coast: on the
eastern it is very common.</p>
<p class="foot">[* When any friend of the Pampas Indians dies
before he has reached the natural term of life (which is unusual)
they believe that some enemy has prevailed upon the evil spirit
to kill him, and assemble to determine who this enemy can be.
They then denounce war against the supposed culprit.]</p>
<p>There is no particular difference between the natives of that
part of New Holland south of Swan River on the West, and of Shoal
Haven on the east coast; their arms are much the same, though
there appears some distinction in their tomahawks and knives, if
they can be so termed. These will be noticed in their proper
place.</p>
<p>At Shoal Haven River there occurred, some years since, so
curious an instance of superstition, that it may be worthy of
mention. Three natives persuaded a convict servant to accompany
them in search of cedar, an ornamental and useful wood that is
found in this part of the country. The man, naturally expecting
no treachery was intended, as he, in common with others, had been
accustomed to such expeditions, set off with them without
hesitation&mdash;for the blacks, being much better acquainted
with the localities, save both time and trouble to those who have
occasion to penetrate into the "bush." The guides, watching a
favourable opportunity, pushed him over a precipice, and he was
killed upon the spot. One of them then cut out his tongue, and
ate it, in the supposition that as he had eaten the tongue of a
white man, he would in consequence be enabled to speak English! I
readily grant this is somewhat marvellous; but there is not the
smallest reason to doubt the word of the gentleman who related
the circumstance to me. He added, that the body was subsequently
found, and one of the blacks described the cause and manner of
the murder.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** According to Marco Polo the Tartars had a
custom, that when a stranger of good appearance happened to lodge
with them, they used to kill him in the night, believing that the
good qualities of the murdered person would afterwards devolve to
the inhabitants of the house!<br>
<br>
It is, I suppose, to this custom that Butler alludes when he
says</p>
<p class="poem">"A wild Tartar, when he spies<br>
A man that's handsome, valiant, wise;<br>
If he can kill him, thinks t'inherit<br>
His wit, his beauty, and his spirit."]</p>
<p>At certain times of the year, numerous blacks are seen at and
in the neighbourhood of Sydney, who are the most wretched in
appearance of any I have met with; nor will this excite surprise,
when it is considered that they learn to drink, and also to
become idle, depending entirely upon the charity of the whites
for food, and neglecting during their stay among them, all those
active habits to which they have been accustomed. These people
are never permitted to enter the town unless clothed.</p>
<p>During my excursion to Lake George, I saw very few natives;
there was no marked distinction between them and those scattered
over the other parts of the colony.</p>
<p>Every one must be aware that savages, when depending upon the
chase for subsistence, sometimes suffer greatly from famine, and
in consequence do not hesitate to destroy their newborn children;
but this is an act of necessity, and if done by the New
Hollanders, is done by them in common with others. I was told
that the natives about Lake George were in the habit of having
recourse to this horrible practice. They have also a custom so
extraordinary that I should have hesitated to mention it, if it
had not been related to me by a gentleman well acquainted with
them. He said he had <i>seen</i> them bleed themselves with a bit
of flint or a shell, and allow the blood to flow into a sort of
dish made of bark; the latter was then placed upon the warm
embers, until its contents were somewhat dried: the blood was
then eaten! If this was not borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, I
know not what is. May not this strange practice be some
superstitious ceremony?</p>
<p>I heard also that the native women, both in this part of the
colony, and elsewhere, sometimes put their children to death, in
order that they may be enabled to suckle the whelps of the dogs,
by which they are invariably accompanied. This idea is so
monstrous that I do not believe it; but that they do frequently
suckle the whelps is well known to be the case.</p>
<p>Near Bathurst I fell in with from 100 to 200 natives, who
appeared to be on excellent terms with the colonists; but some
serious disturbances had taken place a few years before, when
many of them were killed. Discovering afterwards that it was in
vain to contend with their antagonists they became quiet, and
have remained so ever since.</p>
<p>The following is a specimen of their native language, and my
reason for inserting it is, its being the best specimen of a
native idiom that I was able to procure. The words are spelt as
nearly as possible according to the pronunciation&mdash;</p>

<p>While in the Bathurst country, I witnessed a Corrobborey, or
meeting between two hostile parties,* and for some time
entertained an idea that they were only amusing themselves; in
fact, after all their trouble, it was not very evident which
party got the best, though it was quite so that two individuals
got the worst of it, one of them having his head broken, and the
other his leg.</p>
<p class="foot">[* A Corrobborey, however, does not always imply
a <i>hostile</i> meeting.]</p>
<p>The disputants afterwards separated, and returned to their
respective districts, with as much unconcern (the wounded of
course excepted) as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>If thickness of skull would enable a person to bear a large
quantity of liquor, these aborigines might out-do the toper of
yore, who directed that it might be inscribed upon his tomb what
an enormous portion of wine he could swallow; but the maudlin
native of New Holland becomes intoxicated by a vulgar beverage
made in the most simple manner possible. A bag, in which sugar
has been imported from the Mauritius, and made of the leaves of a
particular kind of tree that grows in the island, is steeped in
water, by which means all the saccharine matter is extracted,
forming a decoction of sugar, (there is no reason for supposing
the bag itself has any effect on the beverage,) and with this
simple drink the native soon becomes in that state in which men
like to be who love their wine.</p>
<p>This however general it may be at and about Sydney, is not so
throughout the colony; for I neither saw, nor heard, that the
natives at Lake George, Bathurst, and in other parts of the
interior, were addicted to inebriation. This may possibly arise
from their not having the opportunity, as I have never met with
an uncivilized people who would not indulge, if any intoxicating
drink were placed in their way.</p>
<p>It was during my rambles from the Wollombi to Liverpool Plains
that I saw more of the natives than in all my excursions; and
certainly what I did see of them by no means inspired me with a
very high opinion of their intellect or general habits. Speaking
of them collectively, it must be confessed I entertain very
little more respect for the aborigines of New Holland, than for
the ourang-outang; in fact, I can discover no great difference.
In comparing them, however, with this animal, I make the
similitude only in so far as their general habits are considered;
and in selecting the <i>Simia Troglodytes</i>, I cannot think an
injustice is done them; at least if we are to believe Buffon, who
affirms that he saw one so trained, or rather educated (which, as
far as my recollection carries me, was his expression), that he
would use a knife and fork, or napkin; take wine with a person,
and, when invited to take tea, would bring a cup and saucer, put
in sugar, pour out the tea, and allow it to cool before he drank
it; in short, he is stated to have conducted himself at table
with as much propriety as any individual of the genus
<i>Homo!</i> If this be true, it would certainly have put to the
blush the whole race of New Hollanders, for he says (Buffon, not
the ourang-outang) that the above mentioned individual was
likewise very cleanly in its habits. Now those of the natives of
this country are filthy beyond conception, especially in their
mode of eating. They take, for example, an opossum, deprive the
creature of its fur, and then, when just warmed over a fire, tear
it to pieces and devour it, in very nearly a raw state, giving
the entrails to their wives. There is something peculiarly
disgusting in observing them while eating, nevertheless I could
not refrain from laughing when I thought of the contrast between
them, and a fat citizen while swallowing his turtle. The
ourang-outang is represented to be of a grave appearance, and
melancholy disposition, disinclined to frolic even when young.
This is not exactly the case with the New Hollanders; but the
former is certainly a "mere animal," and Lord Monboddo says that
man in "a state of nature" is nothing more! The comparison,
therefore, between <i>Homo</i> and <i>Simia</i> is, in this
instance, clearly in favour of the former.</p>
<p>We found the Wollombi natives very friendly towards us, but
they seemed to have taken a much greater liking to some swine
belonging to the gentlemen with whom I was staying; of these they
slew several, and were bearing them off in triumph, when to their
extreme dissatisfaction, not to say dismay, the superintendant
made all possible haste in pursuit with his establishment of
dogs. One of these sable stealers of pork was driven into a tree,
and another was fairly run down and brought to bay, crying out
all the time in a most unbecoming manner; an evident proof that
he did not belong to the sect of the stoics. The superintendant
took great care that the dogs did them no injury, his object
being only to frighten the depredators; and, having recaptured
his pigs and secured the <i>spolia opina</i> in the shape of two
spears, he wisely retired; his retreat being perhaps accelerated
by the warlike appearance of the tribe, who began to brandish
their arms, and to show symptoms of a sudden enlargement of their
"organs of destructiveness."</p>
<p>A neighbouring tribe killed, in 1830, more than 100 sheep
belonging to a settler who has a farm near Wollombi; they then
bound the shepherd hand and foot, left him upon an ant's nest (a
bed that Guatimozin himself would not have envied him), and then
departed. The man was rescued before he had sustained any injury,
and most fortunately for him, for these ants sting and bite in a
way that would astonish any one, as I know from experience,
having twice suffered from their attacks, to my great annoyance,
for many days afterwards. The large black ant can cause a pain
inmost as acute as that of a wasp! A party of soldiers, or
dismounted police, were sent after the offenders, of whom they
killed several.</p>
<p>In case of any serious affray with the blacks, it really would
appear to be the most judicious plan, to make upon them at once,
a strong impression; for if only one or two be killed, the sole
effect is to instigate them to revenge their companions, whereby
a series of murders on both sides is the consequence! At the same
time <i>actual necessity</i> alone can justify the destruction of
these poor creatures; nor should the trifling circumstance of
stealing a pig, or a sheep, be admitted as an excuse. But on the
other hand, they should not be permitted to harrass the settlers
with impunity: we have taken possession of their country, and are
determined to keep it; if, therefore, they destroy the settlers
or their property, they must expect that the law of retaliation
will be put in force, and that reprisals will be committed upon
themselves. This has rarely been the case, as they have been
<i>wantonly</i> butchered; and some of the Christian (?) whites
consider it a pastime to go out and shoot them. I questioned a
person from Port Stephens concerning the disputes with the
aborigines of that part of the colony, and asked him, if he, or
any of his companions, had ever come into collision with them, as
I had heard there prevailed much enmity between the latter and
the people belonging to the establishment? His answer was, "Oh we
used to shoot them like fun!" It would have been a satisfaction
to have seen such a heartless ruffian in an archery ground with
about a score of expert archers at a fair distance from him, if
only to witness how well he would personify the representations
of St. Sebastian. This man was a shrewd mechanic, and had been
some years at Port Stephens: if such people consider the life of
a black of so little value, how is it to be wondered at, if the
convicts entertain the same opinion? It is to be hoped that the
practice of shooting them is at an end, but they are still
subjected to annoyance from the stock-keepers, who take their
women and do them various injuries besides.</p>
<p>Some of the customs of those near the Wollombi are brutal in
the most extensive sense of the word! One of their dances
commenced by great adorning of their heads with feathers, etc.,
after which they formed a circle round four women, and then began
dancing. The women were on their knees, and threw their heads
about as if knocking them against the ground; at intervals they
threw up their heels, like an animal when kicking, the whole
party, at the same time, yelling in concert in the most hideous
manner imaginable, and with as much regularity as if a master had
been at hand to direct them. After this had continued some time,
the women raised themselves on their hands and feet, the men
still dancing round them, and accompanying their movements by the
most libidinous gestures! The remainder of the dance was far too
disgusting to bear a description. Few of the feelings, which are
so commonly shown by other nations towards their kindred, seem to
exist among these savages: fathers and sons frequently fight and
the latter often deprive the former of their gins,* (not their
own mothers,) and other property. All the tribes procure their
wives by treachery, and always from some other tribe: on these
occasions the unhappy woman is often most dreadfully beaten.</p>
<p class="foot">[* These are not the gin, jin, or genii of the
Mahometans, but the wives of the New Hollanders.]</p>
<p>Amongst many superstitious notions is a great dislike to being
called by the same name as a person who is dead; nor do they even
like to hear the name of a dead man mentioned, as they believe he
will rise and lay hold of them: they have moreover no taste for
graves, not liking at all to approach one, particularly at
night!</p>
<p>In an affray that took place on the Wollombi between two
tribes, four men and two women of the Comleroy tribe were slain;
they were buried at a very pretty spot in the following manner.
The bodies of the men were placed on their backs in the form of a
cross, head to head, each bound to a pole by bandages round the
neck, middle, knees, and ancles, the pole being behind the body;
the two women had their knees bent up and tied to the neck, while
their hands were bound to their knees; they were then placed so
as to have their faces downwards: in fact, they were literally
packed up in two heaps of earth, each of the form of a cone,
about three feet high, and rather removed from the cross; for
their idea of the inferiority of the women will not allow them to
be interred with the men. The neatness and precision observed
with respect to the cross and cones is very remarkable, both
being raised to the same height and so smoothly raked down, that
it would puzzle the nicest observer to discover the slightest
inequality in the form. The trees for some distance around, to
the height of fifteen or twenty feet, are carved over with
grotesque figured meant to represent kangaroos, emus, opossums,
snakes, etc., with rude representations also of the different
weapons they use. Round the cross they made a circle, about
thirty feet in diameter, from which all rubbish was carefully
removed, another was made outside the first, so as to leave a
narrow interval between them: within this interval were laid
pieces of bark, each piece touching the rest, in the same way
that tiles do. The devil, they say, will not leap over the bark,
and cannot walk under it!</p>
<p>Such evident pains and labour to make a place of sepulture,
struck me as being not a little extraordinary in a people so very
indifferent about most other matters; but I could discover no
satisfactory reason why such care had been taken of these members
of their tribe. They said it was the way in which they usually
buried their dead, but this practice is by no means common. Four
waddies (clubs) were stuck into the earth in the centre of the
cross; and these they informed me were left in order that the
deceased might have some arms, "when they jump again," so as to
be enabled to drive away the devil, and prevent him from taking
them again into the earth!</p>
<p>It would appear from this that they have some idea of a future
state; but it is difficult to believe all that is said by those
who have conversed with them respecting this point. Several
creditable persons have informed me that the natives imagine they
will be happier in a future state than at present, as they are to
"jump up" white men, and to possess all the comforts which they
see us enjoy, with plenty to eat and drink, and eternal sunshine
to keep them warm! If this be true, their theological ideas must
be of recent formation, or have experienced some sudden
change.</p>
<p>I have somewhere read of four convicts who escaped from Sydney
in 1790, and were found four or five years afterwards at Port
Stephens, having lived in the interim with the aborigines. The
account stated that the convicts spoke in high terms of their
pacific and gentle manners.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that these people believed the whites were
some of their ancestors who had fallen in battle, and returned
from the sea to revisit them; in consequence of this they held
them in high respect.</p>
<p>One native was convinced that he had identified his father in
the person of one of the runaways, and conducted the man to the
spot where the body of his parent had been burnt.</p>
<p>When informed that great numbers of people existed in other
parts of the world, they said they must be the spirits of their
countrymen, which, after death, had migrated to other climes.</p>
<p>Having once asked a "wild man" why they so much dreaded the
devil&mdash;devil (as they term him) and the place to which he
would convey them? His answer was&mdash;"Because he would carry
them to a very cold place, where they would never see the sun,
and be detained in a state of hunger and cold, from whence there
would be no release." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** Mahomet also taught that the wicked, when in
hell, would be tormented by intense heat and extreme cold.]</p>
<p>If they really acknowledge a Supreme Being, a point never
ascertained, it is not unlikely they may entertain notions
concerning him similar to those prevalent among the negroes on
the coast of Africa, who do not fear the Almighty, because, being
perfectly good, and from his nature beneficent, he is by
consequence averse to inflict an injury; but are in no little
dread of the devil, as they believe him to be naturally
malevolent, and inclined to harm them. For this reason they think
it requisite to propitiate him by sacrifices. A multitude of
instances might be adduced of the awe in which uncivilized
nations stand of the devil; the following, however, will
suffice:&mdash;The Hottentots offered sacrifice to a malignant
deity in order to soften his temper, or assuage his wrath; but
not to the good, as they are of opinion he never does mischief.
In the Friendly Islands the natives try more to conciliate the
evil genius, as he is supposed to inflict diseases. Some of the
Kurds, or Koords, likewise worship Satan (or the evil principle).
The Americans were persuaded that their good deities, prompted by
the natural benevolence of their nature, would bestow every
blessing in their power without solicitation or acknowledgement,
and their only anxiety was to soothe and deprecate the anger of
the powers whom they regarded as the enemies of mankind. The New
Zealanders, too, dread an evil being, without concerning
themselves about a beneficent deity.</p>
<p>Even Luther himself, not possessing the boldness of the saint
of yore, feared his infernal majesty, and thought he caused
thunder! Of whatever description the superstitions of the New
Hollanders may be, they can hardly be more contemptible than
those of other nations.</p>
<p>The women have nothing very irresistible either in their
aspect or appearance; those with whom I met being far inferior to
the young Africans. Nor have they yet adopted the ingenious
method of carrying their children so commonly employed in Africa.
I allude to the use of the kankey, a bundle secured behind, and
beneath the garment; upon this sits the infant, with its arms
round the mother. When the seat is vacant, although somewhat
considerable in its dimensions, and perhaps rather
ultra-fashionable, it strongly reminds one of a certain addition
to the costume of our modern belles, which shall be nameless, but
which will readily occur to the reader. Indeed, there can be
little doubt that the European fair have adopted the suggestion
from their dark-visaged sisters; and we may expect, ere long, to
see our countrywomen combine the useful with the ornamental, and
our rising generation taking the air <i>à la kankey!</i> The only
ornament that I procured was a string of kangaroo teeth worn
round the head, these people resembling in this respect the
Natives of Fernando Po, in which magnificent island the men pay
more attention to the embellishment of their sable bodies than
the women. This is not the only particular in which they resemble
the islanders; their mode of painting themselves is similar. At
Fernando Po several kinds of clay were used, some of the men
having their eyebrows painted white, the cheeks yellow, the upper
lip red; many were striped from head to foot, some before, others
behind, and a most hideous effect it had. Now although the colour
used by the Wollombi tribes was principally white alone, they
were painted much after the same manner. Their spears, too, were
made exactly like some I brought from the African island. The
most striking similarity between them is, that both employ the
same monstrous plan of disfiguring the body by frightful vesicles
and scars.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* A practice common also among the Eboe people
of Western Africa.]</p>
<p>The blacks of Gammon Plains wear short beards, which seems an
arbitrary custom, some wearing them, and others plucking out the
hair by the roots. The men and children generally go quite naked;
and such is the case with most of the New Hollanders; their
women, however usually have kangaroo or opossum skins thrown
loosely about them, as have also the men in cold weather; indeed,
they sometimes make kangaroo cloaks with no little neatness.</p>
<p>When about to fight, the contending parties, except where
treachery is employed (which I believe does not very often
occur), encamp opposite each other. At the dawn of the following
day two young men, one from each side, advance in front of their
respective friends, and, after using the most opprobrious
epithets to each other, mutually throw a spear, and then retire
to procure others, which are thrown in the same manner. If
neither is wounded, they then commence a battle with the club,
using sometimes an elaman, or shield, made of wood; while the
women, particularly those advanced in years, who are probably
more crabbed than the younger ones, excite them to the utmost.
When one is worsted, another advances to succour him, and others
to aid his adversary, until a general <i>mélée</i> takes place,
and broken heads, and sometimes bad spear wounds, are the result;
but the latter do not occur so often as might be expected. The
conquered are allowed to depart without molestation; and they
will even frequently join the victors, so that a person would not
know that there had been any animosity between them. There is
certainly more talking than fighting in their battles, and it is,
therefore, to be hoped they will some day send over a few of
their people as missionaries, to convince <i>civilized</i>
nations that it is far worse to cut the throat of a man while
alive, than to eat his body when dead!</p>
<p>I was greatly disappointed at not falling in with a tribe on
Liverpool Plains; the stock-keepers informed me that they had
gone to war against the Never-never-blacks, who are so called
because they have hitherto kept aloof from the whites.</p>
<p>The natives on the Hunter resemble their neighbours in every
respect. In common with all those tribes with which we are
acquainted, they make excellent guides, when well treated; but
when hard pressed, which is sometimes the fact, when accompanying
persons on horseback, who forget that a horse at a good walk goes
much faster than is convenient for a man on foot, they turn
sulky, and avail themselves of the first opportunity to give
their employers the slip.</p>
<p>On my arrival at Newcastle a tribe had just come in from
punishing a man for some crime; this is done by throwing a
certain number of spears at him, which he wards off, if he can,
with his shield; should he fail, he is pretty certain of
receiving an ugly wound or two.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** In Africa, Bosman saw a negro punished in a
similar manner.]</p>
<p>Of tattooing I met with very little, but frequently observed
the skin much scarred, and also raised in blisters or
vesicles.</p>
<p>The natives of Moreton Bay, although of the same race as those
near Sydney, differ in language, and in many of their customs,
especially in not being, as it is termed, <i>civilized</i>; in
other words, they have not yet picked up a little bad English,
learnt to get drunk, smoke tobacco, or any of the vices so
prevalent among the whites. (This definition of civilization will
apply equally to the New Zealanders.)</p>
<p>It has been asserted that it is unsafe to go among them; they
have certainly murdered an officer and several other persons; but
if the real truth were known, it would, in all probability, be
found that the blacks here, like those in other parts of the
world, have been the injured party, and simply retaliated upon
their persecutors some of the numberless wrongs experienced at
their hands.</p>
<p>In point of appearance these people are greatly superior to
those in the neighbourhood of the capital, being more robust,
manly, as well as healthy looking; in respect, however, to the
expression of their countenances, they do not surpass the other
New Hollanders. They all go without clothing. The men of each
tribe are tattooed in a peculiar manner; this, in some instances,
is neatly enough executed; in others it consists solely in making
a number of horrid scars, or raising the skin in blisters.</p>
<p>The tribes commonly consist of from thirty to fifty men, women
and children, each having its own particular boundaries, which
are seldom passed, except at the "corroberies," held about the
period of the fall moon. At this time several collect together,
not unlikely from superstitious motives, though principally for
the purposes of amusement. The meeting at an end, they return to
their respective hunting or fishing grounds, to pass which, at
any other time, is considered an act of aggression, or a signal
for war.</p>
<p>Those bush-rangers, who have lived longest with them, say
their wars are of rare occurrence, short duration, seldom
attended with loss of life, and, for the most part, mere sudden
ebullitions of passion, evaporating in empty threats; or, at
most, a few spears are thrown, and some of their adversaries
wounded. Both parties then find it convenient to return to their
respective territories, and think no more of the matter. Although
each tribe is limited to its peculiar district, within that tract
of country they are far from confining themselves to one spot,
as, independent of being compelled to move from one place to
another in order to obtain subsistance, a settled residence does
not suit their disposition.</p>
<p>Their grounds usually include a square of twenty or thirty
miles, within which they change their stations according as the
season may answer for catching fish at the different places;
their food also consists of kangaroos, opossums, guanas, snakes
and a species of worm.</p>
<p>While the natives on the coast subsist chiefly on fish, those
in the interior are more expert at catching the various animals
of the forest; but the root of the fern, called Bungwhaul, is
eaten by them generally.</p>
<p>The mode employed by the New Zealanders to prepare it is the
following; the fern, being first roasted, is beaten on a stone
with a piece of wood, until soft like dough; when cold again, it
attains the solidity of gingerbread. The Moreton Bay blacks have
most probably adopted the same method.</p>
<p>The task of procuring and preparing the Bungwhaul devolves
entirely upon the women, who also make all the nets, and are
loaded during their journies, with children, bark for their huts
or canoes, and even dogs, while the men walk along, with all the
consequence imaginable, at most with a spear or fishing-net in
their hand. This is not the only hardship the poor women endure,
for their ungallant lords are extremely passionate, and often
beat and cut them in a most shocking manner.</p>
<p>When on the move, if they do not intend to remain beyond a day
or two at a place, they have no covering save the canopy of
heaven; but when at a good fishing station, where their stay is
likely to be prolonged, a sort of hut is constructed with small
branches, or the bark of trees, which will keep out the rain: a
fire is then lighted in front, so that the inmates contrive to
keep themselves tolerably warm.</p>
<p>Sixty or seventy miles to the northward of the bay, their huts
are far superior to those met with elsewhere in this colony, the
customs changing, in some respects, even in that short distance.
As a proof of this, all the runaway convicts who have been there,
declare positively that the natives are cannibals; now they are
decidedly not so immediately around this settlement, nor to the
southward of it. One of the most curious of their customs is that
of preserving the bones, skin, or other parts of their deceased
friends, which they frequently carry about with them. One officer
procured a complete skin, and another a child's foot in perfect
preservation.</p>
<p>On the arrival of Europeans in this part of New Holland, the
natives were acknowledged to be a harmless, inoffensive race of
people, and for the first two or three years they continued on
the best terms with the colonists. Subsequently, however,
quarrels arose through their ignorance of our laws relative to
the right of property; for having been taught to eat com, to
which they soon become extremely partial, they shortly began to
take it without waiting for permission, doubtless concluding
there was no harm in doing so. Hence arose a succession of
disputes, which furnished those employed to watch the corn, with
a pretext for shooting them. Of this the government appears to
have been ignorant, as was also Captain L&mdash;, whom they
murdered.</p>
<p>A most convincing proof of their not being naturally inimical
to those by whom they are not maltreated, is the fact, that
convicts who have escaped and lived among them, except in having
their clothes taken away, experienced great kindness.</p>
<p>Our astonishment and indignation are excited when these
unhappy people now and then put to death an unarmed white who may
chance to fall in their way, because we do not reflect that they
act according to their own sense of right and wrong. Can it be
supposed they will submit to the atrocious treatment they meet
with at the hands of the soldiers, constables looking for
bush-rangers, persons going up and down the river in boats, and
convicts, without indulging in some measure that feeling, so
strongly implanted in the human mind, which prompts the oppressed
to turn upon the oppressors, and avenge upon them some of the
multiplied evils by which their already sufficiently wretched
existence has been embittered?</p>
<p>It would be absurd to imagine they will; and so long as we
persist in annoying them, so long may we expect them to avail
themselves of every opportunity to requite the iniquitous conduct
of those by whom they are injured.</p>
<p>The reader may easily conceive what kind of usage they must
experience from doubly convicted felons,* when persons of
comparative respectability can fire at them for their diversion,
and feel gratified with their day's amusement; and when instead
of giving them a piece of bread, a few potatoes, or a little
sugar and water, for their hatchets, efc., they take them by
force, justifying themselves with the plea that the owners are
only blacks.</p>
<p class="foot">[* He will recollect that Moreton Bay is a penal
settlement.]</p>
<p>Upon one occasion all the dogs were set at them, not on
account of any act of violence on their part, but because a
tribe, a hundred miles from the settlement, had murdered a
soldier.</p>
<p>It was in consequence of all this that during two years they
were never seen in the neighbourhood, unless accidentally, that
is to say the tribes previously on friendly footing with the
colonists; but those in the interior were inclined to be
sufficiently familiar, and, it must be admitted, were at times
both annoying and troublesome.</p>
<p>Not long since, when Captain C&mdash; was nearly a hundred
miles to the northward, he gave the natives all kinds of
presents, notwithstanding which they ran off, during his absence
from the tent, with an axe. They are certainly great thieves, and
will often steal blankets, and other articles under similar
circumstances.</p>
<p>The tribe of that tract of country, where the pilot resides,
once burnt his house, besides killing a soldier and a convict,
independently of their having attacked people by throwing spears
at them, for which it is not very evident they had any adequate
cause; but it is so easy matter to determine this point, as only
one side of the story is heard. If the aborigines were able to
tell theirs, it would not improbably be very different. There is
often great difficulty in acting justly towards them, protecting
at the same time the lives or property of the whites, it being
impossible to discover those who commit depredations, if once
permitted to escape; unless therefore by firing at the instant,
there is no way of punishing them.</p>
<p>During the time they were at variance with our people, no one
could with safety go unarmed where there was a liability of
falling in with them; but there was no instance of their offering
any resistance of consequence to a person when armed. An officer
frightened a whole tribe by presenting a bottle; and it is
believed that two men with muskets would beat off all the natives
in this part of the country.</p>
<p>Through the judicious and humane conduct of the present
commandant a reconciliation was effected, and the "wild men" are
once more on the best terms with the colonists. The tribes with
which they have most communication is that in the immediate
vicinity of Moreton Bay, and another residing chiefly upon the
islands in it, and on the coast where the pilot lives. The former
are almost constantly at the agricultural establishment, where
they pass most of their time among the soldiers, who give them
sweet potatoes in return for squirrels, parrots, etc., etc., and
they occasionally receive tomahawks for catching convicts. As
they find it their interest to proceed in this way, and as any
one who ill-uses them is certain to be punished, we may look for
a continuance of the friendly feeling which now exists.</p>
<p>With the exception of the animals indigenous to their country,
they will not touch animal food, nor will they taste spirits; but
they are fond of maize, sweet potatoes, sugar and water, and
bread. The last they call "Five Island," because three
shipwrecked sailors who were driven on shore in a boat gave them
some biscuit and asked them the way to Five Islands or
Illawarra.</p>
<p>They greatly prize an iron tomahawk, or a blanket, though they
apparently make little use of the latter, if one may judge from
their stealing a cloak and tearing the red lining into strips
with which they adorn their heads.</p>
<p>They also like to have their hair cut and beards shaved by an
European, as they perform the operation themselves with a burning
sticky an article carded with them on all their journies, it
being a tedious affair to obtain fire if once extinguished, for
they are then compelled to rub two sticks together until they
ignite.</p>
<p>Amongst their customs is that of changing names with any
person with whom they wish to become particularly friendly;
therefore there are numerous English names among a people who
will not speak a word of English! A soldier of the 57th regiment
exchanged names with the leading man: in the tribe, and called
himself the Duke of York; the native retains the appellation, and
will continue to do so until he meets with a new friend, when
another exchange will take place.</p>
<p>I believe it has been said of all the New Hollanders, that
they have no kind of religion. The remark is certainly applicable
to those of Moreton Bay; but they are not the less addicted to
superstition, believing as they do that some of the whites are
their dead friends returned in that shape, and showing them,
accordingly, the greatest kindness and attention. Indeed,
wretched as they are, they appear to have some attachments; for
when Capt. C. came suddenly upon their women, he never knew them
attempt to escape by leaving their children. Although they
expected to be murdered or made prisoners, they would run with a
child on each shoulder, holding by the mother's hair, and
apparently quite secure, although she had no hold of either. This
opinion by no means nullifies my previous observation when
speaking of the Wollombi tribes, and commenting on the absence
among them of feelings of regard for their immediate kindred,
although applied generally to the New Hollanders. Women are not
the criterions by which we can judge of the sentiments of a
people or nation; for every person must be well aware that they
invariably display far greater tenderness, especially in regard
to their offspring, than men.</p>
<p>While many of the aborigines have several wives, others have
only one; this, perhaps, arises from their possessing less
influence, or not being leading men. Their women may be
considered a species of property, as they perform various menial
offices already noticed. The language spoken here is very
different from that of the tribes near the capital, and appears
to have very few words, the same term being applied to a tree,
mast, oar, stick, or any piece of wood; there is also only one
word to denote a man when sick or dead, the different
signification depending upon the pronunciation.</p>
<p>If they receive a piece of glass it is divided, each breaking
his portion into very small fragments; these, after the sharp
corners have been rubbed off, are swallowed, while the blacks
place themselves in a variety of odd postures, use many strange
gestures, look up to heaven, and remark how good it is!</p>
<p>In common with all savages, they possess a good deal of
cunning, and very little, if any, care for the future. Their rude
canoe, for instance, which costs them some trouble in the
construction, when it has conveyed them where they wish to go, is
constantly left to be beaten to pieces on the beach; although by
being pulled up a few yards it would be placed in security, and
ready when required at any subsequent time.</p>
<p>In addition to carrying about portions of their departed
friends, they sometimes assemble to dance at their graves:
moreover, in common with the Wollombi blacks, they never mention
the name of a person deceased; and an individual of one of the
tribes, who was called commandant, having died, they now
designate the commanding officer by another appellation like all
the aborigines of New Holland, they are great mimics; and so
expert are they at making signs, that, even without comprehending
a word of their language, it is scarcely possible to mistake
their meaning.</p>
<p>For the whole of the information concerning the natives of the
Moreton Bay districts, I have to thank Capt. Clunie, of the 17th
regiment, from whose interesting letters to his colonel I was
permitted to extract whatever matter I deemed necessary.</p>
<p>The circumstance of their supposing some of the whites to be
their deceased friends returned to life, is worthy of
observation; for if the Wollombi tribes really believe
<i>they</i> will "jump up white men&mdash;" and certainly this
was positively asserted to be the fact,&mdash;it would shew an
intercourse between distant tribes that we could hardly have
expected, the distance being not less perhaps than 450 miles!</p>
<p>At Port Macquarrie the natives differ in some respects from
those in the other parts of the colony; but in the main there
exists no very essential distinction, their general habits being
much the same. In the interior they are described as very wild
and savage. However, I doubt if much is known concerning them:
those near the settlement are on very good terms with the
colonists.</p>
<p>The Cowarrwel blacks, whose territories are near the mountains
to the westward of Port Macquarrie, have a peculiar mode of
acting with regard to their dead; for, instead of interring them
in the usual way, they sew the body in bark procured from the
tea-tree, which resembles that of the birch, but is softer and
much thicker, the layers being far more numerous, and then
suspend it from a tree at the height of ten feet from the ground,
and close to one of their paths. Each black, in passing, throws a
piece of wood beneath the corpse, in the same manner as is
observed in New Zealand, and the body is burnt as soon as the
pile is large enough. This is a curious circumstance, for, in
other respects, no two people can differ more.</p>
<p>On the coast the dead are buried in shallow graves, which are
so levelled as not to be visible; and all the grass immediately
around is carefully rooted up, though why is not clearly
understood. In some parts of Australia, the aborigines dig a
grave in the usual form, and then excavate a hole in one side of
it, into which the corpse is thrust. The grave itself is then
filled with stones and earth, which are well beaten down. This
practice is common among the Korannas in Africa, and likewise in
Sumatra.</p>
<p>When a native dies, the body is turned over in all directions;
an old man then stoops down, and asks the defunct by whom he was
killed? The latter being incapable of answering for himself, the
hoary knave answers for him, and, pretending that he has his
information from the dead man, is sure to mention a person
belonging to another tribe. The consequence is a war, when great
exertions are made by the friends of the deceased to slay the
supposed murderer: This would appear to be precisely the custom
which prevails on the west coast, for after all it amounts to the
same thing&mdash;that is to say, when a man dies, one of another
tribe must be slain. Has Providence decreed the extinction of the
<i>aborigines</i> on <i>both</i> coasts?</p>
<p>At Port Macquarrie, as elsewhere, fathers fight against their
sons, and the latter against their parents; they are also
vindictive and treacherous, and never pardon an injury. A man
never marries a woman of his own tribe; but that he is obliged to
fight for that tribe into which he marries, is, I am convinced, a
mistake.</p>
<p>Pugnacity seems to be a prevailing vice throughout this
extensive island, for go where you will&mdash;north, south, east,
west&mdash;nothing is heard of but wars; and it is fortunate that
these are not so bloody as in Christian and civilized regions,
for if this were the case, New Holland would soon be peopled only
by whites. Whether, after a victory, they sing a Te Deum or an Io
Pæan, I omitted to inquire; in all probability they remain
contented with having gained the battle, without wishing to make
the higher powers a party in their squabbles.</p>
<p>In some parts of New South Wales they are very careless
respecting their sick, and those unable to accompany them on
their expeditions. At Port Macquarrie, though at first
sufficiently attentive, if the malady be of such a nature that
the cure of it is protracted, the sufferers are soon neglected,
and often deserted. They are very jealous of their women, and yet
(which, by the way, appears a contradiction) will lend them for a
bit of bread or some tobacco; but the price must be paid in
advance, as they have so often been deceived by the christian
savages, that they have now become too cunning to trust them.</p>
<p>In the event of one of their women having a child by a white,
it is, if a female, preserved; but if a male, it is put to death
without mercy. An anecdote upon this subject was related to me,
which tends to prove that this does not arise so much from any
inherent principle of inhumanity, as from the idea they
entertain, that the offspring of a European "will know too much!"
An idea analogous to this prevails amongst some of the people of
the Kroo Country, at Cape Palmas; for if a man, while absent at
Sierra Leone, or on board a vessel, has learnt to read, he is
certain of being poisoned by the priests on his return, as they
fear that, with so much knowledge, he will become too great a man
among them! Such, too, may be the opinion of the New Hollanders.
At Port Macquarrie the blacks eat of every living creature, even
the native dog&mdash;an animal, in so far as I could ascertain,
generally rejected by the other tribes; but they will not eat a
snake unless killed by themselves, as they fancy it may have
bitten itself, and thereby become poisonous. This feeling is very
prevalent in the colony, most of the natives refusing to eat a
snake under similar circumstances. Their food is almost always
eaten in nearly a raw state, as they say that, if too much done,
it would become dry like a waddie.</p>
<p>There is a remarkable ceremony performed, not only in this
neighbourhood, but, with some variation, in many parts of New
Holland: here it is called kabarrah, and is performed in the
following manner:&mdash;The summit of an eminence, or low hill,
is chosen for the scene of this singular rite; the surface is
then carefully cleaned from grass, etc., and the bark of any
trees that may be near is carved into rude representations of
different animals. After this a fire is lighted in the centre,
and the youth who is to be initiated is suspended or held by the
heels, while the natives dance round him, uttering loud shouts. A
man called the Cragee, or doctor, then <i>bites</i> out the upper
front-tooth on the left side, or, if he should fail, it is
knocked out. It is not unlikely that the tooth is loosened
beforehand, as otherwise the Cragee might be liable to break one
of his own teeth instead of that of the lad. After the extraction
of the tooth, the youth is supposed to have arrived at the age of
manhood, and is then at liberty to steal a woman from another
tribe.</p>
<p>No female is permitted to be present at the celebration of
these rites, nor may she even approach within several hundred
yards of the spot; and any attempt on the part of one to witness
the ceremony would be punished by instant death.* The kabarrah
always includes several tribes, some of whom come from a distance
of eighty or a hundred miles, and probably much farther. As a
preliminary to the meeting, two messengers are despatched from
each tribe (intending to be present,) and these men, together
with the leading men of the Port Macquarrie natives, form a
council, by whose authority wars are proclaimed, boundaries
settled, and one tribe prevented from interfering with, or
encroaching upon another; so that it is natural to suppose that
this part of the country is of no small consideration. It is also
not unlikely that the tribe may be one of some consequence;
otherwise, the natives of the Corborn Comleroy would scarcely
travel so far merely to be present at the meeting. While it
lasts, all the blacks of the respective districts are on the most
friendly terms; but as soon as it is concluded they become
extremely shy of each other, and soon separate. The settlers are
allowed to be present, but not the convicts, whom they call
croppies, of course a word which they have learnt from the
whites.</p>
<p class="foot">[* A rule that is also strictly observed amongst
the Bulloms of Western Africa, who have an institution peculiar
to themselves called Purra, resembling, in some measure, our
Freemasonry. This forms another curious analogy between the
customs of barbarians so distant from each other.]</p>
<p>With respect to losing the teeth, it is evident that the
custom varies throughout the island, for Dampier saw many people
who had lost both the upper teeth; but they frequently lose, as
at Port Macquarrie, only one. Some writers say the women of
certain tribes lose an eye; of others, a finger: the first I do
not believe, the second I doubt. The unhappy creatures may
sometimes lose an eye when carried off by their brutal ravishers,
as they are certain of receiving a dreadful beating. Among the
numerous natives with whom I have met, not one was mutilated in
any way. Assuming that the assertions respecting the loss of a
finger be true, the excision may relate to some idea analogous to
that of an African tribe. A Bojesman was asked how he lost the
joint of a little finger? He replied that his mother, having lost
all her previous offspring soon after their birth, had cut off
the joint to prevent the like misfortune from happening to
him.</p>
<p>Of the mode employed in curing diseases, I know but little,
and am induced to think they trust very much to nature. The most
ridiculous, not to say disgusting, piece of quackery that came
under my observation, was a pretended cure for the head-ache. The
wife of the patient took a bowl of water, and then drawing a slip
of opossum skin across her gums until they bled, expectorated
into the bowl: as soon as she thought there was sufficient blood,
she gave the bowl to her husband, who immediately swallowed the
contents, which he believed to be an infallible remedy! **</p>
<p class="foot">[** The celebrated Boyle was subject to a bleeding
at the nose, and is said to have been cured <i>by the application
of moss from a dead man's skull!</i> Ought we to be surprised at
the remedy employed by the New Hollander?]</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image2" id="Image2"></a><img alt=""
width="640" src="1402161h-images/Image2.jpg"><br></p>
<p>The arms of the <i>aborigines</i> consist of the spear,
boomerang, and several kinds of waddie. The first is nine or ten
feet in length, and about the thickness of one's finger; the
point is commonly jagged, or barbed, but not always. It is thrown
with considerable exactness to a distance of more than sixty
yards, and some say a hundred, which is an exaggeration. It may
be thrown that distance, but not with precision. The impetus is
greatly increased by the use of the wommora, or throwing-stick
(Nos. 9 and 11), a piece of wood about three feet in length,
three inches broad at one end, and going off to a point at the
other, to which a sort of hook is fastened. This hook being
inserted into a small hole at the extremity of the spear, and the
wommora grasped close to the broad part of it, the spear itself
is brought beneath the middle finger. The wommora acting like a
sling, or rather upon the same principle, it may easily be
conceived that a powerful man will cause a good spear to fly to
an astonishing distance.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image3" id="Image3"></a><img alt=""
width="500" src="1402161h-images/Image3.jpg"><br></p>
<p>The boomerang is of various forms; the most common, however,
are those in the plate. This is one of the most curious weapons
of war ever invented, at least by a barbarous people; nor is it
easy to comprehend by what law of projectiles it is made to take
the singular direction that it frequently does. I have seen a
native throw one so as to make it go forty or fifty yards
horizontally, and not more than three or four feet from the
ground; it would then suddenly dart into the air to the height of
fifty or sixty yards, describe a very considerable curve, and,
finally, fall at his feet! From numerous attempts I am inclined
to think those only of a peculiar shape can be made invariably to
return&mdash;as, for instance, No. 4: the others, although they
may often do so, are more designed for throwing straight, and at
the legs of the enemy; in which case they are made to go either
horizontally or hoop fashion&mdash;that is to say, the points or
extremities alternately strike the ground. In all cases, no
matter how thrown, the boomerang keeps turning with great
rapidity, like a piece of wood revolving on a pivot, and with a
whizzing noise. It is always made of hard wood, is 30 or 40
inches in length, two-and-a-half to three inches wide at the
broadest part, and tapers away at each end nearly to a point. The
concave part is from one-eighth to one-fourth of an inch thick,
and the convex is quite sharp. It is a dangerous weapon, and
should be very cautiously used by those who do not understand it,
as no person, save a native, can ever be certain where it will
fall.</p>
<p>I have thrown, or rather pretended to throw, a boomerang,
formed like No. 4, at an object on the ground, and about ten
yards distant. If cleverly managed it would go within a few
inches (sometimes two, perhaps three) of the object, and rise, at
once, vertically; or otherwise proceed many yards close to the
ground, and then ascend; almost invariably describing a long
curve, and frequently returning to within three or four yards of
my feet. Even if it strikes the ground it will often move along
hoop fashion, and then rise to a great height, and return to the
thrower! Of course, when thrown in this way, the blacks mean only
to amuse themselves; for, when in earnest, they always make it
proceed horizontally, or vertically, and in either case it
inflicts serious wounds.</p>
<p>Nos. 5 and 6 are made to strike with alone, or perhaps are
occasionally thrown; and No. 3 I do not comprehend, being unable
to make it go horizontally, or vertically, or any other way, with
any exactitude. No. 7 is a formidable weapon used at Port
Macquarrie; its length is three feet, and the arm (if it may be
so termed) about eighteen inches more; and the reason why it is
made of that peculiar shape, is, that the warrior may be enabled
to strike <i>round</i> the shield, or elaman, of his
adversary.</p>
<p>The waddies, No 12, and nullah-nullahs, are clubs, made, as
might naturally be expected, of no small solidity, as they would
otherwise make but little impression on the skull of a New
Hollander. The tomahawks, Nos. 8 and 10, that they use are very
clumsy, but at the same time curious; they are made of a piece of
hard stone, fixed sometimes between two sticks, but not
unfrequently it is thickly coated, except at the edges, with some
kind of gum (probably that of the grass-tree), which in a short
time becomes almost as hard as the stone itself. The stick, or
handle, seldom more than ten or fifteen inches long, is fixed in
the gum, and has the appearance of being let into the stone, but
it is not so. With this rude instrument they cut the notches in
the trees by which they ascend, and I have no doubt use them in
their wars as well. At King George's Sound, a piece of glass or
quartz is secured, with the same kind of gum, to the end of the
handle of a wommera. This constitutes the rude knife with which
they fashion their arms or scrape them smooth.</p>
<p>It is by no means improbable that their wars are caused, for
the most part, by the way in which they manage their marriages
and funerals; as, in the one case, they commit an act of
aggression; in the other, they wish to avenge a supposed murder:
in fact, with the exception of an accidental rencontre, in
consequence of transgressing, likely-enough unwittingly, upon the
hunting grounds of another tribe, I know not what other motive
they can have for fighting; they have no religious wars amongst
them, nor do they slay each other because of a different way of
thinking.</p>
<p>By civilizing them, a stop might, perchance, be put to these
eternal quarrels; but more than forty years have elapsed since
the country was colonized, and I have not yet heard of an
instance of a single native having been reclaimed from barbarism.
A chief named Bennilong was sent to England, where he remained
for a time, met with every encouragement while there, and, on his
return to the colony, was treated with every possible kindness
and attention; but notwithstanding he had rooms at Government
House, a servant to wait upon him, and, in short, every comfort
he could require, his clothes were one day found in the domain,
and he had returned to his native forests, in order to resume his
old and independent habits! so likewise a girl that was educated
at the Orphan School, the moment she was put out to service,
escaped into the "bush," and was no more seen! Our wonderment is
greatly excited at this, because we do not reflect that it must
be equally difficult for them to change their habits as for
ourselves; they like to lead a life of independence&mdash;we are
of a different way of thinking: we laugh at them for disdaining
the comforts of life (as we call them), and, they, in return,
ridicule our sophisticated and factitious habits.</p>
<p>They are said to be idle, and averse to labour, which I can
contradict, having seen them work with quite as much activity as
the convicts, particularly in assisting the settlers to get in
their harvest; it is, therefore, an act of injustice to say, as
many do, that they are incorrigibly lazy. Even taking it for
granted that they actually are averse to labour a point I by no
means concede, they then only resemble other uncivilized people.
The natives of western Africa are called indolent;
<i>naturally</i> they may perhaps be so, but so far from this
being <i>always</i> the case, I need only instance the Kroomen
and Fishmen (they possess the country about Cape Palmas, are
neighbours, and also enemies), some of the most hard-working
people I have ever met with. The reason is obvious; their love of
gain forms an incentive to labour, and this is the cause of
exertion with all savage nations whatever: for where there is a
motive for shaking off their sloth, they can be just as
industrious as the whites.</p>
<p>The New Hollanders, like all the Hunter tribes, wish to be
entirely unshackled in their movements (nothing is more natural),
and they will, in all likelihood, remain so for a long period to
come; for civilization is always of slow, growth, and therefore
not likely to advance with rapid strides among savages, whose
lives are wandering, precarious, and turbulent, and who delight
in liberty and independence.</p>
<p>As to the observation made by many, that the natives are
anthropophagi, we have no decided proof of this being true; and
although I have questioned a person who declared, in the
strongest terms, that he had come suddenly upon a party, and
actually seen the remains of their diabolical feast, I am,
notwithstanding, not the less inclined to be of opinion that the
accounts of their cannibalism are greatly exaggerated, probably
utterly false; because, whenever any of them have been killed by
the convicts, and others, the latter have invented all sorts of
ridiculous tales concerning them, in order that they may be
furnished with an excuse for taking away their lives. We are told
that a party, while on an expedition into the interior, about
three years since, ascertained beyond a doubt that the natives
had "killed and eaten two Irishmen, who had gone in search of
Timor;" but as the former would not answer any of the questions
that were put to them concerning this matter, my incredulity
still remains, as I do not comprehend, in consequence, how the
truth of the story could be known with any certainty.</p>
<p>With regard to their language, it is pretty certain that each
tribe has a dialect more or less different from that of its
neighbours&mdash;the difference being greater according to the
distance the tribes are asunder; and, judging from some of the
words, many of the dialects must be very pleasing to the ear. The
following have been selected at random:&mdash;</p>

<p>Those which stand alone are names of places. It will easily be
seen, by these words, how numerous are the vowels in the dialects
of these people. Some words contain an unusual number;
Wooloomooloo, a place near Sydney, is one. Many more could be
adduced, but the above will suffice; and it were to be wished
that the native names were more generally adopted, instead of the
senseless terms so commonly applied. In some instances several
places have been called after the same person, whereby no small
confusion is often caused to those who are not aware of it. One
example alone in each colony will suffice to show to what a
ridiculous extent this changing of names is carried.
Coolapatambah, the English of which is "where the eagle drinks,"
is the native name of a mountain no great way from Port
Macquarrie; instead of this euphonous and poetic name being
retained, that of Mount Cairncross has been substituted; and, in
Van Dieman's Land, the Frenchman's Cap, as it was formerly
called, has been rebaptised, and is now the Peak of Teneriffe, a
term even more absurd than the other; at least, I never was able
to discover what the Peak of Teneriffe has to do with Tasmania;
nor is it easy to understand why a term should have been chosen
from a foreign colony, when a much better might, with so much
facility, have been taken from the numberless mountains in the
United Kingdom. I fear the reader will think I have been too
prolix in my observations on the aborigines, but this could not
well be avoided without omitting much interesting matter.</p>
<p>In respect to the small variety of animals, this country
resembles America, especially in there being none of the
ferocious kind indigenous to it; in fact, I doubt if the variety
be near so great; but if we consider only the peculiarities of
the different kinds, we shall discover no resemblance whatever
between them and those of other regions. Most of the quadrupeds
are night animals, and this accounts at once for the silence and
solitude of the vast forests that are spread over the island. I
have frequently ridden sixty or eighty miles and scarcely met a
living creature, which is one reason why few persons like to ride
alone in the "bush;" for what can be more cheerless than to
travel a whole day through a dreary and desolate forest without
seeing an animal of any description save an occasional lizard or
snake, or possibly one or two small birds! On a moonlight night,
however, some parts of the country literally teem with life, and
at this time the traveller may amuse himself with observing the
gambols of the squirrels and opossums, or the flight of the
larger kind of bat. The native dog (<i>Canis Australis</i>)
appears to be the most active, as he is ever on the look out for
prey, and he may sometimes be perceived crouched near a herd of
cattle, ready to pounce upon a young calf the instant its parent
moves from its side. Several have frequently been found together,
and there is little doubt of their hunting in packs. One
gentleman came unexpectedly upon no less than thirteen; they were
devouring a yearling steer, and close by were the remains of a
calf, a mare, and the foal of the last, supposed to have been
killed by them.</p>
<p>This animal resembles a fox, and the smell is often very
nearly the same; in its general appearance it may be considered a
breed between the fox and the wolf, larger than the former,
smaller than the other. It is about two feet high, and two feet
and a half long, with a head like that of the fox, and erect
ears. The colour varies, but most of those I saw were of a
reddish brown: he howls in a dismal manner, seldom if ever barks,
and not unfrequently yelps like the common dog. Whether it is
indigenous to New Holland, or introduced from some other country,
is not ascertained; but there is little, if any, reason for
supposing it to be the Malay dog, as the latter carries his tail
curled over his back, and is shorter in the body in proportion to
his height.</p>
<p>If I had not witnessed the death of some of the native dogs,
and also gained my information from the best sources, I should
consider the accounts respecting the tenacity of life shown by
these animals to be incredible; and although the following
anecdote will very probably cause a smile of incredulity in the
reader, he may rest assured that it is perfectly true; for I can
vouch for the veracity of my informant, who was actually present
when the occurrence took place. He hunted a native dog in the
usual way, caught him, and, as he imagined, killed him. He then
directed the animal to be skinned, which was accordingly done,
the neck and head being left untouched: the carcass was left on
the ground. On the return of the gentleman two or three hours
afterwards, he had the curiosity to look for the body, that he
might see if the eaglehawks had commenced their feast; to his
utter astonishment it had disappeared, and he found it had
crawled into a hollow log that lay close by the place where the
poor brute was skinned. He immediately had the animal dragged out
and its throat cut.</p>
<p>I once had five dogs with me, and they caught a large native
dog; the little pack did their best to kill him, and my companion
and self assisted them to the utmost, by alternately pounding him
with a stout piece of wood: when we supposed his soul had winged
its flight to other realms (as the rhapsodists say) I deprived
him of his tail, intending to keep it as a trophy of my own
prowess. To my no small surprise he seemed to be revived by the
excision, for he got up again; nor was it without some difficulty
that we at last slew him.</p>
<p>The full-grown males seldom make any noise, allowing
themselves to be worried without a yelp or whine. One, not much
more than half-grown, only howled until the dogs laid hold of
him; he then ceased to cry, and young as he was, underwent a
considerable deal of thrashing with a stout waddie, before he was
killed. Sometimes, when hard put to it, he will feign to be dead,
and may then be pulled about with impunity, for in spite of blows
and bites he will show no signs of life. This occasionally
deceives his enemies, and they quit him; he then marches off,
doubtless laughing in his sleeve at their mistake, so that
Tribe's plan of making sure, is decidedly the best.</p>
<p>Considerable animosity exists between this animal and the
domestic dog; they have nevertheless been known to breed
together; but the idea that the former invariably takes out the
piece of which he lays hold is an error, nor do his teeth always
meet; for I saw one sieze a young mastiff, hold it for some time,
and yet not leave a mark. Whether it preys upon its own species I
cannot say; it is certain if one is killed, the others will eat
him. They hunt by scent, and have been seen in small packs in
pursuit of the kangaroo. A settler watched one which was running
a kangaroo of some size; when the latter turned round to fight,
the dog would leave it; and the moment the kangaroo set off
again, its pursuer would keep biting at the hind quarters: this
went on until the former was exhausted; at this moment the
settler rode up and secured it.</p>
<p>The native dog is found throughout New Holland, but is not
known in Van Dieman's Land: its bite is supposed to be mortal to
sheep, and a single individual has been known to worry from
fifteen to twenty in the course of a night: it also destroys a
great number of poultry.</p>
<p>Of kangaroos there are several kinds which vary in size, and
in respect to their haunts, or places where they are commonly to
be found. The following are the only species I have seen, and the
names are those used at Liverpool Plains, and in some other parts
of the colony; but each tribe seems to employ different terms;
Wallaba, and Paddiemalla, are very commonly employed:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote">Cannoor. Large red kangaroo.<br>
<br>
Wallaroo. Large black rock kangaroo.<br>
<br>
Kangaroo. Common kangaroo.</p>
<p class="negindent">Wallaba. Dark brown: it is found in brushes.
When cooked whole it is rather larger than a jack hare.</p>
<p class="negindent">Paddiamalla. Frequents blady-grass flats,
and nearby hills.</p>
<p class="negindent">Wirrang.&mdash;Bittang. Rock kangaroos.
These are small and much alike; but the first is larger than the
other.</p>
<p class="negindent">Kangaroo Rat. It is about the size of a wild
rabbit, and lives in hollow logs.</p>
<p class="quote">Boomah. Implies a large kangaroo.</p>
<p class="negindent">Forester. Found in forest land. There appear
to me two or three kangaroos called by this name; the largest is
not less than four feet high.</p>
<p class="negindent">Brash. It is of a size between the Wallaba
and Forester.</p>
<p>The flesh of this animal is excellent eating, and is usually
made into soup, or steamer. It may easily be conceived how rich
the former must sometimes be, when I state that we one day killed
three kangaroos, each weighing from thirty to forty pounds, and
that the hind quarters and tails, the only portions considered
worth cooking, were made into soup for <i>four</i> persons: very
little water was added, so that it was, in fact, rather gravy
than soup. This, however, is wanton waste; and if kangaroos are
slaughtered at this rate the race will soon become extinct in the
located parts of the colony; even at present it is often
difficult to find a kangaroo, where, three years since, fifty or
a hundred were seen in one flock.</p>
<p>A steamer consists of pork and kangaroo minced together (the
latter being without fat, the pork is substituted), and, when
well cooked, is a dish fit for an alderman.</p>
<p>The kangaroo has rarely more than one at a birth, and never
exceeds two. Its ordinary spring is from twelve to fifteen feet,
but one of them in descending a slope, when pursued, cleared
twenty-one paces, or nearly fifteen yards&mdash;indeed the
distance, if any thing, exceeded that number of yards. From the
form of the foot they can jump from a considerable height without
injury. This animal can be made perfectly tame in the course of a
few days; and I met with an instance of one becoming reconciled
to its change of life before the expiration of the third day. It
was kept loose in the hut where the convicts lived! and the hut
was constantly frequented by the very dogs by which it was
caught.</p>
<p>The kangaroo has many enemies, the eaglehawk not being the
least formidable.</p>
<p>It has been considered a curious circumstance that the fox,
when tamed or in captivity, will be perfectly free from danger,
even though kept in a place where there are fox-hounds; but if he
were seen running about a field, or coursing over it, by any of
the canine race, his life would without doubt fall a sacrifice to
his gambols. Now a kangaroo will commonly keep near the house,
but may often be observed hopping along with great speed to a
distance of some hundred yards; yet neither the dogs that caught
it, nor any of the species belonging to the establishment, will
attempt to molest. A strange dog, however, could not be
trusted.</p>
<p>In hunting the kangaroo, the settlers make use of a breed
between the greyhound and some other dog, as also of the former
itself; but the mixed breed, or the lurcher, is preferable on
account of its superior strength, which enables it to cope with
those of ft larger kind, some of which inflict most serious
wounds with the claw of the hind foot.</p>
<p>Many persons imagine it impossible that a kangaroo can escape
from so fleet an animal as the greyhound; yet we more than once
had a run of upwards of a mile, and after all to no purpose; for
as soon as it gets among low brush wood, or long wiry grass, the
dog has no chance of overtaking the creature, which bounds along
in a most extraordinary manner. The longest run I heard of was
rather more than two miles; the kangaroo escaped. The flying gin
(gin is the native word for woman or female) is a boomah, and
will leave behind every description of dog. As a proof of the
physical power of the kangaroo, I may instance that a gentleman
of some strength, and great activity, was knocked
head-over-heels, and had his coat torn from the shoulder to the
wrist, by one. It runs badly up an inclined plane.</p>
<p>Some of the dogs used in this kind of hunting, when taught,
will show astonishing sagacity, by returning to their master,
after having killed an animal, and conducting him to the spot
where they have left the quarry.</p>
<p>It may here be observed, that the fox-hounds, which have been
introduced into the colony, are most unadvisedly permitted to
range alone, and on some occasions have been absent so long as
two entire days; a practice evidently contrary to the interest of
the settlers themselves; as if any of them were to become wild, a
circumstance not at all unlikely to happen, not only would the
whole race of kangaroos be destroyed, but the sheep, and even
cattle, would suffer in a far greater degree than at present.</p>
<p>The fox-hounds are not the only dogs that will hunt alone, for
a gentleman of my acquaintance in Van Dieman's Land had a kind of
Newfoundland dog, and a turnspit, which were continually in the
habit of hunting when unaccompanied. Their mode of managing was
as follows:&mdash;The turnspit having the better nose, found the
game, and its companion, being superior in speed, pursued it.
They were frequently watched while thus employed. But I am
digressing.</p>
<p>The Wombat (Phascolomys) was represented to me as precisely
resembling that of the other colony. It is rather scarce, and
considered excellent fare.</p>
<p>There, is, also, a species of sloth, which I did not see; it
appears to have the same habits as the common sloth.</p>
<p>The ornithorynchus paradoxus, called also platypus, duck-bill,
or water-mole, is one of the most singular animals in existence,
and has given rise to no small discussion amongst naturalists,
some of whom believe it to be oviparous, while others say it is
viviparous; there are, also, not a few persons who affirm that
the creature is both oviparous and mammiferous, laying its eggs
and hatching them, and afterwards suckling its young. I shot
several females, but found no eggs in them, and am well
acquainted with two or three of the settlers who have killed some
dozen, without having discovered aught like an egg. The natives
declare they are oviparous, and it must be confessed I was once
shown the remnants of an egg laid by one, or rather they were
<i>said</i> to have been so, which, notwithstanding I doubted
strongly, suspecting rather they were once the egg of some bird
or reptile. That it suckles its young will admit of little doubt,
as the milk may be expressed from the lacteal glands through the
skin of the animal: there are no nipples.</p>
<p>The food of this animal consists of shrimps, and animalculæ of
various kinds. When out in the mornings and evenings in search of
these, it may often be seen to rise to the surface, remain there
a few minutes, and then sink as quietly as it rose. It is
extremely wary, and will disappear at the slightest noise, on
which account it is rather difficult to shoot, the more so as its
fur is so thick that the shot will not always penetrate. At a
distance of not more than twenty-five yards, and although the gun
was fired from a bank quite over the animal, some of the shot
(number one) had barely perforated the skin, and hardly one had
entered the flesh; but its skull was broken. The dimensions of
the specimen now before me, a male, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The lower mandible is little more than half the size of the
upper. Of all the mammalia yet known, it seems the most
extraordinary in its conformation, exhibiting the perfect
resemblance of the bill of a duck engrafted on the head of a
quadruped. The body is depressed, and has some resemblance to
that of an otter in miniature. It is covered with a very thick,
soft, and beaver-like fur. The head is flattish, and rather
small; the tail flat, furry like the body, and obtuse. The legs
are short, terminating in a broad web; this on the fore feet
extends some way beyond the claws, the number on which is five,
and they are straight, strong, and sharp-pointed; the two
exterior ones being somewhat shorter than the three middle. On
the hind feet there are six claws, longer, and more inclining to
a curved form than those before; one of these is seated much
higher up than the rest, and resembles a strong sharp spur. In
fact, to my common apprehension, it appeared to be neither more
or legs. The internal edges of the under mandible, are serrated
or channelled with numerous striæ, as in a duck's bill.</p>
<p>The colour of the back is dark grey, sometimes approaching to
black; that of the belly is rather lighter.</p>
<p>The platypus forms a hole in the side of a bank, just above
the usual surface of the water; it then burrows almost
horizontally to a distance of twenty or thirty feet from the
entrance, and always in a zig-zag direction.</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind, that I am noticing the different
animals for the information of the general reader, not of the
naturalist.</p>
<p>The ornithorynchus hystrix, or porcupine anteater, is totally
different from the ornithorynchus paradoxus, nor am I able to
discover the slightest similitude between them. The dimensions of
a living specimen which I possess are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The second claw is nearly as long, and the other three much
shorter.</p>
<p>On the fore feet they are nearly the same as on those
behind.</p>
<p>Its natural food consists of ant eggs, but I feed mine in the
same way in which nightingales are fed in England and Germany,
that is, with eggs and meat chopped very small. Its mode of
eating is very curious, the tongue being used, sometimes, in the
manner employed by the chamelion, and at others as a mower uses
his scythe; there is an adhesive substance on the tongue which
lays hold of the food. From what I have seen of this animal I
should suppose it to be, of its size, the strongest quadruped in
existence.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The animal alluded to died suddenly a few
hours after I had written the above, and not unlikely in
consequence of the cold off Cape Horn: its death may also have
been caused through my omitting the meat, and confining the
creature to a diet of eggs, some of which were very bad. With
more care it might have been got safe to England.]</p>
<p>The flying squirrel, often called the flying oppossum, though
why I do not comprehend, is the petaurus Australis (Sciurus) of
naturalists. It is a beautiful animal, and I had a fine specimen,
but it was killed by the dogs.</p>
<p>The flying fox, or vampire bat, is about the size of a rat,
and is covered with a soft reddish coloured fur. It is not often
seen, and I understand is chiefly found in the "New Country,"
(Argyle, etc. etc.) I had one 28 inches from tip to tip of the
wings.</p>
<p>The bandacoot is somewhat larger than a rat. The oppossum
(there are two kinds) is from the size of a kitten to that of a
cat, and is greatly coveted, as a delicacy, by the natives,
though never eaten by the whites: and there are some other
animals for a description of which I must refer the reader to the
works of those who are more conversant with the subject than
myself. But I may not omit mentioning the flying mouse (dwarf
flying phalanger): this beautiful little creature measures from
nose to tail rather under three inches; the latter is two inches
and a half long; and the width of the body when spread out is
nearly two inches. The colour of the fur is rather lighter than
that of the common mouse, and the fur itself is much softer.</p>
<p>Reptiles are numerous, though perhaps less so than might have
been expected; and they are not spread equally over the colony,
being much more common in some parts than in others.</p>
<p>The diamond snake attains the length of fifteen feet, and even
more; but one of this size is very rarely seen. The largest I saw
killed, measured nine feet and a half; and a gentleman told me he
had fired at one which he felt positive was as long as two panels
(sixteen feet) of the fence by which he saw it. By some it is
said to be poisonous, and by others quite innocuous: and
therefore I shall only say, that, if poisonous, it is, as far as
I know, the largest snake that is so. The black, and also the
brown snake, are both venomous; but they have already been
noticed, and I shall therefore make only one remark concerning
them, as it appears to me rather curious that these reptiles
should prey upon each other, and after such a strange fashion. At
a settler's house, where I passed the night, a black snake was
killed some few hours before my arrival; on opening it there was
found in its stomach the <i>headless</i> body of a brown snake
that had been dead a very short time. Now, in the first place,
snakes will rarely swallow that which has not life; secondly, two
venomous animals when fighting would naturally be expected to
destroy each other. Dr. Good says, all snakes have an immunity
against each other's bite, except the rattle-snake, which not
only kills every other, and even its own kind, but by being so
far irritated as to inflict a personal wound, has been known to
kill itself. Admitting this immunity exists, still I was not
aware before that one poisonous reptile would prey upon another.
The black and brown snakes are supposed by many to be male and
female; the above circumstance goes some way to prove the
contrary.</p>
<p>The death, or deaf adder is an ugly creature, and is
considered highly dangerous. A case of death caused by the bite
of one was communicated to me by a very respectable person who
had the account from the comrade of the deceased;* if it be
correct, of which there is sufficient reason to believe there is
little doubt, the death of the unfortunate man must have been
peculiarly dreadful, as the blood gushed from his eyes, nose,
mouth, and ears. Immediate decomposition commenced, and in a very
short space of time the body was in such a state that it was with
difficulty removed to where the grave had been dug. My informant,
who had been twenty-two years in the colony, emphatically added,
that when a person is bitten by a death adder he has scarcely
time to say, "Lord have mercy upon me!" before he becomes a
lifeless corpse. It is not, of course, impossible that there may
be some little exaggeration in the above relation, but in justice
to the narrator, although myself somewhat incredulous in regard
to these matters, it will be as well to mention one or two
snakes, whose poison, according to naturalists, is equally, or
more virulent. It is affirmed that, in Africa, there are several
the bite of which will cause a most horrible death. The person
bitten feels drowsy, and the form melts at once into a mass of
putrefaction. The burning snake of India can cause instant death,
the blood flowing from the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears, and
exuding from the pores. An American serpent, called <i>de la
crux</i>, is said to kill in the same manner; finally, the bite
of the naja is represented to be so fatal, that a person bitten
by one will die within the course of half an hour; his flesh
falling off his bones in a semi-dissolved state. Granting all
this to be the case, I am not less of opinion that people are
often unnecessarily afraid of snakes, for the latter are, in all
probability, the more alarmed of the two; as, whenever
approached, so far from evincing any inclination to attack, they
appear anxious to get out of the way with all possible haste.</p>
<p class="foot">[* It occurred some years ago.]</p>
<p>The natives have some mode of extracting their fangs, for they
have been seen playing with them, and allowing them to entwine
round their bodies.</p>
<p>Lizards are numerous, and some attain the length of three or
four feet; the most remarkable are the Jew lizard, which has a
membrane that it can extend in such a manner as to form a
complete ruff round its neck; the capucin, which, I am told, for
I never saw one, can erect a membrane so as to form a kind of
cap; and at Liverpool Plains, we met with a lizard resembling
very much a miniature alligator.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** Alligators are common on the north coasts of
New Holland.]</p>
<p>It is a remarkable circumstance, that all the dogs in New
South Wales show the greatest antipathy to every description of
reptile; they will often attack lizards and snakes the instant
they descry them. Nor is it less singular to observe their
sagacity when assaulting such dangerous enemies as the last, for
they rarely get bitten by them.</p>
<p>The birds of New South Wales, though not distinguished by
qualities so characteristic as those observed in the other
animals, are yet in some respects highly interesting and curious;
and the varieties are not only almost endless, but the plumage of
many is remarkable for its great beauty and brilliancy of
colours. I shall notice very few, and those only familiar to the
colonists; as it would afford neither amusement nor instruction
to peruse a cursory and superficial description of birds now seen
in every museum.</p>
<p>It may naturally be expected that in a region so extensive the
feathered tribe will vary according to climate and locality; and
such we find is the case; those most noted for their plumage
coming from places remote from the capital, particularly from the
northward.</p>
<p>The largest and principal is the emu, and it is also one of
the most easily tamed, after which it becomes an amusing pet,
being as domestic as a dog. From six to eighteen eggs have been
found in the same nest, if nest it can be called, though whether
laid by one bird or more is uncertain. One portion of this
singular bird is considered tolerable eating, being somewhat
similar to beef, but it is killed more on account of the oil
procured from its fat, which is used for burning, preserving
leather (it is thought to do so better than any other), and as a
remedy for the rheumatism.</p>
<p>Among some of the natives, no woman is allowed to eat of the
emu (nor of the kangaroo), neither is any male permitted to do
so, until she or he has attained a certain age; but for what
reason I was unable to ascertain.</p>
<p>The native companion (<i>ardea antigone</i>), a gigantic
crane, is a most stately bird, of a pale ash colour, with some
red about the head, and six feet high. It is often seen at Lakes
Bathurst and George, on Liverpool Plains, and elsewhere,
sometimes in flocks of thirty or forty. It derives its name from
the facility with which it becomes domesticated.</p>
<p>Black swans are found on all the lakes, and at the entrance of
all the rivers, that is to say, in the least frequented parts;
for, like the emu, they are rapidly retiring to places where they
are less liable to be disturbed. Many consider them excellent
fare, while I pronounce them to be fit food for those only who
are unable to procure something more palatable. There are
wretches, who, in order to procure the skin free from oil, starve
the bird to death.</p>
<p>Pelicans are not numerous in those parts of the colony which I
have visited; other aquatic birds, such as ducks, teal, and
widgeon, abound wherever they can find a sequestered spot; on
Liverpool Plains there are vast flights of them. The musk duck is
a curious bird, and has such short wings that it cannot fly; it
is oftener seen than shot, as it dives the instant the trigger is
drawn: I fired four times at one, and a friend of mine eight or
nine times at another; and although the shot were of large size,
and went all round and over the duck, it yet escaped.</p>
<p>The native turkey, or bustard of New Holland, is as large as a
common turkey, but of different form and plumage: it weighs from
15 to 18 pounds, and is most excellent eating.</p>
<p>Eagles and hawks are seen every where, and some of them are of
considerable dimensions; the wings of the eagle-hawk, as it is
called, being nine feet from tip to tip. The white hawk, that
rare bird, I saw only once, at Hunter's River.</p>
<p>There are said to be not less than thirty varieties of pigeon,
of which the most beautiful come from Shoal Haven and Moreton
Bay. The most common is the bronze-winged about the size of a
tame pigeon; but although a handsome bird, it is very far
inferior to the won-ga won-ga, and several others. The small
green pigeon, and a dove, both from Moreton Bay, are perhaps
superior to the whole tribe in elegance of form and plumage,
though inferior to some in gaudiness of colours.</p>
<p>Of snipe there are two kinds, and three of quail; one of the
latter is very small and of a dark colour, and not so common as
the others.</p>
<p>The varieties of the parrot tribe appear to be countless, and
they are more numerous than sparrows are with us!</p>
<p>White cockatoos are seen in large flocks in some districts,
and seem to keep more inland than near the coast: from their
destruction of maize and corn, they are looked upon, with good
reason, as great pests. Near Bathurst a piece of ground was so
covered with these birds, that they had the appearance, at a
distance, of snow! The noise they make is abominable, and nothing
can be more disagreeable than to hear their harsh and discordant
screams resounding through the forest.</p>
<p>The black cockatoo is a handsome bird; its note is melancholy
and loud, totally different from that of the white one, and far
less unpleasant. As it feeds upon grubs, no person has, I
believe, succeeded in keeping one alive beyond a few days. The
crop, when filled with its favourite food, the large white grub,
or maggot, is highly relished by the natives, who deem it
unnecessary to have recourse to the assistance of the culinary
art to improve its flavour.</p>
<p>Both kinds of cockatoos are eaten, though I cannot say much in
their favour as an article of diet, as they are tough, and fit
only for a stew.</p>
<p>All the different kinds of parrots are more destructive than
any birds we have;* notwithstanding which, there are persons who
talk of the <i>advantages</i> to be derived from the introduction
of these pests into England, where, say they, it would have a
pretty effect to see them walking before our windows or doors. I
doubt greatly if our gardeners would not be of opinion that they
would appear to more advantage in a pie, seeing they are
uncommonly expert at clearing the trees both of buds and fruit,
and likewise at destroying grain of every kind. They are good
eating, especially curried. While on an excursion at Swan River,
being six persons in number, we made each evening an
<i>ollapodrida</i> of the birds shot during the day; take as a
specimen one compound which consisted of a swan, a duck, a teal,
three cockatoos, (two white, the other black,) a host of smaller
kind of parrots, with rice and potatoes; these being stewed
together, formed a mess which would not have been admired at a
Lord Mayor's feast, but was discussed by us with considerable
satisfaction after a hard day's toil.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Garcilasso de la Vega relates, that his father
lost his way amongst the Cordilleras, and that he directed his
course towards that point to which the parrots had steered their
flight; by which means he came to a habitation! This plan would
hardly have availed him in Australia.]</p>
<p>The spur-winged plover frequents the open parts of the
country, and is chiefly remarkable for having a large spur upon
the shoulder of each wing; it fights desperately.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of pheasant, as they are termed,
(<i>superba,</i>) one of which has been said to equal, in point
of plumage, the birds of Paradise! It has certainly a handsome
tail, but the plumage of the body is not equal to that of a
common barn-door hen. The other called the swamp pheasant,
(<i>cuculus phasianus,</i>) is a handsome bird, without such a
tail. They do not in any respect resemble a pheasant.</p>
<p>The common crow is found on both coasts.</p>
<p>Of magpies there are three kinds, and one of them is eaten by
the colonists. These birds are easily tamed, and taught to
whistle a great variety of airs.</p>
<p>The laughing jackass, a senseless term, is the <i>dacelo
gigantea</i>: its note bears a slight resemblance to the coarse
and boisterous laugh of a man, but is much louder and more
dissonant. It destroys snakes and other reptiles, and should
therefore never be injured.</p>
<p>The coachman, or coachwhip, is a small bird, with a nate which
terminates in a jerk, and a peculiar sound, something like the
crack of a whip, hence its name.</p>
<p>One of the most extraordinary notes I heard, is that of a
green bird, with white spots, and about the size of a small
pigeon; there were two together in a lofty tree, and the noise
they made was so exactly like that of two cats when fighting,
that I at first actually imagined such to be the fact; it has
been named the cat-bird.</p>
<p>The regent and satin birds are particularly beautiful,
especially the former; and there are many others which it is
unnecessary to mention in a work of this description.</p>
<p>Partridges and pheasants have been introduced, and the former
have bred (they were only brought to Sydney last year;) but they
should have been turned out up the country, and not near the
capital, where they will most probably, soon be destroyed.</p>
<p>At Dalwood, an estate on the Hunter, where I passed several
highly agreeable days, there occurred a singular instance of the
familiarity of the swallow, which may possibly interest those who
are partial to natural history. Three of these birds commenced
building in the <i>drawing-room</i>; one of them secured a spot
under the table, but, in consequence of the dirt it caused, was
ejected; another completed its nest at the comer of the chimney
piece, and laid two eggs; being, however, often disturbed by the
curiosity of the children, it deserted its habitation: the third
built over one of the windows, and, during my visit, was setting!
The room was constantly occupied, though as the weather was warm
and fine, the doors and windows were open throughout the day. It
is worthy of observation, that although the swallow of New South
Wales constructs its nest, even when beneath a verandah, of great
solidity, and with a neck five or six inches long, like that of a
battle, the aperture of which is only large enough to admit the
bird, here were three nests entirely open. This would seem to
imply a considerable degree of instinct in these birds.</p>
<p>The insect tribe are very numerous. As they are, however, now
so well known in the cabinets of collectors, I shall only detain
the reader by noticing a few of them.</p>
<p>The locust is common only in particular parts of the colonies;
for I have sometimes journied a long distance without meeting
one, and then unexpectedly found myself surrounded by them: the
noise they make resembles somewhat that of the large saw used for
cutting up timber, though varying greatly at times, and is
particularly disagreeable.</p>
<p>Scorpions (at Swan River three were caught in my tent,)
centipedes, and tarantulas are found; but I never heard of their
doing any injury. Of the mantis there are several varieties, and
their nests, or whatever they are called, are remarkable. I have
two which were packed in paper; on opening it during the voyage,
it was discovered that the eggs contained in one of them were
hatched; about fifty young ones, of course dead, being found in
the envelope.</p>
<p>Butterflies are not numerous, nor did I perceive much beauty
of colours in the greater number of them; those, however, of some
of the beetles are uncommonly brilliant.</p>
<p>The blow-fly is a greater nuisance, both in New Holland and
Van Dieman's Land, than all the other insects and reptiles
united. Meat is often blown immediately: kill an animal with the
intention of preserving it as a specimen, and the chances are
that in a short time it is completely blown, so that it must be
skinned and preserved at once. At Swan River an officer found his
carpet-bag swarming with the progeny of this loathsome insect;
and at Hobart Town I saw the same thing occur with a piece of
green baize: in short, nothing woolen appears to be exempt from
it. It is about the size of our blue-bottle fly, and is found on
the summits of the mountains as well as in the valleys; but where
it deposits its larvae, when on the former, seems rather
doubtful, as dead animals are not often met with on the high
grounds.</p>
<p>Of bees there are three kinds, the principal of which is not
larger than a common sized winged ant; they form their hives in
hollow trees or logs, produce a great deal of honey, and are
without stings. The blacks are very fond of the honey, and have
several ways of discovering it. English bees have lately been
introduced.</p>
<p>There are several varieties of ants; one is nearly an inch in
length, and, as I have already stated, stings and bites most
furiously. The "gigantic" ant does not form a nest like that made
by the smaller kinds, being more commonly found beneath large
stones, or in sandy spots, where the elevation made by them is
very trifling. One species forms a mound a few feet above the
surrounding ground, from three or four, to fifteen or more in
diameter, and generally where the soil consists of small
iron-stone pebbles, or gravel; it often proves a great pest in
gardens. Ant-nests are also found in trees, at a considerable
height from the ground; and I have likewise seen them made more
solid and compact than even those in Africa, though much smaller;
these were invariably deserted.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Those in Africa are built in a pyramidal form,
rise to the height of fifteen feet, and the base is often seven
or eight feet in diameter.]</p>
<p>While at Swan River, and seated one evening with some friends,
in my tent, an incredible number of winged ants entered, and
almost covered the sides of it, besides flying into our tea, and
almost extinguishing the candles! In the course of half-an-hour
not one was visible, with the exception of those that were
scalded or burnt to death; but the articles of furniture, as well
as the ground, were strewed with their wings! This happened only
a few minutes previous to a tremendous squall.</p>
<p>A similar circumstance occurred in my presence in New South
Wales&mdash;vast numbers of ants suddenly issuing from a hole
beneath a verandah, depositing their wings, and then
disappearing!</p>
<p>Many of the insects display an ingenuity which is certainly
wonderful; witness the spider, which, in New South Wales, forms
its nest of a leaf, and then by running webs from one branch to
another, suspends it in such a way as to prevent its enemies from
reaching it.</p>
<p>So likewise another spider, peculiar to both New Holland and
Tasmania, excavates a circular hole in the ground, five or six
inches in depth, and with a door over it! When he sallies forth
to see the world, or in quest of food, the door is closed; but it
is always open when he is at home! (A good hint for our people of
fashion.). Some of the larger kinds have the same description of
habitation, without the door; most probably trusting to their own
strength, which enables them to eject any ordinary intruder.</p>
<p>The principal trees in the colony are the
following:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="negindent">Iron bark (Eucalyptus resinefera), used for
building, but more for fencing.</p>
<p class="negindent">Blue gum (Eucalyptus piperita), used for
ship-building and wheelwrights.</p>
<p class="quote">Black-butted gum, the same.<br>
<br>
Grey gum, for fencing, building, etc. etc.<br>
<br>
Stringy bark, for boards, and building purposes.<br>
<br>
Box, for wheelwrights, ploughs, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>The last are also varieties of the eucalyptus.</p>
<br>
<p class="negindent">Forest oak (Casuarina torulosa), Swamp oak
(Casuarina paludosa), for shingles and cabinet work.</p>
<p class="negindent">Cedar (Cedrela Australis), for cabinet
work.</p>
<p class="negindent">Turpentine (Tristania albicas), boats
etc.</p>
<p class="negindent">Sassafras, sometimes three feet in diameter,
for flooring (it is not common).</p>
<p class="negindent">Mountain ash, two kinds, for carriage
work.</p>
<p class="quote">Sallow, for gig-shafts.</p>
<p class="negindent">Pear (Xylomelum pyriforme), for
gun-stocks.</p>
<p class="negindent">Apple (Angophora laceolata), for boards and
building purposes.</p>
<p class="quote">Currajong, bark used for making cordage.</p>
<p class="negindent">White cedar (Melia azederach), for boards
and boat-building.</p>
<br>
<p>Several kinds of acacia are found in the colony, and a
considerable quantity of gum might be procured from this tree;
but it is entirely neglected, though perhaps not inferior, in
some respects, to the gum Arabic. Acacias have often been
observed to spring up on spots lately cleared, surrounded by
forest, and many miles from the nearest place where this tree is
known to grow (such is likewise the case with couch-grass), but
how to account for this is no easy matter. We are told that, in
Russia, when the pine-forests are consumed, they are not
succeeded by the pine and fir tribe, but by birch, poplar, lime,
and other trees; and in America, a field that had been cultivated
during a series of years, but which had previously produced
nothing save oaks and chesnuts, produced, when left to itself, a
thick grove of white pines! So likewise when ashes are strewed on
high and arid heaths in England, clover and vetches are said to
make their appearance; and in East Friesland wild clover is made
to grow by strewing pearl ashes on peat marshes! It is not
unlikely that some effect of the same kind may be caused by the
ashes of the trees burnt in New Holland.</p>
<p>The trees attain a surprising height, the stems sometimes
rising from fifty to eighty feet or more, with a few straggling
branches on the top, which have a most uncouth appearance, the
entire height of the tree being scarcely under 140 feet, and
often exceeding that.</p>
<p>One would imagine that a tree of this height, and too large to
be grasped (they may frequently be seen from five to ten feet in
diameter), would be utterly inaccessible, yet a New Hollander
will easily ascend the loftiest in the forest! While the great
toe of each foot rests on a notch, and the left-hand is employed
to steady the person with the assistance of another notch, the
right-hand is used for cutting one above; the native then holding
the tomahawk with his teeth ascends one step, and thus he
proceeds until he attains the summit I In the meantime his
companions wait patiently at the foot of the tree, prepared to
knock on the head any animal that may attempt to escape; or by
applying smoke at a hole below, drive it upwards, when the black
who has ascended is sure to secure it. In this manner they
capture; opossums, flying squirrels, etc.</p>
<p>Many trees have been named according to the caprice of the
colonists; the pear, oak, and several others bearing no more
resemblance to those of other climes than the beech does to the
yew.</p>
<p>A large proportion of the forest-trees are decayed in the
heart, so that it is no uncommon circumstance to cut down four or
five before one is found fit for use, unless for fencing. May not
this be caused by the fires which prevail every year, for the
grass being ignited, scorches the bark of the tree, and driving
the sap to the heart, causes a superabundance in that particular
part? It has often excited my surprise that even a single tree
should escape from the tremendous fires which so frequently
occur! The fire very frequently runs up the bark to the topmost
branch, making the tree as black as charcoal; yet it goes on
flourishing, although every succeeding year brings a recurrence
of the same scorching, and, occasionally, twice in the same
season: sometimes, indeed, the tree is destroyed, and nothing
remains but a huge black and hollow stump. It often happens that
a shrub, or young tree, is so effectually charred externally,
that a person naturally infers it must have perished, but in the
course of a few weeks it will throw out leaves, and as some of
these shrubs are naturally of a lively green, the contrast
between the green and black is rather singular.</p>
<p>To a person who has been in an American forest, and sank up to
the middle in decayed vegetable matter, or springing upon the
apparently sound trunk of a prostrate tree found himself half
buried in it, there is something very striking in the forests of
New Holland, where one so often observes a soil composed of
nothing whatever save sand, or sand and ironstone, with a scanty
herbage insufficient to conceal it. And even where the soil is of
a good quality the herbage is not always over-luxuriant. A
species of cotton plant was introduced some years since by an
officer, who fancied it would eventually form an article of
export; but it has proved a greater pest than that nuisance the
broom plant at the Bermudas, (introduced as being good for
hedges); nor can it possibly be eradicated, for the seed is
carried by every breeze to distant places, where it grows with
the greatest luxuriance, and is now rapidly overrunning the
colony. As it appears to require a certain temperature, one may
hope the climate of the elevated districts will prove too cold
for so useless a plant.</p>
<p>Some of the tropical fruits thrive quite as well at Sydney as
in their native climes, and oranges, lemons, limes, loquots, etc.
may be had in abundance; European fruits succeed better at
Bathurst and in Argyle, no fruit peculiar to warm climates
growing there. "Bacchus amat colles," says the proverb; if this
be true, the colony, with so congenial a climate, ought to
produce wine of excellent quality. The vine grows uncommonly
well, and the varieties now in the country are very numerous: and
as the settlers are directing their attention to the making of
wine, there is every probability of their ultimate success
provided they will but have patience. That which has hitherto
been made has proved what may be done if the wine be kept
sufficiently long.</p>
<p>The native fruits of the country are the cherry, raspberry,
currant, and gooseberry: they are chiefly used for preserves: and
are quite different from those of Europe.</p>
<p>Tobacco is cultivated by most of the settlers, and is now
become an article of export of some consideration, but the curing
of it is not yet fully understood. The sugar cane grows at Port
Macquarrie and will most probably succeed farther north as well
as at the Mauritius. In short, within the course of another
generation the colony may be expected to export, or supply
itself, with, sugar, coffee, indigo, tobacco, opium, and many
other articles, perhaps even silk.</p>
<p>Vegetation is most astonishingly rapid in these regions; and
although the reader should not yield implicit faith to what I may
write upon this subject, he may chance to meet with some person
who has been in the colony, and will then find, that however
exaggerated he considers many circumstances in this little work,
and however much he may think I have availed myself of the right
claimed by all travellers of amplifying, I have, nevertheless,
stated nothing that cannot be corroborated by any settler in
Australia. In order that I may not draw too largely upon his
stock of faith, I shall only mention one or two examples.</p>
<p>At Liverpool, in a small garden, or rather court yard, I was
shown a cabbage, the stalk of which, though crooked, was five
feet and a half high; and to the uppermost flowers (it had run to
seed) the height from the ground was <i>thirteen feet</i>, as
measured by an officer of the army and myself: it had produced
three heads.* At Edinglassie, a beautiful spot on the Nepean, the
Rosa multiflora grew from twenty to thirty feet in two years;
and, at a farm on the Hunter, the boughs of a willow had grown
sixteen feet in less time. As to the rapidity with which grafts
produce fruit, and fruit-stones or seeds, plants of good size, it
so far exceeds every thing of the kind in England, that although
a traveller, and consequently accustomed to "see strange things,"
I dare not describe it. Land which at my former visit to New
South Wales (1830) was entirely clear of wood, is now (1833)
thickly covered by trees of some size; and it always happens,
that land once cleared and neglected for a year or two, becomes
concealed by a forest far more dense than any before seen upon
it. Most of the trees are ever-green, consequently the eye dwells
eternally upon a forest that, instead of the bright and varied
tints in which nature is arrayed in other countries, presents to
view the dull and embrowned verdure, which has so often been
observed to detract from even an Italian landscape; and the
circumstances of many of them shedding their bark, which is seen
hanging in long strips from the stem or branches, tends not to
improve the effect. The acacias, when in flower, are assuredly
very beautiful, but in looking over a forest they are not
distinguished; as, if they grow there, they are over-topped by
all the tribe of eucalyptus.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The cabbage attains also a great height in
Jersey; according to some, even fourteen feet, while others say
it does not exceed seven feet.]</p>
<p>I cannot but think the colonists might more generally
introduce the various European trees upon their farms; for if no
immediate advantage accrue to themselves from doing so, their
children, at all events, will derive some benefit from it; and
this point might just as well be taken into consideration in
Australia, as in England. Surely our umbrageous and ornamental
trees, setting aside the value of the wood when arrived at
maturity, would conduce infinitely more to the beautifying of an
estate than the huge ungainly gums, crowned with a few scattered
branches, and affording little or no shade, so commonly seen
throughout the settlement. Even by encouraging clumps of acacias,
the appearance of the country would be improved; but the usual
excuse is, that both time and labour would be required, as well
as land, and that all three are too valuable to be expended upon
that which will make no quick return. Very little of the first,
and not much of the other two, could be required for a few seeds
of the oak, or any other tree; and one or two gentlemen in each
colony being of the same opinion, have put into the ground many
hundred of young plants and seeds.</p>
<p>As I have been asked by many persons what description of
plants are most required in the colonies, I have subjoined in the
appendix a list of the principal of them, in the hope that by so
doing the emigrant may be saved some trouble.</p>
<p>The climate of Swan River has already been noticed, and I
shall therefore allude here only to that of New South Wales. The
summer at Sydney is often excessively sultry, the weather, during
the prevalence of a "hot wind," being more oppressive than can be
imagined. At this time of the year also, the sand and dust rise
in such clouds, as almost to suffocate one; but from the intense
heat and nature of the soil, it is in vain to water the streets,
as they almost instantly become dry again: besides which, as
fresh water is not over abundant, salt water would have to be
substituted. If those who planned the town had laid out all the
streets of sufficient width for a row of trees on each side, it
would have been a great advantage; but we English are far behind
the French and Dutch in these matters.</p>
<p>A "hot wind" (north-west), resembles the Sirocco, or rather
the Kamsin, and sometimes prevails for two or three days
together. I recollect once having experienced one for four days,
but this is seldom the case. The heat caused by it was enough to
melt that fire eating beast the Salamander!</p>
<p>The theory of this wind is not at all understood, for the
assertion that its intense and peculiar heat is caused by its
passage over immense deserts in the interior, cannot be proved
until it has been ascertained that such deserts exist! **</p>
<p class="foot">[** Oxley, who had penetrated farther inland than
any other traveller, came to the conclusion, that the interior is
a vast marsh: some have decided that it is a sandy desert; and
others that it forms an extensive lake! a <i>slight</i>
difference of opinion!]</p>
<p>I had often thought the hot winds might possibly be caused by
the fires which prevail so constantly throughout the colony, but
have been informed by several old and respectable settlers that
such is most certainly not the case; I therefore know not in what
way to account for them, as they occur also in Van Dieman's Land!
Now to reach that island they must cross Bass' Straits, and pass
over a surface of seventy or eighty miles of water; but I never
met with any person who had remarked one at a greater distance
from land than nine or ten miles; and in consequence am inclined
to believe, that the north-wester which blows in Tasmania may not
be the same that passes over New Holland! One objection against
the warmth being caused by the fires is, that if this were the
case, <i>every</i> wind, except from the eastward, would be
charged with this superabundance of caloric: yet notwithstanding
this, I cannot but still be of opinion, that the climate must, in
some measure, be affected by them! for I remember perfectly well,
that during the last (in January, 1833), which reached to within
six or eight miles of Sydney, and extended all over the country,
the air was tolerably oppressive; and in exposing myself to its
influence, I might just as well have been placed before the mouth
of a furnace.</p>
<p>It does not follow, because a hot wind happened to blow at
that particular time, that it was caused by the conflagration;
but it seems to me impossible that a great extent of country can
be almost enveloped in flames, without this producing for the
time a material influence upon the climate. In running along the
coast to southward of Port Jackson, vast columns of smoke were
perceived as far as the eye could reach inland, and afforded
irrefragable proof that the fires must sometimes extend over a
prodigious tract of country, so that a person would naturally be
led to believe they would heat the air to even an extraordinary
degree! * When that disastrous fire at Mirimachi (in America)
took place, the heat was felt at a distance which almost
surpassed the bounds of credibility; and although I grant that it
was more terrible in its effects than any which has taken place
in New South Wales, yet, judging from it, the ignition of the
forests of the latter <i>may</i>, perhaps <i>must</i>, cause a
great increase of temperature throughout the country.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* The fires about Sydney, and to a distance of
forty miles, were so serious last summer that much fencing was
destroyed; and in some places twenty or thirty men were employed
to extinguish the conflagration, particularly near the grain,
which was ready for the sickle.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** In Ghilan, one of the Caspian provinces, a
hot wind sometimes suddenly springs up from the south, lasts 24
hours, and is followed by a gale from north-east, but there are
no satisfactory means of accounting for it.]</p>
<p>I have not the most distant idea of attempting to establish
any theory of my own with respect to the above point, there being
no data on which to found one; but in noticing the climate, I
have considered myself bound not to omit mentioning a
circumstance of such consequence. It is a grand and magnificent
spectacle to observe the fire spreading itself on the sides and
summits of the mountains: on the Blue Mountains, when this was
the case, the effect was similar to that caused by a volcano!</p>
<p>It sometimes happens that a change takes place from a hot wind
to a "brickfielder," on which occasions the thermometer has been
known to fall, within half an hour, <i>upwards of fifty
degrees!</i> That is to say, from above 100 deg. to 50 deg.! A
brickfielder is a southerly wind, and takes its local name from
the circumstance of its blowing over, and bringing into the town,
the flames of a large brickfield: it is nearly as detestable as
the hot wind. More than once during last summer (1832-33), the
thermometer rose to 98 deg. in the shade, and 88 deg. in the
coolest room in the house. Yet such is the atmosphere of this
country, that with the thermometer at 96 deg. in the shade, I
have ridden fifty miles between sunrise and sunset without being
particularly incommoded!</p>
<p>The winter is represented to be delightful, and the little I
saw of it induced me to consider it superior to that of Florence.
The temperature, during that season, is seldom below 50 deg. Some
writers have pretended to form registers of the temperature,
number of rainy days, etc., etc.; but in such a peculiar climate
these can never be correct, unless the result of observations
during a long series of years.</p>
<p>From the peculiar configuration of Illawarra I am led to
believe the climate is superior to that of Sydney; for the abrupt
range of mountains behind must screen the district from the hot
winds, which necessarily pass over it at too great a height to
injure the vegetation; and it is likewise refreshed by the cool
breezes which blow from the sea, so that it can seldom experience
the extremity of heat.</p>
<p>To the southward of Illawarra the climate is better calculated
for agricultural purposes than that of Sydney itself; nor, from
all I have heard of it, do I believe droughts are so common
there.</p>
<p>In the elevated parts of Argyle, and at Bathurst, the heats of
summer are less intense than at the capital, but in the winter
the cold is felt rather severely; in the former district more
than one settler told me that, at times, the temperature was as
low as in England during the same season: this however, can
scarcely be the case. The climate of these districts is extremely
healthy; hot winds do not prevail so often, nor are they so much
felt there as at Sydney. Between the last and the Hunter's River
district the distinction is trifling, the principal difference
being, that at the latter, the maize is liable to be cut up by
night frosts.</p>
<p>I am not aware if the elevation of the Corborn Comleroy has
been hitherto ascertained, but judging imperfectly from the
country over which we travelled, it must be rather considerable;
and certainly if Mount Boorooan be 6,000 feet above the level of
the sea, the plains cannot be much under 2000. While there I
found the heat far less oppressive than near the capital, and on
the Hunter.</p>
<p>At Port Macquarrie hot winds prevail as elsewhere, and the
climate appears to vary very little, if at all, from that of
Sydney.</p>
<p>The seasons in the different districts are naturally
influenced by the localities, and in the Bathurst country, and
towards Lake George, both 2,000 feet above the sea, with a
climate which (with the exception of the droughts) is merely a
modification of that of the milder parts of England, they are
three weeks later than at Sydney. The whole of New Holland, as
far as it is known, is liable to droughts, and these constitute
the principal, perhaps only decided objection to the climate. The
last, distinguished by the title of "The Great Drought," lasted
<i>four years</i>, (1826, 27, 28, 29); and many of the settlers
were nearly ruined by it. One gentleman is said to have lost five
consecutive crops. The longest period, during which no rain fell,
was <i>six months and thirteen days</i>; but in one part of the
colony only a few light and trifling showers fell during eight
months.</p>
<p>Sometimes tremendous hail-storms occur, and hailstones have
fallen as large as <i>pullet's eggs</i>, killing lambs and
poultry, and cutting up the corn most completely. One of these
took place in Argyle in October 1832, answering to our April, and
some idea may be formed of the havoc it must have caused, by the
knowledge that many of the hailstones were two inches and a half
in length, and one inch in diameter. Its effects were felt over a
tract of country five miles in width, but of what length I cannot
say; and the direction was from a part of the colony very little
located. Some of the sheep were badly injured, and birds killed;
and the trees were cut, or broken, in a very remarkable
manner.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Last April, (1833) there fell hailstones
<i>seven inches and a half</i> in circumference! Many of the
sheep were slain, and the tobacco crops were destroyed.]</p>
<p>The last earthquake happened in December. 1813; it created
alarm, but did no damage.</p>
<p>A circumstance respecting this colony, which must excite
astonishment in every one, is the truly wonderful way in which
the vegetation will recover itself after a drought. Land so
completely burnt up that not a blade of grass is visible, will,
within a few days after rain, become covered with a verdure most
refreshing to the eye, and doubtless not the less acceptable to
the cattle and sheep. Of the former some thousands perished
during the "great drought."</p>
<p>As a general observation, I may say of the climate of New
South Wales, that it is undoubtedly healthy, but more adapted to
some constitutions than others; and an important advantage is,
that the invalid, by removing from one district to another, may
select a climate according to the temperature he requires; at the
same time I by no means agree in conferring upon it the
unqualified praises bestowed by a writer of some note; nor do I
pretend to assert that people are longer lived, or more healthy,
than in our own beautiful island; the climate of which, despite
its vicissitudes, is probably, every thing considered, equal in
point of salubrity to that of any country I have visited. The
finest of climates is that of the neighbourhood of the Tropics,
<i>at a distance from land</i>: for what can be more delightful
than to course rapidly along in clear weather, with a brisk,
trade wind, imparting a delicious freshness to the atmosphere,
and causing a feeling of vigour, and an elevation of spirits,
seldom experienced to such an extent on shore?</p>
<p>If that of New South Wales has many excellencies, it has also
its imperfections; and the emigrant will find that, however
adapted for the agriculturists, there are several circumstances
which, if fairly considered, will tend to reduce it,
notwithstanding the perfectibility attributed to it by writers,
to a nearer level with that of our own.</p>
<p>There is a striking resemblance between New Holland, Persia,
and Southern Africa, not only in regard to climate, but in the
deficiency of water, which, in each of them, is the most scanty
boon of nature. It is only immediately after heavy rains that
they appear to be well irrigated; then, indeed, a thousand
streams rush down the mountains, every little hollow, or rainworn
channel, becomes the bed of a rapid torrent, and every little
rivulet is swelled at once to a considerable size. Droughts of
long continuance too are not uncommon; and I have no doubt that
on enquiry a still greater resemblance would be found.</p>
<p>To conclude this subject, if we take the whole of the eastern
half of New Holland, there will be found every description of
climate from the vicinity of the equator to 40 degrees of
latitude: but if we select any particular portion of it, our own
climate, inconstant as it is, will not perhaps lose by the
comparison.</p>
<p>Such is a very imperfect sketch of a country, whose climate
has been extolled as far superior to what is actually the case;
and whose aspect, the forlorn grandeur of which is entirely
peculiar to these regions, is so utterly different from that of
every other country, that the author is unable to find one with
which to compare it.</p>

<p><span class="aa">The</span> capital of Australia stands partly
in a narrow valley or ravine, and partly on the sides of it, and
extends also some distance beyond, occupying a space of about a
square mile: the site might have been better selected, as it is
rather difficult at present to get at many of the wharves. The
streets are laid out with regularity, and are of good width as
mere streets; but they ought to have been broad enough to admit
of a row of trees on each side (as I have before remarked), which
would have imparted some beauty to the town, and been of great
advantage to the inhabitants. There is no person who has visited
the Cape of Good Hope, the Mauritius, Martinique, and numerous
other foreign colonial towns, who will not agree with myself,
that they are laid out with infinitely more taste, and regard to
comfort, than our own.</p>
<p>In some of the streets the houses have a space of twelve feet
of garden between them and the part of the road appropriated to
pedestrians, but these are not the most frequented or the most
respectable: and very probably, when large houses usurp the place
of the cottages, these miniature gardens will be turned into
court yards, or concealed by the building. If George-street,
which is a mile in length, had been planted, the effect would
have been fine, and the heat lessened. Some of the houses and
cottages are built with great taste. At the town the harbour is
about a mile and a half broad, and towards the entrance the width
increases to nearly three miles. The shores are bold, often
abrupt and rocky, and composed of a sandstone that forms a good
material for building, as it becomes indurated by exposure.</p>
<p>The harbour contains several islands, and may be said to
extend fourteen miles from the sea, for the Paramatta river is
but an arm or branch of it; there are, also, a great number of
bays, inlets, and creeks, which contribute materially to the
general appearance of the prospects.</p>
<p>The country on both sides of the harbour is very irregular,
but more rugged on the north shore; on this side, also, there are
but three or four houses, and the surface is concealed by forest
as far as the distant hills: on the south side there are several
spots which have been got into cultivation at great cost and
labour, and in process of time these will tend to render less
conspicuous the monotony which at present reigns over the
landscape.</p>
<p>Port Jackson may well be termed one of the noblest of
harbours; and although the country around is not worthy of the
high encomiums which have so lavishly been bestowed upon it,
there are various points of view quite entitled to the admiration
of any traveller.</p>
<p>There is still a vast portion of forest in the immediate
neighbourhood of Sydney, and a very long period may be expected
to elapse ere it can be cleared off; for the returns would not
repay the expense of cultivating such a soil as that found in
this part of the colony. It is in patches that the good soil is
seen, and some spots on the Paramatta river are particularly
fertile; but more commonly sand and iron-stone prevail, with
frequently a mixture of the two. As to the fine land at Botany
Bay, I know not what has become of it: Banks's Meadows still
remain, but the rich soil seen by him and Cook seems to have
disappeared, if it ever existed. Sydney is increasing with such
rapidity, that fast as the houses are run up, they are frequently
taken before they are quite completed! It is, therefore, not to
be wondered at that house-rent is so high; and if it were not for
this, I know of no town in England (taking into consideration the
absence of taxes), that could be compared with it in cheapness of
living, as the necessaries of life are uncommonly reasonable.</p>
<p>When I left Sydney an auctioneer was erecting a house, with
auction-rooms, etc. the estimated cost of which was
4,500<i>l</i>., and will, most probably, exceed 5,000<i>l</i>.!
Two partners expended 8,000<i>l</i>. upon another house, in which
they established a store; and another person has raised a huge
and unsightly range of distilleries and breweries, said to have
cost 16,000<i>l</i>. This will convey to the reader some idea of
the extent to which building is carried.</p>
<p>The expense of a cottage, forty-five feet by thirty-five, with
six rooms, is 530<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>There is an excellent market, well supplied with provisions of
every description; the prices in January, 1833, were as

<p>The most expensive article of food is potatoes, which were
from ten to fifteen shillings per hundred weight, and seldom fit
to eat at any price. They grow well at Bathurst and other places,
but would not pay the carriage to Sydney: however, they are
imported from New Zealand and Hobart Town.</p>
<p>Water is unfortunately scarce, the trifling spring which rises
in the town affording a very scanty supply; and although the
quantity has been increased by a small stream conducted by pipes
from a distance, there is still a great deficiency of this
essential requisite; which, as the population increases, will be
the case in a still greater degree, unless reservoirs or tanks
are constructed. The well-water is seldom fit to drink.</p>
<p>The number of public-houses in the Australian capital may
cause some little surprise, when the reader is informed that they
amount to <i>one hundred and ninety-seven</i>; besides which, the
houses where spirits are surreptitiously sold are believed to be
nearly as numerous. Drinking, amongst the lower orders, is
certainly carried on here to an extent little known elsewhere!
Possibly some blame may attach to the climate, as it assuredly
promotes a predisposition to drought in the human subject, and
also to the bad quality, and small quantity of the water; but at
the same time I am much inclined to suspect that the aforesaid
classes, in Sydney, are inclined to indulge, whenever they have
it in their power, solely from habits of drunkenness. The
quantity of spirits imported between the 1st of December, 1831,
and the 1st of December, 1832, was 352,549 gallons; and of wine
104,406 gallons. The quantity of spirits exported was 29,256
gallons; and of wine 37,543 gallons: but at least 11,000 gallons
of gin were distilled in the colony, of which none was exported.
Consequently there remained in the colony 334,283 gallons of
spirits; and 66,858 of wine. What quantity is actually consumed
annually I did not learn, but, compared with the population, it
must have been very great.</p>
<p>According to information which I derived from the police
office, Sydney contains 13,000 inhabitants, 400 military, and
2,000 convicts, in all 15,400. This includes all the inhabitants
of the district, but those who reside out of the town are not
numerous. The entire population of the colony probably exceeds
60,000, An extract from Mr. Bulwer's speech in the House of
Commons will convey some idea of the impracticability of
ascertaining correctly the sum total:&mdash;"In regard to the
population of New South Wales," he observes, "there seems to
exist a most singular uncertainty. According to the returns of
1828 the amount was 36,598. Out of this population 15,666 were
convicts, leaving 20,930 free inhabitants. But, by referring to
the population returns of preceding years, it is found that, in
1824, the population was 33,595; so that it had only increased
about 3,000 in five years. Now the population in these five years
had, according to our lists of persons transported, been
increased by convicts alone 10,005. To make, therefore, the
census of 1828 correct, the free inhabitants must have decreased
in these five years by about 5,000; a proposition perfectly
absurd. In this same year of 1828, Mr. Huskisson stated the total
population to be 49,000; it could not have suddenly decreased
between the returns and this assertion by 13,000. Take, then,
this calculation as correct (since in regard to the number of
convicts stated, viz. 15,666, there could not be any error), the
free population would then have amounted to 33,334. The colonists
themselves state it much higher."</p>
<p>As in all other communities we perceive various grades or
ranks in society, so likewise the same is observed at Sydney,
though with more variations; I shall limit them to five
divisions, viz. government officers, settlers and merchants, free
persons generally (not being of either of the above classes),
emancipists and convicts. As to the subdivisions of the fourth
class, I consider them absurd in themselves, and liable only to
wound the feelings of those concerned, without imparting any
information to the reader. The child of an emancipist ought to be
considered equally entitled to all the claims of respect and
attention as the offspring of a person who came to the colony
perfectly free; for it is sufficiently painful for the parent to
hate his sins visited upon himself, without having, in addition,
a stigma cast upon his children. I therefore look upon it as most
illiberal to attempt to establish any distinction between the
latter and that class to which their birth or education would
have entitled them, if they had been in the colony under more
auspicious circumstances.</p>
<p>There are in and about Sydney so many families of
respectability, that they constitute a society extensive enough
for any one, who, not wishing to be eternally engaged in what is
termed dissipation, is contented with a moderate share of it; and
as I experienced much attention from several of them, I can
answer for inhospitality not being a trait in the character of
the gentry of this town. Much has been said about the "envy,
hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness" of the society; but
proneness to scandal and detraction are so universal, that it
would be difficult to say where this propensity does not exist:
the inhabitants of these colonies are not worse than the rest of
the world, and therefore ought not to receive more than their
share of the blame.</p>
<p>Of the hospitality of the settlers, or those who reside out of
Sydney, I have already made mention, and shall therefore only
add, that go where I would, I was received in a manner which
would have led any one to suppose me an old acquaintance of the
family rather than a mere casual visitor. There are many
thankless persons who say that the settlers are, as a matter of
course, naturally glad to see strangers, and that this is the
sole reason why they receive them in such a friendly manner. I
can only tell these ingrates that they have quite enough to do,
and also to think of, without devoting their time and attention
to every traveller who may chance to put up at their houses.</p>
<p>Emancipists are those who have become free in consequence of
the termination of their sentence, or been pardoned; and some of
them have realized very considerable property.</p>
<p>Persons holding a "ticket of leave" are convicts, who, in
consequence of good conduct, are made, in a great measure, free;
for though they may not quit a particular district without the
permission of the governor, yet in it they are at liberty to act
to all intents and purposes as if pardoned&mdash;that is to say,
so long as they continue to behave themselves properly.</p>
<p>Lately a great change has taken place respecting them, for by
a recent order no person sentenced to transportation can receive
a pardon or "ticket of leave," "unless such person, if
transported for seven years, shall have served four; if
transported for fourteen years, shall have served six; or, if
transported for life, shall have served eight years of labour;"
and <i>no ticket-of-leave person can hold property</i>, nor can
he sue or be sued in a court of law! Now, as numbers of them
possess property, the point is, to whom does the same belong?
This question had not been decided at my departure.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Several other new regulations have recently
been established, which render the situation of a convict
somewhat less agreeable than formerly.]</p>
<p>Some of the ticket of leave men are employed as constables,
others as overseers; in short they hold all kinds of
situations.</p>
<p>The number of convicts ** in the colony, at the census of
1828, amounted to 13,927 males, and 1,504 females, making a total
of 15,431. The numbers arrived since the census are as

<p class="foot">[** The appellation of "Convict" is rarely used
in the Colonies, except officially, "Prisoner," or "Government
Man," being substituted as less offensive; and for "Convict
Servant," the term of "Assigned Servant" is used.]</p>
<p>In 1832 there were granted 1,002 certificates of freedom, and
1,162 tickets of leave; and 5,515 convicts were assigned, or
transferred, to private service alone.</p>
<p>At a fair calculation, I shall not be far out in stating the
total amount of convicts, in January last, at from 21,000 to
23,000.</p>
<p>The greatest number of servants employed by any one individual
is <i>one hundred and thirty</i>; and by one family, (father and
two sons) <i>one hundred and seventy</i>; notwithstanding which,
it is doubtful if they are not in want of more. People in England
naturally wonder how this can be, when the farmers there, however
large their farms, require, comparatively speaking, so few. They
are not probably aware, that in these colonies, the respectable
settlers have artificers or mechanics of every description, and
that almost every article is made on their farms, with the
exception of clothing; as it would cause most serious
inconvenience to be obliged to send a considerable distance for
every thing they wanted. They have also sometimes, in addition to
their flocks and herds, several large establishments to look
after. Every thing considered, it does still appear extraordinary
that any settler can require such a host of servants. However,
such is the case; and as fast as prison ships arrive, the
convicts are immediately assigned, but the supply is still
greatly inferior to the demand.</p>
<p>The weekly rations of the convict are 12lbs, of wheat, or
9lbs. of flour, or 3½ lbs. of maize and 9lbs. of wheat, or 7 lbs.
of second flour; 7 lbs. of beef or mutton, or 4½ lbs. of salt
pork; 2 oz. of salt; 2 oz. of soap.</p>
<p>The clothing to which they are entitled consists of 2 frocks
or jackets; 3 pair of shoes of stout and durable leather; 3
shirts; 2 pair of trowsers; 1 hat or cap.</p>
<p>No person can diminish the rations or allowance of clothing as
ordered by the government regulations.</p>
<p>Some of the settlers allow their servants tea and sugar,
others milk instead; and many give them tobacco, and,
occasionally spirits: these are indulgencies which can be
withheld at pleasure.</p>
<p>The expense of a convict servant who has no wages (some of the
best of them receive a gratuity annually) is about £10 per annum;
but there are settlers who contrive so as not to let it exceed £7
or £8: however the sum of £10 is more correct as an average.</p>
<p>Convicts will sometimes work quite as well as our labourers at
home, though, as might be expected they are also pretty often
troubled with the <i>vis inertiæ;</i> and I have known them
receive their usual allowance of wheat, and then give a moiety of
it to a comrade on condition that he returned the other in flour,
being too lazy to grind it themselves. One gentleman tried the
experiment of enclosing for his people a piece of ground, and
giving them seeds that they might be enabled to supply themselves
with vegetables: the seeds were sown, but the garden was shortly
after abandoned, and the fence used for fire-wood, as the men
preferred remaining without vegetables to being at the trouble of
cultivating them. A gentleman on the Hunter also tried this plan
and entirely succeeded; so that here we have an instance of the
effects of good management: it is certainly pretty evident
throughout the colony, that while some settlers manage their
servants uncommonly well, others, on the contrary, completely
spoil them, and entirely through the want of system.</p>
<p>The huts of the convicts are seldom notorious for cleanliness
or comfort, and the inmates are not unfrequently mote numerous
than those of an Irish cabin: the last that I inspected contained
a multitude of noisy parrots, intended for sale; pet kangaroos
and opossums, with a variety of kangaroo dogs, grey-hounds, and
sheep-dogs: on the fire was a huge boiler filled with the flesh
of a kangaroo, and close by were suspended the hind-quarters of
another of these animals; in one corner was a large pan of milk,
in another, a number of skins partially dried; while, a few feet
from the ground, were the filthy bed-places or cribs of the
people themselves.</p>
<p>The gentleman to whom I have alluded above (on the Hunter),
has erected neat cottages, in each of which reside a certain
number of his people, and there is a piece of garden attached to
them, filled, when I was on the spot, with vegetables and
flowers. Indeed his entire establishment does credit to his
energy and exertions.</p>
<p>One of the regulations respecting servants, <i>if acted up
to</i>, is very judicious:&mdash;"In assigning convicts,
especially labourers applicable to husbandry, preference will be
given to <i>new settlers</i>; to persons residing in the country,
and to those of good moral character, who pay due attention to
their servants. Another regulation is, "No convict will be
assigned to his, or her, wife, or husband, although holding a
ticket of leave." This must have been introduced lately, as not
long since it certainly was common enough to see convicts
assigned to their wives, who had come out free, and at the same
time brought with them the unlawful gains of the villanies of
themselves and husbands, whereby the sentence of the former was
rendered in a great measure nugatory, as the woman, though her
husband was ostensibly her menial, did not of course, look upon
him in the light of one; a manifest injustice to the other
prisoners, who had not their wives with them, or were unmarried;
consequently, if the above regulation be peremptory, it is a very
proper one.</p>
<p>Great improvement might be made (in both colonies) with
reference to the assignment of the prisoners, so as to distribute
the more useful impartially to all the settlers, without
considering who or what the latter are, provided they are persons
with whom the Government have no reason to find fault in respect
to their treatment of their servants. Some of the convicts are
absolutely worse than useless, especially a London pick-pocket,
than whom a more worthless, good-for-nothing blackguard is hardly
to be found. This alone will show that it is a matter of no
trivial consequence to procure men who are acquainted with some
trade, or are, at least, available as labourers.</p>
<p>If a convict prove refractory a single magistrate can order
him fifty lashes; but a severer punishment can only be inflicted
by two or more; and no magistrate can punish his own
servants.</p>
<p>Convicts are also punished by being compelled to work in
chains or irons upon the roads (they are called "road gangs");
but in the event of their committing an act which constitutes
felony, they are tried in a court of justice, and, if not hanged,
are sent to a penal settlement. This last sentence is held in no
small dread by many of them, as it does not at all coincide with
their ideas of comfort; and some have preferred even death
itself, as will be more fully explained when noticing this
subject in the general observations on Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>Moreton Bay and Norfolk Island are, at present, the only penal
settlements; at these places the rations are not so ample as in
the colony generally, and those who are sent there are compelled
to do rather more work than is agreeable to them; but neither
this award, nor that of being in the chain-gangs, is at all
commensurate with their crimes.</p>
<p>When they conduct themselves with propriety, and can obtain
from their masters a good character for honesty and diligence,
even those who are for life are certain of receiving a ticket of
leave, long before the expiration of the term of their
transportation.</p>
<p>As to the females, it is a melancholy fact, but not the less
true, that far the greater proportion are utterly irreclaimable,
being the most worthless and abandoned of human beings! No
kindness can conciliate them, nor any indulgence render them
grateful; and it is admitted by every one, that they are, taken
as a body, infinitely worse than the males! They are punished by
having their heads shaved, by solitary confinement, and by bread
and water diet; they care for neither of the two first, and not
so much as might be expected for the last. Good conduct entitles
them to the same privileges as the men.</p>
<p>In order to show the opinions entertained by some of the
convicts, as regards the colony, I will give an extract from one
of the sundry letters which I have read, written by them to their
friends in England, using the writer's own language and
punctuation, but altering the spelling. He requests that his wife
will come out, and bring their children with her, and then
proceeds as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I am perfectly well satisfied with my situation thanks be to
God that has placed me under those that does not despise a
prisoner. No, my love, I am (not?) treated as a prisoner but as a
free man, there is no one to say a wrong word to me. I have good
usage, plenty of good meat, and clothes with easy work. I have
362 sheep to mind, either of our lads could do it with ease. The
best of men was shepherds. Jacob served for his wife, yea and for
a wife did he keep sheep and so will I, and my love we shall be
more happy here than ever we should be at home if happiness is to
be found on the earth. Don't fail to come out I never thought
this country what I have found it. I did expect to be in servile
bondage and to be badly used but I am better off this day than
half the people in England, and I would not go back to England if
any one would pay my passage. England has the name of a free
country and tins is a bond country, but shame my friends and
countrymen where is your boasted freedom. Look round you, on
every side there is distress, rags, want, and all are in one
sorrowful state of want. Happiness and prosperity has long taken
their flight from Albion's once happy isle."</p>
<p>He then alludes to the low price of provisions, and
adds&mdash;"Except you live in a town you have no rent to pay,
for each man builds his own house, no tithes, no poor-rates, and
no taxes of any kind. And this is bondage is it?" There are some
other amusing remarks in this original composition, but the above
will suffice to show that convicts lead not always the unhappy
life they are supposed to do, unless through their own bad
conduct. The writer of the above letter bears such an excellent
character that his master has sent to England for his wife and
family, with the intention of trying to be of some use to them.
Those employed at the stock-stations have little to do save to
ride about and look after the cattle, or sheep; indeed, much of
their time is passed in hunting kangaroos, or emus, and a most
independent kind of life they seem to lead, as indeed I have
already shown.</p>
<p>Bush-rangers are convicts who have escaped into the "bush,"
preferring a life of independence and plunder to one of labour
and honesty. In the neighbourhood of Sydney they abounded in 1829
and 1830; but some of the most desperate were shot by the
constabulary and mounted police, or taken and hanged; the rewards
held out for their apprehensions being such as to induce all
persons interested to use their utmost exertions to capture
them.</p>
<p>There are moralists who consider it a most heinous sin to set
one thief to catch another; but with every possible deference for
their opinions on this head, I must certainly differ with them;
for much good has arisen in both colonies from the adoption of
this system; complete bands of robbers having been broken up
entirely, in consequence of the rewards offered on the part of
the respective governments being so considerable, as to induce
the bush-rangers to betray each other. A person who captures or
assists in the capture (alive or dead) of any bush-ranger,
especially designated in the government proclamations, which are
issued on particular occasions, receives the sum of one hundred
pounds; in addition to which, if a convict, he obtains an
<i>unconditional</i> pardon, together with a passage to England;
if a free man he gets a grant of land. Previously the pardon was
conditional, so that the risk outweighed the chances of reward,
for the other convicts were certain, sooner or later, to avenge
their late comrade on those who, by their zeal and activity, had
been instrumental in his capture, and thereby rendered themselves
obnoxious. Under the present arrangement, the risk is not
incurred, as the person who is pardoned may proceed forthwith to
England. It must, however, be understood, that it is not for the
apprehension or destruction of the mere <i>canaille</i> of the
bush-rangers that such rewards are held out, but only for those
who are particularly specified; these are always men who, by the
magnitude and boldness of their depredations have become of
considerable notoriety.</p>
<p>Robberies in the "bush" are <i>remarkably</i> few in number,
and <i>deliberate</i> murders of such rare occurrence as to be
exceedingly uncommon; when an unfortunate man has been killed, it
has generally, perhaps always, happened when the robbers were
attacked or resisted.</p>
<p>At a distance from the capital, the precautions which are
taken in England to secure houses from intruders, are not
attended to. While up the country, I constantly slept with both
door and window open, and feared only an unwelcome visit from
some lengthy snake, or unsightly flying fox or vampire bat.</p>
<p>Some persons have written from Sydney, informing their friends
in England that so common is burglary there, that they are under
the necessity of sending all their plate, and other valuables, to
the Bank, so that they may be in a place of safety! This is not
the case; in fact, the assertion is absurd. Street-robberies, in
some of the worst parts of the town (the resort of every
description of profligate characters), are common enough, as
might be expected; but to say that house-breaking is so frequent
is a most ridiculous exaggeration. Highway robberies, within
thirty miles of Sydney, are certainly more common than is
agreeable to the solitary traveller, but they are chiefly
confined to the plundering of drays; and I strongly surmise that
the robbery does not always happen without some slight collusion
on the part of the drivers.</p>
<p>It would be no bad plan to hang up all receivers of stolen
goods; these wretches, who are ever the most cowardly and
dastardly of men, and who, though afraid to commit a robbery
themselves, are glad enough to profit by the villany of others,
being once got rid of, there would no longer exist that great
incentive to pilfer.</p>
<p>It was reported by a convict that a number of runaways had
established themselves at a spot in the interior, where they had
erected houses, and formed a regular community! In consequence of
this information an officer was sent with a party to seek for the
supposed settlement, but returned without having succeeded. The
aforesaid convict declares that the officer did not proceed far
enough; whether, therefore, it exists or not, must still remain a
doubtful point. Supposing the man's statement to be correct, it
would be highly interesting to know what kind of government has
been established among a set of such lawless beings.</p>
<p>When it is borne in mind that the colony of New South Wales
has been established only 45 years, the progress it has made must
appear extraordinary; and the imports and exports, with the rapid
increase in the revenue, will show the great advances it has made
in a commercial point of view.</p>

<p>The estimated charge for the clergy and school establishment
is £20,471, and the total estimated expenditure for 1833,
£110,252.</p>
<p>The breed of horses is rapidly improving in New South Wales,
racers having been imported from England, and Arabs from India;
and there are also two fine animals of the Cleveland breed. Of
the true dray horse, however, I saw few good specimens; indeed,
with the exception of the two Clevelands, I never heard of a pure
cart horse being in the colony; but some of the crosses are
admirably adapted for the climate of Sydney, and many of the
carriage-horses are likewise of a fine description. Those for the
saddle will endure a wonderful deal of fatigue if properly
attended to; even during the hottest part of the year, with the
thermometer, at times, as high as 96 deg. in the shade, I rode
the same animal fifty miles daily for three days together, and
that through rather a rugged country, and for some distance over
mountains. But all the colonial horses "will go through a vast
deal of work; and they would last much longer, if it were not for
the absurd plan that has been adopted, of breaking them in for
the saddle, or for harness, while so very young, a common
practice throughout the country. They are sometimes ridden, or
driven, fifty or sixty miles within the course of less than nine
hours, although little more than two years old: besides, they are
often turned out when the journey is finished, to pick up
whatever scanty herbage they may be able to find; or as a jocular
friend of mine observed, "they get a kick and a bucket of water,"
a fare with which I would rather dispense. They have decreased so
much in value that a very good one may be purchased for £35., and
a very tolerable one for £15 or £20. There are settlers who
possess from fifty to two hundred horses (the latter is an
unusual number), but the proportion of those really good is much
smaller than it ought to be, provided proper attention had been
paid to them.</p>
<p>So far as my slight knowledge of natural history goes, it is
agreed that the horse retains a most extraordinary recollection
of any place to which it has once been. In these colonies this is
carried to a degree almost beyond credence: for instance, a
person proceeding through the "Bush" to a place where his horse
had once been, and chancing to lose himself, has only to give the
animal the rein, when although there is neither path or track, it
will frequently find the way: some horses will invariably do so;
and it may with truth be said, that, in this respect, they
sometimes exhibit an instinct superior even to the boasted reason
of man.</p>
<p>While on a visit at the Valley of Mulgoa, I witnessed an
instance of retentive memory in a mare belonging to an officer
who was at the same house: it got loose, found its way to the
Warragamba, and then proceeded through a forest to the habitation
of a gentleman on whom its owner had called once six months
before, and three miles from the house where he was staying. The
animal was tracked, and had passed the river at the precise spot,
which was very rugged and rocky, where it had previously crossed,
and thence had reached the house.</p>
<p>There are complaints to which horses are subject in England
which are unknown in New South Wales: the glanders <i>par ex</i>.
has never made its appearance, but the strangles, or a complaint
analogous to it, has been lately introduced, if I mistake not
from Timor. Greasy heels are rarely, if ever, seen, and it really
would appear to be almost confined to England, for I never
remarked it abroad except in France, where I once saw eight
horses (in two stage-coaches at Boulogne), not one of which was
free from the malady; but it turned out that they had all been
imported.</p>
<p>Races were established some time since, though hitherto with
no great <i>éclat</i>; however, great improvements were in
contemplation. A new race course has been formed, which will be
of some advantage, as the old one was one of the worst ever
seen.</p>
<p>Cattle have multiplied prodigiously; hundreds, perhaps
thousands, are now roaming wild in the forests, and as might
naturally be expected they are of a very mixed description, some
being of a superior kind, but the greater number much
crossed.</p>
<p>The largest herd, as far as I could learn, owned by one
individual, is 4,000; another gentleman had more, but never knew
the total amount, as no small number of them were completely
wild. He is supposed to have lost nearly 2,000 of them during the
"great drought."</p>
<p>Although the price of meat is so low, those who breed cattle
contrive to clear considerable sums by them; and, by reference to
the "exports," it will be seen that a large quantity of meat is
salted. The perfect curing is not yet fully understood, and
consequently the commanders of vessels and others object to
provisions salted in the colony: the hams and tongues are
certainly very indifferent. The colonial salt <i>is said</i> not
to be adapted for the curing of meat: it <i>is certain</i> this
is an error, for I have eaten beef cured with it, and although
two years in cask, of excellent quality.</p>
<p>One remarkable, I had almost said unaccountable, feature in
this colony is the truly singular manner in which the cattle
contrive to preserve their condition during a long continuance of
dry weather. In the six months from July 1832 to January 1833, so
little rain fell that the country was completely parched up; and
in consequence of the grass being accidentally ignited, not a
blade was to be found within some forty miles of Sydney.
Nevertheless, the cattle by browsing upon the tender shoots of
various plants, though they were not overburdened with fat, were
yet in general tolerably sleek, and the oxen quite able to get
through their work; while the cows afforded a fair supply of milk
and butter. Even up to the time of my departure, early in
February, no rain of any consequence had fallen, so that, what
with the hot winds and great fires, the drought and the dust, one
could hardly breathe; but as I propose making a handsome fortune
by <i>transporting</i> the bones or relics, of St. Swithin, a
better supply of rain may be expected in future.</p>
<p>It is a common supposition that the ox is a clumsy animal; no
person would admit this to be the case, if he had once seen the
creature in a wild, or semi-wild state. There are few settlers
who have not witnessed the astonishing leaps it can take, in this
respect, appearing to excel even the horse; for I measured a
stock-yard fence rather more than six feet high, which was
cleared by one lately caught, with great apparent ease; although
from the trifling dimensions of the stock-yard, it had no
opportunity of increasing its impetus by a run. A common fence is
considered by the cattle as no impediment whatever to their
escape.</p>
<p>They all evince great dislike to the <i>aborigines</i>, and so
do many of the horses. A party were out once after wild oxen, and
had with them a native for a guide: the instant the latter was
perceived by the herd he was pursued, but was nimble enough to
climb a tree, where he remained, while they stood round and
watched him. Some time elapsed before the party were able to
extricate their sable friend, as the animals showed an
inclination to attack them whenever they advanced; but after some
man&oelig;uvring they at length succeeded.</p>
<p>When persons on horseback are seen by the half-wild cattle,
(those regularly branded by their respective owners, but only
driven at stated times into the enclosures,) the latter will
gallop in a body towards the strangers, with every appearance of
a determination to attack them. Whenever this occurs a person had
better stop, upon which they will make off, or stand and stare at
him until he has passed away. They more than once came up to us
in this manner, and on one occasion charged right through our
party of eleven persons, while we were somewhat scattered;
however, I never saw them attempt the smallest injury. When hard
driven it signifies little whether they are of the wild or
half-wild kinds, for they will attempt to gore both horse and
rider; and unless the former be a steady, sagacious beast, and
accustomed to such rough work, the chances are decidedly in
favour of his master getting some broken bones.</p>
<p>There is something highly exciting and amusing ill collecting
wild cattle: the nature of the country, the style in which both
horses and oxen will leap over the huge trunks always found
scattered about on the ground, and especially the clever way in
which a well trained horse will avoid coming in contact with a
tree, a circumstance rather liable to occur when going at full
speed, all this is extremely animating; and the more so from its
not always being unaccompanied by danger; the principal incentive
(with emulation) to engage in such a pastime as hunting. There
are convict stock-keepers who, when after cattle, would not only
astonish our fox-hunters, but if the country was at all difficult
to ride through, would, not improbably, leave them entirely in
the lurch.</p>
<p>While at Liverpool Plains I heard of a bullock that had been
taught to carry a stock-keeper in search of strayed cattle. The
man would ride a short distance, and then stop, upon which the
animal would low; if the herd were at hand they were sure to
answer; if otherwise, the man rode farther, and generally
succeeded in gaining his object. Of course this plan was adopted
only when in a forest, where a person was unable to see any
distance. The gentleman who related this singular incident, had
wished to purchase the animal, but the owner did not choose to
part with it: it died a short time previous to my excursion to
the plains.</p>

<p>Of sheep there may be had all the varieties, from the pure
Merino, or Saxon, to the most indifferent cross-breed, their wool
being from the finest to the most ordinary. As elsewhere they are
subject to scab and rot, the result as often of neglect or
injudicious treatment as of untoward circumstances. The three
largest flocks, of which I heard, amounted to 23,000, 20,000, and
15,000; and the united flocks of the ten principal growers of
wool, would most probably exceed 130,000. What may be the total
number of sheep in the colony, I have not the smallest idea, nor
do I imagine it would be an easy matter to ascertain: the
Australian Company alone are computed to have not less than
50,000. I should hardly think there were fewer than 450,000 shorn
last year; for the quantity of wool exported would give (at from
3 lbs. to 3½ lbs. a fleece) about 385,000, and a large quantity
of the coarser wools are manufactured into cloths in the colony;
one individual alone making not less than a thousand yards
weekly. Fleeces of the weight of 5 lbs. are not uncommon, and
some of <i>fair</i> wool weighed 7 lbs; but from 3 lbs. to 3½
lbs. appears to be the more usual average of those of a superior
quality. The fleeces of 7 lbs. were sold in the colony at fifteen
pence per pound. Not long since a settler, whose flocks were in
the Morumbidgee, was obliged to apply for permission to change
his grant in consequence of a most unprecedented event that
happened with respect to his sheep. The soil was impregnated with
saline matter, and the sheep were observed to eat it with the
greatest avidity; but, after a time, the ewes took to
<i>devouring the lambs as fast as they were dropped</i>; that is
to say, as soon as a lamb made its appearance, the ewes (not the
mother) would tear it to pieces and eat it! When this was made
known to the owner, he ordered a quantity of salt to be given to
the animals, which was incautiously placed in a heap at one spot,
for the instant it was perceived by them, they made a
simultaneous rush, and several of them were trampled to death. Of
1,400 lambs only 400 were saved; and, in so far as I could
discover, the loss occurred in consequence of the sheep not
having been supplied with salt. Many of the settlers appear
afraid that it would injure them; a great error, as is well known
to farmers in England. Lord Somerville attributes the great
health of his Merinos to the salt with which they are supplied,
and allows a ton annually to every hundred sheep; and in Spain
also the Merinos have salt; while in New South Wales thousands of
the sheep never see a grain from the beginning to the end of the
year.</p>
<p>Cachmere goats have been recently imported, and, as the
climate is so congenial, their hair will very likely form an
important article of exportation. The broad-tailed sheep might
also be introduced with advantage; in Thibet the fleece is
remarkably fine, and from its beauty and length is worked into
very fine shawls.</p>
<p>As any further observations that I may have to make on this
colony, will apply equally to Van Dieman's Land, I shall
introduce, in the next chapter, those which concern the latter
only, and afterwards conclude with those likely to be of use to
the emigrant in whichever colony he may decide upon locating
himself.</p>

<p><span class="aa">The</span> distance from Sydney to Hobart
Town is 650 miles, and the passage usually occupies eight or ten
days, though sometimes from twenty to thirty, but it has been
accomplished in less than ninety hours.</p>
<p>The advice recommended to the emigrant on his arrival at
Sydney is equally applicable to him on his reaching Hobart Town;
it would consequently be useless to repeat it: and the mode of
travelling in the "bush" is also the same as in New South
Wales.</p>
<p>Any person undecided in which colony he will finally establish
himself, could take his passage in a vessel bound to Sydney via
Hobart Town; as he would then have ample time, while the cargo
was discharging, to make every inquiry connected with the subject
of land: if he found that the colony answered his expectations he
could remain, or otherwise go on to New South Wales. If he
adopted this suggestion, it would be adviseable to make some
arrangement with the commander before he quits England, so as to
live on board while in harbour; for the expense on shore would be
very heavy. The above plan I should adopt myself without the
slightest hesitation. There are tracts of country in Van Dieman's
Land so imperfectly known, in consequence of the island having
been but partially explored, that it is very probable good land
may be discovered when least expected; at present, I really do
not know of any good unlocated land in an eligible situation,
unless there be some between the capital and Macquarrie Harbour,
which I have heard is the case. There are undoubtedly spots which
would form grants of 1,000 or 2,000 acres; but this is not the
kind of farm adapted for the wool-grower nor for the grazier,
unless there be a back run, which is not quite so likely to be
the case as in the more open forest country of New Holland. All
that I can say upon the subject, therefore, is, that the emigrant
will find it extremely difficult to secure land in such a
situation, and of such extent, as would benefit him to the degree
he has a right to expect, in exchanging his paternal soil for a
residence in so distant a country.</p>
<p>I shall now describe very briefly those parts of the island
which I visited; they are few in number, but want of time
prevented me from extending my little tour, nor am I sure that by
travelling farther I should have seen aught particularly worthy
of notice: even as it is, the reader will probably fancy I am
describing (with the exception of the Derwent) some portion of
New South Wales, unless he attends to the names of the places,
which are certainly sufficiently distinct not to deceive him very
easily.</p>
<p>New Town is a scattered village consisting of ten or twelve
houses, and is well situated on the right bank of the Derwent.
There is much land around in a state of cultivation, several
gardens with a different appearance from those spots of white
sand near the capital of the other colony, and it is altogether a
pretty vicinity. Besides being desirable as a residence, on
account of the respectability of those who live there, it is only
two miles from Hobart Town. On the road from it to the ferry,
seven miles farther, there are some good views of the river,
which I crossed; thence a ride of six miles through open forest
brought me to the Jordan, an inconsiderable stream, not far from
which is the township of Brighton, standing on a plain, with much
open, but very stony country, in the vicinity: on the whole I was
rather pleased with the situation of the place.</p>
<p>The route then led me through the Valley of Bagdad, which
though not the scene of Mirzah's Dream, was yet extremely pretty,
(I saw no flocks however), and the country generally to Green
Ponds, (an elegant name) thirteen miles, is interesting and often
picturesque. The settlers are mostly small farmers. Forty miles
from the capital I crossed Spring Hill, of some elevation, and
covered with wood: this is the spot where the natives cross the
country in their periodical migrations. A fortnight previous to
my journey (1830) they had murdered a settler close by and
plundered his hut. Two miles beyond the summit is Jericho, an
incipient township. One would imagine that those who had had the
childish folly to give such ridiculous and unmeaning names to the
various places in the colony, had taken the trouble to search for
them in the United States of America; for any person who had
travelled in that country would almost fancy himself there again
while passing through Tasmania.</p>
<p>The position of Oatlands, fifty-one miles from Hobart Town, is
dreary and wretched, so that my wonderment was excited in no
small degree at such an ill-favoured spot having been selected
for the formation of a town. Independently of a lake, or lagoon,
close by, there is, after rain, far too much water in the
neighbourhood; the site is too elevated, the exposure great, and
the soil none of the best; in short, this part of the country is
only adapted for grazing, or pasturage. The township consists of
a few houses, amongst which is a capital inn.</p>
<p>The country for the next eight miles is gloomy and monotonous,
nothing being visible save almost impenetrable forest; it then
becomes more open to Ross Bridge, twenty-three miles from
Oatlands.</p>
<p>Here there is a very great extent of naturally clear land,
which affords the finest pasturage possible, and is, indeed,
better calculated for grazing than for arable land. There is,
also, a fine race course, but the distance from town must be
inconvenient.</p>
<p>Campbell town is eight miles from the bridge, and contains
very few houses; it is well situated, and I had ridden (from the
bridge) over beautiful downs, almost clear of wood, and affording
good pasture. Passing alone over these interminable meads has a
more dreary effect than even through a forest; frequently not a
living creature is to be seen for miles, and the death-like
stillness does not tend to raise one's spirits. Emus were once
common here; but as man advances into a new country, animals
retire to places where they may be secure from their omnivorous
enemy; and such is the case in this island, emus having deserted
the open country, and gone to parts of it where they are less
liable to be molested.</p>
<p>The plains extend some miles farther to Epping Forest, through
which the ride of six or seven miles has nothing in it to enchant
the least fastidious traveller, unless it be some large swamps
and lagoons. The contrast is very striking when, after riding
through the "bush," the traveller comes unexpectedly upon a
plain, sprinkled only here and there with Small clusters of
trees, and on crossing it again finds himself in an extensive
forest, which is the case in this part of Van Dieman's Land; for
the transition is not at all gradual, as a person may ride many
miles without meeting a single open spot, while on the plains it
often occurs that scarcely a tree is visible.</p>
<p>On emerging from Epping Forest, the country improved; and some
distance farther is Clarendon, 108 miles from Hobart Town; it is
a mile or two off the direct route to Launceston. This estate is
on the left bank of the South Esk, a rapid stream in winter, but
fordable in summer. In front of the house there is an extensive
flat, through which winds the river; in other directions,
however, the views are highly picturesque, comprising the eastern
and western tiers, or ranges of mountains. Of the former, Ben
Lomond is the most conspicuous, and its summit is usually covered
with snow during the greater portion of the year.</p>
<p>The valley in which Clarendon stands is sixty miles in length
by twenty wide, with numerous inequalities, and is hemmed in by
the above ranges. The country is commonly open forest.</p>
<p>The distance hence to Launceston is seventeen miles, and the
country is woodland, somewhat interesting, and rather populous;
the entrance to the town, however, is not so fine as many would
have led me to believe. This is the second place in point of
consequence in the colony, being inferior only to the capital,
from which it is distant 124 miles. It stands between the rivers
North and South Esk, which here unite and fall into the Tamar, at
the head of the navigation of Port Dalrymple, and it is
forty-five miles from the sea; the tide reaches quite to the
town.</p>
<p>The lower part of Launceston is built on a flat, the remainder
rises gradually to the summit of a moderate elevation. It is of
some extent, contains in all about 2,500 inhabitants, and is not
badly laid out; but I cannot say much in favour of some of the
streets, as in wet weather the sloughs are deeper than is
convenient for those who get into them, the bullocks not
unfrequently perishing while attempting to extricate themselves
and the dray from such a disagreeable situation. At least this
was the case in 1830; and I was informed when in the colony in
November 1832, that very little improvement had been made.</p>
<p>The country around is greatly superior to that about Hobart
Town, though without the bold and fine description of scenery
observed at the latter. The soil is also much better; and it is
from this side of the island that the greater proportion of grain
is exported. The settlers are amongst the most affluent in the
colony.</p>
<p>The Tamar, at the head of the navigation, is not more, I
should think, than sixty yards across, yet vessels of upwards of
150 tons may ascend nearly to the town, but they cannot lie
alongside the wharf unless they previously discharge part of
their cargo, on account of a reef which interrupts the channel.
The width of the last is not more than twenty yards, nor does it
widen for two miles, and it is very narrow ten or twelve miles
farther.</p>
<p>One great disadvantage in this river is the circumstance of
the wind blowing continually either directly up or down it; so
that a vessel is often obliged to depend upon the tide; a great
inconvenience, as, in consequence of this, the passage from the
entrance to Launceston sometimes occupies from two to three
weeks. The entrance is also difficult to find, and one vessel
employed three days in seeking for it. Steam vessels would be a
great improvement, and would undoubtedly pay well.</p>
<p>Much of the soil on the banks is fertile, and a good deal of
land is cultivated. I was given to understand, that not a single
acre hereabouts is unlocated.</p>
<p>A site for a town was fixed upon, about forty miles from
Launceston, where it was intended that vessels of considerable
burthen should tranship their cargoes: it was called George Town,
went on increasing for a brief period, and was then deserted.</p>
<p>Many of the principal settlers on this side of the country are
rapidly improving the appearance of their farms. One gentleman
has laid down much land in English grasses, and several were
adopting a style of enclosure that would be admired in any
country, namely, a bank with a quickset hedge on it, and a double
ditch. In New South Wales I never saw <i>any</i> description of
fence except the external rails; even the gardens are often
enclosed in no other way, although there is abundance of cape
mulberry, quince, lemon and sweet briar, etc., in the country.
Some of the farms on the North and South Esk, Lake River, and
other streams, as, for instance, Woolmars, Rhodes, Pansanger,
etc., are uncommonly well situated; the scenery is in various
places beautiful; and in returning to Hobart Town by a circuitous
route, I was highly gratified by the variety of views and general
appearance of the country through which I passed.</p>
<p>Not being inclined to indulge in the <i>dolce far niente</i>,
I soon afterwards crossed the harbour to Kangaroo Point, which is
opposite, and rode to Richmond, a township ten miles from the
Point, and containing ten or twelve houses. The neighbouring
country is highly romantic, the cultivated spots contrasting well
with the surrounding hills, whose sides were swarded to the
summits with fine grass. The valleys are narrow, and of no great
length; so that a large portion of this district is much better
adapted for grazing than for tillage; but where the soil
<i>is</i> good, nothing can exceed its fertility. It was near
this that I saw oats <i>six feet high</i>; they were growing in a
rich black mould. Why land should be thought in valuable and sell
so high at this township, I could not comprehend, as the place
cannot become of any consequence for several generations; yet, an
acre joining, or rather, forming part of the township, was sold
for 65<i>l</i>.!</p>
<p>From Richmond I followed the route to Sorell Town, passing, on
my way, some few farms, and through much hilly and thickly-wooded
country; the distance is twelve miles. It is a small place,
containing a church, parsonage house, and several inns, as usual
better built than the other habitations. Repeatedly have I passed
inns by the road-side, in both colonies, and remarked how
constantly they are superior in point of neatness and comfort, to
the houses of the settlers in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Of a verity, these are rare countries for publicans (as well
as for sinners;) and, as a proof that they must occasionally be
at no loss for customers&mdash;those, too, from amongst the most
devout of the votaries of Bacchus&mdash;I may mention an
occurrence which took place at the inn at Lovely Banks, (<i>lucus
à non lucendo</i>, one of the least interesting spots in the
island,) which was related by "mine host" himself to an officer
of a regiment now in Sydney, and by him to me. A party of
<i>six</i> emancipists drank, <i>at one sitting, seven bottles of
sherry, and forty-one bottles of porter</i>, and after all,
according to the landlord's account, left the house <i>almost
sober</i>!</p>
<p>The Downs near the township are extensive, with no deficiency
of good soil; and the views of the harbour, with the distant
mountains behind Hobart Town, afford extensive and even
magnificent prospects. This district is a fair specimen of an
interesting and improving tract of country; but the township
labours under the disadvantage of being rather exposed, and water
is scarce.</p>
<p>Pitt Water is close to it; this is a large lake, or bay,
connected with Storm Bay, the entrance being so shallow as to
admit only vessels of small size.</p>
<p>Two miles from it is Orielton, an estate of 7,000, or 8,000
acres, with much good soil and excellent pasturage. On an
adjoining farm I was shewn turnips, weighing from twenty to
twenty-five pounds: they have attained a still larger size in
this colony.</p>
<p>From Sorell Town I returned to Richmond, and then continued my
ride to New Norfolk, or Elizabeth Town&mdash;for it goes by both
titles&mdash;having passed through some very pleasing country,
and enjoyed several good views of the Derwent; but there is much
dense forest. There were few farms for some distance, as the
latter portion of the ride led me through the "Bush." In this
part of the island, however, there are numerous valuable estates
in almost every direction. Elizabeth Town, thirty miles from
Sorell Town, is in the district or county of New Norfolk, and is
in every respect well situated; it stands on the river, and is
only twenty-two miles from the capital. Some of the houses, or
rather cottages, are neat enough, the inns, as usual, being
better built. During the summer months the river is brackish and
unfit for drinking; but when swollen by rains, it is fresh to a
distance of two or three miles below the town. The face of the
country around is extremely irregular, and intersected in some
directions by long mountain ranges, with detached hills and
groupes diversifying the other parts; and although it may be
considered a romantic spot, in point of scenery, it is greatly
exceeded by the country farther up the river.* I crossed in a
punt to the town, and as my way was still by the left bank of the
river, had to re-cross. Before I had ridden many miles, I came to
a remarkably perfect specimen of basaltic pillars, at a spot
where the road had been cut down twenty feet, to admit of a
passage for vehicles, and so as to show the basalt, on which
there rested a stratum, composed of a hard and solid mass of
stones and clay. The country through which I now travelled was
often highly beautiful; lofty hills, with their declivities
concealed by forests, showed themselves in the distance, on the
right of the Derwent, in some places extending close to the
river; and, where the nature of the ground admitted of locations,
the farms of the settlers added greatly to the effect. On the
left bank the country formed a series of downs, in general so
thinly sprinkled with trees, that it resembled a noble park, in
which one would hardly wish to fell a tree, save an occasional
unsightly Eucalyptus: the Acacias, too, were in full flower, and
the fragrance exhaled by them was delicious.</p>
<p class="foot">[* One of the finest views on the whole of this
river is that from Restdown (or Risdale,) the residence of Mr.
G&mdash;&mdash;n, famous even among the hospitable settlers of
these colonies for his urbanity and kindness to those who are
introduced to him.]</p>
<p>The Frenchman's Cap, <i>alias</i> Wylde's Craig, <i>alias</i>
the Peak of Teneriffe, and perhaps a dozen other <i>alias</i>
appellations besides (for the names of places in Tasmania are not
like the laws of the Medes and Persians, which alter not,) with
its snow-capped summit, was seen to great advantage. It is 4,500
feet above the level of the sea, and is the highest mountain in
the colony; why it is called the Peak of Teneriffe is only known
to the person who gave it that appellation, if haply to him.</p>
<p>After a most agreeable ride, I reached Lawrenny, an estate of
14,000 acres, the whole of which is fenced in, but very little
cultivated: it is fifty-two miles from Hobart Town.</p>
<p>Here we see hill and dale, the Derwent and two or three other
streams, much fertile soil, fine sheep-walks, and, in short, just
such an estate as a man of property would wish to possess, if
partial to a country life, and disposed to be hospitable!
Unfortunately the proprietor is absent; no great number of
respectable settlers reside near enough to form a society, and
very little has been done in the way of improvement. Even on the
eminences, some of which rise several hundred feet above the
valley in which the estate is situated, there is good soil; and
with a moderate capital a person of enterprise would soon make it
a property of very considerable value. At present the number of
sheep that can be depastured on it is calculated at 10,000; and,
admitting a fair proportion of it to be cultivated, it would
still afford feed for 7,000 or 8,000, with some pasture also for
cattle.</p>
<p>On the opposite bank of the Derwent, which here forms one
boundary to the estate, is Dunrobbin, a good farm, and very
prettily situated, though rather too much confined by forest.
There are some fine rides in the neighbourhood, but they are
chiefly on the Lawrenny side of the river.</p>
<p>The splendid tract of country, to which I have alluded,
continues only a few miles above Lawrenny and Dunrobbin: beyond
there is a confused mass of wild looking mountains, which
extended in chaotic confusion, as far as I could see. They have
been very little explored, and are of no use to the
agriculturist.</p>
<p>There are several settlers between the former and the
mountains, but only one above Dunrobbin.</p>
<p>From the last I pursued the route by the right bank of the
Derwent, and passed Fenton Forest, an estate of 3,000 acres; when
not possessing the "organ of locality," or being rather stupid,
which amounts to the same thing, I contrived to lose my way; and
after riding some distance, found myself on the banks of the
Styx, (in this island, even the infernal regions being ransacked
for names,) with no path of any kind, and a dismal forest
around.</p>
<p>The torrent brawled, and foamed, and rushed over its rocky bed
with such impetuosity, that had the experienced mariner, Charon
himself, attempted to cross a stream so violently agitated, there
h little doubt that he and his ghostly freight would have had no
small difficulty in reaching their destination.</p>
<p>So, likewise, the souls of old Homer's unburied heroes, if
compelled to pass a far more brief period than the usual term of
100 years in wandering on the banks of this melancholy stream,
would have found their peregrinations extremely fatiguing, and
the walking particularly irksome. They would also have been
greatly troubled with ennui, unless they indulged in the chase of
the kangaroo&mdash;a pastime scarcely fitted for the shades of
those stout and valiant personages.</p>
<p>For my own part, I was not a little delighted to find myself,
after no small trouble, at precisely the same spot from whence I
had diverged from the proper path just two hours before; for I
had no provisions with me, and it would have been scarcely worth
my while to slay my horse, as the poor quadruped was not
overburthened with flesh. The Styx crosses the route to New
Norfolk, and falls into the Derwent a few miles from Fenton
Forest, but I was not aware of this. I am surprised that the
neighbouring districts were not called Erebus, Tartarus, and
Elysium; or at all events, after the general term of Ades!</p>
<p>It is a bad, nay a dangerous practice, to ride much alone in
the "Bush," as in the event of meeting with an accident, the
traveller is almost sure of perishing if disabled; and during the
heavy and sudden squalls which sometimes occur, whereby large
branches are blown to a considerable distance, an accident might
happen when least expected. I have, however, ridden some hundred
miles in the two colonies, entirely alone, and must confess this
mode of travelling is so consonant with my mode of thinking, that
on revisiting Australia, I should most probably again indulge in
it.</p>
<p>Six or seven miles from the above estate, I came to Bushy
Park, where the best of home-made wines and cider are found, and
poultry enough to supply the capital for months; but of what use
would it be to send fowls to town, if the person who sends them
cannot get paid? I next came to Ivanhoe, only three miles from
Bushy Park, and Redlands is the same distance from Ivanhoe; both
are good farms. On this side of the river the settlers have
formed hedges of quickset and sweet-briar, which, especially the
latter, grow in this country with a luxuriance rarely seen
elsewhere; they certainly conduce greatly to break the general
monotony of the landscape, a point seldom attempted in New South
Wales.</p>
<p>From Redlands to Elizabeth Town, six miles, and thence to
Hobart Town, twenty-two miles, there are many noble prospects,
and this is the case the whole distance from Dunrobbin. Indeed
the scenery on both sides of the river is uncommonly varied and
beautiful; but though the views from some of the elevated grounds
on the right bank are superior to any on the left, the country on
the latter has very considerably the advantage in every other
respect. I may safely say that I passed no tract of country in
New South Wales (in the located districts), at all to be compared
to that extending from Hobart Town to about sixty miles up the
Derwent, the Hunter's River, with its "<i>park-like scenery</i>"
falling so far short of it, that there is not the slightest
resemblance between the two, consequently a comparison would be
ridiculous.</p>
<p>Great Swan Port, 110 miles by land, from the capital, I
visited without intending it, the captain of the vessel which
conveyed me from Sydney, having mistaken it for Storm Bay, and
run in there. The whole country round this extensive bay appeared
to be covered with dense forest, nor did we observe a single
clear spot except on the farms, of which the number is very
small.</p>
<p>Maria Island is here, and was until lately a penal settlement:
there is some good land upon it, but the soil is in general
indifferent. Port Arthur is fifty-five miles from the capital,
and is considered one of the best harbours in the colony. The
country around presents an unvaried prospect of thickly timbered
hills, and the soil is so stony that it would never pay the
trouble and expense of clearing for the purposes of cultivation.
The "scrub" is in many places impervious, so that the country is
often impassable, and always difficult to travel over. The timber
is for the most part stringy-bark and gum-trees which grow to a
large size both on the hills and in the valleys. This is a penal
settlement, to which those convicts are sent, who have not been
guilty of crimes of sufficient enormity to entitle them to a
residence at Macquarrie Harbour.</p>
<p>Circular Head is on the north-west side of the island and is
joined to the main by a low sandy isthmus. The land at the back
is somewhat lower than the Head; and is formed into gentle
slopes. A slight covering of withered grass gave it a smooth
appearance. There was very little soil spread over the rock and
sand, and the general aspect of the country was that of
sterility; so much for Flinders' account of this part of the
coast.</p>
<p>While here he saw a flight of sooty Petrels so numerous, that
they occupied one hour and a half in passing; and he computes
them to have amounted to at least <i>one hundred and forty
millions</i>. This reminds one of a flight of pigeons seen in
America by Wilson, but amounting to nearly <i>double</i> that
number.</p>
<p>It is at Circular Head that the Van Dieman's Land Company have
a tract of 300,000 acres. There are persons who say they would
not object to locate near one of these great company grants,
alleging as a reason, that they could easily manage to depasture
their cattle or sheep upon so extensive a run, without in the
least interfering with the company itself. The reason, though it
may appear plausible, is a very bad one, there being several
against it of much greater weight: one alone, and that perhaps of
the least consequence, would deter me, and it is the circumstance
of being entirely shut out from society; as a ride of fifteen or
twenty miles to pay a morning visit is no trifle, nor can it be
performed except by those who have much unoccupied time.</p>
<p>From general I shall now proceed to particular observations on
the colony, commencing with the metropolis.</p>
<p>The capital of Tasmania stands at the foot of a lofty
mountain, clothed to the summit with dense forest, and forming a
grand feature in the landscape. The distance from Cape Pillar is
thirty-three miles, and from Tasman's Head thirty-seven: these
two capes form the entrance to Storm Bay, and are thirty-six
miles asunder. Hobart Town is in the latitude 42 deg. 54 min.
south long. 147 deg. 28 min. east. The bay contains several
islands, and continues to the town, where it narrows so much that
the harbour is not more than three miles broad, and in some
places the width is still less; it is not near so sheltered as
Port Jackson, but has excellent holding ground, and extends some
miles above the town, though ships seldom anchor above Sullivan's
Cove, where the Derwent may be said to terminate. The principal
portion of Storm Bay is included between the land extending from
Cape Pillar to the entrance of the Derwent and Brune's Island,
between which and the south-east part of the main land is
D'Entrecasteaux Channel, where there is a passage for large
ships. The island is thirty miles in length and in some parts
several broad, but at Adventure Bay is very narrow. The scenery
both in Storm Bay and the Channel is interesting, often
picturesque, and combines also its share of the sombre. The
country is very densely timbered, with much underwood; and fern,
six or seven feet high, grows in such abundance, that in most
places we found it quite impossible to penetrate into the bush;
this was in the Channel, the shores of the Bay, except here and
there, being far more free from this plant.</p>
<p>Mount Wellington is a most singular mountain, and worthy of a
better description than I am capable of giving of it. A road
having been made by a person for the convenience of bringing down
his sawn timber, shingles, etc., the first four miles from town
may now be performed on horseback, the obstacles to an ascent,
therefore, have been materially decreased. It is when a person
arrives amongst a species of grass-tree that the walking becomes
disagreeable, for the leaves often warn the traveller by their
sharpness that they are not to be handled with impunity; there
are also vast accumulations of large stones, generally with
smooth surfaces, to clamber over which requires care and
exertion; some of these stones are ten or twelve feet thick.
Notwithstanding the impediments, a moderately active pedestrian
will experience no difficulty in ascending the mountain, and
returning to town in twelve hours, allowing three for exploring
or examining the summit.</p>
<p>The mountain is stated to rise 4,000 feet above the level of
the sea, some accounts say 3,000, the medium would most likely be
the height of it. The summit is a plain some miles in extent, and
it is the abrupt termination of a range of considerable height.
The side fronting the town is a tremendous precipice, faced with
immense columns of basalt, many of which are as regular as if
made by man himself; and thousands of fragments are scattered
about in the most confused manner imaginable, showing evidently
that some violent convulsion must have taken place at a former
period.</p>
<p>At some spots the columnar fragments have been thrown up in
heaps to the height of forty or fifty feet or more, and in others
isolated columns from ten to twenty feet high are seen; these
last often have upon them a large piece of basalt (four or five
feet high), unconnected with the pillar itself, and seemingly
placed there by some person. In one instance two of the columns
formed, as it were, a gateway about eighteen feet wide, and each
of them was surmounted by a detached block of basalt. On my way
up I had crossed a large bed of shells and other organic remains,
and have no doubt the geologist would find in it a variety of
interesting objects.</p>
<p>The view from Mount Wellington is really superb, extending, on
a clear day, to the northward beyond great Swan Port, over a
tract of country of nearly forty miles, as the crow flies, and
nearly as far to the westward; to the southward the view is
bounded by mountain ranges, to the eastward by the ocean.</p>
<p>From the numerous fine springs of excellent water which are
seen at almost every step on the summit, I am induced to believe
a copious supply will at some future period be brought to the
town; at present they all flow towards the Huon River.</p>
<p>The space occupied by Hobart Town may be about a square mile;
some of the streets are laid out with great regularity, but not a
few of them run up the side and on the top of a hill. A small
mountain-stream flows through it, affording a scanty supply of
abominably bad water to the lower part; and the water is not much
improved by the dead animals and various kinds of filth thrown
into it. A stream of better description has lately been conveyed
to the barracks and some of the principal streets by
pipes&mdash;a great advantage, as nothing is more likely to cause
sickness than impure water.</p>
<p>The houses are mostly small, and built in the cottage style;
some of good size have been erected within the last year or two,
though the style of building is still far inferior to that
observed at Sydney. The public-houses, in proportion to the
population, are not quite so numerous as in the other colony, yet
they are sufficiently so; the number in Sydney being 197 (there
were others building), gives one to sixty-eight free persons; in
Hobart Town there are eighty-four, or one to seventy-eight free
persons. Although their climate is neither so hot nor dry as that
of Australia, some of the Tasmanians are not less regular in
their devotions than their brethren in that colony.</p>
<p>All the streets run at right angles to each other, and in most
of them there is a piece of garden in front of each house: this
is particularly the case in Macquarrie-street, in which are the
principal public buildings, so that it has a much better
appearance than George-street in Sydney. A law was made that no
house should be nearer the footpath than twelve feet, a rule
which ought to obtain in all new colonies, and we should not then
see the uncouth heaps of houses, with narrow lanes between them,
so commonly perceived in our own settlements.</p>
<p>For the cemetery, a spot has most injudiciously been selected,
that will ere long be surrounded by buildings, and close to that
part of the harbour which was most likely to be wanted for
wharves and stores: and as the Government is now employed on the
formation of a wharf of great consequence the remains of the dead
must be removed&mdash;a circumstance always to be deprecated.
Places of interment should be situated in scenes of solitude, as
in the East, particularly in these colonies, where the heat of
summer is so intense, and where there are so many places near the
towns which might have been selected, as being both retired, and,
from the localities of the situation, so little likely to
influence the purity of the atmosphere, by the miasmata
constantly generated by the decomposition of animal matter.</p>
<p>In countries where those human goules, the "resurrection men,"
disturb, by their unholy occupation, the repose of the departed,
it may possibly be a matter of precaution to form a cemetery so
situated as to be under the immediate observation of the living;
but in the colonies there can exist no inducement to disinter a
body.</p>
<p>The settlement was at first established several miles farther
up the harbour; the following year (1804) the present spot was
finally determined upon, in consequence of the deficiency of
water at the former place. The environs are in every respect
superior to those of Sydney, being far more picturesque, and the
rides and walks far more interesting. The Government domain at
the latter is certainly pretty, and some of the views from it are
good; that from the lighthouse is also grand, at least all who
admire a prospect of sky and water will consider it to be so: but
what are these compared to the prospects from Mount Wellington,
Mount Nelson, and other lofty spots on both sides of Storm Bay?
Even the view from the elevated part of the road to New Norfolk,
only a mile from the town&mdash;in fact not so far, as the
houses, though not continuous, extend some distance in that
direction&mdash;comprehends a finer landscape than is to be found
within twenty miles of Sydney; and the shores of the harbour have
also a more lively aspect than those of Port Jackson, as there
are houses and farms for some miles below the town; on the
opposite side, likewise, an occasional farm is seen; the soil,
too, is better, and the verdure is very different.</p>

<p class="foot">[* <i>Sic</i>.]</p>
<p>The district extends some miles; deduct, therefore, 500 for
the population outside the town (it can hardly amount to so
many), and we have remaining 9,601 for that of the capital
itself; or, if we take the whole district into account, 5,299
less than the district of Sydney. But it must be considered that
there are in Hobart Town neatly 1,500 convicts more than in the
other capital (these are employed on public works), so that the
fairest way of judging of the respective population of the two
capitals is to take the difference between their free population,
which gives 6,774 in favour of Sydney.</p>
<p>The total population of the island was stated to be 30,000:
this, like many other conjectures relative to the colonies, wants
confirmation. The free population in 1830 was 13,000; so that it
is not unlikely the island may now contain in all 30,000
inhabitants. The society is so limited that a stranger would
without doubt find this town a dull residence; but I do not agree
with the officer who lately published a letter on Tasmania, that
all the families are inhospitable. That an English town is in
general a more agreeable residence for a bachelor, in respect to
society, than Hobart Town (or Sydney either) will admit of no
doubt; if, however, a person can obtain one or two good letters
of introduction he may get on well enough both with the
aristocracy and merchants, though decidedly better with the last!
The officer to whom I have alluded adds, that the <i>settlers</i>
are also inhospitable. In making such an assertion, I can assure
him he is entirely mistaken; and any person who has been as much
about the colony as myself will agree with me, that a more
hospitable class of people cannot be found in any part of the
world. Like those in Australia, they are always glad to see a
stranger, and, in so far as my own experience went, invariably
treat him with the greatest attention and urbanity.</p>
<p>What may be the number of convicts in the colony I have no
idea, as I omitted to procure the necessary information
previously to my departure.</p>
<p>The rules and regulations respecting them are much the same as
in New South Wales; but for some reason, which I have not heard
explained, the rations differ, and, the price of provisions being
considered, they are, consequently, more expensive than in
Sydney.</p>
<p>Those allowed to the men are:&mdash;Meat, 10½ lbs.; flour, 9½
lbs.; sugar, 7 ounces; soap, 3½ do.; salt, 2 do.</p>
<p>The clothing supplied to them must consist of, per
annum:&mdash;Woollen clothing, 2 suits; boots, 3 pair; shirts, 4;
hat or cap, 1.</p>
<p>The bedding to be a palliass, stuffed with wool, two blankets,
and a rug, to be considered the property of the master.</p>
<p>The regulation which succeeds states that "The supply of food
and clothing above specified, with comfortable lodging, and
medicine in the event of illness, being deemed fully equivalent,
<i>no payment of wages is in future to be demanded by the
convict;</i> and it is strongly recommended that none should be
allowed!" I should hardly think it likely any would be allowed,
unless under very peculiar circumstances.</p>
<p>When a convict is assigned to a settler, he is furnished by
Government with one suit of clothes, for which his master has to
pay one guinea.</p>
<p>The weekly rations to the women are:&mdash;Flour, 8½ lbs.;
meet, 5¼ lbs.; tea, 2 oz.; sugar, ½ lb.; soap, 2 oz.; salt, 1½
oz.</p>
<p>For the information of my readers of the <i>beau sexe</i>, I
subjoin a list of the wearing apparel allowed them
annually:&mdash;Cotton gown, 1; bed-gowns, or jackets, 2; shifts,
3; flannel petticoats, 2; stuff petticoats, 2; shoes, 3 pair;
calico caps, 3; stockings, 3 pair; neck handkerchiefs, 2; check
aprons, 3; bonnet, 1.</p>
<p>A woman transported for fourteen years must have it in her
power, one would suppose, to accumulate a tolerable stock of
clothing.</p>
<p>The above articles of dress to be of a plain and neat
description, not exceeding the cost of 7<i>l</i>. per annum; "and
beyond which allowance the Lieutenant-Governor strongly
recommends that no female convict should be remunerated."</p>
<p>In addition, a female is entitled to the same proportion of
bedding as a male.</p>
<p>Here we have sufficient data for ascertaining the annual cost
of a female; and, admitting the most moderate price of the
various provisions, the expense of sending for her, perhaps from
some distance, etc., it will most probably be little less than
from 15<i>l</i>. to 18<i>l</i>.; a large sum, when we reflect
that the value of money is so much greater than in England.</p>
<p>A male convict would cost about the same.</p>
<p>It must be understood that the meat and flour, being produced
on the farm, a price has been stated for both&mdash;lower than
they would cost in Hobart Town. It may, perhaps, be said, that
when provisions are produced on the estate, the expense of
maintaining the servants must be very trifling: such is the case
in New South Wales, where cattle are so abundant, and,
consequently, of small value; but it is very different in
Tasmania.</p>
<p>On the farms, where the settlers employ their own people to
make shoes, etc., there would be some decrease in the expense;
but, every thing considered, the above sum may be taken as the
average cost of a servant.</p>
<p>The remarks made on the convicts of New South Wales apply
equally to those of this colony; the only point, therefore, which
I have now to notice respects those who are sent to Macquarrie
Harbour, on the west coast. This is the principal penal
settlement in the colony, and its situation is described as cold
and bleak, being entirely exposed to the ocean. The harbour is an
inlet of the sea, running up into the land a distance of twenty
miles. The head-quarters of the settlement are on Sarah's Island,
in the south-western comer of the harbour.</p>
<p>The convicts sent there are, of course, of the worst
description, and there are commonly from 350 to 400 of them at
the place; some of whom are employed in constructing vessels, and
others in cutting timber, consisting chiefly of the Huon pine.
They also make shoes, and weave cloth from the raw wool produced
in the colony. As no beasts of burden are allowed, the work must
be sufficiently laborious; but the men are not obliged to work in
irons. Although the climate is considered inclement, yet, from
their regular way of living and simple food, the prisoners enjoy
good health. The only river is the Gordon, which has a bar at the
entrance; it is afterwards navigable between thirty and forty
miles up, and seldom less than one hundred yards wide. Some of
the scenery is romantic enough; on the whole, however, this part
of the island does not appear to possess more than its share of
charms.</p>
<p>In mentioning Norfolk Island, I have said that convicts sent
to the penal settlements will often go to great lengths, in order
to be returned to headquarters! It is at Macquarrie Harbour, in
particular, that this is the case, some of them having even
committed murder, that they might be returned to Hobart Town,
although well aware they will be tried, and most certainly
hanged: their argument is, that the life they lead is miserable,
and, by going to the capital, they will see their friends again;
after which, whether they suffer death or not, is a matter of no
consequence! Such is the account given me by a highly respectable
and well-informed resident; and, even if exaggerated, it tends to
show the extreme aversion the convicts have to the hardships and
restrictions of this second banishment.</p>
<p>Some persons are of opinion that these outcasts of society are
treated with unnecessary severity; but what is to be done with
doubly-convicted felons? If not punished with some degree of
rigour, is it not evident that they would serve as no example to
deter others of the convicts from committing crimes? From all I
could learn, they are dealt by rather favourably than otherwise;
of course they are compelled, to work, but if this be considered
a punishment, they undergo it in common with those who are free.
The principal object of the Government is to keep them out of the
way, so as to prevent them from contaminating the well-disposed
portion of the prisoners. It is not long since several of these
wretches murdered one of their own companions, by knocking him on
the head with an axe, having previously drawn lots who should
inflict the blow; and, it would appear, without any provocation.
They consequently suffered the extreme penalty of the law.</p>
<p>In another instance, nine of them drowned a constable, without
even the shadow of a reason for so doing, as the man had neither
injured them, nor could prevent their escape. They then took to
the "bush," where they wandered about for some time, and one of
the party was finally taken. From his account there seems to be
little doubt, that the strong ones among them subsisted upon the
bodies of those of their comrades whom they contrived to murder,
and it is supposed they all perished except the man who was
secured.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable characters, perhaps, ever engaged
in bush-ranging, was Michael Howe. This gloomy savage was
transported, 1812, for seven years; on his arrival at Hobart Town
he was assigned as servant to a settler, absconded, and became
the leader of a gang. He does not appear to have remained long
with them, but wrote to the Governor, offering to give himself
up, provided he might be assured of personal safety, and a chance
of eventually obtaining his pardon: his terms being agreed to, he
surrendered himself. In less than three months again absconded;
but his former associates looked upon him as a traitor, so that
he was compelled to wander about alone during fifteen months:
when, in the attempt to take him, his skull was fractured by the
blows he received, and he died on the spot. He was nearly six
years in the bush, and appears to have caused great alarm.</p>
<p>Of Brady there are many anecdotes; but this man, bad as he
was, was a very different character from the other. The following
incident was related by him, after his apprehension, to a
magistrate, from whom I had the particulars:&mdash;</p>
<p>A man by whom he had frequently been harboured, at length
determined to betray him, so as to be entitled to the reward
offered for his capture, and for this purpose concealed two
constables in his hut.</p>
<p>It is curious, and probably inexplicable, that persons should
so often feel a presentiment of approaching evil, for this
prescient instinct can be of no use, seeing that the evil is ever
unavoidable; and yet who has not felt it himself at some period
of his passage through life?</p>
<p>When Brady was about to approach the hut, where he had so
often been before, suspicions arose in his mind that all was not
right; which, in fact, was an instance of the singular prescience
to which I have alluded. On observing this to a man who was with
him, the latter said it was highly improbable that the owner of
the hut would betray him, after all that had passed between them!
Without being in the least convinced of the soundness of the
argument, he advanced, and when near enough, was fired upon by
the constables. The result was a wound in the arm, and the
seizure of himself and his companion: the latter was marched off,
in charge of the constables, to the next magistrate, and Brady
was left bound, under the charge of his betrayer. After a while,
the former asked his quondam friend to let him lie on the bed,
and to place over him a kangaroo rug, as his wound was very
painful. His request being complied with, he availed himself of
the opportunity to extricate his hands from the cord by which
they were bound, and then asked for water. While procuring some,
the man laid aside his gun, which being perceived by Brady, he
sprang from the bed and laid hold of it, so as completely to turn
the tables upon his treacherous keeper.</p>
<p>When a prisoner, Brady had reproached him for having acted
with such perfidy to one who had placed implicit confidence in
him; he only replied by observing, that Brady could but be
hanged, which was of no consequence, as there was neither God or
devil! As soon, however, as he found himself in the power of the
man whom he had injured, and that he might dread the worst from
his vengeance, the craven threw himself on his knees, and in the
most abject manner begged, for God's sake, that his life might be
spared! Brady replied, "You are a pretty rascal to use the name
of God, after having told me there was none; however, I will not
shoot you now, as an alarm might be created by the report of my
gun, but if we meet again, beware!" Brady then made his escape.
Afterwards, when commanding a regular gang of bush-rangers, he
fell in with this same man, seized him, and, holding a pistol to
his head, told him he had just five minutes left to say his
prayers. When he perceived his death resolved upon, he coolly
placed his head against the door of a hut by which they were
standing, and said, "Then fire, and be d&mdash;d to you!" upon
which he was shot dead. When the body was discovered, the bullet
was found to have barely penetrated the skull, and was quite
flattened!</p>
<p>At one time the plan was tried of giving a prisoner permission
to go out and join the bush-rangers, that he might betray them
into the hands of the police. The man retained his irons, left
town secretly, and, on falling in with the marauders, pretended
he had escaped from goal. This man&oelig;uvre succeeded once or
twice, but the bush-rangers soon became aware of the scheme, and
acted accordingly: however, on one occasion they committed a
slight mistake. A convict had been guilty of some crime for which
he was sent to prison to await his trial; not admiring this
curtailment of his wonted exercise, or his organ of space having
experienced a sudden development, he got out of the prison and
made off. It was not long before he met with Brady's gang, which
he wished forthwith to join: but as they naturally supposed him
to be another decoyer, in spite of his protestations to the
contrary, he was adjudged to suffer death. The sentence was
politely intimated to him, and, at the same time, he was allowed
five minutes to make any arrangements for his exit. Brady seems
to have thought time of no small value, if one may form an
opinion from his want of liberality when granting it to those who
required it more than himself.</p>
<p>The time being expired, the gang forced him to swallow a whole
bottle of laudanum, of which they had a quantity by them in case
of being apprehended; for it was their intention, in the event of
this happening, to give themselves a quietus rather than receive
one at the hands of the executioner: they left him, as they
fancied, <i>in articulo mortis</i>. The quantity, perhaps the
quality, saved the man, as, just after the gang had quitted him,
which was immediately, his stomach rejected the laudanum, the
narcotic effects of which merely caused him to take a sounder nap
than he had been accustomed to. On awaking and finding himself
still in the land of the living, he arose and moved on; but,
after wandering about for some time, fell in, a second time, with
Brady and his myrmidons, who, as might naturally be expected,
were not a little astonished at seeing him. "Hollo! what, ar'nt
you dead?" (such was the greeting)&mdash;"well, we'll do for you
now, at all events!" It is to be presumed he had five minutes
more granted him for preparation, but as I am not certain of
this, the point must still remain doubtful. Two pistols were
discharged at him, one of which took effect in his back and
passed round the surface of the body, and the other inflicted a
flesh wound of no great magnitude. He fell, and was left for
dead; which would imply that the aforesaid myrmidons had not
taken a very strict (post mortem) examination of the body, or
they would have saved themselves farther trouble, as well as
powder and lead&mdash;both scarce articles in the "Bush." The
man, obstinately bent on not quitting the world in such a hurry,
again rallied, dressed his wounds as well as he could, and once
more set off in the intention of giving himself up at the first
place he came to. Here he reckoned without his host, for once
more he met his evil genii, who must have believed he possessed
more lives than one of the feline race. In this last rencontre he
could hardly expect the usual law of five minutes, and
accordingly, it does not appear to have been conceded. A pistol
was fired at his head, but instead of entering the skull (most
likely one of considerable density) the bullet glanced and went
nearly round it, causing a severe wound, and striking him
senseless to the ground. The supposed corpse was cast into a
creek that was nearly dry, and a few branches were thrown over
it. This man is now in the colony, alive and well, and tells the
story himself, having recovered from his wounds, neither of which
was of a dangerous nature. The fact was also corroborated by
Brady, when examined by the gentleman from whom I got the
account, and, strange as the relation may appear, it is perfectly
correct. Brady was finally disabled, like Achilles, in the heel,
and his career was terminated upon a scaffold.</p>
<p>The bush-rangers admit that the life they lead is wretched
almost beyond endurance. Constantly on the watch, to prevent
their pursuers from surprising them, fearful of treachery from
their companions in iniquity, and harrassed by the reflection,
that while reposing themselves they may pass unexpectedly into
the sleep of death; exposed to the vicissitudes of the weather,
and often afraid to light a fire lest it might lead to their
discovery&mdash;besides suffering, as they sometimes must, from
hunger and fatigue, one would imagine that death itself would be
preferable to a life of such hopeless misery. Their career is
invariably of brief duration, nor would any but the most
desperate characters ever resolve upon leading a life of so much
privation and anxiety.</p>
<p>The principal exports from Van Dieman's Land, consist of wool,
black whale oil, grain, mimosa bark, etc. Of the first, say the
colonists, a larger quantity was exported in 1831 than from
Australia. The only way in which one can account for this
apparent impossibility, is, to assume that the wool of the
preceding year, or a large portion of it, was kept back and
exported together with that of 1831; for it is out of the
question to suppose, that this island, where the largest flock
does not exceed from 12,000 to 15,000, can export more wool than
a colony so much more extensive, and where the united flocks of
only ten individuals probably exceed 130,000. I have lost the
returns of the exports and imports, and am in consequence
incapacitated from giving their amount: the revenue is probably
£65,000, and in 1830 there was an excess of income over
expenditure of £20,000.</p>
<p>The tonnage of the vessels that arrived at Hobart Town in the
year 1831, was rather under 20,000 tons.</p>
<p>The breed of horses is inferior to that of New South Wales,
with the exception of the dray-horse, which is of a finer
description than the same animal at Sydney, the latter being of a
much lighter build, and better adapted for the climate than one
framed in a more bulky mould. The Tasmanians find great fault
with those horses that are imported from Sydney, and say their
temper is bad; but this objection does not seem to deter them
from purchasing the animals as soon as landed. The price of one
valued at about 30<i>l</i>. in Sydney, is from 50<i>l</i>. to
60<i>l</i>., though much depends upon chance or accident: I saw
an instance where a person lost considerably by some horses which
he had imported from the other colony.</p>
<p>The cattle resemble those of New South Wales, but I have seen
more pure Devonshires in this colony; the bullocks are not so
large, for in Argyle several were upwards of a thousand weight;
with this exception, I am not aware of any essential distinction
between the cattle of the two countries.</p>
<p>The price of working bullocks is from 10<i>l</i>. to
12<i>l</i>. the pair, and a cow of a pure breed, 25<i>l</i>.; the
value of one, generally speaking, is from 8<i>l</i>. to
10<i>l</i>. It would excite a smile in a stranger to observe the
mode of milking a cow in this part of the world: the animal is
made to stand in a kind of stall of four posts; the two in front
are so contrived, that one is pushed back to admit the animal's
head, and is then pushed to and secured to the other by a cross
bar; one of the hind legs is now stretched out and secured by a
rope to another post, and this is the common plan throughout the
colonies.</p>
<p>I heard of one settler possessing 4,000 head of cattle, but
have some reason to doubt the correctness of my information, for
the demand is far too great to induce any one to keep up so large
a herd, and if such herds are found in the island, the price of
meat is rather unaccountable.</p>
<p>The sheep are of all sorts and descriptions, and on the whole
not equal to those of Australia, though they will in all
probability be so ere long, at least such is the opinion of the
settlers.</p>
<p>What is the value of one of a superior breed, I cannot exactly
say; the usual price of a fair woolled one is from 15<i>s</i>. to
20<i>s</i>, and for those of a poor or common kind, from
5<i>s</i>. to 10<i>s</i>. One would imagine that a sheep of the
value of only 5<i>s</i>. or 10<i>s</i>, must indeed be of a
miserable description, when the price of meat is considered; for
some of the South Down stock were sold to the butchers, even up
the country, at two guineas each. With respect however, to this
subject there are many points quite incomprehensible to the mere
traveller, and which can be understood only by those who are
thoroughly conversant with the affairs of the colony.</p>

<p>From this it will easily be perceived how much cheaper the
necessaries of life are in Sydney; and as house-rent is also
higher in Hobart Town, so is the expense of living very far
greater. Another disadvantage in Hobart Town is, there is no
markets and the inhabitants are therefore obliged to purchase in
the shops or stores every article they require. This is
positively discreditable to the colony; but when I asked some of
the settlers why they did not send their surplus stock into town,
and establish a market in spite of the shopkeepers, their answer
was that it would not pay the expense and trouble! As this was
somewhat unaccountable, in so far as related to those residing at
no great distance from the capital, I put the question to a
settler, in whose opinion I could place the greatest reliance. He
informed me that it would be useless to send in poultry, etc.,
because he could not get for it a fair remunerating price in
<i>ready money</i>; and that he did not choose to dispose of it,
<i>probably</i> at a low price, and <i>certainly</i> at twelve
months' credit! Here was at once an elucidation of the matter;
and, thus circumstanced, he doubtlessly acted wisely in not
attending so much as formerly to the rearing of stock.</p>
<p>An attempt was once made by the government to establish a
market, which failed; and it is intended, as soon as the new
wharf is finished, to try another.</p>
<p>English money is so scarce in the place, that it is with great
difficulty it can be procured at less than from three to four per
cent premium. Gold is never got at a smaller premium. The Spanish
dollar passes at 4<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., and is, with copper, the
only money to be seen in the shops; indeed a person may often
search half through the town before he can get a note changed,
unless he is willing to receive the change in halfpence!</p>
<p>Van Dieman's land, or Tasmania, was discovered by Tasman in
1642, visited by Cook in 1773, and the colony established in
1803. From that period 1825, it was included in the government of
New South Wales, and it then became independent.</p>
<p>The island is situated between 40 deg. 44 min. and 42 deg. 39
min. south latitude, and 145 deg. 38 min. and 148 deg. 24 min. of
east longitude. Its extreme length is 191 geographical miles, and
greatest breadth 171.</p>
<p>From its general resemblance to New Holland, one would be
induced to believe it a continuation of the latter, nor in
travelling through it will the distinction be found very
great.</p>
<p>Considering its extent, it is, if possible, even more
mountainous than New South Wales; for look which way one will,
the country appears to rise irregularly into a confused jumble of
wild and woody hills, a few only forming ranges. Between these,
are valleys, some of tolerable width, but more extremely narrow,
and entirely enclosed by mountains. The plains are the only
exception; they are of great extent, almost without trees, and
those at Campbell Town exceed 12,000 acres.</p>
<p>In respect to rivers it has the advantage over the other
colony; as they are not only more numerous in proportion to the
size of the island, but never cause such disastrous floods. The
Tamar, however, is the only one that is navigable to any
distance. After the Derwent and Tamar, the following are the
principal streams; and their names, with some exceptions, display
more taste than those of the Hunter's river district; for when
native names are not employed, those of our own rivers should be
substituted, with some attention, however, to consistency. In
this list, the main absurdity lies in the application of the
names of considerable rivers to small streams:&mdash;Ouse,
Shannon, Clyde, Esk, Thames, Plenty (he who named the last must
have been sadly at a loss for a word), Styx, Macquarrie, Isis,
Mersey, Meander, Forth, Iris, Leven, Emu, Cam, etc. etc. In
regard to the names of places, the taste is not quite so
apparent; as, for example, Jerusalem, Jericho, Bagdad, Salt-pan
Plains, Break-of-day Plains, Bothwell, Hamilton, Abyssinia, etc.
etc.; so, likewise, with the mountains. Of lakes, the island has
several, the largest of which is fifteen miles in extent.</p>
<p>Of the origin of the natives of this country, little, if any
thing, is known. They are very different from the New Hollanders,
and, if possible, even more barbarous, approaching nearer to the
"mere animal" than the former. Some writers say they come from
New Guinea; others from Africa. The truth is, no one knows from
whence they sprung. It has been considered a remarkable
circumstance that these people should be so different from their
neighbours; but we constantly observe in the South Seas, islands
not far asunder, the inhabitants of which are totally distinct
races. Any difficulty that may exist in accounting for this
apparently singular circumstance has been cleared up by Cook, who
visited an island where he perceived that the inhabitants spoke
the same language, had the same actions, and, in short were
essentially of the same race as those he had previously seen at
another island some hundred miles off. He ascertained from the
islanders themselves that a party, while in a canoe, were driven
off the land by a storm, and finally cast ashore on the spot
where he found them. It is therefore easy to conceive that other
islands may have become populated in the same manner, and it is
possible this may have been the case with Van Dieman's Land. From
whatever part of the world they may have come these people must
have deteriorated, as a nation so utterly savage can scarcely be
found elsewhere. The Van Dieman's Landers (I may not term them
Tasmanians, as that would apply to native-born whites, who would
not thank me for my portrait of them) have woolly hair, features
flat and disagreeable, with a perfectly black complexion; and it
struck me their eyes were more deeply seated than I ever observed
in any other people. They are more strongly formed than the New
Hollanders being neither so slight, nor so long in the limbs;
their aspect I consider, if any thing, inferior. I heard of no
ornament among them, and it is said they never wear clothing; but
I should fancy they must do so in very cold weather, as the
winter is occasionally extremely inclement, and it is not
probable that they would throw away the skins of the animals they
kill. They are known to have distinct tribes, each with its chief
or leader; do not appear to have any rites or ceremonies,
religious or otherwise; and lead a wandering life, like all the
unsophisticated children of nature; and if their Christian
brethren would not interfere with or annoy them, would very
likely be sufficiently happy.</p>
<p>For a long time they agreed perfectly well with the whites,
but became troublesome (well they might after the treatment they
experienced) in 1814, though it was not till 1826 that the evil
began to assume a serious character: in that year two of them
<i>were tried and hanged</i> for the murder of a white. Whatever
may be urged in favour of the policy of this act, may be retorted
by much against the humanity and propriety of it: perhaps it was
an act of absolute necessity; but it would surely be preferable
to slay a black in "hot blood," while about to commit violence,
or even afterwards, than to take away his life by a law he does
not understand. The <i>lex talionis</i> is familiar to every one,
and more particularly to savages; if those two men, therefore,
had been killed in the "bush," it might have made some impression
on the natives generally, but, being hanged, the chances are,
that if their countrymen knew of it, they would only feel
irritated, and retaliate the first opportunity. "In a state of
nature," says Gibbon, "every man has a right to defend by force
of arms, his person or his <i>possessions</i>; to repel, or
<i>even to prevent</i> the violence of his enemies, and to extend
his hostilities to a reasonable measure of satisfaction and
retaliation."</p>
<p>The settlers say that some of the tribes are infinitely more
savage and mischievous than the others; more treacherous, and
more difficult to be wrought upon: it was against two tribes of
this description that an expedition was sent in September, 1830,
and as it created some sensation, I will first notice the cause
of hostility evinced by the natives against the colonists, and
afterwards the expedition itself. Formerly they were in the habit
of visiting the towns, and also the various settlers from whom
they procured bread, tobacco, etc., both parties being at that
time on the most friendly terms. At some distance from the
located parts of the colony, there are stock-stations, which are
not often visited by the owner of the stock, so that the convict
servants who are placed there in charge, are in a great measure
their own masters, or at most are but little controlled. Now some
of these men have conducted themselves towards the aborigines in
a most brutal manner; for, not contented with taking their women,
the wretches have been guilty of the most horrid atrocities
towards them, murdering them without scruple. In consequence of
these continual acts of aggression, the aborigines appear to have
adopted the system of reprisals, and not only put to death some
of their oppressors, but unfortunately several well-disposed
persons from whom they had never experienced any injury. Of
course the government were under the necessity of trying to put a
stop to such sanguinary proceedings, and accordingly prepared the
expedition, with the view of driving the two tribes upon a
peninsula at no great distance from the capital, and confining
them there by a chain of posts across the narrow neck of land
which connects it with the main.</p>
<p>Orders were therefore issued for all the disposable part of
the military, the government convicts, and as many of those in
the employ of the settlers as could be spared, together with the
volunteers who might feel inclined to give proof of their martial
prowess, to set off for that part of the colony where the crusade
against the Paynim was to commence, the inhabitants of the town
in the mean time taking charge of the posts, and doing duty in
the absence of the troops.</p>
<p>In thus denouncing war against the original possessors of the
soil, the sole object of the government was to drive the
obnoxious blacks upon the peninsula, without destroying any one
of them; indeed so far from this, the greatest exertions had been
made to civilize them, though hitherto in vain; as they show no
small aversion to clothing their sable bodies in a christian-like
manner, and avail themselves, when taken, of the earliest
opportunity to escape, at the same time throwing away their
clothes the moment they get into the "bush." That the natives of
hot climates dislike to encumber themselves with clothing, need
not excite our wonder; but that those of so cold a country as
Tasmania should likewise go without any covering, is passing
strange.</p>
<p>When the motley assemblage which had been collected, amounting
to about 3,000 persons, was arrived at the seat of war, it was
extended in a line over thirty miles of country, forming posts
very near each other, or farther asunder according to the nature
of the ground. Whenever the line halted, huts made of bark or
branches of trees were erected, and each occupied by three
persons, one of whom was always on duty as sentry. During the
night, besides a large fire close to each hut, there were two or
three kept up thirty or forty yards in front, so as to produce
rather a fine effect. From one of our stations we could discern
fifteen or sixteen of them, which caused a blaze that illumined a
great extent of forest. In the event of the blacks attempting to
force the line, or during its advance, shewing any inclination to
do battle, orders were given to fire, and drive them back, but
unless absolutely necessary in self-defence, not to kill them.
The signal for an enemy was the cry of "Look out," to be repeated
along the whole line. On the second night after I had joined the
array, we were aroused by the preconcerted war-cry, upon which we
stood to our arms, in the full expectation that the whole army of
the Paynim were upon us; as, in addition to the cry, we heard the
noise of musquetry.</p>
<p>We were soon relieved from our uncertainty, by hearing the cry
of "All's well," denoting, of course, that we had put the enemy
to the route. When the day dawned, it was ascertained that the
alarm had been given by some of the people, who had probably
heard an animal rustling through the bushes.</p>
<p>The ship in which my passage to England was secured, sailed
before the campaign had terminated. On my second visit to the
Island, I found that the result had been unsuccessful. Even the
roving parties sent in front of the line to scour the "bush" did
not fall in with a single native, although they perceived
indications of their having been recently in the neighbourhood.
What will be said in England to the fact, that among 1,500
convicts who were in the expedition, and a great number of whom
were armed with musquets, only <i>one instance of misconduct
occurred</i> during two months, the period they were out! One of
these men shewed an instance of <i>sang froid</i> rather unusual.
During the alarm alluded to above, he was mistaken for a native
and fired at; he remonstrated with the gentleman who fired for
being so precipitate, and concluded by saying, "and then to miss
me after all!"</p>
<p>It is imagined the native population does not exceed 2,000,
but it is impossible to form any correct idea of it. The fact,
however, that the males greatly exceed the females in number,
seems to have been pretty well established: and those who are
acquainted with them affirm, that they are at least six times as
numerous! Their language is musical and soft, abounding in
vowels, like the Italian. It is universally admitted in the
colony, that these children of the wilderness are not deficient
in courage, and are wont to show each other fair play, not
seeming at all inclined to avail themselves of any unfair
advantage. It is added, also, that when they meet with the
intention of fighting, it is the custom for one to receive a blow
on the cranium, and then to return the blow on that of his
adversary! How they arrange about precedence I was unable to
learn, but must confess I should like uncommonly, when so
engaged, to be permitted to strike first, if only to discover,
for the benefit of phrenologists, what description of bump could
be raised: by causing a development of that of benevolence, or a
depression of that of destructiveness, the effect might equally
operate in my favour. This fairness reminds me of the
ourang-outang on the banks of the Ganges, "which (Froger speaks)
will present a native with a stick and then compel him to fight,
as it scorns to profit by any accidental superiority!"</p>
<p>Their arms are spears, like those of the New Hollanders, and
waddies: the wommora, or throwing-stick, is unknown, so that they
throw the spear by the hand alone, and yet will strike a small
object at a distance of from forty to fifty yards. They use also
a stick about two feet in length, half an inch in diameter, and
pointed at one end. This, though not so dangerous a weapon as the
boomerang, is nevertheless a formidable instrument, as it is sent
with almost unerring aim, and with such force that any person
struck by it would receive a dangerous contusion, or even a
severe wound. It can be thrown with ease forty yards, and in its
progress through the air goes horizontally, describing the same
kind of circular motion that the boomerang does, with the like
whirring noise. The natives of the Radack Islands use a similar
weapon.</p>
<p>Through the exertions of several individuals, assisted by the
government, fifty or sixty of the aborigines were secured lately
and sent to Bass' Straits. In these Straits, as already stated,
arc a number of islands; it is on the principal of these, Great
Island, that the black settlement has been formed under the
superintendance of an officer of the regiment stationed at Hobart
Town. They are supplied with food and clothing, and land is
cultivated for them; and as there are kangaroos upon the island,
they are enabled to divert themselves with a little hunting. They
appeared quite contented and comfortable; and although, if it be
admitted, as some philosophers hold, that the most perfect state
of man is that in which he makes the nearest approach to nature,
these unsophisticated beings must have attained the utmost
extreme of perfectibility, it is not the less to be hoped they
will shortly become less perfect, more civilized, and ultimately
useful members of society.</p>
<p>The animals of Van Dieman's Land differ in some respects from
those of New Holland. The varieties of the kangaroo amount to
only three; and the native dog, koula, and sloth are not found in
the former, while the native tiger, or hyena opossum, as it is
absurdly called, and the native devil, are unknown in the
latter.</p>
<p>The colour of the native tiger (dog-faced dasyuris) is brown,
with a number of black stripes which extend across the back,
gradually taper to a point, and terminate near the belly; the
circumference of the body is only eighteen inches. It is
carnivorous, has a remarkable large mouth, destroys lambs, and
will eat offal; is slow in its movements, extremely cunning in
its nature, and is a night animal. Like the kangaroo, it goes in
tracks or paths beaten by that animal, or by its own kind, and
can be tamed with equal facility. The following were the
dimensions of one:&mdash;</p>

<p>Of the native devil (dasyuris ursinus) I saw only one
specimen: it was nearly entirely black, about the size of a
terrier, with a large head, a most formidable set of teeth, and
very short legs. It is entirely carnivorous, and is also the only
quadruped in these colonies that is untameable. The individual
alluded to had been two years in captivity, and was fierce as
ever. When provoked, it champed its teeth with great force,
making at the same time a noise not unlike that made by a bear.
This animal can exist a long time without food; the above, for
example, was <i>three weeks</i> without any. One writer says it
is covered with scales, and is the ugliest creature in existence;
the one I saw, was covered with hair, like that of a dog, and
<i>not</i> remarkable for ugliness.</p>
<p>The wombat is a singular animal, and when fall grown will
weigh nearly forty pounds. The largest that came under my
observation was thirty-two inches in length and twenty-four in
circumference; the fur is thick, very strong, and of a dark grey
colour. The legs are extremely short, the ears hardly visible,
the feet formed like those of a badger, and it has no tail. Its
mouth resembles that of a rabbit, with only four teeth in front.
The flesh has the flavour of that of a kangaroo, but is more
delicate. The food of the wombat consists principally of leaves
and grass; its movements are rapid; it burrows, and, in common
with the other quadrupeds of this island, is a night animal.</p>
<p>The ornithorynchus histrix, or porcupine, differs greatly from
that of New South Wales, and is the echidna setosa of
naturalists; it is larger, has not near so many spines or quills,
nor is the form the same. The flesh equals that of a fowl.</p>
<p>The ornithorynchus paradoxus is found in many of the streams,
and differs very slightly from that of New South Wales.</p>
<p>Some of the dogs introduced by the Colonists have become wild
(in all probability through the culpable neglect of their
owners), and have destroyed a great number of sheep: once fairly
established in the Colony, it would be in vain to attempt their
destruction, as there are tracts of "scrubby" country from which
it would be impossible to expel them.</p>
<p>Several kinds of animals resembling the weasel tribe in their
predatory habits, are peculiar to the island, and destroy great
numbers of poultry. The kangaroo, or opossum mouse, is a mouse
formed like a kangaroo, and is a very curious little animal; it
would appear to be rather scarce, as I never saw one, nor could
ever get a proper description of it.</p>
<p>Amongst the feathered race are emus, black and white
cockatoos, parrots, two kinds of magpies, laughing jackass,
hawks, eagles, the carrion crow, pelican, black swan, ducks,
teal, widgeon, etc., etc.; with quail, snipe, and bronze-winged
pigeons.</p>
<p>There are likewise several kinds of snakes,&mdash;two or three
of which are venomous&mdash;guanas, centipedes, scorpions, and
ants as large as those of New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is certainly a remarkable feature in the character of the
quadrupeds, and in many of the birds of these colonies, that they
can be so easily tamed. In other countries, both time and
attention are required to subdue the natural ferocity or wildness
of the animals, while here it is done without trouble, and in a
very short time. The kangaroo, wombat, and many others become
reconciled to captivity in the course of a day or two, and will
then follow a person like a dog. Even the native tiger and some
of the animals called native cats, can be reclaimed: the native
devil alone seems averse to quit its life of freedom to associate
with man.</p>
<p>Of their habits little, if any thing, is known in Europe; and
it is to be regretted that more attention has not been paid to
a subject that would not fail to afford considerable
interest.</p>
<p>Fish are more abundant on the coasts of Tasmania than near the
Australian capital, but the rivers of this island contain only
fish so small, that, compared to those, of Australia, they are
mere sprats. Black whales enter the bays in order to seek some
retired spot where they may bring forth their young, and during
that season become victims to the cupidity of the arch destroyer,
man. At no very distant period, few, if any, will be found on
these coasts, for the warfare kept up against them is so
incessant and destructive, that their numbers are already greatly
diminished. I witnessed the death of one (in 1830) nearly fifty
feet in length, in Storm Bay; and it certainly was a fine though
melancholy sight, to observe the huge creature pursued by six
boats, the rowers of which were all striving their utmost to
secure, the first stroke with the harpoon, as the boat which
first "gets fast," that is to say, strikes first, the harpoon at
the same time retaining its hold, is entitled to the animal.
After a sharp row of several miles, the harpooner ("headsman") in
the foremost boat "threw his iron," which became fixed. The
instant the whale felt the stroke it darted off with great
velocity, but had not gone far before it dived ("sounded"); on
rising again to the surface it began to spout blood and water to
the height of many feet, and to lash the water most furiously
with its tail ("fight with its fluke"); a very short time elapsed
before it died.</p>
<p>Spermaceti whales are not found on any part of the coasts. The
captain of a whaler told me, as a singular instance of instinct
in the shark, that wherever whales are seen, there likewise will
most assuredly be found the former. It is an undoubted fact, that
as soon as the whale has been brought alongside the ship, and the
operation of "flinching" or "cutting in" commenced, the sharks
claim their share by an immediate attack; and it may be taken for
granted that their appetites must be sufficiently ravenous, for
we never captured one with any thing in its stomach, save once,
when we found in it it two or three well-used quids of tobacco,
thrown overboard by some of our people. The captain of the whaler
had well nigh lost one of his men a few days before we spoke to
him (off New Zealand), a shark having taking a piece out of his
thigh while employed in fixing a hook in the whale, when
alongside.</p>
<p>Amongst other curious expressions used in the vernacular
jargon of sperm whalers, is that of "right fish," for it means
literally the <i>wrong one</i>, as it denotes the <i>black
whale</i>, which is not disturbed by them.</p>
<p>Vegetation is equally rapid in this colony as in Australia,
and the trees often attain a large size: not far from Hobart Town
there is an eucalyptus nearly sixty feet in girth; it is quite
hollow, with every prospect of flourishing for years to come. The
trees are ungainly, shoot up with vast stems, and scarcely any
branches; but where the cherry, mimosas, and one or two other
ornamental trees are seen, they take off greatly from the effect
caused by the uncouth appearance of the eucalyptus tribe. It is
from one of this tribe that the manna is procured, as noticed in
my remarks on Argyle; it is found on the ground in pieces none of
which are larger than a small bean, and more usually they do not
exceed the size of a pea; it often happens that they are still
more minute. The manna is white, and tastes like sweetened flour,
or rather like some kinds of sugar-plum. Some writers say it
dissolves immediately the sun is up, which is a mistake, for it
may be gathered in both colonies at any time of the day, in clear
or in cloudy weather: the greatest quantity that I ever collected
at one time was just after a smart shower of short duration. It
does not exude from the stem, but forms concretions on the leaves
and smaller branches, and is found in such trifling quantities
that it would never repay the trouble of collecting it.</p>
<p>The stringy bark seems to be the most valuable tree in the
colony, and there are several kinds of gum nearly equal to it;
the woods most esteemed by cabinet-makers are, the Huon pine,
black and silver mimosas, a species of cedar, and sassafras.</p>
<p>The trees are all evergreens, with that sombre hue which
prevails in New Holland, without a single lively tint, except
that of the native cherry, to break the monotony it causes.</p>
<p>There are some very handsome shrubs, and many beautiful
flowers; but in this respect it is quite inferior to the other
colony.</p>
<p>All the European trees thrive wonderfully well, and so
abundant was the fruit last year, that the quantity was immense.
It may well be said that no climate can be more congenial to the
growth of fruits than that of this island; and one great
advantage it possesses over Australia, is that, instead of
ripening at once as in the latter. (I do not speak of those which
are tropical,) they do so gradually, and in consequence a
plentiful supply may be had during many weeks. No tropical fruit
of any kind will grow in Van Dieman's Land.</p>
<p>Geraniums grow in all the unexposed parts of the island in the
open air, and frequently attain the height of eight or ten feet;
a small slip of the common red one will become a considerable
shrub in less than two years. I mention this plant to shew the
mildness of the climate.</p>
<p>All the English grasses succeed well, as do the various kinds
of grain; the wheat especially is considered of an excellent
quality, weighing generally sixty-two to sixty-four pounds the
bushel: Barley and oats will only thrive in good soil.</p>
<p>Apples, peaches and plums, grow with such rapidity, that the
shoots sometimes attain the length of six or seven feet (not
unfrequently more) in one season; and I was shewn a young pear
above six feet high, that had been produced from a <i>pip</i> put
into the ground twenty-two months before. Tobacco will grow well
enough; it is, however, very little attended to, only enough
being cultivated for the dressing of sheep.</p>
<p>Minerals are supposed to be numerous; but in the colonies so
little attention has been paid either to geology or mineralogy,
that the mere traveller who, like myself, has had no opportunity
of minutely exploring the country, is compelled to judge very
much by hearsay&mdash;an unsatisfactory mode of forming an
opinion upon these interesting subjects. All I could learn was,
that the following have been discovered:&mdash;namely, coal,
iron, copper, alum, etc., and petrifactions, particularly of
wood, are common and beautiful. Salt has also been procured from
water-holes on some of the plains, and in considerable
quantity.</p>
<p>Of all variable climates, that of the district of Hobart Town
is certainly the most changeable, the mutations being incessant.
Heat, cold, rain, and sunshine succeed each other with a rapidity
I never observed in any other part of the world. In winter, these
alternations, with the addition of hail and snow, follow each
other with equal celerity. Nevertheless, with all its faults, I
prefer it greatly to the climate of Sydney,* and am convinced it
is far more healthy. The winter of 1830 was considered
particularly inclement, yet the snow never remained on the ground
in and about the capital beyond a few hours.</p>
<p class="foot">[* It must be recollected that by the climate of
Sydney is meant that of the tract of country between the capital
and the Blue Mountains, say a space of about thirty miles
square.]</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the climate is influenced by the
proximity of Mount Wellington and other elevated land, the
weather being much more steady at a distance. At Swan Port such
is the case, and at places still nearer. At Sydney, the winter is
more agreeable; but there, during the summer, often for weeks
together, one observes an intensely blazing sky, without a
friendly cloud to afford a moment's relief to the eyes. This does
not so frequently occur at the Tasmanian capital.</p>
<p>On the <i>north</i> side of the island, the snow was (1830) of
considerable depth, and many days before it dissolved; but why
the cold should be greater there than on the <i>south</i> side,
is rather inexplicable. One would imagine that as Launceston is
not more elevated than the capital, the converse would have
happened.</p>
<p>It is not an uncommon opinion among the colonists, that the
climate has undergone some very important changes within the last
twelve years, having become more inconstant, and also
inclement.</p>
<p>Regular land and sea breezes prevail during the summer; and
hot winds sometimes occur, causing the thermometer to rise even
to 108 degrees. They blow from the north and north-west, and
rarely last any time; but during their prevalence, vegetation is
greatly blighted.</p>
<p>The island is not so subject to storms of thunder and
lightning as New South Wales; but sometimes, as in that country,
violent gusts of wind occur, which are so furious as to force
their way through a forest, making a road or path forty or fifty
yards wide, and extending to some distance.** The coasts are
visited by much boisterous Weather; and during some part of the
year gales are almost constant off Bass's Straits. As they blow
from the westward, the passage through from the eastward is
seldom attempted, captains of vessels preferring to go round the
island. One captain tried, for eighteen days to get through, but
was obliged to bear up and go to the southward. On the whole, the
climate may be considered a mild modification of that of England,
including its numerous vicissitudes. The average height of the
thermometer in summer is 70 deg.; and in winter from 40 deg. to
48 deg., though it rises higher for a day or two
occasionally.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The same havoc is caused in America by sudden
gusts which sweep off acres of trees in a minute.]</p>
<p>The children of this colony have a florid appearance not often
observed in New South Wales, and many of them are extremely
pretty. I am told they grow up plain, but know not how true this
is. On my remarking to a gentleman how good-looking the Tasmanian
children were, he replied, that "he thought them the ugliest set
of little brutes he had ever seen!" So much for the various
opinions of travellers.</p>
<p>I shall conclude these observations by a few remarks on the
medical topography of the island, written by my friend Dr. S.</p>
<p>"Van Dieman's Land is not less peculiar in this respect than
it is in its animal and vegetable productions, as situations are
here "enjoyed with health and pleasure, which any where else
would be considered inevitable destruction, or hazardous to human
life. And although the vicissitudes of the thermometer from heat
to cold, and of the barometer from clear weather to foul, are
frequent and sudden, they are not succeeded by the same baneful
consequences to the human body as in other countries; nor are
their changes followed by epidemic or contagious diseases, which
as yet can hardly be said to have appeared. Vaccine virus has
been introduced from the Isle of France and Sydney, but after
passing through one or two patients has become ineffective. The
diseases, both acute and chronic, are generally mild and of short
duration, and yield more easily to the visual remedies than in
any other country with which I am acquainted. It is to be
observed, that a great number of cases are brought on by
intemperance, partial clothing, and exposure to wet and cold, and
that they are mostly contracted by European prisoners of
dissolute habits or broken constitutions. The valetudinarian,
searching for health, will nowhere find a climate and country
more congenial to his feelings than Van Dieman's Land."</p>
<p>But if he seeks for amusement as well, in no place that I ever
visited will he find less of it</p>

<p><span class="aa">In</span> these regions, which pass through
all the varieties of climate included in an extent of
thirty-eight degrees, or 2,280 geographical miles, and are fitted
for yielding all the productions of the temperate and
inter-tropical climes, there is no question that the inhabitants,
in the course of time, will be enabled to supply themselves with
numberless comforts and luxuries which colonies less happily
situated are obliged to procure from distant parts. Even during
the brief period which has elapsed since their settlement, an
unexampled progress has been made, and with unlooked for success,
in respect to the location and cultivation of the land, as well
as the introduction and increase of animals and plants; the
exports are also increasing in a ratio that is extraordinary; the
powerful agency of steam has been brought into use, and through
the laudable exertions of numerous energetic individuals, the
immense resources of the colonies are gradually becoming
developed.</p>
<p>Many generations, however, will roll away before the country
can become thickly inhabited; for, in the first place, there are
vast tracts that, in all probability, will never be reclaimed so
as to yield any profit to the husbandman;* these intervene
between the fertile spots that are scattered through the
colonies; and, in some places, extend so far, that the traveller
may pass over fifteen or twenty miles, and scarcely see an acre
of good soil. Particular spots will (some have already) become
populous; and districts, once thinly inhabited by wandering
savages, are already covered with farms, where a multitude of
flocks and herds are seen; but these are far asander, and
peculiarly situated.</p>
<p class="foot">[* As for instance&mdash;Oxley describe the
country 260 miles west of Sydney to be hopelessly barren and
sterile: in fact it is a dreary and chilling waste; and so
utterly destitute of water that he was without any for 36 hours.
The land appeared to be parched by long continued drought.]</p>
<p>In the second place, the grants, or farms are of such
magnitude, that unless sub-divided, which from the nature of the
land, is not likely to happen, this alone would prevent the
country from becoming populated to the extent observed where the
land is more adapted for tillage than for pasturage. It is the
same in Southern Africa where there are tracts of land so arid,
that farms of 10,000 acres are not unfrequently supplied with
only water sufficient for the supply of one family.</p>
<p>Nature has distinguished New Holland and Van Dieman's Land by
a character so entirely their own, that their appearance as
already stated is totally different from that of every other
country; in both, the mountains are almost invariably rounded,
nor did I ever observe, save once, (near Mount Boorooan), an
elevation which terminated abruptly, in craggy, perhaps
inaccessible rocks; and in both, with the exception of the few
plains, all of which are some distance in the interior, the
entire country is one interminable forest, sometimes impervious,
but more frequently open, though, on the whole, more open in New
South Wales than in Van Dieman's Land. But the latter is not only
better watered, it possesses also, in proportion to its extent,
more harbours. Let the reader cast his eye over the chart of New
Holland and on its 6,000 miles of coast, he will find the number
very small; for omitting those on the north coast, there are not
more than four or fire that are commodious for large ships. As to
the west coast, with the exception of Shark's Bay, said to be
useless by reason of the deficiency of water, there does not
appear to be a harbour along its whole extent. It is a curious
fact that the western coasts of many countries labour under the
same disadvantage, and by reference to the charts it will be
seen, that in South America and Africa, the ports on the west
coasts are few in number and very indifferent: other parts of the
world are similarly situated.</p>
<p>Although some portions of New South Wales are picturesque, and
afford extensive and even magnificent prospects, the absence of
water, to which I have so often adverted, detracts so much from
the interest which the landscape would otherwise have excited,
that the effect is often dreary, triste, and monotonous, while a
river or lake would have rendered it quite the contrary; and
although its wilds are certainly decked with lofty trees and
luxuriant herbage, there is ever a gloominess by no means
consonant to the feelings of the traveller; such is not so much
the case in Van Dieman's Land.</p>
<p>The floods which occur may easily be accounted for; the ground
becomes indurated by drought and heat; a deluge of rain suddenly
descends, and instead of part of the water being imbibed by the
thirsty soil, the whole runs off, and rushes through the gullies
or beds of rivers, not only too narrow and tortuous to admit of
its flowing on without impediment, but the course of the torrent
is likewise interrupted by trunks and branches of trees, which,
by the accumulation of rubbish soon become dams.</p>
<p>I have said nothing respecting the government of the colonies,
and am not convinced if I gave a full account of it, that the
reader would be much edified; and as to the disputes about
juries, houses of assembly, etc. etc., the emigrant has nothing
to do with them; I shall therefore leave these matters to be
commented upon by the historian.</p>
<p>Of the public works of New South Wales, the principal are the
roads, which are a monument of perseverance and ability; though
not numerous they extend a great way, and two of them cross the
Blue Mountains. In Van Dieman's Land the only road, (if road it
can be called) is that to Launceston; it is barely: passable in
wet weather. At Hobart Town, however, a wharf is in progress, and
a few miles from it a bridge across the Derwent, both of which
will be creditable performances, though one would suppose that
the formation of roads to facilitate a communication throughout
the colony, would be of much greater present public utility, than
a wharf.</p>
<p>The churches are wretched specimens of taste and economy: that
of St. James at Sydney may be an exception (it is too small), but
those of the Dissenters, the two steeple nondescript at
Paramatta, and the only one at Hobart Town, are certainly no
great credit to the respective architects. The church now being
erected by the Catholics at Sydney will, when finished; be a
highly respectable edifice; but for want of funds it approximates
very slowly towards completion. The male and female orphan
schools near Hobart Town may be regarded as the handsomest
buildings in the colonies; with these exceptions, those of New
South Wales are greatly superior; particularly the hospitals.. It
may create some little surprise in the reader, when he is
informed, that in Van Dieman's Land, there are five "Academies,"
one. "Grammar School," and one "Seminary" for "Young Gentlemen;"
and three "Establishments," and eight "Seminaries for "Young
Ladies" in all eighteen. What the number is in the other colony,
I am not aware, but there are quite sufficient for the
population; and two colleges, the Australian and Sydney, were
being erected.</p>
<p>Of public amusements there, is a great paucity; races have
been long established; and at Sydney there is a theatre, where
the performance is tolerable. I believe the proprietor has sent
to England for a supply of actors and actresses; if he has not,
there is an opening for those who profess the histrionic
science!</p>
<p>To the great credit of the Tasmanians, boxing, that most
odious and brutal practice, has not yet been introduced; I wish
as much could be said for the Australians, with whom it seems to
be gaining ground, and principally amongst the native-born, who
ought to have shown more judgment, as well as taste, than to
adopt a diversion worthy only of savages.</p>
<p>Such are the public amusements: as to excursions into the
country, I have already said that the environs of Hobart Town
afford many more interesting rides and walks than those of
Sydney; for the Paramatta River, which is neither more nor less
than a branch or arm of the harbour, although some parts of it
are extremely pretty, is not to be compared with the Derwent; nor
the proportion of good soil within ten or fifteen miles of the
latter capital, to that within the same distance of the former.
This brings me to the subject of land, and "Land Regulations,"
with the latter of which I shall now make the reader acquainted:
the emigrant should study them well, and mature his calculations,
before he undertakes his voyage to the Antipodes.</p>
<p>By some they are considered highly judicious, and exactly the
contrary by others; the main objection appearing to be this, that
the charge of five shillings per acre for land, (immense tracts
of country are clearly not worth half the sum per acre,) no
matter how distant from a market, nor of what description the
nature of the soil may be, is extravagant. But there is another
objection of some moment, viz.: two persons arrive from England
with the view of becoming settlers: one proceeds at once into the
interior to seek for a location; while the other, in the mean
time, remains quietly at the capital. The first, having succeeded
in his object, returns, and makes the usual application that the
land may be put up to auction, of which due notice is given in
the government gazette, together with the name of the applicant.
When the sale takes place, the individual who has had no trouble
in exploring the country attends, and being of opinion that it is
better to pay something beyond the five shillings per acre, (he,
of course, takes it for granted that the applicant has secured a
location well worth the money,) than be reduced to the necessity
of passing many weeks in wandering about the "bush," bids against
him who had discovered the land in question, and not improbably
secures it. I do not mean to imply that this <i>has</i> been
done, but there is a liability of its happening; therefore, it
should be guarded against.</p>
<p>There is, however, one benefit derived from the change made in
the regulations, and it is, that every individual having now an
equal right to purchase, there can exist none of those
unjustifiable "Reserves" for persons of interest to occupy at
their leisure, which were formerly so common.</p>
<p>Not a few people suppose, that under existing regulations,
many persons will be deterred from emigrating, and certainly, I
have known instances of this having occurred; but whether they
will operate largely to prevent emigration, remains to be proved:
nor shall I venture to express an opinion upon a subject on which
the reader will be enabled to form one equally, or more correct,
than, any I could give myself. I understand the money procured by
the sale of land, is to be applied to the purpose of emigration.
If this be true, it will of course tend to increase the
population, but respectable settlers can gain nothing by it.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">LAND REGULATIONS.</p>
<p>"First&mdash;That all applications for the purchase of land
must be made in the prescribed form, addressed to the
surveyor-general, and obtainable only from that officer upon the
payment of</p>
<p>"Second&mdash;That <i>after three months' notice</i> the land
so applied for will be put up for sale by public auction
(<i>subject to all risks arising from any inaccuracy in the
description</i>), at a price of not less than five shillings per
acre. If estimated at a higher rate than five shillings, the
applicant will be duly apprized previous to the land being
advertized.</p>
<p>"Third&mdash;That, with the exception of special cases, each
lot so put up, will consist of one square mile, or 640 acres.</p>
<p>"Fourth&mdash;That the highest bidder must pay down a deposit
of ten per cent, at the time of sale, and the remainder of the
purchase money within one month, under penalty of forfeiting both
the land and the deposit.</p>
<p>Fifth&mdash;The crown reserves to itself the right of making
and constructing such roads and bridges as may be necessary for
public purposes, in all lands purchased as above, and also to
such indigenous timber, stone, and other materials, the produce
of the land, as may be required for making and keeping the said
roads and bridges in repair, and for any other public works. The
crown farther reserves to itself all mines of precious metals and
coal.</p>
<p>"Officers of the army, wishing to become settlers, shall, like
all other individuals, procure land only by purchase at the
public sale, but they shall be entitled to have a remission of
the purchase money to the following amount provided they shall
produce, from the general commanding in chief, satisfactory
testimonials of good conduct, and unexceptionable character,

will have a claim to any advantages under these regulations."</p>
<p>Without pretending to question the wisdom of these
regulations, I may be permitted to hazard an observation upon the
second. Let it be supposed that the emigrant has travelled to
some distant part of the colony, and that, having discovered and
selected land suitable for a farm or sheep-walk, he returns, and
applies to have it put up to auction. Of course no person would
wilfully purchase indifferent land at a high price; the
government being aware of this, the surveyor is directed to
inspect it, and, perhaps after the expiration of several weeks,
the emigrant receives due notice that the estimated value of the
land in question is <i>above</i> five shillings per acre. In
despair of finding, without great delay and manifest
inconvenience, another spot equally eligible, he is compelled to
pay the sum demanded. But, if from inability, or some other
reason, he objects to give beyond five shillings per acre, will
he not have to set out in search of another tract? and may not
the same disappointment occur to him more than once? Besides, is
it not apparently a hard case, that he should actually be obliged
to pay government for information gained by <i>his</i> toil and
activity, and not improbably at some expence? Such are the
arguments of many; however, I merely quote them as suggestions,
and leave the reader to judge if they are worthy of serious
attention.</p>
<p>The number of officers of the two professions absolutely
settled in New South Wales (some possess property in the colony
who do not reside in it), is stated at not less than fifty; but I
do not imagine there are quite so many. In Van Dieman's Land
there cannot be nearly that number.</p>
<p>The modes of clearing land are various: some persons cut down
and burn off every tree at once, without waiting until they are
dead, and without leaving even a few, under the shade of which
the cattle might shelter themselves from the intense heat of a
mid-day sun: the stumps are left to decay, and the land is
cultivated between them. Others employ a plan very commonly
practised in America; that is, a deep incision is made quite
round the tree (called girdling), which soon dies: and as it then
becomes quite dry, it is, when felled, consumed with great
facility.</p>
<p>There is another method which I did not see tried; it is said
to answer well, and is as follows: a hole, about six inches in
diameter, is made in that side of a tree against which the wind
is blowing at the time; on fire being applied, it communicates
with the heart (which I presume must be in a state of decay,)
involves the whole stem, which is soon destroyed; and any
branches or fragments that are left, are then heaped together and
also burnt! Such is asserted to be the case; but it certainly
does not follow, as a matter of course, that the stem will be
entirely consumed; for thousands of trees may be seen in the
forests only partially destroyed, some of them still throwing out
branches, and hundreds of them being hollow trunks, perfectly
black and scathed, and imparting a most repulsive solemnity to
the scenery; yet these trees have been more than once enveloped
by the flames of the destructive conflagrations which so often
occur.</p>
<p>When the stumps are left to rot, they remain a great number of
years, for even if not charred by the fires when burning off,
they will occupy a considerable space of time before they become
quite decayed. One advantage resulting from girdling the trees
and leaving them standing until ready for the axe, is, that the
use of the land is not lost in the meantime, as it can be
employed in grazing; but when the ground is strewed with fallen
trees, which are frequently cut down and then left for years
before they are burnt off, horses and cattle are liable to be
staked or otherwise injured.</p>
<p>"Where the stumps have not been eradicated, they constantly
throw out shoots, these become trees; four or five of which are
often the scions of a common parent, and all of them probably
many inches in diameter; but if girdling has been employed, I
believe this is not likely to occur, the roots (I speak under
correction,) and therefore the stump, perishing with the stem. As
these young forests increase, so must the ground from time to
time be cleared, a work of much trouble, for they are often very
dense; consequently it appears to me, that it would be preferable
to employ either the American method, or to clear the land
entirely, as it is wanted.</p>
<p>The expense of clearing land varies according to the
description of forest upon it, and to the district in which it is
situated: but before I enter upon this part of the subject, it
will be as well to premise; that, although the wages of free
labourers are apparently exorbitant, yet, when it is taken into
consideration, that (if at a distance from a town) they are under
the necessity of procuring every necessary they require from the
proprietor of the estate on which they are employed, who commonly
chaises thrice as much for an article as it costs himself, (a
previous agreement is made respecting this point,) their wages
are not so high as might be imagined, although still sufficiently
so.</p>
<p>If the soil is heavily timbered, as for instance in some parts
of Illawarra, where there are trees ten feet in diameter, to fell
one of which would occupy a man an entire day, the charge, I was
told, is sometimes 12<i>l</i>. per acre; for this sum the ground
will be brought in a state fit for cultivation. It is, however,
very rarely that so much is paid, and only where the soil is
concealed by an impervious "vine brush," the more usual charge
being from 2<i>l</i>. to 5<i>l</i>.; but this naturally depends
upon circumstances. The charge for going over land with a hoe, in
order to collect in heaps all the rubbish, fragments of roots,
etc. etc. is 12<i>s</i>. per acre.</p>
<p>In making a purchase, the emigrant should be careful to
secure, if possible, a "back run;" that is to say, a tract of
land, which, being behind his own farm, and without water, (such
are many of the hills, which afford a good supply of herbage,) is
not likely to be taken by any other person; and he will easily
perceive the necessity of this, when he is informed that,
speaking generally, three acres are required to feed two sheep.
There are particular spots which will undoubtedly supply food for
a greater number than the above proportion; though many settlers
of repute, stated it as the average throughout the colonies. I
have certainly heard of farms on which the herbage is so
luxuriant, that only one acre was required for each sheep: but
the finest estate I have seen in either colony, is calculated to
admit of not more than five sheep to seven acres, at least, such
was the prevalent opinion; besides, a certain portion of the
estate must be cultivated, and the horses, milch cows, and
working bullocks, must be fed.</p>
<p>As the settler will naturally devote his attention chiefly to
the production or cultivation of those articles which make the
highest returns, such as wool, salted meat, and cheese, he will
find, that in addition to his purchase, which could be used as a
homestead, presuming it to contain only 2,560 acres, (four square
miles, or the old maximum grant,) he will still require
additional land, to obtain which there are three ways of
proceeding: he can purchase or rent a tract either from the
government, or from an individual; he can also select a "stock
station" in some part of the colony where the land is either
unlocated, or being beyond the limits of that portion of the
country at present open to location, will not, probably, for some
time, become so. This is a very common expedient, but it is one
that is also only temporary, as the occupier may be compelled to
quit the land at a moment's warning.</p>
<p>There are likewise in the colony persons called "squatters,"
(the term is American,) who are commonly, it may be said always,
of the lowest grade. These men establish themselves on some
unlocated spot, where they cultivate enough land to supply them
with grain, and not unfrequently pilfer whatever else they
require, from the neighbouring farms. The only mode by which they
can be dislodged is to purchase the land of government; they can
then be warned off or ejected by force.</p>
<p>No emigrant ought, on any account, to purchase a property
until he has quite resolved upon remaining in the colonies; for
unless more fortunate than purchasers of land generally are, he
will experience very great difficulty in disposing of it, without
sustaining considerable loss.</p>
<p>I may here observe that unlocated land within 200 miles of
Sydney, and throughout Van Dieman's Land, is becoming so scarce,
that ere long the emigrant will have to seek for it at a most
inconvenient distance in the interior of the one colony, and will
be hardly able to find any in the other. This alone will show him
of what consequence it is not to lose time in embarking as soon
as possible after his mind is finally made up with respect to his
expatriation; in short, to sum up in a few words, all that can be
said on this subject, I do not hesitate to inform all those who
intend to become settlers, that if they wish to avail themselves
of the present advantages arising from the low prices of stock,
etc., they have not a moment to throw away upon
procrastination.</p>
<p>They will naturally wish to know what capital is required to
form a <i>respectable</i> establishment; and although I cannot
enter into all the minutiæ of the calculation (nor would a detail
thereof be of any utility,) yet by being made acquainted with the
principal expenses at the outset, they will be enabled to
approximate so near the truth, that, with the addition of a
farther sum for any unexpected contingencies, it cannot be very
far from the amount.</p>
<p>Let it be assumed that the emigrant purchases what was
formerly termed a maximum grant (2,560 acres,) and he could not
do with less, the cost at five shillings per acre, would be
640<i>l</i>. If a "back run" is secured, it will make a very
material difference in the value of the purchase, as a person who
possesses two or three thousand, or even only a few hundred
acres, may yet, independent of his own property, have a run for
his sheep or his cattle many miles in extent. If one is not
secured the above quantity of land will not be sufficient.</p>
<p>The charge for a fence of four bars is four shillings per rod,
or sixteen feet; and if the farm did not exceed a maximum grant,
the whole would doubtless be inclosed, besides which, there must
be stock (farm,) yards, a garden, and paddocks. A hundred acres
would not, I think, be more than sufficient for the supply of the
household, if there be a family, with grain, garden produce, etc.
etc. If properly cleared and cultivated, the whole expense would
be nearer 4<i>l</i>. than 3<i>l</i>. per acre, and probably
exceed the former sum. The settler would have likewise to
purchase working bullocks, cows, and several horses. Of the first
he will need at the least ten; but if he resides in the interior,
and sends his wool or cheese to the capital in his own drays,
double that number will not more than suffice. Of the second,
from fifteen to thirty would not be too many for the consumption
of the establishment, if the servants are allowed milk instead of
tea And sugar.</p>
<p>No respectable settler intending to devote his attention
principally to the growth of wool would, I suppose, commence with
less than 500 sheep; for these, if of a good quality, he would
pay £250, exclusive of any incidental expenses in sending them up
the country, etc. There are persons in the colonies who will not
dispose of a superior wooled sheep for less than £1 each.</p>
<p>A neat cottage of five rooms would cost, up the country, if
built by contract, about £150; but the expense of the hut erected
by the majority of the settlers, and which is often their only
habitation during a number of years, is very trifling, as it is
built with slabs of wood cut on the spot, and the interstices
filled up with clay. Out buildings, however, are more costly, as
they must be of more solid materials, and also much larger; the
outlay on these will of course depend on the settler himself.</p>
<p>On a review of these items, after making due allowance for the
difference between the apparent and real price of labour, the
result of the profits on the necessaries supplied to the
work-people, and bearing in mind that provisions and clothing for
the servants, implements of husbandry, furniture, and a variety
of articles too numerous to be mentioned here, must likewise be
procured, the total amount of the expenditure would scarcely be
under £2000, say from that to £2,500. The reader must not forget
that I speak of a <i>really respectable farm</i>. There are
numerous settlers who dispense with every comfort; their
furniture consists of a table, made on the spot, two or three
rude chairs, a bed, and a few articles used for culinary
purposes; their "fare consists of fresh and salted meat, with
damper (cake made of flour and water, and baked in the embers),
and their beverage is milk or tea. Thus they vegetate during many
years, regardless of the comforts and most of the conveniences to
which they had previously been accustomed. An emigrant who is at
all anxious that his family should enjoy a few of these will find
that, in stating as an adequate capital the sum of from £3,000 to
£4,000, I have made a calculation moderate rather than otherwise.
In Van Dieman's Land especially, I do not see how a smaller sum
can admit of a person doing <i>much</i> with respect to farming;
and by reference to the prices of provisions, cattle, horses,
sheep, etc. etc., the reason will appear sufficiently
evident.</p>
<p>Any one, however, not in possession of the above sum, who
nevertheless wishes to become a settler, has only to make his
calculations accordingly, and purchase less land and fewer cattle
and sheep; but in that case; he must be contented to remain some
years before he will derive much profit from his farm.</p>
<p>There are persons who fancy that a very small capital will, as
a matter of course, enable them to accumulate a large fortune in
a brief period of time. It Is certainly true that many who
commenced the world without a shilling are now in possession of
affluence. But these were not farmers; they were merchants, and
persons who retailed goods at Sydney and Hobart Town; and amassed
money in a very different way from that in which the mere settler
must expect to realize a competence. Those of the last
description, who have done well, have passed many years in the
colonies, have exerted their industry and energy to the utmost;
and have availed themselves of the advantages derived from the
sale of their stock at a time when the prices were extremely
high.</p>
<p>It must likewise be recollected, that the period When a tract
of land could be secured on the easy terms formerly admitted, is
now passed; nor can the same be the case again, unless a change
take place in the regulations, if the same price had been
demanded for land some years since, as at present, a very small
number of persons probably not one) could have afforded to pay
for the extensive grants they possess&mdash;some of them
containing from 10,000 to 30,000 acres, (I include all the farms
of a settler no matter how distant from each other) for which a
sum of not less than from £2,500 to £7,500 would have been
required.</p>
<p>By purchasing a farm, on which some improvements have been
made, the emigrant would not only save much valuable time&mdash;a
point of great consequence; but another most material
consideration would be this, that instead of being compelled to
go a long way from any market, and there have to encounter, at
the commencement of his new line of life, the numberless
discomforts and privations concomitant on the profession of an
incipient settler, he would find a hut or cottage, a garden, and
several other conveniences, which would conduce greatly to make
him contented, and very probably reconcile him to a residence in
the "Bush." Not a few who have been obliged by circumstances to
establish themselves in a vast forest, far from any neighbour,
and with neither medical nor any other assistance within reach of
them, become disgusted with the change, and then bewail their lot
in being entirely shut out from society.</p>
<p>To give some idea of the serious loss of time as well as of
the great trouble caused by being far removed from a magistrate
alone, I need only state, that when a convict servant misconducts
himself, the settler must either send the vagabond to the nearest
magistrate, not improbably some <i>thirty</i> or <i>forty</i>
miles distant, or he must overlook the offence.</p>
<p>I am thoroughly persuaded, that (under existing
circumstances), so far from entailing upon himself any extra
expense by purchasing a farm improved to a certain extent, the
settler will save by it; for an estate of this description is
almost always to be had at a reasonable price, even in good
situations. A fine farm on a river, not far from water carriage,
and containing 2000 acres, with a cottage and out-buildings upon
it, was sold for £1,600, <i>which was not more than the
improvements had cost</i>.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for persons who do not reside in the
colonies, but who, from the nature of their professions, pay them
transient visits, to purchase cattle and sheep, which they leave
in charge of an overseer. This plan is liable to numerous
objections, and sometimes causes serious loss; for even if left
"on thirds," that is, where the person who has the care of them
receives one-third of the produce, (occasionally he gets the
half), it does not follow that it will always answer, as this
must depend entirely upon the man left in charge, who
<i>ought</i> to be a man of undoubted honesty; a <i>rara avis in
terris</i> not to be found every day.</p>
<p>I could instance several persons who have lost considerably by
adopting the plan, but do not feel myself authorized to point
them out.</p>
<p>Respecting those who not being settlers or merchants ate
likely to succeed in the colonies, there is no doubt whatever
that mechanics of every description are certain of finding as
much employment as they can require: for respectable tradespeople
there are also some openings, though their profits will not equal
those of their predecessors, a good many of whom, and nearly the
whole of the merchants, keep their carriages. Bailiffs or
overseers are likewise wanted; so are those who understand the
breaking of horses.</p>
<p>Good servants, especially those of the gentler sex are in
great request; those free women sent out not long since by the
government, having proved no great acquisition, except by
increasing the population. This is a bold assertion; but my
information proceeds from highly reputable sources.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Several vessels have recently proceeded to the
colonies, with free females; and it is hoped these will be found
more tractable, and better disposed.]</p>
<p>Of the children who were also sent out, some have conducted
themselves well, and many of them indifferently.</p>
<p>It is really inconceivable how difficult it is to procure
steady servants, or work people; as they all seem to be of
opinion that the great charm of life consists in getting drunk as
often as possible; and unfortunately spirits are so cheap that
they can constantly indulge themselves in their inclination.
There are servants, who, though in every other respect most
commendable in their conduct, were yet entirely untrustworthy
through this abominable propensity. Such too is the case with a
large proportion of the mechanics, men who have it in their power
to lay by considerable sums from the profits of their labours,
and to make no contemptible provision for their families; but who
prefer instead, to waste their substance in inebriation at the
public houses: they seem determined to take no heed of the
morrow, eating and drinking as much as possible on the one day,
for fear I presume, of dying on the following!</p>
<p>In New South Wales those employed in fencing, if very
diligent, will sometimes earn as much as 16<i>s</i>. <i>per
diem</i>; and even those not remarkable for activity can gain ten
shillings. Two of these men commonly form a partnership, and they
find this plan preferable to working separately.</p>
<p>Good mechanics will not work in Sydney, nor I believe, in the
country, for less than eight shillings those of an inferior
description receiving from three shillings and sixpence to five
shillings <i>per diem</i>. It must, however, be understood that
by the piece or job, they are able to earn twice, or even three
times as much; so that it is only when not thus engaged, that
they will accept of the above wages. Sawyers charge twelve
shillings for 100 square feet of plank.</p>
<p>In Hobart Town a first-rate mechanic will not work for less
than ten shillings <i>per diem</i>; and the common charge is from
seven to nine shillings. But the artisans of New South Wales have
one great advantage over those of Van Dieman's Land; for as meat
is sold in the former at from two-pence half-penny to three-pence
per pound, and in the latter at from five-pence to nine-pence, it
results that, at Hobart Town, it is never less than double, and
often three, or even nearly four times as dear.</p>
<p>I cannot say what the <i>average</i> price of wages throughout
the year would be; a well-informed mechanic, who went out in the
same ship with myself, said he could not earn more than two
pounds per week. As he was a sensible man, and also skilful in
his trade, I shall consider him, in a great measure, a fair
criterion by which to judge of the value of labour, and assume,
as the <i>present</i> wages of a good mechanic (1833), from one
pound fifteen shillings to two pounds five shillings per week in
Sydney, and probably ten shillings more in Hobart Town.</p>
<p>Stone-masons and coopers have in some instances been paid, at
the latter town, as high as twelve shillings <i>per diem</i>;
this was only on particular occasions, the wages of work-people
ever fluctuating; for when I was in Tasmania, in October, 1830, a
cooper might have demanded, and got, much more than that sum.</p>
<p>It is from this uncertainty that I am precluded from stating
any positively fixed or average annual sum, and shall therefore
simply remark, that as meat, and several, it may be said most
other, necessaries of life (with tea and sugar), are much cheaper
than in England; as there are no taxes, and as the wages are
quite adequate payment for the labour, the artisan will doubtless
be induced to admit that, in a pecuniary point of view, he would
be much better off in Australasia than in any part of the United
Kingdom.</p>
<p>One striking circumstance in the colonies is the almost entire
absence of paupers: very few are seen at Sydney&mdash;none at
Hobart Town; and those at the former are most probably idle and
profligate characters, who are too lazy to gain an honest
livelihood by working. The squalid misery, and dreadful state of
destitution so common in our own islands, is never observed in
these regions; nor is the eye offended, nor the mind harrowed, by
the shocking scenes so frequently witnessed in all countries that
are in a high state of civilization! The reason is obvious; where
the population is small, and the price of labour high, no one
need perish through want, as work is always to be found; but
where the population is dense, there also will be, of a
necessity, numbers unable to procure employment, and, who
consequently, die of starvation, or through disease, generated by
the pernicious nutriment which hunger compels them to extract
from bad or unnatural food.</p>
<p>I know not how to account for there being such a difference
between the two capitals in regard to affluence: the settlers in
Tasmania, speaking generally, seem to have gone on quite as well
as, probably better than, those in Australia: yet there is no
comparison between the (<i>apparent</i>) fortunes of many of the
inhabitants of Sydney, and of those of Hobart Town. Even making
every possible allowance for the superior opportunities of
realizing money, which the merchants and tradespeople of the
former have enjoyed, it is still surprising that the disparity
should be so very considerable! It is seen in every thing; style
of living, equipages, and buildings.</p>
<p>Several causes combined to occasion the partial ruin of a
portion of the settlers in, Australia, and one appears to have
arisen from their having incautiously acted on the supposition,
that the high prices of stock would have always continued, which
induced them to go on increasing their flocks and herds, until
the number became prodigious; when, as might have been expected,
the supply being greatly superior to the demand, the value fell,
comparatively speaking, to almost nothing.</p>
<p>The principal cause, however, of the distress, was that
dreadful drought of 1826, 1827, 1828, and 1829: an extract from
the Sydney Almanack, for 1830, will explain the matter better
than I can. "The operation of the distress among the settlers was
twofold; it obliged them to make purchases at an excessive price,
of imported bread corn (the entered value of grain, flour, and
potatoes, imported in 1828 alone, was £54,823) for the support of
their households and establishments; and in order to raise the
funds for these purchases, it compelled them to make forced sales
of their live stock at a most unfortunate crisis. For, as the
distress was confined to no one district, the competition of
sellers became as great as the competition of buyers had been;
and the consequence of this reaction was, to sink the prices of
stock as much below their natural level as ever they had been
raised above it. This depression was also materially assisted by
a cause less to be expected than either the fall in the price of
our flocks and herds, which finds its vent within the colony, or
the severe drought which accelerated that fall; namely, by the
alteration in the value of wool in the London market. This almost
exclusive article of export on which the settler had as yet
calculated, and which he fondly hoped would always maintain a
permanent or increasing value, had fallen from fifty to
seventy-five per cent, and it only wanted this to make the
depreciation of property complete."</p>
<p>The distress is at an end; and it is to be hoped there will be
no recurrence of such a calamitous period.</p>
<p>It is a circumstance greatly to be deplored when persons who,
during a series of years, have exerted themselves to the utmost,
and are going on with every prospect of soon realizing an
independence, are unexpectedly reduced by fortuitous events, over
which they had no control, to even a worse condition than when
they commenced their labours; but in a country so liable to
suffer from drought, it behoves every settler to be as
circumspect as possible, and to display his foresight, by
providing, as far as he can, against an evil which, in all
probability, will sooner or later assail him; though certainly we
can hardly expect that so long a drought as the last will happen
more than once in half a century. That the value of stock will
increase, particularly as soon as the curing of meat is perfectly
understood, at all events, that it cannot decrease, is a very
prevalent opinion, though it will never again be so valuable as
it was a few years since.</p>
<p>It is quite out of my power to give any advice as to which
colony the emigrant had better proceed, nor, in fact, should I be
justified in attempting it. By what I have said of Swan River he
will readily perceive how impossible it is to give a true and
impartial account of <i>that</i> settlement; of the other two it
may perhaps be as well to notice here a few of their comparative
advantages, although some of them have already been alluded to;
this will enable any person in some measure to judge which of
them would constitute the more desirable residence.</p>
<p>New South Wales possesses a climate certainly more adapted for
the production of wool, as well as other articles of export: and
as it varies according to the district or locality, so every tree
and plant that will thrive in Van Dieman's Land, and a great
number that will not, will do well in Australia.</p>
<p>The proportion of unlocated land, and facility of finding it,
are far more considerable.</p>
<p>The settler will for many years have more considerable runs
for his flocks and herds; and the country is more open. Finally,
he can select that district the climate of which is most
congenial to his feelings.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tasmania is not liable to suffer either
from the droughts or floods, which cause such calamitous effects
in the other colony; nor to such a degree from hot winds. In
whatever part of the island the settler may locate himself, he
can hardly be above seventy or eighty miles from water
carriage.</p>
<p>The crops are not nearly so liable to fail; the soil is
commonly more fertile, and also more favourable to the growth of
English grasses, arising chiefly from the heat of the climate
being so much less intense.</p>
<p>There prevails in England a great degree of ignorance
respecting these colonies, and of all that concerns them. Many
persons have formed their estimation of the profits that would
accrue to them from a location there, from some work teeming with
laudatory observations on the wealth of the country, the
independence of the settlers, the interest of money, the
excellence of the soil, and a variety of other advantages; on
their arrival, they have discovered that there exist certain
drawbacks which the author, of course through inadvertency, had
omitted to notice. I. have slightly glanced at some of these, nor
do they, on the whole, make a very formidable array; but they
ought to be stated in every work, and perhaps it will be as well
to embody them here, so that the reader may perceive at once
whether they are of sufficient consequence to counterbalance the
benefit derived from becoming a settler; premising, however, that
if any one is so unreflecting as to fancy, that in establishing
himself in a new country, where all around him is in a state of
nature, there will be no difficulties to contend with, he would
do well to remain at home; for with such an opinion he would
inevitably meet with considerable disappointment, and discontent
would assuredly follow.</p>
<p>First&mdash;The chief objection may be considered, the immense
distance of the colonies from the mother country, which renders
it almost out of the question for a family man to think of ever
revisiting his paternal soil; he may therefore conclude, the
moment he has established himself upon his farm, that he has bid
an eternal farewell to all his friends and relations at home, and
to the places endeared to him from his earliest infancy. To a
person of reflection and feeling, there is something almost awful
in the contemplation of meeting no more, on this side of the
grave, the friends of his youth, or the connexions he has formed
in his riper age; and although we are told, that all places are
distant alike from heaven, and that, to a wise man, it does not
signify in what part of the world he may be, yet, when the
emigrant finds himself amongst strangers, not one of whom is
concerned for his welfare, he will experience a sensation which
will throw a damp on his present situation, and tend materially
to cloud his future prospects.</p>
<p>Second&mdash;In the "bush" it is seldom that settlers are near
enough to each other to make those reciprocal and friendly calls,
or visits, which tend so much to preserve a good feeling and
fellowship amongst neighbours in more populous countries.
Consequently, society is almost nominal, and very many months
will sometimes elapse without the wife of the settler seeing a
female countenance, save those of her servants.</p>
<p>Third&mdash;However beneficial the convict population may be
to the colonists, there is something extremely unpleasant in the
idea of being surrounded by convict servants; for though they not
unfrequently conduct themselves as well as our people at home,
every article of any value must be under lock and key; and such
is often their propensity to theft, especially as regards the
women, (I am sorry to give such an unfavourable account of the
sex, but the truth will out), that nothing is secure; nor can any
confidence with safety be placed in them; besides which, the
settler may expect at times to encounter no small trouble and
vexation from their obstinacy and impertinence. In common
justice, however, to them, I may add, that, in some respect, our
servants at home pilfer from their masters to an infinitely
greater extent, and often give them much more trouble.</p>
<p>Fourth&mdash;The emigrant may take it for granted, that unless
his capital enable him to purchase a farm, so situated as to be
within reach of a market, he will be compelled to establish
himself at a spot not improbably from one hundred and fifty miles
to two or three times that distance from the capital, whence his
supplies must nevertheless be procured; whereby not only
considerable loss of time is caused, but great inconvenience in
many other respects.</p>
<p>Fifth&mdash;The existing regulations concerning the granting,
or more properly speaking, sale of land.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the advantages; if not numerous, they are,
at least, of some magnitude.</p>
<p>First&mdash;The interest of money lent on mortgage, varies
from ten to twelve and a half per cent., but the latter may
easily be procured; this will, most probably, be the case for the
next five years or more, and eight per cent, during a number of
years afterwards. Therefore, a person who possesses a capital of,
say 4000<i>l</i>. from which he derives in England only from
140<i>l</i>. to 200<i>l</i>. per annum, would here be able to
secure, for a time, an income of from 400<i>l</i>. to
500<i>l</i>. per annum.</p>
<p>Second&mdash;The climate of these regions, notwithstanding the
droughts and hot winds, is far superior to that of the Canadas;
at all events, it is better adapted for wool and many other
productions.</p>
<p>Third&mdash;The settler has nothing to do with taxes, tithes,
poor rates, or parish business of any kind; matters which at home
occasion considerable inconvenience and discontent.</p>
<p>Fourth&mdash;Provisions of every description are plentiful,
and extremely cheap.</p>
<p>Fifth&mdash;Servants are not nearly so expensive as at home;
and from the variety of their trades, the settler can generally
calculate upon making, upon his own estate, almost every article
he may require.</p>
<p>The preceding observations apply equally to the two colonies;
with this exception, that in Van Dieman's Land servants are
comparatively expensive, and the price of provisions is not lower
than in England.</p>
<p>It has been recommended by one writer, that two or more
persons should combine their means, and form a copartnership. The
inconveniences attending such, a plan are so obvious, and the
liability to disagree so great, that I shall make no remarks upon
it; contenting myself with strenuously advising all those about
to emigrate, not to try the experiment, unless with their nearest
relatives;&mdash;even then, the result will be extremely
precarious. I could have extracted, from various authors, much
useful information concerning agricultural pursuits, but have
thought, it better to leave the emigrant to peruse their works
himself. And I have also refrained from giving an opinion upon
such an important point as expatriating one's self; for it is
quite impossible to comprehend fully the views of every person
who may determine on quitting Europe.</p>
<p>There are many who regret having gone to the colonies; and
there are also many who have greatly improved their circumstances
by settling there.</p>
<p>A person who proposes to emigrate, can hardly fail of forming
a tolerably correct judgment as to the several colonies, if he
will but compare the different authors who have written on them,
and then consider dispassionately the respective advantages and
disadvantages; at the same time taking especial care, that he
does not allow himself to be led away by those bright illusions,
and Utopian ideas, so liable to be generated by the natural
tendency most men have, to believe all they hear on the subject
of amassing riches!</p>
<p>Once on his grant, the emigrant will soon perceive his
comforts and conveniences increase; that is to say, if he
possesses common industry and perseverance, and avoids falling
into the hands of the money-lenders; but it should always be
borne in mind, that the life of a settler is far more adapted for
married people than for those who are single. A great portion of
the life of an unmarried man, who is located at a distance in the
interior, must necessarily be consumed in solitude; nor will its
even tenor be broken in upon, unless by the casual visit of some
unexpected traveller. His vacant hours roll heavily along; and
before the close of each succeeding day, he not improbably often
sighs after the blessings of the matrimonial life, and wishes for
some congenial mind with which to interchange his thoughts. There
are individuals who have passed years in this secluded and
apparently comfortless state, only informed of passing events in
the busy world by an occasional brief visit to the capital; but
as I doubt much if most persons would not soon tire of it, unless
they possessed great energy, and a peculiar way of thinking, I
would, by no means, recommend the trial, except to those who have
pondered well the consequences of thus separating themselves from
society. They should reflect that, when immured in deep solitude,
such objects as a dismal forest, and cheerless hills, are very
apt to diffuse a gloom over the fancy, which, however compatible
with one's occasional feelings, cannot fail to tincture the
thoughts in the hour of silence and loneliness. It is
extraordinary to observe the greater cheerfulness frequently
found in the weaker sex; at Swan River in particular, the wives
of the settlers were constantly trying to persuade their husbands
that all would eventually be well, and the various difficulties
and privations but temporary!</p>
<p>Many of the ladies who went there deserve the most unqualified
praise; and so do most (I should not be far wrong if I said
<i>all</i>), of those who reside in Australia and Van Dieman's
Land; and it is with no small pleasure that I avail myself of
this opportunity of bearing testimony to their excellent conduct,
in striving to render the labours of their husbands as light as
possible, by smoothing the numerous obstacles both have to
encounter, when establishing themselves in a new country, and
entering upon an entirely new kind of life.</p>

<br>
<p>I shall now take leave of the reader, with the hope that I
shall be found to have omitted touching on no point of material
interest or importance to the emigrant. It would have been easy
to enter into more lengthened details, but my object has been to
condense my work as much as possible, so as to render it
compendious, and within the reach of the ordinary class of
persons who propose becoming settlers.</p>
<p>Should my remarks be found desultory and unconnected, and my
style obnoxious to the refined critic, I am at least guiltless of
having held out any extravagant expectations; and however
gratifying it might be to my feelings, should these pages be
thought worth the perusal of the general reader, still I must
repeat that for the emigrant are they specially intended. For him
have I ventured this my first feeble essay in authorship, amply
rewarded if I should be instrumental in removing any of the
misapprehensions respecting the colonies, occasioned by the
conflicting accounts now in circulation, and if I should have
assisted him in forming his plans and arrangements, by rendering
him more familiarly acquainted with those scenes and objects,
among which his lot is to be in future cast.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>
<p><span class="aa">In</span> addition to what I have already
stated of the great dread in which the devil or evil principle is
held by savages, the following curious instances of superstition
may not, perhaps, be thought uninteresting. The inhabitants of
the Nicobar Isles, at the entrance of the Gulf of Bengal, have no
notion of a God, but they firmly believe in the devil, and
worship him from fear. If they observe signs of an approaching
storm, they imagine that the devil intends them a visit, upon
which many superstitious ceremonies are performed. When a man
dies, all his property is buried with him (as in New Zealand);
and his wife must conform to custom by having a joint cut off
from one of her fingers.</p>
<p>The Pagan Mandingoes believe in one God, the Creator of all
things, whom they consider as of a nature much too exalted above
human affairs to give attention to their prayers. The Arrawaks, a
tribe of Guiana, have neither priesthood nor form of worship;
they say it is unnecessary to address the Creator, for as he is
supremely just, he will not give any one undue precedence on
supplication, neither will he willingly afflict his creatures.
They attempt by incantations to propitiate the evil spirit.</p>
<p>In Otaheite the body of a person deceased is placed beneath a
shed, open at one end and formed of a kind of wicker work, upon a
bier or frame of wood, supported by four posts at the height of
about four feet from the ground. When the bones are stripped of
their flesh and become dry, they are buried with great ceremony.
In the Fox Islands, situated in the sea of Kamtschatka, the
bodies of the rich are put into a small boat, which is suspended
upon poles placed cross-wise; the body is then left to rot in the
open air. Here we observe a custom resembling one among the New
Zealanders, and the natives of Moreton Bay.</p>
<p>If it be true that the women of New Holland have been observed
deprived of a finger, it is not improbable that a custom common
to the Friendly Islands may also prevail in Australia. It is
supposed by the Islanders, that the Deity will accept of a little
finger as a sort of sacrifice efficacious enough to procure the
recovery of their health: they cut it off with a stone hatchet;
and there appeared to be scarcely one in ten who was not thus
mutilated in one or both hands. According to Captain King, it is
common also for the inferior people to cut off a joint of the
middle finger on account of the sickness of the chiefs to whom
they belong. Or the women of Australia may amputate their fingers
in consequence of the death of their husbands, as do those of the
Nicobar Isles.</p>
<p>The New Hollanders are not the only people who entertain
peculiar notions respecting the dead; but it would be of no great
utility to notice more than one or two instances of superstitious
credulity with regard to those who have it no longer in their
power to acknowledge a benefit nor to resent an injury. The
friends of a Laplander are very loth to attend him in his last
moments; the desceased is therefore placed in his coffin by a
person selected for the purpose; but the last takes care to
secure himself from any ill offices of the manes, by a
consecrated brass ring fixed on his left arm. The Yacuti, or
Socha, a Tartar tribe that originally descended into Siberia from
the high regions of the south, never mention the dead, unless
allegorically, and forsake the hut in which any one has expired.
The Abyssinians are extremely credulous touching Genii, or evil
spirits, that go about doing mischief in the dark. Hence, they
are afraid of moving about, but especially of fighting in the
night time; because they imagine that the world is then entirely
given up to these beings, who are put out of humour by the
motions of men, or of any other terrestrial animals. I believe
the New Hollanders never fight after night fall.</p>
<p>When the negroes of some parts of Africa suspect, or rather
have been induced by their priest to suspect, that a person has
died in consequence of sorcery, they interrogate the corpse,
which they imagine gives an answer in the affirmative, by
impelling forward the persons who bear it, and the negative by a
rolling motion. The person accused is seized and sold into
slavery, and sometimes also his whole family. If of no value as a
slave, he is compelled to dig his own grave, into which he is
thrust; the earth is then thrown over him, and a stake is driven
through his body.</p>
<p>This notion certainly differs from the idea entertained by the
New Hollanders, but the difference is not essential, as in both
cases, where a person dies, another is accused of having caused
his death; in the one instance, entirely through the machinations
of some personal enemy amongst the priesthood, and in the other,
from some cause with which we are unacquainted, though not
improbably from that inherent pugnacity forming so conspicuous a
trait in the character of dogs and men.</p>
<p>From these few observations, it will be seen that a singular
resemblance is frequently found to exist between the habits and
customs of the most distant tribes; and it would undoubtedly
prove highly interesting to peruse a comparison between the
religious ideas of all the various nations of this terrene world
of ours.</p>
<p>Subsequently to sending my manuscript to press, I have read an
extract from a recent work, which states that a mechanic cannot
earn more in New South Wales than in England, and that,
consequently, he is not better off there than he would be at
home! I can only say, that I have asserted nothing but what I
actually heard <i>viva voce</i> from several mechanics of repute,
who, assuredly, ought to be the best judges anent this matter.
Moreover, let it be taken for granted, that the artisan earns
exactly what he would be enabled to earn in his native country,
and no more; still I hold, that considering the low price of
provisions in Sydney, and the absence of taxes in the colonies,
he must inevitably be better off in Australia, and most probably
in Van Dieman's Land. That the price of labour is liable to
fluctuate, I have already mentioned; and it must be borne in
mind, that the prices I have stated are those of January of last
year, 1833. By a letter recently arrived from an officer at
Sydney, I find that a discharged soldier of the 4th. Regiment was
earning <i>fourteen shillings</i> <i>per diem</i> as a painter!
Will the author of the above work assert that this man is not
somewhat better off than he would have been in England?</p>
<p>A company has lately been formed for colonizing the country at
Spencer's Gulf; and it is intended that the settlement shall be
independent of the governments of New South Wales, and Swan
River. And a number of emigrants have just proceeded to King
George's sound, which, I hear, is also to constitute an
independent Colony. Convicts are not to be transported to either
of these. By a letter from Swan River, written in July last 1833
I learn, that the produce of grain amounted to between 4000 and
5000 bushels; and that the varieties of fruit and vegetables were
very numerous. The country to a distance of 60 miles to the
Eastward, abounds, we are told, in grass, and the colony is
represented to be in a more flourishing condition than is
generally believed; notwithstanding that the population had
decreased, by departures, from 2,500 to 1,500!</p>
<p>I do not agree with the writer that "<i>all</i> first settlers
must go to the dogs;" for my conviction is, that if there had
been a good harbour at Swan River, the Colony would have
succeeded very much better than it has.</p>

<p>It would be useless to subjoin a list of climbers; they are
well known to be numerous, and many of them are peculiarly
beautiful, as well as ornamental. The emigrant should not fail to
take some with him.</p>
