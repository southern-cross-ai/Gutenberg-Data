  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN the filth of a dark hut, in the village of Obebe the
  cannibal, upon the banks of the Ugogo, Esteban Miranda squatted upon his
  haunches and gnawed upon the remnants of a half-cooked fish. About his neck
  was an iron slave-collar from which a few feet of rusty chain ran to a stout
  post set deep in the ground near the low entranceway that let upon the
  village street not far from the hut of Obebe himself.</p><a id="pic3"
        name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0600651h-images/TarzanAndTheAntMen-03.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">The village of Obebe.</p>
  </div>

  <p>For a year Esteban Miranda had been chained thus, like a dog, and like a
  dog he sometimes crawled through the low doorway of his kennel and basked in
  the sun outside. Two diversions had he; and only two. One was the persistent
  idea that he was Tarzan of the Apes, whom he had impersonated for so long and
  with such growing success that, like the good actor he was, he had come not
  only to act the part, but to live it&mdash;to <i>be</i> it. He <i>was</i>,
  as far as he was concerned, Tarzan of the Apes&mdash;there was no other&mdash;and
  he was Tarzan of the Apes to Obebe, too; but the village witch doctor still
  insisted that he was the river devil and as such, one to propitiate rather
  than to anger.</p>

  <p>It had been this difference of opinion between the chief and the witch
  doctor that had kept Esteban Miranda from the fleshpots of the village, for
  Obebe had wanted to eat him, thinking him his old enemy the ape-man; but the
  witch doctor had aroused the superstitious fears of the villagers by half
  convincing them that their prisoner was the river devil masquerading as
  Tarzan, and, as such, dire disaster would descend upon the village were he
  harmed. The result of this difference between Obebe and the witch doctor had
  been to preserve the life of the Spaniard until the truth of one claim or the
  other was proved&mdash;if Esteban died a natural death he was Tarzan, the
  mortal, and Obebe the chief was vindicated; if he lived on forever, or
  mysteriously disappeared, the claim of the witch doctor would be accepted as
  gospel.</p>

  <p>After he had learned their language and thus come to a realization of the
  accident of fate that had guided his destiny by so narrow a margin from the
  cooking pots of the cannibals he was less eager to proclaim himself Tarzan of
  the Apes. Instead he let drop mysterious suggestions that he was, indeed,
  none other than the river devil. The witch doctor was delighted, and everyone
  was fooled except Obebe, who was old and wise and did not believe in river
  devils, and the witch doctor who was old and wise and did not believe in them
  either, but realized that they were excellent things for his parishioners to
  believe in.</p>

  <p>Esteban Miranda's other diversion, aside from secretly believing himself
  Tarzan, consisted in gloating over the bag of diamonds that Kraski the
  Russian had stolen from the ape-man, and that had fallen into the Spaniard's
  hands after he had murdered Kraski&mdash;the same bag of diamonds that the
  old man had handed to Tarzan in the vaults beneath The Tower of Diamonds, in
  the Valley of The Palace of Diamonds, when he had rescued the Gomangani of
  the valley from the tyrannical oppression of the Bolgani.</p>

  <p>For hours at a time Esteban Miranda sat in the dim light of his dirty
  kennel counting and fondling the brilliant stones. A thousand times had he
  weighed each one in an appraising palm, computing its value and translating
  it into such pleasures of the flesh as great wealth might buy for him in the
  capitals of the world.</p>

  <a id="pic4"
        name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

    <img src="0600651h-images/TarzanAndTheAntMen-04.jpg"

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">For hours at a time Esteban Miranda sat fondling the
    brilliant stones.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Mired in his own filth, feeding upon rotted scraps tossed to him by
  unclean hands, he yet possessed the wealth of a Croesus, and it was as
  Croesus he lived in his imaginings, his dismal hut changed into the pomp and
  circumstance of a palace by the scintillant gleams of the precious stones. At
  the sound of each approaching footstep he would hastily hide his fabulous
  fortune in the wretched loin cloth that was his only garment, and once again
  become a prisoner in a cannibal hut.</p>

  <p>And now, after a year of solitary confinement, came a third diversion, in
  the form of Uhha, the daughter of Khamis the witch doctor. Uhha was fourteen,
  comely and curious. For a year now she had watched the mysterious prisoner
  from a distance until, at last, familiarity had overcome her fears and one
  day she approached him as he lay in the sun outside his hut. Esteban, who had
  been watching her half-timorous advance, smiled encouragingly. He had not a
  friend among the villagers. If he could make but one his lot would be much
  the easier and freedom a step nearer. At last Uhha came to a halt a few steps
  from him. She was a child, ignorant and a savage; but she was a woman-child
  and Esteban Miranda knew women.</p>

  <p>"I have been in the village of the chief Obebe for a year," he said
  haltingly, in the laboriously acquired language of his captors, "but never
  before did I guess that its walls held one so beautiful as you. What is your
  name?"</p>

  <p>Uhha was pleased. She smiled broadly. "I am Uhha," she told him. "My
  father is Khamis the witch doctor."</p>

  <p>It was Esteban who was pleased now. Fate, after rebuffing him for long,
  was at last kind. She had sent him one who, with cultivation, might prove a
  flower of hope indeed.</p>

  <p>"Why have you never come to see me before?" asked Esteban.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid," replied Uhha simply.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I was afraid&mdash;" she hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Afraid that I was the river devil and would harm you?" demanded the
  Spaniard, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" whispered Esteban; "but tell no one. I am the river devil, but I
  shall not harm you."</p>

  <p>"If you are the river devil why then do you remain chained to a stake?"
  inquired Uhha. "Why do you not change yourself to something else and return
  to the river?"</p>

  <p>"You wonder about that, do you?" asked Miranda, sparring for time that he
  might concoct a plausible answer.</p>

  <p>"It is not only Uhha who wonders," said the girl. "Many others have asked
  the same question of late. Obebe asked it first and there was none to
  explain. Obebe says that you are Tarzan, the enemy of Obebe and his people;
  but my father Khamis says that you are the river devil, and that if you
  wanted to get away you would change yourself into a snake and crawl through
  the iron collar that is about your neck. And the people wonder why you do
  not, and many of them are commencing to believe that you are not the river
  devil at all."</p>

  <p>"Come closer, beautiful Uhha," whispered Miranda, "that no other ears than
  yours may hear what I am about to tell you."</p>

  <p>The girl came a little closer and leaned toward him where he squatted upon
  the ground.</p>

  <p>"I am indeed the river devil," said Esteban, "and I come and go as I wish.
  At night, when the village sleeps, I am wandering through the waters of the
  Ugogo, but always I come back again. I am waiting, Uhha, to try the people of
  the village of Obebe that I may know which are my friends and which my
  enemies. Already have I learned that Obebe is no friend of mine, and I am not
  sure of Khamis. Had Khamis been a good friend he would have brought me fine
  food and beer to drink. I could go when I pleased, but I wait to see if there
  be one in the village of Obebe who will set me free, thus may I learn which
  is my best friend. Should there be such a one, Uhha, fortune would smile upon
  him always, his every wish would be granted and he would live to a great age,
  for he would have nothing to fear from the river devil, who would help him in
  all his undertakings. But listen, Uhha, tell no one what I have told you! I
  shall wait a little longer and then if there be no such friend in the village
  of Obebe I shall return to my father and mother, the Ugogo, and destroy the
  people of Obebe. Not one shall remain alive."</p>

  <p>The girl drew away, terrified. It was evident that she was much
  impressed.</p>

  <p>"Do not be afraid," he reassured her. "I shall not harm you."</p>

  <p>"But if you destroy all the people?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Then, of course," he said, "I cannot help you; but let us hope that
  someone comes and sets me free so that I shall know that I have at least one
  good friend here. Now run along, Uhha, and remember that you must tell no one
  what I have told you."</p>

  <p>She moved off a short distance and then returned.</p>

  <p>"When will you destroy the village?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"In a few days," he said.</p>

  <p>Uhha, trembling with terror, ran quickly away in the direction of the hut
  of her father, Khamis, the witch doctor. Esteban Miranda smiled a satisfied
  smile and crawled back into his hole to play with his diamonds.</p><a id=

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">Uhha, trembling with terror, ran quickly away.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Khamis the witch doctor was not in his hut when Uhha his daughter, faint
  from fright, crawled into the dim interior. Nor were his wives. With their
  children, the latter were in the fields beyond the palisade, where Uhha
  should have been. And so it was that the girl had time for thought before she
  saw any of them again, with the result that she recalled distinctly, what she
  had almost forgotten in the first frenzy of fear, that the river devil had
  impressed upon her that she must reveal to no one the thing that he had told
  her.</p>

  <p>And she had been upon the point of telling her father all! What dire
  calamity then would have befallen her? She trembled at the very
  suggestion of a fate so awful that she could not even imagine it. How close a
  call she had had! But what was she to do?</p>

  <p>She lay huddled upon a mat of woven grasses, racking her poor, savage
  little brain for a solution of the immense problem that confronted
  her&mdash;the first problem that had ever entered her young life other than
  the constantly recurring one of how most easily to evade her share of the
  drudgery of the fields. Presently she sat suddenly erect, galvanized into
  statuesque rigidity by a thought engendered by the recollection of one of the
  river devil's remarks. Why had it not occurred to her before? Very plainly he
  had said, and he had repeated it, that if he were released he would know that
  he had at least one friend in the village of Obebe, and that whoever released
  him would live to a great age and have every thing he wished for; but after a
  few minutes of thought Uhha drooped again. How was she, a little girl, to
  compass the liberation of the river devil alone?</p>

  <p>"How, <i>baba</i>," she asked her father, when he had returned to the hut,
  later in the day, "does the river devil destroy those who harm him?"</p>

  <p>"As the fish in the river, so are the ways of the river
  devil&mdash;without number," replied Khamis. "He might send the fish from the
  river and the game from the jungle and cause our crops to die. Then we should
  starve. He might bring the fire out of the sky at night and strike dead all
  the people of Obebe."</p>

  <p>"And you think he may do these things to us, <i>baba</i>?"</p>

  <p>"He will not harm Khamis, who saved him from the death that Obebe would
  have inflicted," replied the witch doctor.</p>

  <p>Uhha recalled that the river devil had complained that Khamis had not
  brought him good food nor beer, but she said nothing about that, although she
  realized that her father was far from being so high in the good graces of the
  river devil as he seemed to think he was. Instead, she took another tack.</p>

  <p>"How can he escape," she asked "while the collar is about his
  neck&mdash;who will remove it for him?"</p>

  <p>"No one can remove it but Obebe, who carries in his pouch the bit of brass
  that makes the collar open," replied Khamis; "but the river devil needs no
  help, for when the time comes that he wishes to be free he has but to become
  a snake and crawl forth from the iron band about his neck. Where are you
  going, Uhha?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to visit the daughter of Obebe," she called back over her
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>The chief's daughter was grinding maize, as Uhha should have been doing.
  She looked up and smiled as the daughter of the witch doctor approached.</p>

  <p>"Make no noise, Uhha," she cautioned, "for Obebe, my father, sleeps
  within." She nodded toward the hut. The visitor sat down and the two girls
  chatted in low tones. They spoke of their ornaments, their coiffures, of the
  young men of the village, and often, when they spoke of these, they giggled.
  Their conversation was not unlike that which might pass between two young
  girls of any race or clime. As they talked, Uhha's eyes often wandered toward
  the entrance to Obebe's hut and many times her brows were contracted in much
  deeper thought than their idle passages warranted.</p>

  <p>"Where," she demanded suddenly, "is the armlet of copper wire that your
  father's brother gave you at the beginning of the last moon?"</p>

  <p>Obebe's daughter shrugged. "He took it back from me," she replied, "and
  gave it to the sister of his youngest wife."</p>

  <p>Uhha appeared crestfallen. Could it be that she had coveted the copper
  bracelet? Her eyes closely scrutinized the person of her friend. Her brows
  almost met, so deeply was she thinking. Suddenly her face brightened.</p>

  <p>"The necklace of many beads that your father took from the body of the
  warrior captured for the last feast!" she exclaimed. "You have not lost
  it?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied her friend. "It is in the house of my father. When I grind
  maize it gets in my way and so I laid it aside."</p>

  <p>"May I see it?" asked Uhha. "I will fetch it."</p>

  <p>"No, you will awaken Obebe and he will be very angry," said the chief's
  daughter.</p>

  <p>"I will not awaken him," replied Uhha, and started to crawl toward the
  hut's entrance.</p>

  <p>Her friend tried to dissuade her. "I will fetch it as soon as <i>baba</i> has
  awakened," she told Uhha, but Uhha paid no attention to her and presently was
  crawling cautiously into the interior of the hut. Once within she waited
  silently until her eyes became accustomed to the dim light. Against the
  opposite wall of the hut Obebe lay sprawled upon a sleeping mat. He snored
  lustily. Uhha crept toward him. Her stealth was the stealth of Sheeta the
  leopard. Her heart was beating like the tom-tom when the dance is at its
  height. She feared that its noise and her rapid breathing would awaken the
  old chief, of whom she was as terrified as of the river devil; but Obebe
  snored on.</p>

  <p>Uhha came close to him. Her eyes were accustomed now to the half-light of
  the hut's interior. At Obebe's side and half beneath his body she saw the
  chief's pouch. Cautiously she reached forth a trembling hand and laid hold
  upon it. She tried to draw it from beneath Obebe's weight. The sleeper
  stirred uneasily and Uhha drew back, terrified. Obebe changed his position
  and Uhha thought that he had awakened. Had she not been frozen with horror
  she would have rushed into headlong flight, but fortunately for her she could
  not move, and presently she heard Obebe resume his interrupted snoring; but
  her nerve was gone and she thought now only of escaping from the hut without
  being detected. She cast a last frightened glance at the chief to reassure
  herself that he still slept. Her eyes fell upon the pouch. Obebe had turned
  away from it and it now lay within her reach, free from the weight of his
  body.</p>

  <p>She reached for it only to withdraw her hand suddenly. She turned away.
  Her heart was in her mouth. She swayed dizzily and then she thought of the
  river devil and of the possibilities for horrid death that lay within his
  power. Once more she reached for the pouch and this time she picked it up.
  Hurriedly opening it she examined the contents. The brass key was there. She
  recognized it because it was the only thing the purpose of which she was not
  familiar with. The collar, chain and key had been taken from an Arab slave
  raider that Obebe had killed and eaten and as some of the old men of Obebe's
  village had worn similar bonds in the past, there was no difficulty in
  adapting it to its intended purpose when occasion demanded.</p>

  <p>Uhha hastily closed the pouch and replaced it at Obebe's side. Then,
  clutching the key in a clammy palm, she crawled hurriedly toward the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>That night, after the cooking fires had died to embers and been covered
  with earth and the people of Obebe had withdrawn into their huts, Esteban
  Miranda heard a stealthy movement at the entrance to his kennel. He listened
  intently. Someone was creeping into the interior&mdash;someone or
  something.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" demanded the Spaniard in a voice that he tried hard to keep
  from trembling.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" responded the intruder in soft tones. "It is I, Uhha, the daughter
  of Khamis the witch doctor. I have come to set you free that you may know
  that you have a good friend in the village of Obebe and will, therefore, not
  destroy us."</p>

  <p>Miranda smiled. His suggestion had borne fruit more quickly than he had
  dared to hope, and evidently the girl had obeyed his injunction to keep
  silent. In that matter he had reasoned wrongly, but of what moment that,
  since his sole aim in life&mdash;freedom&mdash;was to be accomplished. He had
  cautioned the girl to silence believing this the surest way to disseminate
  the word he had wished spread through the village, where, he was positive, it
  would have come to the ears of some one of the superstitious savages with the
  means to free him now that the incentive was furnished.</p>

  <p>"And how are you going to free me?" demanded Miranda.</p>

  <p>"See!" exclaimed Uhha. "I have brought the key to the collar about your
  neck."</p>

  <p>"Good," cried the Spaniard. "Where is it?"</p>

  <p>Uhha crawled closer to the man and handed him the key. Then she would have
  fled.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" demanded the prisoner. "When I am free you must lead me forth into
  the jungle. Whoever sets me free must do this if he would win the favor of
  the river god."</p>

  <p>Uhha was afraid, but she did not dare refuse. Miranda fumbled with the
  ancient lock for several minutes before it at last gave to the worn key the
  girl had brought. Then he snapped the padlock again and carrying the key with
  him crawled toward the entrance.</p>

  <p>"Get me weapons," he whispered to the girl and Uhha departed through the
  shadows of the village street. Miranda knew that she was terrified but was
  confident that this very terror would prove the means of bringing her back to
  him with the weapons. Nor was he wrong, for scarce five minutes had elapsed
  before Uhha had returned with a quiver of arrows, a bow and a stout
  knife.</p>

  <p>"Now lead me to the gate," commanded Esteban.</p>

  <p>Keeping out of the main street and as much in rear of the huts as possible
  Uhha led the fugitive toward the village gates. It surprised her a little
  that he, a river devil, should not know how to unlock and open them, for she
  had thought that river devils were all-wise; but she did as he bid and showed
  him how the great bar could be withdrawn, and helped him push the gates open
  enough to permit him to pass through. Beyond was the clearing that led to the
  river, on either hand rose the giants of the jungle. It was very dark out
  there and Esteban Miranda suddenly discovered that his new-found liberty had
  its drawbacks. To go forth alone at night into the dark, mysterious jungle
  filled him with a nameless dread.</p>

  <p>Uhha drew back from the gates. She had done her part and saved the village
  from destruction. Now she wished to close the gates again and hasten back to
  the hut of her father, there to lie trembling in nervous excitement and
  terror against the morning that would reveal to the village the escape of the
  river devil.</p>

  <p>Esteban reached forth and took her by the arm. "Come," he said, "and
  receive your reward."</p>

  <p>Uhha shrank away from him. "Let me go!" she cried. "I am afraid."</p>

  <p>But Esteban was afraid, too, and he had decided that the company of this
  little Negro girl would be better than no company at all in the depths of the
  lonely jungle. Possibly when daylight came he would let her go back to her
  people, but tonight he shuddered at the thought of entering the jungle
  without human companionship.</p>

  <p>Uhha tried to tear herself free from his grasp. She struggled like a
  little lion cub, and at last would have raised her voice in a wild scream for
  help had not Miranda suddenly clapped his palm across her mouth, lifted her
  bodily from the ground and running swiftly across the clearing disappeared
  into the jungle.</p><a id="pic6"

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THREE persons stepped from the veranda of Lord Greystoke's
  African bungalow and walked slowly toward the gate along a rose-embowered
  path that swung in a graceful curve through the well-ordered, though
  unpretentious, grounds surrounding the ape-man's rambling, one-story home.
  There were two men and a woman, all in khaki, the older man carrying a
  flier's helmet and a pair of goggles in one hand. He was smiling quietly as
  he listened to the younger man.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't be doing this now if mother were here," said the latter,
  "she would never permit it."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you are right, my son," replied Tarzan; "but only this one
  flight alone and then I'll promise not to go up again until she returns. You
  have said yourself that I am an apt pupil and if you are any sort of an
  instructor you should have perfect confidence in me after having said that I
  was perfectly competent to pilot a ship alone. Eh, Meriem, isn't that true?"
  he demanded of the young woman.</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "Like My Dear, I am always afraid for you, <i>mon père</i>,"
  she replied. "You take such risks that one would think you considered
  yourself immortal. You should be more careful."</p>

  <p>The younger man threw his arm about his wife's shoulders. "Meriem is
  right," he said, "you <i>should</i> be more careful, Father."</p>

  <p>Tarzan shrugged. "If you and mother had your way my nerves and muscles
  would have atrophied long since. They were given me to use and I intend using
  them&mdash;with discretion. Doubtless I shall be old and useless soon enough,
  and long enough, as it is."</p>

  <p>A child burst suddenly from the bungalow, pursued by a perspiring
  governess, and raced to Meriem's side.</p>

  <p>"Muwer," he cried, "Dackie doe? Dackie doe?"</p>

  <p>"Let him come along," urged Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"Dare!" exclaimed the boy, turning triumphantly upon the governess;
  "Dackie do doe yalk!"</p>

  <p>Out on the level plain, that stretched away from the bungalow to the
  distant jungle the verdant masses and deep shadows of which were vaguely
  discernible to the northwest, lay a biplane, in the shade of which lolled two
  Waziri warriors who had been trained by Korak, the son of Tarzan, in the
  duties of mechanicians, and, later, to pilot the ship themselves; a fact that
  had not been without weight in determining Tarzan of the Apes to perfect
  himself in the art of flying, since, as chief of the Waziri, it was not meet
  that the lesser warriors of his tribe should excel him in any particular.
  Adjusting his helmet and goggles Tarzan climbed into the cockpit.</p><a id=

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">Before Lord Greystoke's bungalow lay a biplane.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"Better take me along," advised Korak.</p>

  <p>Tarzan shook his head, smiling good-naturedly.</p>

  <p>"Then one of the boys, here," urged his son. "You might develop some
  trouble that would force you to make a landing and if you have no mechanician
  along to make repairs what are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"Walk," replied the ape-man. "Turn her over, Andua!" he directed one of
  the blacks.</p>

  <p>A moment later the ship was bumping over the veldt, from which, directly,
  it rose in smooth and graceful flight, circled, climbing to a greater
  altitude, and then sped away in an air line, while on the ground below the
  six strained their eyes until the wavering speck that it had dwindled to
  disappeared entirely from their view.</p>

  <p>"Where do you suppose he is going?" asked Meriem.</p>

  <p>Korak shook his head. "He isn't supposed to be going anywhere in
  particular," he replied, "just making his first practice flight alone; but,
  knowing him as I do, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that he had taken it
  into his head to fly to London and see mother."</p>

  <p>"But he could never do it!" cried Meriem.</p>

  <p>"No ordinary man could, with no more experience than he has had; but then,
  you will have to admit, father is no ordinary man."</p>

  <p>For an hour and a half Tarzan flew without altering his course and without
  realizing the flight of time or the great distance he had covered, so
  delighted was he with the ease with which he controlled the ship, and so
  thrilled by this new power that gave him the freedom and mobility of the
  birds, the only denizens of his beloved jungle that he ever had had cause to
  envy.</p>

  <p>Presently, ahead, he discerned a great basin, or what might better be
  described as a series of basins, surrounded by wooded hills, and immediately
  he recognized to the left of it the winding Ugogo; but the country of the
  basins was new to him and he was puzzled. He recognized, simultaneously,
  another fact; that he was over a hundred miles from home, and he determined
  to put back at once; but the mystery of the basins lured him on&mdash;he
  could not bring himself to return home without a closer view of them. Why was
  it that he had never come upon this country in his many wanderings? Why had
  he never even heard of it from the natives living within easy access to it.
  He dropped to a lower level the better to inspect the basins, which now
  appeared to him as a series of shallow craters of long extinct
  volcanoes.</p><a id="pic8"
        name="pic8"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0600651h-images/TarzanAndTheAntMen-08.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">He dropped to a lower level the better to inspect the
    basins.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>He saw forests, lakes and rivers, the very existence of which he had never
  dreamed, and then quite suddenly he discovered a solution of the seeming
  mystery that there should exist in a country with which he was familiar so
  large an area of which he had been in total ignorance, in common with the
  natives of the country surrounding it. He recognized it now&mdash;the
  so-called Great Thorn Forest. For years he had been familiar with that
  impenetrable thicket that was supposed to cover a vast area of territory into
  which only the smallest of animals might venture, and now he saw it was but a
  relatively narrow fringe encircling a pleasant, habitable country, but a
  fringe so cruelly barbed as to have forever protected the secret that it held
  from the eyes of man.</p>

  <p>Tarzan determined to circle the long hidden land of mystery before setting
  the nose of his ship toward home, and, to obtain a closer view, he
  accordingly dropped nearer the earth. Beneath him was a great forest and
  beyond that an open veldt that ended at the foot of precipitous, rocky hills.
  He saw that absorbed as he had been in the strange, new country he had
  permitted the plane to drop too low. Coincident with the realization and
  before he could move the control within his hand, the ship touched the leafy
  crown of some old monarch of the jungle, veered, swung completely around and
  crashed downward through the foliage amidst the snapping and rending of
  broken branches and the splintering of its own woodwork. Just for a second
  this noise, and then silence.</p>

  <p><br>
  ALONG a forest trail slouched a mighty creature, manlike in its physical
  attributes, yet vaguely inhuman; a great brute that walked erect upon two
  feet and carried a club in one horny, calloused hand. Its long hair fell,
  unkempt, about its shoulders, and there was hair upon its chest and a little
  upon its arms and legs, though no more than is found upon many males of
  civilized races. A strip of hide about its waist supported the ends of a
  narrow G-string as well as numerous rawhide strands to the lower ends of
  which were fastened round stones from one to two inches in diameter. Close to
  each stone were attached several small feathers, for the most part of
  brilliant hues. The strands supporting the stones being fastened to the belt
  at intervals of one to two inches and the strands themselves being about
  eighteen inches long the whole formed a skeleton skirt, fringed with round
  stones and feathers, that fell almost to the creature's knees. Its large feet
  were bare and its white skin tanned to a light brown by exposure to the
  elements. The illusion of great size was suggested more by the massiveness of
  the shoulders and the development of the muscles of the back and arms than by
  height, though the creature measured close to six feet. Its face was massive,
  with a broad nose, and a wide, full-lipped mouth; the eyes, of normal size,
  were set beneath heavy, beetling brows, topped by a wide, low forehead. As it
  walked it flapped its large, flat ears and occasionally moved rapidly
  portions of its skin on various parts of its head and body to dislodge flies,
  as you have seen a horse do with the muscles along its sides and flanks.</p>

  <p>It moved silently, its dark eyes constantly on the alert, while the
  flapping ears were often momentarily stilled as the woman listened for sounds
  of quarry or foe.</p>

  <p>She stopped now, her ears bent forward, her nostrils, expanded, sniffing
  the air. Some scent or sound that our dead sensitory organs could not have
  perceived had attracted her attention. Warily she crept forward along the
  trail until, at a turning, she saw before her a figure lying face downward in
  the path. It was Tarzan of the Apes. Unconscious he lay while above him the
  splintered wreckage of his plane was wedged among the branches of the great
  tree that had caused its downfall.</p>

  <p>The woman gripped her club more firmly and approached. Her expression
  reflected the puzzlement the discovery of this strange creature had
  engendered in her elementary mind, but she evinced no fear. She walked
  directly to the side of the prostrate man, her club raised to strike; but
  something stayed her hand. She knelt beside him and fell to examining his
  clothing. She turned him over on his back and placed one of her ears above
  his heart. Then, she fumbled with the front of his shirt for a moment and
  suddenly taking it in her two mighty hands tore it apart. Again she listened,
  her ear this time against his naked flesh. She arose and looked about,
  sniffing and listening, then she stooped and lifting the body of the ape-man
  she swung it lightly across one of her broad shoulders and continued along
  the trail in the direction she had been going. The trail, winding through the
  forest, broke presently from the leafy shade into an open, parklike strip of
  rolling land that stretched at the foot of rocky hills, and, crossing this,
  disappeared within the entrance of a narrow gorge, eroded by the elements
  from the native sandstone fancifully as the capricious architecture of a
  dream, among whose grotesque domes and miniature rocks the woman bore her
  burden.</p>

  <p>A half mile from the entrance to the gorge the trail entered a roughly
  circular amphitheater, the precipitous walls of which were pierced by
  numerous cave-mouths before several of which squatted creatures similar to
  that which bore Tarzan into this strange, savage environment.</p>

  <p>As she entered the amphitheater all eyes were upon her, for their large,
  sensitive ears had warned them of her approach long before she had arrived
  within scope of their vision. Immediately they beheld her and her burden
  several of them arose and came to meet her. All females, these, similar in
  physique and scant garb to the captor of the ape-man, though differing in
  proportions and physiognomy as do the individuals of all races differ from
  their fellows. They spoke no words nor uttered any sounds, nor did she whom
  they approached, as she moved straight along her way which was evidently
  directed toward one of the cave-mouths, but she gripped her bludgeon firmly
  and swung it to and fro, while her eyes, beneath their scowling brows, kept
  sullen surveillance upon the every move of her fellows.</p>

  <p>She had approached close to the cave, which was quite evidently her
  destination, when one of those who followed her darted suddenly forward and
  clutched at Tarzan. With the quickness of a cat the woman dropped her burden,
  turned upon the temerarious one, and swinging her bludgeon with
  lightning-like celerity felled her with a heavy blow to the head, and then,
  standing astride the prostrate Tarzan, she glared about her like a lioness at
  bay, questioning dumbly who would be next to attempt to wrest her prize from
  her; but the others slunk back to their caves, leaving the vanquished one
  lying, unconscious, in the hot sand and the victor to shoulder her burden,
  undisputed, and continue her way to her cave, where she dumped the ape-man
  unceremoniously upon the ground just within the shadow of the entranceway,
  and, squatting beside him, facing outward that she might not be taken unaware
  by any of her fellows, she proceeded to examine her find minutely. Tarzan's
  clothing either piqued her curiosity or aroused her disgust, for she began
  almost immediately to divest him of it, and having had no former experience
  of buttons and buckles, she tore it away by main force. The heavy, cordovan
  boots troubled her for a moment, but finally their seams gave way to her
  powerful muscles.</p>

  <p>Only the diamond-studded, golden locket that had been his mother's she
  left untouched upon its golden chain about his neck.</p>

  <p>For a moment she sat contemplating him and then she arose and tossing him
  once more to her shoulder she walked toward the center of the amphitheater,
  the greater portion of which was covered by low buildings constructed of
  enormous slabs of stone, some set on edge to form the walls while others,
  lying across these, constituted the roofs. Joined end to end, with occasional
  wings at irregular intervals running out into the amphitheater, they enclosed
  a rough oval of open ground that formed a large courtyard.</p>

  <p>The several outer entrances to the buildings were closed with two slabs of
  stone, one of which, standing on edge, covered the aperture, while the other,
  leaning against the first upon the outside, held it securely in place against
  any efforts that might be made to dislodge it from the interior of the
  building.</p>

  <p>To one of these entrances the woman carried her unconscious captive, laid
  him on the ground, removed the slabs that closed the aperture and dragged him
  into the dim and gloomy interior, where she deposited him upon the floor and
  clapped her palms together sharply three times with the result that there
  presently slouched into the room six or seven children of both sexes, who
  ranged in age from one year to sixteen or seventeen. The very youngest of
  them walked easily and seemed as fit to care for itself as the young of most
  lower orders at a similar age. The girls, even the youngest, were armed with
  clubs, but the boys carried no weapons either of offense or defense. At sight
  of them the woman pointed to Tarzan, struck her head with her clenched fist
  and then gestured toward herself, touching her breast several times with a
  calloused thumb. She made several other motions with her hands, so eloquent
  of meaning that one entirely unfamiliar with her sign language could almost
  guess their purport, then she turned and left the building, replaced the
  stones before the entrance, and slouched back to her cave, passing,
  apparently without notice, the woman she had recently struck down and who was
  now rapidly regaining consciousness.</p>

  <p>As she took her seat before her cave-mouth her victim suddenly sat erect,
  rubbed her head for a moment and then, after looking about dully, rose
  unsteadily to her feet. For just an instant she swayed and staggered, but
  presently she mastered herself, and with only a glance at the author of her
  hurt moved off in the direction of her own cave. Before she had reached it
  her attention, together with that of all the others of this strange
  community, or at least of all those who were in the open, was attracted by
  the sound of approaching footsteps. She halted in her tracks, her great ears
  up-pricked, listening, her eyes directed toward the trail leading up from the
  valley. The others were similarly watching and listening and a moment later
  their vigil was rewarded by sight of another of their kind as she appeared in
  the entrance of the amphitheater. A huge creature this, even larger than she
  who captured the ape-man, broader and heavier, though little, if any,
  taller&mdash;carrying upon one shoulder the carcass of an antelope and upon
  the other the body of a creature that might have been half-human and
  half-beast, yet, assuredly, not entirely either the one or the other.</p>

  <p>The antelope was dead, but not so the other creature. It wriggled
  weakly&mdash;its futile movements could not have been termed
  struggles&mdash;as it hung, its middle across the bare brown shoulder of its
  captor, its arms and legs dangling limply before and behind, either in
  partial unconsciousness or in the paralysis of fear.</p>

  <p>The woman who had brought Tarzan to the amphitheater rose and stood before
  the entrance of her cave. We shall have to call her The First Woman, for she
  had no name; in the muddy convolutions of her sluggish brain she never had
  sensed even the need for a distinctive specific appellation and among her
  fellows she was equally nameless, as were they, and so, that we may
  differentiate her from the others, we shall call her The First Woman, and,
  similarly, we shall know the creature that she felled with her bludgeon as
  The Second Woman, and she who now entered the amphitheater with a burden upon
  each shoulder, as The Third Woman. So The First Woman rose, her eyes fixed
  upon the newcomer, her ears up-pricked. And The Second Woman rose, and all
  the others that were in sight, and all stood glaring at The Third Woman who
  moved steadily along with her burden, her watchful eyes ever upon the
  menacing figures of her fellows. She was very large, this Third Woman, so for
  a while the others only stood and glared at her, but presently The First
  Woman took a step forward and turning, cast a long look at The Second Woman,
  and then she took another step forward and stopped and looked again at The
  Second Woman, and this time she pointed at herself, at The Second Woman and
  then at The Third Woman who now quickened her pace in the direction of her
  cave, for she understood the menace in the attitude of The First Woman. The
  Second Woman understood, too, and moved forward now with The First Woman. No
  word was spoken, no sound issued from those savage lips; lips that never had
  parted to a smile; lips that never had known laughter, nor ever would.</p>

  <p>As the two approached her The Third Woman dropped her spoils in a heap at
  her feet, gripped her cudgel more firmly and prepared to defend her rights.
  The others, brandishing their own weapons, charged her. The remaining women
  were now but onlookers, their hands stayed, perhaps, by some ancient tribal
  custom that gauged the number of attackers by the quantity of spoil, awarding
  the right of contest to whoever initiated it. When The First Woman had been
  attacked by The Second Woman the others had all held aloof, for it had been
  The Second Woman that had advanced first to try conclusively for the
  possession of Tarzan. And now The Third Woman had come with two prizes, and
  since The First Woman and The Second Woman had stepped out to meet her the
  others had held back.</p>

  <p>As the three women came together it seemed inevitable that The Third Woman
  would go down beneath the bludgeons of the others, but she warded both blows
  with the skill and celerity of a trained fencer and stepping quickly into the
  opening she had dealt The First Woman a terrific blow upon the head that
  stretched her motionless upon the ground, where a little pool of blood and
  brains attested the terrible strength of the wielder of the bludgeon the
  while it marked the savage, unmourned passing of The First Woman.</p>

  <p>And now The Third Woman could devote her undivided attention to The Second
  Woman, but The Second Woman seeing the fate of her companion did not wait to
  discuss the matter further, and instead of remaining to continue the fight
  she broke and ran for the cave, while the creature that The Third Woman had
  been carrying along with the carcass of the antelope apparently believing
  that it saw a chance for escape while its captor was engaged with her
  assailants was crawling stealthily away in the opposite direction. Its
  attempt might have proved successful had the fight lasted longer; but the
  skill and ferocity of The Third Woman had terminated the whole thing in a
  matter of seconds, and now, turning about, she espied a portion of her prey
  seeking to escape and sprang quickly after it. As she did so The Second Woman
  wheeled and darted back to seize the carcass of the antelope, while the
  crawling fugitive leaped to its feet and raced swiftly down the trail that
  led through the mouth of the amphitheater toward the valley.</p>

  <p>As the thing rose to its feet it became apparent that it was a man, or at
  least a male, and evidently of the same species as the women of this peculiar
  race, though much shorter and of proportionately lighter build. It stood
  about five feet in height, had a few hairs on its upper lip and chin, a much
  lower forehead than the women, and its eyes were set closer together. Its
  legs were much longer and more slender than those of the women, who seemed to
  have been designed for strength rather than speed, and the result was that it
  was apparent from the start that The Third Woman could have no hope of
  overhauling her escaping quarry, and then it was that the utility of the
  strange skirt of thongs and pebbles and feathers became apparent. Seizing one
  of the thongs she disengaged it easily and quickly from the girdle that
  supported them about her hips, and grasping the end of the thong between a
  thumb and forefinger she whirled it rapidly in a vertical plane until the
  feathered pebble at its end was moving with great rapidity&mdash;then she let
  go the thong. Like an arrow the missile sped toward the racing fugitive, the
  pebble, a fairly good-sized one as large as an English walnut, struck the man
  upon the back of his head dropping him, unconscious, to the ground. Then the
  Third Woman turned upon The Second Woman who, by this time, had seized the
  antelope, and brandishing her bludgeon bore down upon her. The Second Woman,
  possessing more courage than good sense, prepared to defend her stolen flesh
  and took her stand, her bludgeon ready. As The Third Woman bore down upon
  her, a veritable mountain of muscle, The Second Woman met her with
  threatening cudgel, but so terrific was the blow dealt by her mighty
  adversary that her weapon, splintered, was swept from her hands and she found
  herself at the mercy of the creature she would have robbed. Evidently she
  knew how much of mercy she might expect. She did not fall upon her knees in
  an attitude of supplication&mdash;not she. Instead she tore a handful of the
  pebble-missiles from her girdle in a vain attempt to defend herself. Futilest
  of futilities! The huge, destroying bludgeon had not even paused, but
  swinging in a great circle fell crushingly upon the skull of The Second
  Woman.</p>

  <p>The Third Woman paused and looked about questioningly as if to ask: "Is
  there another who wishes to take from me my antelope or my man? If so, let
  her step forward." But no one accepted the gage and presently the woman
  turned and walked back to the prostrate man. Roughly she jerked him to his
  feet and shook him. Consciousness was returning slowly and he tried to stand.
  His efforts, however, were a failure and so she threw him across her shoulder
  again and walked back to the dead antelope, which she flung to the opposite
  shoulder and, continuing her interrupted way to her cave, dumped the two
  unceremoniously to the ground. Here, in the cave-mouth, she kindled a fire,
  twirling a fire stick dexterously amidst dry tinder in a bit of hollowed
  wood, and cutting generous strips from the carcass of the antelope ate
  ravenously. While she was thus occupied the man regained consciousness and
  sitting up looked about, dazed. Presently his nostrils caught the aroma of
  the cooking meat and he pointed at it. The woman handed him the rude stone
  knife that she had tossed back to the floor of the cave and motioned toward
  the meat. The man seized the implement and was soon broiling a generous cut
  above the fire. Half-burned and half-raw as it was he ate it with seeming
  relish, and as he ate the woman sat and watched him. He was not much to look
  at, yet she may have thought him handsome. Unlike the women, who wore no
  ornaments, the man had bracelets and anklets as well as a necklace of teeth
  and pebbles, while in his hair, which was wound into a small knot above his
  forehead, were thrust several wooden skewers ten or twelve inches long, which
  protruded in various directions in a horizontal plane.</p>

  <p>When the man had eaten his fill the woman rose and seizing him by the hair
  dragged him into the cave. He scratched and bit at her, trying to escape, but
  he was no match for his captor.</p>

  <p>Upon the floor of the amphitheater, before the entrances to the caves, lay
  the bodies of The First Woman and The Second Woman and black upon them
  swarmed the circling scavengers of the sky. Ska, the vulture, was first
  always to the feast.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WITHIN the dim interior of the strange rocky chamber where
  he had been so ruthlessly deposited, Tarzan immediately became the center of
  interest to the several Alali young that crowded about him. They examined him
  carefully, turned him over, pawed him, pinched him, and at last one of the
  young males, attracted by the golden locket removed it from the ape-man's
  neck and placed it about his own. Lowest, perhaps, in the order of human
  evolution nothing held their interest overlong, with the result that they
  soon tired of Tarzan and trooped out into the sunlit courtyard, leaving the
  ape-man to regain consciousness as best he could, or not at all. It was
  immaterial to them which he did. Fortunately for the Lord of the Jungle the
  fall through the roof of the forest had been broken by the fortuitous
  occurrence of supple branches directly in the path of his descent, with the
  happy result that he suffered only from a slight concussion of the brain.
  Already he was slowly regaining consciousness, and not long after the Alali
  young had left him his eyes opened, rolled dully inspecting the dim interior
  of his prison, and closed again. His breathing was normal and when again he
  opened his eyes it was as though he had emerged from a deep and natural
  slumber, the only reminder of his accident being a dull aching of the head.</p>

  <p>Sitting up, he looked about him, his eyes gradually accustoming themselves to
  the dim light of the chamber. He found himself in a rude shelter constructed
  of great slabs of rock. A single opening led into what appeared to be another
  similar chamber the interior of which, however, was much lighter than that in
  which he lay. Slowly he rose to his feet and crossed to the opening. Across
  the second chamber he beheld another doorway leading into the fresh air and
  the sunshine. Except for filthy heaps of dead grasses on the floor both the
  rooms were unfurnished and devoid of any suggestion that they were utilized
  as places of human habitation. From the second doorway, to which he crossed,
  he looked out upon a narrow courtyard walled by great slabs of stone, the
  lower ends of which, embedded in the ground, caused them to remain erect.
  Here he saw the young Alali squatting about, some in the sun, others in the
  shadow. Tarzan looked at them in evident puzzlement. What were they? What was
  this place in which he was, all too evidently, incarcerated? Were these his
  keepers or were they his fellow prisoners? How had he come hither?</p>

  <p>Running his fingers through his shock of black hair in a characteristic
  gesture of perplexity, he shook his head. He recalled the unfortunate
  termination of the flight; he even remembered falling through the foliage of
  the great tree; but beyond that all was blank. He stood for a moment
  examining the Alali, who were all unconscious of his near presence or his
  gaze upon them, and then he stepped boldly out into the courtyard before
  them, as a lion, fearless, ignores the presence of jackals.</p>

  <p>Immediately they saw him, they rose and clustered about him, the girls
  pushing the boys aside and coming boldly close, and Tarzan spoke to them,
  first in one native dialect and then in another, but they seemed not to
  understand, for they made no reply, and then, as a last resort, he addressed
  them in the primitive language of the great apes, the language of Manu the
  monkey, the first language that Tarzan had learned when, as a babe, he
  suckled at the hairy breast of Kala, the she-ape, and listened to the
  gutturals of the savage members of the tribe of Kerchak; but again his
  auditors made no response&mdash;at least no audible response, though they
  moved their hands and shoulders and bodies, and jerked their heads in what
  the ape-man soon recognized as a species of sign language, nor did they utter
  any vocal sounds that might indicate that they were communicating with one
  another through the medium of a spoken language. Presently they again lost
  interest in the newcomer and resumed their indolent lounging about the walls
  of the courtyard while Tarzan paced to and fro its length, his keen eye
  searching for whatever avenue of escape chance might provide, and he saw it
  in the height of the walls, to the top of which a long, running jump would
  take his outstretched fingers, he was sure; but not yet&mdash;he must wait
  for darkness to shield his attempt from those within the enclosure and those
  without. And as darkness approached the actions of the other occupants of the
  courtyard became noticeably altered; they walked back and forth, constantly
  passing and re-passing the entrance to the shelter at the end of the
  courtyard, and occasionally entering the first room and often passing to the
  second room where they listened for a moment before the great slab that
  closed the outer aperture, then back into the courtyard again and back and
  forth in restless movement. Finally one stamped a foot upon the ground and
  this was taken up by the others until, in regular cadence the thud, thud,
  thud of their naked feet must have been audible for some distance beyond the
  confines of their narrow prison yard.</p>

  <p>Whatever this procedure might have been intended to accomplish, nothing,
  apparently, resulted, and presently one of the girls, her sullen face
  snarling in anger, seized her bludgeon more firmly in her two hands and
  stepping close to one of the walls began pounding violently upon one of its
  huge stone slabs. Instantly the other girls followed her example, while the
  young males continued beating time with their heels.</p>

  <p>For a while Tarzan was puzzled for an explanation of their behavior, but
  it was his own stomach that at last suggested an answer&mdash;the creatures
  were hungry and were attempting to attract the attention of their jailers;
  and their method of doing so suggested something else, as well, something of
  which his past brief experience with them had already partially convinced
  him&mdash;the creatures were without speech, even totally unvocal,
  perhaps.</p>

  <p>The girl who had started the pounding upon the wall suddenly stopped and
  pointed at Tarzan. The others looked at him and then back at her, whereupon
  she pointed at her bludgeon and then at Tarzan again, after which she acted
  out a little pantomime, very quickly, very briefly, but none the less
  realistically. The pantomime depicted the bludgeon falling upon Tarzan's
  head, following which the pantomimist, assisted by her fellows, devoured the
  ape-man. The bludgeons ceased to fall upon the wall; the heels no longer
  smote the earth; the assemblage was interested in the new suggestion. They
  eyed Tarzan hungrily. The mother who should have brought them food, The First
  Woman, was dead. They did not know this; all they knew was that they were
  hungry and that The First Woman had brought them no food since the day
  before. They were not cannibals. Only in the last stages of hunger, would
  they have devoured one another, even as shipwrecked sailors of civilized
  races have been known to do; but they did not look upon the stranger as one
  of their own kind. He was as unlike them as some of the other creatures that
  The First Woman had brought them to feed upon. It was no more wrong to devour
  him than it would have been to devour an antelope. The thought, however,
  would not have occurred to most of them; the older girl it was who had
  suggested it to them, nor would it have occurred to her had there been other
  food, for she knew that he had not been brought here for that
  purpose&mdash;he had been brought as the mate of The First Woman, who in
  common with the other women of this primitive race hunted a new mate each
  season among the forests and the jungles where the timid males lived their
  solitary lives except for the brief weeks that they were held captive in the
  stone corrals of the dominant sex, and where they were treated with great
  brutality and contempt even by the children of their temporary spouses.</p>

  <p>Sometimes they managed to escape, though rarely, but eventually they were
  turned loose, since it was easier to hunt a new one the following season than
  to feed one in captivity for a whole year. There was nothing approximating
  love in the family relations of these savage half-brutes. The young,
  conceived without love, knowing not their own fathers, possessed not even an
  elemental affection for one another, nor for any other living thing. A
  certain tie bound them to their savage mothers, at whose breasts they suckled
  for a few short months and to whom they looked for food until they were
  sufficiently developed to go forth into the forests and make their own kills
  or secure whatever other food bountiful Nature provided for them.</p>

  <p>Somewhere between the ages of fifteen and seventeen the young males were
  liberated and chased into the forest, after which their mothers knew them not
  from any other male and at a similar age the females were taken to the
  maternal cave, where they lived, accompanying their mothers on the daily
  hunt, until they had succeeded in capturing a first mate. After that they
  took up their abodes in separate caves and the tie between parent and child
  was cut as cleanly as though it never had existed, and they might, the
  following season, even become rivals for the same man, or at any time quarrel
  to the death over the spoils of the chase.</p>

  <p>The building of the stone shelters and corrals in which the children and
  the males were kept was the only community activity in which the women
  engaged and this work they were compelled to do alone, since the men would
  have escaped into the forest at the first opportunity had they been released
  from the corrals to take part in the work of construction, while the children
  as soon as they had become strong enough to be of any assistance would
  doubtless have done likewise; but the great shes were able to accomplish
  their titanic labors alone.</p>

  <p>Equipped by nature with mighty frames and thews of steel they quarried the
  great slabs from a side hill overlooking the amphitheater, slid them to the
  floor of the little valley and pulled and pushed them into position by main
  strength and awkwardness, as the homely saying of our forefathers has it.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for them it was seldom necessary to add to the shelters and
  corrals already built since the high rate of mortality among the females
  ordinarily left plenty of vacant enclosures for maturing girls. Jealousy,
  greed, the hazards of the hunt, the contingencies of intertribal wars all
  took heavy toll among the adult shes. Even the despised male, fighting for
  his freedom, sometimes slew his captor.</p>

  <p>The hideous life of the Alalus was the natural result of the unnatural
  reversal of sex dominance. It is the province of the male to initiate love
  and by his masterfulness to inspire first respect, then admiration in the
  breast of the female he seeks to attract. Love itself developed after these
  other emotions. The gradually increasing ascendency of the female Alalus over
  the male eventually prevented the emotions of respect and admiration for the
  male from being aroused, with the result that love never followed.</p>

  <p>Having no love for her mate and having become a more powerful brute, the
  savage Alalus woman soon came to treat the members of the opposite sex with
  contempt and brutality with the result that the power, or at least the
  desire, to initiate love ceased to exist in the heart of the male&mdash;he
  could not love a creature he feared and hated, he could not respect or admire
  the unsexed creatures that the Alali women had become, and so he fled into
  the forests and the jungles and there the dominant females hunted him lest
  their race perish from the earth.</p>

  <p>It was the offspring of such savage and perverted creatures that Tarzan
  faced, fully aware of their cannibalistic intentions. The males did not
  attack him at once, but busily engaged themselves in fetching dry grass and
  small pieces of wood from one of the covered chambers, and while the three
  girls, one of them scarce seven years of age, approached the ape-man warily
  with ready bludgeons, they prepared a fire over which they expected soon to
  be broiling juicy cuts from the strange creature that their hairy dam had
  brought them.</p><a id="pic9"

    <p class="caption">The three girls approached the ape-man warily with ready
    bludgeons.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>One of the males, a lad of sixteen, held back, making excited signs with
  hands, head and body. He appeared to be trying to dissuade or prevent the
  girls from the carrying-out of their plan, he even appealed to the other boys
  for backing, but they merely glanced at the girls and continued their
  culinary preparations. At last however, as the girls were deliberately
  approaching the ape-man he placed himself directly in their path and
  attempted to stop them. Instantly the three little demons swung their
  bludgeons and sprang forward to destroy him. The boy dodged, plucked several
  of the feathered stones from his girdle and flung them at his assailants. So
  swift and so accurate did the missiles speed that two girls dropped, howling,
  to the ground. The third missed, striking one of the other boys on the
  temple, killing him instantly. He was the youth who had stolen Tarzan's
  locket, which, being like all his fellow males a timid creature, he had kept
  continually covered by a palm since the ape-man's return to consciousness had
  brought him out into the courtyard among them.</p>

  <p>The older girl, nothing daunted, leaped forward, her face hideous in a
  snarl of rage. The boy cast another stone at her and then turned and ran
  toward the ape-man. What reception he expected he himself probably did not
  know. Perhaps it was the recrudescence of a long dead emotion of fellowship
  that prompted him to place himself at Tarzan's side&mdash;possibly Tarzan
  himself in whom loyalty to kind was strong had inspired this reawakening of
  an atrophied soul-sense. However that may be the fact remains that the boy
  came and stood at Tarzan's side while the girl, evidently sensing danger to
  herself in this strange, new temerity of her brother, advanced more
  cautiously.</p>

  <p>In signs she seemed to be telling him what she would do to him if he did
  not cease to interpose his weak will between her and her gastronomic desires;
  but he signed back at her defiantly and stood his ground. Tarzan reached over
  and patted him on the back, smiling. The boy bared his teeth horribly, but it
  seemed evident that he was trying to return the ape-man's smile. And now the
  girl was almost upon them. Tarzan was quite at a loss as to how to proceed
  against her. His natural chivalry restrained him from attacking her and made
  it seem most repellent to injure her even in self-preservation; but he knew
  that before he was done with her he might even possibly have to kill her and
  so, while looking for an alternative, he steeled himself for the deed he
  loathed; but yet he hoped to escape without that.</p>

  <p><br>
  THE Third Woman, conducting her new mate from the cave to the corral where
  she would keep him imprisoned for a week or two, had heard the cadenced
  beating of naked heels and heavy bludgeons arising from the corral of The
  First Woman and immediately guessed their import. The welfare of the
  offspring of The First Woman concerned her not as an individual. Community
  instinct, however, prompted her to release them that they might search for
  food and their services not be lost to the tribe through starvation. She
  would not feed them, of course, as they did not belong to her, but she would
  open their prison gate and turn them loose to fend for themselves, to find
  food or not to find it, to survive or to perish according to the inexorable
  law of the survival of the fittest.</p>

  <p>But the Third Woman took her time. Her powerful fingers entangled in the
  hair of her snarling spouse she dragged the protesting creature to her
  corral, removed the great slab from before the entrance, pushed the man
  roughly within, accelerating his speed with a final kick, replaced the slab
  and turned leisurely toward the nearby corral of The First Woman. Removing
  the stone door she passed through the two chambers and entered the corral at
  the moment that the oldest girl was advancing upon Tarzan. Pausing by the
  entranceway she struck her bludgeon against the stone wall of the shelter,
  evidently to attract the attention of those within the corral. Instantly all
  looked in her direction. She was the first adult female, other than their own
  dam, that the children of The First Woman had seen. They shrunk from her in
  evident terror. The youth at Tarzan's side slunk behind the ape-man, nor did
  Tarzan wonder at their fear. The Third Woman was the first adult Alalus he
  had seen, since all of the time that he had been in the hands of The First
  Woman he had been unconscious.</p>

  <p>The girl who had been threatening him with her great club seemed now to
  have forgotten him, and instead stood with snarling face and narrowed eyes
  confronting the newcomer. Of all the children she seemed the least
  terrified.</p>

  <p>The ape-man scrutinized the huge, brutish female standing at the far end
  of the corral with her savage eyes upon him. She had not seen him before as
  she had been in the forest hunting at the time that The First Woman had
  brought her prize back to the amphitheater. She had not known that The First
  Woman had any male in her corral other than her own spawn. Here, indeed, was
  a prize. She would remove him to her own corral. With this idea in mind, and
  knowing that, unless he succeeded in dodging past her and reaching the
  entranceway ahead of her, he could not escape her, she moved very slowly
  toward him, ignoring now the other occupants of the corral.</p>

  <p>Tarzan, not guessing her real purpose, thought that she was about to
  attack him as a dangerous alien in the sacred precincts of her home. He
  viewed her great bulk, her enormous muscular development and the huge
  bludgeon swinging in her ham-like hand and compared them with his own
  defenseless nakedness.</p>

  <p>To the jungle-born flight from useless and uneven combat carries with it
  no stigma of cowardice, and not only was Tarzan of the Apes jungle-born and
  jungle-raised, but the stripping of his clothes from him had now, as always
  before, stripped also away the thin and unnatural veneer of his civilization.
  It was, then, a savage beast that faced the oncoming Alalus woman&mdash;a
  cunning beast as well as a powerful one&mdash;a beast that knew when to fight
  and when to flee.</p>

  <p>Tarzan cast a quick glance behind him. There crouched the Alalus lad,
  trembling in fear. Beyond was the rear wall of the corral, one of the great
  stone slabs of which tilted slightly outward. Slow is the mind of man, slower
  his eye by comparison with the eye and the mind of the trapped beast seeking
  escape. So quick was the ape-man that he was gone before The Third Woman had
  guessed that he was contemplating flight, and with him had gone the eldest
  Alalus boy.</p>

  <p>Wheeling, all in a single motion Tarzan had swung the young male to his
  shoulder, leaped swiftly the few paces that had separated him from the rear
  wall of the corral, and, catlike, run up the smooth surface of the slightly
  tilted slab until his fingers closed upon the top, drawn himself over without
  a single backward glance, dropped the youth to the ground upon the opposite
  side, following him so quickly that they alighted almost together. Then he
  glanced about for the first time. He saw the natural amphitheater and the
  caves before several of which women still squatted. It would soon be dark.
  The sun was dropping behind the crest of the western hills. Tarzan saw but a
  single avenue of escape&mdash;the opening at the lower end of the
  amphitheater through which the trail led down into the valley and the forest
  below. Toward this he ran, followed by the youth.</p>

  <p>Presently a woman, sitting before the entrance of her cave, saw him.
  Seizing her cudgel she leaped to her feet and gave immediate chase. Attracted
  by her another and another took up the pursuit, until five or six of them
  thundered along the trail.</p>

  <p>The youth, pointing the way, raced swiftly ahead of the ape-man, but swift
  as he was, he could not outdistance the lithe muscles that had so often in
  the past carried their master safely from the swift rush of a maddened Numa,
  or won him a meal against the fleetness of Bara the deer. The heavy,
  lumbering women behind them had no chance of overhauling this swift pair if
  they were to depend entirely upon speed, but that they had no intention of
  doing. They had their stone missiles with which, almost from birth, they had
  practiced until approximate perfection was attained by each in casting them
  at either stationary or moving targets. But it was growing dark, the trail
  twisted and turned and the speed of the quarry made them elusive marks at
  which to cast an accurate missile that would be so timed as to stun rather
  than to kill. Of course more often than not a missile intended to stun did
  actually kill, but the quarry must take that chance. Instinct warned the
  women against killing the males, though it did not warn them against treating
  them with the utmost brutality. Had Tarzan realized why the women were
  pursuing him he would have run even faster than he did, and when the missiles
  began to fly past his head perhaps he did accelerate his speed a trifle.</p>

  <p>Soon the ape-man reached the forest and as though he had dissolved into
  thin air disappeared from the astonished view of his pursuers, for now,
  indeed, was he in his own element. While they looked for him upon the ground
  he swung swiftly through the lower terraces, keeping in view the Alalus boy
  racing along the trail beneath him.</p>

  <p>But with the man escaped, the women stopped and turned back toward the
  caves. The youth they did not want. For two or three years he would roam the
  forests unmolested by his own kind, and if he escaped the savage beasts and
  the spears and arrows of the ant people he would come to man's estate and be
  fair prey for any of the great shes during the mating season. For the time
  being, at least, he would lead a comparatively safe and happy existence.</p>

  <p>His chances of survival had been materially lessened by his early escape
  into the forest. Had The First Woman lived she would have kept him safely
  within the walls of her corral for another year at least, when he would have
  been better fitted to cope with the dangers and emergencies of the savage
  life of the forest and the jungle.</p>

  <p>The boy, his keen ears telling him that the women had given up the
  pursuit, halted and looked back for the strange creature that had freed him
  from the hated corral, but he could see only a short distance through the
  darkness of the growing forest night. The stranger was not in sight. The
  youth pricked up his great ears and listened intently. There was no sound of
  human footsteps other than the rapidly diminishing ones of the retreating
  women. There were other sounds, however, unfamiliar forest sounds that filled
  his muddy brain with vague terrors&mdash;sounds that came from the
  surrounding underbrush; sounds that came from the branches above his head,
  and, too, there were terrifying odors.</p>

  <p>Darkness, complete and impenetrable, had closed in upon him with a
  suddenness that left him trembling. He could almost feel it weighing down
  upon him, crushing him and at the same time leaving him exposed to nameless
  terrors. He looked about him and could see naught, so that it seemed to him
  that he was without eyes, and being without a voice he could not call out
  either to frighten his enemies or attract the attention of the strange
  creature that had befriended him, and whose presence had so strangely aroused
  in his own breast an inexplicable emotion&mdash;a pleasurable emotion. He
  could not explain it; he had no word for it who had no word for anything, but
  he felt it and it still warmed his bosom and he wished in his muddy way that
  he could make a noise that would attract that strange creature to him again.
  He was lonely and much afraid.</p>

  <p>A crackling of the bushes nearby aroused him to new and more intimate
  terror. Something large was approaching through the black night. The youth
  stood with his back against a great tree. He dared not move. He sniffed but
  what movement of the air there was took course from him in the direction of
  the thing that was creeping upon him out of the terrible forest, and so he
  could not identify it; but his instinct told him that the creature had
  identified him and was doubtless creeping closer to leap upon him and devour
  him.</p>

  <p>He knew naught of lions, unless instinct carries with it a picture of the
  various creatures of which the denizens of the wild are instinctively afraid.
  In all his life he had never been outside the corral of The First Woman and
  as his people are without speech his dam could have told him nothing of the
  outside world, yet when the lion roared he knew that it was a lion.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ESTEBAN MIRANDA, clinging tightly to the wrist of little
  Uhha, crouched in the darkness of another forest twenty miles away and
  trembled as the thunderous notes of another lion reverberated through the
  jungle.</p>

  <p>The girl felt the trembling of the body of the big man at her side and
  turned contemptuously upon him.</p>

  <p>"You are not the river devil!" she cried. "You are afraid. You are not
  even Tarzan, for Khamis, my father, has told me that Tarzan is afraid of
  nothing. Let me go that I may climb a tree&mdash;only a coward or a fool
  would stand here dead with terror waiting for the lion to come and devour
  him. Let me go, I say!" and she attempted to wrench her wrist free from his
  grasp.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" he hissed. "Do you want to attract the lion to us?" But her
  words and struggles had aroused him from his paralysis and stooping he seized
  her and lifted her until she could grasp the lower branches of the tree
  beneath which they stood. Then, as she clambered to safety, he swung himself
  easily to her side.</p>

  <p>Presently, higher up among the branches, he found a safer and more
  comfortable resting place, and there the two settled down to await the coming
  of the dawn, while below them Numa the lion prowled for a while, coughing and
  grunting, and occasionally voicing a deep roar that shook the jungle.</p>

  <p>When daylight came at last the two, exhausted by a sleepless night,
  slipped to the ground. The girl would have delayed, hoping that the warriors
  of Obebe might overtake them; but the man harbored a fear rather than a hope
  of the same contingency and was, therefore, for hastening on as rapidly as
  possible that he might put the greatest possible distance between himself and
  the black cannibal chief.</p>

  <p>He was completely lost, having not the remotest idea of where he should
  search for a reasonably good trail to the coast, nor, at present, did he
  care; his one wish being to escape recapture by Obebe, and so he elected to
  move northward, keeping always an eye open for any indication of a
  well-marked trail toward the west. Eventually, he hoped, he might discover a
  village of friendly natives who would aid him upon his journey toward the
  coast, and so the two moved as rapidly as they could in a northerly
  direction, their way skirting the Great Thorn Forest along the eastern edge
  of which they traveled.</p>

  <p><br>
  THE sun beating down upon the hot corral of The First Woman found it deserted
  of life. Only the corpse of a youth lay sprawled where it had fallen the
  previous evening. A speck appeared in the distant blue. It grew larger as it
  approached until it took upon itself the form of a bird gliding easily upon
  motionless wings. Nearer and nearer it came, now and again winging great,
  slow circles, until at last it swung above the corral of The First Woman.
  Once again it circled and then dropped to earth within the
  enclosure&mdash;Ska, the vulture, had come. Within the hour the body of the
  youth was hidden by a mantle of the great birds. It was a two-days feast, and
  when they left, only the clean picked bones remained, and entangled about the
  neck of one of the birds was a golden chain from which depended a
  diamond-encrusted locket. Ska fought the bauble that swung annoyingly beneath
  him when he flew and impeded his progress when he walked upon the ground, but
  it was looped twice about his neck and he was unable to dislodge it, and so
  he winged away across The Great Thorn Forest, the bright gems gleaming and
  scintillating in the sun.</p>

  <p><br>
  TARZAN of the Apes, after eluding the women that had chased him and the
  Alalus youth into the forest, halted in the tree beneath which the frightened
  son of The First Woman had come to a terrified pause. He was there, close
  above him, when Numa charged, and reaching quickly down had seized the youth
  by the hair and dragged him to safety as the lion's raking talons embraced
  thin air beneath the feet of the Alalus.</p>

  <p>The following day the ape-man concerned himself seriously in the hunt for
  food, weapons and apparel. Naked and unarmed as he was it might have gone
  hard with him had he been other than Tarzan of the Apes, and it might have
  gone hard with the Alalus had it not been for the ape-man. Fruits and nuts
  Tarzan found, and birds' eggs, but he craved meat and for meat he hunted
  assiduously, not alone because of the flesh of the kill, but for the skin and
  the gut and the tendons, that he could use in the fabrication of the things
  he required for the safety and comfort of his primitive existence.</p>

  <p>As he searched for the spoor of his prey he searched also for the proper
  woods for a spear and for bow and arrows, nor were they difficult to find in
  this forest of familiar trees, but the day was almost done before the gentle
  wind, up which he had been hunting, carried to his sensitive nostrils the
  scent spoor of Bara the deer.</p>

  <p>Swinging into a tree he motioned the Alalus to follow him, but so inept
  and awkward was the creature that Tarzan was compelled to drag him to a place
  among the branches, where, by signs, he attempted to impart to him the fact
  that he wished him to remain where he was, watching the materials that the
  ape-man had collected for his weapons, while the latter continued the hunt
  alone.</p><a id="pic10"

    <p class="caption">Tarzan attempted to impart to him the fact that he
    wished him to remain where he was.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>That the youth understood him he was not at all sure, but at least he did
  not follow when Tarzan swung off silently through the branches of the forest
  along the elusive trail of the ruminant, the scent of which was always
  translated to the foster son of Kala the she-ape as Bara the deer, though in
  fact, as practically always, the animal was an antelope. But strong are the
  impressions of childhood and since that long-gone day upon which he had pored
  over the colored alphabet primer in the far-off cabin of his dead father
  beside the landlocked harbor on the West Coast, and learned that "D stands
  for Deer," and had admired the picture of the pretty animal, the thing that
  most closely resembled it, with which he was familiar in his daily life, the
  antelope, became for him then, and always remained, Bara the deer.</p>

  <p>To approach sufficiently close to Bara to bring him down with spear or
  arrow requires cunning and woodcraft far beyond the limited range of
  civilized man's ability. The native hunter loses more often than he wins in
  this game of wits and percipience. Tarzan, however, must excel them both and
  the antelope, too, in the keenness of his perceptive faculties and in
  coordination of mind and muscles if he were to lay Bara low with only the
  weapons with which nature had endowed him.</p>

  <p>As Tarzan sped silently through the jungle, guided by his nostrils, in the
  direction of Bara the deer increasing strength of the familiar effluvium
  apprised him that not far ahead Bara foregathered in numbers, and the mouth
  of the savage ape-man watered in anticipation of the feast that but awaited
  his coming. And as the strength of the scent increased, more warily went the
  great beast, moving silently, a shadow among the shadows of the forest, until
  he came at last to the verge of an opening in which he saw a dozen antelope
  grazing.</p>

  <p>Squatting motionless upon a low hanging limb the ape-man watched the
  movements of the herd against the moment that one might come close enough to
  the encircling trees to give a charge at least a shadow of a chance for
  success. To wait patiently, oftentimes hour upon hour, for the quarry to
  expose itself to more certain death is a part of the great game that the
  hunters of the wild must play. A single ill-timed or thoughtless movement may
  send the timorous prey scampering off into the far distance from which they
  may not return for days.</p>

  <p>To avoid this Tarzan remained in statuesque immobility waiting for chance
  to send one of the antelope within striking distance, and while he waited
  there came to his nostrils, faintly, the scent of Numa the lion. Tarzan
  scowled. He was downwind from Bara and the lion was not between him and the
  antelope. It must, therefore, be upwind from the quarry as well as from
  himself; but why had not the sensitive nostrils of the herbivores caught the
  scent of their archenemy before it had reached the ape-man; that they had not
  was evidenced by their placidity as they grazed contentedly, their tails
  switching and occasionally a head raised to look about with up-pricked ears
  though with no symptom of the terror that would immediately follow the
  discovery of Numa in their vicinity.</p>

  <p>The ape-man concluded that one of those freaks of the air currents that so
  often leave a motionless pocket of air directly in the path of the flow had
  momentarily surrounded the antelope, insulating them, as it were, from their
  immediate surroundings. And while he was thinking these things and wishing
  that Numa would go away he was shocked to hear a sudden crashing in the
  underbrush upon the opposite side of the clearing beyond the antelope, who
  were instantly upon the alert and poised for flight. Almost simultaneously
  there broke into view a young lion which, upon coming in sight of the
  antelope, set up a terrific roaring as it charged. Tarzan could have torn his
  hair in rage and disappointment. The blundering stupidity of a young lion had
  robbed him of his meat&mdash;the ruminants were scattering in all directions.
  The lion, charging futilely, had lost his own meat and Tarzan's too; but
  wait! What was this? A terrified buck, blind to all save the single thought
  of escape from the talons of the dread carnivore, was bolting straight for
  the tree in which Tarzan sat. As it came beneath him a sleek brown body shot
  head-foremost from the foliage, steel fingers gripped the throat of the buck,
  strong teeth fastened in its neck. The weight of the savage hunter carried
  the quarry to its knees and before it could stumble to its feet again a quick
  wrench with those powerful hands had twisted and broken its neck.</p>

  <p>Without a backward glance the ape-man threw the carcass to his shoulder
  and leaped into the nearest tree. He had no need to waste time in looking
  back to know what Numa would be doing, for he realized that he had leaped
  upon Bara full in the sight of the king of beasts. Scarce had he drawn
  himself to safety ere the great cat crashed across the spot where he had
  stood.</p>

  <p>Numa, baffled, roared terribly as he returned to glare up at the ape-man
  perched above him. Tarzan smiled.</p>

  <p>"Son of Dango, the hyena," he taunted, "go hungry until you learn to
  hunt," and casting a broken branch contemptuously in the lion's face the
  ape-man vanished among the leafy branches bearing his kill lightly across one
  broad shoulder.</p>

  <p>It was still daylight when Tarzan returned to where the Alalus was
  awaiting him. The youth had a small stone knife and with this the ape-man
  hacked off a generous portion of the antelope for the whelp of The First
  Woman and another for himself. Into the raw flesh, hungrily, sank the strong
  white teeth of the English lord, while the Alalus youth, gazing at him in
  surprise, sought materials for fire making. Amused, Tarzan watched him until
  the other had succeeded in preparing his food as he thought it should be
  prepared&mdash;the outside burned to a cinder, the inside raw, yet it was
  cooked food and doubtless imparted to its partaker a feeling of great
  superiority over the low beasts that devoured their meat raw, just as though
  he had been a civilized epicure eating decaying game and putrid cheeses at
  some fashionable club in London.</p>

  <p>Tarzan smiled as he thought how vague, after all, the line that separates
  primitive from civilized man in matters pertaining to their instincts and
  their appetites. Some of his French friends, with whom he was dining upon a
  certain occasion, were horrified when they learned that in common with many
  of the African tribes and the apes he ate caterpillars, and they voiced their
  horror between mouthfuls of the snails they were eating with relish at the
  time. The provincial American scoffs at the French for eating frogs' legs,
  the while he munches upon the leg of a pig! The Esquimaux eat raw blubber,
  the Amazonians, both white and native, eat the contents of the stomachs of
  parrots and monkeys and consider them delicacies, the Chinese coolie asks not
  how his meat came by its death, nor how long since, and there is a man in New
  York, an estimable and otherwise harmless man, who eats Limburger cheese on
  Bartlett pears.</p>

  <p>The following day, with sufficient meat to last them several days, Tarzan
  set to work upon his weapons and his loincloth. Showing the Alalus how to
  scrape the antelope hide with his stone knife, the ape-man set to work, with
  nothing more in the way of tools than bits of stone picked from the bed of a
  stream, to fashion weapons with which to cope successfully with the Alali
  women, the great carnivores and whatever other enemies time might reveal to
  him.</p>

  <p>And as he worked he watched the Alalus youth and wondered of what use the
  poor creature could be to him in finding his way through the encircling thorn
  forest that he must pass to reach familiar country and the trail for home.
  That the poor thing was timid had been evidenced by its manner when fleeing
  from the Alali women and its terror when confronted by Numa. Its
  speechlessness made it useless as a companion and it was entirely without
  woodcraft other than a certain crude, instinctive kind that was of no use to
  Tarzan. But it had placed itself at his side during the altercation in the
  corral and although it could not have been of any help to him yet it had won
  a right to his consideration by its act. Moreover it was evident, quite
  evident, that the creature had attached itself to Tarzan and intended to
  remain with him.</p>

  <p>An idea occurred to Tarzan as he worked upon his weapons and thought upon
  the Alalus&mdash;he would make similar weapons for the youth and teach him
  how to use them. He had seen that the crude weapons of the Alali would be no
  match against one armed with a bow and arrows, or even a good spear.
  Accurately they could not hope to throw their missiles as far as a good
  bowman could speed his shaft and their bludgeons were helpless in the face of
  a well-thrown spear.</p>

  <p>Yes, he would make weapons for the youth and train him in their use and
  then he could be made of service in the hunt and, if necessary, in the fight,
  and as Tarzan of the Apes thought upon the matter the Alalus suddenly paused
  in his work and bent an ear close to the ground, then he lifted his head and
  turned his eyes upon Tarzan, pointing at him, at his ear, and then at the
  ground. The ape-man understood that he was to listen as the other had and
  when he did so he distinctly heard approaching footsteps resounding upon the
  hard-worn trail.</p>

  <p>Gathering up his belongings he carried them high among the trees to a safe
  cache with the remnants of Bara the deer and then returning helped the youth
  into the tree beside him.</p><a id="pic11"

    <p class="caption">Tarzan helped the youth into the tree beside him.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Slowly, already, the Alalus was becoming more at ease in the trees and
  could help himself to a greater extent in climbing into them, but he was
  still practically helpless in Tarzan's estimation.</p>

  <p>The two had not long to wait before there swung down the trail one of the
  terrible women of the amphitheater, and behind her at ten or fifteen paces
  another, and behind the second a third. It was not often that they traveled
  thus, for theirs was a solitary existence, the Alali being almost devoid of
  gregarious instincts, yet they did occasionally start out upon their hunts
  together, especially when they were hunting some dangerous beast that had
  encroached upon their rights, or when, failing to collect sufficient men from
  the forest during the mating season, the unfortunate ones banded together to
  make a raid upon the corrals of a neighboring tribe.</p>

  <p>The three, slouching along the trail, passed directly beneath the tree
  from which Tarzan and the youth watched them. The great, flat ears flapped
  lazily, the dark eyes wandered from side to side, and from time to time they
  moved rapidly the skin upon some portions of their bodies as they sought to
  dislodge annoying insects.</p>

  <p>The two in the tree remained motionless while the three brute-women passed
  along down the trail to be presently lost to their view at a turning of the
  forest highway, then, after a short interval of listening, they descended to
  the ground and resumed their interrupted labors. The ape-man smiled as he
  idly pondered the events of the past few minutes&mdash;Tarzan of the Apes,
  Lord of the Jungle, hiding among the trees to escape the notice of three
  women! But such women! He knew little about them or their ways as yet, but
  what he did know was sufficient to convince him that they were as formidable
  foes as ever he had encountered and that while he remained weaponless he was
  no match against their great bludgeons and swift-thrown missiles.</p>

  <p>The days passed; the ape-man and his silent companion perfected the
  weapons that would more easily give them food, the latter working
  mechanically, following the instructions of his master, until at last the
  time came when Tarzan and the Alalus were fully equipped and then they hunted
  together, the man training the youth in the use of bow and spear and the long
  grass rope that from boyhood had formed a unique feature of the ape-man's
  armament.</p>

  <p>During these days of hunting there came over the Alalus youth, quite
  suddenly, a great change. It had been his habit to glide stealthily through
  the forest, stopping often to look this way and that, fearful, apparently, of
  every creature that roamed the shadowed trails; his one great fear the
  ferocious females of his kind; but suddenly all this changed as by magic.
  Slowly he was mastering the bow and the spear; with deep interest and a sense
  of awe and respect he had watched Tarzan bring down many animals, great and
  small, for food, and once he had seen him dispatch Sabor the lioness with a
  single thrust of his great spear when Sabor had caught the ape-man in a
  clearing too far from the sanctuary of his beloved trees, and then his own
  day came. He and Tarzan were hunting when the former disturbed a small herd
  of wild pigs, bringing down two with his arrows. The others scattered in all
  directions and one of these, a boar, sighting the Alalus, charged him. The
  youth was of a mind to flee, for ages of inherited instinct prompted him to
  flight. Always the male Alalus fled from danger, and between fleeing from
  carnivorous animals and from their own women they had become very swift, so
  swift that no dangerous enemy could overtake them&mdash;an Alalus man could
  be captured only by craft. He could have escaped the boar by flight and for
  an instant he was upon the verge of flight, but a sudden thought checked
  him&mdash;back flew his spear hand as the ape-man had taught him and then
  forward with all the weight of his body behind the cast. The boar was coming
  straight for him. The spear struck in front of the left shoulder and ranged
  downward through the heart. Horta the boar dropped in his tracks.</p>

  <p>A new expression came into the eyes and spread over the countenance of the
  Alalus. He no longer wore that hunted expression; he no longer slunk through
  the forest casting fearful glances from side to side. Now he walked erect,
  boldly and with fearless mien, and, perhaps, instead of dreading the
  appearance of a female he rather courted the event. He was the
  personification of avenging manhood. Within him rankled countless ages of
  contemptuous treatment and abuse at the hands of his shes. Doubtless he never
  thought of the matter in this way at all, but the fact remained, and Tarzan
  realized it, that the first woman unfortunate enough to stumble upon this
  youth was going to get the surprise of her life.</p>

  <p><br>
  AND while Tarzan and the Alalus roamed the strange land hemmed in by The
  Great Thorn Forest and the ape-man sought for an avenue of escape, Esteban
  Miranda and little Uhha, daughter of Khamis the witch doctor, wandered along
  the forest's outer verge in search of a trail toward the west and the
  coast.</p>

  <p class="first">WITH doglike devotion the Alalus youth clung to Tarzan. The
  latter had mastered the meager sign language of his protégé, giving them a
  means of communication that was adequate for all their needs. The former,
  gaining confidence with a growing familiarity with his new weapons, became
  more independent, with the result that the two more often separated for the
  hunt, thus insuring a more fully stocked larder.</p><a id="pic12"

    <p class="caption">With doglike devotion the Alalus youth clung to
    Tarzan.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>It was upon one of these occasions that Tarzan came suddenly upon a
  strange sight. He had been following the scent spoor of Bara the deer when it
  was suddenly crossed by that of one of the great female Alali. That probably
  meant that another would attempt to rob him of his prey. The savage instinct
  of the jungle beast predominated in the guidance of the breech-clouted
  ape-man. It was not the polished Lord Greystoke of London whose snarling
  upper lip revealed two gleaming fighting fangs&mdash;it was a primordial
  hunting-brute about to be robbed of its quarry.</p>

  <p>Taking to the trees he moved rapidly in the direction of the Alalus woman,
  but before he came within sight of her a new scent impinged upon his
  nostrils&mdash;a strange, new scent that puzzled him. It was the scent of
  man, yet strange and unfamiliar to a degree. Never before had anything like
  it arrested his attention. It was very faint and yet, somehow, he knew that
  it was close, and then, ahead of him, he heard voices, low musical voices,
  that came faintly to his ears; and though they were low and musical there was
  something in the quality and pitch of them that suggested excitement. Now
  Tarzan went more carefully, Bara, the deer, all but forgotten.</p>

  <p>As he drew nearer he realized that there were many voices and much
  commotion and then he came upon a large plain that stretched away to distant
  hills, and in the foreground, not a hundred yards from him, he looked upon a
  sight that might well have caused him to doubt the veracity of his own eyes.
  The only familiar figure was a giant Alalus woman. Surrounding her was a
  horde of diminutive men&mdash;tiny white warriors&mdash;mounted upon what
  appeared to be a form of the Royal Antelope of the West Coast. Armed with
  lances and swords they repeatedly charged at the huge legs of the Alalus,
  who, backing slowly toward the forest, kicked viciously at her assailants and
  struck at them with her heavy bludgeon.</p><a id="pic13"
        name="pic13"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0600651h-images/TarzanAndTheAntMen-13.jpg"

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">Surrounding her was a horde of diminutive men&mdash;tiny
    white warriors.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>It quickly became evident to Tarzan that they were attempting to hamstring
  her and had they been successful they might easily have slain her then; but
  though there must have been fully a hundred of them their chances of success
  appeared small, since, with a single kick of her mighty foot the woman could
  lay low a dozen or more of her assailants at a time. Already fully half the
  force was <i>hors de combat</i>, their bodies with those of many of their mounts
  being scattered out onto the plain marking the trail of the combat up to the
  time that Tarzan had come upon the scene.</p>

  <p>The courage of the survivors, however, filled Tarzan with admiration as he
  watched them hurl themselves upon almost certain death in their stubborn
  efforts to bring down the female, and then it was that the ape-man saw the
  reason, or the apparent reason, for the mad sacrifice of life&mdash;in her
  left hand the Alalus clutched one of the tiny warriors. It was to rescue him,
  evidently, that the others were maintaining this forlorn hope.</p>

  <p>If the warriors filled Tarzan with admiration to scarcely a lesser extent
  did their courageous and agile mounts. Always had he thought of the Royal
  Antelope, the smallest known member of its family, as the most timid of
  creatures, but not so these cousins of theirs. Slightly larger, standing
  perhaps fifteen inches at the withers, they were in all other outward
  respects identical; yet, at the guidance of their riders, they leaped
  fearlessly into close range of those enormous feet and the great, slashing
  bludgeon. Perfectly reined were they, too; so perfectly that their muscles
  seemed to have coordinated with the minds of their riders. In and out they
  bounded, scarcely touching the ground before they were out of harm's way
  again. Ten or a dozen feet they covered at a leap, so that Tarzan wondered
  not only at their agility but at the almost marvelous riding ability of the
  warriors who could keep their seats so perfectly upon these leaping,
  bounding, turning, twisting mounts.</p>

  <p>It was a pretty sight and an inspiring one, and however unreal it had at
  first appeared to him he was not long in realizing that he was looking upon a
  race of real pygmies&mdash;not members of the black tribe with which all
  African explorers are more or less familiar, but with that lost white race of
  diminutive men reference to which is occasionally to be found in ancient
  manuscript of travel and exploration, of myth and legend.</p>

  <p>While the encounter interested him and he viewed it at first as a
  disinterested neutral he soon found his sympathies gravitating to the tiny
  warriors and when it became evident that the Alalus woman was going to make
  good her escape into the forest with her captive, the ape-man decided to take
  a hand in the affair himself.</p>

  <p>As he stepped from the concealment of the forest the little warriors were
  the first to see him. Evidently they mistook him at first for another of
  their giant enemies, for a great cry of disappointment rose from them, and
  they fell back for the first time since Tarzan had been watching the unequal
  struggle. Wishing to make his intentions clear before the little men set upon
  him he moved quickly in the direction of the woman, who, the instant that her
  eyes fell upon him, made imperative signs for him to join her in dispatching
  the balance of the pygmies. She was accustomed to being feared and obeyed by
  her mankind, when she had them in her power. Perhaps she wondered a little at
  the temerity of this he, for as a rule they all ran from her; but she needed
  him badly and that was the idea that dominated her thoughts.</p>

  <p>As Tarzan advanced he commanded her in the sign language he had learned
  from the youth that she was to release her captive and go away, molesting the
  little men no more. At this she made an ugly grimace and raising her bludgeon
  came forward to meet him. The ape-man fitted an arrow to his bow.</p>

  <p>"Go back!" he signed her. "Go back, or I will kill you. Go back, and put
  down the little man."</p>

  <p>She snarled ferociously and increased her pace. Tarzan raised the arrow to
  the level of his eye and drew it back until the bow bent. The pygmies,
  realizing that for the moment at least this strange giant was their ally, sat
  their mounts and awaited the outcome of the duel. The ape-man hoped that the
  woman would obey his commands before he was compelled to take her life, but
  even a cursory glance at her face revealed anything but an intention to
  relinquish her purpose, which now seemed to be to annihilate this
  presumptuous meddler as well.</p>

  <p>On she came. Already she was too close to make further delay safe and the
  ape-man released his shaft. Straight into her savage heart it drove and as
  she stumbled forward Tarzan leaped to meet her, seizing the warrior from her
  grasp before she might fall upon the tiny body and crush it, and as he did so
  the other warriors, evidently mistaking his intentions, spurred forward with
  loud shouts and brandishing weapons; but before they had reached him he had
  set the rescued man upon the ground and released him.</p>

  <p>Instantly the attitude of the charging pygmies changed again and from war
  cries their tones turned to cheers. Riding forward they drew rein before the
  warrior that Tarzan had rescued and several of their number leaped from their
  mounts and, kneeling, raised his hand to their lips. It was evident then to
  the ape-man that he had rescued one who stood high among them, their chief,
  perhaps; and now he wondered what would be their attitude toward him, as,
  with a look of amused tolerance upon his grim features, he watched them as
  one might watch the interesting doings of a swarm of ants.</p><a id="pic14"

    <p class="caption">Tarzan watched them as one might watch the interesting
    doings of a swarm of ants.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>As they felicitated their fellow upon his miraculous escape Tarzan had an
  opportunity to inspect them more closely. The tallest of them stood about
  eighteen inches in height, their white skins were tanned by exposure to a
  shade a trifle darker than his own, yet there was no question but that they
  were white men; their features were regular and well proportioned, so that by
  any standards of our race they would have been considered handsome. There
  were, of course, variations and exceptions; but on the whole those that he
  saw before him were fine-looking men. All were smooth-faced and there seemed
  to be no very old men among them, while he whom Tarzan had saved from the
  Alalus woman was apparently younger than the average, and much younger than
  those who had dismounted to do him homage.</p>

  <p>As Tarzan watched them the young man bade the others rise and then
  addressed them for a moment after which he turned toward the ape-man and
  directed his remarks to him, none of which, of course, Tarzan could
  understand. By his manner, however, he guessed that the other was thanking
  him and possibly too asking his further intentions toward them and in reply
  the ape-man endeavored to assure them that he desired their friendship.
  Further to emphasize his peaceful intentions he cast his weapons aside and
  took a step toward them, his arms thrown slightly outward, his open palms in
  their direction.</p>

  <p>The young man seemed to understand his friendly overtures, for he too
  advanced, offering his hand to Tarzan. The ape-man knew that the other meant
  that he should kiss it, but this he did not do, preferring to assume a role
  of equality with their highest. Instead, he kneeled upon one knee that he
  might more easily reach the proffered hand of the pygmy and pressing the tiny
  fingers gently, inclined his head slightly in a formal bow which carried no
  suggestion of servility. The other seemed satisfied, returned the bow with
  equal dignity and then attempted to convey to the ape-man that he and his
  party were about to ride off across the plain, inviting him to accompany
  them.</p>

  <p>Rather curious to see more of these remarkable little people Tarzan was
  nothing loath to accept the invitation. Before the party set out, however,
  they dispersed to gather up their dead and wounded and to put out of their
  misery any of the injured antelope that were too severely hurt to travel.
  This they did with the relatively long, straight sword which was part of the
  armament of each. Their lances they left resting in cylindrical boots
  attached to the right side of their saddles. For other weapons Tarzan could
  discover nothing but a tiny knife carried in a scabbard at the right side by
  each warrior. The blade, like the blade of the rapier, was two edged but only
  about an inch and a half long, with a very sharp point.</p>

  <p>Having gathered the dead and wounded, the latter were examined by the
  young leader of the party, who was accompanied by the five or six who had
  gathered about him at the time that Tarzan had released him. These Tarzan
  took to be lieutenants, or under-chiefs. He saw them question the wounded and
  in three cases, each evidently a hopeless one, the leader ran his sword
  quickly through the hearts of the unhappy men.</p>

  <p>While this seemingly cruel, yet unquestionably sound, military measure was
  being carried out, the balance of the warriors, directed by under-officers,
  were excavating a long trench beside the dead, of which there were twenty,
  their tool being a stout shovel blade carried attached to the saddle and
  which could be quickly fitted to the butt of the spear or lance. The men
  worked with extreme rapidity and under a plan that seemed to abhor lost
  motion, of which there was the absolute minimum, until in an incredibly short
  time they had excavated a trench fifty inches in length, eighteen inches wide
  and nine inches deep, the equivalent of which to men of normal size would
  have been nearly seventeen feet long, six feet wide and three feet deep. Into
  this they packed the dead like sardines and in two layers. They then shoveled
  back sufficient earth to fill the interstices between the bodies and to come
  to a level with the top of the upper layer, after which loose stones were
  rolled in until the bodies were entirely covered by two inches of stones. The
  remaining earth from the excavation was then piled over all.</p>

  <p>By the time this work was completed the loose antelope had been caught and
  the wounded strapped to their backs. At a word from their commander the party
  formed with military precision, a detail started ahead with the wounded and a
  moment later the balance of the troop was mounted and on the way. The method
  of mounting and taking up the march was unique and a source of considerable
  interest to Tarzan. The dismounted warriors were standing in line facing the
  young leader who was mounted, as were the several officers who accompanied
  him. Each warrior held his mount by the bridle. The commander made a rapid
  signal with the raised point of his sword&mdash;there was no spoken word of
  command&mdash;immediately after which he dropped the point quickly at his
  side simultaneously wheeling his mount, which leaped quickly off in the
  direction that the troop was facing, the mounts of his officers wheeling with
  him as though actuated by a single brain, and at the same instant the mount
  of each alternate warrior in the line leaped forward and as it leaped its
  rider swung to his saddle, vaulting to his seat as lightly as a feather. The
  instant the first line had cleared them the antelopes of the second line
  leaped in pursuit, their riders mounted as had the others before them and
  with a second and longer leap the intervals were closed and the whole troop
  raced forward in a compact line. It was a most clever and practical evolution
  and one that made it possible to put mounted troops in motion as rapidly as
  foot troops; there was no long delay caused by taking distance, mounting and
  closing ranks.</p>

  <p>As the troop galloped away ten warriors wheeled from the left flank and,
  following one of the officers who had detached himself from the party of the
  commander of the troop, returned to Tarzan. By signs the officer conveyed to
  the ape-man the intelligence that he was to follow this party which would
  guide him to their destination. Already the main body was far away across the
  open plain, their lithe mounts clearing as many as five or six feet in a
  single bound. Even the swift Tarzan could not have kept pace with them.</p>

  <p>As the ape-man started away under the guidance of the detachment his
  thoughts reverted for an instant to the Alalus youth who was hunting alone in
  the forest behind them, but he soon put the creature from his mind with the
  realization that it was better equipped to defend itself than any of its
  kind, and that when he had made his visit to the country of the pygmies he
  could doubtless return and find the Alalus, if he so desired.</p>

  <p>Tarzan, inured to hardship and to long and rapid marches, fell into a
  dogtrot such as he could keep up for hours at a time without rest, while his
  guides, trotting their graceful mounts, kept just ahead of him. The plain was
  more rolling than it had appeared from the verge of the forest, with here and
  there a clump of trees; the grass was plentiful and there were occasional
  bands of the larger species of antelope grazing at intervals. At sight of the
  approaching riders and the comparatively giant-like figure of Tarzan they
  broke and ran. Once they passed a rhinoceros, the party making only a slight
  detour to avoid it, and later, in a clump of trees, the leader halted his
  detachment suddenly and seizing his lance advanced again slowly toward a
  clump of bushes at the same time transmitting an order to his men which
  caused them to spread and surround the thicket.</p>

  <p>Tarzan halted and watched the proceedings. The wind was blowing from him
  in the direction of the thicket, so that he could not determine what manner
  of creature, if any, had attracted the attention of the officer; but
  presently, when the warriors had completely surrounded the bushes and those
  upon the other side had ridden into it, their spears couched and ready, he
  heard an ugly snarl issuing from the center of the thicket and an instant
  later an African wildcat sprang into view, leaping directly at the officer
  waiting with ready spear to receive it. The weight and momentum of the beast
  all but unseated the rider, the point of whose spear had met the cat full in
  the chest. There were a few spasmodic struggles before death ensued, during
  which, had the spear broken, the man would have been badly mauled and perhaps
  killed, for the cat was relatively as formidable a beast as is the lion to
  us. The instant that it died four warriors leaped forward and with their
  sharp knives removed the head and skin in an incredibly short time.</p>

  <p>Tarzan could not but note that everything these people did was
  accomplished with maximum efficiency. Never did there seem to be any lost
  motion, never was one at a loss as to what to do, never did one worker get in
  the way of another. Scarcely ten minutes had elapsed from the moment that
  they had encountered the cat before the detachment was again moving, the head
  of the beast fastened to the saddle of one of the warriors, the skin to that
  of another.</p>

  <p>The officer who commanded the detachment was a young fellow, not much, if
  any, older than the commander of the troop. That he was courageous Tarzan
  could bear witness from the manner in which he had faced what must have been,
  to so diminutive a people, a most deadly and ferocious beast; but then, the
  entire party's hopeless attack upon the Alalus woman had proved that they all
  were courageous, and the ape-man admired and respected courage. Already he
  liked these little men, though it was at times still difficult for him to
  accept them as a reality, so prone are we to disbelieve in the possibility of
  the existence of any form of life with which we are not familiar by
  association or credible repute.</p>

  <p>They had been traveling for almost six hours across the plain, the wind
  had changed and there was borne to Tarzan's nostrils clearly the scent of
  Bara the deer, ahead. The ape-man, who had tasted no food that day, was
  ravenous, with the result that the odor of meat aroused all the savage
  instincts fostered by his strange upbringing. Springing forward abreast the
  leader of the detachment that was escorting him he signed them to halt and
  then as clearly as he could through the comparatively laborious and never
  quite satisfactory medium of further signs explained that he was hungry, that
  there was meat ahead and that they should remain in the rear until he had
  stalked his prey and made his kill.</p>

  <p>The officer having understood and signified his assent Tarzan crept
  stealthily forward toward a small clump of trees beyond which his keen scent
  told him there were several antelope, and behind Tarzan followed the
  detachment, so noiselessly that even the keen ears of the ape-man heard them
  not.</p>

  <p>Sheltered by the trees Tarzan saw a dozen or more antelope grazing a short
  distance beyond, the nearest being scarce a hundred feet from the small
  grove. Unslinging his bow and taking a handful of arrows from his quiver, the
  ape-man moved noiselessly to the tree nearest the antelope. The detachment
  was not far behind him, though it had stopped the moment the officer saw the
  game that Tarzan was stalking, lest it be frightened away.</p>

  <p>The pygmies knew naught of bows and arrows and so they watched with deep
  interest every move of the ape-man. They saw him fit an arrow to his bow,
  draw it far back and release it almost all in a single movement, so quick
  with this weapon was he, and they saw the antelope leap to the impact of the
  missile which was followed in rapid succession by a second and a third, and
  as he shot his bolts Tarzan leaped forward in pursuit of his prey; but there
  was no danger that he would lose it. With the second arrow the buck was upon
  his knees and when Tarzan reached him he was already dead.</p>

  <p>The warriors who had followed close behind Tarzan the instant that there
  was no further need for caution were already surrounding the antelope, where
  they were talking with much more excitement than Tarzan had seen them display
  upon any previous occasion, their interest seemingly centered about the
  death-dealing projectiles that had so easily laid the great animal low, for
  to them this antelope was as large as would be the largest elephant to us;
  and as they caught the ape-man's eye they smiled and rubbed their palms
  together very rapidly with a circular motion, an act which Tarzan assumed to
  be in the nature of applause.</p>

  <p>Having withdrawn his arrows and returned them to his quiver Tarzan signed
  to the leader of the detachment that he would borrow his rapier. For an
  instant the man seemed to hesitate and all his fellows watched him intently,
  but he drew the sword and passed it hilt foremost to the ape-man. If you are
  going to eat flesh raw while it is still warm you do not bleed the carcass,
  nor did Tarzan in this instance. Instead he merely cut off a hind quarter,
  sliced off what he wanted and fell to devouring it hungrily.</p>

  <p>The little men viewed his act with surprise not unmixed with horror and
  when he offered them some of the flesh they refused it and drew away. What
  their reaction was he could not know, but he guessed that they held a strong
  aversion to the eating of raw meat. Later he was to learn that their
  revulsion was due to the fact that within the entire range of their
  experience, heretofore, the only creatures that devoured raw meat devoured
  the pygmies as well. When, therefore, they saw this mighty giant eating the
  flesh of his kill raw they could not but draw the conclusion that should he
  become sufficiently hungry he would eat them.</p>

  <p>Wrapping some of the meat of the antelope in its own skin Tarzan secured
  it to his back and the party resumed its journey. The warriors now seemed
  troubled and as they conversed in low tones they cast many backward glances
  in the direction of the ape-man. They were not afraid for themselves, for
  these warriors scarcely knew the meaning of fear. The question that caused
  them apprehension related to the wisdom of leading among their people such a
  huge devourer of raw flesh, who, at a single hurried meal, had eaten the
  equivalent of a grown man.</p>

  <p>The afternoon was drawing to a close when Tarzan discerned in the far
  distance what appeared to be a group of symmetrical, dome-shaped hillocks and
  later, as they approached these, he saw a body of mounted warriors galloping
  to meet them. From his greater height he saw these before the others saw
  them, and attracting the officer's attention made signs apprising the latter
  of his discovery, but the oncoming warriors were hidden from the view of
  their fellows by the inequalities of the ground.</p>

  <p>Realizing this Tarzan stooped and, before the officer could guess his
  intention, had gathered antelope and rider gently in his powerful hands and
  lifted them high above the ground. For an instant consternation held the
  remaining warriors. Swords flashed and a warning cry arose and even the
  plucky pygmy in his grasp drew his own diminutive weapon; but a smile from
  the ape-man reassured them all, and an instant later the officer saw why
  Tarzan had raised him aloft. He called down to the others below him then and
  from their manner as from that of him whom he held the ape-man guessed that
  the approaching party was composed of friends of his escort, and so, a few
  minutes later, it proved when he was surrounded by several hundreds of the
  pygmies, all friendly, eager and curious. Among them was the leader whom he
  had rescued from the Alalus woman and him he greeted with a handshake.</p>

  <p>A consultation now took place between the leader of the detachment that
  had escorted the ape-man, the young commander of the larger party and several
  older warriors. By the expressions of their faces and the tone of their
  voices Tarzan judged that the matter was serious and that it concerned him he
  was sure from the numerous glances that were cast in his direction. He could
  not know, though, that the subject of their discussion was based upon the
  report of the commander of the escort that their mighty guest was an eater of
  raw flesh and the consequent danger of bringing him among their
  people.</p><a id="pic15"

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">A consultation now took place.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The chief among them, the young commander, settled the question, however,
  by reminding them that though the giant must have been very hungry to have
  devoured as much flesh as they told him he had, nevertheless he had traveled
  for many hours with only a small number of their warriors always within easy
  reach of him and had not offered to molest them. This seemed a conclusive
  argument of his good intentions and consequently the cavalcade set forth
  without further delay in the direction of the hillocks that were now in plain
  view a mile or two away.</p>

  <p>As they neared them Tarzan saw what appeared to be literally innumerable
  little men moving about among the hillocks, and as he came nearer still he
  realized that these seeming hillocks were symmetrical mounds of small stones
  quite evidently built by the pygmies themselves and that the hordes of
  pygmies moving about among them were workers, for here was a long line all
  moving in one direction, emerging from a hole in the ground and following a
  well-defined path to a half-completed hillock that was evidently in course of
  construction. Another line moved, empty-handed, in the opposite direction,
  entering the ground through a second hole, and upon the flanks of each line
  and at frequent intervals, marched armed warriors, while other similar lines
  of guarded workers moved in and out of openings in each of the other domelike
  structures, carrying to the mind of the ape-man a suggestion of ants laboring
  about their hills.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SKA, the vulture, winged his way leisurely in great circles
  far above the right bank of the Ugogo. The pendant locket, sparkling in the
  sun light, had ceased to annoy him while on the wing, only when he alighted
  and walked upon the ground did it become an encumbrance; then he stepped upon
  it and tripped, but long since had he ceased to fight it, accepting it now as
  an inescapable evil. Beneath him he presently descried the still, recumbent
  form of Gorgo, the buffalo, whose posture proclaimed that he was already fit
  food for Ska. The great bird dropped, alighting in a nearby tree. All was
  well, no foes were in evidence. Satisfied of this, Ska flapped down to the
  fallen beast.</p>

  <p><br>
  MILES away a giant white man crouched in the concealment of a dense thicket
  with a little black girl. The fingers of one of the man's hands were across
  her mouth, those of the other held a knife at her heart. The man's eyes were
  not upon the girl, but were straining through the dense foliage toward a game
  trail along which two ebon warriors were advancing. Succor was close at hand
  for Uhha, the daughter of Khamis the witch doctor, for the two approaching
  were hunters from the village of Obebe, the chief; but she dared not call
  aloud to attract them lest the sharp point of Miranda's knife slip into her
  young heart, and so she heard them come and go until, their voices lost in
  the distance, the Spaniard arose and dragged her back upon the trail, where
  they took up, what seemed to Uhha, their endless and fruitless wanderings
  through the jungle.</p>

  <p><br>
  IN the village of the ant men Tarzan found a warm welcome and having decided
  to remain for a while that he might study them and their customs he set to
  work, as was his wont when thrown among strange peoples, to learn their
  language as quickly as possible. Having already mastered several languages
  and numerous dialects the ape-man never found it difficult to add to his
  linguistic attainments, and so it was only a matter of a comparatively short
  time before he found it possible to understand his hosts and to make himself
  understood by them. It was then that he learned that they had at first
  thought that he was some form of Alalus and had consequently believed that it
  ever would be impossible to communicate with him by other means than signs.
  They were greatly delighted therefore when it had become apparent that he
  could utter vocal sounds identical to theirs, and when they comprehended that
  he desired to learn their tongue, Adendrohahkis, the king, placed several
  instructors at his disposal and gave orders that all his people, with whom
  the giant stranger might come in contact, should aid him to an early
  understanding of their language.</p>

  <p>Adendrohahkis was particularly well inclined toward the ape-man because of
  the fact that it had been the king's son, Komodoflorensal, whom Tarzan had
  rescued from the clutches of the Alalus woman, and so it was that everything
  was done to make the giant's stay among them a pleasant one. A hundred slaves
  brought his food to him where he had taken up his abode beneath the shade of
  a great tree that grew in lonely majesty just outside the city. When he
  walked among the group of dome-houses a troop of cavalry galloped ahead to
  clear a path for him, lest he trod upon some of the people of the city; but
  always was Tarzan careful of his hosts, so that no harm ever befell one of
  them because of him.</p>

  <p>As he mastered the language he learned many things concerning these
  remarkable people. Prince Komodoflorensal almost daily took it upon himself
  to assist in the instruction of his colossal guest and it was from him that
  Tarzan learned most. Nor were his eyes idle as he strolled around the city.
  Particularly interesting was the method of construction used in erecting the
  comparatively gigantic dome-houses which towered high above even the great
  Tarzan. The first step in the construction was to outline the periphery of
  the base with boulders of uniform size and weighing, perhaps, fifty pounds
  each. Two slaves easily carried such a boulder when it was slung in a rope
  hammock and as thousands of slaves were employed the work progressed with
  rapidity. The circular base, with a diameter of one hundred and fifty to two
  hundred feet, having been outlined, another, smaller circle was laid about
  ten feet inside the first, four openings being left in each circle to mark
  the location of the four entrances to the completed building and
  corresponding to the four principal cardinal points of the compass. The walls
  of the entrances were then outlined upon the ground with similar large
  boulders, these being a little more carefully selected for uniformity, after
  which the four enclosures thus formed were packed closely with boulders. The
  corridors and chambers of the first floor were then outlined and the spaces
  between filled with boulders, each being placed with the utmost care and
  nicety in relation to those touching it and those that should rest upon it
  when the second course was laid, for these were to support a tremendous
  weight when the edifice was completed. The corridors were generally three
  feet wide, the equivalent of twelve feet by our standards, while the
  chambers, varied in dimensions according to the uses to which they were to be
  put. In the exact center of the building a circular opening was left that
  measured ten feet in diameter and this was carried upward as the building
  progressed until the whole formed an open shaft from ground floor to roof in
  the completed edifice.</p>

  <p>The lower course having been built up in this manner to a height of six
  inches wooden arches were placed at intervals the lengths of the corridors
  which were now ceiled over by the simple expedient of fastening thin wooden
  strips lengthways of the corridors from arch to arch until the corridors were
  entirely roofed. The strips, or boards, which overlapped one another, were
  fastened in place by wooden dowels driven through them into the peripheries
  of the arches. As this work was progressing the walls of the various chambers
  and the outer wall of the building were raised to a height of twenty-four
  inches, bringing them to the level of the ceilings of the arched corridors,
  and the spaces between chambers and corridors were packed with boulders, the
  interstices between which were filled with smaller stones and gravel. The
  ceiling beams were then placed across the other chambers, timbers six inches
  square hewn from a hard, tough wood being used, and in the larger chambers
  these were further supported, at intervals, by columns of the same dimensions
  and material. The ceiling beams being in place they were covered over with
  tight-fitting boards, doweled to place. The ceilings of the chambers now
  projected six inches above the surrounding course of the structure, and at
  this juncture hundreds of cauldrons were brought in which a crude asphalt was
  heated until it became liquid and the interstices of the next six inch course
  were filled with it, bringing the entire completed course to the same level
  at a height of thirty inches, over all of which a second six inch course of
  rock and asphalt was laid, and the second story laid out and completed in a
  similar manner.</p>

  <p>The palace of Adendrohahkis, constructed in this way, was two hundred
  twenty feet in diameter, and one hundred ten feet high, with thirty-six
  floors capable of housing eighty thousand people, a veritable anthill of
  humanity. The city consisted of ten similar domes, though each slightly
  smaller than the king's, housing a total of five hundred thousand people,
  two-thirds of whom were slaves; these being for the most part the artisans
  and body servants of the ruling class. Another half million slaves, the
  unskilled laborers of the city, dwelt in the subterranean chambers of the
  quarries from which the building material was obtained. The passageways and
  chambers of these mines were carefully shored and timbered as the work
  progressed, resulting in fairly commodious and comfortable quarters for the
  slaves upon the upper levels at least, and as the city was built upon the
  surface of an ancient ground moraine, on account of the accessibility of
  building material, the drainage was perfect, the slaves suffering no
  inconvenience because of their underground quarters.</p>

  <p>The domes themselves were well ventilated through the large central air
  shaft and the numerous windows that pierced the outer walls at frequent
  intervals at each level above the ground floor, in which, as previously
  explained, there were but four openings. The windows, which were six and
  one-quarter inches wide by eighteen and a half inches high, admitted a
  certain amount of light as well as air; but the interior of the dome,
  especially the gloomy chambers midway between the windows and the central
  light and air shaft, was illuminated by immense, slow-burning, smokeless
  candles.</p>

  <p>Tarzan watched the construction of the new dome with keenest interest,
  realizing that it was the only opportunity that he ever would have to see the
  interior of one of these remarkable, human hives, and as he was thus engaged
  Komodoflorensal and his friends hastened to initiate him into the mysteries
  of their language; and while he learned the language of his hosts he learned
  many other things of interest about them. The slaves, he discovered, were
  either prisoners of war or the descendants of prisoners of war. Some had been
  in bondage for so many generations that all trace of their origin had become
  lost and they considered themselves as much citizens of Trohanadalmakus, the
  city of King Adendrohahkis, as did any of the nobility. On the whole they
  were treated with kindness and were not overworked after the second
  generation. The recent prisoners and their children were, for the most part,
  included in the caste of unskilled labor from which the limit of human
  endurance was exacted. They were the miners, the quarriers and the builders
  and fully fifty per cent of them were literally worked to death. With the
  second generation the education of the children commenced, those who showed
  aptitude for any of the skilled crafts being immediately transferred from the
  quarries to the domes, where they took up the relatively easy life of a
  prosperous and indulged middle class. In another manner might an individual
  escape the quarries&mdash;by marriage, or rather by selection as they choose
  to call it, with a member of the ruling class. In a community where class
  consciousness was such a characteristic of the people and where caste was
  almost a fetish it was rather remarkable that such connections brought no
  odium upon the inferiors, but, on the contrary, automatically elevated the
  lesser to the caste of the higher contracting party.</p>

  <p>"It is thus, Deliverer of the Son of Adendrohahkis," explained
  Komodoflorensal, in reply to Tarzan's inquiry relative to this rather
  peculiar exception to the rigid class distinctions the king's son had so
  often impressed upon him: "Ages ago, during the reign of Klamataamorosal in
  the city of Trohanadalmakus, the warriors of Veltopishago, king of the city
  of Veltopismakus, marched upon our fair Trohanadalmakus and in the battle
  that ensued the troops of our ancestors were all but annihilated. Thousands
  of our men and women were carried away into slavery and all that saved us
  from being totally wiped out was the courageous defense that our own slaves
  waged for their masters. Klamataamorosal, from whom I am descended, fighting
  in the thick of the fray noted the greater stamina of the slaves; they were
  stronger than the warriors of either city and seemed not to tire at all,
  while the high caste nobility of the fighting clans, though highly
  courageous, became completely exhausted after a few minutes of fighting.</p>

  <p>"After the battle was over Klamataamorosal called together all the chief
  officers of the city, or rather all who had not been killed or taken
  prisoner, and pointed out to them that the reason our city had been defeated
  was not so much because of the greater numbers of the forces of the king
  Veltopishago as due to the fact that our own warriors were physical
  weaklings, and he asked them why this should be and what could be done to
  remedy so grievous a fault. The youngest man among them, wounded and weak
  from loss of blood, was the only one who could offer a reasonable
  explanation, or suggest a means of correcting the one obvious weakness of the
  city.</p>

  <p>"He called their attention to the fact that of all the race of Minunians
  the people of the city of Trohanadalmakus were the most ancient and that for
  ages there had been no infusion of new blood, since they were not permitted
  to mate outside their own caste, while their slaves, recruited from all the
  cities of Minuni, had interbred, with the result that they had become strong
  and robust while their masters, through inbreeding, had grown correspondingly
  weaker.</p>

  <p>"He exhorted Klamataamorosal to issue a decree elevating to the warrior
  class any slave that was chosen as mate by either a man or woman of that
  class, and further to obligate each and every warrior to select at least one
  mate from among their slaves. At first, of course, the objections to so
  iconoclastic a suggestion were loud and bitter; but Klamataamorosal was quick
  to sense the wisdom of the idea and not only did he issue the decree, but he
  was the first to espouse a slave woman, and what the king did all were
  anxious to do also.</p>

  <p>"The very next generation showed the wisdom of the change and each
  succeeding generation has more than fulfilled the expectations of
  Klamataamorosal until now you see in the people of Trohanadalmakus the most
  powerful and warlike of the Minunians.</p>

  <p>"Our ancient enemy, Veltopismakus, was the next city to adopt the new
  order, having learned of it through slaves taken in raids upon our own
  community, but they were several generations behind us. Now all the cities of
  Minuni wed their warriors with their slave women. And why not? Our slaves
  were all descended from the warrior class of other cities from which their
  ancestors were captured. We all are of the same race, we all have the same
  language and in all important respects the same customs.</p>

  <p>"Time has made some slight changes in the manner of the selection of these
  new mates and now it is often customary to make war upon another city for the
  sole purpose of capturing their noblest born and most beautiful women.</p>

  <p>"For us of the royal family it has been nothing less than salvation from
  extinction. Our ancestors were transmitting disease and insanity to their
  progeny. The new, pure, virile blood of the slaves has washed the taint from
  our veins and so altered has our point of view become that whereas, in the
  past, the child of a slave woman and a warrior was without caste the lowest
  of the low, now they rank highest of the high, since it is considered immoral
  for one of the royal family to wed other than a slave."</p>

  <p>"And your wife?" asked Tarzan. "You took her in a battle with some other
  city?"</p>

  <p>"I have no wife," replied Komodoflorensal. "We are preparing now to make
  war upon Veltopismakus the daughter of whose king, we are told by slaves from
  that city, is the most beautiful creature in the world. Her name is Janzara,
  and as she is not related to me, except possibly very remotely, she is a fit
  mate for the son of Adendrohahkis."</p>

  <p>"How do you know she is not related to you?" asked the ape-man.</p>

  <p>"We keep as accurate a record of the royal families of Veltopismakus and
  several others of the nearer cities of Minuni as we do of our own," replied
  Komodoflorensal, "obtaining our information from captives, usually from those
  who are chosen in marriage by our own people. For several generations the
  kings of Veltopismakus have not been sufficiently powerful or fortunate to
  succeed in taking royal princesses from us by either force of arms or
  strategy, though they never have ceased attempting to do so, and the result
  has been that they have been forced to find their mates in other and
  oftentimes distant cities.</p>

  <p>"The present king of Veltopismakus, Elkomoelhago, the father of the
  princess Janzara, took his mate, the mother of the princess, from a far
  distant city that has never, within historic times, taken slaves from
  Trohanadalmakus, nor have our warriors visited that city within the memory of
  any living man. Janzara, therefore, should make me an excellent mate."</p>

  <p>"But what about love&mdash;suppose you should not care for one another?"
  asked Tarzan.</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal shrugged his shoulders. "She will bear me a son who will
  some day be king of Trohanadalmakus," he replied, "and that is all that can
  be asked."</p>

  <p>While the preparations for the expedition against Veltopismakus were being
  carried on Tarzan was left much to his own devices. The activities of these
  diminutive people were a never ending source of interest to him. He watched
  the endless lines of slaves struggling with their heavy burdens toward the
  new dome that was rising with almost miraculous speed, or he strolled to the
  farmlands just beyond the city where other slaves tilled the rich soil, which
  they scratched with tiny plows drawn by teams of diadets, the diminutive
  antelope that was their only beast of burden. Always were the slaves
  accompanied by armed warriors if they were slaves of the first or second
  generation, lest they should attempt escape or revolution, as well as a
  protection against beasts of prey and human enemies, since the slaves were
  not permitted to bear arms and, consequently, could not protect themselves.
  These slaves of the first and second generations were always easily
  recognizable by the vivid green tunic, reaching almost to the knees, which
  was the single garment of their caste, and which carried upon both its front
  and back an emblem or character in black that denoted the city of the slave's
  birth and the individual to whom he now belonged. The slaves employed upon
  public works all belonged to the king, Adendrohahkis, but in the fields many
  families were represented by their chattels.</p>

  <p>Moving about the city upon their various duties were thousands of
  white-tunicked slaves. They exercised the mounts of their masters, they
  oversaw much of the more menial and laborious work of the lower caste slaves,
  they plied their trades and sold their wares in perfect freedom; but like the
  other slaves they wore but a single garment, together with rough sandals
  which were common to both classes. On their breasts and backs in red were the
  emblems of their masters. The second generation slaves of the green tunics
  had a similar emblem, these having been born in the city and being
  consequently considered a part of it. There were other, though minor,
  distinguishing marks upon the tunics of the higher caste slaves; small
  insignia upon one shoulder or upon both, or upon a sleeve, denoting the
  occupation of the wearer. Groom, body servant, major-domo, cook, hairdresser,
  worker in gold and silver, potter&mdash;one could tell at a glance the
  vocation of each&mdash;and each belonged, body and soul, to his master, who
  was compelled to feed and dome these dependents, the fruits of whose labors
  belonged exclusively to him.</p>

  <p>The wealth of one warrior family might lie in the beauty and perfection of
  the gold and silver ornaments it sold to its wealthy fellows and in such an
  instance all its skilled slaves, other than those required for personal and
  household duties, would be employed in the designing and fabrication of these
  articles. Another family might devote its attention to agriculture, another
  to the raising of diadets; but all the work was done by the slaves, with the
  single exception of the breaking of the diadets that were bred for riding, an
  occupation that was not considered beneath the dignity of the warrior class,
  but rather, on the contrary, looked upon as a fitting occupation for nobles.
  Even the king's son broke his own diadets.</p>

  <p>As an interested spectator Tarzan whiled the lazy days away. To his
  repeated queries as to the possibility of a way out of this bizarre,
  thorn-infested world, his hosts replied that it was naught to penetrate the
  forest of thorn trees, but that as it continued indefinitely to the uttermost
  extremities of matter it was quite useless to attempt to penetrate it at all,
  their conception of the world being confined to what they actually had
  seen&mdash;a land of hills, valleys and forest, surrounded by thorn trees. To
  creatures of their size the thorn forest was far from impenetrable, but
  Tarzan was not their size. Still he never ceased to plan on a means of
  escape, though he was in no great haste to attempt it, since he found the
  Minunians interesting and it suited his present primitive mood to loll in
  lazy ease in the city of Trohanadalmakus.</p>

  <p>But of a sudden a change came, early of a morning, just as the first,
  faint promise of dawn was tinging the eastern sky.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE Alalus youth, son of The First Woman, ranged the forest
  in search of the ape-man, the only creature that ever had stirred within his
  savage, primitive breast any emotion even slightly akin to affection; but he
  did not find him. Instead he fell in with two older males of his own species,
  and these three hunted together, as was occasionally the custom of these
  inoffensive creatures. His new acquaintances showed little interest in his
  strange armament&mdash;they were quite content with a stick and a stone
  knife. To the former an occasional rodent fell and the latter discovered many
  a luscious grub and insect beneath the mold that floored the forest or hidden
  under the bark of a tree. For the most part, however, they fed upon fruits,
  nuts and tubers. Not so the son of The First Woman, however. He brought in
  many birds and an occasional antelope, for he was becoming daily more
  proficient with the bow and the spear, and as he often brought in more than
  he could eat and left the remainder to his two fellows, they were permanently
  attached to him, or at least until such time as some fearsome woman should
  appear upon the scene to shatter their idyllic existence and drag one of them
  away to her corral.</p>

  <p>They wondered a little at him in their slow and stupid minds, for he
  seemed to differ in some vague, intangible way from them and all others of
  their sex that they had known. He held his chin higher for one thing and his
  gaze was far less shifty and apologetic. He strode with a firmer step and
  with less caution; but perhaps they smiled inwardly as they cogitated muddily
  upon that inevitable moment that would discover one of their coarse, brutal,
  hairy shes felling him with her bludgeon and dragging him off toward the
  caves by the hair of his head.</p>

  <p>And then one day the thing happened, or at least a part of it
  happened&mdash;they met a huge she suddenly in an open place in the forest.
  The two who accompanied the son of The First Woman turned in flight, but when
  they had reached the vantage ground of close-growing timber they paused and
  looked back to see if the woman was pursuing them and what had become of
  their companion. To their relief they saw that the woman was not following
  them and to their consternation that their fellow had not fled, but was
  facing her defiantly, and motioning her to go away, or be killed. Such crass
  stupidity! He must have been whelped without brains. It never occurred to
  them to attribute his act to courage. Courage was for the shes; the male
  spent his life in fleeing danger and the female of his species.</p>

  <p>But they were grateful to him, for his rash act would save them since the
  she would take but one of them and that one would be he who thus foolishly
  remained behind to defy her.</p>

  <p>The woman, unaccustomed to having her rights challenged by mere man, was
  filled with surprise and righteous anger. Her surprise brought her to a
  sudden halt twenty paces from the man and her anger caused her to reach for
  one of the stone missiles hanging at her girdle. That was her undoing. The
  son of The First Woman, standing before her with an arrow already fitted to
  his bow, waited not to discover her further intentions, but even as the
  woman's fingers loosed the feathered messenger of defeat from the leather
  thong of her girdle, he drew the shaft to his cheek and released it.</p>

  <p>His two companions, watching from the seclusion of the wood, saw the woman
  stiffen, her face contorted in a spasm of pain; they saw her clutch
  frantically at a feathered shaft protruding from her chest, sink to her knees
  and then sprawl to earth, where she lay kicking with her feet and clutching
  with her fingers for a brief moment before she relapsed into eternal quiet;
  then they emerged from their concealment, and as the son of The First Woman
  approached his victim and wrenched the arrow from her heart they joined him,
  half-stunned as they were by surprise, and gazed first at the corpse of the
  she with expressions of incredulity and then at him with what was closely
  akin to awe and reverence.</p>

  <p>They examined his bow and arrows and again and again they returned to the
  wound in the woman's chest. It was all quite too amazing. And the son of The
  First Woman? He held his head high and his chest out and strutted proudly.
  Never before had he or any other man been cast in the role of hero and he
  enjoyed it. But he would impress them further. Seizing the corpse of the
  woman he dragged it to a nearby tree where he propped it in a sitting posture
  against the bole; then he walked away some twenty feet and, signing his
  fellows to observe him closely, he raised his heavy spear and hurled it at
  his realistic target, through which it passed to embed itself in the tree
  behind.</p>

  <p>The others were greatly excited. One of them wanted to attempt this
  wondrous feat and when he had thrown, and missed, his fellow insisted upon
  having a turn. Later they craved practice with the bow and arrow. For hours
  the three remained before their grisly target, nor did they desist until
  hunger prompted them to move on and the son of The First Woman had promised
  to show them how to fashion weapons similar to his own&mdash;a momentous
  occurrence in the history of the Alali, though these three sensed it as
  little as did the hundreds of Alalus women repairing to their caves that
  night in blissful ignorance of the blow that had been struck at their
  supremacy by the militant suffragists of Minuni.</p>

  <p><br>
  AND as suddenly, with more immediate results, the even tenor of Tarzan's
  existence in the city of Trohanadalmakus was altered and a series of events
  initiated that were to lead to the maddest and most unbelievable
  denouement.</p>

  <p>The ape-man lay upon a bed of grasses beneath a great tree that grew
  beside the city of King Adendrohahkis. Dawn was flushing the sky above the
  forest to the east of Trohanadalmakus, when Tarzan, his ear close to the
  ground, was suddenly awakened by a strange reverberation that seemed to come
  faintly from the bowels of the earth. It was such a dim and distant sound
  that it would scarce have been appreciable to you or to me had we placed an
  ear flat against the ground after having been told that the noise existed;
  but to Tarzan it was an interruption of the ordinary noises of the night and,
  therefore, however slight, of sufficient import to impinge upon his
  consciousness even in sleep.</p>

  <p>Awakened, he still lay listening intently. He knew that the sound did not
  come from the bowels of the earth, but from the surface and he guessed that
  it originated at no great distance, and also, he knew, that it was coming
  closer rapidly. For just a moment it puzzled him and then a great light
  dawned upon him and he sprang to his feet. The dome of the king,
  Adendrohahkis, lay a hundred yards away and toward it he bent his steps. Just
  before the south entrance he was challenged by a tiny sentinel.</p>

  <p>"Take word to your king," the ape-man directed him, "that Tarzan hears
  many diadets galloping toward Trohanadalmakus and that unless he is much
  mistaken each carries a hostile warrior upon its back."</p>

  <p>The sentinel turned and hallooed down the corridor leading from the
  entrance, and a moment later an officer and several other warriors appeared.
  At sight of Tarzan they halted.</p>

  <p>"What is wrong?" demanded the officer.</p>

  <p>"The King's Guest says that he heard many diadets approaching," replied
  the sentinel.</p>

  <p>"From what direction?" demanded the officer, addressing Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"From that direction the sounds appeared to come," replied the ape-man,
  pointing toward the west.</p>

  <p>"The Veltopismakusians!" exclaimed the officer, and then, turning to those
  who had accompanied him from the interior of the king's dome: "Quick! arouse
  Trohanadalmakus&mdash;I will warn the king's dome and the king," and he
  wheeled and ran quickly within, while the others sped away to awaken the
  city.</p>

  <p>In an incredibly short space of time Tarzan saw thousands of warriors
  streaming from each of the ten domes. From the north and the south doors of
  each dome rode mounted men, and from the east and west marched the foot
  soldiers. There was no confusion; everything moved with military precision
  and evidently in accordance with a plan of defense in which each unit had
  been thoroughly drilled.</p>

  <p>Small detachments of cavalry galloped quickly to the four points of the
  compass&mdash;these were scouts each detail of which spread fan wise just
  beyond the limits of the domes until the city was encircled by a thin line of
  mounted men that would halt when it had reached a predetermined distance from
  the city, and fall back with information before an advancing enemy. Following
  these, stronger detachments of mounted men moved out to north and south and
  east and west to take positions just inside the line of scouts. These
  detachments were strong enough to engage the enemy and impede his progress as
  they fell back upon the main body of the cavalry which might by this plan be
  summoned in time to the point at which the enemy was making his boldest
  effort to reach the city.</p>

  <p>And then the main body of the cavalry moved out, and in this instance
  toward the west, from which point they were already assured the foe was
  approaching; while the infantry, which had not paused since it emerged from
  the domes, marched likewise toward the four points of the compass in four
  compact bodies of which by far the largest moved toward the west. The advance
  foot troops took their stations but a short distance outside the city, while
  within the area of the domes the last troops to emerge from them, both
  cavalry and infantry, remained evidently as a reserve force, and it was with
  these troops that Adendrohahkis took his post that he might be centrally
  located for the purpose of directing the defense of his city to better
  advantage.</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal, the prince, had gone out in command of the main body of
  cavalry that was to make the first determined stand against the oncoming foe.
  This body consisted of seven thousand five hundred men and its position lay
  two miles outside the city, half a mile behind a cavalry patrol of five
  hundred men, of which there were four, one at each point of the compass, and
  totaling two thousand men. The balance of the ten thousand advance troops
  consisted of the five hundred mounted scouts or vedettes who, in turn, were
  half a mile in advance of the picket patrols, at two hundred foot intervals,
  entirely surrounding the city at a distance of three miles. Inside the city
  fifteen thousand mounted men were held in reserve.</p>

  <p>In the increasing light of dawn Tarzan watched these methodical
  preparations for defense with growing admiration for the tiny Minunians.
  There was no shouting and no singing, but on the face of every warrior who
  passed close enough for the ape-man to discern his features was an expression
  of exalted rapture. No need here for war cries or battle hymns to bolster the
  questionable courage of the weak&mdash;there were no weak.</p>

  <p>The pounding of the hoofs of the advancing Veltopismakusian horde had
  ceased. It was evident that their scouts had discovered that the intended
  surprise had failed. Were they altering the plan or point of attack, or had
  they merely halted the main body temporarily to await the result of a
  reconnaissance? Tarzan asked a nearby officer if, perchance, the enemy had
  abandoned his intention of attacking at all. The man smiled and shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"Minunians never abandon an attack," he said.</p>

  <p>As Tarzan's eyes wandered over the city's ten domes, illuminated now by
  the rays of the rising sun, he saw in each of the numerous window embrasures,
  that pierced the domes at regular intervals at each of their thirty odd
  floors, a warrior stationed at whose side lay a great bundle of short
  javelins, while just to his rear was piled a quantity of small, round stones.
  The ape-man smiled.</p>

  <p>"They overlook no possible contingency," he thought. "But the quarry
  slaves! what of them? Would they not turn against their masters at the first
  opportunity for escape that an impending battle such as this would be almost
  certain to present to them?" He turned again to the officer and put the
  question to him.</p>

  <p>The latter turned and pointed toward the entrance to the nearest quarry,
  where Tarzan saw hundreds of white-tunicked slaves piling rocks upon it while
  a detachment of infantry leaned idly upon their spears as their officers
  directed the labor of the slaves.</p>

  <p>"There is another detachment of warriors bottled up inside the quarry
  entrance," explained the officer to Tarzan. "If the enemy gains the city and
  this outer guard is driven into the domes or killed or captured, the inner
  guard can hold off an entire army, as only one man can attack them at a time.
  Our slaves are safe, therefore, unless the city falls and that has not
  happened to any Minunian city within the memory of man. The best that the
  Veltopismakusians can hope for now is to pick up a few prisoners, but they
  will doubtless leave behind as many as they take. Had their surprise been
  successful they might have forced their way into one of the domes and made
  away with many women and much loot. Now, though, our forces are too well
  disposed to make it possible for any but a greatly superior force to
  seriously threaten the city itself. I even doubt if our infantry will be
  engaged at all."</p>

  <p>"How is the infantry disposed?" asked Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"Five thousand men are stationed within the windows of the domes," replied
  the officer; "five thousand more comprise the reserve which you see about
  you, and from which detachments have been detailed to guard the quarries. A
  mile from the city are four other bodies of infantry; those to the east,
  north and south having a strength of one thousand men each, while the one to
  the west, facing the probable point of attack, consists of seven thousand
  warriors."</p>

  <p>"Then you think the fighting will not reach the city?" asked Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"No. The lucky men today are in the advance cavalry&mdash;they will get
  whatever fighting there is. I doubt if an infantryman draws a sword or casts
  a spear; but that is usually the case&mdash;it is the cavalry that fights,
  always."</p>

  <p>"I take it that you feel unfortunate in not being attached to a cavalry
  unit. Could you not be transferred?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, we must all take our turns of duty in each branch," explained the
  officer. "We are all mounted except for defense of the city and for that
  purpose we are assigned to the foot troops for four moons, followed by five
  moons in the cavalry"&mdash;the word he used was <i>diadetax</i>&mdash;"five
  thousand men being transferred from one to the other the night of each new
  moon."</p>

  <p>Tarzan turned and looked out across the plain toward the west. He could
  see the nearer troops standing at ease, awaiting the enemy. Even the main
  body of cavalry, two miles away, he could discern, because there were so many
  of them; but the distant pickets and vedettes were invisible. As he stood
  leaning upon his spear watching this scene, a scene such as no other man of
  his race ever had witnessed, and realized the seriousness of these little men
  in the business of war that confronted them, he could not but think of the
  people of his own world lining up their soldiers for purposes usually far
  less momentous to them than the call to arms that had brought the tough
  little warriors of Adendrohahkis swarming from their pallets in the defense
  of home and city.</p><a id="pic16"

    <p class="caption">He could see the nearer troops standing at ease,
    awaiting the enemy.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>No chicanery of politics here, no thinly veiled ambition of some potential
  tyrant, no mad conception of harebrained dreamers seized by the avaricious
  criminal for self-aggrandizement and riches; none of these, but patriotism of
  purest strain energized by the powerful urge of self-preservation. The
  perfect fighters, the perfect warriors, the perfect heroes these. No need for
  blaring trumpets; of no use to them the artificial aids to courage conceived
  by captains of the outer world who send unwilling men to battle for they know
  not what, deceived by lying propaganda, enraged by false tales of the
  barbarity of the foe, whose anger has been aroused against them by similar
  means.</p>

  <p>During the lull that followed the departure from the city of the last of
  the advance troops Tarzan approached Adendrohahkis where he sat astride his
  diadet surrounded by a number of his high officers. The king was resplendent
  in golden jerkin, a leathern garment upon which small discs of gold were
  sewn, overlapping one another. About his waist was a wide belt of heavy
  leather, held in place by three buckles of gold, and of such dimensions as to
  have almost the appearance of a corset. This belt supported his rapier and
  knife, the scabbards of which were heavily inlaid with gold and baser metals
  in intricate and beautiful designs. Leather cuisses protected his upper legs
  in front covering the thighs to the knees, while his forearms were encased in
  metal armlets from wrists almost to elbows. Upon his feet were strapped tough
  sandals, with a circular golden plate protecting each ankle-bone. A
  well-shaped leather casque fitted his head closely.</p>

  <p>As Tarzan stopped before him the king recognized the ape-man with a
  pleasant greeting. "The captain of the guard reports that it is to you we owe
  the first warning of the coming of the Veltopismakusians. Once again have you
  placed the people of Trohanadalmakus under deep obligations. However are we
  to repay our debt?"</p>

  <p>Tarzan gestured deprecatively. "You owe me nothing, King of
  Trohanadalmakus," he replied. "Give me your friendship and tell me that I may
  go forward and join your noble son, the prince: then all the obligations
  shall be upon my head."</p>

  <p>"Until the worms of death devour me I shall be your friend always,
  Tarzan," returned the king graciously. "Go where you will and that you choose
  to go where there should be fighting surprises me not."</p>

  <p>It was the first time that any Minunian had addressed him by his name.
  Always had he been called Saviour of the Prince, Guest of the King, Giant of
  the Forest and by other similar impersonal appellations. Among the Minunians
  a man's name is considered a sacred possession, the use of which is permitted
  only his chosen friends and the members of his family, and to be called
  Tarzan by Adendrohahkis was equivalent to an invitation, or a command, to the
  closest personal friendship with the king.</p>

  <p>The ape-man acknowledged the courtesy with a bow. "The friendship of
  Adendrohahkis is a sacred honor, ennobling those who wear it. I shall guard
  it always with my life, as my most treasured possession," he said in a low
  voice; nor was the Lord of the Jungle moved by any maudlin sentimentality as
  he addressed the king. For these little people he had long since acknowledged
  to himself a keen admiration and for the personal character of Adendrohahkis
  he had come to have the most profound respect. Never since he had learned
  their language had he ceased his inquiries concerning the manners and the
  customs of these people, and he had found the personality of Adendrohahkis so
  inextricably interwoven with the lives of his subjects that in receiving the
  answers to his questions he could not but absorb unquestionable evidence of
  the glories of the king's character.</p>

  <p>Adendrohahkis seemed pleased with his words, which he acknowledged
  graciously, and then the ape-man withdrew and started toward the front. On
  the way he tore a leafy branch from a tree that grew beside his path for the
  thought had occurred to him that such a weapon might be useful against
  Minunians and he knew not what the day might hold.</p>

  <p>He had just passed the advanced infantry when a courier sped by him on a
  mad race toward the city. Tarzan strained his eyes ahead, but he could see no
  sign of battle and when he reached the main cavalry advance there was still
  no indication of an enemy as far ahead as he could see.</p>

  <p>Prince Komodoflorensal greeted him warmly and looked a little wonderingly,
  perhaps, at the leafy branch he carried across one shoulder.</p>

  <p>"What news?" asked Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"I have just sent a messenger to the king," replied the prince, "reporting
  that our scouts have come in touch with those of the enemy, who are, as we
  thought, the Veltopismakusians. A strong patrol from the outpost in our front
  pushed through the enemy's scout line and one courageous warrior even managed
  to penetrate as far as the summit of the Hill of Gartolas, from which he saw
  the entire main body of the enemy forming for attack. He says there are
  between twenty and thirty thousand of them."</p>

  <p>As Komodoflorensal ceased speaking, a wave of sound came rolling toward
  them from the west.</p>

  <p>"They are coming!" announced the prince.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SKA, perched upon the horn of dead Gorgo, became suddenly
  aware of a movement in a nearby thicket. He turned his head in the direction
  of the sound and saw Sabor the lioness emerge from the foliage and walk
  slowly toward him. Ska was not terrified. He would leave, but he would leave
  with dignity. He crouched to spring upward, and extended his great wings to
  aid him in taking off. But Ska, the vulture, never rose. As he essayed to do
  so, something pulled suddenly upon his neck and held him down. He scrambled
  to his feet and, violently this time, strove to fly away. Again he was
  dragged back. Now Ska was terrified. The hateful thing that had been dangling
  about his neck for so long was holding him to earth&mdash;the swinging loop
  of the golden chain had caught around the horn of Gorgo, the buffalo. Ska was
  trapped.</p>

  <p>He struggled, beating his wings. Sabor stopped to regard him and his
  wild antics. Ska was flopping around in a most surprising manner. Sabor had
  never seen Ska behave thus before, and lions are sensitive, temperamental
  animals; so Sabor was not surprised only, she was inclined to be frightened.
  For another moment she watched the unaccountable antics of Ska and then she
  turned tail and slunk back into the undergrowth, turning an occasional
  growling countenance back upon the vulture, as much as to say; "Pursue me at
  your peril!" But Ska had no thought of pursuing Sabor. Never again would Ska,
  the vulture, pursue aught.</p>

  <p><br>
  "THEY are coming!" announced Komodoflorensal, prince of Trohanadalmakus.</p>

  <p>As Tarzan looked out across the rolling country in the direction of the
  enemy, he presently saw, from his greater height, the advance of the
  Veltopismakusians.</p>

  <p>"Our scouts are falling back," he announced to Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"You can see the enemy?" demanded the prince.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Keep me advised as to their movements."</p>

  <p>"They are advancing in several long lines, deployed over a considerable
  front," reported the ape-man. "The scouts are falling back upon the outpost
  which seems to be standing its ground to receive them. It will be
  overwhelmed&mdash;if not by the first line then by those that succeed
  it."</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal gave a short command. A thousand mounted men leaped
  forward, urging their diadets into bounding leaps that cleared five, six and
  even seven feet at a time. Straight for the outpost ahead of them they raced,
  deploying as they went.</p>

  <p>Another thousand moved quickly toward the right and a third toward the
  left of the advance cavalry's position following Tarzan's announcement that
  the enemy had divided into two bodies just before it engaged the outpost, and
  that one of these was moving as though with the intention of turning the
  right flank of the main cavalry of Trohanadalmakus, while the other circled
  in the direction of the left flank.</p><a id="pic17"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">Another thousand moved quickly toward the right.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"They are striking boldly and quickly for prisoners," said the prince to
  Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"Their second and third lines are ploying upon the center and moving
  straight for us," said Tarzan. "They have reached the outpost, which is
  racing forward with them, giving battle vigorously with rapiers."</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal was dispatching messengers toward the rear. "It is thus
  that we fight," he said, evidently in explanation of the action of the
  outpost "It is time that you returned to the rear, for in another few moments
  you will be surrounded by the enemy if you remain. When they reach us we,
  too, will turn and fight them hand-to-hand back toward the city. If it still
  is their intention to enter the city the battle will resemble more a race
  than aught else, for the speed will be too great for effective fighting; but
  if they have abandoned that idea and intend contenting themselves with
  prisoners there will be plenty of fighting before we reach the infantry, past
  which I doubt if they will advance.</p>

  <p>"With their greatly superior numbers they will take some prisoners, and we
  shall take some&mdash;but, quick! you must get back to the city, if already
  it is not too late."</p>

  <p>"I think I shall remain here," replied the ape-man.</p>

  <p>"But they will take you prisoner, or kill you."</p>

  <p>Tarzan of the Apes smiled and shook his leafy branch. "I do not fear
  them," he said, simply.</p>

  <p>"That is because you do not know them," replied the prince. "Your great
  size makes you overconfident, but remember that you are only four times the
  size of a Minunian and there may be thirty thousand seeking to overthrow
  you."</p>

  <p>The Veltopismakusians were driving swiftly forward. The prince could give
  no more time to what he saw was but a futile attempt to persuade Tarzan to
  retreat, and while he admired the strange giant's courage he likewise
  deplored his ignorance. Komodoflorensal had grown fond of their strange guest
  and he would have saved him had it been possible, but now he must turn to the
  command of his troops, since the enemy was almost upon them.</p>

  <p>Tarzan watched the coming of the little men on their agile, wiry mounts.
  Line after line poured across the rolling country toward him, carrying to his
  mind a suggestion of their similarity to the incoming rollers of the ocean's
  surf, each drop of which was soft and harmless, but in their countless
  numbers combined into a relentless and terrifying force of destruction, and
  the ape-man glanced at his leafy bough and smiled, albeit a trifle
  ruefully.</p>

  <p>But now his whole attention was riveted by the fighting in the first two
  lines of the advancing horde. Racing neck and neck with the Veltopismakusian
  warriors were the men of Adendrohahkis' outpost and the thousands who had
  reinforced them. Each had selected an enemy rider whom he sought to strike
  from his saddle, and at top speed each duel was carried on with keen rapiers,
  though here and there was a man wielding his spear, and sometimes to good
  effect. A few riderless diadets leaped forward with the vanguard, while
  others, seeking to break back or to the flanks, fouled the racing ranks,
  often throwing beasts and riders to the ground; but more frequently the
  warriors leaped their mounts entirely over these terrified beasts. The riding
  of the Minunians was superb, and their apparently effortless control of their
  swift and nervous steeds bordered upon the miraculous. Now a warrior, lifting
  his mount high into the air, cleared an adversary and as he rose above him
  cut down viciously with his rapier at his foeman's head, striking him from
  the saddle; but there was scarce time to catch more than a fleeting,
  kaleidoscopic impression of the swift-moving spectacle before the great horde
  swarmed down upon him.</p>

  <p>With his leafy bough, Tarzan had thought to sweep the little men from his
  path, but now friend and foe were so intermingled that he dared not attempt
  it for fear of unseating and injuring some of the warriors of his hosts. He
  raised the bough above their heads and waited until the first lines should
  have passed him and then, with only the enemies of Adendrohahkis about him,
  he would brush them aside and break the center of their charge.</p>

  <p>He saw the surprised expressions upon the faces of the men of
  Veltopismakus as they passed near him&mdash;surprise, but no fear&mdash;and
  he heard their shouts as one more fortunate than his fellows was able to rein
  closer to him and cut viciously at his legs as he sped past. Then indeed it
  became naught other than a matter of self-preservation to attempt to fend
  these off with his bough, nor was this impossible as the first lines moved
  past in loose ranks; but presently the solid mass of the Veltopismakusian
  cavalry was upon him. There was no veering aside to avoid him. In unbroken
  ranks, file after file, they bore down upon him. He threw his useless bough
  before him to impede their progress and grappled them with his fingers,
  tearing the riders from their mounts and hurling them back upon their
  onrushing fellows; but still they came.</p>

  <p>They jumped their diadets over every obstruction. One rider, leaping
  straight for him, struck him head on in the pit of the stomach, half winding
  him and sending him back a step. Another and another struck his legs and
  sides. Again and again the needlelike points of their rapiers pierced his
  brown hide until from hips to feet he was red with his own blood, and always
  there were more thousands bearing down upon him. His weapons, useless against
  them, he made no attempt to use and though he wrought havoc among them with
  his bare hands there were always a hundred to take the place of each that he
  disposed of.</p>

  <p>He smiled grimly as he realized that in these little people, scarce
  one-fourth his size, he, the incomparable Tarzan, the Lord of the Jungle, had
  met his Wellington. He realized that he was entirely surrounded by the
  Veltopismakusians now, the warriors of Trohanadalmakus having engaged the
  advancing enemy were racing onward with them toward the seven thousand
  dismounted men who were to receive the brunt of that terrific charge. Tarzan
  wished that he might have witnessed this phase of the battle, but he had
  fighting enough and to spare to engage all his attention where he was.</p>

  <p>Again he was struck in the stomach by a charging rider and again the blow
  staggered him. Before he could recover himself another struck him in the same
  place and this time he went down, and instantly he was covered, buried by
  warriors and diadets, swarming over him, like ants, in countless numbers. He
  tried to rise and that was the last he remembered before he sank into
  unconsciousness.</p>

  <p><br>
  UHHA, daughter of Khamis the witch doctor of the tribe of Obebe the cannibal,
  lay huddled upon a little pile of grasses in a rude thorn shelter in an open
  jungle. It was night but she was not asleep. Through narrowed lids she
  watched a giant white man who squatted just outside the shelter before a tiny
  fire. The girl's lids were narrowed in hate as her smoldering eyes rested
  upon the man. There was no fear of the supernatural in her
  expression&mdash;just hate, undying hate.</p>

  <p>Long since had Uhha ceased to think of Esteban Miranda as The River Devil.
  His obvious fear of the greater beasts of the jungle and of the black
  men-beasts had at first puzzled and later assured her that her companion was
  an impostor; River Devils do not fear anything. She was even commencing to
  doubt that the fellow was Tarzan, of whom she had heard so many fabulous
  stories during her childhood that she had come to look upon him as almost a
  devil himself&mdash;her people had no gods, only devils&mdash;which answer
  just as good a purpose among the ignorant and superstitious as do gods among
  the educated and superstitious.</p>

  <p>And when Esteban Miranda quite conclusively proved by his actions that he
  feared lions and that he was lost in the jungle these things did not square
  at all with her preconceived estimate of the powers and attributes of the
  famous Tarzan.</p>

  <p>With the loss of her respect for him she lost, also, nearly all her fear.
  He was stronger than she and brutal. He could and would hurt her if she
  angered him, but he could not harm her in any other way than physically and
  not at all if she could keep out of his clutches. Many times had she
  rehearsed plans for escape, but always she had hesitated because of the
  terrible fear she had of being alone in the jungle. Recently, however, she
  had been coming to realize more and more clearly that the white man was
  little or no protection to her. In fact, she might be better off without him,
  for at the first hint of danger it had been Miranda's habit to bolt for the
  nearest tree, and where trees were not numerous this habit of his had always
  placed Uhha under a handicap in the race for self-preservation, since
  Esteban, being stronger, could push her aside if she impeded his progress
  towards safety.</p>

  <p>Yes, she would be as well off alone in the jungle as in the company of
  this man whom she thoroughly despised and hated, but before she left him she
  must, her savage little brain assured her, revenge herself upon him for
  having tricked her into aiding him in his escape from the village of Obebe
  the chief as well as for having forced her to accompany him.</p>

  <p>Uhha was sure that she could find her way to the village, albeit they had
  traveled long and far, and she was sure too that she could find the means for
  subsistence along the way and elude the fiercer beasts of prey that might
  beset the way. Only man she feared; but in this she was not unlike all other
  created things. Man alone of all the creations of God is universally hunted
  and feared and not only by the lower orders but by his own kind, for of them
  all man alone joys in the death of others&mdash;the great coward who, of all
  creation, fears death the most.</p>

  <p>And so the little Negro girl lay watching the Spaniard and her eyes
  glittered, for in his occupation she saw a means to her revenge. Squatting
  before his fire, leaning far forward, Esteban Miranda gloated over the
  contents of a small buckskin bag which he had partially emptied into the palm
  of one of his hands. Little Uhha knew how highly the white man prized these
  glittering stones, though she was entirely ignorant of their intrinsic worth.
  She did not even know them for diamonds. All she knew was that the white man
  loved them, that he valued them more highly than his other possessions and
  that he had repeatedly told her that he would die sooner than he would part
  with them.</p>

  <p>For a long time Miranda played with the diamonds and for a long time Uhha
  watched him; but at last he returned them to their bag, which he fastened
  securely inside his loincloth. Then he crawled beneath the thorn shelter,
  dragged a pile of thorns into the entrance to close it against the inroads of
  prowling beasts, and lay down upon the grasses beside Uhha.</p>

  <p>How was this little girl going to accomplish the theft of the diamonds
  from the huge, Amazonian Spaniard? She could not filch them by stealth, for
  the bag that contained them was so fastened inside his loincloth that it
  would be impossible to remove it without awakening him; and certainly this
  frail child could never wrest the jewels from Esteban by physical prowess.
  No, the whole scheme must die where it was born&mdash;inside Uhha's thick
  little skull.</p>

  <p>Outside the shelter the fire flickered, lighting the jungle grasses about
  it and casting weird, fantastic shadows that leaped and danced in the jungle
  night. Something moved stealthily among the lush vegetation a score of paces
  from the tiny camp. It was something large, for the taller grasses spread to
  its advance. They parted and a lion's head appeared. The yellow-green eyes
  gazed uneasily at the fire. From beyond came the odor of man and Numa was
  hungry; too, upon occasion he had eaten of man and found him good&mdash;also
  of all his prey the slowest and the least able to protect himself; but Numa
  did not like the looks of things here and so he turned and disappeared from
  whence he had come. He was not afraid of the fire. Had he been he would have
  been afraid of the sun by day, for the sun he could not even look at without
  discomfort, and to Numa the fire and the sun might have been one, for he had
  no way of knowing which was sixty feet away and which ninety-three million
  miles. It was the dancing shadows that caused his nervous apprehension. Huge,
  grotesque creatures of which he had had no experience seemed to be leaping
  all about him, threatening him from every side.</p>

  <p>But Uhha paid no attention to
  the dancing shadows and she had not seen Numa the lion. She lay very still
  now, listening. The fire flared less high as the slow minutes dragged their
  leaden feet along. It was not so very long that she lay thus, but it seemed
  long to Uhha, for she had her plan all matured and ready for execution. A
  civilized girl of twelve might have conceived it, but it is doubtful that she
  would have carried it to its conclusion. Uhha, however, was not civilized and
  being what she was she was not hampered by any qualms of conscience.</p>

  <p>Presently the Spaniard's breathing indicated that he was asleep. Uhha
  waited a little longer to make assurance doubly sure, then she reached
  beneath the grasses just beside her and when she withdrew her hand again she
  brought forth a short, stout cudgel. Slowly and cautiously she rose until she
  kneeled beside the recumbent form of the sleeping Spaniard. Then she raised
  her weapon above her head and brought it down once, heavily, upon Esteban's
  skull. She did not continue to beat him&mdash;the one blow was enough. She
  hoped that she had not killed him, for he must live if her scheme of revenge
  was to be realized; he must live and know that Uhha had stolen the bag of
  pebbles that he so worshiped. Uhha appropriated the knife that swung at
  Miranda's hip and with it she cut away his loincloth and took possession of
  the buckskin bag and its contents. Then she removed the thorns from the
  entrance to the shelter, slipped out into the night and vanished into the
  jungle. During all her wanderings with the Spaniard she had not once lost her
  sense of the direction which pointed toward her home, and now, free, she set
  her face resolutely toward the southwest and the village of Obebe the
  cannibal. An elephant trail formed a jungle highway along which she moved at
  a swinging walk, her way lighted by the rays of a full moon that filtered
  through the foliage of a sparse forest. She feared the jungle night and the
  nocturnal beasts of prey, but she knew that she must take this chance that
  she might put as great a distance as possible between herself and the white
  man before he regained consciousness and started in pursuit.</p>

  <p>A hundred yards ahead of her, in the dense thicket that bordered the
  trail, Numa the lion sniffed, and listened with up-pricked ears bent in her
  direction. No dancing shadows here to suggest menacing forms to Numa's
  high-strung nervous system&mdash;only the scent of man coming closer and
  closer&mdash;a young she-man, most tender of its kind. Numa licked his
  slavering jowls and waited.</p>

  <p>The girl came rapidly along the trail. Now she was abreast the lion, but
  the king of beasts did not spring. There is something in the scent of the
  man-thing and the sight of the man-thing that awakens strange terrors in the
  breast of Numa. When he stalks Horta the boar or Bara the deer there is
  nothing in the near presence of either that arouses a similar sensation in
  the savage carnivore; then he knows no hesitancy when the instant comes to
  spring upon his prey. It is only the man-thing, helpless and leaden-footed,
  that causes him to pause in indecision at the crucial moment.</p>

  <p>Uhha passed, ignorant of the fact that a great lion, hunting and hungry,
  stood within two paces of her. When she had passed Numa slunk into the trail
  behind her, and there he followed, stalking his tender quarry until the
  moment should come when the mists of his indecision should be dispelled. And
  so they went through the jungle night&mdash;the great lion, creeping on
  stealthy, noiseless pads, and just ahead of him the little black girl,
  unconscious of the grim death stalking her through the dappled moonlight.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Tarzan of the Apes regained consciousness he found
  himself lying upon an earthen floor in a large chamber. As he first opened
  his eyes, before complete consciousness returned, he noticed that the room
  was well, but not brilliantly, lighted, and that there were others there
  besides himself. Later, as he commenced to collect and dominate his faculties
  of thought he saw that the room was lighted by two immense candles that
  appeared to be fully three feet in diameter and, though evidently partially
  melted away, yet at least five feet tall. Each supported a wick fully as
  large as a man's wrist and though the manner of their burning was similar to
  the candles with which he was familiar, yet they gave off no smoke, nor were
  the beams and boards of the ceiling directly above them
  smoke-blackened.</p><a id="pic18"

    <p class="caption">Tarzan found himself lying upon an earthen floor in a
    large chamber.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The lights, being the most noticeable things in the room, had been the
  first to attract the ape-man's attention, but now his eyes wandered to the
  other occupants of the room. There were fifty or a hundred men of about his
  own height; but they were garbed and armed as had been the little men of
  Trohanadalmakus and Veltopismakus. Tarzan knit his brows and looked long and
  steadily at them. Who were they? Where was he?</p>

  <p>As consciousness spread slowly throughout his body he realized that he was
  in pain and that his arms felt heavy and numb. He tried to move them, only to
  discover that he could not&mdash;they were securely bound behind his back. He
  moved his feet&mdash;they were not secured. At last, after considerable
  effort, for he found that he was very weak, he raised himself to a sitting
  posture and looked about him. The room was filled with warriors who looked
  precisely like the little Veltopismakusians, but they were as large as normal
  men, and the room itself was immense. There were a number of benches and
  tables standing about the floor and most of the men either were seated upon
  the benches or lay stretched upon the hard earth. A few men moved about among
  them and seemed to be working over them. Then it was that Tarzan saw that
  nearly all within the chamber were suffering from wounds, many of them severe
  ones. The men who moved about among them were evidently attending to the
  wounded, and those, who might have been the nurses, were garbed in white
  tunics like the high caste slaves of Trohanadalmakus. In addition to the
  wounded and the nurses there were a half dozen armed warriors who were
  uninjured. One of these was the first to espy Tarzan after he had raised
  himself to a sitting posture.</p>

  <p>"Ho!" shouted he. "The giant has come to his senses," and crossing the
  room he approached the ape-man. Standing before him, his feet widespread, he
  eyed Tarzan with a broad grin upon his face. "Your great bulk availed you
  little," he taunted, "and now we are as large as you. We, too, are giants,
  eh?" and he turned to his fellows with a laugh in which they joined him.</p>

  <p>Seeing that he was a prisoner, surrounded by enemies, the ape-man fell
  back upon that lifelong characteristic of the wild beast&mdash;sullen
  silence. He made no reply, but only sat there regarding them with the savage,
  level gaze of the brute at bay.</p>

  <p>"He is dumb like the great beast-women of the caves," said the warrior to
  his fellows.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he is one of them," suggested another.</p>

  <p>"Yes," seconded a third, "perhaps he is one of the Zertalacolols."</p>

  <p>"But their men are all cowards," urged the first speaker; "and this one
  fought like a warrior born."</p>

  <p>"Yes, with his bare hands he fought till he went down."</p>

  <p>"You should have seen how he threw diadets and warriors as one might pick
  up tiny pebbles and hurl them afar."</p>

  <p>"He would not give a step, or run; and always he smiled."</p>

  <p>"He does not look like the men of the Zertalacolols; ask him if he
  is."</p>

  <p>He who had first addressed him put the question to Tarzan, but the ape-man
  only continued to glare at them.</p>

  <p>"He does not understand me," said the warrior. "I do not think that he is
  a Zertalacolol, though. What he is, however, I do not know."</p>

  <p>He approached and examined Tarzan's wounds. "These will soon be healed. In
  seven days, or less, he will be fit for the quarries."</p>

  <p>They sprinkled a brown powder upon his wounds and brought him food and
  water and the milk of antelopes, and when they found that his arms were
  swelling badly and becoming discolored they brought an iron chain and,
  fastening one end about his waist with a clumsy padlock, secured him to a
  ring in the stone wall of the chamber, and cut the bonds from his wrists.</p>

  <p>As they believed that he did not understand their language they spoke
  freely before him, but as their tongue was almost identical with that
  employed by the Trohanadalmakusians Tarzan understood everything that they
  said, and thus he learned that the battle before the city of Adendrohahkis
  had not gone as well for the Veltopismakusians as Elkomoelhago, their king,
  had desired. They had lost many in killed and prisoners and in return had not
  killed near so many of the enemy and had taken comparatively few prisoners,
  though Elkomoelhago, he learned, considered him worth the entire cost of the
  brief war.</p>

  <p>How they had changed themselves into men of his own stature Tarzan could
  not comprehend, nor did any of the remarks he overheard shed any light upon
  this mystery of mysteries. But the climax of improbability was attained a few
  days later when he saw pass through the corridor, upon which the room of his
  incarceration was located, a file of warriors as large as he, each of whom
  was mounted upon a huge antelope fully as tall at the shoulder as the great
  eland, though obviously, from its contour and markings, a Royal Antelope,
  which is the smallest known. Tarzan ran his brown fingers through his thatch
  of black hair and gave up attempting to solve the enigmas that surrounded
  him.</p>

  <p>His wounds healed quickly, as did those of the Veltopismakusians who were
  convalescing about him, and upon the seventh day a half-dozen warriors came
  for him and the chain was removed from about his waist that he might
  accompany them. His captors had long since ceased to address him, believing
  that he was ignorant of their language, which meant to them that he was as
  speechless as an Alalus, since they could conceive of no language other than
  their own; but from their conversation, as they led him from the chamber and
  along a circular corridor, he discovered that he was being taken before their
  king, Elkomoelhago, who had expressed a desire to see this remarkable captive
  after he had recovered from his wounds.</p>

  <p>The long corridor, through which they were proceeding, was lighted
  partially by small candles set in niches and by the light from illuminated
  chambers the doors of which opened upon it. Slaves and warriors moved in two
  continuous and opposing lines through this corridor and every one that
  crossed it. There were high caste slaves in white tunics with the red emblems
  of their owners and their own occupation insignia upon them; there were
  green-tunicked slaves of the second generation with their master's insignia
  upon breast and back in black, and green-tunicked slaves of the first
  generation with a black emblem upon their breasts denoting the city of their
  nativity and their master's emblem upon their backs; there were warriors of
  every rank and position; there were the plain leather trappings of the young
  and poor, and the jewel-studded harness of the rich; and passing all these in
  both directions and often at high speed were other warriors mounted upon the
  mighty antelopes that were still the greatest wonder that had confronted
  Tarzan since his incarceration in the city of Veltopismakus.</p>

  <p>At intervals along the corridor Tarzan saw ladders extending to a floor
  above, but as he never saw one descending to a lower level he assumed that
  they were then upon the lowest floor of the structure.</p><a id="pic19"
        name="pic19"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

    <p class="caption">At intervals along the corridor Tarzan saw ladders
    extending to a floor above.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>From the construction that he noted he was convinced that the building was
  similar to the dome he had seen in the course of construction in the city of
  Adendrohahkis; but when he permitted his mind to dwell upon the tremendous
  proportions of such a dome capable of housing men of his own size he was
  staggered. Had Adendrohahkis' dome been duplicated in these greater
  dimensions, though in the same proportions, it would have been eight hundred
  eighty feet in diameter and four hundred forty feet high. It seemed
  preposterous to think that any race existed capable of accomplishing such an
  architectural feat with only the primitive means that these people might be
  able to command, yet here were the corridors with the arched roofs, the walls
  of neatly laid boulders and the great chambers with their heavy ceiling beams
  and stout columns, all exactly as he had seen the dome in Trohanadalmakus,
  but on a vastly larger scale.</p>

  <p>As his eyes and mind dwelt upon these enigmas which confronted them his
  escort led him from the circular corridor into one that ran at right angles
  to it where presently they stopped at the entrance to a chamber filled with
  row upon row of shelving packed full with all manner of manufactured
  articles. There were large candles and small candles, candles of every
  conceivable size and shape; there were helmets, belts, sandals, tunics,
  bowls, jars, vases and the thousand other articles of the daily life of the
  Minunians with which Tarzan had become more or less familiar during his
  sojourn among the Trohanadalmakusians.</p>

  <p>As they halted before the entrance to this room a white-tunicked slave
  came forward in response to the summons of one of the warriors of the
  escort.</p>

  <p>"A green tunic for this fellow from Trohanadalmakus," he ordered.</p>

  <p>"Whose insignia upon his back?" inquired the slave.</p>

  <p>"He belongs to Zoanthrohago," replied the warrior.</p>

  <p>The slave ran quickly to one of the shelves from which he selected a green
  tunic. From another he took two large, wooden blocks upon the face of each of
  which was carved a different device. These he covered evenly with some sort
  of paint or ink, slipped a smooth board inside the tunic, placed one of the
  dies face downward upon the cloth, tapped it smartly with a wooden mallet
  several times and then repeated the operation with the other die upon the
  reverse side of the tunic. When he handed the garment to Tarzan with the
  instructions to don it the ape-man saw that it bore a device in black upon
  the breast and another upon the back, but he could not read them&mdash;his
  education had not progressed thus far.</p>

  <p>The slave then gave him a pair of sandals and when he had strapped these
  to his feet the warriors motioned him on down the corridor, which, as they
  proceeded, he was aware changed rapidly in appearance. The rough boulder
  walls were plastered now and decorated with colored paintings portraying,
  most often, battle scenes and happenings of the hunt, usually framed in
  panels bordered in intricate, formal designs. Vivid colorings predominated.
  Many-hued candles burned in frequent niches. Gorgeously trapped warriors were
  numerous. The green-tunicked slave almost disappeared, while the white tunics
  of the higher caste bondsmen were of richer material and the slaves
  themselves were often resplendently trapped with jewels and fine leather.</p>

  <p>The splendor of the scene, the brilliancy of the lighting, increased until
  the corridor came to an abrupt end before two massive doors of hammered gold
  in front of which stood gorgeously trapped warriors who halted them and
  questioned the commander of the escort as to their business.</p>

  <p>"By the king's command we bring the slave of Zoanthrohago," replied the
  commander, "the giant who was taken prisoner at Trohanadalmakus."</p>

  <p>The warrior who had challenged them turned to one of his fellows. "Go with
  this message and deliver it to the king!" he said.</p>

  <p>After the messenger had departed the warriors fell to examining Tarzan and
  asking many questions concerning him, to few of which could his guard give
  more than speculative answers, and then, presently, the messenger returned
  with word that the party was immediately to be admitted to the king's
  presence. The heavy doors were swung wide and Tarzan found himself upon the
  threshold of an enormous chamber, the walls of which converged toward the
  opposite end, where a throne stood upon a dais. Massive wooden columns
  supported the ceiling, which was plastered between its beams. The beams as
  well as the columns were ornamented with carving, while the plastered
  portions of the ceiling carried gorgeous arabesques in brilliant colors. The
  walls were paneled to half their height, and above the paneling of wood were
  painted panels which Tarzan assumed depicted historical events from the
  history of Veltopismakus and her kings.</p>

  <p>The room was vacant except for two warriors who stood before doors that
  flanked the throne dais, and as the party moved down the broad center aisle
  toward the throne one of these warriors signaled the leader and motioned to
  the door which he was guarding and which he now threw open before them,
  revealing a small antechamber in which were half a dozen handsomely trapped
  warriors seated on small, carved benches, while a seventh lolled in a
  high-backed chair, his fingers tapping upon its broad arms as he listened to
  the conversation of the others, into which he threw an occasional word that
  always was received with deepest attention. If he scowled when he spoke, the
  others scowled still more deeply; if he smiled, they broke into laughter, and
  scarcely for an instant did their eyes leave his face, lest they miss some
  fleeting index of his changing moods.</p>

  <p>Just inside the doorway the warriors who were conducting Tarzan halted,
  where they remained in silence until the man in the high-backed armchair
  deigned to notice them, then the leader knelt upon one knee, raised his arms,
  palms forward, high above his head, leaned as far back as he could and in a
  monotonous dead level intoned his salutation.</p>

  <p>"O, Elkomoelhago, King of Veltopismakus, Ruler of All Men, Master of
  Created Things, All-Wise, All-Courageous, All-Glorious! We bring these, as
  thou hast commanded, the slave of Zoanthrohago."</p>

  <p>"Arise and bring the slave closer," commanded the man in the high-backed
  armchair, and then to his companions: "This is the giant that Zoanthrohago
  brought back from Trohanadalmakus."</p>

  <p>"We have heard of him, All-Glorious," they replied.</p>

  <p>"And of Zoanthrohago's wager?" questioned the king.</p>

  <p>"And of Zoanthrohago's wager, All-Wise!" replied one.</p>

  <p>"What think you of it?" demanded Elkomoelhago.</p>

  <p>"Even as you think, Ruler of All Men," quickly spoke another.</p>

  <p>"And how is that?" asked the king.</p>

  <p>The six looked quickly and uneasily, one at the others. "How <i>does</i> he
  think?" whispered he who was farthest from Elkomoelhago to his neighbor, who
  shrugged his shoulders hopelessly and looked to another.</p>

  <p>"What was that, Gofoloso?" demanded the king. "What was that you
  said?"</p>

  <p>"I was about to remark that unless Zoanthrohago first consulted our august
  and all-wise ruler and is now acting upon his judgment he must, almost of
  necessity, lose the wager," replied Gofoloso glibly.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said the king, "there is something in what you say, Gofoloso.
  Zoanthrohago did consult me. It was I who discovered the vibratory principle
  which made the thing possible. It was I who decided just how the first
  experiments were to be carried out. Heretofore it has not been enduring; but
  we believe that the new formula will have a persistency of thirty-nine moons
  at least&mdash;it is upon this that Zoanthrohago has made his wager. If he is
  wrong he loses a thousand slaves to Dalfastomalo."</p>

  <p>"Wonderful!" exclaimed Gofoloso. "Blessed indeed are we above all other
  peoples, with a king so learned and so wise as Elkomoelhago."</p>

  <p>"You have much to be thankful for, Gofoloso," agreed the king; "but
  nothing compared to what will follow the success of my efforts to apply this
  principle of which we have been speaking, but with results diametrically
  opposite to those we have so far achieved; but we work upon it, we work upon
  it. Some day it will come and then I shall give to Zoanthrohago the formula
  that will revolutionize Minuni&mdash;then with a hundred men might we go
  forth and conquer the world!"</p>

  <p>Elkomoelhago now turned his attention suddenly upon the green-tunicked
  slave standing a short distance before him. He scrutinized him closely and in
  silence for several minutes.</p>

  <p>"From what city do you come?" demanded the king, at last</p>

  <p>"O, All-Glorious Elkomoelhago," spoke up the leader of the escort, "the
  poor ignorant creature is without speech."</p>

  <p>"Utters he any sound?" inquired the king.</p>

  <p>"None since he was captured, Master of Men," replied the warrior.</p>

  <p>"He is a Zertalacolol," stated Elkomoelhago. "Why all this silly
  excitement over one of these low, speechless creatures?"</p>

  <p>"See now!" exclaimed Gofoloso, "how quickly and surely the father of
  wisdom grasps all things, probing to the bottom of all mysteries, revealing
  their secrets. Is it not marvelous!"</p>

  <p>"Now that the Sun of Science has shone upon him even the dullest may see
  that the creature is indeed a Zertalacolol," cried another of the king's
  companions. "How simple, how stupid of us all! Ah, what would become of us
  were it not for the glorious intelligence of the All-Wise."</p>

  <p>Elkomoelhago was examining Tarzan closely. He seemed not to have heard the
  eulogies of his courtiers. Presently he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"He has not the features of the Zertalacolols," he pondered musingly. "See
  his ears. They are not the ears of the speechless ones, nor his hair. His
  body is not formed as theirs and his head is shaped for the storing of
  knowledge and the functioning of reason. No, he cannot be a
  Zertalacolol."</p>

  <p>"Marvelous!" cried Gofoloso. "Did I not tell you! Elkomoelhago, our king,
  is always right?"</p>

  <p>"The most stupid of us may easily see that he is not a Zertalacolol, now
  that the king's divine intelligence has made it go plain," exclaimed the
  second courtier.</p>

  <p>At this juncture a door, opposite that through which Tarzan had been
  brought into the apartment, opened and a warrior appeared. "O, Elkomoelhago,
  King of Veltopismakus," he droned, "thy daughter, the Princess Janzara, has
  come. She would see the strange slave that Zoanthrohago brought from
  Trohanadalmakus and craves the royal permission to enter."</p>

  <p>Elkomoelhago nodded his assent "Conduct the princess to us!" he
  commanded.</p>

  <p>The princess must have been waiting within earshot immediately outside the
  door, for scarcely had the king spoken when she appeared upon the threshold,
  followed by two other young women, behind whom were a half dozen warriors. At
  sight of her the courtiers rose, but not the king.</p><a id="pic20"

    <p class="caption">The princess appeared upon the threshold.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"Come in, Janzara," he said, "and behold the strange giant who is more
  discussed in Veltopismakus than Veltopismakus' king."</p>

  <p>The princess crossed the room and stood directly in front of the ape-man,
  who remained standing, as he had since he had entered the chamber, with arms
  folded across his broad chest, an expression of absolute indifference upon
  his face. He glanced at the princess as she approached him and saw that she
  was a very beautiful young woman. Except for an occasional distant glimpse of
  some of the women of Trohanadalmakus she was the first Minunian female Tarzan
  had seen. Her features were faultlessly chiseled, her soft, dark hair
  becomingly arranged beneath a gorgeous, jeweled headdress, her clear skin
  shaming the down of the peach in its softness. She was dressed entirely in
  white, befitting a virgin princess in the palace of her sire; her gown, of a
  soft, clinging stuff, fell in straight and simple lines to her arched
  insteps. Tarzan looked into her eyes. They were gray, but the shadows of her
  heavy lashes made them appear much darker than they were. He sought there an
  index to her character, for here was the young woman whom his friend,
  Komodoflorensal, hoped some day to espouse and make queen of Trohanadalmakus,
  and for this reason was the ape-man interested. He saw the beautiful brows
  knit into a sudden frown.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with the beast?" cried the princess. "Is it made of
  wood?"</p>

  <p>"It speaks no language, nor understands any," explained her father. "It
  has uttered no sound since it was captured."</p>

  <p>"It is a sullen, ugly brute," said the princess. "I'll wager to make it
  utter a sound, and that quickly," with which she snatched a thin dagger from
  her belt and plunged it into Tarzan's arm. With such celerity had she moved
  that her act had taken all who witnessed it by surprise; but she had given
  the Lord of the Jungle an instant's warning in the few words she had spoken
  before she struck and these had been sufficient for him. He could not avoid
  the blow, but he could and did avoid giving her the satisfaction of seeing
  her cruel experiment succeed, for he uttered no sound. Perhaps she would have
  struck again, for she was very angry now, but the king spoke sharply to
  her.</p>

  <p>"Enough, Janzara!" he cried. "We would have no harm befall this slave upon
  whom we are conducting an experiment that means much to the future of
  Veltopismakus."</p>

  <p>"He has dared to stare into my eyes," cried the princess, "and he has
  refused to speak when he knew that it would give me pleasure. He should be
  killed!"</p>

  <p>"He is not yours to kill," returned the king. "He belongs to
  Zoanthrohago."</p>

  <p>"I will buy him," and turning to one of her warriors, "Fetch
  Zoanthrohago!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Esteban Miranda regained consciousness, the fire before
  his rude shelter was but a heap of cold ashes and dawn had almost come. He
  felt weak and dizzy and his head ached. He put his hand to it and found his
  thick hair matted with coagulated blood. He found something else as
  well&mdash;a great wound in his scalp, that made him shudder and turn sick,
  so that he fainted. When again he opened his eyes it was quite daylight. He
  looked about him questioning. Where was he? He called aloud in
  Spanish&mdash;called to a woman with a musical name. Not Flora Hawkes, but a
  soft, Spanish name that Flora never had heard.</p>

  <p>He was sitting up now and presently he regarded his nakedness in evident
  surprise. He picked up the loincloth that had been cut from his body. Then he
  looked all about him on the ground&mdash;his eyes dull, stupid, wondering. He
  found his weapons and picking them up examined them. For a long time he sat
  fingering them and looking at them, his brows puckered in thought. The knife,
  the spear, the bow and arrows he went over time and time again.</p>

  <p>He looked out upon the jungle scene before him and the expression of
  bewilderment on his face but increased. He half-rose, remaining upon his
  knees. A startled rodent scurried across the clearing. At sight of it the man
  seized his bow and fitted an arrow, but the animal was gone before he could
  loose his shaft Still kneeling, the bewildered expression upon his
  countenance deepening, he gazed in mute astonishment upon the weapon he held
  so familiarly in his hand. He arose, gathered up his spear and knife and the
  balance of his arrows and started off into the jungle.</p>

  <p>A hundred yards from his shelter he came upon a lion feeding upon the
  carcass of its kill that it had dragged into the bushes beside the wide
  elephant trail along which the man made his way. The lion growled ominously.
  The man halted, listening intently. He was still bewildered; but only for an
  instant did he remain motionless in the trail. With the spring of a panther
  he gained the low swinging limb of the nearest tree. There he squatted for a
  few minutes. He could see Numa the lion feeding upon the carcass of some
  animal&mdash;what the animal had been he could not determine. After a while
  the man dropped silently from the tree and went off into the jungle in the
  opposite direction from that he had at first chanced upon. He was naked, but
  he did not know it. His diamonds were gone, but he would not have known a
  diamond had he seen one. Uhha had left him, but he did not miss her, for he
  knew not that she ever had existed.</p>

  <p>Blindly and yet well, his muscles reacted to every demand made upon them
  in the name of the first law of nature. He had not known why he leaped to a
  tree at the sound of Numa's growl, nor could he have told why he walked in
  the opposite direction when he saw where Numa lay up with his kill. He did
  not know that his hand leaped to a weapon at each new sound or movement in
  the jungle about him.</p>

  <p>Uhha had defeated her own ends. Esteban Miranda was not being punished for
  his sins for the very excellent reason that he was conscious of no sins nor
  of any existence. Uhha had killed his objective mind. His brain was but a
  storehouse of memories that would never again be raised above the threshold
  of consciousness. When acted upon by the proper force they stimulated the
  nerves that controlled his muscles, with results seemingly identical with
  those that would have followed had he been able to reason. An emergency
  beyond his experience would, consequently, have found him helpless, though
  ignorant of his helplessness. It was almost as though a dead man walked
  through the jungle. Sometimes he moved along in silence, again he babbled
  childishly in Spanish, or, perhaps, quoted whole pages of Shakespeare in
  English.</p>

  <p>Could Uhha have seen him now, even she, savage little cannibal, might have
  felt remorse at the horror of her handiwork, which was rendered even more
  horrible because its miserable object was totally unconscious of it; but Uhha
  was not there to see, nor any other mortal; and the poor clay that once had
  been a man moved on aimlessly through the jungle, killing and eating when the
  right nerves were excited, sleeping, talking, walking as though he lived as
  other men live; and thus, watching him from afar, we see him disappear amidst
  the riotous foliage of a jungle trail.</p>

  <p><br>
  THE Princess Janzara of Veltopismakus did not purchase the slave of
  Zoanthrohago. Her father, the king, would not permit it, and so, very angry,
  she walked from the apartment where she had come to examine the captive and
  when she had passed into the next room and was out of her royal sire's range
  of vision, she turned and made a face in his direction, at which all her
  warriors and the two hand-maidens laughed.</p>

  <p>"Fool!" she whispered in the direction of her unconscious father. "I shall
  own the slave yet and kill him, too, if I mind."</p>

  <p>The warriors and the hand-maidens nodded their heads approvingly.</p>

  <p>King Elkomoelhago arose languidly from his chair. "Take it to the
  quarries," he said, indicating Tarzan with a motion of his thumb, "but tell
  the officer in charge that it is the king's wish that it be not overworked,
  nor injured," and as the ape-man was led away through one doorway, the king
  quitted the chamber by another, his six courtiers bowing in the strange,
  Minunian way until he was gone. Then one of them tiptoed quickly to the
  doorway through which Elkomoelhago had disappeared, flattened himself against
  the wall beside the door and listened for a moment. Apparently satisfied, he
  cautiously insinuated his head beyond the doorframe until he could view the
  chamber adjoining with one eye, then he turned back toward his fellows.</p>

  <p>"The old half-wit has gone," he announced, though in a whisper that would
  have been inaudible beyond the chamber in which it was breathed, for even in
  Minuni they have learned that the walls have ears, though they express it
  differently, saying, instead: <i>Trust not too far the loyalty of even the
  stones of your chamber</i>.</p>

  <p>"Saw you ever a creature endowed with such inordinate vanity!" exclaimed
  one.</p>

  <p>"He believes that he is wiser than, not any man, but all men combined,"
  said another. "Sometimes I feel that I can abide his arrogance no
  longer."</p>

  <p>"But you will, Gefasto," said Gofoloso. "To be Chief of Warriors of
  Veltopismakus is too rich a berth to be lightly thrown aside."</p>

  <p>"When one might simultaneously throw away one's life at the same time,"
  added Torndali, Chief of Quarries.</p>

  <p>"But the colossal effrontery of the man!" ejaculated another, Makahago,
  Chief of Buildings. "He has had no more to do with Zoanthrohago's success
  than have I and yet he claims the successes all for himself and blames the
  failures upon Zoanthrohago."</p>

  <p>"The glory of Veltopismakus is threatened by his egotism," cried
  Throwaldo, Chief of Agriculture. "He has chosen us as his advisers, six
  princes, whose knowledge of their several departments should be greater than
  that of any other individuals and whose combined knowledge of the needs of
  Veltopismakus and the affairs of state should form a bulwark against the
  egregious errors that he is constantly committing; but never will he heed our
  advice. To offer it he considers a usurpation of his royal prerogatives, to
  urge it, little short of treason. To question his judgment spells ruin. Of
  what good are we to Veltopismakus? What must the people of the state think of
  us?"</p>

  <p>"It is well known what they think of us," snapped Gofoloso. "They say that
  we were chosen, not for what we know, but for what we do not know. Nor can
  you blame them. I, a breeder of diadets, master of ten thousand slaves who
  till the soil and raise a half of all the food that the city consumes, am
  chosen Chief of Chiefs, filling an office for which I have no liking and no
  training, while Throwaldo, who scarce knows the top of a vegetable from its
  roots, is Chief of Agriculture. Makahago worked the quarry slaves for a
  hundred moons and is made Chief of Buildings, while Torndali, who is
  acclaimed the greatest builder of our time, is Chief of Quarries. Gefasto and
  Vestako, alone, are masters of their bureaus. Vestako the king chose wisely
  as Chief of the Royal Dome, that his royal comfort and security might be
  assured; but in Gefasto behold his greatest blunder! He elevated a gay young
  pleasure-seeker to the command of the army of Veltopismakus and discovered in
  his new Chief of Warriors as great a military genius as Veltopismakus has
  ever produced."</p>

  <p>Gefasto bowed his acknowledgment of the compliment.</p>

  <p>"Had it not been for Gefasto the Trohanadalmakusians would have trapped us
  fairly the other day," continued Gofoloso.</p>

  <p>"I advised the king against pushing the assault," interjected Gefasto, "as
  soon as it became evident that we had failed to surprise them. We should have
  withdrawn. It was only after we had advanced and I was free from him that I
  could direct the affair without interference, and then, as you saw, I quickly
  extricated our troops and withdrew them with as little loss of men and
  prestige as possible."</p>

  <p>"It was nobly done, Gefasto," said Torndali. "The troops worship you. They
  would like a king who led them in battle as you might lead them."</p>

  <p>"And let them have their wine as of old," interjected Makahago.</p>

  <p>"We would all rally around a king who permitted us the innocent pleasure
  of our wine," said Gofoloso: "What say you, Vestako?"</p>

  <p>The Chief of the Royal Dome, the king's major-domo, who had remained
  silent throughout the arraignment of his master, shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is not wise to speak treason now," he said.</p>

  <p>The three looked sharply at him and glanced quickly at one another.</p>

  <p>"Who has spoken treason, Vestako?" demanded Gofoloso.</p>

  <p>"You have all come too close to it for safety," said the oily Vestako. He
  spoke in a much louder voice than the others had spoken, as though, far from
  being fearful of being overheard, he rather hoped that he would be.
  "Elkomoelhago has been good to us. He has heaped honors and riches upon us.
  We are very powerful. He is a wise ruler. Who are we to question the wisdom
  of his acts?"</p>

  <p>The others looked uneasily about. Gofoloso laughed nervously. "You were
  ever slow to appreciate a joke, my good Vestako." he said. "Could you not see
  that we were hoaxing you?"</p>

  <p>"I could not," replied Vestako, "but the king has a fine sense of humor. I
  will repeat the joke to him and if he laughs then I shall laugh, too, for I
  shall know that it was indeed a joke. But I wonder upon whom it will be!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Vestako, do not repeat what we have said&mdash;not to the king. He
  might not understand. We are good friends and it was said only among
  friends." Gofoloso was evidently perturbed in spirit&mdash;he spoke rapidly.
  "By the way, my good Vestako, I just happened to recall that the other day
  you admired one of my slaves. I have intended giving him to you. If you will
  accept him he is yours."</p>

  <p>"I admire a hundred of your slaves," said Vestako, softly.</p>

  <p>"They are yours, Vestako," said Gofoloso. "Come with me now and select
  them. It is a pleasure to make my friend so trifling a present."</p>

  <p>Vestako looked steadily at the other four. They shifted uneasily in
  momentary silence, which was broken by Throwaldo, Chief of Agriculture. "If
  Vestako would accept a hundred of my poor slaves I should be overwhelmed with
  delight," he said.</p>

  <p>"I hope they will be slaves of the white tunic," said Vestako.</p>

  <p>"They will," said Throwaldo.</p>

  <p>"I cannot be outdone in generosity," said Torndali; "you must accept a
  hundred slaves from me."</p>

  <p>"And from me!" cried Makahago, Chief of Buildings.</p>

  <p>"If you will send them to my head slave at my quarters before the Sun
  enters the Warriors' Corridor I shall be overwhelmed with gratitude," said
  Vestako, rubbing his palms and smiling unctuously. Then he looked quickly and
  meaningly at Gefasto, Chief of Warriors of Veltopismakus.</p>

  <p>"Best can I show my friendship for the noble Vestako," said Gefasto,
  unsmiling, "by assuring him that I shall, if possible, prevent my warriors
  from slipping a dagger between his ribs. Should aught of harm befall me,
  however, I fear that I cannot be responsible for the acts of these men, who,
  I am told, love me." For a moment longer he stood looking straight into the
  eyes of Vestako, then he turned upon his heel and strode from the room.</p>

  <p>Of the six men who composed the Royal Council, Gefasto and Gofoloso were
  the most fearless, though even they flattered the vain and arrogant
  Elkomoelhago, whose despotic powers rendered him a most dangerous enemy.
  Custom and inherent loyalty to the royal family, in addition to that most
  potent of human instrumentalities&mdash;self-interest, held them, to the
  service of their king, but so long had they been plotting against him and so
  rife was discontent throughout the city, that each now felt that he might
  become bolder with impunity.</p>

  <p>Torndali, Makahago and Throwaldo having been chosen by the king for their
  supposed pliability and having, unlike Gefasto and Gofoloso, justified his
  expectations, counted for little one way or another. Like the majority of the
  Veltopismakusian nobles under the reign of Elkomoelhago they had become
  corrupt, and self-interest guided their every act and thought. Gefasto did
  not trust them, for he knew that they could be bought even while professing
  their virtue, and Gefasto had taken to the study of men since his success
  with the warriors of his city&mdash;a success that was fully as much a
  surprise to him as to others&mdash;and his knowledge of the mounting
  restlessness of the people had implanted in the fertile soil of a virile
  brain the idea that Veltopismakus was ripe for a new dynasty.</p>

  <p>Vestako he knew for a self-acknowledged and shameless bribe-taker. He did
  not believe that there was an honest hair in the man's head, but he had been
  surprised at the veiled threat of exposure he had used to mulct his
  fellows.</p>

  <p>"Low indeed have fallen the fortunes of Veltopismakus," he said to
  Gofoloso as the two walked along the Warriors' Corridor after quitting the
  council chamber of the king.</p>

  <p>"As exemplified by&mdash;?" queried the Chief of Chiefs.</p>

  <p>"By Vestako's infamy. He cares neither for king nor for people. For slaves
  or gold he would betray either, and Vestako is typical of the majority of us.
  No longer is friendship sacred, for even from Throwaldo he exacted the toll
  of his silence, and Throwaldo has ever been accounted his best friend."</p>

  <p>"What has brought us to such a pass, Gefasto?" asked Gofoloso,
  thoughtfully. "Some attribute it to one cause and some to another, and though
  there should be no man in Veltopismakus better able than myself to answer my
  own question, I confess that I am at a loss. There are many theories, but I
  doubt me the right one has yet been expounded."</p>

  <p>"If one should ask me, Gofoloso, and you have asked me, I should say to
  him as I am about to say to you that the trouble with Veltopismakus is too
  much peace. Prosperity follows peace&mdash;prosperity and plenty of idle
  time. Time must be occupied. Who would occupy it in labor, even the labor of
  preparing one's self to defend one's peace and prosperity, when it may so
  easily be occupied in the pursuit of pleasure? The material prosperity that
  has followed peace has given us the means to gratify our every whim. We have
  become satiated with the things we looked upon in the days of yesterday as
  luxuries to be sparingly enjoyed upon rare occasion. Consequently we have
  been forced to invent new whims to be gratified and you may rest assured that
  these have become more and more extravagant and exaggerated in form and idea
  until even our wondrous prosperity has been taxed to meet the demands of our
  appetites.</p>

  <p>"Extravagance reigns supreme. It rests, like a malign incubus, upon the
  king and his government. To mend its inroads upon the treasury, the burden of
  the incubus is shifted from the back of the government to the back of the
  people in the form of outrageous taxes which no man can meet honestly and
  have sufficient remaining wherewith to indulge his appetites, and so by one
  means or another, he passes the burden on to those less fortunate or less
  shrewd."</p>

  <p>"But the heaviest taxation falls upon the rich," Gofoloso reminded
  him.</p>

  <p>"In theory, but not in fact," replied Gefasto. "It is true that the rich
  pay the bulk of the taxes into the treasury of the king, but first they
  collect it from the poor in higher prices and other forms of extortion, in
  the proportion of two jetaks for every one that they pay to the tax
  collector. The cost of collecting this tax added to the loss in revenue to
  the government by the abolition of wine and the cost of preventing the
  unscrupulous from making and selling wine illicitly would, if turned back
  into the coffers of the government, reduce our taxes so materially that they
  would fall as a burden upon none."</p>

  <p>"And that, you think, would solve our problems and restore happiness to
  Veltopismakus?" asked Gofoloso.</p>

  <p>"No," replied his fellow prince. "We must have war. As we have found that
  there is no enduring happiness in peace or virtue, let us have a little war
  and a little sin. A pudding that is all of one ingredient is
  nauseating&mdash;it must be seasoned, it must be spiced, and before we can
  enjoy the eating of it to the fullest we must be forced to strive for it. War
  and work, the two most distasteful things in the world, are, nevertheless,
  the most essential to the happiness and the existence of a people. Peace
  reduces the necessity for labor, and induces slothfulness. War compels labor,
  that her ravages may be effaced. Peace turns us into fat worms. War makes men
  of us."</p>

  <p>"War and wine, then, would restore Veltopismakus to her former pride and
  happiness, you think?" laughed Gofoloso. "What a firebrand you have become
  since you came to the command of all the warriors of our city!"</p>

  <p>"You misunderstand me, Gofoloso," said Gefasto, patiently. "War and wine
  alone will accomplish nothing but our ruin. I have no quarrel with peace or
  virtue or temperance. My quarrel is with the misguided theorists who think
  that peace alone, or virtue alone, or temperance alone will make a strong, a
  virile, a contented nation. They must be mixed with war and wine and sin and
  a great measure of hard work&mdash;especially hard work&mdash;and with
  nothing but peace and prosperity there is little necessity for hard work, and
  only the exceptional man works hard when he does not have to.</p>

  <p>"But come, you must hasten to deliver the hundred slaves to Vestako before
  the Sun enters the Warriors' Corridor, or he will tell your little joke to
  Elkomoelhago."</p>

  <p>Gofoloso smiled ruefully. "Some day he shall pay for these hundred
  slaves," he said, "and the price will be very high."</p>

  <p>"If his master falls," said Gefasto.</p>

  <p>"<i>When</i> his master falls!" Gofoloso corrected.</p>

  <p>The Chief of Warriors shrugged his shoulders, but he smiled contentedly,
  and he was still smiling after his friend had turned into an intersecting
  corridor and gone his way.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TARZAN of the Apes was led directly from the Royal Dome to
  the quarries of Veltopismakus, which lie a quarter of a mile from the nearer
  of the eight domes which constitute the city. A ninth dome was in course of
  construction and it was toward this that the line of burdened slaves wound
  from the entrance to the quarry to which the ape-man was conducted. Just
  below the surface, in a well-lighted chamber, he was turned over to the
  officer in charge of the quarry guard, to whom the king's instructions
  concerning him were communicated.</p>

  <p>"Your name?" demanded the officer, opening a large book that lay upon the
  table at which he was seated.</p>

  <p>"He is as dumb as the Zertalacolols," explained the commander of the
  escort that had brought him to the quarry. "Therefore he has no name."</p>

  <p>"We will call him The Giant, then," said the officer, "for as such has he
  been known since his capture," and he wrote in his book, <i>Zuanthrol</i>, with
  Zoanthrohago as the owner, and Trohanadalmakus as the city of his origin, and
  then he turned to one of the warriors lolling upon a nearby bench.
  "Take him to the timbering crew in the extension of tunnel thirteen at the
  thirty-sixth level and tell the Vental in charge to give him light work and
  see that no harm befalls him, for such are the commands of the Thagostogol.
  But wait! Here is his number. Fasten it upon his shoulder."</p>

  <p>The warrior took the circular piece of fabric with black hieroglyphics
  stamped upon it and affixed it with a metal clasp to the left shoulder of
  Tarzan's green tunic and then, motioning the ape-man to precede him, quit the
  chamber.</p>

  <p>Tarzan now found himself in a short, dark corridor which presently opened
  into a wider and lighter one along which innumerable, unladen slaves were
  moving in the same direction that his guard now escorted him. He noticed that
  the floor of the corridor had a constant downward gradient and that it turned
  ever to the right, forming a great spiral leading downward into the earth.
  The walls and ceiling were timbered and the floor paved with flat stones,
  worn smooth by the millions of sandaled feet that had passed over them. At
  sufficiently frequent intervals candles were set in niches in the left-hand
  wall, and, also at regular intervals, other corridors opened out of it. Over
  each of these openings were more of the strange hieroglyphics of Minuni. As
  Tarzan was to learn later, these designated the levels at which the tunnels
  lay and led to circular corridors which surrounded the main spiral runway.
  From these circular corridors ran the numerous horizontal tunnels leading to
  the workings at each level. Shafts for ventilation and emergency exit pierced
  these tunnels at varying distances, running from the surface to the lowest
  levels of the quarry.</p>

  <p>At almost every level a few slaves turned off into these lateral tunnels
  which were well lighted, though not quite as brilliantly as the spiral.
  Shortly after they had commenced the descent, Tarzan, accustomed from infancy
  to keen observation, had taken note of the numbers of tunnel entrances they
  passed, but he could only conjecture at the difference in the depths of the
  levels into which they opened. A rough guess placed them at fifteen feet, but
  before they reached the thirty-sixth, into which they turned, Tarzan felt
  that there must be an error in his calculations, for he was sure that they
  could not be five hundred and forty feet below the earth's surface with open
  flames and no forced ventilation.</p>

  <p>The horizontal corridor they now entered after leaving the spiral curved
  sharply to the right and then back to the left. Shortly afterward it crossed
  a wide, circular corridor in which were both laden and unladen slaves, beyond
  which were two lines, those laden with rock moving back in the direction from
  which Tarzan had come, while others, bearing lumber moved in the same
  direction that he did. With both lines there were unladen slaves.</p>

  <p>After traversing the horizontal tunnel for a considerable distance they
  came at last upon the working party, and here Tarzan was turned over to the
  Vental, a warrior who, in the military organizations of the Minunians,
  commands ten men.</p>

  <p>"So this is The Giant!" exclaimed the Vental. "And we are not to work him
  too hard." His tone was sneering and disagreeable. "Such a giant!" he cried.
  "Why, he is no larger than I and they are afraid to let him do any work into
  the bargain. Mark you, he will work here or get the lash. Kalfastoban permits
  no sluggards," and the fellow struck his chest vauntingly.</p>

  <p>He who had brought Tarzan appeared disgusted. "You will do well,
  Kalfastoban," he said, as he turned away to retrace his steps to the guard
  room, "to heed the king's commands. I should hate to be wearing your harness
  if aught befell this speechless slave that has set every tongue in
  Veltopismakus going and made Elkomoelhago so jealous of Zoanthrohago that he
  would slip steel between his ribs were it not that he could then no longer
  steal the great wizard's applause."</p>

  <p>"Kalfastoban fears no king," blustered the Vental, "least of all the sorry
  specimen that befouls the throne of Veltopishago. He fools no one but
  himself. We all know that Zoanthrohago is his brain and Gefasto his
  sword."</p>

  <p>"However," warned the other, "be careful of Zuanthrol," and he
  departed.</p>

  <p>Kalfastoban Vental set the new slave to work upon the timbering of the
  tunnel as it was excavated from the great moraine that formed the quarry. The
  line of slaves coming from the surface empty-handed passed down one side of
  the tunnel to the end, loosened each a rock, or if heavy a rock to two men,
  and turned back up the tunnel's opposite side, carrying their burdens back to
  the spiral runway used by those leaving the workings and so up and out to the
  new dome. The earth, a light clay, that filled the interstices between the
  rocks in the moraine was tamped into the opening behind the wall timbers, the
  tunnel being purposely made sufficiently large to permit this. Certain slaves
  were detailed for this work, others carried timbers cut to the right
  dimensions down to the timbering crew, of which Tarzan was one. It was only
  necessary for this crew of three to scoop a narrow, shallow trench in which
  to place the foot of each wall board, set them in place and slip the ceiling
  board on top of them. At each end of the ceiling boards was a cleat,
  previously attached at the surface, which kept the wall boards from falling
  in after being set in place. The dirt tamped behind them fastened them
  solidly in their places, the whole making a quickly erected and substantial
  shoring.</p>

  <p>The work was light for the ape-man, though he still was weak from the
  effects of his wounds, and he had opportunities constantly to observe all
  that went on around him and to gather new information relative to the people
  in whose power he found himself. Kalfastoban he soon set down as a
  loudmouthed braggart, from whom one need have nothing to fear during the
  routine of their everyday work, but who would bear watching if ever
  opportunity came for him to make a show of authority or physical prowess
  before the eyes of his superiors.</p>

  <p>The slaves about him worked steadily, but seemed not to be overtaxed,
  while the guards, which accompanied them constantly, in the ratio of about
  one warrior to every fifty slaves, gave no indications of brutality in the
  treatment they accorded their charges, insofar as Tarzan was able to
  observe.</p><a id="pic21"

    <p class="caption">The slaves in the quarries worked steadily.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The fact that puzzled him most now as it had since the moment of his first
  return to consciousness, was the stature of these people. They were no
  pygmies, but men fully as large as the usual run of Europeans. There was none
  quite as tall as the ape-man, but there were many who missed it by but the
  scantiest fraction of an inch. He knew that they were Veltopismakusians, the
  same people he had seen battling with the Trohanadalmakusians; they spoke of
  having captured him in the battle that he had seen waged; and they called him
  Zuanthrol, The Giant, yet they were as large as he, and as he had passed from
  the Royal Dome to the quarry he had seen their gigantic dome dwellings rising
  fully four hundred feet above his head. It was all preposterous and
  impossible, yet he had the testimony of all his faculties that it was true.
  Contemplation of it but tended to confuse him more and so he gave over all
  attempts to solve the mystery and set himself to the gathering of information
  concerning his captors and his prison against that time which he well knew
  must some day come when the means of escape should offer itself to the alert
  and cunning instincts of the wild beast that, at heart, he always considered
  himself.</p>

  <p>Wherever he had been in Veltopismakus, whoever he had heard refer to the
  subject, he had had it borne in upon him that the people were generally
  dissatisfied with their king and his government, and he knew that among a
  discontented people efficiency would be at low ebb and discipline demoralized
  to such an extent that, should he watch carefully, he must eventually
  discover the opportunity he sought, through the laxity of those responsible
  for his safekeeping. He did not expect it today or tomorrow, but today and
  tomorrow were the days upon which to lay the foundation of observation that
  would eventually reveal an avenue of escape.</p>

  <p>When the long working day at last drew to a close the slaves were
  conducted to their quarters, which, as Tarzan discovered, were always on
  levels near to those in which they labored. He, with several other slaves,
  was conducted to the thirty-fifth level and into a tunnel the far end of
  which had been widened to the proportions of a large chamber, the narrow
  entrance to which had been walled up with stone except for a small aperture
  through which the slaves were forced to pass in and out of their chamber upon
  all fours, and when the last of them was within, this was closed and secured
  by a heavy door outside which two warriors watched throughout the night.</p>

  <p>Once inside and standing upon his feet the ape-man looked about him to
  discover himself within a chamber so large that it seemed easy to accommodate
  the great throng of slaves that must have numbered fully five thousand souls
  of both sexes. The women were preparing food over small fires the smoke of
  which found its way from the chamber through openings in the ceiling. For the
  great number of fires the amount of smoke was noticeably little, a fact which
  was, however, accounted for by the nature of the fuel, a clean, hard
  charcoal; but why the liberated gases did not asphyxiate them all was quite
  beyond the ape-man, as was still the riddle of the open flames and the pure
  air at the depth where the workings lay. Candles burned in niches all about
  the walls and there were at least half-a-dozen large ones standing upon the
  floor.</p>

  <p>The slaves were of all ages from infancy to middle age, but there were no
  aged venerables among them. The skins of the women and children were the
  whitest Tarzan had ever seen and he marveled at them until he came to know
  that some of the former and all of the latter had never seen daylight since
  birth. The children who were born here would go up into the daylight some
  time, when they were of an age that warranted beginning the training for the
  vocations their masters had chosen for them, but the women who had been
  captured from other cities would remain here until death claimed them, unless
  that rarest of miracles occurred&mdash;they should be chosen by a
  Veltopismakusian warrior as his mate; but that was scarce even a remote
  possibility, since the warriors almost invariably chose their mates from the
  slaves of the white tunic with whom they came in daily contact in the domes
  above ground.</p>

  <p>The faces of the women bore the imprint of a sadness that brought a
  spontaneous surge of sympathy to the breast of the savage ape-man. Never in
  his life had he seen such abject hopelessness depicted upon any face.</p>

  <p>As he crossed the room many were the glances that were cast upon him, for
  it was obvious from his deep tan that he was a newcomer, and, too, there was
  that about him that marked him of different clay from them, and soon there
  were whispers running through the throng, for the slaves who had entered with
  him had passed the word of his identity to the others, and who, even in the
  bowels of the earth, had not heard of the wondrous giant captured by
  Zoanthrohago during the battle with the Trohanadalmakusians?</p>

  <p>Presently a young girl, kneeling above a brazier over which she was
  grilling a cut of flesh, caught his eye and motioned him to her. As he came
  he saw that she was very beautiful, with a pale, translucent skin the
  whiteness of which was accentuated by the blue-black of a wealth of lustrous
  hair.</p>

  <p>"You are The Giant?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am Zuanthrol," he replied.</p>

  <p>"He has told me about you," said the girl. "I will cook for you, too. I
  cook for him. Unless," she added with a trace of embarrassment, "there is
  another you would rather have cook for you."</p>

  <p>"There is no one I would rather have cook for me," Tarzan told her; "but
  who are you and who is <i>he</i>?"</p>

  <p>"I am Talaskar," she replied; "but I know him only by his number. He says
  that while he remains a slave he has no name, but will go always by his
  number, which is Eight Hundred Cubed, Plus Nineteen. I see that you are Eight
  Hundred Cubed, Plus Twenty-one." She was looking at the hieroglyphics that
  had been fastened upon his shoulder. "Have you a name?"</p>

  <p>"They call me Zuanthrol."</p>

  <p>"Ah," she said, "you are a large man, but I should scarcely call you a
  giant. He, too, is from Trohanadalmakus and he is about your height. I never
  heard that there were any giants in Minuni except the people they call
  Zertalacolols."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were a Zertalacolol," said a man's voice at Tarzan's
  ear.</p>

  <p>The ape-man turned to see one of the slaves with whom he had been working
  eyeing him quizzically, and smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am a Zertalacolol to my masters," he replied.</p>

  <p>The other raised his brows. "I see," he said. "Perhaps you are wise. I
  shall not be the one to betray you," and passed on about his business.</p>

  <p>"What did he mean?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"I have never spoken, until now, since they took me prisoner," he
  explained, "and they think I am speechless, though I am sure that I do not
  look like a Zertalacolol, yet some of them insist that I am one."</p>

  <p>"I have never seen one," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"You are fortunate," Tarzan told her. "They are neither pleasant to see
  nor to meet."</p>

  <p>"But I should like to see them," she insisted. "I should like to see
  anything that was different from these slaves whom I see all day and every
  day."</p>

  <p>"Do not lose hope," he encouraged her, "for who knows but that it may be
  very soon that you will return to the surface."</p>

  <p>"Return," she repeated. "I have never been there."</p>

  <p>"Never been to the surface! You mean since you were captured."</p>

  <p>"I was born in this chamber," she told him, "and never have I been out of
  it."</p>

  <p>"You are a slave of the second generation and are still confined to the
  quarries&mdash;I do not understand it. In all Minunian cities, I have been
  told, slaves of the second generation are given the white tunic and
  comparative freedom above ground."</p>

  <p>"It was not for me. My mother would not permit it. She would rather I had
  died than mated with a Veltopismakusian or another slave, as I must do if I
  go into the city above."</p>

  <p>"But how do you avoid it? Your masters certainly do not leave such things
  to the discretion of their slaves."</p>

  <p>"Where there are so many one or two may go unaccounted for indefinitely,
  and women, if they be ill-favored, cause no comment upon the part of our
  masters. My birth was never reported and so they have no record of me. My
  mother took a number for me from the tunic of one who died, and in this way I
  attract no attention upon the few occasions that our masters or the warriors
  enter our chamber."</p>

  <p>"But you are not ill-favored&mdash;your face would surely attract
  attention anywhere," Tarzan reminded her.</p>

  <p>For just an instant she turned her back upon him, putting her hands to her
  face and to her hair, and then she faced him again and the ape-man saw before
  him a hideous and wrinkled hag upon whose crooked features no man would look
  a second time.</p>

  <p>"God!" ejaculated Tarzan.</p>

  <p>Slowly the girl's face relaxed, assuming its normal lines of beauty, and
  with quick, deft touches she arranged her disheveled hair. An expression that
  was almost a smile haunted her lips.</p>

  <p>"My mother taught me this," she said, "so that when they came and looked
  upon me they would not want me."</p>

  <p>"But would it not be better to be mated with one of them and live a life
  of comfort above ground than to eke out a terrible existence below ground?"
  he demanded. "The warriors of Veltopismakus are, doubtless, but little
  different from those of your own country."</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "It cannot be, for me," she said. "My father is of far
  Mandalamakus. My mother was stolen from him but a couple of moons before I
  was born in this horrid chamber, far from the air and sunlight that my mother
  never tired of telling me about."</p>

  <p>"And your mother?" asked Tarzan. "Is she here?"</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head sadly. "They came for her over twenty moons since
  and took her away. I do not know what became of her."</p>

  <p>"And these others, they never betray you?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Never! Whatever slave betrayed another would be torn to pieces by his
  fellows. But come, you must be hungry," and she offered him of the flesh she
  had been cooking.</p>

  <p>Tarzan would have preferred his meat raw, but he did not wish to offend
  her and so he thanked her and ate that which she offered him, squatting on
  his haunches across the brazier from her.</p>

  <p>"It is strange that Aoponato does not come," she remarked, using the
  Minunian form of Eight Hundred Cubed, Plus Nineteen. "Never before has he
  been so late."</p>

  <p>A brawny slave, who had approached from behind her, had halted and was
  looking scowlingly at Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps this is he," said Tarzan to the girl, indicating the man with a
  gesture.</p>

  <p>Talaskar turned quickly, an almost happy light in her eyes, but when she
  saw who it was that stood behind her she rose quickly and stepped back, her
  expression altered to one of disgust.</p>

  <p>"No," she said, "it is not he."</p>

  <p>"You are cooking for him?" demanded the fellow, pointing at Tarzan. "But
  you would not cook for me," he accused, not waiting for a reply to his
  question, the answer to which was all too obvious. "Who is he that you should
  cook for him? Is he better than I? You will cook for me, also."</p>

  <p>"There are plenty to cook for you, Caraftap," replied Talaskar, "and I do
  not wish to. Go to some other woman. Until there are too many men we are
  permitted to choose those whom we shall cook for. I do not choose to cook for
  you."</p>

  <p>"If you know what is well for you, you will cook for me," growled the man.
  "You will be my mate, too. I have a right to you, because I have asked you
  many times before these others came. Rather than let them have you I will
  tell the Vental tomorrow the truth about you and he will take you away. Have
  you ever seen Kalfastoban?"</p>

  <p>The girl shuddered.</p>

  <p>"I will see that Kalfastoban gets you," continued Caraftap. "They will not
  permit you to remain here when they find that you refuse to produce more
  slaves."</p>

  <p>"I should prefer Kalfastoban to you," sneered the girl, "but neither one
  nor the other shall have me."</p>

  <p>"Do not be too sure of that," he cried, and stepping forward, quickly,
  seized her by the arm before she could elude him. Dragging her toward him the
  man attempted to kiss her&mdash;but he did not succeed. Steel fingers closed
  upon his shoulder, he was torn roughly from his prey and hurled ruthlessly a
  dozen paces, stumbling and falling to the floor. Between him and the girl
  stood the gray-eyed stranger with the shock of black hair.</p>

  <p>Almost roaring in his rage, Caraftap scrambled to his feet and charged
  Tarzan&mdash;charged as a mad bull charges, with lowered head and bloodshot
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"For this you shall die," he screamed.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE Son of The First Woman strode proudly through the
  forest. He carried a spear, jauntily, and there were a bow and arrows slung
  to his back. Behind him came ten other males of his species, similarly armed,
  and each walked as though he owned the earth he trod. Toward them along the
  trail, though still beyond their sight, or hearing, or smell, came a woman of
  their kind. She, too, walked with fearless step. Presently her eyes narrowed
  and she paused, up-pricking her great, flat ears to listen, sniffing the air.
  Men! She increased her gait to a trot, bearing down upon them. There was more
  than one&mdash;there were several. If she came upon them suddenly they would
  be startled, filled with confusion, and no doubt she could seize one of them
  before they took to flight. If not&mdash;the feathered pebbles at her girdle
  would seek one out.</p><a id="pic22"
        name="pic22"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">She increased her gait to a trot.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>For some time men had been scarce. Many women of her tribe who had gone
  out into the forest to capture mates had never returned. She had seen the
  corpses of several of these herself, lying in the forest. She had wondered
  what had killed them. But here were men at last, the first she had discovered
  in two moons, and this time she would not return empty-handed to her
  cave.</p>

  <p>At a sudden turning of the forest trail she came within sight of them, but
  saw, to her dismay, that they were still a long way off. They would be sure
  to escape if they saw her, and she was upon the point of hiding when she
  realized that already it was too late. One of them was pointing at her.
  Loosing a missile from her girdle and grasping her cudgel more firmly she
  started toward them at a rapid, lumbering run. She was both surprised and
  pleased when she saw that they made no attempt to escape. How terrified they
  must be to stand thus docilely while she approached them. But what was this?
  They were advancing to meet her! And now she saw the expressions upon their
  faces. No fear there&mdash;only rage and menace. What were the strange things
  they carried in their hands? One who was running toward her, the nearest,
  paused and hurled a long pointed stick at her. It was sharp and when it
  grazed her shoulder it brought blood. Another paused and holding a little
  stick across a longer stick, the ends of which were bent back with a piece of
  gut, suddenly released the smaller stick, which leaped through the air and
  pierced the flesh beneath one of her arms. And behind these two the others
  were rushing upon her with similar weapons. She recalled the corpses of women
  she had seen in the forest and the dearth of men for the past several moons,
  and though she was dull of wit yet she was not without reasoning faculties
  and so she compared these facts with the occurrences of the past few seconds
  with a resultant judgment that sent her lumbering away, in the direction from
  which she had come, as fast as her hairy legs could carry her, nor did she
  once pause in her mad flight until she sank exhausted at the mouth of her own
  cave.</p>

  <p>The men did not pursue her. As yet they had not reached that stage in
  their emancipation that was to give them sufficient courage and confidence in
  themselves to entirely overcome their hereditary fear of women. To chase one
  away was sufficient. To pursue her would have been tempting Providence.</p>

  <p>When the other women of the tribe saw their fellow stagger to her cave and
  sensed that her condition was the result of terror and the physical strain of
  long flight they seized their cudgels and ran forth, prepared to meet and
  vanquish her pursuer, which they immediately assumed to be a lion. But no
  lion appeared and then some of them wandered to the side of the woman who lay
  panting on her threshold.</p>

  <p>"From what did you run?" they asked her in their simple sign language.</p>

  <p>"Men," she replied.</p>

  <p>Disgust showed plainly upon every face, and one of them kicked her and
  another spat upon her.</p>

  <p>"There were many," she told them, "and they would have killed me with
  flying sticks. Look!" and she showed them the spear wound, and the arrow
  still embedded in the flesh beneath her arm. "They did not run from me, but
  came forward to attack me. Thus have all the women been killed whose corpses
  we have seen in the forest during the past few moons."</p>

  <p>This troubled them. They ceased to annoy the prostrate woman. Their
  leader, the fiercest of them, paced to and fro, making hideous faces.
  Suddenly she halted.</p>

  <p>"Come!" she signaled. "We shall go forth together and find these men, and
  bring them back and punish them." She shook her cudgel above her head and
  grimaced horribly.</p>

  <p>The others danced about her, imitating her expression and her actions, and
  when she started off toward the forest they trooped behind her, a savage,
  bloodthirsty company&mdash;all but the woman who still lay panting where she
  had fallen. She had had enough of man&mdash;she was through with him
  forever.</p>

  <p><br>
  "FOR this you shall die!" screamed Caraftap, as he rushed upon Tarzan of the
  Apes in the long gallery of the slaves' quarters in the quarry of
  Elkomeolhago, king of Veltopismakus.</p>

  <p>The ape-man stepped quickly aside, avoiding the other, and tripped him
  with a foot, sending him sprawling, face downward, upon the floor. Caraftap,
  before he arose, looked about as though in search of a weapon and, his eyes
  alighting upon the hot brazier, he reached forth to seize it. A murmur of
  disapproval rose from the slaves who, having been occupied nearby, had seen
  the inception of the quarrel.</p>

  <p>"No weapons!" cried one. "It is not permitted among us. Fight with your
  bare hands or not at all."</p>

  <p>But Caraftap was too drunk with hate and jealousy to hear them or to heed,
  and so he grasped the brazier and, rising, rushed at Tarzan to hurl it in his
  face. Now it was another who tripped him and this time two slaves leaped upon
  him and wrenched the brazier from his hand. "Fight fair!" they admonished
  him, and dragged him to his feet.</p>

  <p>Tarzan had stood smiling and indifferent, for the rage of others amused
  him where it was greater than circumstances warranted, and now he waited for
  Caraftap and when his adversary saw the smile upon his face it but increased
  his spleen, so that he fairly leaped upon the ape-man in his madness to
  destroy him, and Tarzan met him with the most surprising defense that
  Caraftap, who for long had been a bully among the slaves, ever had
  encountered. It was a doubled fist at the end of a straight arm and it caught
  Caraftap upon the point of his chin, stretching him upon his back. The
  slaves, who had by this time gathered in considerable numbers to watch the
  quarrel, voiced their approval in the shrill, "Ee-ah-ee-ah," that constituted
  one form of applause.</p>

  <p>Dazed and groggy, Caraftap staggered to his feet once more and with
  lowered head looked about him as though in search of his enemy. The girl,
  Talaskar, had come to Tarzan's side and was standing there looking up into
  his face.</p>

  <p>"You are very strong," she said, but the expression in her eyes said more,
  or at least it seemed to Caraftap to say more. It seemed to speak of love,
  whereas it was only the admiration that a normal woman always feels for
  strength exercised in a worthy cause.</p>

  <p>Caraftap made a noise in his throat that sounded much like the squeal of
  an angry pig and once again he rushed upon the ape-man. Behind them some
  slaves were being let into the corridor and as the aperture was open one of
  the warriors beyond it, who chanced to be stooping down at the time, could
  see within. He saw but little, though what he saw was enough&mdash;a large
  slave with a shock of black hair raising another large slave high above his
  head and dashing him to the hard floor. The warrior, pushing the slaves
  aside, scrambled through into the corridor and ran forward toward the center.
  Before they were aware of his presence he stood facing Tarzan and Talaskar.
  It was Kalfastoban.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this?" he cried in a loud voice, and then: "Ah,
  ha! I see. It is The Giant. He would show the other slaves how strong he is,
  would he?" He glanced at Caraftap, struggling to rise from the floor, and his
  face grew very dark&mdash;Caraftap was a favorite of his. "Such things are
  not permitted here, fellow!" he cried, shaking his fist in the ape-man's
  face, and forgetting in his anger that the new slave neither spoke nor
  understood. But presently he recollected and motioned Tarzan to follow him.
  "A hundred lashes will explain to him that he must not quarrel," he said
  aloud to no one in particular, but he was looking at Talaskar.</p>

  <p>"Do not punish him," cried the girl, still forgetful of herself. "It was
  all Caraftap's fault, Zuanthrol but acted in self-defense."</p>

  <p>Kalfastoban could not take his eyes from the girl's face and presently she
  sensed her danger and flushed, but still she stood her ground, interceding
  for the ape-man. A crooked smile twisted Kalfastoban's mouth as he laid a
  familiar hand upon her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"How old are you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She told him, shuddering.</p>

  <p>"I shall see your master and purchase you," he announced. "Take no
  mate."</p>

  <p>Tarzan was looking at Talaskar and it seemed that he could see her wilt,
  as a flower wilts in noxious air, and then Kalfastoban turned upon him.</p>

  <p>"You cannot understand me, you stupid beast," he said, "but I can tell
  you, and those around you may listen and, perhaps, guide you from danger.
  This time I shall let you off, but let it happen again and you shall have a
  hundred lashes, or worse, maybe; and if I hear that you have had aught to do
  with this girl, whom I intend to purchase and take to the surface, it will go
  still harder with you," with which he strode to the entrance and passed
  through into the corridor beyond.</p>

  <p>After the Vental had departed and the door of the chamber had been closed
  a hand was laid upon Tarzan's shoulder from behind and a man's voice called
  him by name: "Tarzan!" It sounded strange in his ears, far down in this
  buried chamber beneath the ground, in an alien city and among an alien
  people, not one of whom ever had heard his name, but as he turned to face the
  man who had greeted him a look of recognition and a smile of pleasure
  overspread his features.</p>

  <p>"Kom&mdash;!" he started to ejaculate, but the other placed a finger to
  his lips. "Not here," he said. "Here I am Aoponato."</p>

  <p>"But your stature! You are as large as I. It is beyond me. What has
  happened to swell the race of Minunians to such relatively gigantic
  proportions?"</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal smiled. "Human egotism would not permit you to attribute
  this change to an opposite cause from that to which you have ascribed it," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Tarzan knit his brows and gazed long and thoughtfully at his royal friend.
  An expression that was of mingled incredulity and amusement crept gradually
  over his countenance.</p>

  <p>"You mean," he asked slowly, "that I have been reduced in size to the
  stature of a Minunian?"</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal nodded. "Is it not easier to believe that than to think
  that an entire race of people and all their belongings, even their dwellings
  and the stones that they were built of, and all their weapons and their
  diadets, had been increased in size to your own stature?"</p>

  <p>"But I tell you it is impossible!" cried the ape-man.</p>

  <p>"I should have said the same thing a few moons ago," replied the prince.
  "Even when I heard the rumor here that they had reduced you I did not believe
  it, not for a long time, and I was still a bit skeptical until I entered this
  chamber and saw you with my own eyes."</p>

  <p>"How was it accomplished?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"The greatest mind in Veltopismakus, and perhaps in all Minuni, is
  Zoanthrohago," explained Komodoflorensal. "We have recognized this for many
  moons, for, during the occasional intervals that we are at peace with
  Veltopismakus, there is some exchange of ideas as well as goods between the
  two cities, and thus we heard of many marvels attributed to this greatest of
  walmaks."</p>

  <p>"I have never heard a wizard spoken of in Minuni until now," said Tarzan,
  for he thought that that was the meaning of the word walmak, and perhaps it
  is, as nearly as it can be translated into English. A scientist who works
  miracles would be, perhaps, a truer definition.</p>

  <p>"It was Zoanthrohago who captured you," continued Aoponato, "encompassing
  your fall by means at once scientific and miraculous. After you had fallen he
  caused you to lose consciousness and while you were in that condition you
  were dragged hither by a score of diadets hitched to a hastily improvised
  litter built of small trees tied securely one to the other, after their
  branches had been removed. It was after they had you safely within
  Veltopismakus that Zoanthrohago set to work upon you to reduce your stature,
  using apparatus that he has built himself. I have heard them discussing it
  and they say that it did not take him long."</p>

  <p>"I hope that Zoanthrohago has the power to undo that which he has done,"
  said the ape-man.</p>

  <p>"They say that that is doubtful. He has never been able to make a creature
  larger than it formerly was, though in his numerous experiments he has
  reduced the size of many of the lower animals. The fact of the matter is,"
  continued Aoponato, "that he has been searching for a means to enlarge the
  Veltopismakusians so that they may overcome all the other peoples of Minuni,
  but he has only succeeded in developing a method that gives precisely
  opposite results from that which they seek, so, if he cannot make others
  larger, I doubt if he can make you any larger than you now are."</p>

  <p>"I would be rather helpless among the enemies of my own world," said
  Tarzan, ruefully.</p>

  <p>"You need not worry about that, my friend," said the prince gently.</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked the ape-man.</p>

  <p>"Because you have very little chance of reaching your own world again,"
  said Komodoflorensal a trifle sadly. "I have no hope of ever seeing
  Trohanadalmakus again. Only by the utter overthrow of Veltopismakus by my
  father's warriors could I hope for rescue, since nothing less could overcome
  the guard in the quarry mouth. While we often capture slaves of the white
  tunic from the enemies' cities, it is seldom that we gather in any of the
  green tunic. Only in the rare cases of utter surprise attacks by daylight do
  any of us catch an enemies' green slaves above ground, and surprise day
  attacks may occur once in the lifetime of a man, or never."</p>

  <p>"You believe that we will spend the rest of our lives in this underground
  hole?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"Unless we chance to be used for labor above ground during the daytime,
  occasionally," replied the prince of Trohanadalmakus, with a wry smile.</p>

  <p>The ape-man shrugged. "We shall see," he said.</p>

  <p>After Kalfastoban had left, Caraftap had limped away to the far end of the
  chamber, muttering to himself, his ugly face black and scowling.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that he will make you trouble," Talaskar said to Tarzan,
  indicating the disgruntled slave with a nod of her shapely head, "and I am
  sorry, for it is all my fault."</p>

  <p>"Your fault?" demanded Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the girl. "Caraftap was threatening me when Aopontando
  interfered and punished him."</p>

  <p>"Aopontando?" queried Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"That is my number," explained Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"And it was on account of Talaskar that you were fighting? I thank you, my
  friend. I am sorry that I was not here to protect her. Talaskar cooks for me.
  She is a good girl." Komodoflorensal was looking at the girl as he spoke and
  Tarzan saw how her eyes lowered beneath his gaze and the delicate flush that
  mounted her cheeks, and he realized that he was downwind from an idea, and
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"So this is the Aoponato of whom you told me?" he said to Talaskar.</p>

  <p>"Yes, this is he."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that he was captured, but it is good to find a friend here,"
  said the ape-man. "We three should be able to hit upon some plan of escape,"
  but they shook their heads, smiling sadly.</p>

  <p>For a while, after they had eaten, they sat talking together, being joined
  occasionally by other slaves, for Tarzan had many friends here now since he
  had chastised Caraftap and they would have talked all night had not the
  ape-man questioned Komodoflorensal as to the sleeping arrangements of the
  slaves.</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal laughed, and pointed here and there about the chamber at
  recumbent figures lying upon the hard earthen floor; men, women and children
  sleeping, for the most part, where they had eaten their evening meal.</p>

  <p>"The green slaves are not pampered," he remarked laconically.</p>

  <p>"I can sleep anywhere," said Tarzan, "but more easily when it is dark. I
  shall wait until the lights are extinguished."</p>

  <p>"You will wait forever, then," Komodoflorensal told him.</p>

  <p>"The lights are never extinguished?" demanded the ape-man.</p>

  <p>"Were they, we should all be soon dead," replied the prince. "These flames
  serve two purposes&mdash;they dissipate the darkness and consume the foul
  gases that would otherwise quickly asphyxiate us. Unlike the ordinary flame,
  that consumes oxygen, these candles, perfected from the discoveries and
  inventions of an ancient Minunian scientist, consume the deadly gases and
  liberate oxygen. It is because of this even more than for the light they give
  that they are used exclusively throughout Minuni. Even our domes would be
  dark, ill-smelling, noxious places were it not for them, while the quarries
  would be absolutely unworkable."</p>

  <p>"Then I shall not wait for them to be extinguished," said Tarzan,
  stretching himself at full length upon the dirt floor, with a nod and a
  "Tuano!"&mdash;a Minunian "Good night!"&mdash;to Talaskar and
  Komodoflorensal.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS Talaskar was preparing their breakfast the following
  morning Komodoflorensal remarked to Tarzan that he wished they two could be
  employed upon the same work, that they might be always together.</p>

  <p>"If there is ever the chance for escape that you seem to think will some
  day present itself," he said, "then it will be well if we are together."</p>

  <p>"When we go," replied Tarzan, "we must take Talaskar with us."</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal shot a swift glance at the ape-man, but made no comment
  upon his suggestion.</p>

  <p>"You would take me with you!" exclaimed Talaskar. "Ah, if such a dream
  could but be realized! I would go with you to Trohanadalmakus and be your
  slave, for I know that you would not harm me; but, alas, it can be nothing
  more than a pleasant daydream, enduring for a brief time, for Kalfastoban has
  spoken for me and doubtless my master will be glad to sell me to him, for I
  have heard it said among the slaves that he sells many of his each year to
  raise the money to pay his taxes."</p>

  <p>"We will do what we can, Talaskar," said Tarzan, "and if Aoponato and I
  find a means of escape we will take you with us; but first he and I must find
  a way to be together more."</p>

  <p>"I have a plan," said Komodoflorensal, "that might prove successful. They
  believe that you neither speak nor understand our language. To work a slave
  with whom they cannot communicate is, to say the least, annoying. I shall
  tell them that I can communicate with you, when it is quite probable that
  they will assign us to the same crew."</p>

  <p>"But how will you communicate with me without using the Minunian
  language?" demanded the ape-man.</p>

  <p>"Leave that to me," replied Komodoflorensal. "Until they discover in some
  other way that you speak Minunian I can continue to deceive them."</p>

  <p>It was not long before the fruits of Komodoflorensal's plan ripened. The
  guards had come for the slaves and the various parties had gone forth from
  the sleeping chamber, joining in the corridors without the thousands of others
  wending their way to the scene of their daily labor. The ape-man joined the
  timbering crew at the extension of the thirteenth tunnel at the thirty-sixth
  level where he once more attacked the monotonous work of shoring the sides
  and roof of the shaft with an enthusiasm that elicited commendation from even
  the surly Kalfastoban, though Caraftap, who was removing rocks just ahead of
  Tarzan, often shot venomous looks at the ape-man.</p>

  <p>The work had been progressing for perhaps two or three hours when two
  warriors descended the tunnel and halted beside Kalfastoban. They were
  escorting a green-tunicked slave, to whom Tarzan paid no more attention than
  he did to the warriors until a scrap of the conversation between the warriors
  and Kalfastoban reached his ears, then he shot a quick glance in the
  direction of the four and saw that the slave was Komodoflorensal, Prince of
  Trohanadalmakus, known in the quarries of Veltopismakus as Slave Aoponato, or
  800<sup>3</sup>+19, which is written in Minunian hieroglyphics.
  <sub><img src="0600651h-images/TarzanAndTheAntMen-H1.png" alt="" title=""></sub></p>

  <p>Tarzan's number Aopontando, 800<sup>3</sup>+21, appeared thus, upon the shoulder of
  his green tunic.  <sub><img src="0600651h-images/TarzanAndTheAntMen-H2.png"
  alt=""  title=""></sub></p>

  <p>Although the Minunian form occupies less space than would our English
  equivalent of Tarzan's number, which is 512,000,021, it would be more
  difficult to read if expressed in English words, for it then would be, ten
  times ten times eight, cubed, plus seven times three; but the Minunians
  translate it in no such way. To them it is a whole number, Aopontando, which
  represents at first glance a single quantity as surely as do the digits 37
  represent to our minds an invariable amount, a certain, definite measure of
  quantity which we never think of as three times ten plus seven, which, in
  reality, it is. The Minunian system of numerals, while unthinkably cumbersome
  and awkward from the European point of view, is, however, not without its
  merits.</p>

  <p><br>
  As Tarzan looked up Komodoflorensal caught his eye and winked and then
  Kalfastoban beckoned to the ape-man, who crossed the corridor and stood in
  silence before the Vental.</p>

  <p>"Let us hear you talk to him," cried Kalfastoban to Komodoflorensal. "I
  don't believe that he will understand you. How could he when he cannot
  understand us?" The fellow could not conceive of another language than his
  own.</p>

  <p>"I will ask him in his own language," said Komodoflorensal, "if he
  understands me, and you will see that he nods his head affirmatively."</p>

  <p>"Very good," cried Kalfastoban; "ask him."</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal turned toward Tarzan and voiced a dozen syllables of
  incomprehensible gibberish and when he was done the ape-man nodded his
  head.</p>

  <p>"You see," demanded Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>Kalfastoban scratched his head. "It is even as he says," he admitted,
  ruefully, "the Zertalacolol has a language."</p>

  <p>Tarzan did not smile, though he should have liked to, at the clever manner
  in which Komodoflorensal had deceived the Veltopismakusians into believing
  that he had communicated with Tarzan in a strange language. As long as he
  could contrive to put all his communications into questions that could be
  answered by yes or no, the deception would be easily maintained; but under
  circumstances that made this impossible some embarrassments might be expected
  to arise, and he wondered how the resourceful Trohanadalmakusian would handle
  these.</p>

  <p>"Tell him," said one of the warriors to Komodoflorensal, "that his master,
  Zoanthrohago, has sent for him, and ask him if he fully understands that he
  is a slave and that upon his good behavior depends his comfort; yes, even his
  life, for Zoanthrohago has the power of life and death over him; as much so
  as have the royal family. If he comes docilely to his master and is obedient
  he will not fare ill, but if he be lazy, impudent, or threatening he may
  expect to taste the point of a freeman's sword."</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal strung out, this time, a much longer series of senseless
  syllables, until he could scarce compose his features to comport with the
  seriousness of his mien.</p>

  <p>"Tell them," said Tarzan, in English, which, of course, not one of them
  understood, "that at the first opportunity I shall break the neck of my
  master; that it would require but little incentive to cause me to seize one
  of these timbers and crack the skull of Kalfastoban and the rest of the
  warriors about us; and I shall run away at the first opportunity and take you
  and Talaskar with me."</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal listened intently until Tarzan had ceased speaking and
  then turned to the two warriors who had come with him to find the
  ape-man.</p>

  <p>"Zuanthrol says that he fully understands his position and that he is glad
  to serve the noble and illustrious Zoanthrohago, from whom he claims but a
  single boon," translated the Trohanadalmakusian prince, rather freely.</p>

  <p>"And what boon is that?" demanded one of the warriors.</p>

  <p>"That I be permitted to accompany him that he may thus better fulfill the
  wishes of his master, since without me he could not even know what was
  desired of him," explained Aoponato.</p>

  <p>Tarzan understood now how Komodoflorensal would surmount whatever
  difficulties of communication might arise and he felt that he would be safe
  in the hands of his quick-witted friend for as long a time as he cared to
  pretend ignorance of the Minunian tongue.</p>

  <p>"The thought was even in our minds, slave, when we heard that you could
  communicate with this fellow," said the warrior to whom Komodoflorensal had
  addressed the suggestion. "You shall both be taken to Zoanthrohago, who will
  doubtless decide his wishes without consulting you or any other slave. Come!
  Kalfastoban Vental, we assume responsibility for the Slave Zuanthrol," and
  they handed the Vental a slip of paper upon which they had marked some
  curious hieroglyphics.</p>

  <p>Then, with swords drawn, they motioned Komodoflorensal and Tarzan to
  precede them along the corridor, for the story of Tarzan's handling of
  Caraftap had reached even to the guard room of the quarry, and these warriors
  were taking no chances.</p>

  <p>The way led through a straight corridor and up a winding spiral runway to
  the surface, where Tarzan greeted the sunlight and the fresh air almost with
  a sob of gratitude, for to be shut away from them for even a brief day was to
  the ape-man cruel punishment, indeed. Here he saw again the vast, endless
  multitude of slaves bearing their heavy burdens to and fro, the trim warriors
  who paced haughtily upon either flank of the long lines of toiling serfs, the
  richly trapped nobles of the higher castes and the innumerable white-tunicked
  slaves who darted hither and thither upon the errands of their masters, or
  upon their own business or pleasure, for many of these had a certain freedom
  and independence that gave them almost the standing of freemen. Always were
  these slaves of the white tunic owned by a master, but, especially in the
  case of skilled artisans, about the only allegiance they owed to this master
  was to pay to him a certain percentage of their incomes. They constituted the
  bourgeoisie of Minuni and also the higher caste serving class. Unlike the
  green-tunicked slaves, no guard was placed over them to prevent their escape,
  since there was no danger that they would attempt to escape, there being no
  city in Minuni where their estate would be improved, for any other city than
  that of their birth would treat them as alien prisoners, reducing them
  immediately to the green tunic and lifelong hard labor.</p>

  <p>The domes of Veltopismakus were as imposing as those of Trohanadalmakus.
  In fact, to Tarzan, they appeared infinitely larger since he now was
  one-fourth the size he had been when he had left Trohanadalmakus. There were
  eight of them fully occupied and another in course of construction, for the
  surface population of Veltopismakus was already four hundred and eighty
  thousand souls, and as overcrowding was not permitted in the king's dome the
  remaining seven were packed densely with humanity.</p>

  <p>It was to the royal dome that Tarzan and Komodoflorensal were conducted,
  but they did not enter by way of the King's Corridor, before the gates of
  which fluttered the white and gold of the royal standards. Instead they were
  escorted to the Warrior's Corridor, which opens toward the west. Unlike the
  city of Trohanadalmakus, Veltopismakus was beautiful in the areas between the
  domes with flowers and shrubbery and trees, among which wound graveled walks
  and broad roadways. The royal dome faced upon a large parade where a body of
  mounted warriors was at drill. There were a thousand of them, forming an
  amak, consisting of four novands of two hundred fifty men each, the larger
  body being commanded by a kamak and the smaller by a novand. Five entex of
  fifty men each compose a novand, there being five entals of ten men each to
  an entex; these latter units commanded by a Vental and a Ventex,
  respectively. The evolutions of the amak were performed with kaleidoscopic
  rapidity, so quick upon their feet and so well trained were the tiny diadets.
  There was one evolution in particular, performed while he was passing, that
  greatly interested the ape-man. Two novands formed line at one end of the
  parade and two at the other and at the command of the kamak the thousand men
  charged swiftly down the field in two solid ranks that approached one another
  with the speed of an express train. Just when it seemed impossible that a
  serious accident could be averted, when it seemed that in another instant
  diadets and riders must crash together in a bloody jumble of broken bones,
  the warriors rushing so swiftly toward the east raised their agile mounts,
  which fairly flew above the heads of the opposing force and alighting upon
  the other side in an unbroken line continued to the far end of the field.</p>

  <p>Tarzan was commenting on this maneuver and upon the beauties of the
  landscaping of the city of Veltopismakus to Komodoflorensal as they proceeded
  along the Warrior's Corridor, sufficiently ahead of their escort that Tarzan
  might speak in a low tone without the guard being cognizant of the fact that
  he was using the language of Minuni.</p>

  <p>"It is a beautiful evolution," replied Komodoflorensal, "and it was
  performed with a precision seldom attained. I have heard that Elkomoelhago's
  troops are famous for the perfection of their drill, and as justly so as is
  Veltopismakus for the beauty of her walks and gardens; but, my friend, these
  very things constitute the weakness of the city. While Elkomoelhago's
  warriors are practicing to perfect their appearance upon parade, the warriors
  of my father, Adendrohahkis, are far afield, out of sight of admiring women
  and spying slaves, practicing the art of war under the rough conditions of
  the field and camp. The amaks of Elkomoelhago might easily defeat those of
  Adendrohahkis in a contest for the most beautiful; but it was not long since
  you saw less than fifteen thousand Trohanadalmakusians repulse fully thirty
  thousand warriors of Veltopismakus, for they never passed the infantry line
  that day. Yet, they can drill beautifully upon parade and they are
  courageous, all Minunians are that, but they have not been trained in the
  sterner arts of war&mdash;it is not the way of Elkomoelhago. He is soft and
  effeminate. He cares not for war. He listens to the advice he likes
  best&mdash;the advice of the weaklings and the women who urge him to refrain
  from war entirely, which would be not altogether bad if he could persuade the
  other fellow to refrain, also.</p>

  <p>"The beautiful trees and shrubs that almost make a forest of
  Veltopismakus, and which you so admire! I, too, admire them&mdash;especially
  do I admire them in the city of an enemy. How easy it would be for a
  Trohanadalmakusian army to creep through the night, hidden by the beautiful
  trees and shrubs, to the very gateways of the domes of Veltopismakus! Do you
  understand now, my friend, why you saw less perfect maneuvers upon the parade
  grounds of my city than you have seen here, and why, though we love trees and
  shrubbery, we have none planted within the city of Trohanadalmakus?"</p>

  <p>One of the guards who had approached him quickly from the rear touched
  Komodoflorensal upon the shoulder. "You said that Zuanthrol does not
  understand our language. Why then do you speak to him in this tongue which he
  cannot understand," the fellow demanded.</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal did not know how much the warrior had overheard. If he had
  heard Tarzan speak in Minuni it might be difficult to persuade the fellow
  that The Giant did not understand the language; but he must act on the
  assumption that he, alone, had been overheard.</p>

  <p>"He wishes to learn it and I am trying to teach him," replied
  Komodoflorensal quickly.</p>

  <p>"Has he learned anything of it?" asked the warrior.</p>

  <p>"No," said Komodoflorensal, "he is very stupid."</p>

  <p>And after this they went in silence, winding up long, gentle inclines, or
  again scaling the primitive ladders that the Minunians use to reach the upper
  levels of their dome-houses between the occasional levels that are not
  connected by the inclined runways, which are thus frequently broken for
  purposes of defense, the ladders being easily withdrawn upward behind
  hard-pressed defenders and the advance of the enemy thus more easily
  checked.</p>

  <p>The royal dome of Elkomoelhago was of vast proportions, its summit rising
  to an equivalent of over four hundred feet, had it been built upon a scale
  corresponding to the relatively larger size of ordinary mankind. Tarzan
  ascended until he was almost as far above ground as he had been below ground
  in the quarry. Where the corridors on lower levels had been crowded with
  humanity, those which they now traversed were almost devoid of life.
  Occasionally they passed a tenanted chamber, but far more generally the rooms
  were utilized for storage purposes, especially for food, great quantities of
  which, cured, dried neatly wrapped, was packed ceiling-high in many large
  chambers.</p>

  <p>The decorations of the walls were less ornate and the corridors narrower,
  on the whole, than those at lower levels. However, they passed through many
  large chambers, or halls, which were gorgeously decorated, and in several of
  which were many people of both sexes and all ages variously occupied, either
  with domestic activities or with the handiwork of one art or another.</p>

  <p>Here was a man working in silver, perhaps fashioning a bracelet of
  delicate filigree, or another carving beautiful arabesques upon leather.
  There were makers of pottery, weavers of cloth, metal-stampers, painters,
  makers of candles, and these appeared to predominate, for the candle was in
  truth life to these people.</p>

  <p>And then, at last, they reached the highest level, far above the ground,
  where the rooms were much closer to daylight because of the diminished
  thickness of the walls near the summit of the dome, but even here were the
  ever-present candles. Suddenly the walls of the corridor became gorgeously
  decorated, the number of candles increased, and Tarzan sensed that they were
  approaching the quarters of a rich or powerful noble. They halted, now,
  before a doorway where stood a sentinel, with whom one of the warriors
  conducting them communicated.</p>

  <p>"Tell Zoanthrohago Zertol that we have brought Zuanthrol and another slave
  who can communicate with him in a strange tongue."</p>

  <p>The sentinel struck a heavy gong with his lance and presently, from the
  interior of the chamber, a man appeared to whom the sentinel repeated the
  warrior's message.</p>

  <p>"Let them enter," said the newcomer, who was a white-tunicked slave; "my
  glorious master, Zoanthrohago Zertol, expects his slave Zuanthrol! Follow
  me!"</p>

  <p>They followed him through several chambers until at last he led them into
  the presence of a gorgeously garbed warrior who was seated behind a large
  table, or desk, upon which were numerous strange instruments, large,
  cumbersome looking volumes, pads of heavy Minunian writing paper and the
  necessary implements for writing. The man looked up as they entered the
  room.</p><a id="pic23"

    <p class="caption">He led them into the presence of a gorgeously garbed
    warrior.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"It is your slave, Zuanthrol, Zertol," announced the fellow who had led
  them hither.</p>

  <p>"But the other?" Prince Zoanthrohago pointed at Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"He speaks the strange language that Zuanthrol speaks, and he was brought
  along that you might communicate with Zuanthrol if you so wished."
  Zoanthrohago nodded.</p>

  <p>He turned to Komodoflorensal. "Ask him," he ordered, "if he feels any
  differently since I reduced his size."</p>

  <p>When the question was put to Tarzan by Komodoflorensal in the imaginary
  language with which they were supposed to communicate the ape-man shook his
  head, at the same time speaking a few words in English.</p>

  <p>"He says no, illustrious prince," translated Komodoflorensal out of his
  imagination, "and he asks when you will restore him to his normal size and
  permit him to return to his own country, which is far from Minuni."</p>

  <p>"As a Minunian he should know," replied the Zertol, "that he never will be
  permitted to return to his own country&mdash;Trohanadalmakus never will see
  him again."</p>

  <p>"But he is not of Trohanadalmakus, nor is he a Minunian," explained
  Komodoflorensal. "He came to us and we did not make a slave of him, but
  treated him as a friend, because he is from a far country with which we have
  never made war."</p>

  <p>"What country is that?" demanded Zoanthrohago.</p>

  <p>"That we do not know, but he says that there is a great country beyond the
  thorns where dwell many millions as large as was he. He says that his people
  would not be unfriendly to ours and for this reason we should not enslave
  him, but treat him as a guest."</p>

  <p>Zoanthrohago smiled. "If you believe this you must be a simple fellow,
  Trohanadalmakusian," he said. "We all know that there is naught beyond Minuni
  but impenetrable forests of thorn to the very uttermost wall of the blue dome
  within which we all dwell. I can well believe that the fellow is no
  Trohanadalmakusian, but he most certainly is a Minunian, since all creatures
  of whatever kind dwell in Minuni. Doubtless he is a strange form of
  Zertalacolol, a member of a tribe inhabiting some remote mountain fastness,
  which we have never previously discovered; but be that as it may, he will
  never&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At this juncture the prince was interrupted by the clanging of the great
  gong at the outer entrance to his apartments. He paused to count the strokes
  and when they reached five and ceased he turned to the warriors who had
  conducted Tarzan and Komodoflorensal to his presence.</p>

  <p>"Take the slaves into that chamber," he instructed, pointing to a doorway
  in the rear of the apartment in which he had received them. "When the king
  has gone I will send for them."</p>

  <p>As they were crossing toward the doorway Zoanthrohago had indicated a
  warrior halted in the main entrance to the chamber. "Elkomoelhago," he
  announced, "Thagosto of Veltopismakus, Ruler of All Men, Master of Created
  Things, All-Wise, All-Courageous, All-Glorious! Down before the
  thagosto!"</p>

  <p>Tarzan glanced back as he was quitting the chamber to see Zoanthrohago and
  the others in the room kneel and lean far back with arms raised high above
  their heads as Elkomoelhago entered with a guard of a dozen gorgeous
  warriors, and he could not but compare this ruler with the simple and
  dignified soldier who ruled Trohanadalmakus and who went about his city
  without show or pomp, and oftentimes with no other escort than a single
  slave; a ruler to whom no man bent his knee, yet to whom was accorded the
  maximum of veneration and respect.</p>

  <p>And Elkomoelhago had seen the slaves and the warriors leave the chamber as
  he had entered it. He acknowledged the salutes of Zoanthrohago and his people
  with a curt wave of the hand and commanded them to arise.</p>

  <p>"Who quitted the apartment as I entered?" he demanded, looking
  suspiciously at Zoanthrohago.</p>

  <p>"The slave Zuanthrol and another who interprets his strange language for
  me," explained the Zertol.</p>

  <p>"Have them back," commanded the thagosto; "I would speak with you
  concerning Zuanthrol."</p>

  <p>Zoanthrohago instructed one of his slaves to fetch them and, in the few
  moments that it required, Elkomoelhago took a chair behind the desk at which
  his host had been sitting. When Tarzan and Komodoflorensal entered the
  chamber the guard who accompanied them brought them to within a few paces of
  the desk behind which the king sat, and here he bade them kneel and make
  their obeisance to the thagosto.</p>

  <p>Familiar since childhood, was every tradition of slavery to
  Komodoflorensal the Trohanadalmakusian. Almost in a spirit of fatalism had he
  accepted the conditions of this servitude that the fortunes of war had thrust
  him into and so it was that, without question or hesitation, he dropped to
  one knee in servile salute to this alien king; but not so Tarzan of the Apes.
  He was thinking of Adendrohahkis. He had bent no knee to him and he did not
  propose to do greater honor to Elkomoelhago, whose very courtiers and slaves
  despised him, than he had done to the really great king of Veltopismakus.</p>

  <p>Elkomoelhago glared at him. "The fellow is not kneeling," he whispered to
  Zoanthrohago, who had been leaning back so far that he had not noticed the
  new slave's act of disrespect.</p>

  <p>The Zertol glanced toward Tarzan. "Down, fellow!" he cried, and then
  recalling that he understood no Minunian, he commanded Komodoflorensal to
  order him to kneel, but when the Trohanadalmakusian Zertolosto pretended to
  do so Tarzan but shook his head.</p>

  <p>Elkomoelhago signaled the others to rise. "We will let it pass this time,"
  he said, for something in the attitude of the slave told him that Zuanthrol
  never would kneel to him and as he was valuable because of the experiment of
  which he was the subject, the king preferred to swallow his pride rather than
  risk having the slave killed in an effort to compel him to kneel. "He is but
  an ignorant Zertalacolol. See that he is properly instructed before we see
  him again."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE Alali women, fifty strong, sallied forth into the forest
  to chastise their recalcitrant males. They carried their heavy bludgeons and
  many-feathered pebbles, but most formidable of all was their terrific rage.
  Never in the memory of one of them had man dared question their authority,
  never had he presumed to show aught but fear of them; but now, instead of
  slinking away at their approach, he had dared defy them, to attack them, to
  slay them! But such a condition was too preposterous, too unnatural, to
  exist, nor would it exist much longer. Had they had speech they would have
  said that and a number of other things. It was looking black for the men; the
  women were in an ugly mood&mdash;but what else could be expected of women who
  were denied the power of speech?</p>

  <p>And in this temper they came upon the men in
  a large clearing where the renegades had built a fire and were cooking the
  flesh of a number of antelope. Never had the women seen their men so sleek
  and trim. Always before had they appeared skinny to the verge of
  cadaverousness, for in the past they had never fared so well as since the day
  that Tarzan of the Apes had given weapons to the son of The First Woman.
  Where before they had spent their lives fleeing in terror from their terrible
  women, with scarce time to hunt for decent food, now they had leisure and
  peace of mind and their weapons brought them flesh that otherwise they might
  not have tasted once in a year. From caterpillars and grubworms they had
  graduated to an almost steady diet of antelope meat.</p>

  <p>But the women gave very little heed at the moment to the physical
  appearance of the men. They had found them. That was enough. They were
  creeping nearer when one of the men looked up and discovered them, and so
  insistent are the demands of habit that he forgot his new-found independence
  and leaping to his feet, bolted for the trees. The others, scarce waiting to
  know the cause of his precipitancy, followed close upon his heels. The women
  raced across the clearing as the men disappeared among the trees upon the
  opposite side. The former knew what the men would do. Once in the forest they
  would stop behind the nearest trees and look back to see if their pursuers
  were coming in their direction. It was this silly habit of the males that
  permitted their being easily caught by the less agile females.</p>

  <p>But all the men had not disappeared. One had taken a few steps in the mad
  race for safety and had then halted and wheeled about, facing the oncoming
  women. He was the son of The First Woman, and to him Tarzan had imparted
  something more than knowledge of new weapons, for from the Lord of the
  Jungle, whom he worshipped with doglike devotion, he had acquired the first
  rudiments of courage, and so it now happened that when his more timorous
  fellows paused behind the trees and looked back they saw this one standing
  alone facing the charge of fifty infuriated shes. They saw him fit arrow to
  bow, and the women saw, too, but they did not understand&mdash;not
  immediately&mdash;and then the bow string twanged and the foremost woman
  collapsed with an arrow in her heart; but the others did not pause, because
  the thing had been done so quickly that the full purport of it had not as yet
  penetrated their thick skulls. The son of The First Woman fitted a second
  arrow and sped it. Another woman fell, rolling over and over, and now the
  others hesitated&mdash;hesitated and were lost, for that momentary pause gave
  courage to the other men peering from behind the trees. If one of their
  number could face fifty women and bring them to halt what might not eleven
  men accomplish? They rushed forth then with spears and arrows just as the
  women renewed their assault. The feathered pebbles flew thick and fast, but
  faster and more accurately flew the feathered arrows of the men. The leading
  women rushed courageously forward to close quarters where they might use
  their bludgeons and lay hold of the men with their mighty hands, but they
  learned then that spears were more formidable weapons than bludgeons, with
  the result that those who did not fall wounded, turned and fled.</p>

  <p>It was then that the son of The First Woman revealed possession of a spark
  of generalship that decided the issue for that day, and, perhaps, for all
  time. His action was epochal in the existence of the Zertalacolols. Instead
  of being satisfied with repulsing the women, instead of resting upon laurels
  gloriously won, he turned the tables upon the hereditary foe and charged the
  women, signaling his fellows to accompany him, and when they saw the women
  running from them, so enthused were they by this reversal of a custom ages
  old, they leaped swiftly in pursuit.</p>

  <p>They thought that the son of The First Woman intended that they should
  slay all of the enemy and so they were surprised when they saw him overhaul a
  comely, young female and, seizing her by the hair, disarm her. So remarkable
  did it seem to them that one of their number, having a woman in his power,
  did not immediately slay her, they were constrained to pause and gather
  around him, asking questions in their strange sign language.</p>

  <p>"Why do you hold her?" "Why do you not kill her?" "Are you not afraid
  that she will kill you?" were some of the many that were launched at him.</p>

  <p>"I am going to keep her," replied the son of The First Woman. "I do not
  like to cook. She shall cook for me. If she refuses I shall stick her with
  this," and he made a jab toward the young woman's ribs with his spear, a
  gesture that caused her to cower and drop fearfully upon one knee.</p><a id=

    <p class="caption">"I am going to keep her," replied the son of The First
    Woman.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The men jumped up and down in excitement as the value of this plan and the
  evident terror of the woman for the man sank into their dull souls.</p>

  <p>"Where are the women?" they signed to one another; but the women had
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>One of the men started off in the direction they had gone. "I go!" he
  signaled. "I come back with a woman of my own, to cook for me!" In a mad rush
  the others followed him, leaving the son of The First Woman alone with his
  she. He turned upon her.</p>

  <p>"You will cook for me?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>To his signs she but returned a sullen, snarling visage. The son of The
  First Woman raised his spear and with the heavy shaft struck the girl upon
  the head, knocking her down, and he stood over her, himself snarling and
  scowling, menacing her with further punishment, while she cowered where she
  had fallen. He kicked her in the side.</p>

  <p>"Get up!" he commanded.</p>

  <p>Slowly she crawled to her knees and embracing his legs gazed up into his
  face with an expression of doglike adulation and devotion.</p>

  <p>"You will cook for me!" he demanded again.</p>

  <p>"Forever!" she replied in the sign language of their people.</p>

  <p><br>
  TARZAN had remained but a short time in the little room adjoining that in
  which Zoanthrohago had received Elkomoelhago, when he was summoned to appear
  before them alone, and as he entered the room his master motioned him to
  approach the desk behind which the two men sat. There was no other person in
  the room, even the warriors having been dismissed.</p>

  <p>"You are quite positive that he understands nothing of our language?"
  demanded the king.</p>

  <p>"He has not spoken a word since he was captured," replied Zoanthrohago.
  "We had supposed him some new form of Zertalacolol until it was discovered
  that he possessed a language through which he was able to communicate with
  the other Trohanadalmakusian slave. It is perfectly safe to speak freely
  before him, All-Wise."</p>

  <p>Elkomoelhago cast a quick, suspicious glance at his companion. He would
  have preferred that Zoanthrohago of all men address him as
  All-Glorious&mdash;it was less definite in its implication. He might deceive
  others, even himself, as to his wisdom, but he was perfectly aware that he
  could not fool Zoanthrohago.</p>

  <p>"We have never discussed fully," said the king, "the details of this
  experiment. It was for this purpose that I came to the laboratory today. Now
  that we have the subject here let us go into the matter fully and determine
  what next step we should take."</p>

  <p>"Yes, All-Wise," replied Zoanthrohago.</p>

  <p>"Call me Thagosto," snapped Elkomoelhago.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Thagosto," said the prince, using the Minunian word for Chief-Royal,
  or King, as Elkomoelhago had commanded. "Let us discuss the matter, by all
  means. It presents possibilities of great importance to your throne." He knew
  that what Elkomoelhago meant by discussing the matter consisted only in
  receiving from Zoanthrohago a detailed explanation of how he had reduced the
  stature of the slave Zuanthrol to one quarter its original proportions; but
  he proposed, if possible, to obtain value received for the information, which
  he knew the king would use for his own aggrandizement, giving Zoanthrohago no
  credit whatever for his discoveries or all the long moons he had devoted to
  accomplishing this marvelous, scientific miracle.</p>

  <p>"Before we enter into this discussion, O, Thagosto," he said, "I beg that
  you will grant me one boon, which I have long desired and have hitherto
  hesitated to request, knowing that I did not deserve the recognition I crave
  for my poor talents and my mean service to thy illustrious and justly
  renowned rule."</p>

  <p>"What boon do you wish?" demanded Elkomoelhago, crustily. At heart he
  feared this wisest of men, and, like the coward that he was, with him to fear
  was to hate. If he could have destroyed Zoanthrohago he would gladly have
  done so; but he could not afford to do this, since from this greatest of
  walmaks came whatever show of scientific ability the king could make, as well
  as all the many notable inventions for the safeguarding of the royal
  person.</p>

  <p>"I would sit at the royal council," said Zoanthrohago, simply.</p>

  <p>The king fidgeted. Of all the nobles of Veltopismakus here was the very
  last he would wish to see numbered among the royal councilors, whom he had
  chosen with especial reference to the obtuseness of their minds.</p>

  <p>"There are no vacancies," he said, at last.</p>

  <p>"The ruler of all men might easily make a vacancy," suggested
  Zoanthrohago, "or create a new post&mdash;Assistant Chief of Chiefs, for
  example, so that when Gofoloso was absent there would be one to take his
  place. Otherwise I should not have to attend upon your council meetings, but
  devote my time to the perfection of our discoveries and inventions."</p>

  <p>Here was a way out and Elkomoelhago seized it. He had no objection to
  Zoanthrohago being a royal councilor and thus escaping the burdensome income
  tax, which the makers of the tax had been careful to see proved no burden to
  themselves, and he knew that probably that was the only reason that
  Zoanthrohago wished to be a councilor. No, the king had no objection to the
  appointment provided it could be arranged that the new minister was present
  at no council meetings, for even Elkomoelhago would have shrunk a bit from
  claiming as his own all the great discoveries of Zoanthrohago had
  Zoanthrohago been present.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said the king, "you shall be appointed this very
  day&mdash;and when I want you at the council meetings I will send for
  you."</p>

  <p>Zoanthrohago bowed. "And now," he said, "to the discussion of our
  experiments, which we hope will reveal a method for increasing the stature of
  our warriors when they go forth to battle with our enemies, and of reducing
  them to normal size once more when they return."</p>

  <p>"I hate the mention of battles," cried the king, with a shudder.</p>

  <p>"But we must be prepared to win them when they are forced upon us,"
  suggested Zoanthrohago.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," assented the king; "but once we perfect this method of
  ours we shall need but a few warriors and the rest may be turned to peaceful
  and useful occupations. However, go on with the discussion."</p>

  <p>Zoanthrohago concealed a smile, and rising, walked around the end of the
  table and stopped beside the ape-man. "Here," he said, placing a finger at
  the base of Tarzan's skull, "there lies, as you know, a small, oval, reddish
  gray body containing a liquid which influences the growth of tissues and
  organs. It long ago occurred to me that interference with the normal
  functioning of this gland would alter the growth of the subject to which it
  belonged. I experimented with small rodents and achieved remarkable results;
  but the thing I wished to accomplish, the increase of man's stature I have
  been unable to achieve. I have tried many methods and some day I shall
  discover the right one. I think I am on the right track, and that it is
  merely now a matter of experimentation. You know that stroking your face
  lightly with a smooth bit of stone produces a pleasurable sensation. Apply
  the same stone to the same face in the same manner, but with greatly
  increased force and you produce a diametrically opposite sensation. Rub the
  stone slowly across the face and back again many times, and then repeat the
  same motion rapidly for the same number of times and you will discover that
  the results are quite different. I am that close to a solution; I have the
  correct method but not quite, as yet, the correct application. I can reduce
  creatures in size, but I cannot enlarge them; and although I can reduce them
  with great ease, I cannot determine the period or endurance of their
  reduction. In some cases, subjects have not regained their normal size under
  thirty-nine moons, and in others, they have done so in as short a period as
  three moons. There have been cases where normal stature was regained
  gradually during a period of seven suns, and others where the subject passed
  suddenly from a reduced size to normal size in less than a hundred
  heartbeats; this latter phenomenon being always accompanied by fainting and
  unconsciousness when it occurred during waking hours."</p>

  <p>"Of course," commented Elkomoelhago. "Now, let us see. I believe the thing
  is simpler than you imagine. You say that to reduce the size of this subject
  you struck him with a rock upon the base of the skull. Therefore, to enlarge
  his size, the most natural and scientific thing to do would be to strike him
  a similar blow upon the forehead. Fetch the rock and we will prove the
  correctness of my theory."</p>

  <p>For a moment Zoanthrohago was at a loss as to how best to circumvent the
  stupid intention of the king without humiliating his pride and arousing his
  resentment; but the courtiers of Elkomoelhago were accustomed to think
  quickly in similar emergencies and Zoanthrohago speedily found an avenue of
  escape from his dilemma.</p>

  <p>"You sagacity is the pride of your people, Thagosto," he said, "and your
  brilliant hyperbole the despair of your courtiers. In a clever figure of
  speech you suggest the way to achievement. By reversing the manner in which
  we reduced the stature of Zuanthrol we should be able to increase it; but,
  alas, I have tried this and failed. But wait, let us repeat the experiment
  precisely as it was originally carried out and then, by reversing it, we
  shall, perhaps, be enabled to determine why I have failed in the past."</p>

  <p>He stepped quickly across the room to one of a series of large cupboards
  that lined the wall and opening the door of it revealed a cage in which were
  a number of rodents. Selecting one of these he returned to the table, where,
  with wooden pegs and bits of cord he fastened the rodent securely to a smooth
  board, its legs spread out and its body flattened, the under side of the
  lower jaw resting firmly upon a small metal plate set flush with the surface
  of the board. He then brought forth a small wooden box and a large metal
  disc, the latter mounted vertically between supports that permitted it to be
  revolved rapidly by means of a hand crank. Mounted rigidly upon the same axis
  as the revolving disc was another which remained stationary. The latter disc
  appeared to have been constructed of seven segments, each of a different
  material from all the others, and from each of these segments a pad, or
  brush, protruded sufficiently to press lightly against the revolving
  disc.</p>

  <p>To the reverse side of each of the seven segments of the stationary disc a
  wire was attached, and these wires Zoanthrohago now connected to seven posts
  projecting from the upper surface of the wooden box. A single wire attached
  to a post upon the side of the box had at its other extremity a small, curved
  metal plate attached to the inside of a leather collar. This collar
  Zoanthrohago adjusted about the neck of the rodent so that the metal plate
  came in contact with its skin at the base of the skull and as close to the
  hypophysis gland as possible.</p>

  <p>He then turned his attention once more to the wooden box, upon the top of
  which, in addition to the seven binding posts, was a circular instrument
  consisting of a dial about the periphery of which were a series of
  hieroglyphics. From the center of this dial projected seven tubular,
  concentric shafts, each of which supported a needle, which was shaped or
  painted in some distinguishing manner, while beneath the dial seven small
  metal discs were set in the cover of the box so that they lay in the arc of a
  circle from the center of which a revolving metal shaft was so arranged that
  its free end might be moved to any of the seven metal discs at the will of
  the operator.</p>

  <p>The connections having all been made, Zoanthrohago moved the free end of
  the shaft from one of the metal discs to another, keeping his eyes at all
  times intently upon the dial, the seven needles of which moved variously as
  he shifted the shaft from point to point.</p>

  <p>Elkomoelhago was an intent, if somewhat bewildered, observer, and the
  slave, Zuanthrol, unobserved, had moved nearer the table that he might better
  watch this experiment which might mean so much to him.</p>

  <p>Zoanthrohago continued to manipulate the revolving shaft and the needles
  moved hither and thither from one series of hieroglyphics to another, until
  at last the walmak appeared satisfied.</p>

  <p>"It is not always easy," he said, "to attune the instrument to the
  frequency of the organ upon which we are working. From all matter and even
  from such incorporeal a thing as thought there emanate identical particles,
  so infinitesimal as to be scarce noted by the most delicate of my
  instruments. These particles constitute the basic structure of all things
  whether animate or inanimate, corporeal or incorporeal. The frequency,
  quantity and rhythm of the emanations determine the nature of the substance.
  Having located upon this dial the coefficient of the gland under discussion
  it now becomes necessary, in order to so interfere with its proper
  functioning that the growth of the creature involved will be not only stopped
  but actually reversed, that we decrease the frequency, increase the quantity
  and compound the rhythm of these emanations. This I shall now proceed to do,"
  and he forthwith manipulated several small buttons upon one side of the box,
  and grasping the crank handle of the free disc revolved it rapidly.</p>

  <p>The result was instantaneous and startling. Before their eyes
  Elkomoelhago, the king, and Zuanthrol, the slave, saw the rodent shrink
  rapidly in size, while retaining its proportions unchanged. Tarzan, who had
  followed every move and every word of the walmak, leaned far over that he
  might impress indelibly upon his memory the position of the seven needles.
  Elkomoelhago glanced up and discovered his interest.</p>

  <p>"We do not need this fellow now," he said, addressing Zoanthrohago. "Have
  him sent away."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Thagosto," replied Zoanthrohago, summoning a warrior whom he
  directed to remove Tarzan and Komodoflorensal to a chamber where they could
  be secured until their presence was again required.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THROUGH several chambers and corridors they were conducted
  toward the center of the dome on the same level as the chamber in which they
  had left the king and the walmak until finally they were thrust into a small
  chamber and a heavy door was slammed and barred behind them.</p>

  <p>There was no candle in the chamber. A faint light, however, relieved the
  darkness so that the interior of the room was discernible. The chamber
  contained two benches and a table&mdash;that was all. The light which faintly
  illuminated it entered through a narrow embrasure which was heavily barred,
  but it was evidently daylight.</p>

  <p>"We are alone," whispered Komodoflorensal, "and at last we can converse;
  but we must be cautious," he added. "'Trust not too far the loyalty of even
  the stones of your chamber!'" he quoted.</p>

  <p>"Where are we?" asked Tarzan. "You are more familiar with Minunian
  dwellings than I."</p>

  <p>"We are upon the highest level of the Royal Dome of Elkomoelhago," replied
  the prince. "With no such informality does a king visit the other domes of
  his city. You may rest assured that this is Elkomoelhago's. We are in one of
  the innermost chambers, next the central shaft that pierces the dome from its
  lowest level to its roof. For this reason we do not need a candle to support
  life&mdash;we will obtain sufficient air through this embrasure. And now,
  tell me what happened within the room with Elkomoelhago and
  Zoanthrohago."</p>

  <p>"I discovered how they reduced my stature," replied Tarzan, "and,
  furthermore, that at almost any time I may regain my full size&mdash;an
  occurrence that may eventuate from three to thirty-nine moons after the date
  of my reduction. Even Zoanthrohago cannot determine when this thing will
  happen."</p>

  <p>"Let us hope that it does not occur while you are in this small chamber,"
  exclaimed Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"I would have a devil of a time getting out," agreed Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"You would never get out," his friend assured him. "While you might,
  before your reduction, have crawled through some of the larger corridors upon
  the first level, or even upon many of the lower levels, you could not squeeze
  into the smaller corridors of the upper levels, which are reduced in size as
  the necessity for direct supports for the roof increase as we approach the
  apex of the dome."</p>

  <p>"Then it behooves me to get out of here as quickly as possible," said
  Tarzan.</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal shook his head. "Hope is a beautiful thing, my friend," he
  said, "but if you were a Minunian you would know that under such
  circumstances as we find ourselves it is a waste of mental energy. Look at
  these bars," and he walked to the window and shook the heavy irons that
  spanned the embrasure. "Think you that you could negotiate these?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't examined them," replied the ape-man, "but I shall never give up
  hope of escaping; that your people do is doubtless the principal reason that
  they remain forever in bondage. You are too much a fatalist,
  Komodoflorensal."</p>

  <p>As he spoke Tarzan crossed the room and standing at the prince's side took
  hold of the bars at the window. "They do not seem overheavy," he remarked,
  and at the same time exerted pressure upon them. They bent! Tarzan was
  interested now and Komodoflorensal, as well. The ape-man threw all his
  strength and weight into the succeeding effort with the result that two bars,
  bent almost double, were torn from their setting.</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal gazed at him in astonishment. "Zoanthrohago reduced your
  size, but left you with your former physical prowess," he cried.</p>

  <p>"In no other way can it be accounted for," replied Tarzan, who now, one by
  one, was removing the remaining bars from the window embrasure. He
  straightened one of the shorter ones and handed it to Komodoflorensal. "This
  will make a good weapon," he said, "if we are forced to fight for our
  liberty," and then he straightened another for himself.</p>

  <p>The Trohanadalmakusian gazed at him in wonder. "And you intend," he
  demanded, "to defy a city of four hundred and eighty thousand people, armed
  only with a bit of iron rod?"</p>

  <p>"And my wits," added Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"You will need them," said the prince.</p>

  <p>"And I shall use them," Tarzan assured him.</p>

  <p>"When shall you start?" asked Komodoflorensal, chaffingly.</p>

  <p>"Tonight, tomorrow, next moon&mdash;who knows?" replied the ape-man.
  "Conditions must be ripe. All the time I shall be watching and planning. In
  that sense I started to escape the instant I regained consciousness and knew
  that I was a prisoner."</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You have no faith in me?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"That is precisely what I have&mdash;faith," replied Komodoflorensal. "My
  judgment tells me that you cannot succeed and yet I shall cast my lot with
  you, hoping for success, yes, believing in success. If that is not faith I do
  not know what it might be called."</p>

  <p>The ape-man smiled. He seldom, if ever, laughed aloud. "Let us commence,"
  he said. "First we will arrange these rods so that they will have the
  appearance, from the doorway, of not having been disturbed, for I take it we
  shall have an occasional visitor. Some one will bring us food, at least, and
  whoever comes must suspect nothing."</p>

  <p>Together they arranged the rods so that they might be quickly removed and
  as quickly replaced. By that time it was getting quite dark within the
  chamber. Shortly after they had finished with the rods their door opened and
  two warriors, lighting their way with candles, appeared escorting a slave who
  bore food in bucket-like receptacles and water in bottles made of glazed
  pottery.</p>

  <p>As they were going away again, after depositing the food and drink just
  inside the doorway, taking their candles with them, Komodoflorensal addressed
  them.</p>

  <p>"We are without candles, warrior," he said to the nearer. "Will you not
  leave us one of yours?"</p>

  <p>"You need no candle in this chamber," replied the man. "One night in
  darkness will do you good, and tomorrow you return to the quarry.
  Zoanthrohago is done with you. In the quarry you will have plenty of
  candles," and he passed out of the chamber, closing the door behind him.</p>

  <p>The two slaves heard the heavy bolt shot into place upon the opposite side
  of the door. It was very dark now. With difficulty they found the receptacles
  containing the food and water.</p>

  <p>"Well?" inquired Komodoflorensal, dipping into one of the food jars. "Do
  you think it is going to be so easy now, when tomorrow you will be back in
  the quarry, perhaps five hundred huals below ground?"</p>

  <p>"But I shall not be," replied Tarzan, "and neither shall you."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked the prince.</p>

  <p>"Because, since they expect to remove us to the quarries tomorrow, it
  follows that we must escape tonight," explained Tarzan.</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal only laughed.</p>

  <p>When Tarzan had eaten his fill he arose and walked to the window, where he
  removed the bars and, taking the one that he had selected for himself,
  crawled through the passage that led to the opposite end of the embrasure,
  for even so close to the apex of the dome the wall was quite thick, perhaps
  ten huals. The hual, which is about three inches in length by our standards,
  constitutes the Minunian basic unit of measure, corresponding most closely to
  our foot. At this high level the embrasure was much smaller than those
  opening at lower levels, practically all of which were of sufficient size to
  permit a warrior to walk erect within them; but here Tarzan was forced to
  crawl upon all fours.</p>

  <p>At the far end he found himself looking out into a black void above which
  the stars were shining and about the sides of which were dotted vague
  reflections of inner lights, marking the lighted chambers within the dome.
  Above him it was but a short distance to the apex of the dome, below was a
  sheer drop of four hundred huals.</p>

  <p>Tarzan, having seen all that could be seen from the mouth of the
  embrasure, returned to the chamber. "How far is it, Komodoflorensal," he
  asked, "from the floor of this embrasure to the roof of the dome?"</p>

  <p>"Twelve huals, perhaps," replied the Trohanadalmakusian.</p>

  <p>Tarzan took the longest of the bars from the embrasure and measured it as
  best he could. "Too far," he said.</p>

  <p>"What is too far?" demanded Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"The roof," explained Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"What difference does it make where the roof is&mdash;you did not expect
  to escape by way of the roof of the dome, did you?"</p>

  <p>"Most certainly&mdash;had it been accessible," replied the ape-man; "but
  now we shall have to go by way of the shaft, which will mean crossing
  entirely through the dome from the interior shaft to the outer periphery. The
  other route would have entailed less danger of detection."</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal laughed aloud. "You seem to think that to escape a
  Minunian city it is only necessary to walk out and away. It cannot be done.
  What of the sentries? What of the outer patrols? You would be discovered
  before you were halfway down the outside of the dome, provided that you could
  get that far without falling to your death."</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps the shaft would be safer," said Tarzan. "There would be less
  likelihood of discovery before we reached the bottom, for from what I could
  see it is as dark as pitch in the shaft."</p>

  <p>"Clamber down the inside of the shaft!" exclaimed Komodoflorensal. "You
  are mad! You could not clamber from this level to the next without falling,
  and it must be a full four hundred huals to the bottom."</p>

  <p>"Wait!" Tarzan admonished him.</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal could hear his companion moving around in the dark
  chamber. He heard the scraping of metal on stone and presently he heard a
  pounding, not loud, yet heavy.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" said Tarzan.</p>

  <p>And Komodoflorensal waited, wondering. It was Tarzan who spoke next.</p>

  <p>"Could you find the chamber in which Talaskar is confined in the quarry?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>"Why?" demanded the prince.</p>

  <p>"We are going after her," explained Tarzan. "We promised that we would not
  leave without her."</p>

  <p>"I can find it," said Komodoflorensal, rather sullenly Tarzan thought.</p>

  <p>For some time the ape-man worked on in silence, except for the muffled
  pounding and the scraping of iron on stone, or of iron on iron.</p>

  <p>"Do you know every one in Trohanadalmakus?" Tarzan asked, suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Why, no," replied Komodoflorensal. "There are a million souls, including
  all the slaves. I could not know them all."</p>

  <p>"Did you know by sight all those that dwelt in the royal dome?" continued
  the ape-man.</p>

  <p>"No, not even those who lived in the royal dome," replied the
  Trohanadalmakusian; "though doubtless I knew practically all of the nobles,
  and the warrior class by sight if not by name."</p>

  <p>"Did any one?" asked Tarzan,</p>

  <p>"I doubt it," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Good!" exclaimed Tarzan.</p>

  <p>Again there was a silence, broken again by the Englishman.</p>

  <p>"Can a warrior go anywhere without question in any dome of his own city?"
  he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Anywhere, under ordinary circumstances, except into the king's dome, in
  daytime."</p>

  <p>"One could not go about at night, then?" asked Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"No," replied his companion.</p>

  <p>"By day, might a warrior go and come in the quarries as he pleased?"</p>

  <p>"If he appeared to be employed he would not be questioned,
  ordinarily."</p>

  <p>Tarzan worked a little longer in silence. "Come!" he said presently; "we
  are ready to go."</p>

  <p>"I shall go with you," said Komodoflorensal, "because I like you and
  because I think it would be better to be dead than a slave. At least we shall
  have some pleasure out of what remains to us of life, even though it be not a
  long life."</p>

  <p>"I think we shall have some pleasure, my friend," replied Zuanthrol. "We
  may not escape; but, like you, I should rather die now than remain a slave
  for life. I have chosen tonight for our first step toward freedom, because I
  realize that once returned to the quarry our chances for a successful break
  for liberty will be reduced to almost nothing, and tonight is our only night
  above ground."</p>

  <p>"How do you propose that we escape from this chamber?"</p>

  <p>"By way of the central shaft," replied Tarzan; "but first tell me, may a
  white-tunicked slave enter the quarries freely by day?"</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal wondered what bearing all these seemingly immaterial
  questions had upon the problem of their escape; but he answered
  patiently:</p>

  <p>"No, white tunics are never seen in the quarries."</p>

  <p>"Have you the iron bar I straightened for you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then follow me through the embrasure. Bring the other rods that I shall
  leave in the opening. I will carry the bulk of them. Come!"</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal heard Tarzan crawling into the embrasure, the iron rods
  that he carried breaking the silence of the little chamber. Then he followed.
  In the mouth of the embrasure he found the rods that Tarzan had left for him
  to carry. There were four rods, the ends of each bent into hooks. It had been
  upon this work that Tarzan had been engaged in the
  darkness&mdash;Komodoflorensal wondered to what purpose. Presently his
  further advance was halted by Tarzan's body.</p>

  <p>"Just a moment," said the ape-man. "I am making a hole in the window
  ledge. When that is done we shall be ready." A moment later he turned his
  head back toward his companion. "Pass along the rods," he said.</p><a id=

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">"Just a moment," said the ape-man. "I am making a hole
    in the window-ledge."</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>After Komodoflorensal had handed the hooked rods to Tarzan he heard the
  latter working with them, very quietly, for several minutes, and then he
  heard him moving his body about in the narrow confines of the embrasure and
  presently when the ape-man spoke again the Trohanadalmakusian realized that
  he had turned around and that his head was close to that of his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"I shall go first, Komodoflorensal," he said. "Come to the edge of the
  embrasure and when you hear me whistle once, follow me."</p>

  <p>"Where?" asked the prince.</p>

  <p>"Down the shaft to the first embrasure that will give us foot-hold, and
  let us pray that there is one directly below this within the next eighteen
  huals. I have hooked the rods together, the upper end hooked into the hole I
  made in the ledge, the lower end dangling down a distance of eighteen
  huals."</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, my friend," said Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>Tarzan smiled and slipped over the edge of the embrasure. In one hand he
  carried the rod that he had retained as a weapon, with the other he clung to
  the window ledge. Below him for eighteen huals dangled the slender ladder of
  iron hooks, and below this, four hundred huals of pitchy darkness hid the
  stone flagging of the inner courtyard. Perhaps it roofed the great central
  throne room of the king, as was true in the royal dome of Adendrohahkis;
  perhaps it was but an open court. The truth was immaterial if the frail
  support slipped from the shallow hole in the ledge above, or if one of the
  hooks straightened under the weight of the ape-man.</p>

  <p>Now he grasped the upper section of his ladder with the hand that held his
  improvised weapon, removed the hand from the ledge and grasped the rod again,
  still lower down. In this way he lowered his body a few inches at a time. He
  moved very slowly for two reasons, the more important of which was that he
  feared that any sudden strains upon his series of hooks might straighten one
  of them and precipitate him into the abyss below; the other was the necessity
  for silence. It was very dark even this close to the summit of the dome, but
  that was rather an advantage than otherwise, for it hid his presence from any
  chance observer who might glance through one of the embrasures in the
  opposite wall of the shaft. As he descended he felt in both directions for an
  embrasure, but he was almost at the end of his ladder before he felt himself
  swing slightly into one. When he had lowered himself still farther and could
  look into the opening he saw that it was dark, an indication that it did not
  lead into an inhabited chamber, a fact for which he was thankful. He hoped,
  too, that the inner end of the embrasure was not barred, nor the door beyond
  bolted upon the outside.</p>

  <p>He whistled once, very low, for Komodoflorensal, and an instant later he
  felt the movement of the iron ladder that told him his companion had
  commenced the descent. The embrasure in which he stood was higher than the
  one they had just quitted, permitting him to stand erect. There he waited for
  the Trohanadalmakusian who was soon standing upon the ledge beside him.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" exclaimed the prince, in a whisper. "I should hate to have had to
  do that in the daytime when I could have seen all the way to the bottom. What
  next? We have come farther already than ever I dreamed would be possible. Now
  I am commencing to believe that escape may lie within the realm of
  possibilities."</p>

  <p>"We haven't started yet," Tarzan assured him; "but we are going to now.
  Come!"</p>

  <p>Grasping their rude weapons the two walked stealthily the length of the
  embrasure. There were no bars to impede their progress and they stepped to
  the floor of the chamber beyond. Very carefully, feeling each step before he
  planted a foot and with his weapon extended before him, Tarzan groped his way
  about the chamber, which he found was fairly well filled with casks and
  bottles, the latter in wooden and wicker cases. Komodoflorensal was directly
  behind him.</p>

  <p>"We are in one of the rooms where the nobles charged with enforcing the
  laws against wine have hidden confiscated liquor," whispered the
  Trohanadalmakusian. "I have heard much talk concerning the matter since I was
  made prisoner&mdash;the warriors and the slaves, too, seem to talk of nothing
  else but this and the high taxes. The chances are that the door is heavily
  barred&mdash;they guard these forbidden beverages as never they guarded their
  gold or jewels."</p>

  <p>"I have found the passageway leading to the door," whispered Tarzan, "and
  I can see a light beneath it."</p>

  <p>They crept stealthily the length of the passage. Each grasped his weapon
  more firmly as Tarzan gently tried the latch. It gave! Slowly the ape-man
  pushed the door ajar. Through the tiny aperture thus opened he could see a
  portion of the room. Its floor was strewn with gorgeous carpets, thick and
  soft. That portion of the wall that was revealed to him was hung with heavy
  fabrics woven in many colors and strange patterns&mdash;splendid, barbaric.
  Directly in the line of his vision the body of a man lay sprawled, face down,
  upon the floor&mdash;a pool of red stained a white rug beneath his head.</p>

  <p>Tarzan opened the door a little farther, revealing the bodies of three
  other men. Two lay upon the floor, the third upon a low divan. The scene,
  gorgeous in its coloring, tragic in its suggestion of mystery and violent
  death, held the eyes of the ape-man yet a moment longer before he opened the
  door still wider and leaped quickly to the center of the room, his weapon
  raised and ready, giving no possible skulking foe behind the door the
  opportunity to fell him that would have offered had he edged into the room
  slowly.</p>

  <p>A quick glance about the apartment showed the bodies of six men that had
  not been visible from the partially opened door. These were lying in a pile
  in one corner of the room.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">KOMODOFLORENSAL stood at Tarzan's side, his weapon ready to
  take issue with any who might question their presence here; but presently the
  end of his iron rod dropped to the floor and a broad smile overspread his
  features.</p>

  <p>Tarzan looked at him. "Who are they?" he demanded, "and why have they been
  killed?"</p>

  <p>"They are not dead, my friend," replied Komodoflorensal. "They are the
  nobles whose duty it is to prevent the use of wine. They are not
  dead&mdash;they are drunk."</p>

  <p>"But the blood beneath the head of this one at my feet!" demanded the
  ape-man.</p>

  <p>"It is red wine, not blood," his companion assured him. Then Tarzan
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"They could not have chosen a better night for their orgy," he said. "Had
  they remained sober the door through which we entered from the storeroom
  would have been securely fastened, I imagine."</p>

  <p>"Assuredly, and we would have had a sober guard of warriors to deal with
  in this chamber, instead of ten drunken nobles. We are very fortunate,
  Zuanthrol."</p>

  <p>He had scarcely ceased speaking when a door in the opposite side of the
  room swung open, revealing two warriors, who stepped immediately into the
  chamber. They eyed the two who faced them and then glanced about the room at
  the inert forms of its other occupants.</p>

  <p>"What do you here, slaves?" demanded one of the newcomers.</p>

  <p>"Sh-sh-sh!" cautioned Tarzan, placing a finger to his lips. "Enter and
  close the door, lest others hear."</p>

  <p>"There is no one near to hear," snapped one of them, but they entered and
  he closed the door. "What is the meaning of this?"</p>

  <p>"That you are our prisoners," cried the ape-man, leaping past them and
  placing himself before the door, his iron rod in readiness.</p>

  <p>A sneer twisted the mouth of each of the two Veltopismakusians as they
  whipped out their rapiers and leaped toward the ape-man, ignoring for the
  moment the Trohanadalmakusian, who, seizing upon the opportunity thus
  afforded him, threw aside his iron rod and snatched a rapier from the side of
  one of the drunken nobles&mdash;a substitution of weapons that would render
  Komodoflorensal a dangerous opponent anywhere in Minuni, for there was no
  better swordsman among all the warlike clans of Trohanadalmakus, whose blades
  were famed throughout Minuni.</p>

  <p>Facing, with only an iron rod, two skilled swordsmen placed Tarzan of the
  Apes at a disadvantage that might have proved his undoing had it not been for
  the presence of Komodoflorensal, who, no sooner than he had appropriated a
  weapon, leaped forward and engaged one of the warriors. The other pressed
  Tarzan fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Your prisoner, eh, slave?" he sneered as he lunged for his opponent; but
  though less skilled, perhaps, in swordplay than his antagonist, the Lord of
  the Jungle had not faced Bolgani and Numa for nothing. His movements were as
  lightning, his strength as great as before Zoanthrohago had reduced his
  stature. At the first onslaught of the warriors he had leaped to one side to
  avoid the thrust of a blade, and as much to his own astonishment as to
  theirs, what he had intended for a nimble sidestep had carried him the length
  of the room, and then the man had been at him again, while the other was
  having his time well occupied with the Zertolosto of Trohanadalmakus.</p>

  <p>Twice Tarzan parried cuts with his cumbersome bar and then a thrust but
  missed him by a hairsbreadth, his sidestep coming but in the nick of time. It
  was a close call, for the man had lunged at his abdomen&mdash;a close call
  for Tarzan and death for his opponent, for as the point slipped harmlessly by
  him the ape-man swung his rod upon the unguarded head of the
  Veltopismakusian, and with a grunt the fellow slumped to the floor, his skull
  crushed to the bridge of his nose.</p>

  <p>Then Tarzan turned to aid Komodoflorensal, but the son of Adendrohahkis
  needed no aid. He had his man against the wall and was running him through
  the heart as Tarzan turned in their direction. As the man fell,
  Komodoflorensal swung toward the center of the room and as his eye fell upon
  the ape-man a smile crossed his face.</p>

  <p>"With an iron bar you bested a swordsman of Minuni!" he cried. "I would
  not have believed it possible and so I hastened to dispatch my man that I
  might come to your rescue before it was too late."</p>

  <p>Tarzan laughed. "I had the same thought in mind concerning you," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"And you could have well held it had I not been able to secure this
  rapier," Komodoflorensal assured him. "But what now? We have again come much
  farther than it seems possible we can have. Naught will surprise me
  hereafter."</p>

  <p>"We are going to trade apparel with these two unfortunate gentlemen," said
  Tarzan, divesting himself of the green tunic as he spoke.</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal chuckled as he followed the example of his companion.</p>

  <p>"There are other peoples as great as the Minunians," he declared, "though
  until I met you, my friend, I should never have believed it."</p>

  <p>A few moments later the two stood garbed in the habiliments of
  Veltopismakusian warriors and Tarzan was slipping his green tunic upon the
  corpse of him whom he had slain.</p>

  <p>"But why are you doing that?" asked the prince.</p>

  <p>"Do likewise with yours and you will see, presently," Tarzan replied.</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal did as the other bid him and when the change had been
  completed the ape-man threw one of the corpses across his shoulder and
  carried it into the storeroom, followed closely by Komodoflorensal with the
  other. Walking through the window embrasure to the edge of the shaft Tarzan
  hurled his burden out into space, and reaching back took Komodoflorensal's
  from him and pitched it after the first.</p>

  <p>"If they do not examine them too closely," he said, "the ruse may serve to
  convince them that we died attempting to escape." As he spoke he detached two
  of the hooks from the ladder down which they had clambered from the window of
  their dungeon and dropped them after the corpses. "These will lend color to
  the suggestion," he added, in explanation.</p>

  <p>Together they returned to the room where the drunken nobles lay, where
  Komodoflorensal began to rifle the fat money pouches of the unconscious
  men.</p>

  <p>"We shall need all of this that we can get if we are to pose as
  Veltopismakusian warriors for any length of time," he said. "I know these
  people by reputation and that gold will buy many of the things that we may
  require&mdash;the blindness of guards and the complaisance of officials, if
  they do not guess too close to the truth concerning us."</p>

  <p>"That part of it you must attend to, Komodoflorensal," said Tarzan, "for I
  am unfamiliar with the ways of your people; but we may not remain here. These
  gentlemen have served us well, and themselves, too, for their faithlessness
  and debauchery saved their lives, while the two who followed in sobriety the
  path of duty were destroyed."</p>

  <p>"Matters are strangely ordered," commented Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"In Minuni as elsewhere," agreed Tarzan, leading the way to the door of
  the chamber which they found opened into a corridor instead of into another
  chamber as they had rather expected would be the fact at a point thus close
  to the central shaft.</p>

  <p>In silence they proceeded along the passageway, which, at this hour of the
  morning, was deserted. They passed lighted chambers, where men and women were
  sleeping peacefully in the glare of many candles. They saw a sentry asleep
  before the door of a noble's quarters. No one discovered them and thus they
  passed down a series of inclined runways and along interminable corridors
  until they were far from that portion of the royal dome in which they had
  been incarcerated and where it would be most natural for the search for them
  to commence in the event that the bodies they had hurled into the shaft were
  not immediately discovered, or were identified for what they really were,
  rather than for what the two fugitives had tried to make them appear.</p>

  <p>And now a white-tunicked slave was approaching them along the corridor. He
  passed without paying them any heed, and presently another and another
  appeared until the two realized that morning was approaching and the
  corridors would soon be filled with the inhabitants of the dome.</p>

  <p>"It will be best," said Komodoflorensal, "to find a hiding place until
  there are more people abroad. We shall be safer in a crowd than among just a
  few where we shall be the more noticeable."</p>

  <p>Nearly all the chambers they passed now were occupied by families, while
  those that were untenanted were without candles and therefore unsafe as
  hiding places for any length of time; but presently Komodoflorensal touched
  Tarzan's arm and pointed to a hieroglyphic beside a door they were
  approaching.</p>

  <p>"Just the place," he said.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Tarzan, and as they came opposite the open door; "Why,
  it is filled with men! When they awake we shall be discovered."</p>

  <p>"But not recognized," returned the Trohanadalmakusian; "or at least the
  chances are slight that we shall be. This is a common chamber where any man
  may purchase lodgings over night. Doubtless there are visitors from other
  domes and strangers will not be particularly remarked on this
  account."</p><a id="pic26"
        name="pic26"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">"This is a common chamber where any man may purchase
    lodgings over night."</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>He entered the room, followed by Tarzan. A white-tunicked slave approached
  them. "Candles for two," demanded Komodoflorensal, handing the slave one of
  the smaller golden coins he had filched from the sleeping nobles.</p>

  <p>The fellow led them to a far corner of the room where there was plenty of
  space upon the floor, lit two candles and left them. A moment later they were
  stretched at full length, their faces toward the wall as a further protection
  against recognition, and were soon asleep.</p>

  <p>When Tarzan awoke he saw that he and Komodoflorensal were the only
  remaining occupants of the chamber, other than the slave who had admitted
  them, and he awoke his companion, believing that they should do nothing that
  might even in a slight degree call more than ordinary attention to them. A
  bucket of water was brought them and they performed their ablutions at a
  gutter which encircled the chamber, passing along the foot of each wall, as
  was the custom throughout Minuni, the waste water being carried away in pipes
  to the fields beyond the cities, where it was used for irrigating the crops.
  As all the water had to be carried into the domes and to the different levels
  in buckets, the amount used for ablutions was reduced to the minimum, the
  warrior and noble class getting the bulk of it, while the white-tunicked
  slaves depended principally upon the rivers, near which domes are always
  erected, for their baths. The green slaves fare the worst, and suffer a real
  hardship through lack of bathing facilities, for the Minunians are a cleanly
  people; but they manage to alleviate their plight to some extent, where the
  quarry masters are more kindly disposed, by the use of stagnant seepage water
  that accumulates in every quarry at the lower levels and which, not being fit
  for drinking purposes, may be used by the slaves for bathing when they are
  permitted the time to obtain it.</p>

  <p>Having washed, Tarzan and Komodoflorensal passed out into the corridor, a
  broad thoroughfare of the dome city, where there were now passing two solid
  lines of humanity moving in opposite directions, the very numbers of the
  people proving their greatest safeguard against detection. Candles at
  frequent intervals diffused a brilliant light and purified the air. Open
  doorways revealed shops of various descriptions within which men and women
  were bartering for goods, and now Tarzan had his first real glimpse of
  Veltopismakusian life. The shops were all conducted by white-tunicked slaves,
  but slaves and warriors intermingled as customers, both sexes of each class
  being represented. It was Tarzan's first opportunity, also, to see the women
  of the warrior class outside their own homes. He had seen the Princess
  Janzara in the palace quarters and, through the doorways in various portions
  of the dome, he had seen other women of varying stations in life; but these
  were the first that he had seen abroad at close hand. Their faces were
  painted deep vermilion, their ears blue, and their apparel so arranged that
  the left leg and left arm were bare, though if even so much as the right
  ankle or wrist became uncovered they hastily readjusted their garments to
  hide them, giving every evidence of confusion and embarrassment. As the
  ape-man watched them he was reminded of fat dowagers he had seen at home
  whose evening gowns left them naked to their kidneys, yet who would rather
  have died than to have exposed a knee.</p>

  <p>The front of the shops were covered with brilliant paintings, usually
  depicting the goods that were on sale, together with hieroglyphics describing
  the wares and advertising the name of the proprietor. One of these finally
  held the attention of the Trohanadalmakusian, and he touched Tarzan's arm and
  pointed toward it.</p>

  <p>"A place where food is served," he said. "Let us eat."</p>

  <p>"Nothing would suit me better. I am famished," Tarzan assured him, and so
  the two entered the little shop where several customers were already sitting
  upon the floor with small benches pulled close to them, upon which food was
  being served in wooden dishes. Komodoflorensal found a space near the rear of
  the shop, not far from a doorway leading into another chamber, which was also
  a shop of a different character, not all the places of business being
  fortunately located upon a corridor, but having their entrances, like this
  one, through another place of business.</p>

  <p>Having seated themselves and dragged a bench before them they looked about
  while waiting to be served. It was evidently a poor shop, Komodoflorensal
  told Tarzan, catering to the slave caste and the poorer warriors, of which
  there were several sitting at benches in different parts of the room. By
  their harness and apparel, which was worn and shabby, one might easily guess
  at their poverty. In the adjoining shop were several more of the same class
  of unfortunate warriors mending their own clothes with materials purchased
  from the poor shopkeeper.</p>

  <p>The meal was served by a slave in a white tunic of very cheap material,
  who was much surprised when payment for the meal and the service was offered
  in gold.</p>

  <p>"It is seldom," he said, "that warriors rich enough to possess gold come
  to our poor shop. Pieces of iron and bits of lead, with much wooden money,
  pass into my coffers; but rarely do I see gold. Once I did, and many of my
  customers were formerly of the richest of the city. Yonder see that tall man
  with the heavily wrinkled face. Once he was rich&mdash;the richest warrior in
  his dome. Look at him now! And see them in the next room performing menial
  services, men who once owned slaves so prosperous that they, in turn, hired
  other slaves to do the meaner duties for them. Victims, all of them, of the
  tax that Elkomoelhago has placed upon industry.</p>

  <p>"To be poor," he continued, "assures one an easier life than being rich,
  for the poor have no tax to pay, while those who work hard and accumulate
  property have only their labor for their effort, since the government takes
  all from them in taxes.</p>

  <p>"Over there is a man who was very rich. He worked hard all his life and
  accumulated a vast fortune. For several years after Elkomoelhago's new tax
  law was enforced, he struggled to earn enough to insure that his income would
  be at least equal to his taxes and the cost of his living; but he found that
  it was impossible. He had one enemy, a man who had wronged him grievously.
  This man was very poor, and to him he gave all of what remained of his great
  fortune and his property. It was a terrible revenge. From being a contented
  man, this victim of another's spleen is now a haggard wreck, laboring
  unceasingly eighteen hours each day in a futile attempt to insure himself an
  income that will defray his taxes."</p>

  <p>Having finished their meal the two fugitives returned to the corridor and
  continued their way downward through the dome toward the first level, keeping
  always to the more crowded corridors, where detection seemed least likely.
  Now, mounted men were more frequently encountered and so rapidly and
  recklessly did the warriors ride along the narrow corridors that it was with
  difficulty that the pedestrians avoided being ridden down and trampled, and
  it seemed to Tarzan but little less than a miracle that any of them arrived
  at their destinations uninjured. Having at last come to the lowest level,
  they were engaged in searching for one of the four corridors that would lead
  them from the dome, when their way was completely blocked by a great throng
  that had congregated at the intersection of two corridors. Those in the rear
  were stretching their necks to observe what was going on in the center of the
  gathering. Everyone was asking questions of his neighbor, but as yet no one
  upon the outskirts of the mob appeared to know what had occurred, until at
  last fragments of rumors filtered back to the farthermost. Tarzan and
  Komodoflorensal dared ask no questions, but they kept their ears open and
  presently they were rewarded by overhearing repeated what seemed to be an
  authoritative account of what had transpired to cause this congestion. In
  answer to a question put by one of the throng a fellow who was elbowing his
  way out from the center of the jam explained that those in front had halted
  to view the remains of two slaves who had been killed while trying to
  escape.</p>

  <p>"They were locked in one of Zoanthrohago's slave cells at the very highest
  level," he told his questioner, "and they tried to escape by climbing down an
  improvised ladder into the central shaft. Their ladder broke and they were
  precipitated to the roof of the throne room, where their bodies, terribly
  mangled, were but just found. They are being carried out to the beasts, now.
  One of them was a great loss to Zoanthrohago as it was the slave Zuanthrol,
  upon whom he was experimenting."</p>

  <p>"Ah," exclaimed a listener, "I saw them but yesterday."</p>

  <p>"You would not know them today," vouchsafed the informer, "so terribly are
  their faces disfigured."</p>

  <p>When the press of humanity had been relieved Tarzan and Komodoflorensal
  continued their way, finding that the Slaves' Corridor lay just before them,
  and that it was down this avenue that the bodies of their victims of the
  previous night were being carried.</p>

  <p>"What," asked the ape-man, "did he mean by saying that they were being
  carried to the beasts?"</p>

  <p>"It is the way in which we dispose of the bodies of slaves," replied the
  Trohanadalmakusian. "They are carried to the edge of the jungle, where they
  are devoured by wild beasts. There are old and toothless lions near
  Trohanadalmakus that subsist entirely upon slave meat. They are our
  scavengers and so accustomed are they to being fed that they often come to
  meet the parties who bring out the corpses, pacing beside them, roaring and
  growling, until the spot is reached where the bodies are to be
  deposited."</p>

  <p>"You dispose of all your dead in this manner?"</p>

  <p>"Only the slave dead. The bodies of warriors and nobles are burned."</p>

  <p>"In a short time, then," continued Tarzan, "there will be no danger of
  there ever being a correct identification of those two," he jerked his thumb
  along the corridor ahead, where the bodies of the two dead warriors were
  being bounced and jolted along upon the backs of diadets.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"WHERE now?" demanded Komodoflorensal as the two emerged
  from the mouth of the Slaves' Corridor and stood for a moment in the
  brilliant sunlight without.</p>

  <p>"Lead the way to the quarry where we were confined and to the chamber in
  which we slept."</p>

  <p>"You must be weary of your brief liberty," remarked the
  Trohanadalmakusian.</p>

  <p>"We are returning for Talaskar, as I promised," Tarzan reminded him.</p>

  <p>"I know," said the Zertolosto, "and I commend your loyalty and valor while
  deprecating your judgment. It will be impossible to rescue Talaskar. Were it
  otherwise I should be the first to her assistance; but I know, and she knows,
  that, for her, escape is beyond hope. We will but succeed in throwing
  ourselves again into the hands of our masters."</p>

  <p>"Let us hope not," said Tarzan; "but, if you feel as you say, that our
  effort is foredoomed to failure and that we shall but be recaptured, do not
  accompany me. My only real need of you is to guide me to the apartment where
  Talaskar is confined. If you can direct me to it that is all I ask."</p>

  <p>"Think you I was attempting to evade the danger?" demanded
  Komodoflorensal. "No! Where you go, I will go. If you are captured I shall be
  captured. We shall fail, but let us not separate. I am ready to go wherever
  you go."</p>

  <p>"Good," commented Tarzan. "Now lead the way to the quarry and use your
  knowledge of things Minunian and your best wits to gain us entrance without
  too much talking."</p>

  <p>They passed, unchallenged, along the shaded walks between the domes of
  Veltopismakus and past the great parade where gorgeously caparisoned warriors
  were executing intricate evolutions with the nicest precision, and out beyond
  the domes along well-worn trails filled with toiling slaves and their haughty
  guards. Here they fell in beside the long column moving in the direction of
  the quarry in which they had been imprisoned, taking their places in the
  column of flanking guards, and thus they came to the entrance to the
  quarry.</p>

  <p>Perfunctorily the numbers of the slaves were taken, as they passed in, and
  entered in a great book; but to Tarzan's relief he noted that no attention
  was paid to the guards, who moved along beside their charges and down into
  the interior without being checked or even counted, and with them went
  Komodoflorensal, Prince Royal of Trohanadalmakus, and Tarzan of the Apes.</p>

  <p>Once inside the quarry and past the guard room the two fell gradually to
  the rear of the column, so that when it turned into a level above that which
  they wished to reach they were enabled to detach themselves from it without
  being noticed. To leave one column was but to join another, for there was no
  break in them and often there were several moving abreast; but when they
  reached the thirty-fifth level and entered the tunnel leading to the chamber
  in which Talaskar was confined they found themselves alone, since there is
  little or no activity in these corridors leading to slave quarters except
  early in the morning when the men are led forth to their labors and again at
  night when they are brought back.</p>

  <p>Before the door of the chamber they found a single warrior on guard. He
  was squatting on the floor of the tunnel leaning against the wall, but at
  their approach he rose and challenged them.</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal, who was in the lead, approached him and halted. "We have
  come for the slave girl, Talaskar," he said.</p>

  <p>Tarzan, who was just behind Komodoflorensal, saw a sudden light leap to
  the eyes of the warrior. Was it recognition?</p>

  <p>"Who sent you?" demanded the warrior.</p>

  <p>"Her master, Zoanthrohago," replied the Trohanadalmakusian.</p>

  <p>The expression upon the face of the warrior changed to one of cunning.</p>

  <p>"Go in and fetch her," he said, and unbolted the door, swinging it
  open.</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal dropped upon his hands and knees and crawled through the
  low aperture, but Tarzan stood where he was.</p>

  <p>"Go in!" said the guard to him.</p>

  <p>"I will remain where I am," replied the ape-man. "It will not require two
  of us to find a single slave girl and fetch her to the corridor."</p>

  <p>For an instant the warrior hesitated, then he closed the door hurriedly
  and shot the heavy bolts. When he turned toward Tarzan again, who was now
  alone with him in the corridor, he turned with a naked sword in his hands;
  but he found Zuanthrol facing him with drawn rapier.</p>

  <p>"Surrender!" cried the warrior. "I recognized you both instantly."</p>

  <p>"I thought as much," said Zuanthrol. "You are clever, with the exception
  of your eyes&mdash;they are fools, for they betray you."</p>

  <p>"But my sword is no fool," snapped the fellow, as he thrust viciously at
  the ape-man's breast.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Paul D'Arnot of the French navy had been recognized as one of
  the cleverest swordsmen in the service and to his friend Greystoke he had
  imparted a great measure of his skill during the many hours that the two had
  whiled away with the foils, and today Tarzan of the Apes breathed a prayer of
  gratitude to the far-distant friend whose careful training was, after many
  long years, to serve the ape-man in such good stead, for he soon realized
  that, though his antagonist was a master at the art of fence, he was not
  wholly outclassed, and to his skill was added his great strength and his
  agility.</p>

  <p>They had fought for but a minute or two when the Veltopismakusian realized
  that he was facing no mean antagonist and that he was laboring at a
  disadvantage. He being unable to fall back when Tarzan rushed him, while his
  foeman had at his back the whole length of the tunnel. He tried then to force
  Tarzan back, but in this he failed, receiving a thrust in the shoulder for
  his pains, and then he commenced to call for help and the ape-man realized
  that he must silence him and that quickly. Awaiting the opportunity that was
  presently afforded by a feint that evoked a wild lunge, Tarzan stepped
  quickly in and passed his sword through the heart of the Veltopismakusian and
  as he withdrew his blade from the body of his antagonist he released the
  bolts that held the door and swung it open. Beyond it, white of face,
  crouched Komodoflorensal, but as his eyes fell upon Tarzan and the body of
  the guard behind him, a smile curved his lips and an instant later he was in
  the corridor beside his friend.</p>

  <p>"How did it happen?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"He recognized us; but what of Talaskar? Is she not coming?"</p>

  <p>"She is not here. Kalfastoban took her away. He has purchased her from
  Zoanthrohago."</p>

  <p>Tarzan wheeled. "Rebolt the door and let us get out of here," he said.</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal closed and fastened the door. "Where now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"To find Kalfastoban's quarters," replied the ape-man.</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal shrugged his shoulders and followed on behind his friend.
  They retraced their steps toward the surface without incident until they were
  opposite the sixteenth level, when a face was suddenly turned toward them
  from a column of slaves crossing the runway from one lateral to another. Just
  for an instant did the eyes of the slave meet those of Tarzan, and then the
  fellow had passed into the mouth of the lateral and disappeared.</p>

  <p>"We must hurry," whispered Tarzan to his companion.</p>

  <p>"Why now more than before?" demanded Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"Did you not see the fellow who just passed us and turned to look a second
  time at me?"</p>

  <p>"No; who was it?"</p>

  <p>"Caraftap," replied Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"Did he recognize you?"</p>

  <p>"As to that I cannot say; but he evidently found something familiar in my
  appearance. Let us hope that he did not place me, though I fear that he
  did."</p>

  <p>"Then we must lose no time in getting out of here, and out of
  Veltopismakus, as well."</p>

  <p>They hurried on. "Where are Kalfastoban's quarters?" asked Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"I do not know. In Trohanadalmakus warriors are detailed to the quarries
  for but short periods and do not transfer their quarters or their slaves
  during the time that they are there. I do not know the custom here.
  Kalfastoban may have finished his tour of duty in the quarries. On the other
  hand it may be for a long period that they are detailed for that service and
  his quarters may lie on the upper level of the quarry. We shall have to
  inquire."</p>

  <p>Soon after this Tarzan stepped up to a warrior moving in the same
  direction as he and Komodoflorensal. "Where can I find Kalfastoban Vental?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>"They will tell you in the guard room, if it is any of your affair," he
  replied, shooting a quick glance at the two. "I do not know."</p>

  <p>After that they passed the fellow and at the first turn that hid them from
  him they increased their speed, for both were becoming suspicious of every
  least untoward incident, and their one wish now was to escape the quarry in
  safety. Nearing the entrance they attached themselves to a column of slaves
  toiling upward with their heavy burdens of rocks for the new dome, and with
  them they came to the guard room where the slaves were checked out. The
  officer and the clerks labored in a mechanical manner, and it appeared that
  it was to be as easy to leave the quarry as it had been to enter it, when the
  officer suddenly drew his brow together and commenced to count.</p>

  <p>"How many slaves in this crew?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"One hundred," replied one of the warriors accompanying them.</p>

  <p>"Then why four guards?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"There are but two of us," rejoined the warrior.</p>

  <p>"We are not with them," Komodoflorensal spoke up quickly.</p>

  <p>"What do you here?" demanded the officer.</p>

  <p>"If we can see you alone we can explain that quickly," replied the
  Trohanadalmakusian.</p>

  <p>The officer waved the crew of slaves upon their way and beckoned to
  Komodoflorensal and Tarzan to follow him into an adjoining chamber, where
  they found a small anteroom in which the commander of the guard slept.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said, "let me see your passes."</p>

  <p>"We have none," replied Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"No passes! That will be difficult to explain, will it not?"</p>

  <p>"Not to one of your discrimination," replied the prince, accidentally
  jingling the golden coins in his pouch. "We are in search of Kalfastoban. We
  understand that he owns a slave we wish to purchase and not being able to
  obtain a pass to the quarry in the short time at our disposal we ventured to
  come, upon so simple an errand, without one. Could you direct us to
  Kalfastoban?" Again he jingled the coins.</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted," replied the officer. "His quarters are upon the
  fifth level of the Royal Dome upon the central corridor and about midway
  between the King's Corridor and the Warrior's Corridor. As he was relieved
  from duty in the quarry this very morning I have no doubt but that you will
  find him there."</p>

  <p>"We thank you," said Komodoflorensal, leaning far back in the Minunian
  bow. "And now," he added, as though it was an afterthought, "if you will
  accept it we shall be filled with gratitude if you will permit us to leave
  this slight token of our appreciation," and he drew a large gold coin from
  the pouch and proffered it to the officer.</p>

  <p>"Rather than seem ungrateful," replied the officer, "I must accept your
  gracious gift, with which I may alleviate the sufferings of the poor. May the
  shadow of disaster never fall upon you!"</p>

  <p>The three then bowed and Tarzan and Komodoflorensal quitted the guard room
  and a moment later were in the free, fresh air of the surface.</p>

  <p>"Even in Minuni!" breathed Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" asked his friend.</p>

  <p>"I was just thinking of my simple, honest jungle and God's creatures that
  men call beasts."</p>

  <p>"What should they call them?" demanded Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"If judged by the standards that men themselves make, and fail to observe,
  they should be called demigods," replied the ape-man.</p>

  <p>"I believe I get your point," laughed the other, "but think! Had a lion
  guarded the entrance to this quarry no gold piece would have let us pass. The
  frailties of man are not without their virtues; because of them right has
  just triumphed over wrong and bribery has worn the vestments of virtue."</p>

  <p>Returning to the Royal Dome they passed around the east side of the
  structure to the north front, where lies the Slaves' Corridor in every dome.
  In quitting the dome they had come from the Warriors' Corridor on the west
  and they felt that it would be but increasing the chances of detection were
  they to pass too often along the same route where someone, half-recognizing
  them in one instance, might do so fully after a second or third
  inspection.</p>

  <p>To reach the fifth level required but a few minutes after they had gained
  entrance to the dome. With every appearance of boldness they made their way
  toward the point in the central corridor at which the officer of the guard
  had told them they would find Kalfastoban's quarters, and perhaps Kalfastoban
  himself; but they were constantly on the alert, for both recognized that the
  greatest danger of detection lay through the chance that Kalfastoban might
  recall their features, as he of all Veltopismakusians would be most apt to do
  so, since he had seen the most of them, or at least the most of Tarzan since
  he had donned the slave's green.</p>

  <p>They had reached a point about midway between the Slaves' Corridor and the
  Warriors' Corridor when Komodoflorensal halted a young, female slave and
  asked her where the quarters of Kalfastoban were located.</p>

  <p>"It is necessary to pass through the quarters of Hamadalban to reach those
  of Kalfastoban," replied the girl. "Go to the third entrance," and she
  pointed along the corridor in the direction they had been going.</p>

  <p>After they had left her Tarzan asked Komodoflorensal if he thought there
  would be any difficulty in gaining entrance to Kalfastoban's quarters.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied; "the trouble will arise in knowing what to do after we
  get there."</p>

  <p>"We know what we have come for," replied the ape-man. "It is only
  necessary to carry out our design, removing all obstacles as they
  intervene."</p>

  <p>"Quite simple," laughed the prince.</p>

  <p>Tarzan was forced to smile. "To be candid," he admitted, "I haven't the
  remotest idea what we are going to do after we get in there, or after we get
  out either, if we are successful in finding Talaskar and bringing her away
  with us, but that is not strange, since I know nothing, or practically
  nothing, of what conditions I may expect to confront me from moment to moment
  in this strange city of a strange world. All that we can do is to do our
  best. We have come thus far much more easily than I expected&mdash;perhaps we
  will go the whole distance with no greater friction&mdash;or we may stop
  within the next dozen steps, forever."</p>

  <p>Pausing before the third entrance they glanced in, discovering several
  women squatting upon the floor. Two of them were of the warrior class, the
  others slaves of the white tunic. Komodoflorensal entered boldly.</p>

  <p>"These are the quarters of Hamadalban?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"They are," replied one of the women.</p>

  <p>"And Kalfastoban's are beyond?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And beyond Kalfastoban's?" inquired the Trohanadalmakusian.</p>

  <p>"A long gallery leads to the outer corridor. Upon the gallery open many
  chambers where live hundreds of people. I do not know them all. Whom do you
  seek?"</p>

  <p>"Palastokar," replied Komodoflorensal quickly, choosing the first name
  that presented itself to his memory.</p>

  <p>"I do not recall the name," said the woman, knitting her brows in
  thought.</p>

  <p>"But I shall find him now, thanks to you," said Komodoflorensal, "for my
  directions were to pass through the quarters of Hamadalban and Kalfastoban,
  when I should come upon a gallery into which opened the quarters of
  Palastokar; but perhaps if Kalfastoban is in, he will be able to direct me
  more exactly."</p>

  <p>"Kalfastoban has gone out with Hamadalban," replied the woman; "but I
  expect them back momentarily. If you will wait, they will soon be here."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Komodoflorensal, hastily; "but I am sure that we shall
  have no trouble finding the quarters of Palastokar. May your candles burn
  long and brilliantly!" and without waiting on further ceremony he crossed the
  room and entered the quarters of Kalfastoban, into which Tarzan of the Apes
  followed at his heels.</p>

  <p>"I think, my friend," said the prince, "that we shall have to work
  rapidly."</p>

  <p>Tarzan glanced quickly around the first chamber that they entered. It was
  vacant. Several doors opened from it. They were all closed either with wooden
  doors or with hangings. The ape-man stepped quickly to the nearer and tried
  the latch. It gave and he pushed the door ajar. All was darkness within.</p>

  <p>"Bring a candle, Komodoflorensal," he said.</p>

  <p>The prince brought two from their niches in the wall. "A storeroom," he
  said, as the rays of the candles illuminated the interior of the room. "Food
  and candles and raiment. Kalfastoban is no pauper. The tax collector has not
  ruined him yet."</p>

  <p>Tarzan, standing in the doorway of the storeroom, just behind
  Komodoflorensal, turned suddenly and looked out across the other chamber. He
  had heard voices in the quarters of Hamadalban beyond&mdash;men's voices. One
  of them he recognized an instant later&mdash;it was the voice of Kalfastoban
  Vental.</p>

  <p>"Come!" roared the bull voice of the Vental. "Come to my quarters,
  Hamadalban, and I will show you this new slave of mine."</p>

  <p>Tarzan pushed Komodoflorensal into the storeroom and following him, closed
  the door. "Did you hear?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was Kalfastoban!"</p>

  <p>The storeroom door was ornamented with a small,
  open grill covered with a hanging of some heavy stuff upon the inside. By
  drawing the hanging aside the two could obtain a view of most of the interior
  of the outer chamber, and they could hear all that was said by the two men
  who now entered from Hamadalban's quarters.</p>

  <p>"I tell you she is the greatest bargain I have ever seen," cried
  Kalfastoban, "but wait, I'll fetch her," and he stepped to another door,
  which he unlocked with a key. "Come out!" he roared, flinging the door
  wide.</p>

  <p>With the haughty bearing of a queen a girl stepped slowly into the larger
  room&mdash;no cowering servility of the slave here. Her chin was high, her
  gaze level. She glanced almost with contempt upon the Vental. And she was
  beautiful. It was Talaskar. Komodoflorensal realized that he had never before
  appreciated how really beautiful was the little slave girl, who had cooked
  for him. Kalfastoban had given her a white tunic of good quality, which set
  off the olive of her skin and the rich blackness of her hair to better effect
  than had the cheap green thing that he had always seen her in.</p><a id=

    <p class="caption">With the haughty bearing of a queen a girl stepped
    slowly into the larger room.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"She belonged to Zoanthrohago," Kalfastoban explained to his friend, "but
  I doubt that he ever saw her, else he never would have parted with her for
  the paltry sum I paid."</p>

  <p>"You will take her for your own woman and raise her to our class?" asked
  Hamadalban.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Kalfastoban, "for then she would no longer be a slave and I
  could not sell her. Women are too expensive. I shall keep her for a time and
  then sell her while her value is still high. I should make a pretty profit
  from her."</p>

  <p>Tarzan's fingers closed tightly, as though upon the throat of an enemy,
  and the right hand of Komodoflorensal crept to the hilt of his rapier.</p>

  <p>A woman came from the quarters of Hamadalban and stood in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Two of the guards from the quarry are here with a green slave inquiring
  for Kalfastoban," she said.</p>

  <p>"Send them in," directed the Vental.</p>

  <p>A moment later the three entered&mdash;the slave was Caraftap.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Kalfastoban, "my good slave, Caraftap; the best in the
  quarry. Why is he brought here?"</p>

  <p>"He says that he has information of great value," replied one of the
  guard; "but he will divulge it to none but you. He has staked his life
  against the worth of his information and the Novand of the guard ordered him
  brought hither."</p>

  <p>"What information have you?" demanded Kalfastoban.</p>

  <p>"It is of great moment," cried Caraftap. "Noble Zoanthrohago, and even the
  king, will be grateful for it; but were I to give it and have to return to
  the quarries the other slaves would kill me. You were always good to me,
  Kalfastoban Vental, and so I asked to be brought to you, for I know that if
  you promise that I shall be rewarded with the white tunic, if my service is
  considered worthy of it, I shall be safe."</p>

  <p>"You know that I cannot do that," replied Kalfastoban.</p>

  <p>"But the king can, and if you intercede with him he will not refuse."</p>

  <p>"I can promise to intercede with the king in your behalf if the
  information you bring is of value; but that is all I can do."</p>

  <p>"That is enough&mdash;if you promise," said Caraftap.</p>

  <p>"Very well, I promise. What do you know that the king would like to
  know?"</p>

  <p>"News travels fast in Veltopismakus," said Caraftap, "and so it was that
  we in the quarry heard of the death of the two slaves, Aoponato and
  Zuanthrol, within a short time after their bodies were discovered. As both
  had been slaves of Zoanthrohago we were all confined together in one chamber
  and thus I knew them both well. Imagine then my surprise when, while crossing
  one of the main spirals with a crew of other slaves, I beheld both Zuanthrol
  and Aoponato, in the habiliments of warriors, ascending toward the
  surface."</p>

  <p>"What is the appearance of these two?" suddenly demanded one of the
  warriors who had accompanied Caraftap from the quarry.</p>

  <p>The slave described them as fully as he could.</p>

  <p>"The same!" cried the warrior. "These very two stopped me upon the spiral
  and inquired the whereabouts of Kalfastoban."</p>

  <p>A crowd of women and men had gathered in the doorway of Kalfastoban's
  chamber, having been attracted by the presence of a green slave accompanied
  by members of the quarry guard. One of them was a young slave girl.</p>

  <p>"I, too, was questioned by these very men," she exclaimed, "only a short
  time since, and they asked me the same question."</p>

  <p>One of Hamadalban's women voiced a little scream. "They passed through our
  quarters but a moment since," she cried, "and entered Kalfastoban's, but they
  asked not where lay the quarters of Kalfastoban, the name they mentioned was
  unknown to me&mdash;a strange name."</p>

  <p>"Palastokar," one of her companions reminded her.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Palastokar, and they said he had his quarters upon the gallery
  leading from Kalfastoban's to the outer corridor."</p>

  <p>"There is no one of such a name in the Royal Dome," said Kalfastoban. "It
  was but a ruse to enter my quarters."</p>

  <p>"Or to pass through them," suggested one of the quarry guard.</p>

  <p>"We must hurry after them," said the other.</p>

  <p>"Keep Caraftap here until we return, Kalfastoban," said the first guard,
  "and also search your own quarters and those adjoining carefully. Come!" and
  motioning to the other guard he crossed the chamber and departed along the
  gallery that led to the outer corridor, followed not alone by his fellow but
  by Hamadalban and all the other men who had congregated in the chamber,
  leaving Kalfastoban and Caraftap, with the women, in the Vental's
  quarters.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">KALFASTOBAN turned immediately to a search of the various
  chambers of his quarters, but Caraftap laid a restraining hand upon his
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Wait, Vental," he begged. "If they be here would it not be best to insure
  their capture by fastening the doors leading from your quarters?"</p>

  <p>"A good thought, Caraftap," replied Kalfastoban, "and then we may take our
  time searching for them. Out of here, all you women!" he cried, waving the
  females back into Hamadalban's quarters. A moment later the two doors leading
  from the chamber to Hamadalban's quarters and the gallery were closed and
  locked.</p>

  <p>"And now, master," suggested Caraftap, "as there be two of them would it
  not be well to supply me with a weapon."</p>

  <p>Kalfastoban smote his chest. "A dozen such could Kalfastoban overcome
  alone," he cried; "but for your own protection get you a sword from yonder
  room while I lock this proud she-cat in her cell again."</p>

  <p>As Kalfastoban followed Talaskar to the room in which she had been
  confined, Caraftap crossed to the door of the storeroom where the Vental had
  told him he would find a weapon.</p>

  <p>The Vental reached the door of the room just behind the girl and reaching
  out caught her by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Not so fast, my pretty!" he cried. "A kiss before you leave me; but fret
  not! The moment we are sure that those villainous slaves are not within these
  rooms I shall join you, so do not pine for your Kalfastoban."</p>

  <p>Talaskar wheeled and struck the Vental in the face. "Lay not your filthy
  hands upon me, beast!" she cried, and struggled to free herself from his
  grasp.</p>

  <p>"So-ho! a cat, indeed!" exclaimed the man, but he did not release her, and so
  they struggled until they disappeared from sight within the cell, and at the
  same moment Caraftap, the slave, laid his hand upon the latch of the
  storeroom door, and opening it stepped within.</p>

  <p>As he did so steel fingers reached forth out of the darkness and closed
  upon his throat. He would have screamed in terror, but no sound could he
  force through his tight-closed throat. He struggled and struck at the thing
  that held him&mdash;a thing so powerful that he knew it could not be human,
  and then a low voice, cold and terrifying, whispered in his ear.</p>

  <p>"Die, Caraftap!" it said. "Meet the fate that you deserve and that you
  well knew you deserved when you said that you dared not return to the
  quarters of the slaves of Zoanthrohago after betraying two of your number.
  Die, Caraftap! and know before you die that he whom you would have betrayed
  is your slayer. You searched for Zuanthrol and&mdash;you have found him!"
  With the last word the terrible fingers closed upon the man's neck.
  Spasmodically the slave struggled, fighting for air. Then the two hands that
  gripped him turned slowly in opposite directions and the head of the traitor
  was twisted from his body.</p>

  <p>Throwing the corpse aside Tarzan sprang into the main chamber of the
  Vental's quarters and ran quickly toward the door of Talaskar's cell,
  Komodoflorensal but half a pace behind him. The door of the little room had
  been pushed to by the struggles of the couple within, and as Tarzan pushed it
  open he saw the girl in the clutches of the huge Vental, who, evidently
  maddened by her resistance, had lost his temper completely and was attempting
  to rain blows upon her face, which she sought to ward off, clutching at his
  arms and hands.</p>

  <p>A heavy hand fell upon the shoulder of the Vental. "You seek us!" a low
  voice whispered in his ear. "Here we are!"</p>

  <p>Kalfastoban released the girl and swung around, at the same time reaching
  for his sword. Facing him were the two slaves and both were armed, though
  only Aoponato had drawn his weapon. Zuanthrol, who held him, had not yet
  drawn.</p>

  <p>"'A dozen such could Kalfastoban overcome alone,'" quoted Tarzan. "Here we
  are, braggart, and we are only two; but we cannot wait while you show us how
  mighty you be. We are sorry. Had you not molested this girl I should merely
  have locked you in your quarters, from which you would soon have been
  released; but your brutality deserves but one punishment&mdash;death."</p>

  <p>"Caraftap!" screamed Kalfastoban. No longer was he a blusterer, deep-toned
  and swaggering. His voice was shrill with terror and he shook in the hands of
  the ape-man. "Caraftap! Help!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Caraftap is dead," said Tarzan. "He died because he betrayed his fellows.
  You shall die because you were brutal to a defenseless slave girl. Run him
  through, Komodoflorensal! We have no time to waste here."</p>

  <p>As the Trohanadalmakusian withdrew his sword from the heart of Kalfastoban
  Vental and the corpse slid to the floor of the cell Talaskar ran forward and
  fell at the feet of the ape-man.</p>

  <p>"Zuanthrol and Aoponato!" she cried. "Never did I think to see you again.
  What has happened? Why are you here? You have saved me, but now you will be
  lost. Fly&mdash;I know not where to you may fly&mdash;but go from here! Do
  not let them find you here. I cannot understand why you are here,
  anyway."</p>

  <p>"We are trying to escape," explained Komodoflorensal, "and Zuanthrol would
  not go without you. He searched the quarry for you and now the Royal Dome. He
  has performed the impossible, but he has found you."</p>

  <p>"Why did you do this for me?" asked Talaskar, looking wonderingly at
  Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"Because you were kind to me when I was brought to the chamber of
  Zoanthrohago's slaves," replied the ape-man, "and because I promised that
  when the time for escape came we three should be together."</p>

  <p>He had lifted her to her feet and led her into the main chamber.
  Komodoflorensal stood a little aside, his eyes upon the floor. Tarzan glanced
  at him and an expression of puzzlement came into the eyes of the ape-man, but
  whatever thought had caused it he must have put quickly aside for the
  consideration of more pressing matters.</p>

  <p>"Komodoflorensal, you know best what avenues of escape should be the least
  beset by the dangers of discovery. Whether to go by way of Hamadalban's
  quarters or through the gallery they mentioned? These are questions I cannot
  answer to my own satisfaction; and look!" his eyes had been roving about the
  chamber, "there is an opening in the ceiling. Where might that lead?"</p>

  <p>"It might lead almost anywhere, or nowhere at all!" replied the
  Trohanadalmakusian. "Many chambers have such openings. Sometimes they lead
  into small lofts that are not connected with any other chamber; again they
  lead into secret chambers, or even into corridors upon another level."</p>

  <p>There came a pounding upon the door leading into Hamadalban's quarters and
  a woman's voice called aloud: "Kalfastoban, open!" she cried. "There has come
  an ental from the quarry guard in search of Caraftap. The sentry at the
  entrance to the quarters of the slaves of Zoanthrohago has been found slain
  and they wish to question Caraftap, believing that there is a conspiracy
  among the slaves."</p>

  <p>"We must go by the gallery," whispered Komodoflorensal, stepping quickly
  to the door leading thereto.</p>

  <p>As he reached it someone laid a hand upon the latch from the opposite side
  and attempted to open the door, which was locked.</p>

  <p>"Kalfastoban!" cried a voice from the gallery beyond. "Let us in! The
  slaves went not this way. Come, open quickly!"</p>

  <p>Tarzan of the Apes glanced quickly about. Upon his face was a half-snarl,
  for once again was he the cornered beast. He measured the distance from the
  floor to the trap in the ceiling, and then with a little run he sprang
  lightly upward. He had forgotten to what extent the reduction of his weight
  affected his agility. He had hoped to reach a handhold upon the upper edge of
  the opening, but instead he shot entirely through it, alighting upon his feet
  in a dark chamber. Turning he looked down at his friends below. Consternation
  was writ large upon the countenance of each; but at that he could not wonder.
  He was almost as much surprised himself.</p>

  <p>"Is it too far for you to jump?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Too far!" they replied.</p>

  <p>He swung, then, head downward through the opening, catching the edge of
  the trap in the hollow of his knees. At the gallery door the knocking was
  becoming insistent and now at that leading into the quarters of Hamadalban a
  man's voice had supplanted that of the woman. The fellow was demanding
  entrance, angrily.</p>

  <p>"Open!" he shouted. "In the name of the king, open!"</p>

  <p>"Open yourself!" shouted the fellow who had been hammering at the opposite
  door, thinking that the demand to open came from the interior of the chamber
  to which he sought admission.</p>

  <p>"How can I open?" screamed back the other. "The door is locked upon your
  side!"</p>

  <p>"It is not locked upon my side. It is locked upon yours," cried the other,
  angrily.</p>

  <p>"You lie!" shouted he who sought entrance from Hamadalban's quarters, "and
  you will pay well when this is reported to the king."</p>

  <p>Tarzan swung, head downward, into the chamber, his hands extended toward
  his companions. "Lift Talaskar to me," he directed Komodoflorensal, and as
  the other did so he grasped the girl's wrists and raised her as far as he
  could until she could seize upon a part of his leather harness and support
  herself alone without falling. Then he took another hold upon her, lower
  down, and lifted still higher, and in this way she managed to clamber into
  the chamber above.</p><a id="pic28"

    <p class="caption">"Lift Talaskar to me," Tarzan directed.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The angry warriors at the two doors were now evidently engaged in an
  attempt to batter their way into the chamber. Heavy blows were falling upon
  the substantial panels that threatened to splinter them at any moment.</p>

  <p>"Fill your pouch with candles, Komodoflorensal," said Tarzan, "and then
  jump for my hands."</p>

  <p>"I took all the candles I could carry while we were in the storeroom,"
  replied the other. "Brace yourself! I am going to jump."</p>

  <p>A panel splintered and bits of wood flew to the center of the floor from
  the door at the gallery just as Tarzan seized the outstretched hands of
  Komodoflorensal and an instant later, as both men kneeled in the darkness of
  the loft and looked down into the chamber below the opposite door flew open
  and the ten warriors who composed the ental burst in at the heels of their
  Vental.</p>

  <p>For an instant they looked about in blank surprise and then their
  attention was attracted by the pounding upon the other door. A smile crossed
  the face of the Vental as he stepped quickly to the gallery door and unlocked
  it. Angry warriors rushed in upon him, but when he had explained the
  misapprehension under which both parties had been striving for entrance to
  the chamber they all joined in the laughter, albeit a trifle
  shamefacedly.</p>

  <p>"But who was in here?" demanded the Vental who had brought the soldiers
  from the quarry.</p>

  <p>"Kalfastoban and the green slave Caraftap," proffered a woman belonging to
  Hamadalban.</p>

  <p>"They must be hiding!" said a warrior.</p>

  <p>"Search the quarters!" commanded the Vental.</p>

  <p>"It will not take long to find one," said another warrior, pointing at the
  floor just inside the storeroom doorway.</p>

  <p>The others looked and there they saw a human hand resting upon the floor.
  The fingers seemed frozen into the semblance of clutching claws. Mutely they
  proclaimed death. One of the warriors stepped quickly to the storeroom,
  opened the door and dragged forth the body of Caraftap, to which the head was
  clinging by a shred of flesh. Even the warriors stepped back, aghast. They
  looked quickly around the chamber.</p>

  <p>"Both doors were barred upon the inside," said the Vental. "Whatever did
  this must still be here."</p>

  <p>"It could have been nothing human," whispered a woman who had followed
  them from the adjoining quarters.</p>

  <p>"Search carefully," said the Vental, and as he was a brave man, he went
  first into one chamber and then another. In the first one they found
  Kalfastoban, run through the heart.</p>

  <p>"It is time we got out of here if there is any way out," whispered Tarzan
  to Komodoflorensal. "One of them will espy this hole directly."</p>

  <p>Very cautiously the two men felt their way in opposite direction around
  the walls of the dark, stuffy loft. Deep dust, the dust of ages, rose about
  them, chokingly, evidencing the fact that the room had not been used for
  years, perhaps for ages. Presently Komodoflorensal heard a "H-s-s-t!" from
  the ape-man who called them to him. "Come here, both of you. I have found
  something."</p>

  <p>"What have you found?" asked Talaskar, coming close.</p>

  <p>"An opening near the bottom of the wall," replied Tarzan. "It is large
  enough for a man to crawl through. Think you, Komodoflorensal, that it would
  be safe to light a candle?"</p>

  <p>"No, not now," replied the prince.</p>

  <p>"I will go without it then," announced the ape-man, "for we must see where
  this tunnel leads, if anywhere."</p>

  <p>He dropped upon his hands and knees, then, and Talaskar, who had been
  standing next him, felt him move away. She could not see him&mdash;it was too
  dark in the gloomy loft.</p>

  <p>The two waited, but Zuanthrol did not return. They heard voices in the
  room below. They wondered if the searchers would soon investigate the loft
  but really there was no need for apprehension. The searchers had determined
  to invest the place&mdash;it would be safer than crawling into that dark hole
  after an unknown thing that could tear the head from a man's body. When it
  came down, as come down it would have to, they would be prepared to destroy
  or capture it; but in the meantime they were content to wait.</p>

  <p>"What has become of him?" whispered Talaskar, anxiously.</p>

  <p>"You care very much for him, do you not?" asked Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"Why should I not?" asked the girl. "You do, too, do you not?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"He is very wonderful," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"I wish he would come back," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>As though in answer to their wish they heard a low whistle from the depths
  of the tunnel into which Tarzan had crawled. "Come!" whispered the
  ape-man.</p>

  <p>Talaskar first, they followed him, crawling upon hands and knees through a
  winding tunnel, feeling their way through the darkness, until at last a light
  flared before them and they saw Zuanthrol lighting a candle in a small
  chamber, that was only just high enough to permit a tall man to sit erect
  within it.</p>

  <p>"I got this far," he said to them, "and as it offered a fair hiding place
  where we might have light without fear of discovery I came back after you.
  Here we can stop a while in comparative comfort and safety until I can
  explore the tunnel further. From what I have been able to judge it has never
  been used during the lifetime of any living Veltopismakusian, so there is
  little likelihood that anyone will think of looking here for us."</p>

  <p>"Do you think they will follow us?" asked Talaskar.</p>

  <p>"I think they will," replied Komodoflorensal, "and as we cannot go back it
  will be better if we push on at once, as it is reasonable to assume that the
  opposite end of this tunnel opens into another chamber. Possibly there we
  shall find an avenue of escape."</p>

  <p>"You are right, Komodoflorensal," agreed Tarzan. "Nothing can be gained by
  remaining here. I will go ahead. Let Talaskar follow me, and you bring up the
  rear. If the place proves a blind alley we shall be no worse off for having
  investigated it."</p>

  <p>Lighting their way this time with candles the three crawled laboriously
  and painfully over the uneven, rock floor of the tunnel, which turned often,
  this way and that, as though passing around chambers, until, to their relief,
  the passageway abruptly enlarged, both in width and height, so that now they
  could proceed in an erect position. The tunnel now dropped in a steep
  declivity to a lower level and a moment later the three emerged into a small
  chamber, where Talaskar suddenly placed a hand upon Tarzan's arm, with a
  little intaking of her breath in a half gasp.</p>

  <p>"What is that, Zuanthrol!" she whispered, pointing into the darkness
  ahead.</p>

  <p>Upon the floor at one side of the room a crouching figure was barely
  discernible close to the wall.</p>

  <p>"And that!" exclaimed the girl, pointing to another portion of the
  room.</p>

  <p>The ape-man shook her hand from his arm and stepped quickly forward, his
  candle held high in his left hand, his right upon his sword. He came close to
  the crouching figure and bent to examine it. He laid his hand upon it and it
  fell into a heap of dust.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" demanded the girl.</p>

  <p>"It <i>was</i> a man," replied Tarzan; "but it has been dead many years. It was
  chained to this wall. Even the chain has rusted away."</p>

  <p>"And the other, too?" asked Talaskar.</p>

  <p>"There are several of them," said Komodoflorensal. "See? There and
  there."</p>

  <p>"At least they cannot detain us," said Tarzan, and moved on again across
  the chamber toward a doorway on the opposite side.</p>

  <p>"But they tell us something, possibly," ventured Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"What do they say?" asked the ape-man.</p>

  <p>"That this corridor connected with the quarters of a very powerful
  Veltopismakusian," replied the prince. "So powerful was he that he might
  dispose of his enemies thus, without question; and it also tells us that all
  this happened long years ago."</p>

  <p>"The condition of the bodies told us that," said Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"Not entirely," replied Komodoflorensal. "The ants would have reduced them
  to that state in a short time. In past ages the dead were left within the
  domes, and the ants, who were then our scavengers, soon disposed of them, but
  the ants sometimes attacked the living. They grew from a nuisance to a
  menace, and then every precaution had to be taken to keep from attracting
  them. Also we fought them. There were great battles waged in Trohanadalmakus
  between the Minunians and the ants and thousands of our warriors were
  devoured alive, and though we slew billions of ants their queens could
  propagate faster than we could kill the sexless workers who attacked us with
  their soldiers. But at last we turned our attention to their nests. Here the
  carnage was terrific, but we succeeded in slaying their queens and since then
  no ants have come into our domes. They live about us, but they fear us.
  However, we do not risk attracting them again by leaving our dead within the
  domes."</p>

  <p>"Then you believe that this corridor leads to the quarters of some great
  noble?" inquired Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"I believe that it once did. The ages bring change. Its end may now be
  walled up. The chamber to which it leads may have housed a king's son when
  these bones were quick; today it may be a barrack-room for soldiers, or a
  stable for diadets. About all that we know definitely about it," concluded
  Komodoflorensal, "is that it has not been used by man for a long time, and
  probably, therefore, is unknown to present-day Veltopismakusians."</p>

  <p>Beyond the chamber of death the tunnel dropped rapidly to lower levels,
  entering, at last, a third chamber larger than either of the others. Upon the
  floor lay the bodies of many men.</p>

  <p>"These were not chained to the walls," remarked Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"No, they died fighting, as one may see by their naked swords and the
  position of their bones."</p>

  <p>As the three paused a moment to look about the chamber there fell upon
  their ears the sound of a human voice.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS the days passed and Tarzan did not return to his home his
  son became more and more apprehensive. Runners were sent to nearby villages,
  but each returned with the same report. No one had seen The Big Bwana. Korak
  dispatched messages, then, to the nearest telegraph inquiring from all the
  principal points in Africa, where the ape-man might have made a landing, if
  aught had been seen or heard of him; but always again were the answers in the
  negative.</p>

  <p>And at last, stripped to a string and carrying naught but his primitive
  weapons, Korak the Killer took the trail with a score of the swiftest and
  bravest of the Waziri in search of his father. Long and diligently they
  searched the jungle and the forest, often enlisting the friendly services of
  the villages near which they chanced to be carrying on their quest, until
  they had covered as with a fine-toothed comb a vast area of country, covered
  it as could have no other body of men; but for all their care and all their
  diligence they uncovered no single clue as to the fate or whereabouts of
  Tarzan of the Apes, and so, disheartened yet indefatigable, they searched on
  and on through tangled miles of steaming jungle or across rocky uplands as
  inhospitable as the stunted thorns that dotted them.</p>

  <p><br>
  AND in the Royal Dome of Elkomoelhago, Thagosto of Veltopismakus, three
  people halted in a rock-walled, hidden chamber and listened to a human voice
  that appeared to come to them out of the very rock of the walls surrounding
  them. Upon the floor about them lay the bones of long-dead men. About them
  rose the impalpable dust of ages.</p>

  <p>The girl pressed closer to Tarzan. "Who is it?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>Tarzan shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is a woman's voice," said Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>The ape-man raised his candle high above his head and took a step closer
  to the left-hand wall; then he stopped and pointed. The others looked in the
  direction indicated by Tarzan's finger and saw an opening in the wall a hual
  or two above his head. Tarzan handed his candle to Komodoflorensal, removed
  his sword and laid it on the floor, and then sprang lightly for the opening.
  For a moment he clung to its edge, listening, and then he dropped back into
  the chamber.</p>

  <p>"It is pitch-black beyond," he said. "Whoever owns that voice is in
  another chamber beyond that into which I was just looking. There was no human
  being in the next apartment."</p>

  <p>"If it was absolutely dark, how could you know that?" demanded
  Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"Had there been anyone there I should have smelled him," replied the
  ape-man.</p>

  <p>The others looked at him in astonishment. "I am sure of it," said Tarzan,
  "because I could plainly feel a draught sucking up from the chamber, through
  the aperture, and into this chamber. Had there been a human being there his
  effluvium would have been carried directly to my nostrils."</p>

  <p>"And you could have detected it?" demanded Komodoflorensal. "My friend, I
  can believe much of you, but not that!"</p>

  <p>Tarzan smiled. "I at least have the courage of my convictions," he said,
  "for I am going over there to investigate. From the clearness with which the
  voice comes to us I am certain that it comes through no solid wall. There
  must be an opening into the chamber where the woman is and as we should
  investigate every possible avenue of escape, I shall investigate this." He
  stepped again toward the wall below the aperture.</p>

  <p>"Oh, let us not separate," cried the girl. "Where one goes, let us all
  go!"</p>

  <p>"Two swords are better than one," said Komodoflorensal, though his tone
  was only halfhearted.</p>

  <p>"Very well," replied Tarzan. "I will go first, and then you can pass
  Talaskar up to me."</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal nodded. A minute or two later the three stood upon the
  opposite side of the wall. Their candle revealed a narrow passage that showed
  indications of much more recent use than those through which they had passed
  from the quarters of Kalfastoban. The wall they had passed through to reach
  it was of stone, but that upon the opposite side was of studding and rough
  boards.</p>

  <p>"This is a passage built along the side of a paneled room," whispered
  Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"The other side of these rough boards supports beautifully polished panels
  of brilliant woods or burnished metals."</p>

  <p>"Then there should be a door, you think, opening from this passage into
  the adjoining chamber?" asked Tarzan.</p>

  <p>"A secret panel, more likely," he replied.</p>

  <p>They walked along the passage, listening intently. At first they had just
  been able to distinguish that the voice they heard was that of a woman; but
  now they heard the words.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;had they let me have him," were the first that they
  distinguished.</p>

  <p>"Most glorious mistress, this would not have happened then," replied
  another female voice.</p>

  <p>"Zoanthrohago is a fool and deserves to die; but my illustrious father,
  the king, is a bigger fool," spoke the first voice. "He will kill
  Zoanthrohago and with him the chance of discovering the secret of making our
  warriors giants. Had they let me buy this Zuanthrol he would not have
  escaped. They thought that I would have killed him, but that was farthest
  from my intentions."</p>

  <p>"What would you have done with him, wondrous Princess?"</p>

  <p>"That is not for a slave to ask or know," snapped the mistress.</p>

  <p>For a time there was silence.</p>

  <p>"That is the Princess Janzara speaking," whispered Tarzan to
  Komodoflorensal. "It is the daughter of Elkomoelhago whom you would have
  captured and made your princess; but you would have had a handful."</p>

  <p>"Is she as beautiful as they say?" asked Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"She is very beautiful, but she is a devil."</p>

  <p>"It would have been my duty to take her," said Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>Tarzan was silent. A plan was unfolding itself within his mind. The voice
  from beyond the partition spoke again.</p>

  <p>"He was very wonderful," it said. "Much more wonderful than our warriors,"
  and then, after a silence, "You may go, slave, and see to it that I am not
  disturbed before the sun stands midway between the Women's Corridor and the
  King's Corridor."</p>

  <p>"May your candles burn as deathlessly as your beauty, Princess," said the
  slave, as she backed across the apartment.</p>

  <p>An instant later the three behind the paneling heard a door close.</p>

  <p>Tarzan crept stealthily along the passage, seeking the secret panel that
  connected the apartment where the Princess Janzara lay composed for the
  night; but it was Talaskar who found it.</p>

  <p>"Here!" she whispered and together the three examined the fastening. It
  was simple and could evidently be opened from the opposite side by pressure
  upon a certain spot in the panel.</p>

  <p>"Wait here!" said Tarzan to his companions. "I am going to fetch the
  Princess Janzara. If we cannot escape with her we should be able to buy our
  liberty with such a hostage."</p>

  <p>Without waiting to discuss the advisability of his action with the others,
  Tarzan gently slid back the catch that held the panel and pushed it slightly
  ajar. Before him was the apartment of Janzara&mdash;a creation of gorgeous
  barbarity in the center of which, upon a marble slab, the princess lay upon
  her back, a gigantic candle burning at her head and another at her feet.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the luxuriousness of their surroundings, of their wealth, or
  their positions in life, the Minunians never sleep upon a substance softer
  than a single thickness of fabric, which they throw upon the ground, or upon
  wooden, stone, or marble sleeping slabs, depending upon their caste and their
  wealth.</p>

  <p>Leaving the panel open the ape-man stepped quietly into the apartment and
  moved directly toward the princess, who lay with closed eyes, either already
  asleep, or assiduously wooing Morpheus. He had crossed halfway to her cold
  couch when a sudden draught closed the panel with a noise that might well
  have awakened the dead.</p>

  <p>Instantly the princess was on her feet and facing him. For a moment she
  stood in silence gazing at him and then she moved slowly toward him, the
  sinuous undulations of her graceful carriage suggesting to the Lord of the
  Jungle a similarity to the savage majesty of Sabor, the lioness.</p>

  <p>"It is you, Zuanthrol!" breathed the princess. "You have come for me?"</p>

  <p>"I have come for you, Princess," replied the ape-man. "Make no outcry and
  no harm will befall you."</p>

  <p>"I will make no outcry," whispered Janzara as with half-closed lids she
  glided to him and threw her arms about his neck.</p>

  <p>Tarzan drew back and gently disengaged himself. "You do not understand,
  Princess," he told her. "You are my prisoner. You are coming with me."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she breathed, "I am your prisoner, but it is you who do not
  understand. I love you. It is my right to choose whatever slave I will to be
  my prince. I have chosen you."</p>

  <p>Tarzan shook his head impatiently. "You do not love me," he said. "I am
  sorry that you think you do, for I do not love you. I have no time to waste.
  Come!" and he stepped closer to take her by the wrist.</p>

  <p>Her eyes narrowed. "Are you mad?" she demanded. "Or can it be that you do
  not know who I am?"</p>

  <p>"You are Janzara, daughter of Elkomoelhago," replied Tarzan. "I know well
  who you are."</p>

  <p>"And you dare to spurn my love!" She was breathing heavily, her breasts
  rising and falling to the tumultuous urge of her emotions.</p>

  <p>"It is no question of love between us," replied the ape-man. "To me it is
  only a question of liberty and life for myself and my companions."</p>

  <p>"You love another?" questioned Janzara.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Tarzan told her.</p>

  <p>"Who is she?" demanded the princess.</p>

  <p>"Will you come quietly, or shall I be compelled to carry you away by
  force?" asked the ape-man, ignoring her question.</p>

  <p>For a moment the woman stood silently before him, her every muscle tensed,
  her dark eyes two blazing wells of fire, and then slowly her expression
  changed. Her face softened and she stretched one hand toward him.</p>

  <p>"I will help you, Zuanthrol," she said. "I will help you to escape.
  Because I love you I shall do this. Come! Follow me!" She turned and moved
  softly across the apartment.</p>

  <p>"But my companions," said the ape-man. "I cannot go without them."</p>

  <p>"Where are they?"</p>

  <p>He did not tell her, for as yet he was none too sure of her motives.</p>

  <p>"Show me the way," he said, "and I can return for them."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied, "I will show you and then perhaps you will love me
  better than you love the other."</p>

  <p>In the passage behind the paneling Talaskar and Komodoflorensal awaited
  the outcome of Tarzan's venture. Distinctly to their ears came every word of
  the conversation between the ape-man and the princess.</p>

  <p>"He loves you," said Komodoflorensal. "You see, he loves you."</p>

  <p>"I see nothing of the kind," returned Talaskar. "Because he does not love
  the Princess Janzara is no proof that he loves me."</p>

  <p>"But he does love you&mdash;and you love him! I have seen it since first
  he came. Would that he were not my friend, for then I might run him
  through."</p>

  <p>"Why would you run him through because he loves me&mdash;if he does?"
  demanded the girl. "Am I so low that you would rather see your friend dead
  than mated with me?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;" he hesitated. "I cannot tell you what I mean."</p>

  <p>The girl laughed, and then suddenly sobered. "She is leading him from her
  apartment. We had better follow."</p>

  <p>As Talaskar laid her fingers upon the spring that actuated the lock
  holding the panel in place, Janzara led Tarzan across her chamber toward a
  doorway in one of the side walls&mdash;not the doorway through which her
  slave had departed.</p>

  <p>"Follow me," whispered the princess, "and you will see what the love of
  Janzara means."</p>

  <p>Tarzan, not entirely assured of her intentions, followed her warily.</p>

  <p>"You are afraid," she said. "You do not trust me! Well, come here then and
  look, yourself, into this chamber before you enter."</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal and Talaskar had but just stepped into the apartment when
  Tarzan approached the door to one side of which Janzara stood. They saw the
  floor give suddenly beneath his feet and an instant later Zuanthrol had
  disappeared. As he shot down a polished chute he heard a wild laugh from
  Janzara following him into the darkness of the unknown.</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal and Talaskar leaped quickly across the chamber, but too
  late. The floor that had given beneath Tarzan's feet had slipped quietly back
  into place. Janzara stood above the spot trembling with anger and staring
  down at the place where the ape-man had disappeared. She shook as an aspen
  shakes in the breeze&mdash;shook in the mad tempest of her own passions.</p>

  <p>"If you will not come to me you shall never go to another!" she screamed,
  and then she turned and saw Komodoflorensal and Talaskar running toward her.
  What followed occurred so quickly that it would be impossible to record the
  facts in the brief time that they actually consumed. It was over almost
  before Tarzan reached the bottom of the chute and picked himself from the
  earthen floor upon which he had been deposited.</p>

  <p>The room in which he found himself was lighted by several candles burning
  in iron-barred niches. Opposite him was a heavy gate of iron bars through
  which he could see another lighted apartment in which a man, his chin sagging
  dejectedly upon his breast, was seated upon a low bench. At the sound of
  Tarzan's precipitate entrance into the adjoining chamber the man looked up
  and at sight of Zuanthrol, leaped to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Quick! To your left!" he cried, and Tarzan, turning, saw two huge,
  green-eyed beasts crouching to spring.</p>

  <p>His first impulse was to rub his eyes as one might to erase the phantom
  figures of a disquieting dream, for what he saw were two ordinary African
  wildcats&mdash;ordinary in contour and markings, but in size gigantic. For an
  instant the ape-man forgot that he was but one-fourth his normal size, and
  that the cats, that appeared to him as large as full-grown lions, were in
  reality but average specimens of their kind.</p>

  <p>As they came toward him he whipped out his sword, prepared to battle for
  his life with these great felines as he had so often before with their mighty
  cousins of his own jungle.</p>

  <p>"If you can hold them off until you reach this gate," cried the man in the
  next chamber, "I can let you through. The bolt is upon this side," but even
  as he spoke one of the cats charged.</p>

  <p><br>
  KOMODOFLORENSAL, brushing past Janzara, leaped for the spot upon the floor at
  which Tarzan had disappeared and as it gave beneath him he heard a savage cry
  break from the lips of the Princess of Veltopismakus.</p>

  <p>"So it is you he loves?" she screamed. "But he shall not have
  you&mdash;no! not even in death!" and that was all that Komodoflorensal heard
  as the black chute swallowed him.</p>

  <p>Talaskar, confronted by the infuriated Janzara, halted, and then stepped
  back, for the princess was rushing upon her with drawn dagger.</p>

  <p>"Die, slave!" she screamed, as she lunged for the white breast of
  Talaskar, but the slave girl caught the other's wrist and a moment later they
  went down, locked in one another's embrace. Together they rolled about the
  floor, the daughter of Elkomoelhago seeking to drive her slim blade into the
  breast of the slave girl, while Talaskar fought to hold off the menacing
  steel and to close with her fingers upon the throat of her antagonist.</p>

  <p><br>
  AS the first cat charged the other followed, not to be robbed of its share of
  the flesh of the kill, for both were half-starved and ravenous, and as the
  ape-man met the charge of the first, sidestepping its rush and springing in
  again to thrust at its side, Komodoflorensal, who had drawn his sword as he
  entered the apartment of Janzara, shot into the subterranean den almost into
  the teeth of the second beast, which was so disconcerted by the sudden
  appearance of this second human that it wheeled and sprang to the far end of
  the den before it could gather its courage for another attack.</p>

  <p><br>
  IN the chamber above, Talaskar and Janzara fought savagely, two she-tigers in
  human form. They rolled to and fro about the room, straining and striking,
  Janzara screaming: "Die, slave! You shall not have him!" But Talaskar held
  her peace and saved her breath, so that slowly she was overcoming the other
  when they chanced to roll upon the very spot that had let Tarzan and
  Komodoflorensal to the pit beneath.</p>

  <p>As Janzara realized what had happened she uttered a scream of terror. "The
  cats! The cats!" she cried, and then the two disappeared into the black
  shaft.</p>

  <p><br>
  KOMODOFLORENSAL did not follow the cat that had retreated to the far end of
  the pit, but sprang at once to Tarzan's aid, and together they drove off the
  first beast as they backed toward the gate where the man in the adjoining
  chamber stood ready to admit them to the safety of his own apartment.</p>

  <p>The two cats charged and then retreated, springing in quickly and away
  again as quickly, for they had learned the taste of the sharp steel with
  which the humans were defending themselves. The two men were almost at the
  gate, another instant and they could spring through. The cats charged again
  and again were driven to the far corner of the pit. The man in the next
  chamber swung open the gate.</p>

  <p>"Quick!" he cried, and at the same instant two figures shot from the mouth
  of the shaft and, locked tightly in one another's embrace, rolled to the
  floor of the pit directly in the path of the charging carnivores.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS Tarzan and Komodoflorensal realized that Talaskar and
  Janzara lay exposed to the savage assault of the hungry beasts they both
  sprang quickly toward the two girls. As had been the case when
  Komodoflorensal had shot into the pit, the cats were startled by the sudden
  appearance of these two new humans, and in the first instant of their
  surprise had leaped again to the far end of the chamber.</p>

  <p>Janzara had lost her dagger as the two girls had fallen into the shaft and
  now Talaskar saw it lying on the floor beside her. Releasing her hold upon
  the princess she seized the weapon and leaped to her feet. Already Tarzan and
  Komodoflorensal were at her side and the cats were returning to the
  attack.</p>

  <p>Janzara arose slowly and half-bewildered. She looked about, terror
  disfiguring her marvelous beauty, and as she did so the man in the adjoining
  chamber saw her.</p>

  <p>"Janzara!" he cried. "My Princess, I come!" and seizing the bench upon
  which he had been sitting, and the only thing within the chamber that might
  be converted into a weapon, he swung wide the gate and leaped into the
  chamber where the four were now facing the thoroughly infuriated beasts.</p>

  <p>Both animals, bleeding from many wounds, were mad with pain, rage and
  hunger. Screaming and growling they threw themselves upon the swords of the
  two men, who had pushed the girls behind them and were backing slowly toward
  the gate, and then the man with the bench joined Tarzan and Komodoflorensal
  and the three fought back the charges of the infuriated carnivores.</p>

  <p>The bench proved fully as good a weapon of defense as the swords and so
  together the five drew slowly back, until, quite suddenly and without the
  slightest warning both cats leaped quickly to one side and darted behind the
  party as though sensing that the women would prove easier prey. One of them
  came near to closing upon Janzara had not the man with the bench, imbued
  apparently with demoniacal fury, leaped upon it with his strange weapon and
  beaten it back so desperately that it was forced to abandon the princess.</p>

  <p>Even then the man did not cease to follow it but, brandishing the bench,
  pursued it and its fellow with such terrifying cries and prodigious blows
  that, to escape him, both cats suddenly dodged into the chamber that the man
  had occupied, and before they could return to the attack he with the bench
  had slammed the gate and fastened them upon its opposite side. Then he
  wheeled and faced the four.</p>

  <p>"Zoanthrohago!" cried the princess.</p>

  <p>"Your slave!" replied the noble, dropping to one knee and leaning far
  back, with outstretched arms.</p>

  <p>"You have saved my life, Zoanthrohago," said Janzara, "and after all the
  indignities that I have heaped upon you! How can I reward you?"</p>

  <p>"I love you, Princess, as you have long known," replied the man; "but now
  it is too late, for tomorrow I die by the king's will. Elkomoelhago has
  spoken, and, even though you be his daughter, I do not hesitate to say his
  very ignorance prevents him ever changing a decision once reached."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Janzara. "He is my sire but I love him not. He killed my
  mother in a fit of unreasoning jealousy. He is a fool&mdash;the fool of
  fools."</p>

  <p>Suddenly she turned upon the others. "These slaves would escape,
  Zoanthrohago," she cried. "With my aid they might accomplish it. With their
  company we might succeed in escaping, too, and in finding an asylum in their
  own land."</p>

  <p>"If any one of them is of sufficient power in his native city," replied
  Zoanthrohago.</p>

  <p>"This one," said Tarzan, seeing a miraculous opportunity for freedom, "is
  the son of Adendrohahkis, King of Trohanadalmakus&mdash;the eldest son, and
  Zertolosto."</p>

  <p>Janzara looked at Tarzan a moment after he had done speaking. "I was
  wicked, Zuanthrol," she said, "but I thought that I wanted you and being the
  daughter of a king I have seldom been denied aught that I craved," and then
  to Talaskar: "Take your man, my girl, and may you be happy with him," and she
  pushed Talaskar gently toward the ape-man, but Talaskar drew back.</p>

  <p>"You are mistaken, Janzara," she said, "I do not love Zuanthrol, nor does
  he love me."</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal looked quickly at Tarzan as though expecting that he would
  quickly deny the truth of Talaskar's statement, but the ape-man only nodded
  his head in assent.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean," demanded Komodoflorensal, "that you do not love Talaskar?"
  and he looked straight into the eyes of his friend.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, I love her very much," replied Tarzan; "but not in the
  way that you have believed, or should I say feared? I love her because she is
  a good girl and a kind girl and a loyal friend, and also because she was in
  trouble and needed the love and protection which you and I alone could give
  her; but as a man loves his mate, I do not love her, for I have a mate of my
  own in my country beyond the thorns."</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal said no more, but he thought a great deal. He thought of
  what it would mean to return to his own city where he was the Zertolosto, and
  where, by all the customs of ages, he would be supposed to marry a princess
  from another city. But he did not want a princess&mdash;he wanted Talaskar,
  the little slave girl of Veltopismakus, who scarcely knew her own mother and
  most probably had never heard that of her father, if her mother knew it.</p>

  <p>He wanted Talaskar, but he could only have her in Trohanadalmakus as a
  slave. His love for her was real and so he would not insult her by thinking
  such a thing as that. If he could not make her his princess he would not have
  her at all, and so Komodoflorensal, the son of Adendrohahkis, was sad.</p>

  <p>But he had none too much time to dwell upon his sorrow now, for the others
  were planning the best means for escape.</p>

  <p>"The keepers come down to feed the cats upon this side," said
  Zoanthrohago, indicating a small door in the wall of the pit opposite that
  which led into the chamber in which he had been incarcerated.</p>

  <p>"Doubtless it is not locked, either," said Janzara, "for a prisoner could
  not reach it without crossing through this chamber where the cats were
  kept."</p>

  <p>"We will see," said Tarzan, and crossed to the door.</p>

  <p>A moment sufficed to force it open, revealing a narrow corridor beyond.
  One after another the five crawled through the small aperture and following
  the corridor ascended an acclivity, lighting their way with candles taken
  from the den of the carnivores. At the top a door opened into a wide
  corridor, a short distance down which stood a warrior, evidently on guard
  before a door.</p>

  <p>Janzara looked through the tiny crack that Tarzan had opened the door and
  saw the corridor and the man. "Good!" she exclaimed. "It is my own corridor
  and the warrior is on guard before my door. I know him well. Through me he
  has escaped payment of his taxes for the past thirty moons. He would die for
  me. Come! We have nothing to fear," and stepping boldly into the corridor she
  approached the sentry, the others following behind her.</p>

  <p>Until he recognized her there was danger that the fellow would raise an
  alarm, but the moment he saw who it was he was as wax in her hands.</p>

  <p>"You are blind," she told him.</p>

  <p>"If the Princess Janzara wishes it," he replied.</p>

  <p>She told him what she wished&mdash;five diadets and some heavy warriors'
  wraps. He eyed those who were with her, and evidently recognized Zoanthrohago
  and guessed who the two other men were.</p>

  <p>"Not only shall I be blind for my princess," he said, "but tomorrow I
  shall be dead for her."</p>

  <p>"Fetch six diadets, then," said the princess.</p>

  <p>Then she turned to Komodoflorensal "You are Prince Royal of
  Trohanadalmakus?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am," he replied.</p>

  <p>"And if we show you the way to liberty you will not enslave us?"</p>

  <p>"I shall take you to the city as my own slaves and then liberate you," he
  replied.</p>

  <p>"It is something that has seldom if ever been done," she mused; "not in
  the memory of living man in Veltopismakus. I wonder if your sire will permit
  it."</p>

  <p>"The thing is not without precedent," replied Komodoflorensal "It has been
  done but rarely, yet it has been done. I think you may feel assured of a
  friendly welcome at the court of Adendrohahkis, where the wisdom of
  Zoanthrohago will not go unappreciated or unrewarded."</p>

  <p>It was a long time before the warrior returned with the diadets. His face
  was covered with perspiration and his hands with blood.</p>

  <p>"I had to fight for them," he said, "and we shall have to fight to use
  them if we do not hurry. Here, Prince, I brought you weapons," and he handed
  a sword and dagger to Zoanthrohago.</p>

  <p>They mounted quickly. It was Tarzan's first experience upon one of the
  wiry, active, little mounts of the Minunians; but he found the saddle well
  designed and the diadet easily controlled.</p>

  <p>"They will be following me from the King's Corridor," explained Oratharc,
  the warrior who had fetched the diadets. "It would be best, then, to leave by
  one of the others."</p>

  <p>"Trohanadalmakus is east of Veltopismakus," said Zoanthrohago, "and if we
  leave by the Women's Corridor with two slaves from Trohanadalmakus they will
  assume that we are going there; but if we leave by another corridor they will
  not be sure and if they lose even a little time in starting the pursuit it
  will give us just that much of an advantage. If we go straight toward
  Trohanadalmakus we shall almost certainly be overtaken as the swiftest of
  diadets will be used in our pursuit. Our only hope lies in deceiving them as
  to our route or destination, and to accomplish this I believe that we should
  leave either by the Warriors' Corridor or the Slaves' Corridor, cross the
  hills north of the city, circle far out to the north and east, not turning
  south until we are well past Trohanadalmakus. In this way we can approach
  that city from the east while our pursuers are patrolling the country west of
  Trohanadalmakus to Veltopismakus."</p>

  <p>"Let us leave by the Warriors' Corridor then," suggested Janzara.</p>

  <p>"The trees and shrubbery will conceal us while we pass around to the north
  of the city," said Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"We should leave at once," urged Oratharc.</p>

  <p>"Go first then, with the princess," said Zoanthrohago, "for there is a
  possibility that the guard at the entrance will let her pass with her party.
  We will muffle ourselves well with our warriors' cloaks. Come, lead the
  way!"</p>

  <p>With Janzara and Oratharc ahead and the others following closely they
  moved at a steady trot along the circular corridor toward the Warriors'
  Corridor, and it was not until they had turned into the latter that any sign
  of pursuit developed. Even then, though they heard the voices of men behind
  them, they hesitated to break into a faster gait lest they arouse the
  suspicions of the warriors in the guard room which they must pass near the
  mouth of the corridor.</p>

  <p>Never had the Warriors' Corridor seemed so long to any of the
  Veltopismakusians in the party as it did this night; never had they so wished
  to race their diadets as now; but they held their mounts to an even pace that
  would never have suggested to the most suspicious that here were six people
  seeking escape, most of them from death.</p>

  <p>They had come almost to the exit when they were aware that the pursuit had
  turned into the Warriors' Corridor behind them and that their pursuers were
  advancing at a rapid gait.</p>

  <p>Janzara and Oratharc drew up beside the sentry at the mouth of the
  corridor as he stepped out to bar their progress.</p>

  <p>"The Princess Janzara!" announced Oratharc. "Aside for the Princess
  Janzara!"</p>

  <p>The princess threw back the hood of the warrior's cloak she wore,
  revealing her features, well known to every warrior in the Royal
  Dome&mdash;and well feared. The fellow hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Aside, man!" cried the princess, "or I ride you down."</p>

  <p>A great shout arose behind them. Warriors on swiftly galloping diadets
  leaped along the corridor toward them. The warriors were shouting something,
  the sense of which was hidden by the noise; but the sentry was
  suspicious.</p>

  <p>"Wait until I call the Novand of the guard, Princess," he cried.
  "Something is amiss and I dare let no one pass without authority; but wait!
  Here he is," and the party turned in their saddles to see a Novand emerging
  from the door of the guard room, followed by a number of warriors.</p>

  <p>"Ride!" cried Janzara and spurred her diadet straight for the single
  sentry in their path.</p>

  <p>The others lifted their mounts quickly in pursuit. The sentry went down,
  striking valiantly with his rapier at the legs and bellies of flying diadets.
  The Novand and his men rushed from the guard room just in time to collide
  with the pursuers, whom they immediately assumed were belated members of the
  fleeing party. The brief minutes that these fought, before explanations could
  be made and understood, gave the fugitives time to pass among the trees to
  the west side of the city, and, turning north, make for the hills that were
  dimly visible in the light of a clear, but moonless night.</p><a id="pic29"

    <p class="caption">The sentry went down, striking valiantly with his
    rapier.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Oratharc, who said that he knew the hill trails perfectly, led the way,
  the others following as closely as they could; Komodoflorensal and Tarzan
  bringing up the rear. Thus they moved on in silence through the night,
  winding along precipitous mountain trails, leaping now and again from rock to
  rock where the trail itself had been able to find no footing; sliding into
  dank ravines, clambering through heavy brush and timber along tunnel-like
  trails that followed their windings, or crept up their opposite sides to
  narrow ridge or broad plateau; and all night long no sign of pursuit
  developed.</p>

  <p>Came the morning at last and with it, from the summit of a lofty ridge, a
  panorama of broad plain stretching to the north, of distant hills, of forests
  and of streams. They decided then to descend to one of the numerous park-like
  glades that they could see nestling in the hills below them, and there rest
  their mounts and permit them to feed, for the work of the night had been hard
  upon them.</p>

  <p>They knew that in the hills they might hide almost indefinitely, so wild
  and so little traveled were they and so they went into camp an hour after
  sunrise in a tiny cuplike valley surrounded by great trees, and watered and
  fed their mounts with a sense of security greater than they had felt since
  they left Veltopismakus.</p>

  <p>Oratharc went out on foot and killed a number of quail and Tarzan speared
  a couple of fish in the stream. These they prepared and ate, and then, the
  men taking turns on guard, they slept until afternoon, for none had had sleep
  the night before.</p>

  <p>Taking up their flight again in mid-afternoon they were well out upon the
  plain when darkness overtook them. Komodoflorensal and Zoanthrohago were
  riding far out upon the flanks and all were searching for a suitable camping
  place. It was Zoanthrohago who found it and they all gathered about him.
  Tarzan saw nothing in the waning light of day that appeared any more like a
  good camping place than any other spot on the open plain. There was a little
  clump of trees, but they had passed many such clumps, and there was nothing
  about this one that seemed to offer any greater security than another. As a
  matter of fact, to Tarzan it appeared anything but a desirable camp-site.
  There was no water, there was little shelter from the wind and none from an
  enemy, but perhaps they were going into the trees. That would be better. He
  looked up at the lofty branches lovingly. How enormous these trees seemed! He
  knew them for what they were and that they were trees of but average size,
  yet to him now they reared their heads aloft like veritable giants.</p>

  <p>"I will go in first," he heard Komodoflorensal say, and turned to learn
  what he referred to.</p>

  <p>The other three men were standing at the mouth of a large hole, into which
  they were looking. Tarzan knew that the opening was the mouth of the burrow
  of a ratel, the African member of the badger family, and he wondered why any
  of them wished to enter it. Tarzan had never cared for the flesh of the
  ratel. He stepped over and joined the others, and as he did so he saw
  Komodoflorensal crawl into the opening, his drawn sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Why is he doing that?" he asked Zoanthrohago.</p>

  <p>"To drive out, or kill the cambon, if he is there," replied the prince,
  giving the ratel its Minunian name.</p>

  <p>"And why?" asked Tarzan. "Surely, you do not eat its flesh!"</p>

  <p>"No, but we want his home for the night," replied Zoanthrohago. "I had
  forgotten that you are not a Minunian. We will spend the night in the
  underground chambers of the cambon, safe from the attacks of the cat or the
  lion. It would be better were we there now&mdash;this is a bad hour of the
  night for Minunians to be abroad on the plain or in the forest, for it is at
  this hour that the lion hunts."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later Komodoflorensal emerged from the hole. "The cambon is
  not there," he said. "The burrow is deserted. I found only a snake, which I
  killed. Go in, Oratharc, and Janzara and Talaskar will follow you. You have
  candles?"</p>

  <p>They had, and one by one they disappeared into the mouth of the hole,
  until Tarzan, who had asked to remain until last, stood alone in the
  gathering night gazing at the mouth of the ratel's burrow, a smile upon his
  lips. It seemed ridiculous to him that Tarzan of the Apes should ever be
  contemplating hiding from Numa in the hole of a ratel, or, worse still,
  hiding from little Skree, the wildcat, and as he stood there smiling a bulk
  loomed dimly among the trees; the diadets, standing near it tethered, snorted
  and leaped away; and Tarzan wheeled to face the largest lion he ever had
  seen&mdash;a lion that towered over twice the ape-man's height above him.</p>

  <p>How tremendous, how awe-inspiring Numa appeared to one the size of a
  Minunian!</p>

  <p>The lion crouched, its tail extended, the tip moving ever so gently; but
  the ape-man was not deceived. He guessed what was coming and even as the
  great cat sprang he turned and dove head-foremost down the hole of the ratel
  and behind him rattled the loose earth pushed into the burrow's mouth by Numa
  as he alighted upon the spot where Tarzan had stood.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR three days the six traveled toward the east, and then,
  upon the fourth, they turned south. A great forest loomed upon the distant
  southern horizon, sweeping also wide upon the east. To the southwest lay
  Trohanadalmakus, a good two-days' journey for their tired diadets. Tarzan
  often wondered what rest the little creatures obtained. At night they were
  turned loose to graze; but his knowledge of the habits of the carnivores
  assured him that the tiny antelope must spend the greater part of each night
  in terrified watching or in flight; yet every morning they were back at the
  camp awaiting the pleasure of their masters. That they did not escape, never
  to return, is doubtless due to two facts. One is that they have been for ages
  bred in the domes of the Minunians&mdash;they know no other life than with
  their masters, to whom they look for food and care&mdash;and the other is the
  extreme kindness and affection which the Minunians accord their beautiful
  beasts of burden, and which have won the love and confidence of the little
  animals to such an extent that the diadet is most contented when in the
  company of man.</p>

  <p>It was during the afternoon of the fourth day of their flight that
  Talaskar suddenly called their attention to a small cloud of dust far to
  their rear. For a long time all six watched it intently as it increased in
  size and drew nearer.</p>

  <p>"It may be the long-awaited pursuit," said Zoanthrohago.</p>

  <p>"Or some of my own people from Trohanadalmakus," suggested
  Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"Whoever they are, they greatly outnumber us," said Janzara, "and I think
  we should find shelter until we know their identity."</p>

  <p>"We can reach the forest before they overtake us," said Oratharc, "and in
  the forest we may elude them if it is necessary."</p>

  <p>"I fear the forest," said Janzara.</p>

  <p>"We have no alternative," said Zoanthrohago; "but even now I doubt that we
  can reach it ahead of them. Come! We must be quick!"</p>

  <p>Never before had Tarzan of the Apes covered ground so rapidly upon the
  back of an animal. The diadets flew through the air in great bounds. Behind
  them the nucleus of the dust cloud had resolved itself into a dozen mounted
  warriors, against whom their four blades would be helpless. Their one hope,
  therefore, lay in reaching the forest ahead of their pursuers, and now it
  seemed that they would be successful and now it seemed that they would
  not.</p>

  <p>The recently distant wood seemed rushing toward him as Tarzan watched
  ahead between the tiny horns of his graceful mount, and, behind, the enemy
  was gaining. They were Veltopismakusian&mdash;they were close enough now for
  the devices upon their helmets to be seen&mdash;and they had recognized their
  quarry, for they cried aloud upon them to stop, calling several of them by
  name.</p>

  <p>One of the pursuers forged farther ahead than the others. He came now
  close behind Zoanthrohago, who rode neck and neck with Tarzan, in the rear of
  their party. A half-length ahead of Zoanthrohago, was Janzara. The fellow
  called aloud to her.</p>

  <p>"Princess!" he cried. "The king's pardon for you all if you return the
  slaves to us. Surrender and all will be forgiven."</p>

  <p>Tarzan of the Apes heard and he wondered what the Veltopismakusians would
  do. It must have been a great temptation and he knew it. Had it not been for
  Talaskar he would have advised them to fall back among their friends, but he
  would not see the slave girl sacrificed. He drew his sword then and dropped
  back beside Zoanthrohago, though the other never guessed his purpose.</p>

  <p>"Surrender, and all will be forgiven!" shouted the pursuer again.</p>

  <p>"Never!" cried Zoanthrohago.</p>

  <p>"Never!" echoed Janzara.</p>

  <p>"The consequences are yours," cried the messenger, and on they rushed,
  pursuers and pursued, toward the dark forest, while from just within its rim
  savage eyes watched the mad race and red tongues licked hungry lips in
  anticipation.</p>

  <p>Tarzan had been glad to hear the reply given by both Zoanthrohago and
  Janzara whom he had found likable companions and good comrades. Janzara's
  whole attitude had changed since the very instant she had joined them in
  their attempted escape. No longer was she the spoiled daughter of a despot;
  but a woman seeking happiness through the new love that she had found, or the
  old love that she had just discovered, for she often told Zoanthrohago that
  she knew now that she always had loved him. And this new thing in her life
  made her more considerate and loving of others. She seemed now to be trying
  to make up to Talaskar for the cruelty of her attack upon her when she had
  first seen her. Her mad infatuation for Tarzan she now knew in its true
  light&mdash;because she had been refused him she wanted him, and she would
  have taken him as her prince to spite her father, whom she hated.</p>

  <p>Komodoflorensal and Talaskar always rode together, but no words of love
  did the Trohanadalmakusian speak in the ear of the little slave girl. A great
  resolve was crystallizing in his mind, but it had as yet taken on no definite
  form. And Talaskar, seemingly happy just to be near him, rode blissfully
  through the first days of the only freedom she had ever known; but now all
  was forgotten except the instant danger of capture and its alternative
  concomitants, death and slavery.</p>

  <p>The six urged their straining mounts ahead. The forest was so near now.
  Ah, if they could but reach it! There one warrior might be as good as three
  and the odds against them would be reduced, for in the forest the whole
  twelve could not engage them at once and by careful maneuvering they
  doubtless could separate them.</p>

  <p>They were going to succeed! A great shout rose to the lips of Oratharc as
  his diadet leaped into the shadows of the first trees, and the others took it
  up, for a brief instant, and then it died upon their lips as they saw a giant
  hand reach down and snatch Oratharc from his saddle. They tried to stop and
  wheel their mounts, but it was too late. Already they were in the forest and
  all about them was a horde of the hideous Zertalacolols. One by one they were
  snatched from their diadets, while their pursuers, who must have seen what
  was taking place just inside the forest, wheeled and galloped away.</p>

  <p>Talaskar, writhing in the grip of a she Alali, turned toward
  Komodoflorensal.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye!" she cried. "This, at last, is the end; but I can die near you
  and so I am happier dying than I have been living until you came to
  Veltopismakus."</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Talaskar!" he replied. "Living, I dared not tell you; but
  dying, I can proclaim my love. Tell me that you loved me."</p>

  <p>"With all my heart, Komodoflorensal!" They seemed to have forgotten that
  another existed but themselves. In death they were alone with their love.</p>

  <p>Tarzan found himself in the hand of a male and he also found himself
  wondering, even as he faced certain death, how it occurred that this great
  band of male and female Alali should be hunting together, and then he noticed
  the weapons of the male. They were not the crude bludgeon and the
  slinging-stones that they had formerly carried, but long, trim spears, and
  bows and arrows.</p>

  <p>And now the creature that held him had lifted him even with his face and
  was scrutinizing him and Tarzan saw a look of recognition and amazement cross
  the bestial features, and he, in turn, recognized his captor. It was the son
  of The First Woman. Tarzan did not wait to learn the temper of his old
  acquaintance. Possibly their relations were altered now. Possibly they were
  not. He recalled the doglike devotion of the creature when last he had seen
  him and he put him to the test at once.</p>

  <p>"Put me down!" he signed, peremptorily; "and tell your people to put down
  all of my people. Harm them not!"</p>

  <p>Instantly the great creature set Tarzan gently upon the ground and
  immediately signaled his fellows to do the same with their captives. The men
  did immediately as they were bid, and all of the women but one. She
  hesitated. The son of The First Woman leaped toward her, his spear raised
  like a whip, and the female cowered and set Talaskar down upon the
  ground.</p>

  <p>Very proud, the son of the First Woman explained to Tarzan as best he
  could the great change that had come upon the Alali since the ape-man had
  given the men weapons and the son of The First Woman had discovered what a
  proper use of them would mean to the males of his kind. Now each male had a
  woman cooking for him&mdash;at least one, and some of them&mdash;the
  stronger&mdash;had more than one.</p>

  <p>To entertain Tarzan and to show him what great strides civilization had
  taken in the land of the Zertalacolols, the son of The First Woman seized a
  female by the hair and dragging her to him struck her heavily about the head
  and face with his clenched fist, and the woman fell upon her knees and
  fondled his legs, looking wistfully into his face, her own glowing with love
  and admiration.</p>

  <p>That night the six slept in the open surrounded by the great Zertalacolols
  and the next day they started across the plain toward Trohanadalmakus where
  Tarzan had resolved to remain until he regained his normal size, when he
  would make a determined effort to cut his way through the thorn forest to his
  own country.</p>

  <p>The Zertalacolols went a short distance out into the plain with them, and
  both men and women tried in their crude, savage way, to show Tarzan their
  gratitude for the change that he had wrought among them, and the new
  happiness he had given them.</p>

  <p>Two days later the six fugitives approached the domes of Trohanadalmakus.
  They had been seen by sentries when they were still a long way off, and a
  body of warriors rode forth to meet them, for it is always well to learn the
  nature of a visitor's business in Minuni before he gets too close to your
  home.</p>

  <p>When the warriors discovered that Komodoflorensal and Tarzan had returned
  they shouted for joy and a number of them galloped swiftly back to the city
  to spread the news.</p>

  <p>The fugitives were conducted at once to the throne room of Adendrohahkis
  and there that great ruler took his son in his arms and wept, so great was
  his happiness at having him returned safely to him. Nor did he forget Tarzan,
  though it was some time before he or the other Trohanadalmakusians could
  accustom themselves to the fact that this man, no bigger than they, was the
  great giant who had dwelt among them a few moons since.</p>

  <p>Adendrohahkis called Tarzan to the foot of the throne and there, before
  the nobles and warriors of Trohanadalmakus, he made him a Zertol, or prince,
  and he gave him diadets and riches and allotted him quarters fitted to his
  rank, begging him to stay among them always.</p>

  <p>Janzara, Zoanthrohago and Oratharc he gave their liberty and permission to
  remain in Trohanadalmakus, and then Komodoflorensal drew Talaskar to the foot
  of the throne.</p>

  <p>"And now for myself I ask a boon, Adendrohahkis," he said. "As Zertolosto
  I am bound by custom to wed a prisoner princess taken from another city; but
  in this slave girl have I found the one I love. Let me renounce my rights to
  the throne and have her instead."</p>

  <p>Talaskar raised her hand as though to demur, but Komodoflorensal would not
  let her speak, and then Adendrohahkis rose and descended the steps at the
  foot of which Talaskar stood and taking her by the hand led her to a place
  beside the throne.</p>

  <p>"You are bound by custom only, Komodoflorensal," he said, "to wed a
  princess, but custom is not law. A Trohanadalmakusian may wed whom he
  pleases."</p>

  <p>"And even though he were bound by law," said Talaskar, "to wed a princess,
  still might he wed me, for I am the daughter of Talaskhago, king of
  Mandalamakus. My mother was captured by the Veltopismakusians but a few moons
  before my birth, which took place in the very chamber in which
  Komodoflorensal found me. She taught me to take my life before mating with
  anyone less than a prince; but I would have forgotten her teachings had
  Komodoflorensal been but the son of a slave. That he was the son of a king I
  did not dream until the night we left Veltopismakus, and I had already given
  him my heart long before, though he did not know it."</p>

  <p>Weeks passed and still no change came to Tarzan of the Apes. He was happy
  in his life with the Minunians, but he longed for his own people and the mate
  who would be grieving for him, and so he determined to set forth as he was,
  pass through the thorn forest and make his way toward home, trusting to
  chance that he might escape the countless dangers that would infest his way,
  and perhaps come to his normal size somewhere during the long journey.</p>

  <p>His friends sought to dissuade him, but he was determined, and at last,
  brooking no further delay, he set out toward the southeast in the direction
  that he thought lay the point where he had entered the land of the Minuni. A
  kamak, a body consisting of one thousand mounted warriors, accompanied him to
  the great forest and there, after some days' delay, the son of The First
  Woman found him. The Minunians bade him good-bye, and as he watched them ride
  away upon their graceful mounts, something rose in his throat that only came
  upon those few occasions in his life that Tarzan of the Apes knew the meaning
  of homesickness.</p>

  <p>The son of The First Woman and his savage band escorted Tarzan to the edge
  of the thorn forest. Further than that they could not go. A moment later they
  saw him disappear among the thorns, with a wave of farewell to them. For two
  days Tarzan, no larger than a Minunian, made his way through the thorn
  forest. He met small animals that were now large enough to be dangerous to
  him, but he met nothing that he could not cope with. By night he slept in the
  burrows of the larger burrowing animals. Birds and eggs formed his food
  supply.</p>

  <p>During the second night he awoke with a feeling of nausea suffusing him. A
  premonition of danger assailed him. It was dark as the grave in the burrow he
  had selected for the night. Suddenly the thought smote him that he might be
  about to pass through the ordeal of regaining his normal stature. To have
  this thing happen while he lay buried in this tiny burrow would mean death,
  for he would be crushed, strangled, or suffocated before he regained
  consciousness.</p>

  <p>Already he felt dizzy, as one might feel who was upon the verge of
  unconsciousness. He stumbled to his knees and clawed his way up the steep
  acclivity that led to the surface. Would he reach it in time? He stumbled on
  and then, suddenly, a burst of fresh night air smote his nostrils. He
  staggered to his feet. He was out! He was free!</p>

  <p>Behind him he heard a low growl. Grasping his sword, he lunged forward
  among the thorn trees. How far he went, or in what direction he did not know.
  It was still dark when he stumbled and fell unconscious to the ground.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">USULA, returning from the village of Obebe the cannibal, saw
  a bone lying beside the trail. This, in itself, was nothing remarkable. Many
  bones lie along savage trails in Africa. But this bone caused him to pause.
  It was the bone of a child. Nor was that alone enough to give pause to a
  warrior hastening through an unfriendly country back toward his own
  people.</p>

  <p>But Usula had heard strange tales in the village of Obebe the cannibal
  where rumor had brought him in search of his beloved master, The Big Bwana.
  Obebe had not seen nor heard anything of Tarzan of the Apes. Not for years
  had he seen the giant white. He assured Usula of this fact many times; but
  from other members of the tribe the Waziri learned that a white man had been
  kept a prisoner by Obebe for a year or more and that some time since he had
  escaped. At first Usula thought this white man might have been Tarzan but
  when he verified the statement of the time that had elapsed since the man was
  captured he knew that it could not have been his master, and so he turned
  back along the trail toward home; but when he saw the child's bone along the
  trail several days out he recalled the story of the missing Uhha and he
  paused, just for a moment, to look at the bone. And as he looked he saw
  something else&mdash;a small skin bag, lying among some more bones a few feet
  off the trail. Usula stooped and picked up the bag. He opened it and poured
  some of the contents into his palm. He knew what the things were and he knew
  that they had belonged to his master, for Usula was a headman who knew much
  about his master's affairs. These were the diamonds that had been stolen from
  The Big Bwana many moons before by the white men who had found Opar. He would
  take them back to The Big Bwana's lady.</p>

  <p>Three days later as he moved silently along the trail close to The Great
  Thorn Forest he came suddenly to a halt, the hand grasping his heavy spear
  tensing in readiness. In a little open place he saw a man, an almost naked
  man, lying upon the ground. The man was alive&mdash;he saw him move&mdash;but
  what was he doing? Usula crept closer, making no noise. He moved around until
  he could observe the man from another angle and then he saw a horrid sight.
  The man was white and he lay beside the carcass of a long-dead buffalo,
  greedily devouring the remnants of hide that clung to the bleaching
  bones.</p>

  <p>The man raised his head a little and Usula, catching a better view of his
  face, gave a cry of horror. Then the man looked up and grinned. It was The
  Big Bwana!</p>

  <p>Usula ran to him and raised him upon his knees, but the man only laughed
  and babbled like a child. At his side, caught over one of the horns of the
  buffalo, was The Big Bwana's golden locket with the great diamonds set in it.
  Usula replaced it about the man's neck. He built a strong shelter for him
  nearby and hunted food, and for many days he remained until the man's
  strength came back, but his mind did not come back. And thus, in this
  condition, the faithful Usula led home his master.</p>

  <p>They found many wounds and bruises upon his body and his head, some old,
  some new, some trivial, some serious; and they sent to England for a great
  surgeon to come out to Africa and seek to mend the poor thing that once had
  been Tarzan of the Apes.</p>

  <p>The dogs that had once loved Lord Greystoke slunk from this brainless
  creature. Jad-bal-ja, the Golden Lion, growled when the man was wheeled near
  his cage.</p>

  <p>Korak The Killer paced the floor in dumb despair, for his mother was on
  her way from England, and what would be the effect upon her of this awful
  blow? He hesitated even to contemplate it.</p>

  <p><br>
  KHAMIS, the witch doctor, had searched untiringly for Uhha, his daughter,
  since The River Devil had stolen her from the village of Obebe the cannibal.
  He had made pilgrimages to other villages, some of them remote from his own
  country, but he had found no trace of her or her abductor.</p>

  <p>He was returning from another fruitless search that had extended far to
  the east of the village of Obebe, skirting the Great Thorn Forest a few miles
  north of the Ugogo. It was early morning. He had just broken his lonely camp
  and set out upon the last leg of his homeward journey when his keen old eyes
  discovered something lying at the edge of a small open space a hundred yards
  to his right. He had just a glimpse of something that was not of the
  surrounding vegetation. He did not know what it was, but instinct bade him
  investigate. Moving cautiously nearer he presently identified the thing as a
  human knee just showing above the low grass that covered the clearing. He
  crept closer and suddenly his eyes narrowed and his breath made a single, odd
  little sound as it sucked idly between his lips in mechanical reaction to
  surprise, for what he saw was the body of The River Devil lying upon its
  back, one knee flexed&mdash;the knee that he had seen above the grasses.</p>

  <p>His spear advanced and ready he approached until he stood above the
  motionless body. Was The River Devil dead, or was he asleep? Placing the
  point of his spear against the brown breast Khamis prodded. The Devil did not
  awaken. He was not asleep, then! nor did he appear to be dead. Khamis knelt
  and placed an ear above the other's heart. He was not dead!</p>

  <p>The witch doctor thought quickly. In his heart he did not believe in River
  Devils, yet there was a chance that there might be such things and perhaps
  this one was shamming unconsciousness, or temporarily absent from the flesh
  it assumed as a disguise that it might go among men without arousing
  suspicion. But, too, it was the abductor of his daughter. That thought filled
  him with rage and with courage. He must force the truth from those lips even
  though the creature were a Devil.</p>

  <p>He unwound a bit of fiber rope from about his waist and, turning the body
  over upon its back, quickly bound the wrists behind it. Then he sat down
  beside it to wait. It was an hour before signs of returning consciousness
  appeared, then The River Devil opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Where is Uhha, my daughter?" demanded the witch doctor.</p>

  <p>The River Devil tried to free his arms, but they were too tightly bound.
  He made no reply to Khamis' question. It was as though he had not heard it.
  He ceased struggling and lay back again, resting. After a while he opened his
  eyes once more and lay looking at Khamis, but he did not speak.</p>

  <p>"Get up!" commanded the witch doctor and prodded him with a spear.</p>

  <p>The River Devil rolled over on his side, flexed his right knee, raised on
  one elbow and finally got to his feet. Khamis prodded him in the direction of
  the trail. Toward dusk they arrived at the village of Obebe.</p>

  <p>When the warriors and the women and the children saw who it was that
  Khamis was bringing to the village they became very much excited, and had it
  not been for the witch doctor, of whom they were afraid, they would have
  knifed and stoned the prisoner to death before he was fairly inside the
  village gates; but Khamis did not want The River Devil killed&mdash;not yet.
  He wanted first to force from him the truth concerning Uhha. So far he had
  been unable to get a word out of his prisoner. Incessant questioning,
  emphasized by many prods of the spear point had elicited nothing.</p>

  <p>Khamis threw his prisoner into the same hut from which The River Devil had
  escaped, but he bound him securely and placed two warriors on guard. He had
  no mind to lose him again. Obebe came to see him. He, too, questioned him;
  but The River Devil only looked blankly in the face of the chief.</p>

  <p>"I will make him speak," said Obebe. "After we have finished eating we
  will have him out and make him speak. I know many ways."</p>

  <p>"You must not kill him," said the witch doctor. "He knows what became of
  Uhha, and until he tells me no one shall kill him."</p>

  <p>"He will speak before he dies," said Obebe.</p>

  <p>"He is a River Devil and will never die," said Khamis, reverting to the
  old controversy.</p>

  <p>"He is Tarzan," cried Obebe, and the two were still arguing after they had
  passed out of hearing of the prisoner lying in the filth of the hut.</p>

  <p>After they had eaten he saw them heating irons in a fire near the hut of
  the witch doctor, who was squatting before the entrance working rapidly with
  numerous charms&mdash;bits of wood wrapped in leaves, pieces of stone, some
  pebbles, a zebra's tail.</p>

  <p>Villagers were congregating about Khamis until presently the prisoner
  could no longer see him. A little later a black boy came and spoke to his
  guards, and he was taken out and pushed roughly toward the hut of the witch
  doctor.</p>

  <p>Obebe was there, as he saw after the guards had opened a way through the
  throng and he stood beside the fire in the center of the circle. It was only
  a small fire; just enough to keep a couple of irons hot.</p>

  <p>"Where is Uhha, my daughter?" demanded Khamis.</p>

  <p>The River Devil did not answer. Not once had he spoken since Khamis had
  captured him.</p>

  <p>"Burn out one of his eyes," said Obebe. "That will make him speak!"</p>

  <p>"Cut out his tongue!" screamed a woman. "Cut out his tongue."</p>

  <p>"Then he cannot speak at all, you fool," cried Khamis.</p>

  <p>The witch doctor arose and put the question again, but received no reply.
  Then he struck The River Devil a heavy blow in the face. Khamis had lost his
  temper, so that he did not fear even a River Devil.</p>

  <p>"You will answer me now!" he screamed, and stooping he seized a red-hot
  iron.</p>

  <p>"The right eye first!" shrilled Obebe.</p>

  <p><br>
  THE doctor came to the bungalow of the ape-man&mdash;Lady Greystoke brought
  him with her. They were three tired and dusty travelers as they dismounted at
  last before the rose-embowered entrance&mdash;the famous London surgeon, Lady
  Greystoke, and Flora Hawkes, her maid. The surgeon and Lady Greystoke went
  immediately to the room where Tarzan sat in an improvised wheelchair. He
  looked up at them blankly as they entered.</p>

  <p>"Don't you know me, John?" asked the woman.</p>

  <p>Her son took her by the shoulders and led her away, weeping.</p>

  <p>"He does not know any of us," he said. "Wait until after the operation,
  mother, before you see him again. You can do him no good and to see him this
  way is too hard upon you."</p>

  <p>The great surgeon made his examination. There was pressure on the brain
  from a recent fracture of the skull. An operation would relieve the pressure
  and might restore the patient's mind and memory. It was worth attempting.</p>

  <p>Nurses and two doctors from Nairobi, engaged the day they arrived there,
  followed Lady Greystoke and the London surgeon, reaching the bungalow the day
  after their arrival. The operation took place the following morning.</p>

  <p>Lady Greystoke, Korak and Meriem were awaiting, in an adjoining room, the
  verdict of the surgeon. Was the operation a failure or a success? They sat
  mutely staring at the door leading into the improvised operating room. At
  last it opened, after what seemed ages, but was only perhaps, an hour. The
  surgeon entered the room where they sat. Their eyes, dumbly pleading, asked
  him the question that their lips dared not voice.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you anything as yet," he said, "other than that the
  operation, as an operation, was successful. What the result of it will be
  only time will tell. I have given orders that no one is to enter his room,
  other than the nurses for ten days. They are instructed not to speak to him
  or allow him to speak for the same length of time; but he will not wish to
  speak, for I shall keep him in a semiconscious condition, by means of drugs,
  until the ten days have elapsed. Until then, Lady Greystoke, we may only hope
  for the best; but I can assure you that your husband has every chance for
  complete recovery. I think you may safely hope for the best."</p>

  <p><br>
  THE witch doctor laid his left hand upon the shoulder of The River Devil; in
  his right hand was clutched a red-hot iron.</p>

  <p>"The right eye first," shrilled Obebe again.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the muscles upon the back and shoulders of the prisoner leaped
  into action, rolling beneath his brown hide. For just an instant he appeared
  to exert terrific physical force, there was a snapping sound at his back as
  the strands about his wrists parted, and an instant later steel-thewed
  fingers fell upon the right wrist of the witch doctor. Blazing eyes burned
  into his. He dropped the red-hot rod, his fingers paralyzed by the pressure
  upon his wrist, and he screamed, for he saw death in the angry face of the
  god.</p>

  <p>Obebe leaped to his feet. Warriors pressed forward, but not near enough to
  be within reach of The River Devil. They had never been certain of the safety
  of tempting Providence in any such manner as Khamis and Obebe had been about
  to do. Now here was the result! The wrath of The River Devil would fall upon
  them all. They fell back, some of them, and that was a cue for others to fall
  back. In the minds of all was the thought&mdash;if I have no hand in this The
  River Devil will not be angry with me. Then they turned and fled to their
  huts, stumbling over their women and their children who were trying to
  outdistance their lords and masters.</p>

  <p>Obebe turned now to flee also, and The River Devil picked Khamis up, and
  held him in two hands high above his head, and ran after Obebe the chief. The
  latter dodged into his own hut. He had scarce reached the center of it when
  there came a terrific crash upon the light, thatched roof, which gave way
  beneath a heavy weight. A body descending upon the chief filled him with
  terror. The River Devil had leaped in through the roof of his hut to destroy
  him! The instinct of self-preservation rose momentarily above his fear of the
  supernatural, for now he was convinced that Khamis had been right and the
  creature they had so long held prisoner was indeed The River Devil. And Obebe
  drew the knife at his side and plunged it again and again into the body of
  the creature that had leaped upon him, and when he knew that life was extinct
  he rose and dragging the body after him stepped out of his hut into the light
  of the moon and the fires.</p>

  <p>"Come, my people!" he cried. "You have nothing to fear, for I, Obebe, your
  chief, have slain The River Devil with my own hands," and then he looked down
  at the thing trailing behind him, and gave a gasp, and sat down suddenly in
  the dirt of the village street, for the body at his heels was that of Khamis,
  the witch doctor.</p>

  <p>His people came and when they saw what had happened they said nothing, but
  looked terrified. Obebe examined his hut and the ground around it. He took
  several warriors and searched the village. The stranger had departed. He went
  to the gates. They were closed; but in the dust before them was the imprint
  of naked feet&mdash;the naked feet of a white man. Then he came back to his
  hut, where his frightened people stood waiting him.</p>

  <p>"Obebe was right," he said. "The creature was not The River Devil&mdash;it
  was Tarzan of the Apes, for only he could hurl Khamis so high above his head
  that he would fall through the roof of a hut, and only he could pass unaided
  over our gates."</p>

  THE tenth day had come. The great surgeon was still at the Greystoke bungalow
  awaiting the outcome of the operation. The patient was slowly emerging from
  under the influence of the last dose of drugs that had been given him during
  the preceding night, but he was regaining his consciousness more slowly than
  the surgeon had hoped. The long hours dragged by, morning ran into afternoon,
  and evening came, and still there was no word from the sickroom.</p>

  <p>It was dark. The lamps were lighted. The family were congregated in the
  big living room. Suddenly the door opened and a nurse appeared. Behind her
  was the patient. There was a puzzled look upon his face; but the face of the
  nurse was wreathed in smiles. The surgeon came behind, assisting the man, who
  was weak from long inactivity.</p>

  <p>"I think Lord Greystoke will recover rapidly now," he said. "There are
  many things that you may have to tell him. He did not know who he was, when
  he regained consciousness, but that is not unusual in such cases."</p>

  <p>The patient took a few steps into the room, looking wonderingly about.</p>

  <p>"There is your wife, Greystoke," said the surgeon, kindly.</p>

  <p>Lady Greystoke rose and crossed the room toward her husband, her arms
  outstretched. A smile crossed the face of the invalid, as he stepped forward
  to meet her and take her in his arms, but suddenly someone was between them,
  holding them apart. It was Flora Hawkes.</p>

  <p>"My Gawd, Lady Greystoke!" she cried. "He ain't your husband. It's
  Miranda, Esteban Miranda! Don't you suppose I'd know him in a million? I
  ain't seen him since we came back, never havin' been in the sick chamber, but
  I suspicioned something the minute he stepped into this room and when he
  smiled, I knew."</p>

  <p>"Flora!" cried the distracted wife. "Are you sure? No! no! you must be
  wrong! God has not given me back my husband only to steal him away again.
  John! tell me, is it you? You would not lie to me?"</p>

  <p>For a moment the man before them was silent. He swayed to and fro, as in
  weakness. The surgeon stepped forward and supported him.</p>

  <p>"I have been very sick," he said. "Possibly I have changed, but I am Lord
  Greystoke. I do not remember this woman," and he indicated Flora Hawkes.</p>

  <p>"He lies!" cried the girl.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he lies," said a quiet voice behind them, and they all turned to see
  the figure of a giant white standing in the open French windows leading to
  the veranda.</p>

  <p>"John!" cried Lady Greystoke, running toward him, "how could I have been
  mistaken? I&mdash;" but the rest of the sentence was lost as Tarzan of the
  Apes sprang into the room and taking his mate in his arms covered her lips
  with kisses.</p><a id="pic30"
