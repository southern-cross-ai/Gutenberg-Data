  <h2><a id="chap01"
     name="chap01"></a>I. &mdash; THE EMPEROR'S PLAN</h2>

  <p class="first">THE reigning successor of the great Augustus, the master of
  some forty legions, the ruler of the Roman world, was in council. But his
  council was unlike as possible to the assembly which one might have thought
  he would have gathered together to deliberate on matters that concerned the
  happiness, it might almost be said, of mankind. Here were no veteran generals
  who had guarded the frontiers of the Empire, and seen the barbarians of the
  East and of the West recoil before the victorious eagles of Rome; no Governor
  of provinces, skilled in the arts of peace; no financiers, practised in
  increasing the amount of the revenue without aggravating the burdens that the
  tax-payers consciously felt; no philosophers to contribute their theoretical
  wisdom; no men of business to give their master the benefit of their
  practical advice. Nero had such men at his call, but he preferred, and not
  perhaps without reason, to confide his schemes to very different advisers.
  There were three persons in the Imperial Chamber; or four, if we are to
  reckon the page, a lad of singular beauty of form and feature, but a deaf
  mute, who stood by the Emperor's couch, clad in a gold-edged scarlet tunic,
  and holding an ivory-handled fan of peacock's feathers, which he waved with a
  gentle motion.</p>

  <p>Let me begin my description of the Imperial Cabinet, for such it really
  was, with a portrait of Nero himself.</p>

  <p>The Emperor showed to considerable advantage in the position which he
  happened to be occupying at the time. The chief defects of his figure, the
  corpulence which his excessive indulgence in the pleasures of the table had
  already, in spite of his youth, increased to serious proportions, and the
  unsightly thinness of his lower limbs, were not brought into prominence. His
  face, as far as beauty was concerned, was not unworthy of an Emperor, but as
  the biographer of the Cæsars says, it was "handsome rather than attractive."
  The features were regular and even beautiful in their outlines, but they
  wanted, as indeed it could not be but that they should want, the grace and
  charm in which the beauty of the man's nature shines forth. The complexion,
  originally fair, was flushed with intemperance. There were signs here and
  there of what would soon become disfiguring blotches. The large eyes that in
  childhood and boyhood had been singularly clear and limpid were now somewhat
  dull and dim. The hair was of the yellow hue that was particularly pleasing
  to an Italian eye, accustomed, for the most part, to black and the darker
  shades of brown. Nero was particularly proud of its color, so much so indeed,
  that, greatly to the disgust of more old- fashioned Romans, he wore it in
  braids. On the whole his appearance, though not without a certain comeliness
  and even dignity, was forbidding and sinister. No one that saw him could give
  him credit for any kindness of heart or even good nature. His cheeks were
  heavy, his chin square, his lips curiously thin. Not less repulsive was the
  short bull neck. At the moment of which I am writing his face wore as
  pleasing an expression as it was capable of assuming. He was in high spirits
  and full of a pleased excitement. We shall soon see the cause that had so
  exhilarated him.</p>

  <p>Next to the Emperor, by right of precedence, must naturally come the
  Empress, for it was to this rank that the adventuress Poppæa had now
  succeeded in raising herself. Her first husband had been one of the two
  commanders of the Prætorian Guard; her second, Consul and afterwards Governor
  of a great province, destined indeed himself to occupy for a few months the
  Imperial throne; her third was the heir of Augustus and Tiberius, the last of
  the Julian Cæsars. Older than the Emperor, for she had borne a child to her
  first husband more than twelve years before, she still preserved the
  freshness of early youth. Something of this, perhaps, was due to the extreme
  care which she devoted to her appearance, but more to the expression of
  innocence and modesty which some strange freak of nature&mdash;for never
  surely did a woman's look more utterly belie her disposition&mdash;had given
  to her countenance. To look at her certainly at that moment, with her golden
  hair falling in artless ringlets over a forehead smooth as a child's, her
  delicately arched lips, parted in a smile that just showed a glimpse of
  pearly teeth, her cheeks just tinged with a faint wild-rose blush, her large,
  limpid eyes, with just a touch of wonder in their depths, eyes that did not
  seem to harbour an evil thought, any one might have thought her as good as
  she was beautiful. Yet she was profligate, unscrupulous, and cruel. Her vices
  had always been calculating, and when a career had been opened to her
  ambition she let nothing stand in her way. Nero's mother had perished because
  she barred the adventuress' road to a throne, and Nero's wife soon shared the
  fate of his mother.</p>

  <p>The third member of the Council was, if it is possible to imagine it,
  worse than the other two. Nero began his reign amidst the high hopes of his
  subjects, and for a few weeks, at least, did not disappoint them, and
  Josephus speaks of Poppæa as a "pious" woman; but we hear nothing about
  Tigellinus that is not absolutely vile. Born in poverty and obscurity, he had
  made his way to the bad eminence in which we find him by the worst of arts. A
  man of mature age, for by this time he must have numbered at least fifty
  years, he used his greater experience to make the young Emperor even worse
  than his natural tendencies, and all the evil influences of despotic power,
  would have made him. And he was what Nero, to do him justice, never was,
  fiercely resentful of sarcasm and ridicule. Nero suffered the most savage
  lampoons on his character to be published with impunity, but no one satirized
  Tigellinus without suffering for his audacity.</p>

  <p>The scene of the Council was a pleasant room in the Emperor's seaside
  villa at Antium. This villa was a favourite residence with him. He had
  himself been born in it. Here he had welcomed with delight, extravagant,
  indeed, but yet not wholly beyond our sympathies, the birth of the daughter
  whom Poppæa had borne to him in the preceding year; here he had mourned,
  extravagantly again, but not without some real feeling, for the little one's
  death. It was at Antium, far from the wild excitement of Rome, that he had
  what may be called the lucid intervals in his career of frantic crime.</p>

  <p>The subject which now engaged his attention, and the attention of his
  advisers, was one that seemed of a harmless and even a laudable kind. It was
  nothing less than a magnificent plan for the rebuilding of Rome. All the ill-
  ventilated, ill-smelling passages; all the narrow, winding streets; all the
  ill- built and half-ruinous houses; all, in short, that was unsanitary,
  inconvenient, and unsightly was to be swept away; a new city with broad,
  regular streets and spacious promenades was to rise in its place. At last the
  Empire of the world would have a capital worthy of itself. The plan was
  substantially of Nero's own devising. He had had, indeed, some professional
  assistance from builders, architects, and others, in drawing out its details,
  but in its main lines, certainly in its magnificent contempt for the
  expedient, one might almost say of the possible, it came from his own brain.
  And he had managed to keep it a secret from both Poppæa and Tigellinus. To
  them it was a real surprise, and, as they both possessed competent
  intelligence, however deficient in moral sense, they were able to appreciate
  its cleverness. Their genuine admiration, which so practised an ear as Nero's
  easily distinguished from flattery, was exceedingly pleasing to the
  Emperor.</p>

  <p>"Augustus," he said, after enjoying for a time his companions' unfeigned
  surprise, "said that he found a city of brick and left a city of marble. I
  mean to be able to boast that I left a new city altogether. Indeed, I feel
  that nothing short of this is worthy of me, and I thank the gods that have
  left for me so magnificent an opportunity."</p>

  <p>"And this vacant space," asked Tigellinus, after various details had been
  explained by the Emperor: "What do you mean, Sire, to do with this?"</p>

  <p>A huge blank had been left in the middle of the map, covering nearly the
  whole of the Palatine and Esquiline Hills.</p>

  <p>"That is meant to be occupied by my palace and park," said the
  Emperor.</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister, if one may so describe him, could not restrain an
  involuntary gesture of surprise.</p>

  <p>Nero's face darkened with the scowl that never failed to show itself at
  even the slightest opposition to his will.</p>

  <p>"Think you, then," he cried in an angry tone, "that it is too large? The
  Master of Rome cannot be lodged too well."</p>

  <p>Tigellinus felt that it would be safer not to criticise any further.
  Poppæa, who, to do her justice, was never wanting in courage, now took up the
  discussion. The objection that she had to make was in keeping with a curious
  trait in her character. "Pious" she certainly was not, though Josephus saw
  fit so to describe her, but she was unquestionably superstitious. The terrors
  of an unseen world, though they did not keep her back from vice and crime,
  were still real to her. She did not stick at murder; but nothing would have
  induced her to pass by a temple without a proper reverence. This feeling
  quickened her insight into an aspect of the matter which her companion had
  failed to observe.</p>

  <p>"You will buy the houses which you will have to pull down?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," the Emperor replied; "that will be an easy matter."</p>

  <p>"But there are buildings which it will not be easy to buy."</p>

  <p>The scowl showed itself again on Nero's face.</p>

  <p>"Who will refuse to sell when I want to buy?" he cried. "And besides, you
  may be sure that I shall not stint the price."</p>

  <p>"True, Sire, but there are the temples, the chapels; they cannot be bought
  and sold as if they were private houses."</p>

  <p>Nero started up from his couch, and paced the room several times. He could
  not refuse to see the difficulty. Holy places were not to be bought and
  pulled down as if they were nothing but so many bricks and stones.</p>

  <p>"What say you, Tigellinus?" he cried after a few minutes of silence.
  "Cannot the Emperor do what he will? Cannot the priests or the augurs, or
  some one smooth the way? Speak, man!" he went on impatiently, as the minister
  did not answer at once.</p>

  <p>"The gods forbid that I should presume to limit your power!" said
  Tigellinus. "But yet&mdash;may I speak freely?"</p>

  <p>"Freely!" cried Nero; "of course. When did I ever resent the truth?"</p>

  <p>Tigellinus repressed a smile. His own rise was certainly not due to
  speaking the truth. He went on:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"One sacred building, or two, or even three, might be dealt with when some
  great improvement was in question. That has been done before, and might be
  done again, but when it comes to a matter of fifty or sixty, or even a
  hundred,&mdash;very likely there are more, for they stand very thick in the
  old city,&mdash;the affair becomes serious. I don't say it would be
  impossible, but there would be delay, possibly a very long delay. The people
  feel very strongly on these things. Some of these temples are held in
  extraordinary reverence, places that you, Sire, may very likely have never
  heard of, but which are visited by hundreds daily. To sweep them away in any
  peremptory fashion would be dangerous. There would have to be ceremonies,
  expiations, and all the thousand things which the priests invent."</p>

  <p>"Well," exclaimed the Emperor after a pause, "what is to be done?"</p>

  <p>"Sire," replied Tigellinus, "cannot you modify your plan? Much might be
  done without this wholesale destruction."</p>

  <p>"Modify it!" thundered the Emperor. "Certainly not. It shall be all or
  nothing. Do you think that I am going to take all this trouble, and
  accomplish, after all, nothing more than what any ædile could have done?"</p>

  <p>He threw himself down on the couch and buried his face in the cushions.
  The Empress and the Minister watched and waited in serious disquiet. There
  was no knowing what wild resolve he might take. That he had set his heart to
  no common degree on this new scheme was evident. In all his life he had never
  given so much serious thought to any subject as he had to this, and
  disappointment would probably result in some dangerous outburst. After about
  half an hour had passed, he started up.</p>

  <p>"I have it," he cried; "it shall be done,&mdash;the plan, the whole
  plan."</p>

  <p>"Sire, will you deign to tell us what inspiration the gods have given
  you?" said Tigellinus.</p>

  <p>"All in good time," said the Emperor. "When I want your help I will tell
  you what it is needful for you to know. But now it is time for my harp
  practice. You will dine with us, Tigellinus, and for pity's sake bring some
  one who can give us some amusement. Antium is delightful in the daytime, but
  the evenings! . . ."</p>

  <p>"Madam," said Tigellinus, when the Emperor had left the room, "have you
  any idea what he is thinking of?"</p>

  <p>"I have absolutely none," replied Poppæa; "but I fear it may be something
  very strange. I noticed a dangerous light in his eyes. It has been there
  often lately. Do you think," she went on in a low voice, "there is any danger
  of his going mad? You know about his uncle Caius."</p>

  <p>"Don't trouble yourself with such fears," replied Tigellinus. "It is not
  likely. His mother had the coolest head of any woman that I have ever seen;
  and his father, whatever he was, was certainly not mad. And now, if you will
  excuse me, I have some business to attend to."</p>

  <p>He saluted the Empress and withdrew. Poppæa, little reassured by his
  words, remained buried in thought,&mdash;thought that was full of disquietude
  and alarm. She had gained all, and even more than all, that she had aimed at.
  She shared Nero's throne, not in name only, but in fact. But how dangerous
  was the height to which she had climbed! A single false step might
  precipitate her into an abyss which she shuddered to think of. He had spared
  no one, however near and dear to him. If his mood should change, would he
  spare her? And his mood might change. At present he loved her as ardently,
  she thought, as ever. But&mdash;for she watched him closely, as a keeper
  watches a wild beast&mdash;she could not help seeing that he was growing more
  and more restless and irritable. Once he had even lifted his hand against
  her. It was only a gesture, and checked almost in its beginning, but she
  could not forget it. "Oh!" she moaned to herself,&mdash;for, wicked as she
  was, she was a woman after all,&mdash;"Oh, if only my little darling had
  lived! Nero loved her so, and she would have softened him. But it was not to
  be! Why did I allow them to do all these foolish idolatries? And yet, how
  could I stop it? Still, I am sure that God was angry with me about them, and
  took the child away from me. And now there are these new troubles. I will
  send another offering to Jerusalem. This time it shall be a whole bunch of
  grapes for the golden vine."</p>

  <p>Poor creature! the thought of a sacrifice of justice and mercy never
  entered into her soul.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap02"
     name="chap02"></a>II. &mdash; THE HATCHING OF A PLOT</h2>

  <p class="first">ON the very day of the meeting described in my last chapter,
  a party of six friends was gathered together in the dining-room&mdash;I
  should rather say one of the dining-rooms&mdash;of a country house at Tibur.
  The view commanded by the window of the apartment was singularly lovely.
  Immediately below, the hillside, richly wooded with elm and chestnut, and
  here and there a towering pine, sloped down to the lower course of the river
  Anio. Beyond the river were meadow-lands, green with the unfailing moisture
  of the soil, and orchards in which the rich fruit was already gathering a
  golden hue. The magnificent falls of the river were in full view, but not so
  near as to make the roar of the descending water inconveniently loud. At the
  moment, the almost level rays of the setting sun illumined with a golden
  light that was indescribably beautiful the cloud of spray that rose from the
  pool in which the falling waters were received. It was an effect that was
  commonly watched with intense interest by visitors to the villa, for, indeed,
  it was just one of the beauties of nature which a Roman knew how to
  appreciate. Landscape, especially of the wilder sort, he did not care about;
  but the loveliness of a foreground, the greenery of a rich meadow, the deep
  shade of a wood, the clear water bubbling from a spring or leaping from a
  rock, these he could admire to the utmost. But on the present occasion the
  attention of the guests had been otherwise occupied. They had been listening
  to a recitation from their host. To listen to a recitation was often a price
  which guests paid for their entertainment, and paid somewhat unwillingly and
  even ungraciously. Rich dishes and costly wines, the rarest of flowers, and
  the most precious of perfumes were not very cheaply purchased by two hours of
  boredom from some dull oration or yet duller poem. There was no such feeling
  among the guests who were now assembled in this Tibur villa. The
  entertainment, indeed, had been simple and frugal, such as it befitted a
  young disciple of the Stoic school to give to a party of like-minded friends.
  But the intellectual entertainment that followed when the tables were removed
  had been a treat of the most delightful kind. This may be readily understood
  when I say that the host of the evening was Lucan, and that he had been
  reciting from his great poem of the Pharsalia the description of the battle
  from which it took its name. To modern readers of Latin literature who find
  their standard of excellence in Virgil and Horace, the Pharsalia sounds
  artificial and turgid. But it suited the taste of that age, all the more from
  the very qualities which make it less acceptable to us. And, beyond all
  doubt, it lent itself admirably to recitation. A modern reader often thinks
  it rhetoric rather than poetry. But the rhetoric was undeniably effective,
  especially when set off by the author's fiery declamation, and when the
  recitation came to an end with the well-known lines:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">"Italian fields of death, the blood-stained wave<br>
  That swept Sicilian shores, and that dark day<br>
  That reddened Actium's rocks, have wrought such woe,<br>
  Philippi's self seems guiltless by compare."</p>

  <p>It was followed by a round of genuine, even enthusiastic applause. When
  the applause had subsided there was an interval of silence that was scarcely
  less complimentary to the poet. This was broken at last by a remark from
  Licinius, a young soldier who had lately been serving against the Parthians
  under the great Corbulo, for many years the indefatigable and invincible
  guardian of the Eastern frontier of the Empire.</p>

  <p>"Lucan," he said, "would you object to repeat a few lines which occurred
  in your description of the sacrifices on either side before the beginning of
  the battle? We heard how all the omens were manifestly unfavourable to
  Pompey, and then there followed something that struck me very much about the
  prayers and vows of Cæsar."</p>

  <p>"I know what you mean," replied the poet; "I will repeat them with
  pleasure. They run thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">" 'But what dark thrones, what Furies of the pit,<br>
  Cæsar, didst thou invoke? The wicked hand<br>
  That waged with pitiless sword such impious war<br>
  Not to the heavens was lifted, but to Gods<br>
  That rule the nether world and Powers that veil<br>
  Their maddening presence in Eternal night.' "</p>

  <p>"Exactly so," said Licinius. "Those were the lines I meant. But will you
  recite this in public? How will Nero, who, after all, is the heir of Cæsar,
  and enjoys the harvests reaped at Mutina, and Actium, and Philippi, how will
  Nero relish such language?"</p>

  <p>"He is not likely to hear it. In fact, he has forbidden me to recite. He
  does not like rivals," he added with an air of indescribable scorn.</p>

  <p>"Indeed," said the young soldier; "then you have seen reason to change
  your opinions. I remember having the great pleasure of hearing you read your
  first book. I was just about to start to join my legion. It must have been
  about two years ago. I can't exactly recollect the lines, but you mentioned,
  I remember, Munda, and Mutina, and Actium, and then went on:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">" 'Yet great the debt our Roman fortunes owe<br>
  To civil strife, if this its end, to make<br>
  Great Nero lord of men....' "</p>

  <p>The other guests grew hot and cold at the more than military frankness
  with which their companion taxed their host with inconsistency. The
  inconsistency was notorious enough; but now that the poet had abandoned his
  flatteries and definitely ranged himself with the opposition, what need to
  recall it?</p>

  <p>Lucan could not restrain the blush that rose to his cheek, but he was
  ready with his answer.</p>

  <p>"The Nero of to-day is not the Nero of three years ago, for it was then
  that I wrote those lines."</p>

  <p>"Yet even then," whispered another of the guests to his neighbour, "he had
  murdered his brother and his mother."</p>

  <p>A somewhat awkward silence followed. Subrius, a tribune of the Prætorians,
  broke it by addressing himself to Licinius.</p>

  <p>"Licinius," he cried, "tell our friends what you were describing to me the
  other day."</p>

  <p>"You mean," said Licinius, "the ceremony of Tiridates' submission?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," replied Subrius.</p>

  <p>"Well," resumed the other, "it was certainly a sight that was well worth
  seeing. A more magnificent army than the Parthian's never was. How the King
  could have given in without fighting I cannot imagine, except that Corbulo
  fairly frightened him. I could hardly have believed that there were so many
  horse-soldiers in the world. But there they were, squadron after squadron,
  lancers, and archers, and swordsmen, each tribe with its own device, a
  serpent, or an eagle, or a star, or the crescent moon, till the eye could
  hardly reach to the last of them. The legions were ranged on the three sides
  of a hollow square, with a platform in the centre, and on the platform an
  image of the Emperor, seated on a throne of gold."</p>

  <p>"A truly Egyptian deity!" muttered the poet to himself.</p>

  <p>"King Tiridates," the soldier went on, "after sacrificing, came up, and
  kneeling on one knee, laid his crown at the feet of the statue."</p>

  <p>"Noble sight again!" whispered Lucan to his neighbour. "A man bowing down
  before a beast."</p>

  <p>"And Corbulo?" asked one of the guests, Lateranus by name, who had not
  hitherto spoken. "How did he bear himself on this occasion?"</p>

  <p>"As modestly as the humblest centurion in the army," replied Licinius.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was a glorious triumph for Rome," said Subrius the Prætorian;
  "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused, and looked with a meaning glance at Lateranus.</p>

  <p>Lateranus, who was sitting by the side of Lucan (indeed, it was to him
  that the poet had whispered his irreverent comments on the ceremony by the
  Euphrates), rose from his seat. The new speaker was a striking figure, if
  only on account of his huge stature and strength. But he had other claims to
  distinction; after a foolish and profligate youth, he had begun to take life
  seriously.</p>

  <p>"Will you excuse me?" he said to the host, and walking to the door opened
  it, examined the passage hat led to it, locked another door at the further
  end, and then returned to his place.</p>

  <p>"Walls have ears," he said, "but these, as far as I can judge, are deaf.
  We can all keep a secret, my friends?" he went on, looking round at the
  company.</p>

  <p>"To the death, if need be," cried Lucan.</p>

  <p>The four other guests murmured assent.</p>

  <p>"We may very likely be called upon to make good our words. If any one is
  of a doubtful mind, let him draw back in time."</p>

  <p>"Go on; we are all resolved," was the unanimous answer of the company.</p>

  <p>Did there seem nothing strange to you when our friend Licinius told us of
  the Parthian king laying his crown at the feet of Nero's statue? What has
  Nero done that he should receive such gifts? Our armies defend with their
  bodies the frontiers of Euphrates and the Rhine? They toil through Scythian
  snows and African sands. And for what? Who reaps the rewards of their valour
  and their toil? Why, this harp-player, this buffoon, who sets the trivial
  crowns which reward the victories of the stage above all the glories of Rome.
  And why? Because, forsooth, he is the grandson of Julia the adulteress! I
  acknowledge the greatness of Julius, of Augustus, even of Tiberius. It was
  not unworthy of Romans, if the gods denied them liberty, to be ruled by such
  men. But Caius the madman, and Claudius the pedant,&mdash;did some doubtful
  drops of Imperial blood entitle them to be masters of the human race? And
  Nero, murderer of his brother, his mother, his wife, how much longer is he
  going to pollute with riot and bloodshed the holy places of Rome? If a Brutus
  could be found to strike down the great dictator, will no one dare to inflict
  the vengeance of gods and men on this profligate boy?"</p>

  <p>"The man and the sword will not be wanting when the proper time shall
  come," said Subrius the Prætorian in a tone of grim resolve. "But Rome must
  have a ruler. When we shall have rid her of this tyrant, who is to
  succeed?"</p>

  <p>"Why not restore the Republic?" cried Lucan. "We have a Senate, we have
  Consuls, and all the old machinery of the Government of freedom. The great
  Augustus left these things, it would seem, of set purpose, against the day
  when they might be wanted again."</p>

  <p>"The Republic is impossible," cried Subrius; "even more impossible than it
  was a hundred years ago. What is the Senate but an assembly of worn-out
  nobles and cowardly and time-serving capitalists? I know there are
  exceptions; one of them is here to-night," he went on with a bow to
  Lateranus; "and there is Thrasea, who, I know, will make one of us, as soon
  as he knows what we are meditating. But the Senate as a whole is incapable.
  And the people, where is that to be found? Certainly not in this mob that
  cares for nothing but its dole of bread, its gladiators, and its
  chariot-races. No; the Republic is a dream. Rome must have a master. The gods
  send her one who is righteous as well as strong."</p>

  <p>"What say you of Corbulo, Licinius?" asked Sulpicius Asper, a captain of
  the Prætorians, who had hitherto taken no part in the conversation. "His
  record is not altogether spotless. But he is a great soldier, and one might
  conjure with his name. And then his presence is magnificent, and the people
  love a stately figure. Do you think that the thought has ever crossed his
  mind?"</p>

  <p>"Corbulo," replied Licinius, "is a soldier, and nothing but a soldier. And
  he is absolutely devoted to the Emperor. I remember how ill he took it when
  some one at his table said something that sounded like censure. 'Silence!' he
  thundered. 'Emperors and gods are above praise and dispraise.' I verily
  believe that if Nero bade him kill himself he would plunge his sword into his
  breast without a murmur. No, it is idle to think of Corbulo. In fact he is
  one of the great difficulties that we should have to reckon with. Happily he
  is far off, and the business will be done before he hears of it."</p>

  <p>"There is Verginius on the Rhine," said Subrius. "What of him?"</p>

  <p>"An able man, none abler, if he will only consent."</p>

  <p>"And Sulpicius Galba in Spain. What of him?"</p>

  <p>"He is half worn-out," said Lateranus; "but he has the advantage of being
  one of the best born men in Rome. And the old names have not yet lost their
  power."</p>

  <p>"Why not a philosopher?" asked Lucan after a pause. "Plato thought that
  philosophers were the fittest men to rule the world."</p>

  <p>"Are you thinking of your uncle Seneca?" asked Lateranus. "For my part I
  think that it would be a pity to take him away from his books; and to speak
  the truth, if I may do so without offence, Seneca, though he is beyond doubt
  one of the greatest ornaments of Rome, has not played the part of an
  Emperor's teacher with such success that we could hope very much from him,
  were he Emperor himself."</p>

  <p>"There are, and indeed must be, objections to every name," said Licinius
  after a pause. "The soldiers will take it ill if the dignity should go to a
  civilian; and if the choice falls on a soldier, then all the other soldiers
  will be jealous. Tell me, Subrius, would you Prætorians be content if the
  legions were to choose an Emperor?"</p>

  <p>Subrius shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"As for the armies of the East," Licinius went on, "I know how fiercely
  they would resent dictation from the West! Our friend Asper here, who, if I
  remember right, has been aide-de-camp to Verginius, knows whether the German
  legions would be more disposed to submit to a mandate from the Euphrates.
  What say you, Asper?"</p>

  <p>Asper could do nothing better than imitate the action of his superior
  officer.</p>

  <p>Licinius went on: "I am a soldier myself, and can therefore speak more
  freely on this subject. We have to choose between evils. Jealousy between one
  great army and another can scarcely fail to end in war. The general
  discontent of all the armies, if a civilian succeeds to the throne, will be
  less acute, and therefore less dangerous. What say you to Calpurnius
  Piso?"</p>

  <p>"At least," cried Lucan, "he has the merit of not being a
  philosopher."</p>

  <p>There was a general laugh at this sally. Piso was a noted bon vivant and
  man of fashion, and generally as unlike a philosopher in his habits and ways
  of life as could be conceived.</p>

  <p>"Exactly so," said Licinius, undisturbed by the remark; "and this, strange
  as it may seem, is one of the qualities which commend him to those who look
  at things as they are, and not as they ought to be. This is not the time for
  Consuls who leave their ploughs to put on the robes of office. The age is not
  equal to such simple virtues. It wants magnificence; it demands that its
  heroes should be well-dressed and drive fine horses and keep up a splendid
  establishment. It is not averse to a reputation for luxury. Piso has such a
  reputation, and I must own that it does not do him injustice. But he is a man
  of honour, and he has some solid and many showy qualities. He has noble
  birth; a pedigree that shows an ancestor who fought at Cannæ is more than
  respectable. He is eloquent, he is wealthy, but can give with a liberal hand
  as well as spend, and he has the gift of winning hearts. And then he is bold.
  We may look long, my friends, before we find a better man than Piso."</p>

  <p>"There is a great deal of truth in what you say; more truth than it is
  pleasant to acknowledge," said Lateranus. "But we must weigh this matter
  seriously. Meanwhile, will Piso join us?"</p>

  <p>"I feel as certain of it as I could be of any matter not absolutely within
  my knowledge," replied Licinius. "Will you authorize me to sound him? Whether
  he agree or not, I can guarantee his silence."</p>

  <p>Many other matters and men were discussed; and before the party separated
  it was arranged that each of the six friends should choose one person to be
  enrolled in the undertaking.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap03"
     name="chap03"></a>III. &mdash; IN THE CIRCUS</h2>

  <p class="first">TWO days after the conversation related in my last chapter
  Subrius and Lateranus were deep in consultation in the library of the
  latter's mansion on the Esquiline Hill. The subject that occupied them was,
  of course, the same that had been started on that occasion.</p>

  <p>"Licinius tells me," said the Prætorian, "that he has spoken to Piso, and
  that he caught eagerly at the notion. I must confess that at first I was
  averse to the man. It seemed a pity to throw away so magnificent an
  opportunity. What good might not an honest, capable man do, if he were put in
  this place? It is no flattery, but simple truth, that the Emperor is a
  Jupiter on earth. But it seems hopeless to look for the ideal man. That
  certainly Piso is not. But he is resolute, and he means well, and he will be
  popular. He is not the absolute best, the four-square and faultless man that
  the philosophers talk about; very far from it. But then the faultless man
  would not please the Romans, if I know them; and to do the Romans, or, for
  the matter of that, any men, good, you must please them first."</p>

  <p>"And how does the recruiting go on?" asked Lateranus.</p>

  <p>"Excellently well," said Subrius, "within the limits that are set, that
  every man should choose one associate. Asper and Sulpicius have both chosen
  comrades, and can answer for their loyalty as for themselves. Lucan has taken
  Scævinus. I should hardly have thought that the lazy creature had so much
  energy in him; but these sleepy looking fellows sometimes wake up with
  amazing energy. Proculus has chosen Senecio, who is one of the Emperor's
  inner circle of friends."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" interrupted Lateranus, "that sounds dangerous."</p>

  <p>"There is no cause for fear; Senecio, I happen to know, has very good
  reasons for being with us, and, of course, he is a most valuable acquisition.
  When the hour comes to strike, we shall know how and where to deal the blow.
  Then there is Proculus, whom you have chosen. And finally I, I flatter
  myself, have done well. Whom think you I have secured?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it would be difficult to guess. Your fellow tribune Statius,
  perhaps. I should guess that he is an honest man, who would like to serve a
  better master than he has got at present."</p>

  <p>"Statius is well enough, and we shall have him with us sure enough when
  the time shall come. But meanwhile I have been doing better things than that.
  What should you say," he went on, dropping his voice to a whisper, "if I were
  to tell you that it is Fænius Rufus?"</p>

  <p>"What, the Prefect?" asked Lateranus in tones of the liveliest
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes" replied Subrius; "the Prefect himself."</p>

  <p>"That is admirable!" cried the other. "We not have hoped for anything so
  good. But how did you approach him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! that was not so difficult. To tell you the truth, he met me at least
  half- way. These things are always in the air. Depend upon it, there are
  hundreds of people thinking much the same things that you and I are thinking,
  though not, perhaps, in quite so definite a way. And why not? The same causes
  have been at work in them as in us, and brought about much the same
  result."</p>

  <p>"True! but we must be first in the field. So we must make haste."</p>

  <p>"There I agree heartily with you. Delay in such matters is fatal. The
  secret is sure to leak out. And with every new man we take into our
  confidence&mdash;and we must add a good many more to our number&mdash;the
  danger becomes greater. Will you come with me on a little visit that I am
  going to pay? I have an acquaintance whom I should like you to see. He may be
  useful to us in this matter. I will tell you about him. In the first place, I
  would have you know that my friend is a gladiator."</p>

  <p>Lateranus raised his eyebrows. "A gladiator!" he exclaimed in a doubtful
  tone. "He might be useful in certain contingencies. But he would hardly suit
  our purpose just now."</p>

  <p>"Listen to his story," said Subrius. "I assure you that it is well worth
  hearing; and I shall be much surprised, if, when you have heard it, you don't
  agree with me that Fannius, for that is my friend's name, is a very fine
  fellow. Well, to begin with, he is a Roman citizen."</p>

  <p>"Great Jupiter!" interrupted Lateranus, "you astonish me more and more. A
  citizen gladiator, and yet a fine fellow! I never knew one that was not a
  thorough-paced scoundrel."</p>

  <p>"Very likely," replied the Prætorian calmly. "Yet Fannius you will find to
  be an exception to your rule. But to my story. The elder Fannius rented a
  farm of mine three or four miles this side of Alba. He might have made a good
  living out of it. There was some capital meadow land, a fair vineyard, and as
  good a piece of arable as is to be found in the country. His father had had
  it before him. In fact, the family were old tenants, and the rent had never
  been raised for at least a hundred years. Then there was only one son, and he
  was a hard- working young fellow who more than earned his own keep. The
  father ought, I am sure, to have laid by money; but he was one of those weak,
  good-natured fellows, who seem incapable of keeping a single denarius in
  their pockets. It is only fair to say that he was always ready to share his
  purse with a friend. In fact, his practice of foolishly lending helped him to
  his ruin as much as anything else. That, and the wine-cup, and the dice-box
  were too much for him. About five years ago, a brother-in-law&mdash;his dead
  wife's brother, you must understand&mdash;died suddenly, leaving an only
  daughter, with some fifty thousand sesterces for her fortune, not a bad sum
  for a girl in her rank of life. He had been living, if I remember right, at
  Tarentum, and, knowing nothing about his brother-in-law's embarrassments, he
  had naturally made him his daughter's guardian and trustee. Fannius, who was
  at his wit's end to know where to find money, his farm being already
  mortgaged up to the hilt, accepted the trust only too willingly. The son,
  disgusted at seeing extravagance and waste which he could not stop, had gone
  away from home, and was serving under Corbulo. Perhaps if he had been here,
  he might have been able to put a stop to the business. Well, to make a long
  story short, the elder Fannius appropriated the money little by little. Of
  course he was always intending to make it good. There was to be a good
  harvest, or a good vintage, or, what, I believe, he really trusted in more
  than anything else, a great run of luck at the gaming- table. Equally of
  course he never got anything of the kind. Then came the crash. The younger
  Fannius came back with his discharge from the East, and found his father
  lying dead in the house. There can be no doubt he had killed himself. The son
  discovered in the old man's desk a letter addressed to himself in which he
  told the whole story. The girl was living with an aunt. He had always
  continued, somehow or other, to pay the interest on her money. She was going
  to be married, and the capital would have to be forthcoming. This, I take it,
  was the final blow, and the old man saw no other way of getting out of his
  trouble but suicide. Suicide, by the way, is pretty often a way of shoving
  one's own trouble on to somebody else's shoulders. Well, the poor fellow came
  to me. He had brought home a little pay and prize-money. I forgave him what
  rent was due, and bought whatever there was to sell on the farm&mdash;not
  that there was much of this, I assure you. So he got a little sum of money
  together, enough to pay the old man's debts. But then there was the niece's
  fortune. How was that to be raised? It was absolutely gone; not a denarius of
  it left. I would have helped if I could, but I was positively at the end of
  my means. Still I could have raised the money, if I had known what young
  Fannius was going to do. But he said nothing to me or to any one else. He
  went straight to the master of the gladiators' school and enlisted. You see
  his strength and skill in arms were all he had to dispose of, and so, to save
  his father's honour and his cousin's happiness, he sold them, and, of course,
  himself with them. It was indeed selling himself. You know, I dare say, how
  the oath runs which a free man takes when he enlists as a gladiator?"</p>

  <p>"No; I do not remember to have heard it."</p>

  <p>"Well, it runs thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>" 'I, Caius Fannius, do take hereby the oath of obedience to Marius,
  that I will consent to be burnt, bound, beaten, slain with the sword, or
  whatever else the said Marius shall command, and I do most solemnly devote
  both soul and body to my said master, as being legally his
  gladiator.'</i></p>

  <p>"The young man had no difficulty in making good terms for himself. He was
  the most famous swordsman of his tribe. Indeed, I don't know that he had his
  match in the whole Field of Mars. He got his fifty thousand sesterces, paid
  the money over just in time to prevent the truth coming out, and thus
  cheerfully put his neck under this yoke. What do you say to that? Have I made
  good my words?"</p>

  <p>"To the full," cried Lateranus enthusiastically. "He is a hero; nothing
  less."</p>

  <p>The two friends had by this time arrived at their destination, "the
  gladiators' school," as it was called, kept by a certain Thraso. Subrius
  inquired at one of the doors whether he could see Fannius, the
  Samnite&mdash;for it was in this particular corps of gladiators,
  distinguished by their high-crested helmet and oblong shield, that the young
  man was enrolled.</p>

  <p>"He has just sat down to the midday meal," said the doorkeeper.</p>

  <p>"Then we will not disturb him, but will wait till he has finished,"
  replied Subrius.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to see the boys at their exercises, sir?" asked the man,
  an old Prætorian, who had served under Subrius when the latter was a
  centurion. "They have their meal earlier, and are at work now."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Subrius, and the doorkeeper called an attendant, who
  conducted the two friends to the training-room of the boys.</p>

  <p>It was a curious spectacle that met their eyes. The room into which they
  were ushered was of considerable size and was occupied at this time by some
  sixty lads, ranging in age from ten to sixteen, who were practising various
  games or exercises under the eyes of some half-a-dozen instructors. Some were
  leaping over the bar, either unaided or with the help of a pole; others were
  lunging with blunt swords at lay figures; others, again, were practising with
  javelins at a mark. With every group there stood a trainer who explained how
  the thing was to be done, and either praised or blamed the performance. Every
  unfavourable comment, it might have been noticed, was always emphasized by
  the application of a whip. Did the competitor fail to clear the bar at a
  certain height, fixed according to his age and stature, did he strike the lay
  figure outside a certain line which was supposed to mark the vital parts, did
  his javelin miss the mark by a certain distance, the whip descended with an
  unfailing certainty on the unlucky competitor's shoulders. Even the
  vanquished of two wrestlers, whose obstinate struggle excited a keen interest
  in the visitors, met with the common lot, though he had shown very
  considerable skill, and had indeed been vanquished only by the superior
  weight and strength of his adversary.</p>

    <p class="caption">Boys Wrestling.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>From the boys' apartment the friends went in to see the wild beasts. The
  show of these creatures was indeed magnificent, and, in fact, unheard of sums
  had been expended on obtaining them. The Emperor was determined to outdo all
  his predecessors in the variety and splendour of his exhibitions. Nor were
  his extravagances wholly unreasonable. A ruler who was not a soldier, who
  could not, therefore, entertain the Roman populace with the gorgeous display
  of a triumph, had now to fall back upon other ways of at once keeping them in
  good humour and impressing them with a sense of his greatness. The whole
  world, so to speak, had been ransacked to make the collection complete.
  Twenty lions, magnificent specimens most of them, had been brought from
  Northern Africa. To secure these monarchs of the desert, the most famous
  hunters of Mauretania had been engaged for pay commensurate with the perils
  and hardships which they had to undergo.</p>

  <p>"I am told, sir," said the doorkeeper, "that they cost, one with another,
  fifty thousand sesterces apiece. It is the taking them alive, you see, that
  makes it so expensive. And the pits, too, which are one way of doing this,
  often break their bones. So they are mostly netted; and netting a lion is
  nasty work. That fellow there"&mdash;he pointed as he spoke to a particularly
  powerful male&mdash;"killed, they tell me, four men before they got him into
  the cage."</p>

  <p>Next to the lions were the tigers. They, it seemed, had been even more
  costly than their neighbours, for they had come considerably further. Secured
  among the Hyrcanian Mountains, they had been brought down to the Babylonian
  plains, embarked on board rafts on the Euphrates, and so carried down to the
  sea. The long and tedious journey had killed half of them before they could
  be landed at Brindisium, and their average cost had been at least half as
  much again as that of the lions. Panthers from Cilicia, bears from the Atlas
  Mountains, and from the Pyrenees, elks from the forests of Gaul and Germany,
  were also to be seen, and with them multitudes of apes and monkeys, and whole
  flocks of ostriches, flamingoes, and other birds conspicuous either for size
  or plumage.</p>

  <p>The man was particularly communicative about the elephants. An Indian, he
  said, had been hired to bring over a troop of performing animals of this
  kind, and their cleverness and docility were almost beyond belief.</p>

  <p>"One of them," he told Subrius and his companion," can write his name with
  his trunk in Greek characters on the sand. Another has got, the keeper tells
  me, as far as writing a whole verse. A third can add and subtract. This last,
  having failed one day in his task, and being docked of part of his food, was
  found studying his lesson by himself in his house. You smile, sir," he said,
  seeing that Lateranus could not keep his countenance. "I only tell you what
  the keeper told me, but I can almost believe anything after what I have seen
  myself. And then their agility, sir, is something marvellous, even
  incredible. Who would think that these big creatures, which look so clumsy,
  can walk on a tight-rope. Yet that I have seen with my own eyes. And the man
  promises a more wonderful display than that. We are to have four elephants
  walking on the tight-rope and carrying between them a litter with a sick
  companion in it." At this the friends laughed outright.</p>

  <p>"Clemens," said Subrius, "what traveller's tales are these?"</p>

  <p>"I can only say," returned the man, "that my head is all in a whirl from
  what I have seen with my own eyes and heard during the last few days."</p>

  <p>"Fannius will have finished by this time," said Subrius, when they had
  completed the round of the cages. "Lead the way, Clemens."</p>

  <p>It was a singular sight that presented itself to the two friends as they
  stood surveying the scene at the door of the room in which the gladiators had
  been taking their meal. It was a large chamber, not less than a hundred feet
  in length by about half as many in breadth. The number of gladiators was
  about eighty, but as this was one of the afternoons on which the men were
  accustomed to receive their relatives and friends, there must have been
  present nearly four times as many persons. Some of the better known men were
  surrounded by little circles of admirers, who listened to everything that
  they had to say with a devotion at least equal to that with which the
  students of philosophy or literature were accustomed to hang upon the lips of
  their teachers. The gladiators bragged of what they had done or were about to
  do, or, putting themselves into attitudes, rehearsed a favourite stroke, or
  explained one of those infallible ways to victory which seem so often,
  somehow or other, to end in defeat. Others sat in sullen and stupid silence,
  others were already asleep, somnolence being, as Aristotle had long before
  remarked, a special characteristic of the athletic habit of body. The men
  were of various types and races, but the faces were, almost without
  exception, marked by strong passions and low intelligence.</p>

  <p>"On the whole," said Lateranus, after watching the scene for a few
  minutes, "I prefer the brutes that do not pretend to be men. Lions and tigers
  are far nobler animals than these wretches; and as for elephants, whether or
  no we believe our friend Clemens' marvellous stories about them, it would be
  an insult even to compare them, so gentle, so teachable, so sagacious as they
  are, with these savages."</p>

  <p>"True in a general way," said the Prætorian, "yet even here Terence's
  dictum could be applied. Even here there is something of human interest. Look
  at that stout fellow there."</p>

  <p>Lateranus turned his eyes in the direction to which his companion pointed.
  The "stout fellow" was a gigantic negro.</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens!" cried Lateranus in astonishment, for a pure-blood negro
  was still a somewhat uncommon sight in Rome. "Did you ever see the like? Or
  have they trained some gigantic ape to bear himself like a man?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied the Prætorian, who had a soldier's appreciation of an
  athletic frame. "If so, they have trained it very well. I warrant he will be
  an awkward adversary for any one whom the lot may match with him when the day
  shall come."</p>

  <p>"May be," said the other; "but what a face! what lips! what a nose! what
  hair! To think that nature should ever have created anything so hideous!"</p>

  <p>"But see," cried Subrius, "there is one person at least who seems not to
  have found our black friend so very unsightly."</p>

  <p>And, indeed, at the moment there came up to the negro a pretty little
  woman whose fair complexion and diminutive stature exhibited a curious
  contrast to his ebony hue and gigantic proportions. To judge from the blue
  colour of her eyes and the reddish gold of her hair, she was a Gaul, possibly
  belonging to one of the tribes which had been settled for many generations in
  the Lombard plains, possibly from beyond the Alps. Further Gaul had now been
  thoroughly latinized, and its people were no longer strangers in Italy. She
  carried in her arms a little whitey brown baby, whose complexion, features,
  and half woolly hair indicated clearly enough his mixed parentage. The negro
  took the child from her arms, his mouth opening with a grin of delight which
  showed a dazzlingly white array of teeth.</p>

  <p>"See," cried Lateranus, "Hector, Andromache, and Astyanax over again! Only
  Hector seems to have borrowed for the time the complexion of Memnon!"</p>

  <p>"But we are forgetting our friend Fannius," said Subrius. "Where is he?
  Ah! there I see him," he exclaimed, after scanning for a minute or so the
  motley crowd which so thronged the room as to make it difficult to
  distinguish any one person. "And he, too, seems to have an Andromache. I
  thought he was an obstinate bachelor. But in that matter there are no
  surprises for a wise man."</p>

  <p>Fannius was just at that moment bidding farewell to two women. About the
  elder of the two there was nothing remarkable. She was a stout, elderly,
  commonplace person, respectably dressed in a style that seemed to indicate
  the wife of a small tradesman or well-to-do mechanic. The younger woman was a
  handsome, even distinguished looking girl of one and twenty or thereabouts.
  Her features were Greek, though not, perhaps, of the finest type. A deep
  brunette in complexion, she had soft, velvety brown eyes that seemed to speak
  of a mixture of Syrian blood. This, too, had given an arch to her finely
  chiselled nose, and a certain fulness, which was yet remote from the
  suspicion of anything coarse, to her crimson lips. Perhaps her mouth was her
  most remarkable feature. Any one who could read physiognomies would have
  noticed at once the firmness of its lines. The chin, just a little squarer
  than an Apelles, seeking absolutely ideal features for his Aphrodite, would
  perhaps have approved, but still delicately moulded, harmonized with the
  mouth. So did the resolute pose of her figure, and the erect, vigorous
  carriage of the head. She was dressed in much the same manner as the elder
  woman, naturally with a little more style, but with no pretension to rank.
  Yet at the moment when the two friends observed the group she was reaching
  her hand to Fannius with the air of a princess, and the gladiator was kissing
  it with all the devotion of a subject. The next moment she dropped a heavy
  veil over her face and turned away.</p>

  <p>The gladiator stood looking at her as she moved away, so lost in thought
  that he did not notice the approach of Subrius and his companion.</p>

  <p>"Well, Fannius," cried the Prætorian, slapping him heartily on the
  shoulder, "shall we find you, too, keeping festival on the Kalends of
  March?"</p>

  <p>Fannius turned round and saluted. The Prætorian, after formally returning
  the salute, warmly clasped his odd acquaintance by the hand, a token of
  friendship which made the gladiator, who remembered only too acutely the
  degradation of his position, blush with pleasure.</p>

  <p>"You are pleased to jest, noble Subrius, about the worshipful goddess.
  What has a poor gladiator, who cannot call his life his own for more than a
  few hours to do with marriage? And Epicharis, though Venus knows I love her
  as my own soul, has her thought on very different matters."</p>

  <p>"Well, well, never despair!" returned the Tribune. "Venus will touch the
  haughty fair some day with her whip. But, Fannius, when are you coming to see
  me? It seems an age since we had a talk together. My friend here, too, who is
  to be Consul next year, wishes to make your acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"I am not my own master, you know; but if I can get leave, I will come to-
  night."</p>

  <p>"So be it; at the eleventh hour I shall expect you."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap04"
     name="chap04"></a>IV. &mdash; A NEW ALLY</h2>

  <p class="first">"LATERANUS," said the Prætorian to his friend, as they sat
  together after dinner, "did you notice the face of the girl who was taking
  leave of our friend Fannius when we first espied him this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed, I did," said the Consul elect; "it was a face that no one
  could help noticing, and having once seen, could hardly forget."</p>

  <p>"That is exactly as it struck me; and I am sure that I have seen it
  before; and not so very long ago. But where? That puzzles me. Now and then I
  seem to have it, but then it slips away again. Depend upon it, she is no
  ordinary woman. Very beautiful she is, but somehow it is not the beauty, but
  the resolute strength of her face that impresses one. And what did the man
  mean when he said that she 'thought about other things.' I have a sort of
  presentiment that she will help us."</p>

  <p>"You surprise me," said Lateranus. "And yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At this point he was interrupted by the appearance of a slave who
  announced the arrival of the expected guest.</p>

  <p>For some time the conversation was general, Fannius taking his part in it
  with an ease and readiness that surprised Lateranus, and even exceeded the
  expectations of his old friend and landlord. It naturally turned, before very
  long, on the details of life in the "gladiators' school." Fannius explained
  that he had only a few more weeks to serve. After the next show, which was to
  take place in September, he would be entitled to his discharge. He had been
  extraordinarily successful in his profession, and the "golden youth" of Rome,
  who had backed him against competitors, and won not a little by his
  victories, had made him liberal presents. "You have always taken a kind
  interest in my fortunes," he said to Subrius, "and I am not afraid of
  worrying you with these matters. If I live to receive the wooden sword, I
  shall have a comfortable independence. But who knows what may happen? a
  gladiator, least of all. You know, sir, the proverb about the pitcher and the
  fountain. And that reminds me of a little service that I have been thinking
  of asking you to do for me. I should even have ventured to call, if you had
  not been kind enough to come. I want you to take charge of what I have been
  able to save. I should have made a will, and asked you to do me the service
  of seeing its provisions carried out in case of need, but I feel doubtful
  whether, situated as I am, I can make a will that would be valid. What I will
  ask you to do, then, will be this, to take charge of my property now, and if
  anything should happen to me, to distribute it according to the directions
  contained in this paper."</p>

  <p>"Very good," replied Subrius. "The gods forbid that there should arise any
  need for my services, but, if there should, you may be sure that I will not
  fail in my duty as your friend."</p>

  <p>"Many thanks, sir," said Fannius, producing some papers from his pocket.
  "These are acknowledgments from Cassius, the banker, of deposits which I have
  made with him. Thras has charge of what I possess in coin, and will have
  instructions to hand it over to you. And here is the paper of directions.
  Will you please to read it? Is it quite plain?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly so," answered the Tribune. "But there is one question which I
  must take the liberty of asking. You mention a certain Epicharis. Who is she?
  Where am I to look for her?"</p>

  <p>"She lives with her aunt by marriage. Galla is the aunt's name, and she
  cultivates a little farm on this side of Gabii. Any one there will direct you
  to it. She is the young woman whom you saw speaking to me this
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>"I guessed as much," said Subrius, "and I have been puzzling myself ever
  since trying to make sure whether I had seen her before."</p>

  <p>"That you might very easily have done," replied the gladiator. "She was
  much with the Empress Octavia. Indeed, she was her foster-sister."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" cried Subrius; "that accounts for it. Now I remember all about it. I
  was on guard in the Palace with my cohort on the day when the Empress Octavia
  was sent away to Campania. My men were lining the stairs as the Empress came
  down. The poor Empress was almost fainting. Two of her women were supporting
  her, one on each side. I remember how much struck I was with the look of one
  of them, far more Imperial, I thought, than that of the unhappy creature she
  was holding up. 'That is a woman,' I said to myself, 'whom no man will wrong
  with impunity!' It was not a face to be forgotten. I remembered it at once
  when I saw it this afternoon; but I could not fix the time and place. Now you
  have enlightened me."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said Fannius, "you are right; she was with the Empress then;
  indeed, she remained with her till her death. Oh! sir, it is a piteous story
  that she tells. But perhaps I had better not speak about those things."</p>

  <p>"Speak on without fear," replied the Prætorian. "I am one of the Emperor's
  soldiers, and my friend here has received the honour of the Consulship from
  him; but we have not therefore ceased to be Romans and men. Whatever you may
  tell us will be safely kept&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The speaker paused, and then added in a deliberate and meaning tone, "As
  long as it may be necessary to keep it."</p>

  <p>The gladiator cast a quick glance at him, and resumed. "Well, Epicharis
  was with her mistress from the unlucky day when she was carried across the
  threshold of her husband's house, down to the very end. They were both
  children then, only twelve years of age, and the poor Empress was really
  never anything else. But Epicharis soon learnt to be a woman. From almost the
  first she had to protect her mistress. Nero never loved his wife. Epicharis
  says she was too good for him, or, indeed, for almost any man; that she ought
  to have had a philosopher or a priest for her husband."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that philosophers or priests are better than other men,"
  interrupted Subrius; "but go on."</p>

  <p>"Well, as I said, Nero never loved her, but, for a time, he was decently
  civil to her. Then her brother died, was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Was poisoned, you were going to say," said Subrius. "That is no secret.
  Everybody in Rome knows it."</p>

  <p>"Epicharis tells me that the Empress never shed a tear. She had learnt to
  hide her feelings, as children do when they are afraid of their elders. Then
  the Empress-mother came by her end. As long as she was alive the wife's lot
  was tolerable. But after that&mdash;oh! gentlemen, I could not bring myself
  to say a tenth of the things that I have heard. They are too dreadful. The
  poorest, unhappiest woman had not so much to bear. I used to think when I was
  a boy that the fine ladies who lived in great houses, and were dressed in gay
  silks, and rode about in soft cushioned carriages, must be happy; but now
  that I have had a look at what goes on behind palace walls, I don't think so
  any more. Then came what you saw, sir, on the palace stairs. It is no wonder
  that the poor Empress should look miserable after what she had gone through
  in those days, seeing, for instance, her slave-girls tortured in the hope
  that something might be wrung out of them against her. Epicharis herself they
  did not touch; she was free, you see; but they threatened her. I warrant they
  got nothing by that. She has a tongue, and knows how to use it. She let that
  monster Tigellinus know what she thought of him, and his master too. She has
  told me that she saw the Emperor wince once and again at the answers she
  made. Then Octavia was sent away. It was a great relief to go; to be away
  from the dreadful palace. She ran about the gardens and grounds of the
  villa,&mdash;it was to Burrus' house near Misenum, you will remember, she was
  sent,&mdash;and made friends with the little children; in fact, she was
  happier than she had ever been in her life before. 'Now that I am out of
  their way, and do not interfere with their plans, they will let me alone,
  and, perhaps, forget me.' This is what she would say to Epicharis. 'I am sure
  that I don't want to marry again, and you had better follow my example, dear
  sister,'&mdash;she would often call Epicharis 'sister.' 'Husbands seem very
  strange creatures, so difficult to please, and always imagining such strange
  things about one. You and I will live together for the rest of our lives, and
  take care of the poor people. It really is much nicer than Rome, which, you
  know, I never really liked.' So she would go on. She did not seem to have any
  fears, the relief of being free after eight years' slavery&mdash;for really
  her life was nothing else&mdash;was so great. But Epicharis never deceived
  herself, though she had not the heart to undeceive her mistress. Indeed, what
  would have been the good? The poor woman was fast in the toils, and the
  hunters were sure to come. But it was of no use to tell her so, and make her
  miserable before the time. But, as I said, Epicharis was clever enough to
  know what the end must be. She was sure that Nero would never let Octavia
  alone."</p>

  <p>"No," said Subrius; "he had wronged her far too deeply ever to be able to
  forgive."</p>

  <p>"Just so," observed Lateranus; "and if he could have done it there was
  Poppæa, and a woman never spares a rival, especially a rival who is better
  than herself. Besides he dared not let his divorced wife live. You see she
  was the daughter of Claudius, and her husband, supposing that she had married
  again, would have been dangerously near the throne. And then the people loved
  her; that was even more against her than anything else."</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what Epicharis thought, so she has often told me. After a
  few days came news that there had been great disturbances in Rome; that the
  people had stood up like one man in the Circus, and shouted out to the
  Emperor, 'Give us back Octavia!' and that Nero had annulled the divorce. Some
  of the poor woman's attendants were in high spirits. You see they did not
  like Campania and a quiet country house as much as their mistress did. 'Now,'
  they said, 'we shall get back to Rome; after all, a palace is better than a
  villa.' Next day the news was more exciting than ever. There had been a great
  demonstration all over Rome as soon as it was known that the divorce had been
  cancelled, and that Octavia was Empress again. The people had crowded into
  the capital and returned thanks in the temples. Poppæa's image had been
  thrown down, and Octavia's covered with flowers and set up in the public
  places. The Empress' women, foolish creatures that they were, were more
  delighted than ever. 'Now,' they said, 'we shall be going back to Rome in
  triumph.' But Epicharis knew better; she was quite sure that this was only
  the beginning of the end. And, as you know, gentlemen, she was right; before
  the end of another week the soldiers had come from Rome."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Subrius, "a lucky fever-fit saved me from being sent on that
  errand. My cohort had been detailed for the duty; the sealed orders, which I
  was not to open till I reached the villa, had been handed to me; and then at
  the last moment, when I was racking my brain, thinking how I could possibly
  get off, there fortunately came this attack. I never had thought before that
  I should be positively glad to have the ague."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, from what Epicharis has told me, you were spared one of the
  most pitiable sights that human eyes ever saw. Octavia was sitting in the
  garden when the Tribune came up and saluted her. She gave him her hand to
  kiss. 'I suppose you have come to take me back to Rome,' she said. 'Well, I
  am sorry to leave this beautiful place; but if my husband and the people
  really want me, I am willing to come. Can you give me till to-morrow to get
  ready?' The Tribune turned away. Epicharis says that she saw him brush his
  hand over his eyes."</p>

  <p>"Well," interrupted the Prætorian, "it must have been something to make
  that brute Severus&mdash;for he was on duty in my place, I
  remember&mdash;shed a tear."</p>

  <p>" ' Madam,' said the Tribune, 'you mistake. We have come on another
  business. You are not to return to Rome. We are to take you to Pandataria.'
  'Pandataria!' cried the poor child, roused to anger, as even the gentlest
  will sometimes be; 'but that is a place for wicked people. I have done
  nothing wrong; else why should the Emperor have made me his wife again!'
  'Madam,' said the Tribune, 'I have to obey my orders.' After that she said
  nothing more. After all, she was a little relieved that she was not to return
  to Rome, and she did not know what going to Pandataria really meant. Well,
  that very night she was hurried off; only one attendant was allowed her.
  Tigellinus, I fancy, had forgotten that Epicharis, whom he had plenty of
  reason to distrust and hate, was with her. Anyhow he had given no directions
  to the Tribune, and the Tribune was not disposed to go beyond his orders in
  making the poor banished woman unhappy. So Epicharis went. The island, she
  told me, was a wretched place; as to the house, it was almost in ruins. The
  shepherd who looks after the few sheep, which are almost the only creatures
  on the island, said that scarcely anything had been done to it since the
  Princess Julia left it, and that must have been nearly sixty years before.
  However, she seemed to reconcile herself to the place easily enough. It was
  her delight to wander about on the shore, picking up shells and seaweeds.
  Such things pleased her as they please a child, Poor creature! she had not
  time to get tired of it. In the course of about fourteen or fifteen days a
  ship came with some soldiers on board&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They told us in Rome," said Subrius, "that she was killed by falling from
  a cliff, and possibly had thrown herself off."</p>

  <p>"Epicharis tells a very different story. When the Empress saw the
  soldiers, she said in a very cheerful voice&mdash;you see she had not the
  least idea that her life was in danger, and Epicharis had never had the heart
  to tell her,&mdash;'Well, gentlemen, what is you business this time? Where
  are you going to take me now? I must confess that I liked Misenum better than
  this.' 'Madam,' said the Centurion in command 'with your permission I will
  explain my business when I get to the house, if you will be pleased to return
  thither.' He said this, you see, to gain time. On the way back he contrived
  to whisper into Epicharis' ear what his errand really was. She knew it
  already well enough, you may be sure. 'You must break it to her,' he said.
  That was an awful thing for the poor girl to do. She is not of the tearful
  sort,&mdash;you know; but she sobbed and wept as if her heart would break,
  when she told me the story. The Empress went up to her bed-chamber to make
  some little change in her dress. As she was sitting before the glass,
  Epicharis came and put her arms round her neck. The Empress turned round a
  little surprised. You see she would often kiss and embrace her foster-
  sister, but it was always she that began the caress and the other that
  returned it. 'What ails you, darling?' she said, for Epicharis' eyes were
  full of tears. 'O dearest lady, I cannot help crying when I think that we
  shall have to part!' 'Surely,' said the Empress, 'they are not going to be so
  cruel as to take you away from me. I will write to the Emperor about it; he
  can't refuse me this little favour.' 'O lady,' said Epicharis, who was in
  despair what to say,&mdash;how could one break a thing of this sort?&mdash;he
  will grant you nothing, not even another day.' 'What do you mean?' said
  Octavia, for she did not yet understand. 'O lady,' she cried, 'these soldiers
  are come&mdash;' and she put into her look the meaning that she could not put
  into words. 'What!' cried the poor woman, her voice rising into a shrill
  scream, 'do you mean that they are come to kill me?' and she started up from
  her chair. Epicharis has told me that the sight of her face, ghastly pale,
  with the eyes wide open with fear, haunts her night and day. 'Oh, I cannot
  die! I cannot die!' she cried out. 'I am so young. Can't you hide me
  somewhere?' 'O dearest lady!' said Epicharis, 'I would die to save you. But
  there is no way. Only we can die together.' Then she took out of her robe two
  poniards, which she always carried about in case they should be wanted in
  this way. 'Let me show you. Strike just as you see me strike. After all it
  hurts very little, and it will all be over in a moment.' 'No, no, no!'
  screamed the unhappy lady, 'take the dreadful things away. I cannot bear to
  look at them. I will go and beg the soldiers to have mercy.' And she flew out
  of the room to where the Centurion was standing with his men in the hall. She
  threw herself at the man's feet&mdash;it was a most pitiable thing to see,
  Epicharis said when she told me the story&mdash;and begged for mercy. Poor
  thing, she clung to life, though the gods know she had had very little to
  make her love it. The Centurion was unmoved,&mdash;as for some of the common
  soldiers, they were half disposed to rebel,&mdash;and said nothing but,
  'Madam, I have my orders.' 'But the Emperor must have forgotten,' she cried
  out; 'I am not Empress now, I am only a poor widow, and almost his sister.'
  Then again, 'Oh, why does Agrippina let him do it?' seeming to forget in her
  terror that Agrippina was dead. After this had gone on for some time, the
  officer said to one of his men, 'Bind her, and put a gag in her mouth.'
  Epicharis saw one or two of the men put their hands to their swords when they
  heard the order given. But it was useless to think of resisting or
  disobeying. They bound her hand and foot, and gagged her, and then carried
  her into the house. They had brought a slave with them who knew some thing
  about surgery. This man opened the great artery in each arm, but somehow the
  blood did not flow. 'It is fairly frozen with fear,' Epicharis heard him say
  to the Centurion. Then the two whispered together, and after a while the men
  carried the poor woman into the bath-room. Epicharis was not allowed to go
  with her; but she heard that she was suffocated with the hot steam, and that,
  as far as any one knew, she never came to herself again. That, anyhow, is
  something to be thankful for."</p>

  <p>"They told a story in Rome," said Lateranus, "that the head was brought to
  Poppæa. Do you think that it is true? Did Epicharis ever say anything about
  it to you ?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Fannius; "she never knew what became of the body. She was
  never allowed to see it; it was burnt that night, she was told."</p>

  <p>"And so this is the true story of Octavia," said Subrius after a pause.
  "You remember, Lateranus, there was a great thanksgiving for the Emperor's
  deliverance from dangerous enemies, and the enemy was this poor girl. Why
  don't the gods, if they indeed exist (which I sometimes doubt), rain down
  their thunderbolts upon those who mock them with these blasphemous
  pretences?"</p>

  <p>"Verily," cried Lateranus, "if they had been so minded Rome would have
  been burnt up long ago. Have you not observed that we are particularly
  earnest in thanking heaven when some more than usually atrocious villainy has
  been perpetrated?"</p>

  <p>The gladiator looked with a continually increasing astonishment on the two
  men who used language of such unaccustomed freedom. Subrius thought it time
  to make another step in advance.</p>

  <p>"As you have taken us into your confidence," he said, "about the contents
  of your will, you will not mind my asking you a question about these
  matters."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," answered the man. "You need not be afraid of offending
  me."</p>

  <p>"If things go well with you, as there is every hope of their doing, and
  you get your discharge all right, what do you look forward to?"</p>

  <p>The gladiator shifted his position two or three times uneasily, and made
  what seemed an attempt to speak, but did not succeed in uttering a word.</p>

  <p>"If Epicharis does not become your legatee, as I sincerely hope she may
  not, is she to have no interest in your money?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, sir, she will make no promises, or rather, she talks so wildly that
  she might as well say nothing all."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I may trust you, gentlemen, for I am putting her life as well as my own
  in your hands?"</p>

  <p>"Speak on boldly. Surely we have both of us said enough this evening to
  bring our necks into danger, if you chose to inform against us. We are all
  sailing in the same ship."</p>

  <p>"It is true. I ought not to have doubted. Well, what she says to me is
  this, 'Avenge my dear mistress on those who murdered her, and then ask me
  what you please.' She won't hear of anything else. I have asked her what I
  could do, a simple gladiator, who has not even the power to go hither or
  thither as he pleases. She has only one answer, 'Avenge Octavia!' "</p>

  <p>"It is not so hopeless as you think. There many who hold that Octavia
  should be avenged, aye, and others besides Octavia. We are biding our time,
  and there are many things that seem to show that it is not far off. You will
  be with us then, Fannius?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said the gladiator. "I want to hear nothing more; the fewer
  names I know, the better, for then I cannot possibly betray them. Only give
  me the word, and I follow. But how about Epicharis?" he went on; "is she to
  hear anything?"</p>

  <p>"I don't like letting women into a secret," said Lateranus.</p>

  <p>"Nor I," said Subrius, "as a rule; but if there is any truth in faces,
  this particular woman will keep a secret and hold to a purpose better than
  most of us. Shall we leave it to Fannius' discretion?"</p>

  <p>To this Lateranus agreed.</p>

  <p>After some more conversation the gladiator rose to take his leave. A
  minute or so afterwards he returned to the room. "Gentlemen," he said, "there
  is a great fire to be seen from a window in the passage, and from what I can
  see it must be in the Circus, or, anyhow, very near it."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap05"
     name="chap05"></a>V. &mdash; A GREAT FIRE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE two friends hurried to the window. At the very moment of
  their reaching it a great flame shot up into the air. It was easy to
  distinguish by its light the outline of the Circus, the white polished marble
  of which shone like gold with the reflection of the blaze.</p>

  <p>"It can scarcely be the Circus itself that is on fire," cried Subrius;
  "the light seems to fall upon it from without. But the place must be
  dangerously near to it. Hurry back, Fannius, as quick as you can. We shall
  come after you as soon as possible, and shall look out for you at the
  Southeastern Gate."</p>

  <p>The gladiator ran off at the top of his speed, and the two friends lost no
  time in making themselves ready to follow him. Discarding the dress of
  ceremony in which they had sat down to dinner, for indeed, the folds of the
  toga were not a little encumbering, they both equipped themselves in
  something like the costume which they would have assumed for a hunting
  expedition, an outer and an inner tunic, drawers reaching to the knee,
  leggings and boots. Lateranus was by far the larger man of the two; but one
  of his freedmen was able to furnish the Prætorian with what he wanted.</p>

  <p>"Don't let us forget the hunting-knives," said Lateranus; "we may easily
  want something wherewith to defend ourselves, for a big fire draws to it all
  the villains in the city."</p>

  <p>By this time all Rome knew what was going on, and the friends, when they
  descended into the street, found themselves in the midst of a crowd that was
  eagerly hurrying towards the scene of action. A fire exercised the same
  fascination on the Roman public that it exercises to-day in London or Paris.
  No one allowed his dignity to stand in the way of his enjoying it; no one was
  so weak but that he made shift to be a spectator. Senators and Knights
  struggled for places with artisans and slaves; and of course, women brought
  their babies, as they have brought them from time immemorial on the most
  inconvenient and incongruous occasions.</p>

  <p>Arrived at the spot, the friends found that the conflagration was even
  more extensive and formidable than they had anticipated. The Circus was still
  untouched, but it was in imminent danger. A shop where oil for the Circus
  lamps had been sold was burning fiercely, and it was separated from the walls
  of the great building only by a narrow passage. As for the shop itself, there
  was no hope of saving it; the. flames had got such a mastery over it that had
  the Roman appliances for extinguishing fire been ten times more effective
  than they were, they could hardly have made any impression upon them. To keep
  the adjoining buildings wet with deluges of water was all that could be done.
  A more effective expedient would have been, of course, to pull them down.
  Subrius, who was a man of unusual energy and resource, actually proposed this
  plan of action to the officer in command of the Watch, a body of men who
  performed the functions of a fire-brigade. The suggestion was coldly
  received. The officer had received, he said, no orders, and could not take
  upon himself so much responsibility. And who was to compensate the owners, he
  asked. And indeed, the time had hardly come for the application of so extreme
  a remedy. As a matter of fact, it is always employed too late. Again and
  again enormous loss might be prevented if the vigorous measures which have to
  be employed at the last had been taken at the first. No one, indeed, could
  blame the Prefect of the Watch for his unwillingness to take upon himself so
  serious a responsibility, but the conduct of his subordinates was less
  excusable. They did nothing, or next to nothing, in checking the fire. More
  than this, they refused, and even repulsed with rudeness, the offers of
  assistance made by the bystanders. A cordon was formed to keep the spectators
  at a distance from the burning houses; for by this time the buildings on
  either side had caught fire. This would have been well enough, if it had been
  desired that the firemen should work unimpeded by the pressure of a curious
  mob; but, as far as could be seen, they did nothing themselves, and suffered
  nothing to be done by others.</p>

  <p>Subrius and Lateranus, though they were persons of too much distinction to
  be exposed to insult, found themselves unable to do any good. They were
  chafing under their forced inaction, when they were accosted by the
  gladiator.</p>

  <p>"Come, gentlemen," he said; "let us see what can be done. The fire has
  broken out in two fresh places, and this time inside the Circus."</p>

  <p>"In two places!" cried Subrius in astonishment. "That is an extraordinary
  piece of bad luck. Has the wind carried the flames there?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly, sir," replied the man, "for the night, you see, is fairly still,
  and both places, too, are at the other end of the building."</p>

  <p>"It seems that there is foul play somewhere," said Lateranus. "But come,
  we seem to be of no use here."</p>

  <p>The three started at full speed for the scene of the new disaster, Fannius
  leading the way. One of the fires, which had broken out in the quarters of
  the gladiators, had been extinguished by the united exertions of the corps.
  The other was spreading in an alarming way, all the more alarming because it
  threatened that quarter of the building in which the wild beasts were kept.
  The keeper of the Circus, who had, within the building, an authority
  independent of the Prefect of the Watch, exerted himself to the utmost in
  checking the progress of the flames, and was zealously seconded by his
  subordinates; but the buildings to be saved were unluckily of wood. The
  chambers and storehouses underneath the tiers of seats were of this material,
  and were besides, in many cases, filled with combustible substances. In a few
  minutes it became evident that the quarters of the beasts could not be saved.
  The creatures seemed themselves to have become conscious of the danger that
  threatened them, and the general confusion and alarm were heightened by the
  uproar which they made. The shrill trumpeting of the elephants and the deep
  roaring of the tigers and lions, with the various cries of the mixed
  multitude of smaller creatures, every sound being accentuated by an
  unmistakable note of fear, combined to make a din that was absolutely
  appalling. The situation, it will be readily understood, was perplexing in
  the extreme. The collection was of immense value, and how could it be
  removed? For a few of the animals that had recently arrived the movable cages
  in which they had been brought to the Circus were still available, for, as it
  happened, they had not yet been taken away. Others had of necessity to be
  killed; this seemed better than leaving them to perish in the flames, for
  they could not be removed, and it was out of the question to let them loose.
  This was done, to the immense grief of their keepers, for each beast had its
  own special attendant, a man who had been with it from its capture, and who
  was commonly able to control its movements. The poor fellows loudly protested
  that they would be responsible for the good behaviour of their charges, if
  they could be permitted to take them from their cages; but the Circus
  authorities could not venture to run the risk. An exception was made in the
  case of the elephants. These were released, for they could be trusted with
  their keepers. A part of the stock was saved&mdash;saved at least from the
  fire&mdash;by a happy thought that struck one of the officials of the Circus.
  A part of the arena had been made available for an exhibition of a kind that
  was always highly popular at Rome&mdash;a naval battle. This portion was on a
  lower level than the rest, and could be flooded at pleasure by turning on the
  water from a branch of one of the great aqueducts. This was now done, and a
  good many of the creatures were turned into the place to take their chance.
  They would at least suffer less from being drowned than from being burnt
  alive.</p>

  <p>Throughout the night Subrius and Lateranus exerted themselves to the
  utmost, and their efforts were ably seconded by the gladiator. The day was
  beginning to break when, utterly worn out by their labours, they returned to
  the house. Fannius was permitted by his master to accompany them. The man had
  contrived to collect his slave gladiators, with the exception of two who had
  perished in a drunken sleep. These he had removed to a house which he
  possessed in the suburbs, and which was commonly used as a sanatorium for the
  sick and wounded. Fannius, who, as a freeman, bound by his own voluntary act,
  and serving for purposes of his own, was not likely to run away, he allowed
  to accompany Lateranus to his home.</p>

  <p>They were not permitted to enjoy for long their well-earned repose. It was
  barely the second hour when a loud knocking at the outer gate roused the
  porter, who, having himself watched late on the preceding night, was fast
  asleep. Looking through the little opening which permitted him to take a
  preliminary survey of all applicants for admission, he saw an elderly slave,
  who, to judge from his breathless and dishevelled condition, had been engaged
  in a personal struggle.</p>

  <p>The slave was really an old acquaintance, but the porter was still stupid
  with sleep, and the newcomer was greatly changed in appearance from the neat
  and well-dressed figure with which the guardian of the door was familiar.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, and what do you want?" he asked in a surly tone. "The master
  can see no callers this morning; he was up late and is fast
  asleep,&mdash;though, indeed," he added in an undertone, "you do not look
  much like a caller."</p>

  <p>"Waste no time," cried the man; "I must see him, whether he be awake or
  asleep. It is a matter of life and death."</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens!" cried the porter, recognizing the voice; "is it you,
  Dromio? What in the world brings you here in such a plight?"</p>

  <p>"The furies seize you!" cried Dromio, shaking the gate in a fury of
  impatience; "why don't you open?"</p>

  <p>Thus adjured the porter undid the bar, calling at the same time to a slave
  in the inner part of the house, who was to take the visitor to Lateranus'
  apartment.</p>

  <p>"You must see the master, you say?" said the porter. "I don't like to wake
  him without necessity. He did not come back last night till past the middle
  of the fourth watch."</p>

  <p>"Must see him? Yes, indeed," cried Dromio. "The gods grant that I may not
  be too late."</p>

  <p>The other slave appeared at this moment. "Lead me to your master," said
  Dromio; "quick, quick!"</p>

  <p>Lateranus, roused from the deep sleep into which he had fallen, was at
  first almost as much perplexed as the porter had been.</p>

  <p>"Who is this?" he cried to the slave; "did you not understand that I would
  have no&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, my lord," cried Dromio, as he took one of Lateranus' hands and
  kissed it. "I come from the Lady Pomponia."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing wrong, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"Dreadfully wrong, I fear. The gods grant that she may be still
  alive!"</p>

  <p>"What has happened?"</p>

  <p>"Her house is attacked, and she begs your help. I will tell you the story
  afterwards, but I implore you, by all the gods, do not lose a moment!"</p>

  <p>Lateranus touched three times a hand-bell that stood by his side, at the
  same time springing from his couch on to the floor and beginning to dress.
  The summons of the bell, signifying as it did that the presence of the
  steward was required, soon brought that official to the chamber.</p>

  <p>"Arm the cohort at once," said Lateranus, "and send a runner to tell the
  Tribune Subrius that he is wanted."</p>

  <p>The "cohort" was not of course the regular military division known by that
  name, but a retinue of young freedmen and slaves who were regularly drilled
  in arms.</p>

  <p>"It shall be done, my lord," said the steward, saluting.</p>

  <p>"And now," said Lateranus, "while I am dressing tell me what it is all
  about."</p>

  <p>Dromio then told his story.</p>

  <p>"Rather more than an hour ago a man knocked at the door, and said that he
  wished to see the Lady Pomponia. You know my mistress' ways&mdash;what a
  number of strange pensioners she has. In her house it is impossible to be
  surprised at any visitor. Still there was something about this man that made
  the porter suspicious. One thing was that the fellow spoke with a strong
  Jewish accent, and many of the Jews have a very great hatred against the
  mistress. Anyhow the porter kept the door shut, and said that he must have
  the stranger's name and business. 'Lucian is my name,' said the man, 'and I
  bring a message from Clemens the Elder.' That, you know, is one of the
  priests whom my lady makes so much of. That seemed satisfactory, and the
  porter opened the gate. Then what does this fellow do but put his foot on the
  threshold so that the door should not be shut again, and whistles a signal to
  his companions, who, it seems, were in waiting round the next corner. Anyhow
  some five and twenty as ill-looking ruffians as you ever set eyes on came
  running up. By good luck the porter had his youngest son Geta sitting in the
  lodge, 'Help!' he cries, and Geta who is a regular Hercules, comes running
  out, seizes the first fellow by the throat and throws him out, deals just in
  the same fashion with a second, who was half over the threshold, and bangs to
  the gate. At that a regular howl of rage came from the party outside. 'Open,
  or we will burn the house down,' shouted their leader. Pomponia, by this
  time, had been roused by the uproar. She understood what was to be done in a
  moment; she always does; we sometimes say that she must have learned
  something of this art from the old General. 'Haste, Dromio,' she said to me,
  'by the back way, before they surround the house, and tell Lateranus that I
  want his help.'"</p>

  <p>"That she shall have as quick as I can give it," said Lateranus; "but
  where are the Watch? Are houses to be besieged in Rome as if it were a city
  taken by storm?"</p>

  <p>"My lord," answered Dromio, "that is just what Rome seems to be. The Watch
  are fairly dazed, I think, by this dreadful fire, which is growing worse
  every hour, and if we waited for them to help us we should certainly all have
  our throats cut in the meanwhile."</p>

  <p>At this moment the steward entered the room. "The cohort is ready," he
  said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap06"
     name="chap06"></a>VI. &mdash; BAFFLED</h2>

  <p class="first">THE company which Lateranus called his "cohort" consisted of
  about thirty men, divided into three guards, as we may call them, of ten.
  They were armed after the fashion of the "gowned" or civilian cohort of the
  Prætorians, which was accustomed to keep guard in the Emperor's palace; that
  is, they had neither helmet or shield or pike, but carried swords and lances.
  Even these arms they never wore except within the precincts of the house, and
  then only when they were being drilled and practised in sword play and other
  military exercises. Lateranus always spoke of the cohort as a plaything of
  his own which had no serious purpose, and it may readily be understood that
  he was careful not to make any display of it. Any master was at liberty to
  put weapons into the hands of his dependents in an emergency. The only
  difference was that these dependents had been trained to use these weapons
  skilfully and in concert. And now the emergency was come which was to put
  their utility to a practical test. One of the guards of ten was left to
  protect the house. Lateranus, who was apparently unarmed, but carried a short
  sword underneath his outer tunic, proceeded with the other two at the
  "double" to the scene of action.</p>

  <p>The relieving force was not a moment too soon in arriving. The outer gates
  of the mansion had been forced open, and the assailants were applying
  crowbars to the door which led to the private apartments of Pomponia. This,
  indeed, had given way; naturally it had not been made strong enough to resist
  a violent assault; but the domestics within had piled up a quantity of heavy
  furniture which had to be removed before the besiegers could make good their
  entrance. This obstacle saved the house. Before it could be got rid of, the
  relieving party arrived, and took the assailants in the rear. The leader of
  the latter at once recognized that his purpose had been defeated, and
  desisted from his attempt without challenging a struggle with the new
  arrivals. His bearing, however, was curiously unlike what might have been
  expected from the ringleader of a lawless gang surprised by a superior force.
  So far from displaying any embarrassment, he appeared to be perfectly at his
  ease, and accosted Lateranus with all the air of an equal.</p>

  <p>"You have been beforehand with me this time, sir," he said in a quiet
  tone, which nevertheless was full of suppressed fury. "I shall not forget
  it."</p>

  <p>Lateranus smiled.</p>

  <p>"Neither will they for whom I act," went on the other, "and that you will
  find no laughing matter."</p>

  <p>"I shall always be ready to answer for myself," said Lateranus firmly.
  "Since when has your mistress taken it upon herself to send storming parties
  against the houses of innocent citizens?"</p>

  <p>To this the man made no reply. "You will not hinder our departure," he
  went on after a pause. "You will find it better not to do so."</p>

  <p>Lateranus shrugged his shoulders. "You can go," he said; "it is not my
  business to do the duty of the guards, but if there is any justice in Rome,
  you shall hear of this again."</p>

  <p>"Justice!" cried the fellow with an insolent laugh; "we know something
  much better than that."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the cohort had been waiting with eagerness for the end of the
  colloquy. All had their hands on the hilt of their swords, and all were ready
  to use them. Profound was their disappointment when, instead of the expected
  order to draw, came the command to stand at ease. One by one the assailants
  filed out of the court, their leader being the last to leave the place.</p>

  <p>"What ails the master?" said one of the younger men, in an angry whisper
  to his neighbour.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" replied the man addressed. "Don't you see that it is
  Theodectes?"</p>

  <p>"Theodectes!" said the other; "who is Theodectes?"</p>

  <p>"The favourite freedman of Poppæa. Is not that enough for you?"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Lateranus, leaving instructions that the cohort should remain
  for the present in the court, made his way to the apartment where Pomponia
  was awaiting him.</p>

  <p>"Welcome!" she said, coming forward and taking his hand with a peculiarly
  gracious smile; "the Lord has sent you in good time."</p>

  <p>Pomponia Græcina, to give the lady her full name, was a woman of
  singularly dignified presence. She was now not far from her seventieth year,
  and her abundant hair, which, contrary to the fashion of the ladies of her
  time, she wore with a severe plainness, was of a silvery whiteness. But her
  figure was erect; her complexion retained no little of the bloom of
  youth,&mdash;a bloom which, again in opposition to contemporary custom, owed
  nothing to the resources of art; and her eyes could flash, on occasion, with
  a fire which years had done nothing to quench. Her history was one of
  singular interest. She came of a house not originally noble, but
  distinguished by having produced many eminent citizens and soldiers. Perhaps
  the most famous of these had been Pomponius Atticus, the friend and
  correspondent of Cicero. Atticus, to speak of him by the name by which he is
  commonly known, had played with extraordinary skill the part of an honest man
  who desires to be on good terms with all parties at once. He had been so
  loyal to the vanquished Republicans, that Cicero, till very near the time of
  his death, kept up an affectionate correspondence with him; and was yet so
  friendly with the victorious Imperialists that his daughter married the chief
  friend of Augustus, and his granddaughter became the wife of Tiberius. These
  great alliances did not result in happiness to his descendants, for one of
  the last of his race, Julia, the granddaughter of Tiberius, was put to death
  by the Emperor Claudius, prompted by his wicked wife Messalina. Julia's death
  was a lasting grief to her kinswoman, the Pomponia of my story. Never
  afterwards could she bear to mix in the brilliant society of the Imperial
  Court. But there was another reason why she held herself aloof from the
  fashionable world of Rome. She had come, how it is impossible to say, under
  the influence of some early preacher of the Christian faith; and a Christian
  woman, when the life of the court was such as we know it to have been in the
  days of Claudius and Nero, had no alternative but to live in retirement. So
  marked was her attitude that it excited suspicion; and she was actually
  accused&mdash;on what grounds we cannot say, possibly on the testimony of
  some member of her household&mdash;of being addicted to a superstition not
  recognized by Roman law. With a woman of ordinary rank it might have gone
  hard, but Pomponia had a powerful protector in her husband. He was one of the
  most distinguished soldiers of Rome, and was, happily for himself, too old to
  excite the jealous fears of the Emperor. When he made it a matter of personal
  favour that in the case of his wife an ancient practice should be revived,
  and that he as her husband should be constituted her judge, his request was
  granted. That he himself shared her faith we can hardly suppose, but he had
  seen its results in the blamelessness of her life, and the trial held by a
  family council, over which he himself presided, ended, as was doubtless his
  wish, in the acquittal of the accused. Since that time she had lived
  unmolested, though, as we have seen, she had enemies.</p>

  <p>Pomponia went on: "Here is some one else who has to thank you for your
  timely aid. I will present you to her."</p>

  <p>She drew aside as she spoke the curtains that hung over an arch leading
  into a smaller apartment. Into this she disappeared for a moment, and then
  returned leading by the hand a girl who may have numbered some eighteen
  summers.</p>

  <p>"Claudia," she said, "this is Plautius Lateranus, my husband's nephew,
  whom we are to have for our Consul next year, and who meanwhile has delivered
  us from a very great danger. And this," she went on, turning to Lateranus,
  "is Claudia, whom I venture to call my daughter, as indeed she is, though not
  after the flesh."</p>

  <p>The Roman, though he had known all the beauties of the Imperial Court for
  more than twenty years, was fairly surprised by the loveliness of the girl, a
  loveliness that was all the more startling because it was in some respect so
  different from that which he had been accustomed to admire in Italian maids
  and matrons. Her eyes, as far as he could see them, for they were bent
  downwards under their long lashes, were of a deep sapphire blue, the eyebrows
  exquisitely pencilled, the forehead somewhat broader and higher than agreed
  with the commonly accepted canons of taste, but of a noble outline, and full,
  it seemed, of intelligence. The nose was slightly retroussé, but this
  departure from the straight line of the Greek and the acquiline curve of the
  Roman feature seemed to give the face a peculiar piquancy; the lips were full
  and red; the complexion, while exquisitely clear, had none of the pallor
  which comes from the indoor habit of life. Claudia had never been afraid of
  the sun and the wind, and they had dealt kindly with her, neither freckling
  nor tanning her face, but giving it an exquisite hue of health. Her hair, of
  glossy chestnut hue, was not confined in the knot which Roman fashion had
  borrowed from the art of Greece, but fell in long curling locks on her
  shoulders. Lateranus bowed over the girl's hand, and carried it to his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"I greet you, fair cousin," he said with an admiring glance, "for if my
  aunt, who always speaks the truth, calls you daughter, my cousin you must
  needs be."</p>

  <p>Claudia muttered a few words that probably were meant for thanks. They did
  not catch the listener's ear, though he noticed that they were spoken with
  the hesitation of one who was using an unfamiliar language. Then the colour
  which had covered the girl's cheek, as she came forward, with a brilliant
  flush, faded as suddenly. She cast an imploring look, as if asking for help,
  on the elder lady.</p>

  <p>"Ah! my child," cried Pomponia, "you suffer. I have lived so long alone
  that I have grown thoughtless and selfish, or I should have known that you
  wanted rest after all that you have gone through. Sit you here till I can
  call Chloris." And she made the girl sit in the chair from which she had
  herself risen, while she pressed a hand-bell that stood on a table close
  by.</p>

  <p>A Greek waiting-maid speedily appeared in answer to the summons.</p>

  <p>"Have the litter brought hither," said Pomponia, "and carry the Lady
  Claudia to her room."</p>

  <p>"Nay, mother," said the girl, "I should be ashamed to give so much
  trouble, and indeed, I do not want the litter. I will go to my room indeed,
  but it will be enough if Chloris will give me her arm."</p>

  <p>"You are sure?" said the elder lady. "I have seen so little of young
  people of late years that I am at a loss."</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed, mother, quite sure," and she withdrew, supporting herself by
  the attendant's arm, but more in show than in reality, for indeed the
  faintness, quite a new sensation to Claudia's vigorous health, had quite
  passed away,</p>

  <p>"My dear aunt," said Lateranus, when the girl had left the room, "this is
  indeed a surprise. From what quarter of the world have you imported this
  marvellous beauty? That she is not Latin or Greek I saw at a glance, and I
  have been puzzling my brain ever since to find out to what nation she
  belongs. Is she Gaul, or perhaps German?"</p>

  <p>"Nay," replied Pomponia; "you must go further than Gaul or even
  Germany."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Lateranus after reflecting for a minute or two. "By all the
  gods!&mdash;pardon me, aunt," he went on, seeing a shadow pass over his
  aunt's gentle face,&mdash;"I had forgotten. Verily, I have it! She must be
  British!"</p>

  <p>"Now you are right."</p>

  <p>"And how long has she been with you? I heard nothing of her when I was
  last here."</p>

  <p>"A month only. Her coming, indeed, was quite unexpected, and to be quite
  candid, at first unwelcome. You know my way of life. I had grown so
  accustomed to being alone that I almost dreaded the sight of a new face."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Lateranus, "a face like that need hardly frighten you."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you think her beautiful?" cried Pomponia, her face lighted up with
  one of her rare smiles. "And don't you see just a little likeness to my
  dearest Julia?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; there is certainly a likeness, especially about the eyes."</p>

  <p>"As soon as I saw that, I began to love her; and indeed I soon found that
  she is worth loving for her own sake. And there is another reason, too, which
  I fear, my dear nephew, you will not understand."</p>

  <p>"Ah! I see; she is of the same sect, I suppose. It has reached to Britain
  itself then. Wonderful!"</p>

  <p>"Wonderful indeed, and more than wonderful if it were what you call it, a
  sect. Oh, dear Aulus, if you would but listen!"</p>

  <p>"All in good time, dear aunt, perhaps when my Consulship is over. It would
  certainly be awkward if you made a proselyte of me before."</p>

  <p>"In good time, dear Aulus! Nay, there is no time so good as this. Who
  knows what may happen before your Consulship is over?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay, dear aunt; good words, good words! But tell me, who is this
  lovely Claudia?"</p>

  <p>"You have heard your uncle speak of King Cogidumnus?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember the name. He lived somewhere, if I remember right, on the
  edge of the great southern forest, of which my uncle used to tell such
  wonders."</p>

  <p>"Just so; he was the King of the Regni. Indeed, he is living still. Well,
  the King took our side. Claudius made him a Roman citizen, and allowed him to
  assume his own names, so that he is a Tiberius Claudius; and also enlarged
  his kingdom with some of the country which your uncle conquered."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember now hearing about it from my friend Pudens. He was
  wrecked on the coast in one of those terrible storms that they have out
  there, and made his way to the chief town of the Regni. He found it, he told
  me, quite a little Rome, with a Senate, and a Forum, and baths, and a
  library, and I know not what besides. The King himself was quite a polished
  gentleman, spoke Latin admirably and even could quote Virgil and Horace. No
  one, to look at him, would have thought, so my friend Pudens used to say,
  that ten years before he had been running wild in the woods with very little
  on besides a few stripes of blue paint."</p>

  <p>"Well," resumed Pomponia, "Claudia is his daughter."</p>

  <p>"You astonish me more and more," cried Lateranus. "And pray, what brings
  her to Rome?"</p>

  <p>"A prince who pays tribute to Rome in Britain can hardly feel quite safe.
  His countrymen are sure to hate him, and I am afraid that we who are his
  allies do not always treat him as we should. Claudia's father had a terrible
  fright three years ago, when Boadicea and the Iceni rebelled. His city would
  have been the next to be attacked after London, if Paulinus had not come up
  in time to stop them. London, you must know, is scarcely more than seventy
  miles off, and the Britons don't take much time over seventy miles. The King
  had everything ready to embark,&mdash;you see he has the advantage of being
  near the sea,&mdash;his wife, who is since dead, and Claudia, who is his only
  child, were actually on board a galley with the best part of his treasure. If
  the news had been bad instead of good, they would have sailed at once.
  Lately, it seems, he has been getting anxious again, and though he loves his
  daughter dearly,&mdash;the poor girl cannot speak of him without
  tears,&mdash;he felt that he should be much happier if she were safe. Then
  the death of the mother, who was an admirable woman, decided him. His nearest
  kinswomen are not people into whose charge he would like to put his daughter.
  So he sent her here, appealing to me on the score of his old friendship with
  my husband. I could not refuse, though I must confess that the idea was very
  distasteful to me. What should I do, I thought, with a young barbarian in my
  house? It was a wicked idea, even if it had been true, which it certainly is
  not. Who am I," she added in a low voice which she did not mean to reach her
  nephew's ears, "Who am I, that I should call aught that He has made common or
  unclean? In Him there is 'neither barbarian, Scythian, bond, nor free.' "</p>

  <p>"You interest me greatly in your Claudia. But, my dear aunt, we have to
  consider the future, both for you and her. You know, of course, who is at the
  bottom of this business."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know&mdash;Poppæa."</p>

  <p>"But tell me, for I confess it puzzles me, why does Poppæa hate you? That
  she will spare no one who stands in the way of her pleasure or her ambition I
  understand; but you, how do you interfere with her?"</p>

  <p>"Listen, Aulus. Poppæa has another thing that she cares for besides
  pleasure and power, and that is what she calls her religion."</p>

  <p>"But I thought&mdash;pardon me for mentioning such a creature in the same
  breath with you&mdash;I thought that you and she were of somewhat the same
  way of thinking in this matter."</p>

  <p>"It was natural that you should. Most people who know anything at all
  about such things have the same notion. But it is not so. Briefly, the truth
  is this. The religion to which Poppæa inclines is the religion of the Jews;
  the faith to which, by God's mercy, I have been brought, rose up among the
  same nation. A Jew first gave it to men; Jews have preached it since. But
  those who still walk in the old ways hate them that follow the new, hate them
  worse than they hate the heathen. Poppæa, poor creature, knows nothing about
  such matters, but the men to whom she goes for counsel, the men who she hopes
  will find a way for her to go on sinning and yet escape the punishment of
  sin, the men who take her gifts for themselves and their temple, and pay for
  them with smooth words, they know well enough the difference between
  themselves and us; it is they who stir her up; it is they who have told her
  to make a first victim of me."</p>

  <p>"I understand, at least in part, but what you say only makes me feel more
  anxious. What will you do? She has been baffled this time; but she won't take
  her defeat. If I am not mistaken, there is going to be a dreadful time in
  Rome when the law will be powerless; and I may not be able to protect
  you."</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, a slave knocked at the door of the apartment.
  Bidden to enter, he ushered in Subrius the Prætorian and a friend.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap07"
     name="chap07"></a>VII. &mdash; FLIGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">"LET me present to you my friend Subrius, a Tribune of the
  Prætorians," said Lateranus, addressing Pomponia. "I sent for him as soon as
  your message reached me."</p>

  <p>"You are very good in coming so readily to help a stranger," said Pomponia
  with a gracious smile.</p>

  <p>"I do not think of the Lady Pomponia as a stranger," replied the Tribune.
  "I had the honour of serving my first campaign under her husband. Allow me,
  in my turn, to present to you my friend and kinsman, Marcus Annius Pudens. He
  has just returned on furlough from the Euphrates, and is staying with me in
  camp."</p>

  <p>"I thank you, too, sir," said Pomponia. "It is very pleasant to find that
  one has so many friends."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Lateranus, "you are come in time. Just now we don't want your
  swords, but we certainly want your counsel. Have I your permission," he went
  on, addressing himself to Pomponia, "to put the whole state of the case
  before these gentlemen?"</p>

  <p>Pomponia signified her assent.</p>

  <p>"Matters then stand thus. For reasons which it is needless at present to
  explain, the Lady Pomponia has incurred the enmity of Poppæa. I recognized
  the Empress' most trusted freedman as the leader of the attack which I had
  the good fortune to be able to repulse. If I know anything of her and him
  they won't accept defeat. The question is, what is to be done? What say you,
  Subrius?"</p>

  <p>The Tribune considered awhile. "It is quite clear that Poppæa and her
  agent are taking advantage of an exceptional time. Commonly, even she would
  not have ventured so far. Men have not forgotten what Aulus Plautius did for
  Rome, and his widow could not have been murdered with impunity. But the city
  is now in an extraordinary state. Law is absolutely suspended. The Watch
  seems to have received instructions to do nothing, or even worse than
  nothing. I am convinced that this fire is not an accident; or, if it was so
  in the beginning, it is not in the extent to which it has reached. I am
  positive that this morning, as I was making my way to the camp, I saw a
  scoundrel throw a lighted torch through the window of a house. I seized the
  fellow; but his companions rescued him, and when I called for help to a squad
  of the Watch that happened to be close by, they stood still and did
  nothing."</p>

  <p>"A big fire," remarked Pudens, "gives a fine opportunity for thieves, and
  they naturally make the best of it."</p>

  <p>"True," replied the Tribune; "but why do the Watch behave as if they were
  in league with them? Did not the same thing strike you last night,
  Lateranus?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Lateranus. "At first I thought that they were simply dazed by
  the magnitude of the disaster; afterwards I could not help seeing that they
  were deliberately increasing it."</p>

  <p>"Well, then," resumed Subrius, "to come to the point that immediately
  concerns us. We have to reckon with an exceptional state of things. For the
  present, as I said, law is suspended. We can't reckon on the guardians of the
  peace; nor, so occupied is every one with saving themselves or their
  property, on the help of the public. And supposing that this house catches
  fire, what then? Just now it is not in danger; but who can tell what may
  happen? The wind may change, and then the flames might be down upon it in an
  hour. Or it may be deliberately set on fire. That, if I can trust my own
  eyes, is being done elsewhere. What would happen then? Depend upon it, Poppæa
  and the villains that do her bidding will be watching their opportunity, and
  what a terrible chance they would have of working their will amidst all the
  confusion of a burning house. That is my view of the situation."</p>

  <p>"What, then, would you advise?" asked Pomponia in a tone that betrayed no
  agitation or alarm.</p>

  <p>"I should say&mdash;seek some safer place," replied Subrius.</p>

  <p>"For myself," said Pomponia after a pause, "I should be disposed to stay
  where I am."</p>

  <p>"But, dearest aunt," cried Lateranus, "if what Subrius says is true, and I
  do not doubt for an instant that it is, that means certain death."</p>

  <p>"And if it does, dear Aulus," replied Pomponia, "that does not seem so
  dreadful to me."</p>

  <p>"But there are others," said Lateranus.</p>

  <p>"You are right," Pomponia answered after a few minutes' reflection; "there
  are others. I should like, if it will not offend you, gentlemen, to ask for
  the counsel of one whom I greatly trust."</p>

  <p>She pressed her hand-bell, and when the attendant appeared, said to him,
  "I would speak with Phlegon, if he is at leisure."</p>

  <p>In the course of a short time, Phlegon, a Greek freedman, who was the
  superintendent of Pomponia's household, made his appearance. He was a man of
  singularly venerable appearance, nearly eighty years of age, but hale and
  vigorous.</p>

  <p>"Phlegon," said Pomponia, "these gentlemen are agreed that if we stay here
  our lives are not safe, and they counsel us to flee. What say you? My feeling
  is for staying. Are we not ready? Have we not been living for twenty years
  past as if this might come any day? And does not the holy Paul say in that
  letter of which Clemens of Philippi sent us a copy the other day, 'I have a
  desire to depart and be with Christ'?"</p>

  <p>"True, lady," said Phlegon; "but he goes on, if I remember right, 'But to
  abide in the flesh is more needful for you.' And you have others to think of,
  as he had. And did not the Master Himself say, 'When they persecute you in
  one city, flee ye to another'?"</p>

  <p>"You are right, as usual, Phlegon," said Pomponia. "I will go; but
  whither? As you know, nephew," she went on, turning to Aulus, "I have sold
  all my country houses, as my husband's will directed me, except, indeed, the
  one at Antium."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Lateranus, "it would hardly do for you to have Poppæa for a
  neighbour. But all my villas are at your disposal. There is one at Tibur;
  indeed, two at Tibur; only the second is but a poor place; one at Baiæ,
  another at Misenum, three at the Lake of Comum, one on Benacus,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Subrius, laughing, "you never are able to go through the list
  of your country houses without stumbling. But I have an idea of my own for
  which I venture to think something may be said. There is a place belonging to
  me near Gabii. It can hardly be called a country house, it is so small, but
  it has, for the present purpose, some advantages. In the first place, it is
  very much out of the way; and in the second, it is very strong. In fact, it
  is an old fortress, dating back, I have been told by people who are learned
  in these matters, from the time of the Kings. It has a deep moat all round
  it, crossed only by a single bridge which can be removed at pleasure, and the
  walls are high and strong. In short, it is a place that would stand a siege,
  if need be. Anyhow, it is safe against a surprise. If the Lady Pomponia can
  put up with a very poor place and mean accommodation, the house, such as it
  is, is entirely at her service."</p>

  <p>"An admirable plan!" cried Lateranus. "What say you, my dear aunt? I know
  that you do not set much store on outward things."</p>

  <p>"No, indeed, I do not," replied Pomponia. "The offer of the Tribune
  Subrius I most gladly accept, but how to thank him sufficiently I do not
  know."</p>

  <p>"There is no need of thanks, lady," said Subrius. "I owe everything to
  Aulus Plautius, who made a soldier of me when I might have been&mdash;I am
  not ashamed to own it&mdash;a poltroon. Do what I may, I shall never repay
  the debt."</p>

  <p>"And when shall we start?" asked Pomponia.</p>

  <p>"At once, to-night, I would suggest," answered Subrius. "The moon is
  nearly full, and you will barely reach my house before it sets."</p>

  <p>Arrangements were made accordingly for a start that evening. Subrius would
  not be able to accompany them, for he had to be on duty in the camp, and
  thought it as well not to ask for leave of absence. His place was to be taken
  by his friend Pudens, an arrangement which would have its advantages, as the
  person of Pudens would not be known. For the same reason Lateranus, one of
  the best known, as he was one of the most popular men in Rome, determined to
  absent himself. But he furnished the two litters with their bearers, which
  were to convey Pomponia and Claudia, each with a single female attendant, and
  he also sent, by way of guard, the same detachment of his cohort which he had
  brought to the relief of the house in the morning. Pomponia's establishment,
  it should be said, was on the smallest scale, not because she was either poor
  or parsimonious, but because her great wealth was devoted to the benevolence
  which her faith was already beginning to make a new factor in human life.</p>

  <p>Punctually at sunset the party started. The route chosen was naturally
  that which took them by the shortest way out of the city. But, small as was
  the space which they traversed, the sights which they encountered were
  harrowing in the extreme. The fire itself, in its active force, had passed
  elsewhere, but it had left behind it a hideous scene of desolation. Some of
  the larger buildings were still burning, sending up huge volumes of smoke,
  out of which a tongue of flame would now and then shoot forth. In some places
  the blackened walls stood erect, with a ghastly semblance of the human
  habitation which they had once contained; in others everything had fallen
  prostrate in undistinguishable confusion on the ground. Here and there an
  arch or portico tottered to its fall in a way that threatened the passer-by
  with instant destruction. Sometimes the traveller could see the pathetic
  remnant of a ruined home which by some strange chance the flames had spared,
  a hearth with the chairs still standing about it, a table spread with the
  remnants of a meal, a picture on a wall, a draught- board left just as the
  players had started up from it in their alarm, a harp, a baby's cradle. Now
  and then they came across the corpse of some unhappy inmate who had been
  struck by a falling stone, or half buried under some huge beam. There had not
  been time to remove these ghastly remains, or the calamity was so
  overpowering that men had lost their respect for the remains of the
  dead,&mdash;always one of the worst signs of a general despair. In many
  places poor creatures who had lost their all were groping among the yet
  smoking ruins for any possession of a more durable kind that might have
  survived or escaped the ravages of the flames. Elsewhere, sufferers too
  broken by their loss to make any effort, sat by the smouldering remains of
  what had once been a happy home, in a mute and tearless despair. Outside the
  walls, the scene, though deplorable enough, was yet diversified with a more
  cheerful element. Groups of people, surrounded many of them by a strange and
  incongruous medley of possessions which they had contrived to rescue from the
  flames, were camping out round fires which they had lighted. Many were
  cooking their evening meal; some were staring motionless into the flames; not
  a few, with the irrepressible gayety of a southern nature, were singing merry
  songs or joining in some uproarious chorus.</p>

  <p>The sight of all this distress so affected the compassionate heart of
  Pomponia that she could scarcely be induced to pass on. It was not, indeed,
  till she had exhausted all the stock of money that she had brought with her,
  in relieving what seemed the most urgent cases of need, that she could be
  persuaded to continue her journey. It was, perhaps, well for her comfort that
  Phlegon, who was more prudent, though not less kindly than his mistress, made
  a point of keeping a secret store, which he produced when everything seemed
  exhausted. On this occasion, when banking, in common with all other business
  was suspended, this resource was found particularly useful.</p>

  <p>The party had left Rome and its environs some way behind them, when a turn
  of the road brought them into a full view of the quarter where the
  conflagration was then raging most furiously. The twilight had now passed,
  and the moon was low in the heavens, so that the darkness brought the awful
  spectacle into more prominent relief.</p>

  <p>"Oh, mother!" cried Claudia, who had begun to use this endearing name to
  the elder lady, "do you think that this is the end of the world that is
  come?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, my daughter; there is much to happen before that can be."</p>

  <p>"But is Rome, think you, to be destroyed? Did not the holy Clement say
  something to this purpose the other day? Did he not speak&mdash;you know that
  I know very little of these things&mdash;of cities that had been destroyed
  for their wickedness? Is not Rome very wicked?"</p>

  <p>"Truly, my daughter; yet the Lord hath much people there, and will have
  more before the end shall come."</p>

  <p>Both felt it to be a relief when another turn of the road hid again the
  terrible spectacle. Both turned their eyes southward, where the stars were
  beginning to come out in the dark purple depths of the summer night. Another
  half-hour's journey brought them without further adventure to their journey's
  end.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap08"
     name="chap08"></a>VIII. &mdash; PUDENS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE young soldier whom Subrius had put in charge of the
  party had fulfilled his office with a punctilious observance of his military
  duty. There was probably little or no danger to be apprehended after the
  party had once got beyond the precincts of Rome, but Pudens did not on that
  account relax his watchful attention to his task. During one of the halts,
  when Pomponia appealed to his help in distributing her charities to the
  sufferers from the fire, he had caught a glimpse of one of the occupants of
  the other litter; but, though this glimpse had greatly excited his curiosity,
  he did not suffer himself to indulge it. Always in the front or the rear of
  the party, according as the nature of the route seemed to suggest, he
  conducted the little company with as much precaution as if it was traversing
  an enemy's country. But his thoughts were busy with Pomponia's unknown
  companion. He was tormented, one might almost say, with that tantalizing
  experience which is familiar to most of us, when the recollection of a face,
  name, or a word seems ever to be within our grasp, and yet ever eludes us.
  And, all the time, he was conscious of a strange feeling that the matter was
  one of supreme importance to him, one, in fact, which might change the whole
  tenour of his life. It is no wonder then that he looked forward with
  impatience to the termination of the journey when he would have, he hoped, a
  chance of satisfying his curiosity.</p>

  <p>His hopes were not disappointed. The ladies indeed were helped out of the
  litters by their own attendants, and he felt that it would have been an
  intrusion for him to come forward; still it was natural that he should be
  near, and chance favoured him with a full view of the unknown traveller. Just
  as the younger woman stepped from her litter, the moon shone through the
  clouds that had obscured it during the latter part of the journey, and fell
  full upon her face, and on a lock of long, light-coloured hair that had
  escaped from its fastening, and fallen upon her shoulder. In an instant his
  mind was illuminated with a flash of recognition and recollection. If
  confirmation had been wanted, it would have been supplied by the tone of her
  voice, as she chanced to address to Pomponia a few words expressive of
  delight at the safe termination of their journey.</p>

  <p>"Great Jupiter!" said Pudens to himself, "it is Claudia!"</p>

  <p>In the surprise of the moment the words were spoken half aloud. The girl,
  catching the sound of her name, and equally taken by surprise, half turned,
  but recollected herself before the action was completed. But the gesture
  showed outlines of figure and a pose that were familiar to the young man, as
  he stood, himself almost invisible in the shadow, eagerly watching the
  scene.</p>

  <p>It is now time for me to explain to my readers who Pudens was, and how he
  came to have made acquaintance with the Princess from Britain.</p>

  <p>Annius Pudens was the son of a man who had the reputation of being the
  very richest member of the wealthiest class in Rome, the knights. The elder
  Pudens had made his immense fortune by farming the public revenue and by
  money- lending. It would not have been well to inquire too closely into the
  methods by which it was accumulated. Some of his rivals used to say&mdash;the
  remark may of course have been suggested by the jealousy of trade&mdash;that
  his contracts were often obtained on remarkably easy terms, and from
  officials who had themselves been treated with equal consideration by the
  contractor in other matters. But nothing was ever proved, or, indeed,
  attempted to be proved. The loans Pudens had the prudence to make a long way
  from Rome. The rate of interest was higher in the provinces than in the
  capital, and the recovery of a debt could be effected without making any
  unpleasant disturbance. The small tributary kings, who were permitted by the
  good pleasure of Rome to keep up a shadowy sovereignty in some of the regions
  of the East, were among Pudens' best clients. Thirty, forty, even fifty per
  cent was not too much for these potentates to pay when some caprice of the
  moment was to be gratified. Rulers who have lost the realities of power
  commonly think more of its indulgences, and they emptied their treasuries to
  secure a beautiful slave, a fine singer or musician, or a jewel of unusual
  size. Pudens had always the gift of knowing exactly how far he could go. This
  knowledge, and the fact that his claims would be backed up by Roman arms,
  insured him against loss. The general result of his operations, public and
  private, was, as has been said, the acquisition of an enormous fortune.</p>

  <p>The elder Pudens had one great object always before him, and this was to
  give his son all that was desirable in life; one, I say, because this was
  really the motive of that devotion to money-making, which was commonly
  believed to be his ruling passion. For this son, an only child, left
  motherless in early infancy, nothing was too good, nothing too costly.
  Unfortunately, the father, who was a man of limited intelligence and feeble
  judgment, except in the one matter of money-making, set about securing his
  object in the very worst fashion imaginable. He knew that money can do much,
  and he imagined that it can do everything. He believed that he could furnish
  his child with all that he ought to have if he only paid enough for it.
  Himself a man of frugal and even parsimonious habits,&mdash;the common
  pleasures of life had no attractions for him,&mdash;he gave the child the
  very costliest establishment that could be purchased for money. For the
  nurses who attended to his wants when he was an infant, the slaves who waited
  on him in his boyhood, he gave the highest possible prices, and thought that
  in giving them he was necessarily securing the best of service. And he had,
  it must be owned, some ill luck in efforts that were really well meant. A
  friend had told him that slaves were not to be trusted, and he put a lady of
  respectable family over his son's establishment. Unfortunately, she was a
  selfish, unprincipled woman, whose only object was to make a purse for
  herself and to secure an easy life by indulging her young charge. A still
  more fatal mistake was the choice of a tutor. A smooth-tongued Greek, who
  concealed under a benign and even venerable exterior almost every vice of
  which humanity is capable, palmed himself off upon the credulous father, and
  was installed as the "guide, philosopher, and friend" of the unlucky son.</p>

  <p>Happily for himself, the younger Pudens had a nature that refused to be
  entirely spoiled. He had an innate refinement that shrunk from the worst
  excesses, a kindly and unselfish temper that kept his heart from being
  utterly hardened by indulgences, a taste for sport and athletics that gave
  him plenty of harmless and healthy employment, and a love of letters which
  commonly secured for study some part of his days and nights.</p>

  <p>Still he was on the high road to ruin, when, just as he was entering on
  his nineteenth year, he lost his father. Happily, the elder Pudens, in
  appointing a guardian for his son, had for once made a wise choice. He had
  asked Subrius, who was a distant kinsman, to accept the office, and the
  Prætorian had consented, little thinking that he should ever be called upon
  to act, for indeed the testator was little older than himself. When he found
  that his guardianship had become an actual responsibility, he acted with
  vigour. He seized the opportunity when the son was under the softening
  impression of his recent loss, and used it with the very best effect. He
  avoided anything like rebuke, but appealed to the young man's pride and to
  his adventurous spirit, as well as to the momentary disgust at his useless
  and discreditable existence which had come over him. Active service as a
  soldier was the remedy which Subrius prescribed, and, if the expression may
  be allowed, lost no time in administering. Almost before the young Pudens
  could reflect, he was on his way to join as a volunteer the army of Britain,
  then under the command of one of the most distinguished generals of the time,
  Suetonius Paulinus.</p>

  <p>His career was very near being cut short before he reached his
  destination. The galley which was to convey him from Gaul to the port of
  Regnum encountered a violent gale from the southwest on its way, was driven
  on to the Needles, then, as now, one of the most dangerous spots on the
  southern coast, and dashed in pieces. The only survivors of the wreck were
  Pudens and two young sailors. He owed his life to his vigorous frame and to
  his power of swimming; powers well known on the Campus, where he had been
  accustomed to distance all competitors, sometimes crossing the Tiber as many
  as ten times. He struggled to one of the little bays of beach which were to
  be found at the foot of the cliffs of Vectis, contrived to climb the almost
  precipitous face of the rock, and after various adventures,&mdash;his perils
  were not ended with his escape from the waves,&mdash;contrived to reach
  Regnum in safety.</p>

  <p>Cogidumnus, the native ruler, a far-sighted prince, who had discovered
  that the friendship of Rome, if not actually desirable, was at least better
  than its enmity, received the stranger in the most hospitable fashion.
  Pudens, after giving, not very willingly, a couple of days to rest, was on
  the point of setting out to join the army of Paulinus when news from Eastern
  Britain changed all his plans. The powerful tribe of the Iceni had broken out
  in open revolt. The colony of Camalodunum had been utterly destroyed, and
  Boadicea, the leader of the rebellion, had sworn that every town in Britain
  that had accepted the Roman supremacy should share its fate. Swift messengers
  were on their way to recall Paulinus from the Northwest, whither he had gone
  to attack the Druid stronghold of Mona. Whether he would get back in time,
  or, getting back in time, would be strong enough to save the friendly Britons
  of the South from the fate that threatened them, seemed only too
  doubtful.</p>

         title="In battle with the Iceni.">

    <p class="caption">In battle with the Iceni.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>These gloomy tidings reached Regnum in the early morning, just as Pudens
  was about to start. The King was intending to ride with his guest for the
  first stage of his journey, a stage which would take him across the Downs
  into the valley of the stream now known as the Western Rother. His daughter,
  an active and spirited girl of sixteen, who as an only and motherless child
  was her father's habitual companion, was going to form one of the party. Just
  as they were riding out of the court-yard of the palace, a messenger hurried
  up in breathless haste. He had been sent by the King's agent at Londinium, a
  trader to whom Cogidumnus was accustomed to consign such goods in the way of
  skins, agricultural produce, and the like as he had to dispose of. He had
  traversed in about twenty-four hours more than seventy miles, mostly of rough
  forest paths, and was in the last stage of exhaustion. The message, written,
  for safety's sake, on a small piece of paper which its bearer could have made
  away with in a moment, ran thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="note"><i>"Camalodunum has been destroyed. Boadicea will enter
  Londinium in a few hours. I have heard nothing of Paulinus. Save
  yourself."</i></p>

  <p>In the course of about half an hour the messenger, who was a well-trained
  and practised runner, had recovered sufficiently to be able to tell what he
  knew. Suetonius, he said, had returned, and had actually marched into
  Londinium, but had evacuated it again, feeling that he was not strong enough
  to hold it. He had about ten thousand men with him, less by nearly a half
  than what he had expected to put into the field, because,&mdash;so the
  messenger had heard,&mdash;the commanding officer of the Second Legion had
  refused to leave his quarters. Paulinus, accordingly, had occupied a strong
  position to the north of the city, and had left Londinium to its fate. Of
  what had happened since his departure the messenger could not speak with
  certainty, but looking back when he reached the highest point of the range
  now known as the Hog's Back, he had seen a great glare of light in the
  northeastern sky, and did not doubt that Londinium was in flames.</p>

  <p>The King was perfectly aware of the gravity of the situation. Verulamium,
  situated as it was little more than twenty miles from Londinium, would
  probably be the next object of attack; after that his own turn would come. In
  the meantime, what was to be done? The King's natural impulse was to make the
  best preparations that he could for defending Regnum. He had begun to make a
  hasty calculation of what was wanted and of what he had at his command, when
  the Princess showed herself in a character that fairly astonished the young
  Roman.</p>

  <p>"Father!" she cried, "it is idle to think of our defending ourselves here.
  If Paulinus cannot stand against Boadicea and her army, how shall we do it,
  when we shall be left alone with all Britain against us? Send every man we
  have to help the Romans now. Then they will be of some use. I wish to Heaven
  I were a man that I might go with them!"</p>

  <p>Pudens was not unaccustomed to see precocity in his own country-women.
  Roman girls began to think and talk of love and lovers before they were well
  in their teens. But this clear and vigorous intelligence, this ready
  comprehension of affairs in one who seemed little more than a child,
  surprised him beyond measure. The advice itself seemed admirable, and he
  seconded it with all his might, offering at the same time his own services in
  any capacity in which they might be made useful. The upshot of the matter was
  that in the course of the day an advance force of some hundreds of men
  started to join the Roman army. The King himself was to follow as speedily as
  possible with the remainder of his available troops; Claudia, with her
  attendants, was put for safety on board a galley in the harbour, the captain
  having instructions to make for a port in Gaul in case any disaster should
  happen. She accepted the situation with a practical good sense which
  impressed Pudens almost as much as her spirit and promptitude had done
  before.</p>

  <p>He did not see her again. He started that evening, and was able to reach
  the camp of Paulinus before the great battle which may be said to have
  settled the fate of Britain for the next three centuries. He was seriously
  wounded in the battle with the Iceni, and after his recovery did not care to
  prolong his service with the general, who, though a great soldier, was a
  harsh administrator. He had come to see war, and the task of hunting down the
  defeated rebels, in which Paulinus would have employed him, was not to his
  taste. Pleading a wish to enlarge his military experience, he obtained
  permission to transfer himself to the Army of the Upper Rhine, and from
  thence again to the Armenian frontier. Here his health had somewhat failed,
  and he had been sent home on leave. But wherever he had been he had carried
  with him the recollection of that bright, eager face, that clear, ringing
  voice. It was a strange sentiment, one which he scarcely acknowledged to
  himself and which he would certainly have found it impossible to define. She
  was but a child, and he had seen her once only, and then for but a few
  minutes. He had scarcely exchanged a word with her. But her image seemed to
  cling to his thoughts with a strange persistence. In the battle and in the
  bivouac "her face across his fancy came," till he began to fancy it a
  talisman of safety, and now, when he found himself again in Rome, it made the
  old evil associations into which opportunity and the want of employment might
  have thrown him again, seem utterly distasteful.</p>

  <p>It is easy to believe that as he rode slowly back to the city that night,
  leaving some half-dozen trusty men to protect the house, the familiar image
  presented itself to his thoughts more vividly than ever.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap09"
     name="chap09"></a>IX. &mdash; AN IMPERIAL MUSICIAN</h2>

  <p class="first">NERO, as my readers will have guessed, had not been able to
  keep his secret. The audacity of his plan&mdash;an Emperor setting his own
  capital on fire that he might rebuild it after his own designs&mdash;had
  inspired him with a delight that quite exceeded his powers of self-control.
  He could not help letting drop hints of his purpose in the presence of
  Poppæa, and these were further explained by words which she overheard him
  muttering in his sleep. Tigellinus, though no confidences were made to him,
  was equally well aware of what his master intended. No department in the
  public service but contained some of his creatures, and the secret
  instructions that the Emperor gave to the commanding officers of the watch,
  summoned, it should be said, to Antium for the purpose of receiving them, did
  not long escape him. The despot's two councillors were rendered, as may
  readily be supposed, not a little anxious by their master's frantic caprice.
  Both were ready enough to use it for their own purposes. Poppæa, as we have
  seen, found in it, as she hoped, an opportunity of destroying Pomponia; while
  Tigellinus had grudges of his own to pay off under cover of the general
  terror and confusion. But they could not help feeling great apprehensions of
  the effect on the popular feeling. An Emperor might murder and confiscate as
  much as he pleased, so long as it was only the noble and wealthy who
  suffered; but when his oppression began to touch common folk, the trader or
  the artisan, then danger was at hand. If the Romans began to suspect that
  they had been burnt out of their homes to gratify a caprice of their ruler,
  not all his legions would be able to save him.</p>

  <p>The anxiety of Nero's advisers was greatly increased by his obstinacy in
  refusing to go to Rome. Relays of messengers came from the capital in rapid
  succession, bringing tidings of the progress of the fire, but the Emperor
  positively refused to leave Antium.</p>

  <p>Tigellinus ventured on a strong remonstrance.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, Sire," he said, "if I say that the Roman people will take your
  absence at this time very ill. It has pleased the gods"&mdash;he was careful,
  it will be seen, not to hint that he knew the truth&mdash;"to visit them with
  a great calamity, and they will expect some sympathy and help from him whom
  they regard as a god upon earth. No ruler could endure to be away when the
  seat of Empire is in flames, much less one who is justly styled the Father of
  his Country."</p>

  <p>The advice, sugared though it was with flattery, was decidedly
  unpalatable. Nero's brow darkened, as he listened, with the frown that always
  gathered upon it when any one ventured to hint that there were any
  limitations on his power, or that he could be called to account by any one
  for the way in which he exercised it.</p>

  <p>"What do you say?" he cried, with an angry stamp of the foot. "A pretty
  thing, indeed, that a father should be called to account by his children! Who
  will venture to say whether I ought to go or to stay?"</p>

  <p>In the course of the second day news arrived that the palace itself was in
  danger. If Tigellinus hoped that this intelligence would move the Emperor he
  was greatly disappointed. Nero received the tidings with what appeared to be
  complete indifference.</p>

  <p>"A paltry place," he cried with a contemptuous shrug of his shoulders,
  "and not in the least worthy of an Emperor! Let it burn, and welcome! I shall
  be saved the trouble of pulling it down. And besides," he added with a laugh,
  "the people about whom you think so much, my Tigellinus, will surely be
  satisfied now. What can they want more than to see my house burning as well
  as their own?"</p>

  <p>Tigellinus was in despair. So imperious was the necessity that he was
  meditating another remonstrance, which yet he felt would probably do nothing
  more than endanger his own head, when Poppæa's woman's wit suggested a way
  out of the difficulty.</p>

  <p>"What a spectacle it must be!" she said to Tigellinus in a low tone that
  was yet carefully modulated to catch the Emperor's ear. "All Rome in flames!
  There never has been anything like it before; there never will be again. If
  we are to have the city burnt, let us at least have the consolation of seeing
  the blaze."</p>

  <p>Nero fell promptly into the trap. "You are right, my soul," he cried. "It
  must be a splendid sight, and I am losing it. Why did you not think of it
  before? Tigellinus, we will start at once. There is not a moment to be
  lost."</p>

  <p>The Emperor's impatience to be gone, now that the idea had been suggested
  to him, was as great as his indifference had been before. He would allow no
  time for the preparations for departure. The slaves would follow, he said,
  with what was wanted. Too much of the sight had been lost already. "Good
  Heavens!" he cried, "what a fool I have been! The finest spectacle of the
  age, and I am not there to see it!"</p>

  <p>Within an hour's time he was on horseback, and was riding at full speed
  northward, accompanied by Tigellinus and by such an escort as could hastily
  be got ready. Poppæa followed in a carriage as rapidly as she could.</p>

  <p>The distance between Antium and Rome, which was something like thirty
  miles, was covered by the horsemen in less than three hours. From the first a
  heavy cloud of smoke was visible in the northeastern sky; as the riders went
  on they encountered other signs of the disaster. There was a constant stream
  of carts and wagons loaded with furniture and other miscellaneous effects,
  that were travelling southward. The owners of the property accompanied them
  on foot, though now and then a child or an old man or woman might be seen
  perched on the top of the goods. These, of course, were people who had been
  burnt out by the fire, and who were now seeking a temporary home with
  relatives or friends whom they were fortunate enough to possess in the
  country. As they approached the walls, the fields on either side of the road
  were covered with tents and huts in which the homeless refugees had found
  shelter. The roads themselves were lined with people who, indeed, had no
  other occupation but to watch the passers- by. The beggars, always numerous
  along the great thoroughfares, were now in greater force than ever.
  Tigellinus, who, vicious as he was, was a man of intelligence and foresight,
  had brought with him all the money that he could collect. This Nero scattered
  with a liberal hand among the crowds as he rode along. This is a kind of
  bounty that has always an effective appearance, though the money commonly
  falls into the hands of those who need it least. The spectators cheered the
  Emperor, whose well-known features were recognized everywhere, with
  tumultuous shouts. But there were not a few who turned away in silent disgust
  or wrath. They did not, indeed, attribute directly to him the calamity which
  had overtaken them, as they might have done had they known the truth, but
  they laid it at his door all the same. He was a great criminal, a murderer,
  and a parricide; his offences were rank before heaven, and had brought down,
  as the offences of rulers are apt to bring down, the anger of the gods upon
  his people.</p>

  <p>The palace was not, it was found, in immediate danger. All the efforts of
  the Watch and of two cohorts of Prætorians, which had been called in to help
  them, had been directed to saving it. How long it would escape was doubtful.
  If the wind, which had lulled a little, were to rise again, its destruction
  was certain.</p>

  <p>The Emperor would have been disappointed if this destruction had been
  finally averted. We have seen that one of the great features of the new Rome
  that he had planned was an Imperial palace far larger and more splendid than
  anything that the world had ever seen before. Still he was glad of the
  respite, for it enabled him to put into execution a scheme, extravagantly
  strange, even for him, which he had conceived during his rapid journey from
  Antium to Rome.</p>

  <p>"A spectacle," he thought to himself, "and if so, why not a performance?
  What a splendid opportunity! We always feel that there is something of a sham
  in the scenery of a theatre, but here it will be real. An actual city on
  fire! What could be more magnificent? I have it," he went on after a pause.
  "Of course it must be the Sack of Troy. What a pity it is that I did not
  think of it sooner, and I might have written something worthy of the
  occasion. The Lesser Iliad is but poor stuff, but we must make the best of
  it."</p>

  <p>This grotesque intention was actually carried out.</p>

  <p>The first care of the Emperor on reaching the palace was to have a
  rehearsal of his contemplated performance. If there were any cares of Empire
  pressing for attention,&mdash;and it may be supposed that the ruler of the
  civilized world returning to his capital had some business to attend
  to,&mdash;they were put aside. The rest of the day Nero spent in practising
  upon the harp some music of his own composition, while a Greek freedman
  recited from the Lesser Iliad a passage in which the sack and burning of Troy
  were related.</p>

  <p>In the evening the performance took place. A large semicircular room in
  the upper story of the palace, commanding from its windows a wide prospect of
  the city, was hastily fitted up into the rude semblance of a theatre. An
  audience, which mainly consisted of the Emperor's freedmen and of officers of
  the Prætorian Guard, sat on chairs ranged round the curve of the chamber. In
  front of them was the extemporized stage, while the burning city, seen
  through the windows, formed, with huge masses of smoke and flame, such a
  background as the most skilful and audacious of scene-painters had never
  conceived. The performance had been purposely postponed till a late hour in
  the evening, and no lights were permitted in the room. On the stage were the
  two figures, the reciter and the Imperial musician, now thrown strongly into
  relief as some great sheet of flame burst out in the background, and then, as
  it died away again, becoming almost invisible. An undertone of confused sound
  accompanied the music throughout. Every now and then the voice of the reciter
  and the notes of the harp were lost in some shrill cry of agony or the
  thunderous crash of a falling house. Seldom in the history of the world has
  there been a stranger mixture of the ludicrous and the terrible than when
  "Nero fiddled while Rome was burning."</p>

  <p>At one time it was not unlikely that this strange farce might have been
  turned into a genuine tragedy. Subrius was one of the Prætorian officers
  invited to witness the performance, and chance had placed him close to the
  stage. Again and again as the Emperor moved across it, intent upon his music,
  and certainly unsuspicious of danger, he came within easy reach of the
  Tribune's arm.</p>

  <p>"Shall I strike?" he whispered into the ear of Lateranus, who sat by his
  side. "I can hardly hope for a better chance."</p>

  <p>Probably a prompt assent from his companion would have decided him; but
  Lateranus felt unequal to giving it. He was staggered by the suddenness of
  the idea. The decision was too momentous, the responsibility too great. Was
  it right to act without the knowledge of the other conspirators? Then nothing
  had been prepared. Nero might be killed, but no arrangements had been made
  for presenting a successor to the soldiers and to the people. Finally, there
  was the immediate danger to themselves. It would indeed be a memorable deed
  to strike down this unworthy ruler in the very act of disgracing the people,
  to strike him down before the eyes of the creatures who flattered and fawned
  on him. But could they who did it hope to escape? "The desire of escape,"
  says the historian who relates the incident, "is always the foe of great
  enterprises," and it checked that night a deed which might have changed the
  course of history.</p>

  <p>"No!" whispered Lateranus in reply, "it is too soon; nothing, you know, is
  ready. We shall not fail to find another opportunity."</p>

  <p>Half reluctant, half relieved, Subrius abandoned his half-formed purpose.
  But he could not rid himself of the feeling that he had missed a great
  chance.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe in inspirations?" he asked his friend, as they were making
  their way to the camp, where Lateranus was his guest.</p>

  <p>"I hardly know," replied the other. "Perhaps there are such things. But,
  on the whole, men find it safer to act after deliberation."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Subrius, "if ever I felt an inspiration, it was to-night when
  I whispered to you. I fear much that we shall never have so fair a chance
  again."</p>

  <p>"But nothing was ready," urged his companion.</p>

  <p>"True," replied Subrius; "but then one does not prepare for such an
  enterprise as this as one prepares for a campaign."</p>

  <p>"And the risk?"</p>

  <p>"True, the risk. It is not that one is afraid to venture one's life; but
  one wants to see the fruit of one's deed. Yet I much misdoubt me whether this
  is not a fatal weakness. One ought to do the right thing at the time, and
  think of nothing else. If Cassius Chærea had taken any thought for his own
  safety, he would never have slain the monster Caius. I feel that hereafter we
  shall be sorry for what we have done, or, rather, not done, to-day."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10"></a>X. &mdash; A GREAT BRIBE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE fire continued to devour its prey almost without let or
  hindrance. Even before the end of the performance described in my last
  chapter it had come so near that the heat could be distinctly felt by the
  spectators. Nero, whose ambition it was to imitate the imperturbable
  self-possession of a great actor, affected to be unconscious of what
  everybody else felt to be inconvenient, if not alarming. He gave the whole of
  the piece down to the very last flourish or roulade, and, when at last it was
  concluded, came forward again and again to receive the applause which a
  clique of duly practised flatterers did not fail time after time to
  renew.</p>

  <p>In spite, however, of this seeming composure, the Emperor was seriously
  agitated. The fire was a monster which he had created, but which he could not
  control. It did not limit its ravages to what he wished to see swept away.
  Even the most reckless of rulers could not view with total indifference the
  destruction of relics of antiquity which he knew that his subjects regarded
  with universal reverence. The damage indeed was incredibly great. It may be
  said, in fact, that all ancient Rome disappeared. Among the losses was the
  very oldest structure in the city, one that dated from before its foundation,
  going back to the little Greek colony which had once existed on the Palatine,
  the altar which Evander the Arcadian consecrated to Hercules, and at which,
  it was said, the hero himself had feasted. Another was the temple vowed to
  Jupiter the Stayer by Romulus in the anxious moment when the fate of the
  infant Empire seemed to be hanging in the balance; a third was the palace of
  Numa, still roofed with the primitive thatch under which the earliest of the
  Roman law- givers had been content to find shelter. A fourth, the most
  disastrous loss of all, as appealing most strongly to the public sentiment,
  was what may be called the Hearth of the Roman People, the Temple of the
  Household Gods of Rome, which stood on the summit of the Palatine Hill. Not
  only was the building destroyed, but the images themselves, said to be the
  very same that Æneas had carried out of burning Troy, and, undoubtedly, of an
  immemorial antiquity, perished with it.</p>

  <p>Active exertions were now taken to check the conflagration. On the sixth
  day a huge gap was made by the destruction of a great block of buildings at
  the foot of the Esquiline, the Emperor himself superintending the operation.
  For a time this energetic remedy promised to be effective; but, after
  nightfall, the fire broke out again, and raged for three days longer, this
  time consuming regions of the city which Nero himself in his wildest mood
  would never have dreamt of destroying. When at last the second outburst was
  checked, it was found that out of the fourteen districts into which Rome was
  divided, four only remained untouched. In three there was absolutely nothing
  left; in the other seven some buildings, most of them bare walls, still
  stood, but many more had perished, or were in such a state that they would
  have to be pulled down.</p>

  <p>Eager as he was to commence the building of a new and more splendid Rome,
  Nero was obliged first to consider the pressing needs of the houseless
  multitude which crowded every open space in the neighbourhood of the city.
  Policy, for of sympathy he seems to have been hardly capable, made him spare
  neither trouble nor expense in relieving their wants. To house them he gave
  up the splendid structures which Agrippa, the son-in-law of Augustus, had
  erected in the Field of Mars. The noble colonnades, the baths, commonly
  reserved for the Imperial use, the vast enclosures where the people still
  met, not indeed to elect, but to register their master's choice of Consuls,
  Prætors, and Tribunes; even the temples were thrown open to shelter the
  houseless crowds. As these did not suffice, huts and tents were hastily
  erected in the Emperor's own gardens, slight structures, of course, but still
  sufficient for the purpose, for it was the height of summer, and it was the
  sun rather than the rain from which shelter was chiefly wanted.</p>

  <p>The sufferers, of course, had to be fed as well as lodged. The gratuitous
  distributions of corn, which it was customary to make, were more frequent and
  more extensive, for there was a total suspension of business, and many who
  were not usually pensioners on the bounty of the State had to be relieved. To
  meet the case of those who were too independent to receive alms, and yet were
  scarcely above the need of them, the price of corn was lowered by a
  subvention to the merchants from the Emperor's purse. Wheat became cheap
  beyond all precedent, a bushel being sold for two shillings. The wealthy
  nobles, either from compassion for the sufferers, or, where this was wanting,
  at a peremptory suggestion from Nero, supplemented the Emperor's bounty by a
  copious distribution of gifts. These gifts were always common, even
  respectable people condescending to supplement their income by what they
  received from the great houses to which they were attached by the tie of
  clientship; now they became more frequent and more extensive, and were on a
  much more liberal scale.</p>

  <p>The enormous operations of clearing away the ruins and building a new city
  furnished an immense amount of employment and stimulated trade; in fact, in
  one way or another, put a great deal of money in circulation. But, in
  addition to food, shelter, and employment, the people wanted another thing,
  if they were to be kept in good humour, and that was amusement. In furnishing
  this Nero consulted his own tastes as well as his interests. As soon as was
  possible, and even while much that would have been thought far more necessary
  yet remained to be done, Nero made preparations to give a grand
  entertainment, the splendour of which could not fail, he hoped, to put Rome
  into a good humour. It is quite possible that from his point of view he was
  right. The passion of the populace for these great shows was boundless. Of
  the two things for which they were said to have bartered their freedom,
  gratuitous food and gratuitous spectacles, the latter was the more coveted.
  Rome would have preferred being hungry to being dull.</p>

  <p>The solid structure of the great Circus had, as has been said, resisted
  the fire. What had perished was hastily renewed, and no pains or money,
  scarce as money was at a time of such vast expenditure, was spared in
  collecting ample materials for exhibition. Gladiators were, of course,
  abundant, and gladiators were always the staple of a popular show. Give the
  Roman spectator bloodshed enough and he could not fail to be satisfied. Of
  the curiosities of the Circus, as they may be called, the rare beasts, the
  performing animals, and the like, there was a less plentiful supply. Many had
  been destroyed in the fire, and substitutes could not be provided in a hurry;
  still a certain number were available. The menageries of the great provincial
  towns were swept bare to supply this sudden demand from the capital, and
  private owners were eager to do their best to supply an Imperial customer,
  who paid well for what he bought, and had a way of taking by force what he
  wanted, if the persuasion of a large price was not enough.</p>

  <p>The day of exhibition was in the latter end of September, somewhat less
  than three months, i.e.; after the catastrophe of the fire. It had not been
  possible to make the arrangements sooner, and indeed the Romans preferred the
  spring and autumn weather for their great shows. The more temperate weather
  suited the spectators better than did either the cold of winter or the
  extreme heat of summer. Everything favoured the spectacle. The day was both
  cloudless and windless, both circumstances that contributed to its success.
  Nothing, indeed, could have been finer than the sight of the vast building
  filled from end to end with a crowd of spectators, the men wearing spotless
  white gowns and crowned with garlands of flowers, the women habited in a rich
  variety of colours. The effect of the sun shining through the red and purple
  awning that was stretched over the heads of the people was itself very
  striking.</p>

  <p>The show began, as usual, with the exhibition of rare and beautiful
  animals. Bloodshed, as has been said, was the staple of the entertainment;
  but as the hors d'&oelig;uvres, the soup, the fish, and the various dishes
  lead up to the pièces de résistance in a banquet, so the appetite of the
  Roman public was whetted with various curiosities before it was allowed to
  reach the great business of the day. Ostriches, whose white plumage was dyed
  with vermilion, for the false taste of the Romans was not satisfied with
  nature, lions with gilded manes, and antelopes and gazelles, curiously
  adorned with light-colored scarves and gold tinsel, trooped in succession
  across the arena, each under the charge of its keeper. The tameness of some
  of these animals was wonderful. If one could not praise the art with which it
  had been sought to heighten their natural beauty of form and hue, yet the
  skill with which their innate savagery and wildness had been subdued was
  truly admirable. Lions yoked with tigers, and panthers harnessed with bears,
  were seen drawing carriages with all the docility of the horse. Wild bulls
  were seen, now permitting boys and girls to dance upon their backs, and now,
  at the word of command, standing erect on their hind legs. A still more
  wonderful sight was when a lion hunted a hare, caught it, and carried it in
  its mouth, unhurt, to its master. This performance, indeed, brought down a
  tremendous round of applause. Nero summoned the trainer of the lion to his
  seat, and praised him highly for his skill. The man answered him with a
  compliment which may fairly be described as having been as neat as it was
  false. "It is no skill of mine, my lord," he said, "that has worked this
  marvel; the beast is gentle because he knows how gentle is the Emperor whom
  he serves."</p>

  <p>Gentleness, certainly, was not the prevailing characteristic of the sports
  that followed. A Roman's curiosity and love of the marvellous were easily
  satisfied. Of fighting he never could have enough. He loved best to do it
  himself,&mdash;it is but justice to say so much for him,&mdash;and next he
  loved to see others do it. The first kind of combat exhibited was of beast
  against beast. A dog of the Molossian breed, much the same as our mastiff, a
  breed famous then, as now, for strength and courage, was matched with a bull,
  and came off victorious. A lion was pitted against a tiger, but proved to be
  far inferior not only in courage, but in strength. A combat between a bull
  and a rhinoceros was a great disappointment to the spectators, who expected a
  novel sensation from combatants which, as far as was known, had never
  contended together before. First, the rhinoceros was very reluctant to engage
  with his adversary. Amidst yells and shouts of derision from the crowd he
  retreated into his cage. It was only after hot iron had been applied to its
  hide, the extraordinary thickness of which resisted the application of the
  goad, and trumpets had been blown into its ears, that the creature was
  induced to advance. And then the conflict, when it did take place, was of the
  very briefest. The bull, a naturally savage animal, who had been goaded into
  madness by fluttering pennons of red and by the pricks of spears, rushed
  furiously forward to vent its rage, after the manner of its kind, on the
  first object that it saw. The rhinoceros lifted its head and sent the bull
  flying into the air as easily as if it had been a truss of straw. When the
  bull came to the ground, it was absolutely dead, its enemy's horn having
  pierced a vital part.</p>

  <p>Another novel spectacle, a lion matched against a crocodile, was scarcely
  more successful. The lion approached its strange antagonist, and laid hold of
  it, but rather it seemed from curiosity than from anger. A short inspection
  seemed to satisfy the beast that the strange, scaly creature was not a
  desirable or even possible prey. Loosing his hold, he carelessly turned away,
  and cantered round the arena, glaring in a very alarming way through the
  grating which separated him from the lowest tier of spectators. As for the
  crocodile, whatever its intentions, it was helpless. Its movements on land
  were far too cumbrous to allow it to force a battle on its antagonist.</p>

  <p>When the wild beast show had been finished there was an interval for
  refreshment. The Emperor, anxious to please the multitude, had provided for
  the gratuitous distribution of an immense quantity of food. Slaves carrying
  huge baskets of loaves were followed by others with baskets, equally huge, of
  sausages. Almost every one who cared to have his food supplied in this way
  was able to get it for nothing. Wine was not absolutely given away, but it
  was sold at a rate so cheap that the poorest spectator could purchase enough
  or even more than enough. The smallest coin, an as, equivalent to something
  less than a half-penny, could purchase half a sextarius&mdash;a sextarius may
  be taken as roughly equivalent to a pint&mdash;of very fair liquor, rough, of
  course, but well- bodied and sound, and far superior to the posca or diluted
  vinegar which formed the staple drink of the lowest class. When the
  exhibition recommenced, about two hours after noon, the spectators were in a
  state of uproarious good humour.</p>

  <p>The first exhibition of the afternoon was a chariot-race. The competing
  chariots were kept in a set of chambers, technically called "prisons," which
  were furnished with folding doors that opened out on to the race-course. When
  the presiding officer gave the usual signal for starting by dropping a
  napkin, slaves who were told off to perform this office simultaneously opened
  the doors of the "prisons," and the chariots, which were standing ready for a
  start within, made the best of their way out. In theory this was as fair a
  method of proceeding as possible; but in practise difficulties arose. The
  slaves did not always work with absolute uniformity. It was whispered that
  they were sometimes bribed to bungle over their task; and as the business of
  racing, and especially horse-racing, has always given occasion to a great
  deal of rascality, the suspicion was probably well-founded. On the present
  occasion there was certainly a hitch which may or may not have been
  accidental, but which certainly caused a great amount of irritation among the
  spectators. The doors of one of the "prisons" stuck fast for a few moments,
  and the chariot inside had, in consequence, a most unfavourable start. As the
  driver was a special favourite with the people, wore the most popular
  colours, and had the reputation of never having been beaten in a fair race,
  this contretemps was received with a perfect howl of execration. Man and
  horses did their best as soon as they were able to get away; chariot after
  chariot was passed, till of the six that had started, only one was left to
  vanquish. But this competitor could not be overtaken. He had got a start of
  nearly half a lap out of the seven which made up the course; and as he was a
  skilful driver, with an excellent team of horses, this advantage gave him the
  victory. For a moment, indeed, the race seemed undecided. Just as the two
  remaining competitors, all other rivals having by this time been distanced,
  were nearing the turning-point in the last lap, the charioteer who had been
  so unluckily delayed made a supreme effort to secure the advantage of the
  nearer curve. In his excitement he used the lash too freely. The spirited
  animal which he struck resented the blow, and swerved so violently as to
  throw the charioteer. The man burst into tears of vexation and rage, due at
  least as much to the feeling of self- reproach as to vexation at his
  ill-fortune. Not even the purse of gold which Nero threw to him, nor the
  sympathizing cries from his friends among the crowd, consoled him.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Chariot Race.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>After this everything seemed to go wrong. When the gladiators came on the
  scene, which they did immediately after the decision of the chariot-race, the
  popular favourite was almost uniformly unlucky. A veteran net-fighter, who
  had been victorious in a hundred battles, and who was accustomed to charm the
  spectators by the easy dexterity with which he would entangle his adversary,
  made an unlucky slip as he was throwing his net, and was stabbed to the heart
  by a mere tyro, who had never before appeared in the arena. Another old
  favourite, a mirmillo, from some unaccountable cause lost his nerve, when
  confronted with an active young Thracian, in whom he had not expected to find
  a formidable enemy, and having delivered to no purpose his favourite stroke,
  actually turned to fly. The populace, forgetting as usual the poor fellow's
  many successes, expressed its disapprobation by an angry howl, and when the
  fugitive was struck down, absolutely refused to spare his life.</p>

  <p>When at last the show was over, when the dead, of whom some thirty lay on
  the sand, had been examined by an attendant habited as Charon, ferryman of
  the Styx, and removed under the superintendence of another official who bore
  the wand of Hermes the Conductor of Souls, the irritation of the populace
  broke forth in angry cries levelled against no less a personage than the
  Emperor himself. The Circus, it must be remembered, was the place where
  something of the old liberty of the Roman people still remained. There it was
  still permitted to them to express their wants and their dislikes. The
  Emperors, despotic as they were, were prudent enough to allow a safety-valve
  for a discontent which, if always suppressed, might have become really
  dangerous; nor were they averse to thus learning without the intervention of
  others what their humbler subjects really thought and felt. On this occasion
  there was a really formidable manifestation of feeling. Loud cries of
  "Incendiary!" "Paris the Firebrand!" and, with allusion to former misdeeds,
  of "Orestes the Matricide!" "Vengeance for Agrippina!" "Vengeance for
  Octavia!" "Vengeance for Britannicus!" "Give us back the children of
  Augustus!" rent the air. The Emperor at first affected indifference or
  disdain. Coming to the front of the magnificent box from which he had
  witnessed the spectacle, he threw the contents of bags of coin among the
  crowd. Many of the malcontents were not proof against this bribe, and
  scrambled for the coins with the usual eagerness, but some were seen to spit
  upon what they had picked up, and throw them away again with a gesture of
  disgust. Nero then hastily left the Circus, closely guarded by a cohort of
  Prætorians. He had at last learnt that there was a formidable amount of
  discontent which he must find some means of allaying.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11"></a>XI. &mdash; A SCAPEGOAT</h2>

  <p class="first">ON the evening of the day of the great show just described,
  Nero was again deep in consultation with his two advisers. He had been
  profoundly impressed by the manifestations of popular feeling that he had
  that day witnessed in the Circus. Hitherto he had been, on the whole, in
  spite of his follies and excesses, a popular Emperor. The nobility hated him,
  not without cause, for the most illustrious among them could not feel that
  property or life were safe under his rule. The small party of independent
  patriots, which a hundred and twenty years of despotic rule had left, loathed
  and despised the young mountebank who was squandering away all the resources,
  and tarnishing all the glories of Rome. But the multitude had a strange
  indulgence for their young ruler. His presence, stately enough when the
  defects of his figure were concealed, his handsome face, his open
  hand,&mdash;for he could give away as well as spend,&mdash;his very vices, so
  magnificent was the scale on which they were practised, attracted a certain
  interest and even favour. As long as this popular favour lasted, and the
  soldiers were kept in good humour, a point on which his vigilance never
  relaxed, Nero felt himself safe, in spite of the hatred of the nobles and the
  philosophers. Accordingly the seditious cries that he had heard during the
  day, heard too at the close of an entertainment in which the amusement of the
  multitude had been provided for with lavish care, alarmed him greatly, and he
  lost no time in seeking advice.</p>

  <p>No direct reference was made to the immediate occasion of the consultation
  either by the Emperor or by his advisers. It was not etiquette to suppose
  that any one would venture to utter injurious words against the Augustus, the
  Master of Rome, the equal of gods. The same silence was observed as to the
  real truth about the fire. Nero, as we have seen, had not been able to keep
  his own secret; he had even gone the length, in moments of abandonment, of
  boasting of his deed, and that to both of the persons present; but
  nevertheless both he and they agreed in speaking of it as a disastrous event
  of which the cause was yet to be discovered.</p>

  <p>The Emperor opened the discussion:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Tigellinus," he said, "the gods have visited Rome with a great calamity.
  Such things do not happen without a cause. There must have been some great
  wickedness, some monstrous impiety at work. The people demand, and are right
  in demanding, the punishment of the guilty. Tell me, how are they to be
  found? And when they are found, how are they to be punished?"</p>

  <p>"Sire," said Tigellinus, "I have inquired of the Triumvirs, and they tell
  me that they have in custody twenty or thirty wretches who were caught, red-
  handed, spreading the fire. Some of them were also convicted of robbery, and
  some of murder. What say you, Sire, to having a public execution of these
  malefactors? They might suffer together, and the spectacle might be made
  sufficiently imposing to satisfy the just indignation of the people."</p>

  <p>The proposition was made and received with a perfect gravity which did
  credit to the power of acting possessed by the speaker and his hearers.</p>

  <p>Nero affected to meditate. The real thought in his mind was that some of
  the victims might make awkward revelations. What he said was this:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The punishment, however exemplary, of some score of incendiaries, will
  not suffice. If it had been the case of some provincial municipality
  destroyed, it might have been otherwise. Is it not possible that the enemies
  of the Roman people, the Parthians or the Germans, have plotted the
  destruction of the seat of Empire?"</p>

  <p>"The Parthians, Sire," returned Tigellinus with an air of profound
  humility, "are just now our very good friends, and whether they are guilty or
  not, it would be inconvenient to accuse them. We must begin by seizing the
  young Princes whom we have as hostages, and this would most certainly be
  followed by war."</p>

  <p>"But Corbulo and my legions would be more than a match for these
  barbarians," replied the Emperor haughtily.</p>

  <p>"True, Sire, most true," said the vizier with a sarcasm not wholly
  concealed by the deference with which it was veiled. "But Corbulo thinks that
  another campaign would not now be for the advantage of the Empire."</p>

  <p>The speaker's real meaning was that the military successes of Corbulo made
  him at least as formidable to his master as to the enemy, and that it would
  not be politic to give him another opportunity of increasing them.</p>

  <p>Nero, who was quick enough to know where his real danger lay, nodded his
  acquiescence.</p>

  <p>"And the Germans?" he said after a pause.</p>

  <p>Tigellinus slightly shrugged his shoulders. "That hardly seems probable.
  Those thick-witted barbarians can scarcely have devised such a plot."</p>

  <p>A period of uneasy silence followed. Tigellinus was even more impressed
  than was Nero with the gravity of the situation, for he knew more of the very
  deep and widespread feelings to which the cries in the Circus had given
  expression, and he was absolutely at a loss for a policy. The people
  suspected Nero of having caused the late disaster, and suspected him with
  very good reason; what reasonable chance was there of turning these
  suspicions in some other direction?</p>

  <p>Suddenly a great scheme crossed his mind. Himself of the meanest origin,
  Tigellinus felt a jealous hatred for the old nobility. Not a few of the
  foremost members had already fallen victims to his craft, and now he seemed
  to perceive a chance of dealing the order a damaging blow.</p>

  <p>"Sire," he began, "it is an enemy from within, rather than an enemy from
  without, that has to be dreaded. You remember the story of Catiline?"</p>

  <p>"Surely," replied the Emperor.</p>

  <p>"In those days," went on the favourite, "a set of needy and unscrupulous
  nobles, beggared by their own extravagance and luxury, plotted to overthrow
  the Republic, and one of their methods was conflagration. There are the same
  causes still at work,&mdash;pride, poverty, and extravagance. Where these are
  to be found there will always be a Catiline. Then the play was stopped before
  the prologue was spoken; now it may well be that we have had the first
  act."</p>

  <p>"Is this a mere suspicion of yours, or do you speak from knowledge?" asked
  the Emperor.</p>

  <p>Before the Minister could answer Poppæa interposed. She had a shrewd idea
  of what Tigellinus was aiming at&mdash;a huge proscription of the nobles, to
  be brought about by working on the suspicions of Nero, and to result in his
  own aggrandizement in wealth and power, on a scale equally huge. Such a
  scheme was not to her taste. Her own sympathies were largely aristocratic;
  she prided herself on a high descent, at least, on the mother's side. She was
  willing enough to join in the overthrow of this or that noble, and to share
  in his spoils, but a general ruin of the order did not suit her wishes or her
  plans. Among other reasons was her fear lest her associate should become too
  great. At present he was willing to be her ally, but she knew that he would
  like far better to be the only power behind the throne. And she had, besides,
  a scheme of her own to further, and animosities of her own to gratify.</p>

  <p>"Sire," she began, "there are men in Rome who are enemies not only of the
  Roman people, but of the whole human race, and these may very well have begun
  their impious work by attempting to destroy the most glorious of the
  habitations of mankind. You have heard of Christus, and the people who call
  themselves after his name?"</p>

  <p>"Surely," replied Nero. "Was not that Paulus, a Jew of Tarsus, if I
  remember right, a chief man among them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed," cried Poppæa; "and a most pernicious fellow, a ringleader
  in all their mischievous doings! "</p>

  <p>Poppæa, in fact, regarded the Apostle with feelings of the strongest
  aversion. Not long after his arrival at Rome, rather more than two years
  before, some rumour about him had reached her, and had greatly excited her
  curiosity. A famous Jewish teacher, she heard, had come to Rome. He was a
  prophet, it was said, and what was still more interesting, a worker of
  wonders. Accordingly she had sent for him. The interview had been a
  disappointment, and worse than a disappointment. She was then intriguing for
  a share in the Imperial throne, and wanted this wonderful seer to predict the
  future for her. She heard from his lips no prophecy in her sense of the word,
  but certain plain words about purity, justice, mercy, such as it is the
  highest function of the prophet to utter. She concealed her vexation, and
  even pretended to be impressed by what she had heard. "Would he," she said,
  "confirm his authority, as a teacher, by performing one of the wonders which
  he had the power, she was told, to work?" The Apostle peremptorily refused.
  He was permitted, he said, sometimes thus to relieve the sick and suffering,
  but he would not gratify an idle curiosity. With this the interview had
  ended, and she had never sought to repeat it. In process of time to this
  personal offence had been added another cause of dislike. Poppæa's Jewish
  friends in Rome had received communications from Jerusalem, which made them
  actively hostile to the Apostle, and she, though of course understanding
  little or nothing about the difference between Jew and Christian, had taken
  their side. When the Apostle was brought to answer for his life before the
  Emperor, all her influence had been used to bring about his condemnation, and
  his acquittal and subsequent release had caused her the greatest
  annoyance.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Nero, "I always thought, my sweetest Poppæa, that you were
  somewhat too hard on the poor man. You would have had me condemn him, but I
  really could see no harm in him. I will allow that he did not appear to be
  quite in his right senses. He talked some quite unintelligible nonsense about
  his Master, as he called him. At one time he said that he was a man, and at
  another that he was a god. He maintained that he had died. That seemed a
  great point with him, though why any one should make so much of his Master
  having been crucified, it is hard to see. And then again he insisted that he
  was alive. Altogether he made the strangest jumble that I have ever heard
  from human lips. And he spoke Greek, I remember, but poorly, and with a very
  strong accent. Still, he had the air of a learned man, and he talked as if he
  really believed what he said. And certainly, whether he was in his senses or
  not, I could find no harm in him. No, my Poppæa, you were always a little
  unreasonable about this Paulus. If his followers are no worse than he, there
  can be nothing very wrong about them."</p>

  <p>"Sire," replied Poppæa, "the kindness of your heart makes you unwilling to
  believe the truth. I cannot tell you a tenth part of the horrible things that
  are said, and I believe truly said, about these followers of
  Christus&mdash;Christiani they call them."</p>

  <p>"Surely, my dearest," said Nero with a smile, "they are nothing worse than
  a new kind of Jew, and for the Jews, you have, I know, a liking."</p>

  <p>"Sire," said Poppæa with no little heat, "they are as different from Jews
  as darkness is different from light. They are atheists, though they worship,
  I believe, some strange demons; they have no love for their country; they
  will not serve in the legions; in fact, as I said, they are the enemies of
  mankind. And as to the dreadful things which they do at their feasts, they
  are beyond belief. That they sacrifice children, and banquet on their flesh,
  is among the least of the horrors which they commit."</p>

  <p>"Tigellinus," said Nero, "do you know anything about these Christians whom
  the Empress seems to dislike so much?"</p>

  <p>"They are a strange people," replied the Minister, "who cling to their
  gloomy superstition with a most invincible obstinacy. That they never
  sacrifice to the gods, or even eat of the sacrifices of others, that they
  will not enter the Circus or the theatre, and lead altogether a joyless
  life&mdash;this I know. That they never serve in the legions can hardly be
  true. I heard that when you last gave a donation to the Prætorians, and the
  men came to receive it, wearing garlands on their heads, one man alone came
  carrying his garland in his hand. "The law of Christus, his Master," he said,
  "forbade him to crown himself." And to this he adhered most inflexibly,
  though he not only lost his gold pieces, but was almost beaten to death by
  the Centurions for disobeying orders."</p>

  <p>"And what about these crimes that are laid to their charge?" asked the
  Emperor. "Are they really guilty of them, think you?"</p>

  <p>"That I cannot say," Tigellinus answered; "but that the people believe
  them to be guilty I know for certain."</p>

  <p>"And are they guilty, think you," Nero went on, "of this wickedness
  concerning the city?"</p>

  <p>"That the people will believe them to be guilty, I do not doubt," said
  Tigellinus.</p>

  <p>Nero caught eagerly at the idea. An obscure sect, for whom no one would
  feel any sympathy or compassion, who, on the contrary, were hated by all who
  had heard of them,&mdash;just the victims that he wanted.</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," cried Nero, "we have found, thanks to the prudence and wisdom
  of the Empress, and to my own good fortune, the real criminals. I charge you,
  Tigellinus, with the care of seeing that these miscreants are properly
  punished."</p>

  <p>"It shall be done, Sire, without delay; and that so completely that no one
  will have reason to complain of slackness of justice."</p>

  <p>It was one of the arts by which this unscrupulous politician retained the
  Emperor's favour that he knew how to yield. His own scheme he was content for
  the present to postpone. It would be difficult and even dangerous to execute
  it. It might be more safely carried on piecemeal. Meanwhile, there was an
  urgent need which had to be met, and Poppæa's scheme seemed to provide for it
  in the best possible manner. Better scapegoats than these obscure sectaries,
  of whom few professed to know anything, and those few nothing that was not
  bad, could not well be found. He bowed his acquiescence and left the Imperial
  presence to devise a plan for carrying out his orders.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE EDICT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE young soldier Pudens had been fully employed since we
  last heard of him. The work of clearing away the débris of the fire had
  proved to be so vast that the ordinary supply of labour had been insufficient
  to meet the demand, and the help of the soldiers had been called in. A force,
  half naval and half military, which was raised from the fleets of Ravenna and
  Misenum, and which indeed was accustomed to do the work of pioneers, was told
  off for the purpose, and Pudens, partly through the interest of his friend
  Subrius, was appointed to be second in command. Among the civilians employed
  in the same work was an elderly man with whom he happened to be brought into
  frequent contact, and whose manners and conversation interested him very
  much. From some chance remark, Pudens learnt that his new acquaintance was a
  freedman, who had been emancipated by Pomponia shortly after her husband's
  death, and indeed in obedience to a request made in his will. The man could
  not say too much in praise of his patroness, of her blameless life, her
  boundless charity. "They call her sad and gloomy, sir," he said, on one
  occasion; "and indeed she does not care for the gayeties and pleasures of
  Rome; but a happier woman does not live within the borders of the Empire, if
  to be always content, to have nothing to repent of in life, and to fear
  nothing in death, be happiness." He was apparently going to say more, but
  checked himself. More than once Pudens observed a similar pause, and as he
  was not a little interested in the lady herself, and still more in her young
  companion Claudia, his curiosity was greatly excited. It should be said that,
  acting on a hint from Subrius, he had not attempted to improve his
  acquaintance with the two ladies. Visitors would attract attention, and it
  was necessary, he had been given to understand, that they should live for the
  present in complete retirement.</p>

  <p>Before long an accident enabled him to penetrate the secret of the
  freedman's reserve. Returning to his quarters one evening in the late summer,
  he found his friend&mdash;for such the freedman had by this time
  become&mdash;in the hands of some soldiers. The spot happened to be on the
  boundary of two townships, and a statue of the god Terminus&mdash;a pedestal
  with a roughly carved head&mdash;had been placed there. The men, who were
  half tipsy, were insisting that the freedman&mdash;whom we may hereafter call
  by his name Linus&mdash;should pay his homage to the statue; Linus was
  resolutely refusing to comply.</p>

  <p>"Hold!" cried Pudens, as he appeared on the scene, knowing of course
  nothing of what had happened, and only seeing a civilian in the hands of some
  unruly soldiers. "Hold! what do you mean by assaulting a peaceable
  citizen?"</p>

  <p>"He is an atheist, a Christian; he refuses to worship the gods," cried one
  of the men.</p>

  <p>"Who made you a champion of the gods?" retorted Pudens. "You are behaving
  more like robbers than like god-fearing men."</p>

  <p>"Lay hold of him, too, comrades," shouted one of the men.</p>

  <p>Pudens recognized the voice of the last speaker. He was a Deputy-
  Centurion, who had been for a time one of his own subordinates.</p>

  <p>"What, Stertinius!" he cried, "don't you know any better than to mix
  yourself up in a brawl, if indeed it is not a robbery?"</p>

  <p>Stertinius, who, like his comrades, was not quite sober, and in his
  excitement had not recognized the newcomer, was taken aback at being thus
  addressed by his name. The next moment his memory returned to him.</p>

  <p>"Hold, friends!" he shouted to his companions; "it is the second in
  command of the pioneers."</p>

  <p>The men immediately released their victim, and falling into line, stood at
  attention, and saluted.</p>

  <p>Stertinius took it upon himself to be their spokesman: "We are very sorry
  to have annoyed one of your honour's friends, and hope that you and he will
  overlook the offence."</p>

  <p>"Begone!" cried Pudens, who had a feeling that it would be better for the
  freedman's sake not to take the affair too seriously. "Begone! and in future
  let your devotion to Bacchus, at least, be a little less fervent."</p>

  <p>When the men had disappeared the freedman explained to his protector what
  had happened.</p>

  <p>"But," asked Pudens, when he had heard the story, "what made the fellows
  behave in this fashion to you? I presume that they don't commonly go about
  compelling people to do reverence to wayside statues."</p>

  <p>Linus hesitated for a while before he replied to this question. "Sir," he
  said at last, "I will be frank with you. I won't ask you to keep secret what
  I tell you. You are not, I know, the man to betray a confidence; and,
  besides, there can hardly be any question of secrecy in this matter
  hereafter. These men have got hold of the notion that I do not worship the
  gods whom they worship. An ill- conditioned fellow, whom I once employed, and
  had to discharge for his laziness and dishonesty, told them something about
  me, and since then I have been very much annoyed by them."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand you," said Pudens, who was quite unused to hear it
  treated as a serious matter whether a man did or did not believe in the gods.
  He was conscious of not believing in them himself in any real sense of the
  words; but he went through the usual forms of respect to their images, would
  put, for instance, a portion of food before the household god, when he
  remembered it, and, equally when he remembered it, would salute a wayside
  Mercury or Terminus. "What do you believe in then? The Egyptian trio, or
  what?"</p>

  <p>Linus sank his voice to a whisper: "I am a Christian," he said.</p>

  <p>The word conveyed, it may be said, no meaning to the young soldier. He had
  heard it, and that was all. Subrius, he now remembered, had said, when he was
  about to introduce him to Pomponia, "A really good woman, though they do say
  that she is a Christian," but the remark had made no impression on him.</p>

  <p>"A Christian," he repeated. "What is that?"</p>

  <p>"No harm, certainly," Linus answered; "but, on the contrary, I hope much
  good. One thing I have learnt from it, that there is but one God in heaven
  and earth, and that all these gods, as they call them, are but vain things,
  or worse. But don't suppose," he went on, "that I go out of my way to insult
  what others hold in reverence. That I have not learnt to do. Only, when any
  one would compel me, as those drunken soldiers would have compelled me, to
  pay honour to the idols, as we call them, I cannot do it. 'Thou shalt not bow
  down to them nor worship them,' says my law, and I should be false and
  disobedient if I did. They say dreadful things about us, sir, I know, things
  that it would be a shame to repeat; but they are not true, believe me, sir,
  they are not true. I have done many wrong things in other days, but my dear
  Lord, who died for me, has delivered me from the curse of evil."</p>

  <p>He uttered these last words with a fervent earnestness which greatly
  impressed his hearer, though he had scarcely even the dimmest notion of what
  was meant. The young man, whose heart was touched and purified by an honest
  emotion which made the follies of the past seem hateful to him, was deeply
  interested and eager to hear more.</p>

  <p>In the course of the next few weeks many conversations on the subject
  followed. Linus at first expressed himself with much reserve. Already a
  bitter experience had taught the disciples the need of their Master's
  caution, that they were not to cast their pearls before swine. But the
  earnestness of the inquirer was so manifest, he was so unmistakably absorbed
  in what he heard, that the freedman soon told him all that he himself knew.
  He even permitted him to see what he held to be the choicest of all his
  possessions, a record of the Master's life. Pudens was half disposed to be
  disappointed when the treasure, kept, it was evident, with the most elaborate
  care,&mdash;for three caskets, each fastened with the most elaborate locks
  that the ingenuity of the age could devise, had to be opened before it could
  be seen,&mdash;proved to be a parchment volume of the very plainest kind.
  None of the customary ornaments of a book were there. The edges had been left
  in their native roughness; the knobs of the wooden pin, so to call it, round
  which the parchment had been rolled, were not painted, much less gilded. A
  bailiff's account-book or tradesman's ledger could not well have had a
  plainer exterior. But when Linus opened the volume and read some of its
  contents, there was no more disappointment. He made choice of what was most
  suitable to his listener with much care. If we had the book now in our hands
  we should not be able, it may be, actually to identify it with any one of the
  four Gospels which we now possess. Still, it is not impossible that it may
  have been an early draft of that which bears the name of St. Luke, the
  companion, it will be remembered, of the long imprisonment of St. Paul, and
  not unreasonably believed by many to have availed himself of this opportunity
  of putting together his "narrative concerning those matters which were fully
  established among" the early believers. If so, what could have been more
  appropriate for the needs of the inquirer than the story of the Prodigal's
  Return to his Father, of the Rich Man and the Beggar, of the Good Samaritan?
  As the reader went on to other passages less easy of comprehension, Pudens
  began to ask questions to which the freedman was not able to give a
  satisfactory answer. "He was unlearned and ignorant," he hastened to explain,
  "knowing and understanding enough to satisfy his own wants, but not competent
  to explain difficulties."</p>

  <p>"But you have teachers and wise men among you, I presume," said the young
  soldier." Why should I not go to them?"</p>

  <p>Linus hesitated. Circumstances had compelled him to put his own life in
  the young man's hands, for though there had been as yet no persecution, a man
  who owned himself to be a Christian felt himself to be doing as much as that.
  But to bring the lives of others into the same danger, to trust the safety of
  the little community to one who, a few weeks before, had been an absolute
  stranger, was another matter. And then the interests of the young man himself
  were to be considered. It was no light thing to suggest that he should openly
  associate with people of whom Rome, as far as it had heard anything at all
  about them, had the very worst opinion. Hence he had never proposed to his
  friend a visit to the Christian places of assembly, and when the young man
  himself had suggested it, he was conscious of no little perplexity. However,
  he had now gone too far to be able to draw back. If the young soldier had
  been trusted so far, he would have to be trusted altogether. Without making
  any further difficulty, Linus agreed to take his friend to an assembly that
  was to be held on the following day.</p>

  <p>The meeting-place was outside the city walls. It was the old club-house of
  a guild of artisans, disused partly because it had fallen into bad repair,
  partly because the burial-ground in which it stood, and which had much to do
  with its original purpose, had been filled up by interments. The guild had
  removed its quarters to larger and more commodious premises elsewhere, and
  had been glad to lease what was almost a valueless property to the
  representative of the Christian community, in this case no other than Linus
  himself. It was an oblong building with a semicircular end, something like
  that form of chancel which we know under the name of apse. The place was
  absolutely without ornament, though at the back of the seat which lined the
  apse were curtains of some very rough material. No religious symbol of any
  kind was visible. It was important that in case of any investigation nothing
  should be seen that could give the meeting the character of a secret society.
  Against secret societies the government of the Empire was then, as always,
  mercilessly severe.</p>

  <p>Pudens was not destined on that occasion to hear any such exposition of
  mysteries as he had been expecting from the authorized teachers to whom Linus
  had referred him. The community were intensely agitated by an unexpected blow
  which had suddenly fallen upon them. It had always, indeed, a certain
  consciousness of danger, for it was aware that it was undisturbed only
  because it was unknown; but some years had passed without any interference
  from the authorities, and a general feeling of security had been the result.
  This was now to be destroyed, and, indeed, till more than two centuries and a
  half had passed, was not to be known again by the Christian Church.</p>

  <p>A whispered introduction from Linus to the door-keeper was sufficient to
  secure the admission of Pudens. The building was nearly full, rather more
  than half the congregation being composed of slaves. The majority of the
  remainder were artisans, farmers, or small tradesmen, most of them showing by
  their features a Jewish origin. The sprinkling of men of higher rank was very
  small. Two wore a toga fringed with the narrow purple stripe that was the
  sign of equestrian rank. There were a few women, numbering, perhaps, a sixth
  part of the whole, who sat together on the hindermost benches.</p>

  <p>Just as Linus and Pudens entered, the presiding minister rose from the
  seat which he occupied by the wall of the apse with a paper in his hand. He
  came forward as far as the railing which separated the semicircle from the
  rest of the building, and after a brief salutation addressed the assembled
  congregation.</p>

  <p>"Brethren and sisters," he said, "a great danger threatens us. To-morrow,
  possibly to-day, if sufficient copies can be made, the edict which I am about
  to read to you will be published throughout Rome. Listen and judge for
  yourselves.</p>

  <p>" 'NERO CLAUDIUS CAESAR DRUSUS GERMANICUS AUGUSTUS IMPERATOR TO THE SENATE
  AND PEOPLE OF ROME, GREETING:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>" 'Whereas it has come to my knowledge as a certain fact that that most
  terrible disaster by which the city of Rome has lately been visited, to wit,
  the conflagration, which, raging continuously for many days and nights,
  destroyed not only the dwellings of men, but the most precious monuments of
  our ancestors and the very temples of the immortal gods, was brought about by
  the malice of certain abandoned persons, who have assumed to themselves the
  name of Christians, and who, inflamed with an insatiable hatred of the human
  race, conceived the idea of destroying this, its fairest and noblest seat, I
  hereby charge and command all men whatsoever, that they do forthwith give up
  to the magistrates, and to other persons whom I shall appoint for that
  purpose, the names of all, whether men, women, or children,&mdash;for this
  infection has not spared even the tenderest age,&mdash;whom they know or
  suspect to be poisoned with this detestable superstition. And I hereby
  declare that such as shall be found guilty of this wickedness shall forthwith
  be visited with the most condign punishment. Farewell.' "</i></p>

  <p>The dismay which followed the reading of this document defies description.
  Of petty social persecution the Christians knew something; they had suffered
  also from one or two outbreaks of mob violence; already their heathen
  neighbours had begun to connect them with dear food and unhealthy seasons, as
  cause and effect; but this formal arraignment of them as men who had
  inflicted on their fellow-citizens the most frightful of sufferings, was an
  unprecedented and wholly overwhelming experience.</p>

  <p>After a short pause the minister spoke again. "Brethren and sisters," he
  said in a voice whose calm and measured accents contrasted strangely with the
  excitement of his audience: "We do not now for the first time learn the truth
  of the Master's words, 'They shall accuse you falsely for My name's sake.'
  Yet I must confess that this charge, so monstrous in itself, and so far
  reaching in its application, exceeds the very worst that we could have
  feared. And now what shall I say to you? Great, indeed, is this tribulation,
  but the grace of Him who loved you and gave Himself for you is more than
  sufficient. It may be that He will deliver you even now from the mouth of the
  lion, even as he delivered our holy brother Paul from it not many months ago;
  but if not"&mdash;the speaker paused awhile, and then raising his voice went
  on with the world-famous defiance of the dauntless three to the Chaldaean
  tyrant&mdash;"if not, be it known unto thee, O King, that we will not serve
  the golden image which thou hast set up."</p>

  <p>The bold utterance met with an immediate response from the congregation. A
  subdued murmur of approval went round, and every head was lifted higher.</p>

  <p>The speaker went on: "But it is not so much to courage as to caution that
  I would at this moment exhort you. If it may be, do the Master's bidding when
  he said, 'If they persecute you in one city, flee ye to another.' If you must
  needs stay in Rome, be not overbold. Confess your faith, if you are called,
  but do not flaunt it in the faces of the persecutors. The Lord will support
  you in trials to which He brings you, not in those that you find for
  yourselves. Let us pray for His grace that we may be found faithful even unto
  death."</p>

  <p>The whole congregation fell upon their knees and prayed in a silence that
  was only broken by some deep sob that could not be controlled. At last the
  minister rose, and stretching out his hands over his people, committed them
  with words of blessing to the Divine protection.</p>

  <p>"How is it that your chief became possessed of that document so soon?"
  asked Pudens of his companion.</p>

  <p>Linus smiled. "We have always had friends in Cæsar's household. It will
  not avail much now, I fear, but it at least gives us time to think."</p>

  <p>"You will flee, of course," resumed the young man.</p>

  <p>"Impossible," replied his companion. "I have a bedridden sister, and my
  place is with her. But let us hope that no one saw you to-day among us, no
  one, at least, who should not have seen you."</p>

  <p>"But have you traitors among you?"</p>

  <p>"Who has not? Do you not remember that the Master Himself had one in His
  own small company of twelve? But anyhow we must part; you must not be seen
  with me."</p>

  <p>Pudens saw the prudence of this advice, and could not refuse to follow it.
  He wrung his new friend's hand, and with a fervent prayer, "Your Master keep
  you!" turned away.</p>

  <p>For his own safety he had little fear. He could truly say that he was not
  a Christian, though he was conscious of a strange feeling that there would be
  something shameful about such a denial. The next moment he had forgotten all
  about himself. A thought had shot across his mind that made his blood run
  cold. What would be the fate of Pomponia? And if she was arrested,&mdash;and
  that she had a deadly enemy in Poppæa he knew,&mdash;how would it fare with
  Claudia?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13"></a>XIII. &mdash; IN HIDING</h2>

  <p class="first">THE situation with which the young soldier found himself
  compelled to deal was one of great difficulty. Subrius' country house had
  been a sufficient shelter for the two ladies as long as it was only illegal
  violence on the part of Poppæa that they had to fear. But the case would be
  different when a regular proscription, in which they would certainly be
  included, had been ordered. The little fort-like house might resist a coup de
  main such as had been attempted at Pomponia's mansion, but it would have to
  open its gates at a summons from the Imperial authority, and that the
  Imperial authority would be invoked, and invoked without delay, by the
  animosity of Poppæa, could not be doubted for a moment. If resistance was
  impossible, what remained? Nothing but flight, and flight from a power which
  embraced, or in the view of a Roman seemed to embrace, the whole of the
  habitable world, was notoriously impossible.</p>

  <p>There was a third alternative&mdash;concealment. Could that be contrived?
  Possibly; but where? Obviously under ordinary circumstances in Rome itself,
  for there is no hiding-place so safe as a crowded city. But then Rome, of
  which a third lay still in ruins from the fire, and another third was in
  process of rebuilding, was certainly not as suitable for the purpose as
  usual.</p>

  <p>Suddenly an idea struck him. There was a certain grotesqueness about it
  which made him laugh in spite of the gravity of the situation. A little
  consideration showed him that this very grotesqueness was no small
  recommendation. His foster- mother was the wife of a temple servant who had
  the charge of a temple dedicated to one of the minor deities with which the
  Roman Pantheon was crowded. The temple itself, which had stood near the
  Circus, had perished in the fire, but the residence, which was at a
  considerable distance, had escaped, and as it did not come within the area of
  the projected improvements of the city, was not likely to be disturbed. It
  was here, then, that Pudens fancied he could find a fairly safe hiding-place
  for the two ladies. In his foster- mother's fidelity and devotion to him he
  could implicitly trust. Childless herself,&mdash;for she had lost all her
  offspring in their infancy,&mdash;she lavished all her mother's love upon her
  foster- child. Nothing that he could do was wrong in her eyes. She would
  give, he was sure, an asylum to the worst of criminals, if only he came with
  a recommendation from him. Her husband was an easy, good- natured man,
  accustomed to follow without a question the guidance of his wife, and not
  more zealous for the honour of the deity whom he served, than those who were
  behind the scenes of any temple commonly were.</p>

  <p>Pudens' idea was to tell the wife the truth about her inmates, and to
  leave it to her to decide how much she would communicate to her husband.
  There was no time to be lost. He had one day before him, but no more. The
  Christian assembly had been held as usual in the very early morning, and it
  still wanted several hours to noon. All arrangements would have to be made
  before sunset; as soon as it was dark the ladies must leave their present
  abode, and they would have to be in their new asylum before the next
  morning.</p>

  <p>The first thing to be done was to provide the shelter. Pudens made the
  best of his way to his foster-mother's house, and was lucky enough to find
  her before she went out to make her daily purchases in the market.</p>

  <p>The good woman's astonishment when she heard the errand on which he had
  come was great. She had just heard of the Christians, but had the very
  vaguest ideas as to what they were. These ideas naturally reflected the
  popular prejudices.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she said, "we will do anything that we can." Like the wise
  woman that she was, she always associated her husband with herself as far as
  words went. "We will do anything that we can for friends of yours; but I have
  heard that these Christians are very wicked people."</p>

  <p>"Wicked, mother!" cried the young man; "these are two of the best women
  that ever lived."</p>

  <p>"But why does the Emperor want to harm them, then?"</p>

  <p>"Need you ask, mother, when you have such a woman as Poppæa stirring him
  up to all kinds of wickedness?"</p>

  <p>There was still such a prestige about the Emperor that it was still the
  custom, at least in speaking, whatever the real belief may have been, to
  attribute his misdoings to bad advisers.</p>

  <p>Statia&mdash;this was the foster-mother's name&mdash;had all the dislike
  that a good woman would be likely to feel for Poppæa, while she had a certain
  weakness for the handsome young Emperor, of whom she was ready to believe as
  much good and as little evil as the utmost stretch of charity would
  allow.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she cried; "so it is one of that mischievous woman's doings."</p>

  <p>"And how about your husband?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it will be all right with him. I shall tell him that the ladies are
  people whom Poppæa hates. That will be enough for him. He thinks as ill of
  her as I do. You see it was Otho, her first&mdash;no, I am wrong, her second
  husband, that got him his present place, and he thinks that she has treated
  him very badly."</p>

  <p>This matter satisfactorily settled, the next thing was to provide for the
  safe conveyance of the fugitives from the one place to the other. Here Pudens
  found himself face to face with a huge difficulty. The litter in which they
  had journeyed from Rome was out of the question. A secret known to eight
  bearers would hardly be a secret long. The younger woman would certainly be
  able to ride, and possibly to walk, for the distance was not beyond the
  strength of an active girl. The elder would as certainly be incapable of
  either exertion.</p>

  <p>"What is to be done, Statia?" he asked, after turning the matter over for
  some time in his own mind.</p>

  <p>For a time the good woman was utterly perplexed. At last an idea occurred
  to her.</p>

  <p>"The ladies will come as early as possible to-morrow," she said. "That is
  your plan, is it not?"</p>

  <p>"Just so," replied the young man.</p>

  <p>"When the market carts come in from the country."</p>

  <p>"Exactly."</p>

  <p>"Then they must come in a market cart."</p>

  <p>"Admirably thought of, mother; but how about the cart?"</p>

  <p>"My brother Marcus, who has a farm for vegetables in the suburbs, will
  lend me one. I shall tell him that I am borrowing it for a friend who is
  moving her goods into the city. You will have to act the wagoner."</p>

  <p>"That I can manage easily enough. It is not the first time that I have
  done it."</p>

  <p>It had been a favourite frolic with Pudens, in his somewhat turbulent
  youth, to seek adventures in the disguise of a countryman. He had still the
  rough smock frock and leggings laid up somewhere in his house.</p>

  <p>"I shall go to my brother this afternoon, and make everything ready for
  you. You must come dressed as a wagoner; and mind, you must not have the
  dress only, but the speech also. Can you manage this? Let me hear you
  try."</p>

  <p>Pudens gave so excellent an imitation of rustic speech that the woman
  burst out laughing. "That will do," she cried; "nothing could be better."</p>

  <p>Shortly after noon Pudens might have been seen starting from his house. He
  was on horseback, and was apparently bound on a journey, for he carried
  behind him a travelling valise. It contained, besides his own disguise, two
  plain cloaks, such as the country women commonly wore when they came into
  Rome; these were intended for the use of the two ladies. When he had got
  about six miles from the city, he dismounted, concealed the valise in a
  little wood by the wayside, and then mounting again, rode on to a little inn,
  a haunt of his earlier days, where he was consequently well known, and where
  no questions would be asked, and scarcely any curiosity felt about his
  proceedings. Here he put up his horse; and then, retracing his steps to the
  wood, assumed the wagoner's dress. Pudens had a certain genius for acting,
  and no one would have recognized the elegant and fashionable young soldier in
  the middle-aged, slouching countryman, a rustic of the rustics, as any one
  would have thought him, who plodded along the road in the direction of the
  farm where he was to find the vehicle.</p>

  <p>Everything went well. Statia had been better than her word. She had
  induced her brother to provide a covered wagon, as being far more convenient
  for the purpose than a common cart. It was drawn by a couple of horses, about
  whose welfare the farmer gave many cautions to the supposed wagoner. "My
  sister tells me," he said, "that you are a careful man, who knows how to
  treat a good beast as he deserves. Don't you overdrive the poor creatures; be
  gentle with them up the hills if you have much of a load; see with your own
  eyes that they get their food when you put them up at the tavern&mdash;you
  know the place, the Ph&oelig;nix, just outside the gate; an honest place
  enough, but hostlers will have their little tricks everywhere."</p>

  <p>Pudens, who had commended himself to the farmer by some judicious praise
  of his animals, promised to take all imaginable care of wagon and horses, and
  had the satisfaction of getting away, without exciting, as he hoped, the
  slightest suspicion as to his real character. His promise, however, did not
  prevent him from putting the animals to a sharp trot, that would probably
  have struck dismay into their owner's heart, as soon as he was well out of
  sight of the farm. Time, indeed, was precious. He had to reach the old fort,
  to tell his story, to persuade the ladies to follow his advice, itself
  likely, he fancied, to be a task of some difficulty, and to get back to Rome
  before sunrise the next day.</p>

  <p>The sun was just setting when he reached the fort. Tying up the horses to
  a tree he approached the building, knocked, or to speak more accurately,
  kicked at the door, and asked for the old steward. The old man came to the
  door, expecting to be interviewed on some ordinary business, and of course
  failed to recognize his visitor, whom, indeed, he had seen once only in his
  natural semblance. Pudens intimated that his business was of a private kind,
  and on finding himself alone with the steward revealed his name, recalling to
  the old man's recollection the occasion on which they had met before. Nothing
  could exceed his astonishment. But when the soldier went on to unfold his
  errand, describing the imminent danger in which Pomponia and her young
  companion were placed, and the scheme by which he hoped to rescue them, the
  old man became cool and practical at once.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "there is a hope that you may succeed; but the first
  difficulty will be to persuade my lady. Her own inclination would be to stay
  here and face the danger, whatever it was."</p>

  <p>"Shall I see her?"</p>

  <p>"Not, I should say, before I have told her the story. The affair is enough
  to confound any one, much more a woman who has lived out of the world for
  many years, and it must be broken to her."</p>

  <p>"Very good; arrange it as you think best. But remember that there is no
  time to be lost. I should be starting in an hour at the most, if I am to get
  to Rome before sunrise to-morrow, and I ought not to be later."</p>

  <p>The old man hastened away at once to seek an interview with Pomponia. In
  about half an hour he returned.</p>

  <p>"Come with me," he said. "My lady wishes to speak with you."</p>

  <p>Pudens followed him to a room where the two ladies were sitting together.
  Ushered into their presence, he felt, and was ashamed of feeling, somewhat
  embarrassed by the consciousness of a ludicrous disguise, all the more when
  he perceived that Claudia, notwithstanding the gravity of the situation,
  could not resist a little smile.</p>

  <p>"You have my thanks," began Pomponia, "for all the trouble that you have
  taken and the risk that you have run. But I must confess that I would sooner
  await here whatever God may please to send."</p>

  <p>The steward broke in with the freedom of speech often accorded to, or at
  least assumed by, an old servant.</p>

  <p>"Madam, if I may be permitted to say so much, there spoke the wife of a
  Roman Consular rather than the handmaid of Christ."</p>

  <p>Pomponia flushed at the rebuke, but answered gently, "How so? I would not
  willingly forget my duty."</p>

  <p>"Madam," went on the old man, "it seems to me that what God has sent, as
  far as we can see at present, is this young man. He comes with a well
  contrived scheme which he has taken much pains to carry out so far. But
  because it does not suit your dignity to fly from your enemies, or to put on
  a disguise, you refuse to avail yourself of it. Did the blessed Paul think it
  below his dignity to be let down in a basket out of a window in the wall of
  Damascus? Not so; he took the means of deliverance that God sent him, and did
  not wait for something else that might be more to his taste. And let me say
  again, madam, what I have said before. You may think it right for yourself to
  stop here and face the enemy; but you have no right to involve others, this
  dear young lady for instance, with you. She is young; she is new in the
  faith,&mdash;she will pardon an old man for speaking his mind,&mdash;and she
  may not have your strength when she is brought to the fiery trial. Nay,
  madam,"&mdash;he hesitated a moment before he uttered words that might imply
  possible doubt of his mistress' own courage and endurance,&mdash;"Nay, madam,
  who knows but what your own strength may fail, if you persist in trying it in
  a place to which you are not called."</p>

  <p>The last two arguments affected Pomponia powerfully. What if this were a
  call? It would be a sin if she did not follow it, for herself and her young
  companion.</p>

  <p>"Phlegon is right," she said after a short pause; "we will do as you think
  best."</p>

  <p>It was arranged that the two female attendants who had accompanied the
  visitors should remain where they were. It was difficult, if not impossible,
  otherwise to dispose of them. Probably they would escape unmolested, passing
  as part of the small establishment which the owner of the house was
  accustomed to maintain. Phlegon would find shelter with friends in Rome, and
  would keep up, if possible, some communication with his mistress.</p>

  <p>It is needless to describe the journey to Rome. It was affected without
  any difficulty; but one incident that occurred in the course of it proved how
  narrow an escape the fugitives had had. When about half the distance had been
  traversed, Pudens halted at a wayside inn to rest and bait the horses. At the
  very moment that he did so, a party of horse soldiers which was travelling
  the other way drew up before the door of the hostelry. It consisted of two
  troops, numbering together about sixty men, and was commanded by an officer
  of some rank, who was accompanied by a civilian. Pudens guessed their errand
  in a moment. They had come, he was sure, to arrest Pomponia, and it was quite
  possible that they might insist on searching the wagon. Boldness, he felt,
  was the only policy. Any attempt to escape would certainly be fatal. He came
  forward, made a clumsy salutation to the officer in command, and began to
  converse with some of the troopers. He ordered a flagon of the coarse wine of
  the country, and shared it with the newcomers. The liquor set the men's
  tongues wagging, and Pudens soon learnt that his suspicions were correct.
  They were bound, said one of the men, for an old country house to arrest some
  prisoners.</p>

  <p>"Who are they? What have they done?" asked the supposed wagoner.</p>

  <p>"By Bacchus!" cried the man; "I know nothing about it. I heard something
  about their being Christians, whatever that may mean. All that I can tell you
  is that it is some affair of Poppæa. You see that fat man by our chief's
  side? He has had a bad time of it, I fancy. He is not used to riding, I take
  it, and we have been pushing on at a good rate. Well, he is one of Poppæa's
  freedmen. That fellow there," he pointed as he spoke to a slave who was
  evidently in charge of a couple of troopers," is our guide. He knows, it
  seems, where the parties whom we want are, and was to have a turn on the
  'little horse' if he didn't tell."</p>

  <p>This, Pudens imagined, must be some poor wretch belonging to Pomponia's
  household in Rome, who had been unlucky enough to overhear the name of the
  place where his mistress was to find shelter.</p>

  <p>The easy bearing of Pudens had exactly the effect which he hoped from it,
  while the accident of the two parties meeting at the halting-place was all in
  favour of his escape. Probably, had the soldiers encountered him on the road,
  they would have challenged him, and overhauled the contents of his wagon. As
  matters turned out, the idea never occurred either to the officer in command
  or to any of his men. He acted his part so thoroughly well, that no notion of
  his being anything more than a countryman on his way to the Roman market with
  a load of produce, crossed any one's mind. Anxious to avoid the remotest
  cause of suspicion, he purposely prolonged his halt, though, it need not be
  said, intensely anxious to be off, till the soldiers had started again. It
  was with intense relief that he heard the officer in command give the order
  to mount. When the last of the troopers had disappeared in the darkness, he
  climbed to the driver's seat, tossed the hostler his fee,&mdash;which he was
  careful not to make the smallest fraction larger than usual,&mdash;and set
  his horses in motion. The two women, who had sat all this time under the
  covering of the wagon, hand clasped in hand, in a perfect agony of suspense,
  breathed a fervent thanksgiving when they felt themselves to be once more
  upon the way.</p>

  <p>Nothing else happened to alarm the travellers during the rest of their
  journey; but the most critical time was yet to come. While they were still
  out of sight of the inn where the wagon and horses were to be put up, the two
  ladies alighted. Each was disguised beyond recognition, Pudens hoped, in the
  coarse cloaks usually worn by the market-women when they travelled by night,
  and each carried a large basket filled, or apparently filled, with goods that
  they were about to offer for sale. At the inn, of course, the wagon and the
  horses were well known, but Pudens, as a stranger, excited some
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, in answer to some question, "old Caius has a touch of
  fever,"&mdash;he had taken the precaution of ascertaining the name of the man
  whom the farmer usually employed,&mdash;"and I am taking his place. It is not
  to my liking at all," he went on; "I had sooner be in my bed, by a long
  way."</p>

  <p>At the city gate the porter grumbled a little at being roused so early,
  but asked no questions. Catching a glimpse of Claudia's beautiful face, he
  paid the girl a rough compliment which made her shiver with fear and disgust.
  Pudens would have dearly liked to knock the fellow down, but, anxious above
  all things to avoid a scene, restrained himself.</p>

  <p>"Hold your tongue," he growled to the man in the harshest country accent
  that he could put on, "and leave her alone. She is not your sort."</p>

  <p>"Nor yours, either," retorted the man; "for a rougher bumpkin I never
  saw."</p>

  <p>The "bumpkin," however, he perceived to be unusually tall and stout, and
  one who would be a formidable fellow to quarrel with. He returned into the
  gate- house, and the party passed on without further molestation. The streets
  were almost deserted, so early was the hour. Beyond one or two late revellers
  staggering home, and a few workmen engaged in some occupation that had to be
  begun betimes, no one met them. When they reached the temple servant's door
  where Statia was waiting to receive her new inmates, they had escaped, so
  Pudens had good reason to hope, all hostile observation.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE PERSECUTION</h2>

  <p class="first">THE streets were beginning to fill as Pudens made the best
  of his way from the temple servant's dwelling to his own house. Fortunately
  for him, as he naturally wished to escape notice, the attention of the
  passers-by was engrossed by the copies of the edict against the Christians,
  which the Imperial officers were now busy posting up in all the public places
  of the city. He was thus able to reach his home without attracting any
  observation. Once there, he hastened to put away his disguise in the safest
  hiding-place that he could find. The proceedings of the night he proposed to
  keep for as long as possible an absolute secret. The most honourable of men,
  he reflected, are less likely to divulge what they do not know than what they
  do.</p>

  <p>A veritable reign of terror now began in Rome. In the course of a few days
  the prisons were crowded to overflowing. It was, indeed, a strange and medley
  multitude with which they were filled. The first victims were the more
  prominent members of the Christian congregations that were scattered
  throughout the city. Many of these were Jews who had separated themselves, or
  rather had been expelled, from the synagogues. Their names were naturally
  known to their unbelieving countrymen, who regarded them with a hatred that
  was peculiarly intense, and who eagerly seized the opportunity of wreaking
  their vengeance upon them. Accordingly, the officers charged with the
  execution of the decree were supplied by the rulers of the synagogues with
  lists of Jews, who, as they said, had abandoned the faith of their fathers to
  adopt a gloomy and odious superstition. These, then, were the first that were
  arrested under the terms of the Imperial decree. Next came a great number of
  persons who were more or less closely connected with the new faith. The
  Christian meetings had been conducted with as little ostentation as possible,
  but they had not passed unnoticed, and many were arrested because they had
  been known to attend them. Some of these had frequented the meetings from no
  other motive than curiosity, and these, finding themselves involved in what
  seemed to be a formidable danger, hastened to win the favour of the
  authorities by informing against others. So far the prisoners were either
  genuine Christians, or, at least, had been seen to consort with them. But
  mingled with these were others who had really nothing to do with the matter:
  persons who were suspected, in some cases, it may be, with reason, in many
  more, we may be certain, without any ground whatsoever, of having caused or
  spread the late fire, were seized and accused. In this way private grudges
  were often gratified. A creditor or a rival could be got rid of, and that
  with very little difficulty, if he happened to be unpopular, by a whisper
  dropped into the right place. Altogether it was a strange crowd that was thus
  swept as it were by a net into the prisons out of the streets of Rome.</p>

  <p>Among the prisoners was the gladiator, or rather ex-gladiator, Fannius. He
  had made the acquaintance of Glaucon, a young man belonging to Pomponia's
  household, who, when that lady was obliged to leave Rome, had been given some
  employment by her nephew, Lateranus. Glaucon was a native of Cyprus, had been
  employed there by the Proconsul Sergius Paulus, and had witnessed the
  memorable scene in which the Apostle Paul had confounded the hostile
  sorcerer, and convinced the Proconsul of the truth of his message. When
  Paulus, on the expiration of his term of office, returned to Rome, he took
  Glaucon with him, and not long after recommended him to a situation of trust
  in the household of Pomponia. Glaucon was a fervent Christian, and he did not
  fail to use the opportunities of commending his faith to his new
  acquaintance. Fannius was just in the mood to listen with eagerness to his
  teaching. For some years past life had been a very serious affair to him, and
  all the more so because there was so much in his surroundings as an inmate of
  a "school" of gladiators that was hateful to him. His brutal comrades, whose
  sole virtue, it may be said, was courage, and who followed with a revolting
  simplicity the maxim of "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die," set off
  by contrast this refined and pure- minded young Greek, who seemed moved by
  springs of action belonging to quite another world. Such an act of filial
  devotion as had brought Fannius into his present position, unfavourable to
  goodness as this may have been in itself, could not fail to elevate his
  character, while another purifying influence had been his faithful attachment
  to Epicharis. In the course of a few weeks, though not knowing enough to fit
  him for baptism, which indeed he could hardly have received while still a
  gladiator, Fannius was at heart a Christian.</p>

  <p>And now occurred a difficulty of the most serious kind. The performance
  which Nero exhibited after the fire was the last in which Fannius would have
  to appear. Did he survive this, he would be entitled to his discharge. But
  could he consent to appear? Would the principles of his new faith permit him
  to exhibit his prowess in the arena? That he could not engage in combat with
  one of his fellow-men was perfectly plain. That would be a manifest breach of
  an elementary law of morals. The question was, could he take any part in the
  spectacle? Opinions were divided. Advisers of the severer sort declared
  against any participation; others were content with saying that he must do
  nothing that would endanger human life. This was the course which he
  followed. He went to the trainer, and declared, without giving his reasons,
  that he would not fight except against wild beasts. At first the man was
  furious. Fannius was, as has been said, a remarkably skilful swords-man, and
  his dexterity and force made him perhaps the most popular performer in the
  whole school; all this would be thrown away if he were matched with a lion or
  a tiger.</p>

  <p>"What!" cried the man; "you, my best fighter! I am not going to waste you
  in such a shameful way."</p>

  <p>"There is no help for it," replied Fannius. "Set me to fight against a
  gladiator, and I shall simply drop my arms. Against a beast I will do my
  best."</p>

  <p>And there was no help for it. The trainer had to make the best of it. He
  even consoled himself with the idea that he should be able to present a
  novelty to the spectators. Commonly it was a condemned criminal that had to
  combat with a wild beast, and it was very seldom that these wretched
  creatures made any real resistance. They were usually without skill in arms
  or physical strength; and they were terrified into helplessness. A practised
  gladiator of the very first class engaging in one of these desperate
  combats&mdash;and a struggle with a lion or tiger at close quarters was then,
  as it would be now without the help of fire- arms, well nigh
  desperate&mdash;might have a great success. At the same time, as Fannius'
  time of engagement was up, there was no risk. If he was killed there would be
  no loss; if he survived there would be the credit of having provided a novel
  and exciting entertainment.</p>

  <p>So it was arranged. After a number of pairs of gladiators had fought
  without any particularly brilliant result, the herald came forward, and made
  the following announcement, permission having been first obtained from the
  presiding authorities. Fannius, it should be said, had nothing to do with the
  terms in which it was made.</p>

  <p>"C. Fannius, having fought many times with men, and having as often
  secured victory, claims permission to fight with more formidable antagonists.
  He will, therefore, with the help of certain associates who have been
  allotted to him for this purpose, contend with a lion, a lioness, and a
  bear."</p>

  <p>The "associates" were criminals who would in any case have had to undergo
  the ordeal.</p>

  <p>The combat that followed proved to be a success, at least from the point
  of view of a Roman sight-seer. To us it would have seemed a peculiarly brutal
  exhibition. The result was that the lioness and the bear were killed,
  Fannius' companions perishing in the struggle. Fannius, in fact, dispatched
  both animals while they were mangling the dead. A fierce conflict with the
  lion ended in the victory of the gladiator; though sadly mangled by the claws
  and teeth of his savage antagonist, he escaped with his life, and, of course,
  received his discharge, together with a handsome present from the Emperor. He
  was taken down to the farm, and nursed with indefatigable patience and care
  by Epicharis and her aunt. The girl's heart was softened as she tended her
  suffering lover, and she consented to become formally betrothed to him,
  though only on the condition that before their marriage the vengeance for
  which she lived should have been first exacted.</p>

         title="Fannius and the lion.">

    <p class="caption">Fannius and the lion.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>It was in the midst of the joy and pride which he felt in securing an
  affection of which he had begun to despair, that Fannius imparted to
  Epicharis the secret of the conspiracy, the secret into which he had been
  himself initiated by Subrius. The matter had been left to his discretion by
  his superior, and he thought himself justified in what he did, by the belief,
  perfectly well founded, as we shall see, that he could not have secured a
  more zealous or more loyal associate. On her part the girl was almost frantic
  with delight. An object which had seemed almost unattainable was now within
  reach. It was not a weak woman; it was a powerful association of great nobles
  and great soldiers that had vowed vengeance against the tyrant. At the same
  time the love, for which hitherto there had scarcely been room in her heart
  by the side of the engrossing passion for vengeance, grew up and flourished
  apace. Before cold and distant, she now lavished upon her lover an affection
  which astonished as much as it delighted him.</p>

  <p>Then the blow fell. To the trainer the conduct of Fannius in choosing to
  fight with beasts rather than men had been unintelligible. If he guessed at
  any motive he would have said that it was a desire for notoriety. But a rival
  gladiator, who conceived himself to be affronted by the terms of the
  proclamation, which indeed, though, as had been said, not through any fault
  of Fannius, had a certain arrogance about them&mdash;was more acute. He knew
  something about Fannius, and was sure that he would not have committed
  himself to a desperate venture without some motive of solid worth. Fannius,
  he was sure, had every reason for wanting to live, and there must be some
  grave reason for his thus risking his life. What could it be but the same
  motive which prevented these gloomy sectaries, the Christians, from ever
  enjoying the spectacles of the Circus and the amphitheatre. On the strength
  of this conjecture he informed against Fannius as belonging to the forbidden
  sect of the Christians. The young man, who had now entirely recovered his
  health, came to Rome for the first time after his illness on the very day on
  which the edict was published, and was promptly arrested and thrown into
  prison.</p>

  <p>Another of the prisoners was Phlegon, Pomponia's steward. He had been
  arrested at Subrius' country house. Whether the soldiers arrived before he
  expected them, or whether he deliberately lingered because he knew that they
  would not be satisfied without making some arrest, it is not easy to say. Two
  slaves belonging to the household were seized along with him. Both, it so
  happened, were heathen, and were therefore in no danger; and he had the
  satisfaction of knowing, on the other hand, that the two women servants, left
  behind by Pomponia and Claudia, contrived to escape the notice of the
  soldiers. To his own peril, now that it had come to him in the way of duty,
  he was wholly indifferent. He had long since counted the cost of his
  Christian profession, and had resolved to pay it.</p>

  <p>The authorities were seriously perplexed by the abundance of prey which
  they secured. They did not know where to lodge their prisoners. It must be
  remembered that the Romans did not habitually use imprisonment, after
  conviction, as a punishment. Commonly the criminal, if he was not executed,
  was banished. Sometimes he was consigned to the safe keeping of some
  distinguished person, or was kept in his own house; but the long-continued
  imprisonment with which it is now customary to visit serious offences was
  unknown. Nero resolved to cut the knot of this difficulty in his own fashion.
  To the guilt or innocence of the prisoners he was absolutely indifferent.
  That they had nothing to do with the particular crime with which they were
  charged he had the best means of knowing; as to their offence in being
  Christians, he knew and cared nothing. What he did want was to shift upon
  them the notoriety which he wanted to divert from himself.</p>

  <p>One means of doing this would be by the singularity of the punishment to
  be inflicted on them. To make a conspicuous example of some, and to permit
  the rest to escape, was the course which commended itself to him. How he
  succeeded will now have to be told.</p>

  <p>During the two centuries and a half during which the Christian Church had
  to endure from time to time the hostility of the rulers of Rome, there were
  many persecutions that reached further, that lasted longer, that were in many
  ways more fatal; but there was not one that left on the minds of men so deep
  an impression of horror.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15"></a>XV. &mdash; WHAT THE TEMPLE SERVANT SAW</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was of course impossible that Pomponia and her young
  companion should remain in ignorance of what was going on in Rome. That
  something like a reign of terror prevailed, that multitudes of men, women,
  and even children were being daily arrested and imprisoned&mdash;no one
  exactly knew on what charge&mdash;they heard from their hostess, who,
  however, did her best to soften the story which she had to tell. But there
  came a time when they had to hear a tale which transcended in horror all that
  they could have imagined possible.</p>

  <p>Commonly the temple servant's house was remarkably quiet. The old man was
  a peace-loving personage, who seldom entertained others, and still more
  seldom went out. The dwelling was so small that the apartment occupied by the
  ladies could hardly be said to be out of hearing of that where Statia and her
  husband sat in the evening. Commonly there was silence, the woman being busy
  with her needle, the old man sleeping in his chair. Now and then there would
  be heard a gentle murmur of conversation. Once or twice the ladies could
  distinguish a third voice, which they supposed to be that of an occasional
  visitor. One night, however, after they had been in their refuge about a
  month, they could not help overhearing what seemed to be a very loud and
  animated discussion. Fragments of talk even reached their ears, and though
  they did not attempt to piece them together, the words they heard left a
  general impression of uneasiness and even fear in their minds. The next
  morning their hostess was in an evident condition of agitation and
  excitement, divided between eagerness to tell her news, and a kind-hearted
  desire not to give pain to her guests.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my lady!" she burst out, "there were terrible doings last night; such
  as were never heard of, they say, in Rome before, ever since it was a
  city."</p>

  <p>The two women listened in silent dismay. That the storm which had been
  gathering would soon burst, they had clearly foreseen; in what terrible form
  its violence would break forth, with such a creature, permitted by God to
  plague the world for its sins, who could tell?</p>

  <p>"I did not see them myself," Statia went on, "thanks be to the gods! But
  my husband did, and he was fairly sick and faint with the horribleness of the
  whole business when he came home. You see, he is not one that goes out much
  to sights. I haven't known him go to the Circus or the amphitheatre as much
  as once in the last ten years. You see, he would sooner stop at home quiet
  with me; and the best place, too, for an old man; aye! and for a young one,
  too, in my judgment. But last night a friend of his that serves the same
  temple would have him go and see some fine show, as he called it. The
  Emperor, my husband's friend said, was to throw open his gardens to the
  people, and there were to be such wonderful sights as had never been seen
  before. Well, my good man goes; and as I said, he comes home before it was
  over, quite sick with what he had seen. As soon as he was inside the gardens,
  he found a crowd of people hurrying to the theatre that there is in the
  gardens. Naturally he goes with them, and finds himself in a good place in
  front, where he could see all that was going on. In the arena were a number
  of animals,&mdash;bears, and lions, and tigers, and bisons, and other
  creatures that he did not know the names of,&mdash;at least, that was what he
  thought at first; but when he looked again he thought that there was
  something curious about them, they looked so awkward and clumsy. 'What ails
  the beasts?' he said to his next neighbour. The man laughed. 'They are not
  beasts at all!' he said; 'they are men!' 'Then what do they dress them up
  like that for?' asks my husband. 'Wait a moment,' says the other, 'and you
  will see.' And sure enough he did see. Some doors under the seats were
  opened, and a whole pack of dogs came leaping out&mdash;the biggest and
  fiercest looking dogs, my husband said, that he had ever seen. 'They've kept
  them hungry on purpose,' said the other man, 'giving them nothing to eat for
  two days, I am told.' 'But who are the poor creatures?' asked my husband,
  'and what have they done?' 'Who are they?' answered the other, 'why, they are
  Christians, to be sure, whatever that may mean, for I don't rightly know
  myself; and 'tis said that it is they who set the city on fire.' "</p>

  <p>"Hush!" cried Claudia, when Statia had reached this point in her story.
  "Tell us no more; it is more than my dear mother can bear."</p>

  <p>And indeed Pomponia had grown paler and paler as the story went on.</p>

  <p>"Nay," said Pomponia. "If our brethren actually endure these things, we
  may at least bear to hear them. Go on, my friend."</p>

  <p>"Well, my lady," Statia resumed, "the poor creatures were not as much
  injured as one would have expected. Many of the dogs, when they found out
  that it was not real beasts that they were set to attack, left them alone;
  some were even quite friendly and gentle with them. 'They seemed to me,' says
  my husband, 'a great deal better than their masters;' and right he was, as
  you will say, when you hear what happened next. A herald came forward and
  cried, 'Fathers, knights, and citizens of Rome, the Emperor invites you to
  the Circus to witness a chariot-race, and hopes that you will regard with
  indulgence any deficiency of skill that you may perceive in the charioteers.'
  'They say that he is going to drive one of the chariots himself, and
  Lateranus, who is to be Consul next year, the other,'&mdash;so my husband's
  neighbour, who seemed to know all about the show, told him. Of course it was
  very condescending of him to amuse the people in this way, but it does not
  seem to me quite the right thing for an Emperor.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>"Well, by this time it was getting dark, and when my husband got outside
  the theatre, he found the gardens lighted up. All along the walks, on each of
  the lamp-posts, they had fastened a man,&mdash;yes, it is true as I am
  alive,&mdash;a man, dressed in a tunic steeped in pitch, and with an iron
  collar under the chin to keep the head up,&mdash;fastened them, and set them
  on fire. That was too much for my husband. He declared that he could stay no
  longer, and indeed, he was so poorly that his friend had to see him home,
  though he was sorry, he said, not to see the rest of the show. When they got
  back he and my husband had a great argument about it,&mdash;perhaps you may
  have heard them, my lady, for they talked very loud. My husband's friend
  would have it that it was only right. They were Christians, he said, which
  was only another name for atheists, and richly deserved all they got. But my
  husband does not hold with such doings, and told his friend so pretty
  plainly. 'After all, they're men,' he said, 'and you must not treat them as
  you would not treat a beast.' 'What! 'said the other,&mdash;and I will allow
  that this did shake me a bit,&mdash;'don't you know that if these people had
  their way, there would be no more offerings in the temples, aye, and no more
  temples, either, for the matter of that, and where would you and I be then?'
  But my good man stuck to his point for all that. 'I reckon that the gods can
  take care of themselves,' he said; 'and that anyhow, they won't thank us for
  helping them in this kind of way. It is not our Roman fashion to make show of
  men in this way. No, no! if a man has to be punished, there is the regular
  way of doing it; the cross for a slave, and the axe for the free man, with
  the scourge first, if he has done anything specially bad; but as for dressing
  men up like beasts, or turning them into torches, I don't hold with it. Our
  fathers did not do it, and what was enough for them should be enough for us.'
  That was what my good man said. I have never heard him make such a long
  speech ever since we were married, for he is not a man of many words. What do
  you think, my lady?"</p>

  <p>The good woman had been quite carried away with her subject, for genuine
  as was her disgust at the Emperor's cruelties, she had a certain pleasure,
  not uncommon in her class, in the telling of horrors, and she had not noticed
  how her narrative had affected one of her hearers. Pomponia had quietly
  fainted.</p>

  <p>"Ah! poor lady," cried Statia. "It has been too much for her. I am sure
  that she must feel for the poor things."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16"></a>XVI. &mdash; WHAT THE SOLDIERS THOUGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE temple servant was not the only one among the spectators
  who had crowded the gardens of Nero, that had viewed the sight there
  presented to his gaze with disgust and horror. The Prætorians were
  particularly free and outspoken in the expressions of their feelings. Already
  they had begun to look upon themselves as the prop of the Imperial throne. It
  was to their camp that Nero had been carried almost before the breath had
  left the body of his predecessor Claudius; it was to them that the ambitious
  Agrippina had looked to give effect to the intrigue by which her son was
  preferred to the rightful heir; it was by their voices that Nero had been
  proclaimed Emperor, the vote of the Senate only following and confirming
  their previous determination.</p>

  <p>On the morning after the exhibition described in my last chapter a wine
  shop, which stood just outside the Prætorian camp, and was a favourite resort
  of the men, was crowded with soldiers taking their morning meal.</p>

  <p>"Well, Sisenna," cried a veteran, putting down his empty cup, after a
  hearty draught of his customary morning beverage of hot wine and water,
  sweetened with honey and flavoured with saxifrage, "what think you of last
  night's entertainment?"</p>

  <p>The soldier appealed to was a young man who had just been drafted into the
  Prætorian force as a reward for some good service done on the Asiatic
  frontier. He did not answer at once, but looked round the room with the air
  of one who doubts whether he may safely express his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Ha! ha!" laughed the veteran, "you are cautious, I see. That's the way
  among the legions, I am told, and quite right, too; but it's all liberty
  here. Speak out, man; we are all friends here, and there is no one to call us
  to account for what we say. Cæsar knows too well what our voices are worth to
  him to hinder our using them."</p>

  <p>"Well, Rufus," said Sisenna after a pause, "I will say frankly that it did
  not please me. It was not Roman, it was barbarian, though I must say that I
  never heard even of barbarians doing things quite so horrible."</p>

  <p>"Who are these Christians?" asked a third speaker. "What have they
  done?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't you read the Emperor's edict?" said a fourth soldier. "They set
  the city on fire, because they hate their fellow-creatures, and wish to do
  them as much damage as they can."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Sisenna, "that, anyhow, is not my experience of them. They
  may hate their fellow-creatures in general, but they are certainly very kind
  to some of them in particular. Let me tell you what I know about them of my
  own knowledge. I was very bad with fever when I was campaigning on the
  Euphrates, and had to be invalided to Antioch. There I was treated by an old
  Jew physician, who was one of them&mdash;there are a good many of these
  Christians, you must understand, in the city, and many of them are Jews.
  Well, I was a long time getting well; these marsh fevers are obstinate
  things; come back again and again when one thinks that one is quit of them.
  So I got to know the old man very well, and we had a great deal of talk
  together. He used to tell me about his Master, as he called him; Christus was
  the name he gave him,&mdash;that's how these people came to be called
  Christians. Another of his names was Jesus; the old man told me what that
  meant, but I couldn't understand it altogether. But, anyhow, this Master
  seemed to have been a very good man."</p>

  <p>"A good man!" interrupted one of his listeners. "Why, I have always heard
  that he was a turbulent Jew whom Claudius banished with a number of his
  countrymen from Rome.</p>

  <p>"No, no," Sisenna went on, "you are mistaken; at least, if my friend the
  physician told me true; Christus was never in Rome, and he was crucified, if
  I remember right, eight years before Claudius came to the throne."</p>

  <p>"Crucified, was he?" said one of the previous speakers. "Then he must have
  been a slave. Fancy a number of people calling themselves by the name of a
  slave!"</p>

  <p>"No," answered Sisenna; "as far as I could understand, he was not a slave;
  but of course, he was not a citizen. He was a workman of some kind, a
  carpenter, I think the physician told me; but whatever he was, he was a
  wonderful man. He seems to have gone about healing sick people, and making
  blind men see, and lame men walk; aye, and dead men live again."</p>

  <p>There was a general outcry at this. "No! no!" said one of the audience,
  expressing the common feeling; "that is too much to believe; the other things
  might be; but making the dead alive! you are laughing at us."</p>

  <p>"I can only tell you," said Sisenna, "what the old man told me; he said
  that he had seen these things with his own eyes. One of the dead men was a
  friend of his own, aye, and had been his patient, too, in his last illness.
  'I saw him die!' he said. I remember his very words, for I was as little
  disposed to believe the story as you are. 'I saw him die, for I had been with
  him all the time; I had done my very best to save him; and I saw him buried,
  too; then comes this Christus&mdash;he had been away, you must understand,
  when the man died&mdash;and makes them roll away the stone from the door of
  the tomb, and cries to the dead man, "Come forth!" I saw the dead man come
  out, just as he had been buried, with the grave clothes about him, and his
  chin tied up with a napkin, just as I had tied it with my own hands, when I
  knew beyond all doubt that he was dead.' These were the old physician's very
  words."</p>

  <p>"He must have been mad," said one of the audience.</p>

  <p>"Possibly," returned Sisenna; "but he wasn't in the least mad in other
  matters. He talked as sensibly as a man could, and a better physician I never
  hope to see."</p>

  <p>"But tell me," said a soldier who had been listening attentively to
  Sisenna's word, "how did this strange man come to such a bad end? If he could
  do such wonderful things, couldn't he have prevented it somehow? And couldn't
  he have made himself alive again, if he made other people?"</p>

  <p>A murmur of approval followed the speaker's words, as if he had succeeded
  in expressing the general feeling.</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Sisenna, "that is just what I asked, and the old man did
  try to explain it to me, but I could not rightly understand what he said.
  Only I made out that he needn't have died if he had not been willing."</p>

  <p>"No," cried the soldier; "that can't be true. A man choosing to die in
  such a way! It is past all belief."</p>

  <p>"Well, so I thought," said Sisenna; "but as for what you said about his
  making himself alive again, that is just what the old man told me he
  did."</p>

  <p>"Did he ever see him alive again?" some one asked.</p>

  <p>"No, he did not. I particularly asked him, and he said he was not one of
  those who did. But he believed it. He knew scores of people, he said, who had
  seen him."</p>

  <p>"This is all very strange," said the veteran who had begun the
  conversation, "and for my part, I can't make head or tail of it. But tell us,
  what sort of people are these Christians? do they do the horrible things that
  people charge them with?"</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it," replied Sisenna. "I know nothing but what is good of
  them; and I never found any one who did know, though there are plenty who are
  ready to say it. My old physician spent all his time in visiting sick people,
  and I am sure not one in ten paid him anything. He wouldn't have taken
  anything from me, but that I told him I could afford it. They had a house, he
  told me, where they took in sick folks to care for them; not people that
  could pay, you must understand, but poor workmen and slaves and lepers, all
  the poor wretches that no one else took any heed of."</p>

  <p>At this point in the conversation a newcomer entered the room. He was
  greeted with a cry of welcome. "Ha! Pansa," said one of the company, "you are
  just the man whom we want to see. Do you know anything about these folk that
  men call Christians?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I ought to," replied the man. "Don't you know that the prisoner
  whom Celer and I had charge of up to the spring of this year was one of their
  chief men? He was a Jew, but a citizen. Paulus was his name. He got into
  trouble with his countrymen at Jerusalem, and was brought before the
  Governor; but thinking that he should not get a fair trial there he appealed
  to Cæsar; so the Governor sent him over here. For some reason or other it was
  a long time before his trial came on, and meanwhile he was allowed to live in
  a house of his own here in Rome. Well, as I said, Celer and I had charge of
  him all that time. I don't know whether there is any one here who has had a
  charge of a prisoner. If there is, he won't need to be told that you get in
  that way to know as much about a man as there is to be known. You can never
  get away from him, nor he from you; chained for twelve hours to me, and then
  twelve to Celer, that is how Paulus lived for two years. And if Celer were
  here&mdash;he got his discharge, you know, about three months ago&mdash;he
  would say what I say, that one couldn't have believed that there was such a
  good man in the world as our prisoner was. And I do maintain that if the
  other Christians are anything like him, they are a very admirable set of
  people. In the first place, his patience was quite inexhaustible. I needn't
  say that it is a trying thing to a man's temper to be chained to another man.
  If it was to his own brother, he would not much like it. Of course, it is
  part of our business, and it all comes in the day's work. But we don't like
  it. And I am ashamed to say that till I got to know what sort of man this
  Paulus was, I was often rough with him, and Celer was worse; you know Celer
  had a rough temper sometimes. But we neither of us ever heard so much as an
  angry word from him. But he had other things to try him besides us, and we,
  anyhow at first, were bad enough. He had but poor health; his eyes, I
  remember in particular, were sometimes very painful. Sometimes, too, he was
  very short of money. You see he had to live on what his friends sent him, and
  now and then their contributions fell short or were delayed on the way.
  Anyhow, he had sometimes scarcely enough for food and firing. But he never
  said a word of complaint. And whenever he had anything he was always ready to
  give it away. Prisoners, for the most part, I fancy, think very little of any
  one but themselves, but he was thinking day and night of people all over the
  world, I may say. There were letters always coming and going. He could not
  write himself&mdash;his eyes were too bad&mdash;though he would add commonly
  just a few big, sprawling letters with his own hand at the end of a letter. I
  don't pretend to understand what they were all about. They were in Greek in
  the first place, and I know very little Greek; and, indeed, however much I
  might have known, I should hardly have been much the wiser. But I could see
  this, that they gave him a vast amount of trouble and care. He was thinking
  about what was in them day and night. I could hear him talking to himself,
  and he would pray. I have seen him for an hour together, aye, a couple of
  hours, on his knees praying."</p>

  <p>"Why, Pansa," cried one of the soldiers, "I do believe that you are more
  than half a Christian yourself."</p>

  <p>"I might be something much worse, my man," said the soldier.</p>

  <p>"Well, it is lucky for you that you are not one just now," retorted the
  other, "or we should have had you blazing away in a pitch tunic last
  night."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Pansa, "you may say what you like, but there is something in
  this business, you may be sure. You should have seen Paulus when the Emperor
  heard his cause. The boldest man in Rome would not have liked to stand as he
  did before the Emperor alone, with not a friend to back him up; Nero with a
  frown on his face as black as thunder, and Poppæa at Nero's side, whispering,
  as any one might have known, all kinds of mischief against him. You know she
  hates these Christians just as much as she loves the Jews. Well, I have been
  on guard pretty often at the hearing of a prisoner, but I never saw a man
  less disturbed."</p>

  <p>"Well, what became of him?" inquired one of Pansa's audience.</p>

  <p>"He was acquitted. At first, I could see plainly enough, Nero was dead
  against him. He would not let him speak a couple of sentences without
  interruption, and every now and then would burst out laughing. But he came
  round little by little. Even Poppæa was silenced. At last the Emperor said,
  'Paulus, whether you are mad or not, only the gods know; if you are, your
  madness is better than most men's sound judgment. You seem to me not to have
  offended either against the majesty of the Roman people, or against the
  welfare of the human race. My sentence is that you are acquitted.' Then the
  smith, who was waiting outside, was sent for to strike off the prisoner's
  chain. While he was doing this the Emperor said, 'How long have you been
  bound with that chain?' Paulus answered, 'For five years, wanting a month;
  that is to say, for two years and four months at Cæsarea, and for two years
  and two months here in Rome, and the journeying hither was five months,
  seeing that I suffered shipwreck on the way.' Nero said, 'You have endured a
  wrong.' Then turning to Tigellinus, he said, 'See that he be paid two hundred
  gold pieces.' That evening Paulus sent for me to his house&mdash;the place
  where we had been in charge of him. When I got there, he said to me, 'Pansa,
  I fear that I have been a great trouble to you and your comrades these two
  years past. Pardon me, if I have offended you in aught. I have not been
  ashamed of my chain, but I know that it tries a man's patience sorely, and I
  may have erred in hastiness of speech.' I declared, as indeed I had every
  reason to do, that no one could have borne himself more admirably. He went
  on, 'I have given you no gifts in these years past, such as it is customary,
  I am told, for prisoners to give to them that keep them; I judged it not
  right to do aught that might savour of corruption, and indeed, I but seldom
  had the means out of which I might give. But now I am no longer bound with
  this constraint; will it therefore please you to take these twenty-five
  pieces out of Cæsar's liberality?' Twenty-five gold pieces, gentlemen, do not
  often come in a poor soldier's way; still I was loth to take them. 'Surely,
  sir,' I said, 'you need them for yourself.' 'Nay,' said he, 'I am otherwise
  provided for.' And I happen to know that he did not keep a single piece for
  himself. He gave to Celer the same sum that he gave to me; the rest he
  distributed among the poor. After this he said to me, 'Pansa, it may and will
  be that you and I shall not meet again. Now I have never spoken to you at any
  time during these two years past of that which was nearest to my heart. I
  thought&mdash;my God knows whether wrongly or rightly&mdash;that I should
  not, because you would be constrained to listen, whether you would or not; my
  Master would have free servants only. But now it is permitted to me to
  speak.' After this he said many things which I cannot now repeat."</p>

  <p>"But he did not persuade you?" said one of the listeners.</p>

  <p>"Nay; he seemed to ask too much. On my faith, it seemed to me that to be a
  Christian was to be little better than being dead. Yet I have often wished it
  otherwise; and, if I see him again&mdash;but perhaps it is better to be
  silent."</p>

  <p>"So you don't think there is any harm in these Christians?" said the
  soldier who had first questioned him.</p>

  <p>"None at all, as I am a Roman," said Pansa.</p>

  <p>"And you don't believe they set the city on fire?"</p>

  <p>"Impossible! The Emperor has been deceived, and it is not difficult to see
  who deceived him."</p>

  <p>After this there was a silence. Though the soldiers might boast of their
  freedom of speech, every one knew that there were limits to what might safely
  be said, and that now they were very near to dangerous ground.</p>

  <p>Before long the silence was broken by the entrance of a newcomer. The man,
  who was evidently in a state of great excitement, looked hurriedly round the
  room, and caught sight of Sisenna.</p>

  <p>"Sisenna," he cried, "you know Fannius, the gladiator?"</p>

  <p>"I know him well," replied Sisenna. "I served with him in Armenia, and an
  excellent soldier he was. Well, what of him?"</p>

  <p>"He is near his end, and has sent for you."</p>

  <p>"Near his end!" cried Pansa in dismay. "Why, he had recovered from his
  wounds when I saw him a few days ago; and he told me that he was quite well.
  What ails him?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you as we go," said the messenger; "but make haste, for there
  is no time to lose."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17"></a>XVII. &mdash; IN THE PRISON</h2>

  <p class="first">THE story which Pansa heard on his way was briefly this.
  Part of it we know already. An old comrade and antagonist had informed
  against him. The man had been vanquished by Fannius in the arena, and, what
  was a more deadly offence, had been detected by him in a fraudulent attempt
  to bring about a result that would have greatly profited some disreputable
  patrons. The arrest of Fannius had followed. But the malignant spite of his
  enemy had not been satisfied. He had induced the officer in charge of the
  business to thrust this particular prisoner into the most noisome dungeon in
  Rome.</p>

  <p>Fannius had a great reputation for courage and skill in arms, and it was
  not difficult to make the officer believe, by dwelling on his lawless and
  violent temper, that he was a highly dangerous person. Accordingly, all other
  places of confinement being full, and even more than full, Fannius was thrust
  into the Tullianum, an underground cell, damp and fetid to a degree that made
  it almost intolerable. In fact, its original use had been as a place of
  execution rather than of confinement. In this King Jugurtha, after being led
  in triumph by his conqueror, had been left to starve. Here the profligate
  nobles who had conspired with Catiline against the Senate and people of Rome
  had been strangled by the hands of the public executioner. In fact, whether
  the executioner was there or no, imprisonment in this frightful dungeon, at
  least if continued for more than a few hours, was a sentence of death. So
  Fannius had found it. Though he had apparently recovered from the wounds
  received in his conflict with his savage antagonist, loss of blood and long
  confinement to his bed had really weakened him. On the third day of his
  imprisonment a malarial fever, due to the loathsome condition of the place,
  declared itself, and before forty-eight hours had passed his condition was
  desperate.</p>

  <p>Happily he was not suffered to die in this miserable dungeon. His jailer
  was an old soldier, who would probably have viewed with indifference the
  sufferings of a civilian prisoner, but who had a soft spot in his heart for
  any one who had served under the eagles. The man sent for a physician, and
  the physician peremptorily ordered removal. "He can hardly live," he told the
  jailer, when he had examined his patient; "but a dry chamber and wholesome
  air might give him a chance." The jailer had him forthwith taken to his own
  house. This was technically considered to be part of the prison, so that he
  might plead that he was only transferring his charge from one cell to
  another, and one practically as safe, considering that the sick man could not
  so much as put a foot to the ground, and indeed was more than half
  unconscious.</p>

  <p>The change of air and the careful nursing of the jailer's wife brought
  about a temporary amendment. Fannius recovered sufficient strength to be able
  to speak. Summoning his host, as he may be called, to his bedside, he
  whispered to him the names of two persons whom he particularly desired to
  see. One of them was Sisenna, an old comrade in arms, whom he was anxious to
  make executor of his will; the other was Epicharis.</p>

  <p>Sisenna was at hand, and, as we have seen, was fetched without delay.</p>

  <p>"You are a true friend," said Fannius to him, as he entered the room; "you
  are not afraid of coming to see a prisoner; a prisoner, too, charged with the
  most odious of crimes."</p>

  <p>"Afraid! No," said the soldier energetically. "And as for crime, whatever
  they may say, I know that you are altogether incapable of it. But tell me,
  how can I serve you?" "I wish you," replied Fannius, "to undertake the charge
  of distributing what little property I shall leave behind me. Subrius the
  Tribune has the charge of it. It is but a trifle, some two hundred thousand
  sesterces in all; but I should like some people to know that I have not
  forgotten them. I shall make my will by word of mouth, for there is no time
  now for writing. All will be left to you without the mention of any trust;
  but what I want you to do with the money is this. Half of the money is to go
  to the freedwoman Epicharis, lately in the service of the Empress Octavia.
  She is living with her aunt, Galla by name, at the Farm of the Two Fountains
  near Gabii. Of the other half I wish you to keep twenty thousand sesterces
  for yourself; as to the remainder, I have to give you a charge which may
  prove to be somewhat troublesome. Inquire whether I have any kinsfolk on the
  mother's side&mdash;such as I have on the father's side, are, I know, fairly
  well-off&mdash;who are both deserving and in need. Divide the money among
  such as you may find to be so, exactly as you think fit. If there are none,
  then distribute it among the poor at your discretion."</p>

  <p>"Nay, my friend," said the soldier; "but it is a formidable thing to be
  trusted in this way. How do you know that I am fit for it?"</p>

  <p>"How do I know?" replied Fannius with a smile. "Why, just in the same way
  that you knew I could not commit a crime. Do not refuse. You are a soldier,
  and, therefore, they are less likely to dispute the will, which, as made by a
  prisoner, is of doubtful force."</p>

  <p>"Let it be, then, as you will," said Sisenna.</p>

  <p>"That is well," said the sick man. "We shall need seven witnesses. There
  is the jailer and his wife and son; let them send for four others, for you,
  of course, cannot serve."</p>

  <p>The witnesses were easily found. The seven were made up of the three
  inmates of the house, three soldiers belonging to Sisenna's own company, and
  the temple servant, in whose house Pomponia had taken refuge. It so happened
  that this man was an old friend of the jailer.</p>

  <p>The form of making the verbal or nuncupatory will, as it was called, was
  of the simplest and briefest kind. The testator simply said:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I, Caius Fannius, hereby nominate Marcus Sisenna, Centurion in the fourth
  Prætorian Cohort, as heir to my undivided property."</p>

  <p>Immediately afterwards the will was reduced to writing and signed by the
  witnesses.</p>

  <p>The whole of this business was finished about the seventh hour, or one
  o'clock in the afternoon. Just about sunset Epicharis arrived.</p>

  <p>The physician had just paid his patient his evening visit, and was
  describing his condition to the jailer when Epicharis reached the house. She
  caught the sound of his voice through the door which happened to be ajar, and
  guessing from the first words that she heard who he was, and what was his
  errand in that house, stood in almost breathless suspense to listen. A rapid
  intuition told her that not to discover herself would be her best chance of
  knowing the whole truth. If he knew her relation to the sick man the
  physician would probably, after the fashion of his class, deceive her with
  some kindly meant misrepresentation of the truth.</p>

  <p>"It is as I feared," said the old man. "The improvement of yesterday was a
  last flicker. They might as well strangle a man as throw him into that pit.
  Does he wish to see any one?"</p>

  <p>The jailer told him that he made his will that morning, and that the woman
  to whom he was betrothed was coming. Would the excitement of seeing her harm
  him?</p>

  <p>"Harm him!" cried the physician. "Nothing can harm him now. Let him have
  his will in everything. He can scarce live beyond sunrise to-morrow. I will
  see him again, though I can do no good. Now I have others to visit."</p>

  <p>As he spoke the physician opened the door, and found himself face to face
  with the girl outside. What she had heard had equalled, even surpassed, her
  worst fears. That something was wrong, she had not doubted; else why should
  she have been sent for. Very likely there had been a relapse; he had been
  doing too much in Rome, and she would take him away again to country quiet
  and pure air, and nurse him back to health. And the girl, in the newly waked
  tenderness of her heart, remembered what a happy time the first nursing had
  been, the danger once over, and she took herself to task for a selfish wish
  that she might have the same delight again. And now to hear that the man she
  loved was within a few hours of his death. She stood, petrified with dismay,
  unable to speak or move.</p>

  <p>The old physician at once guessed who she was. Assuming his set,
  professional smile, he said in as cheerful a tone as he could command, for,
  used as he was to suffering, his patient's case had touched him, "Ah, my dear
  girl, you have come, I suppose, to set our friend all right. You will find
  him a little low, and must be careful with him."</p>

  <p>"Ah, sir," cried the girl, recovering her speech, "do not seek to deceive
  me. I heard all that you said, as I stood here."</p>

  <p>The old man's manner changed at once to a grave kindliness. "You know it,
  then," he said. "You are a brave girl, I see; control yourself; you will have
  time for tears hereafter; now make his last hour as happy as you can. The
  gods comfort you!"</p>

  <p>He pressed her hand with a friendly grasp, and hurried away, but it was
  long before he forgot the look of hopeless sorrow that was written on that
  beautiful face.</p>

  <p>"I am Epicharis, whom you sent for," she said to the jailer's wife as she
  entered the room. "Stay," she went on, lifting up her hand as she spoke, "I
  know the whole truth. And now let me sit here a while and recover myself
  somewhat before I see him."</p>

  <p>She sat down, and resolutely set herself to master the passion of grief
  that was struggling within for expression. A flood of tears would have been
  an inexpressible relief; but did she once give way to them, when could she
  recover her calm? Time was precious, and she must not risk losing it. By
  degrees she controlled herself, fighting down with success the dry, tearless
  sobs that for a time would rise in her breast. She consented, though loathing
  it in her heart, to drink the cup of wine which her hostess pressed upon her,
  and it certainly helped her in her struggle. In about half an hour's time she
  was calm enough to enter the sick man's chamber.</p>

  <p>Fannius had fallen into a light sleep, but awoke as she came in. For a
  time, as will often happen in cases of weakness, he failed to collect his
  thoughts. He had been dreaming of past times, days in which Epicharis had
  been cold and disdainful, and the girl's real presence seemed only to carry
  on the visionary scene which sleep had conjured up before his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Why does she come to torment me?" he said. "I had best forget her, if she
  cannot love me."</p>

  <p>The girl's eyes filled with tears. It is hard to say which pained her
  more, the thought of the happiness which she might have had, had she been
  less set on her own purposes, or that of which she had had a brief glimpse,
  but could now see no more.</p>

  <p>She threw herself on her knees by the bedside, and kissed the pale hand
  which rested on the coverlet.</p>

  <p>The touch of her warm lips recalled the dying man to himself. His eyes
  lightened with a smile of inexpressible tenderness.</p>

  <p>"You are come, darling," he said. "I knew that you would. You will stay
  with me now," he whispered after a pause. "It will not be for long."</p>

  <p>After that he seemed content to be silent. Indeed, he was almost too weak
  to speak. But, to judge from the happy smile upon his face, it was bliss to
  feel her hand in his, and to keep his eyes fixed upon her face.</p>

  <p>About an hour short of midnight he fell asleep. Epicharis sat on in the
  same posture, watching him as he slept with an intense earnestness. A little
  after dawn he woke.</p>

  <p>"Give me," he said, "a cordial. I have something to say, and need a little
  strength."</p>

  <p>The physician had left a cordial, some old Falernian wine with bettany
  root dissolved in it, in case the occasion for it should arise.</p>

  <p>Epicharis raised the sick man's head from the pillow, and put the cup to
  his lips. He took a few sips and then spoke: "Tell Subrius the Prætorian that
  he is embarked on an ill business. It will not prosper. And you, too, beware
  of it. Put away these thoughts from you. It has been borne in upon me that
  these things will be your ruin. I have had a dreadful dream since I slept. I
  saw Nero sitting on his throne, and the ground round him was covered with
  dead bodies, as thickly as if there had been a battle. But I could not see
  their faces."</p>

  <p>"But you told me yourself," said Epicharis, "of this undertaking, and
  seemed glad that it was set on foot."</p>

  <p>"Ah! but things are changed since then with me. I did not know what I know
  now."</p>

  <p>The fact was, that it was only a few days before his arrest that Fannius
  had discussed the subject with one of the Christian teachers. Probably there
  have always been two ways of thinking about the lawfulness of resistance to
  power, unrighteous in itself or unrighteously exercised. But among the early
  Christians there was certainly a greater weight of authority on the side of
  submission. "The powers that be are ordained of God" was the teaching of the
  great Apostle who had formed the views of the Church in Rome; and this view
  had been strongly enforced on Fannius by the teacher whom he consulted, one
  of those who had learnt all that they knew at the feet of St. Paul.</p>

  <p>The mind of the soldier had been much agitated by conflicting emotions.
  The old loyalty to the Emperor, which was part of a soldier's training, was
  now reinforced by a religious sanction. On the other hand, he was deeply
  committed to comrades with whose desire to free Rome from the shame of its
  present degradation he strongly sympathized. And then there was Epicharis.
  She lived, he knew, to avenge a cruel wrong to one whom she loved. This aim
  was the thing nearest to her heart, nearer, he was aware, than her love for
  him. Could he endure to disappoint her?</p>

  <p>Then came the arrest and imprisonment of the Christians. The tyrant who
  had given the order now seemed doubly hateful. Still it did not change the
  soldier's newly acquired views of duty. In one way it emphasized them. The
  more difficult submission appeared, the greater the obligation to it. "Not
  only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward," were words that rung
  in his ears. And in the near presence of his death this call of duty, as he
  conceived it, became louder and more imperative. To see Epicharis, and to
  implore her to abandon her scheme, became a pressing necessity.</p>

  <p>"I implore you," he said, "as you love me, to give up your schemes. Leave
  the wrong-doer to be punished by God. His vengeance is stronger and surer
  than ours."</p>

  <p>It was a critical moment. The girl indeed did not understand the reason
  which moved Fannius to speak in this way. She fancied that he was more
  concerned for her safety than for anything else. Still his entreaty weighed
  greatly with her. He was a dying man, and the last requests of the dying are
  hard to refuse; and she felt, too, that she owed him some redress. The words
  "I promise" were almost on her lips. Had she spoken them the fate of many
  persons with whom our story is concerned might have been different. But at
  the very moment she was about to speak there came a sudden interruption.</p>

  <p>An official sent to inspect the prison had discovered the change which the
  keeper of the Tullianum had taken upon himself to make in the custody of
  Fannius. As he had been specially instructed to allow no relaxation in the
  severity of imprisonment, he at once directed that the man should be carried
  back to the dungeon from which he had been transferred. The jailer in vain
  represented that the prisoner was dying. "That makes no difference," was the
  answer. "I must obey my orders," and he pushed his way, followed by two
  attendants, into the chamber of death.</p>

  <p>"There he is," he cried to the men; "carry him back, dead or alive."</p>

  <p>At the sound of his voice, Epicharis rose from where she had been kneeling
  by the bedside, and confronted the two men.</p>

  <p>"You shall not touch him," she cried.</p>

  <p>The attendants fell back astonished, so majestic was she in the white heat
  of her wrath.</p>

  <p>"Thrust her aside," cried their more hardened master, from where he stood
  in the background.</p>

  <p>The men hesitated; she might have a weapon in her dress, and looked quite
  capable of dealing a mortal blow.</p>

  <p>The inspector, infuriated at this delay, now himself made a forward
  movement.</p>

  <p>At this moment a voice from behind changed the woman's mood.</p>

  <p>"Epicharis!" said the dying man feebly.</p>

  <p>She turned to him with a gesture of tenderness.</p>

  <p>"Hinder them not," he whispered. "I can die as easily there as here. Kiss
  me, dearest. The Lord Christ bless and keep you, and bring us to meet
  again."</p>

  <p>She stooped to kiss him.</p>

  <p>Even the brutal official could not interrupt this parting. When it was
  over, his victim was out of the reach of his cruelty. Fannius was dead.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; SURRENDER</h2>

  <p class="first">POPPAEA and her advisers were not inclined, it may easily be
  supposed, to rest satisfied with their double defeat in the matter of
  Pomponia. That she had escaped from the illegal violence of the first attack
  was vexatious enough, but it was a thing that had to be endured. It was a
  different thing when she was found to have eluded a legal order for her
  arrest. The question was, how was the hiding-place of the fugitives to be
  discovered? Nothing was learnt by the strictest inquiries at Subrius' country
  house. The inmates, some of whom Tigellinus did not scruple to torture,
  evidently knew nothing about the matter. The two ladies had disappeared a few
  hours before the arrival of the arresting party; beyond that, nothing could
  be learnt. Supposed confessions, which were wrung out of one of the slaves,
  were found not to lead to any discoveries. It was soon seen that they were
  fictions, produced to obtain an immediate release from pain, as confessions
  obtained by pressure of torture frequently were. A more hopeful plan was to
  search through the multitude of arrested persons for some one who might
  really be willing and able to give such information as would lead to a
  discovery. Slaves who had been in Pomponia's household in Rome were found,
  but they could easily prove that they knew nothing more of her movements
  beyond her departure from the city. It was when she left Subrius' house that
  she seemed to have vanished into space. Poppæa, however, was not to be
  baffled. One person, she learnt, had accompanied Pomponia on her journey;
  this was the old steward. It was probable that he was in possession of the
  secret of her hiding-place. If he was arrested, it might be extorted from
  him. The detectives were immediately put upon his track, and it was not long
  before their search was successful. Sad to say, it was a fellow-believer, or,
  at least, one who professed himself to be such, that betrayed him. Even in
  days when nothing, it would seem, that could attract, was to be gained by the
  profession of Christian belief, there were some who made that profession
  without adequate conviction. The mere reckless desire of change, or a passing
  emotion that was mistaken for genuine faith, led them into a false position.
  Or they were of that class, who, as the Master had foreseen, would receive
  the word gladly, and in times of persecution fall away; and, it must be
  confessed, the trial was terrible. Under such pressure, strong natures might
  well have failed; much more this poor young slave, feeble in frame, and of a
  selfish, pleasure-loving temper, who gave the fatal information about
  Phlegon. The bribe of freedom, safety, and a sum of fifty thousand sesterces,
  that seemed to assure him of a future livelihood, were too much for his
  constancy and good faith. The information that he gave enabled the officers,
  before three days were over, to arrest the old man.</p>

  <p>Even then Poppæa and her friends did not seem much nearer to the
  attainment of their object. Questioned as to whether he was acquainted with
  Pomponia's hiding- place, he did not affect to deny it. His sturdy principle
  forbade him to speak anything but the truth, however much it might be to his
  own injury. But at this acknowledgment he stopped. He could not, indeed,
  bring his lips to say the thing that was not; but beyond this he did not feel
  his obligation to go. Any information that might help the persecutors to
  secure their prey, he resolutely refused to give. Bribes were tried at first;
  they were contemptuously rejected. Threats were freely used, but seemed to
  make no impression. Torture was then employed. The old Roman rule that it was
  never to be applied to free persons had long since fallen into neglect. For
  some years past persons of much higher rank than the old steward had been
  exposed to it. When even Senators and knights had been stretched on the rack,
  and tortured with the heated plates of metal, it was not likely that an
  insignificant freedman would escape.</p>

  <p>But even torture seemed little likely to be successful. Indeed, the limits
  of its possible application were very soon reached. Phlegon was old and
  feeble; a few minutes sufficed to throw him into a long faint from which it
  was no easy matter to recall him. The physician slave, who was in attendance,
  to guard against this very risk, warned the executioner that another
  application would very probably be fatal.</p>

  <p>Yet, curiously enough, the very patience and courage of the sufferer
  helped to reveal the secret which he would gladly have given his life to
  keep. Phlegon had been confined in the Tullianum, though not in one of its
  lower dungeons; and the jailer, as being responsible for his prisoners, had
  been present when the torture was applied. Hardened as he was by more than
  twenty years of office, the events of the last few days had touched him. He
  had seen innocent men suffer before, but never men of quite the same stamp as
  Fannius and Phlegon. So full was he of the feelings thus raised, that as soon
  as he was released from his duties, he went to talk the subject over with his
  friends, the temple servant and his wife. And thus the tidings reached
  Claudia. From Pomponia herself all such things were carefully kept.</p>

  <p>Statia had not heard from the jailer the name of the sufferer; but Claudia
  recognized in her description of him Pomponia's steward. And when she further
  heard that he was being tortured in order to compel him to reveal the hiding-
  place of a noble lady who was accused of being a Christian, any doubt that
  she may have had of his identity was removed.</p>

  <p>It was with the greatest difficulty that the girl retained her self-
  control, while her hostess gossiped on, repeating, in her usual fashion, the
  description of the suffering and the fortitude of Phlegon, which the jailer
  had given her. Left at last to think over the matter, she was in sore
  perplexity. Should she keep what she had heard to herself, or should she
  communicate it to Pomponia? She could not, of course, entirely forget that
  her own life was at stake, and she grew sick and faint when she remembered
  the horrors of which she had been told. Still it was not this, it was her
  duty to Pomponia, that made her hesitate. Pomponia, beyond all doubt, would
  give herself up to save the old man's life. But would she save it? Would she
  not be only sacrificing her own? The old man was most certainly doomed. Why
  should another be uselessly involved in his fate? All this seemed reasonable
  enough. Still she could not persuade herself that it was right. What would
  Pomponia herself say? Supposing that she kept the matter from her now, would
  she ever be able to reveal it? Could she ever go to her and say, "I knew that
  your faithful servant was being tortured, and I kept it from you?" This
  thought in the end decided her. It must, she felt, be wrong so to act that
  there would be a lifelong secret between herself and her nearest friend.</p>

  <p>Her resolution once arrived at, she lost no time in carrying it out.
  "Mother," she said to Pomponia, "the persecutors have laid hands on Phlegon,
  and have tortured him to wring out the secret of our hiding-place."</p>

  <p>Pomponia's spirits had for some time been drooping and depressed. She knew
  that her fellow-believers were suffering. Why was she not among them? Why,
  when they were bravely confessing their Lord, was she in hiding? And yet she
  could not bring herself to feel that duty bade her deliver herself up, and
  still less that she ought to endanger her young companion. Her courage rose
  instantaneously to the occasion.</p>

  <p>"Brave old man!" she cried. "And of course he has been silent. Nothing, I
  am sure, could wring from his lips a word that was false or base. But he must
  not suffer. They shall not have to ask him again. They shall hear what they
  want from me. But, my child, what shall we do with you? "</p>

  <p>"Can you ask, mother? " cried the girl. "Whithersoever you go, I go
  also."</p>

  <p>"Nay, my child," said Pomponia; "there is no need for that."</p>

  <p>The girl stood up with flashing eyes, a true daughter of kings. "I hope
  you do not hold me unworthy of your company. Mother," she added in a softer
  tone, while she threw her arms round the elder woman's neck, "you will not
  bid me leave you?"</p>

  <p>"Let us pray," said Pomponia.</p>

  <p>The two women knelt together, hand clasped in hand. Such supplications,
  whether expressed in words, or only conceived in the heart, are too sacred to
  be written down. They rose comforted and strengthened, the path of duty plain
  before them. Whatever burden it might be the will of their Master to put upon
  them, they would bear it together.</p>

  <p>"Bid our hostess send for a litter," said Pomponia. "We will go without
  delay to the palace."</p>

  <p>An hour afterwards as Nero sat in council with Poppæa and Tigellinus a
  freedman announced that the Lady Pomponia, together with Claudia, daughter of
  Cogidumnus, King of the Regni in Britain, were below, and awaited the
  Emperor's pleasure.</p>

  <p>Poppæa's eyes gleamed with a sinister joy.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, neither Nero nor his Minister were particularly
  pleased. Tigellinus' spies and agents, of whom he had a vast number in Rome,
  had reported to him that popular sympathy was now turning in favour of the
  sufferers. Had they been the worst of criminals, the ferocity of the
  punishments inflicted on them would have roused a feeling of pity; and it was
  doubtful whether they were criminals at all. Of course the free-spoken
  comments of the Prætorians at what had happened were not unknown to him. If
  this had been the case in the case of obscure and insignificant persons, what
  would happen when the victim was a high-born and distinguished lady.</p>

  <p>"How is it your pleasure to deal with them, Sire?" asked Tigellinus after
  a short pause.</p>

  <p>"Let them be sent to the Tullianum," cried Poppæa, carried by her spite
  out of her usual prudence.</p>

  <p>Nero turned upon them with an angry scowl.</p>

  <p>"Peace, woman," he shouted in a voice of thunder. "You know not what you
  say. These ladies are ten times better born than you."</p>

  <p>The Empress, furious as she was at the rebuff, choked down her rage, and
  murmured, "As you will, Sire."</p>

  <p>"Let them be handed over to the keeping of Lateranus till it be convenient
  to hear their case," was the Emperor's decision.</p>

  <p>"The Emperor remembers," said Tigellinus, "that Lateranus is the nephew of
  the Lady Pomponia."</p>

  <p>"I know it," answered the Emperor. "It will serve well enough. She will be
  honourably kept and safely. That is enough. See that the necessary orders be
  given. Pardon me, my dearest," he went on, turning to Poppæa. "I would not
  willingly thwart you in anything, but there are reasons, which I am sure you
  will see, if you give yourself time to think. I will not ask you," he added
  with a bitter smile, "to be lenient to these prisoners because they are
  women. That, I have found out, is scarcely a passport to a woman's favour.
  But you must remember that Pomponia is the widow of a great general, whose
  name is still remembered among the soldiers, while her companion is the
  daughter of a King. You cannot deal with such as if they were the wife and
  daughter of a freedman."</p>

  <p>"You know best, Sire," said the Empress in a voice from which she vainly
  endeavoured to banish all traces of sulkiness.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, my Poppæa," replied Nero; "we shall doubtless agree. And now to
  more serious business. This is the first draft of what I propose to recite at
  the games."</p>

  <p>Four years before Nero had instituted what was to be a Roman rival to the
  Olympian games. The second celebration was at hand, and he had been preparing
  a poem on the Deification of Romulus, which he proposed to recite in public.
  It was this that he now submitted to the criticism of his privy council.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19"></a>XIX. &mdash; EPICHARIS ACTS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE conspirators had not been indifferent spectators of the
  events recorded in the preceding chapters. Everything combined to raise their
  hopes. The Emperor seemed to be madly rushing on to his own ruin. The
  monstrous freak, which common report more and more confidently attributed to
  him, of burning his own capital, the revolting cruelty with which he had
  sought to divert suspicion from himself to a set of poor creatures, who, at
  the worst, were harmless fanatics, the unseemly buffoonery by which he
  lowered his Imperial dignity, were all helping, they thought, to overthrow
  the throne. Every day appeared to be giving to their schemes a more certain
  prospect of success. As long as this was so, it naturally seemed a mistake to
  hurry on their execution. Give the wretch time enough, so they said to each
  other, and he will destroy himself; he will not have a single friend left
  among nobles, people, or army.</p>

  <p>There were some, the Tribune Subrius among them, who chafed angrily at
  this delay. He never could rid himself of the idea that he had already missed
  a great chance, when he abandoned his plan of striking down Nero in his
  private theatre, and he strongly protested against losing more time.
  Conspiracies that are long in hatching were, he knew, infallibly betrayed
  either by treachery or by chance. "There are too many of us," he said to one
  of his military confederates; "we are too powerful; had we been only a few
  desperate fellows with nothing to lose, it would have been settled, and
  probably settled in the right way, long ago.</p>

  <p>In this impatient mood Epichris found him a few days after that on which
  Fannius had breathed his last. In the morning he had been present at a
  meeting of the conspirators, and had again urged on them the necessity of
  speedy action. Pudens, who had been formally enrolled among the associates,
  as heartily supported him. He agreed with him in theory, and he found
  additional reason in the imminent danger of Claudia, of which he had by this
  time become aware. Their arguments were in vain; the majority overbore
  them.</p>

  <p>The two friends, as they discussed the question in Subrius' quarters,
  became more and more convinced that in one way or another a crisis must be
  precipitated.</p>

  <p>"These men," said Subrius to his companion, "are thinking of something
  else besides the one thing needful, which is to get rid of the tyrant.
  Laternus, for instance, is thinking about his own life; Piso is thinking
  about his own chances of the Empire. Now a man ought to care for nothing but
  how he may drive home his blow."</p>

  <p>"Right!" cried Pudens. "Why should we not act for ourselves? Let us give
  them another seven days, and then cast lots who shall strike, you or I."</p>

  <p>"Agreed!" said Subrius, stretching out his hand.</p>

  <p>Just as he spoke, a soldier servant knocked at the door of the room, and,
  bidden to enter, announced that a young man wished to speak with the
  Tribune.</p>

  <p>"Show him in," said the Prætorian, and the visitor was ushered into the
  room.</p>

  <p>The newcomer wore the heavy hood which the Romans commonly used for
  purposes of disguise. Its depths hid the features of the face more
  effectually, as the wearer carefully took a place where the light fell from
  behind.</p>

  <p>"Do I speak to Subrius the Prætorian?" said the visitor.</p>

  <p>"That is my name," replied the soldier.</p>

  <p>"And this?" the speaker went on, indicating Pudens with a slight wave of
  the hand.</p>

  <p>"My friend, Marcus Annius Pudens, from whom I have no secrets."</p>

  <p>"Then I may speak freely?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>Throwing back the hood, the visitor revealed the features of
  Epicharis.</p>

  <p>Pudens had never seen her before, but Subrius immediately remembered the
  features of the girl whom he had seen speaking to Fannius in the school of
  Thraso.</p>

  <p>The name of the ex-gladiator, whom, indeed, he had missed for some days,
  without knowing anything of his fate, naturally rose to his lips.</p>

  <p>"And Fannius?" he said. "How does he fare?"</p>

  <p>"I have now another besides Octavia to avenge," answered the girl in a low
  voice.</p>

  <p>"What?" cried the Prætorian. "Hath any evil overtaken him?"</p>

  <p>Epicharis told him the story that we know. When she had finished she went
  on: "Fannius told me&mdash;it was when we were newly betrothed,"&mdash;the
  girl's voice broke for a moment as she uttered the word, but was firm again
  the next moment,&mdash;"that there were some who were minded not to suffer
  the wrongs which Rome has suffered to go unpunished any longer. He gave me no
  names; I asked him for none, though I think I can keep a secret. But ever
  since I first knew him he used to speak of you; and to you, accordingly, I
  have come. Let me speak plainly. If you have in your mind the purpose that I
  suppose you to have, let me help you. I have now only one thing to live for,
  to punish the monster who first killed my mistress, and then did to death my
  lover. If you have no such thoughts, if you think me a criminal for
  cherishing them, then give me up to Nero. I shall be content, for I have no
  more desire to live."</p>

  <p>The situation in which Subrius found himself was perplexing in the
  extreme. That the woman was in earnest he did not doubt for a moment. He had
  heard, we know, her story from Fannius, and had been greatly impressed by it.
  And now her look, her words, carried with them an irresistible conviction of
  her earnestness; but he hesitated. The lives and fortunes of others besides
  himself were at stake. To confide in a woman was certainly a novel
  experiment, and at first sight at least dangerous. If failure was the result,
  how overpowering the shame and the disgrace of having made it. After a
  hurried review of the circumstances he resolved to temporize. Probably he was
  wrong. Everything did go wrong in this unlucky undertaking. But almost every
  one, viewing the circumstances as he viewed them, would have said that he was
  right.</p>

  <p>"Lady," he began, "I will be as frank with you as you have been with me.
  If you have put your life in my hands, so will I put mine in yours. I do not
  deny that I and my friends have had the purposes of which you speak, yes, and
  have them still. But these things are not done in a hurry; we must watch our
  time, our opportunity; when that comes we shall not be wanting, nor shall we
  fail, if we need your help, to ask for it. Till then we must be patient and
  silent."</p>

  <p>Epicharis was bitterly disappointed at this procrastinating answer. She
  was not in a mood to wait and be patient. Action, immediate action, was an
  imperative necessity. She rose to go, wrapping the hood again round her
  face.</p>

  <p>"I am only a woman," she said, "and know less and can do less than you;
  yet I think that you are wrong. You say that these things cannot be done in a
  hurry; it seems to me that they must be so done, if they are to be done at
  all."</p>

  <p>The next moment she was gone.</p>

  <p>"By all the gods in heaven, she is right!" cried Subrius to Pudens when
  they found themselves alone. "I wish that I could have trusted her. But it
  was impossible. If any mishap were to come of it, what would not the others
  have said&mdash;'wheedled out of his senses by a woman,' and all the rest of
  it. It would be intolerable. And yet, I have a feeling that it would have
  been better."</p>

  <p>Better it would certainly have been.</p>

  <p>Epicharis, as has been said, was not content to wait. If Subrius would not
  help her, where, she asked herself, could she find some one who would? In a
  moment, for she was in that condition of exaltation and excitement when ideas
  have a rapid birth, a daring scheme presented itself to her mind. Nowhere was
  Nero more easily approached than when he was at one of his favourite seaside
  haunts. There he was accustomed to dispense with the etiquette and ceremony
  which surrounded him at Rome. His bodyguard, whom he always regarded more as
  a part of Imperial state than as a necessary protection, was often dismissed.
  He would spend many hours with not more than one or two companions, either
  wandering on the shore, or rowing in a boat, or fishing from the rocks. What
  could be easier, she thought, if only she could find an accomplice, to
  surprise him in one of those unguarded moments?</p>

  <p>Resolving to seek such an accomplice herself, the first necessity that she
  perceived was of an effectual disguise. The man's dress which she had assumed
  in order to find her way to the quarters of Subrius had served its purpose
  well enough on that occasion. But it would not now suffice, and she
  accordingly resolved to assume the character of a singing-girl. This she
  could do with great ease; she had a particularly sweet voice, and could sing
  and play with more than usual skill. A further disguise was secured by
  wearing Syrian dress and ornaments, and by adding a deeper brown to her
  complexion. Another device, which she felt might be useful in carrying out
  her scheme, was to pretend ignorance of any language but Greek, except so far
  as the use of a few words of broken Latin might go.</p>

         title="Epicharis">

    <p class="caption">Epicharis</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Thus apparelled and equipped, she made her way down to Misenum, where a
  squadron of the fleet was stationed. She began by singing outside the wine
  shops to which the sailors were accustomed to resort, and speedily achieved a
  great success. Her reputation as an accomplished performer spread among the
  higher circles, and it was not long before she was engaged to perform at a
  banquet given by one of the captains to his colleagues. Other similar
  invitations followed. As the guests spoke freely before her, presuming on her
  supposed ignorance of Latin, while she always kept her ears open, and
  listened with an eager attention which suffered nothing to escape her, she
  soon learnt much about the characters and tempers of the officers in
  command.</p>

  <p>One of these men, Proculus by name, she recognized as an old acquaintance.
  He had once been in command of the yacht which belonged to Agrippina, the
  Emperor's mother. It was one of the very few pleasures of Octavia's unhappy
  life to join her mother-in-law in occasional excursions round the Campanian
  coast. At these times Epicharis had often been in waiting, and Proculus had
  regarded her with much admiration. She gathered now from words that he let
  drop in her hearing, and from what was said by others, that he was in a
  dissatisfied frame of mind. He was accustomed to talk vaguely of great
  services which he had rendered to the Emperor, and which had received a very
  inadequate reward. This seemed to promise some sort of an opening, and she
  resolved, in default of anything better, to avail herself of it. It is true
  that she did not like or trust the man. In old times he had not been a
  favourite; his openly expressed admiration had, on the contrary, been
  extremely offensive to her. But she was almost in despair. She had not found
  in the fleet any of the explosive material, so to speak, which she had hoped
  to discover there. Nero seemed to be highly popular. He mixed freely with the
  sailors, treated them in a friendly fashion, and was liberal in his presents.
  Still, for her present purpose, one such adherent as Proculus would suffice.
  Carried out of herself by her eagerness for revenge, with her mind, in fact,
  thrown off its balance by this excitement, she resolved to make the
  trial.</p>

  <p>One day, in the course of an entertainment, Proculus had paid her some
  compliment on her musical skill and gone on to express his admiration for her
  beauty. Crushing down disgust at his advances, for the man was personally
  odious to her, Epicharis gave an answer that encouraged further conversation,
  and induced him, with no little skill, to speak of himself, his
  disappointments, and his claims. Artfully expressing a sympathetic surprise
  that he had not reached a position more commensurate with his merits, of
  which he had indeed an unbounded opinion, she led him on to use language
  which certainly had an almost treasonable sound. As a matter of fact, this
  talk was mere bluster. He would not have used it to any one who would, he
  thought, have taken it seriously. But this was exactly what Epicharis did.
  When she judged that he had to a certain extent committed himself, she
  revealed her identity. The man, though somewhat confused with the wine which
  he had been drinking, at once perceived that there was something serious in
  the affair. Epicharis he had almost forgotten, but he was perfectly well
  aware that Octavia had left devoted friends behind her. He listened with
  attention when she began to hint at the scheme which was in her mind. She
  would tell him no names, but she gave him to understand that there were
  powerful people behind her, people who would be able and willing to
  remunerate him handsomely for any service that he might render. Only, she was
  careful to impress upon him, he must lose no time; he must not let any one
  else anticipate him.</p>

  <p>For a time the man wavered. It might be worth his while, he thought, to
  make the venture. It might be possible to secure a position really worth
  having under a new order of things. He was ambitious, so far as a greedy,
  pleasure- loving temper could make him so, and for a few moments he seemed to
  see within his reach great power and wealth, and all the opportunities of
  pleasure which these two things command. And though he was a dull, brutal,
  utterly selfish creature, the enthusiasm of Epicharis, backed as it was by
  the charm of her beauty, touched his fancy if not his heart.</p>

  <p>But when the magic of her presence was removed, he began to see
  impossibilities in the way which had not occurred to him before. In fact, the
  man's past was such that if Epicharis had but known it, he would have been
  the very last person in the world in whom she would have confided. The
  services which he had rendered to Nero, and for which he conceived himself to
  have been insufficiently paid, were such as to put an absolutely impassable
  gulf between him and the revolutionists. He had been Nero's tool in the
  perpetration of the very worst of his crimes, the murder of his mother. It
  was he who had been in command of the yacht in which she nearly met with her
  death. He was actually present and assisting when the hideous deed was
  finally accomplished. Nero might not be duly grateful for such services, but
  from any one else they would meet with no other reward than the halter or the
  axe. When Nero had received his due, then those who had helped to rid him of
  his mother and his wife would not be long in meeting with theirs. Epicharis'
  schemes, therefore, had, when he came to examine them, nothing attractive
  about them. Still, as he soon began to reflect, they might be made to yield a
  profit. Why not use them to put Nero under a second obligation? Why not give
  information of them, and pose as the saviour of the Emperor's life?</p>

  <p>This last purpose was almost immediately carried out. Before the next day
  had dawned Proculus was at Antium, where Nero was then residing, and in the
  course of a few hours Tigellinus was in possession of all that he had to
  communicate. The Minister acted promptly. Epicharis, who had been eagerly
  waiting for some communication from Proculus, was arrested in her lodging by
  a Centurion, conveyed in a litter to the Emperor's villa at Antium, and
  almost immediately after confronted with her accuser.</p>

  <p>She did not lose her self-possession and presence of mind for a moment.
  Proculus told his story, not, of course, without exaggeration, and the
  addition of details which made it more picturesque and effective. She met it
  with a flat denial. He had no witnesses to produce; and for the present, at
  least, her word was as good as his.</p>

  <p>As for herself, she made no attempt at concealment. She had been a waiting
  woman of the Empress, and she had loved her mistress.</p>

  <p>Questioned as to the reason why she had disguised herself as a singing-
  girl, she smiled and shrugged her shoulders. It was partly, she explained, a
  frolic, but chiefly because she was desperately poor. "My mistress," she
  explained with the utmost simplicity of manner, "left me a legacy, which
  would have put me beyond poverty; but it has not yet been paid to me."</p>

  <p>The shaft struck home, as it had been intended to strike, though the
  intention was admirably concealed. Nero blushed and winced. He had had the
  meanness to refuse, or, rather, to postpone indefinitely, the payment of the
  few legacies which Octavia had left to her attendants.</p>

  <p>Every inquiry she met with the same imperturbable composure. She missed no
  opportunity of planting a sting in the consciences of her
  questioners&mdash;if consciences they had; but no one could be sure that it
  was done with intention. In the end, she came out of the cross-examination,
  which was protracted and severe, without having made a single damaging
  admission.</p>

  <p>When accuser and accused were removed from the presence, the Emperor
  summed up the case after this fashion. "Well, the woman has much more the
  look of telling the truth than the man. And he is, I know, a thorough
  scoundrel. However, where there is smoke there is pretty sure to be fire. See
  that she is kept in safe custody, Tigellinus, but don't let any harm come to
  her. We shall see what happens."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap20"
     name="chap20"></a>XX. &mdash; THE PLOT THICKENS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE arrest and detention of Epicharis was soon known to the
  conspirators at Rome. At the result of the examination, they could only
  guess. However, as she was being kept in honourable custody, without having
  to suffer any indignity or hardship, it was safe to conjecture that nothing
  compromising had been discovered.</p>

  <p>Still the incident was alarming, and made the necessity of immediate
  action more pressing than ever. A meeting of the conspirators, who now
  numbered more than fifty in all, itself a most dangerous circumstance, was
  held without delay. At this it was unanimously resolved, almost without
  discussion, that the attempt must be made at the very first convenient
  opportunity. The Tribune Subrius, who was generally recognized as one of the
  most daring of the associates, and who, if it had only been permitted, would
  have struck the blow long before, was invited to give his opinion as to the
  time, the place, and the manner of the deed, which, it must be understood,
  was nothing else than the assassination of Nero.</p>

  <p>Subrius had thought out his plan, and had the details ready. "In my
  judgment," he said," we have already waited too long; but of that it is now
  useless to speak, except so far as to prove that we should wait no longer. We
  are in imminent danger. A woman, who knows at least the names of two of us,
  is in prison on this very charge; and though I know her to be brave and
  steadfast beyond the habit of her sex, the peril that lies in her knowledge
  is great. Let us anticipate it. To-night Nero goes to Baiæ, and takes up his
  abode in the villa of Caius Piso. There is no place where he lives in so
  little state; and state, with the multitudes of guards and attendants that it
  implies, is the same thing as safety. I propose that the deed be done
  to-morrow, and I offer myself as the doer of it. Suffer me to choose the
  hour, and also my companion, for more than one I shall not need."</p>

  <p>A murmur of applause followed the speech. When it had subsided, all eyes
  were turned to Piso. His approval was necessary, not only as being the owner
  of the villa, but as being, so to speak, the heir presumptive to the throne.
  Piso rose immediately.</p>

  <p>"It vexes me," he said, "to differ, as my conscience compels me, from the
  counsel of a most gallant and energetic gentleman. You have thought me worthy
  of succeeding to the dignity about to be left vacant by the most merited
  punishment of him who now unworthily occupies it. But I cannot consent to
  polluting the first auspices of my rule by an atrocious crime. It is not that
  I think the slaughter of an impious and bloodstained wretch to be anything
  but a worthy deed; it is that the vilest of mankind may gain pity, and even
  pardon, by the manner of his death. Nero, indeed, deserves to die; but that
  he should perish, a guest at the table of his host, while he is enjoying in
  security the entertainment which I offer to him, would be a thing equally
  odious to both gods and men. Power acquired by such a crime could not be
  exercised with benefit either to the Roman people or myself. Both as a
  private man, to whom the sanctity of his house is as precious as it is to all
  good citizens, or as the man about to be called by your suffrage to the
  Imperial power, I refuse my consent to the execution of this plan."</p>

  <p>There was a general feeling of disappointment, and even dismay, when Piso
  sat down. It was generally felt that the reason which he had given for his
  dissent was both true and false: so far true that no one could dispute its
  validity; so far false that it did not express his whole mind. It was
  founded, not on a scruple, but a fear. Assure him of the succession, and he
  would have struck Nero as he sat at his table, with his own hand, all laws of
  hospitality notwithstanding. It was the obstacle that such a deed might be to
  this succession that he feared. He was not indispensable; to many he would
  not be the most eligible candidate for power. The scale might be thus finally
  turned against him. There might be a general agreement on some rival who
  would begin the new reign unstained by crime. Such a rival he had in his
  mind, a man of blameless morals and of race as noble as his own, with the
  added distinction of being a descendant of Augustus. Still, whatever his
  motives, his decision was final.</p>

  <p>The next speaker was a Senator, Scævinus by name.</p>

  <p>"Three days hence," he said, "the Feast of Ceres begins. The Emperor will
  certainly attend on the last day. Then will be our chance. When he comes down
  from his box, as he always does, will be the time."</p>

  <p>"That," said Subrius, "puts it off for eleven days more, and no one knows
  what may happen in that time. Still, I shall be ready."</p>

  <p>Scævinus stood up again. "The help of our friend Subrius will be welcome
  then as always; but I claim the chief part in the deed for myself; it is my
  hand that must strike the first blow."</p>

  <p>A murmur of surprise ran through the meeting. No one had ever been able to
  guess why Scævinus had associated himself with the enterprise. He was a man
  of dissolute life, who had never shown any kind of energy except in the
  pursuit of pleasure. As for his present demand, it was nothing less than
  astonishing. However, it could not well be refused; the meeting had accepted
  the scheme, and its proposer must be allowed to take the chief share in
  it.</p>

  <p>Subrius shrugged his shoulders. "What does the man mean?" he whispered to
  his next neighbour. "No one more unfit could have been found if we had
  searched Rome through from one end to the other. The man has neither strength
  nor nerve. If he ever had them, which I much doubt, for he comes of a bad
  stock, he has wasted them long ago."</p>

  <p>The Tribune's feelings were shared by others, especially the soldiers; and
  there were manifest signs of dissent.</p>

  <p>At this point Lateranus rose. "Suffer me to explain what we propose. I
  have a private request to make of the Emperor; as we are all friends here, I
  don't mind saying that it is a petition for a grant out of the privy purse in
  aid of the expenses of my Consulship. He has had notice that I am going to
  prefer it; he likes to make a parade of his liberality, and so he will not be
  surprised when I ask him this favour in public. I shall throw myself down on
  my knees before him, when he comes down from his box, and take care to do it
  in such a way as to upset him. When he is once down I shall not let him get
  up again. Then will be the time for all my friends who desire to have a hand
  in the affair to run up and do their best to rid the world of this monster.
  All that Scævinus demands is the glory of being allowed to strike the first
  blow!"</p>

  <p>This explanation put a new and more satisfactory face on the matter.
  Lateranus was a man of huge stature and of great personal strength; of his
  courage and resolution there was no question.</p>

  <p>"That sounds better," said the Prætorian to his friend. "Practically,
  Lateranus takes the first part; he is in every way fit for it, and besides,
  he has an unimpeachable reason for approaching the Emperor. Scævinus'
  privilege of striking the blow is only a concession to his trumpery vanity,
  which, I suppose, we need not grudge him. If he does not make haste about it,
  when his turn comes, I know that I for one shall not wait for him. And yet I
  can't help wishing that the silly fool had nothing to do with it. He may make
  a failure of it all yet."</p>

  <p>A few more details remained to be arranged. It was obviously inexpedient
  that all the conspirators should take part in the assassination. Some would
  have to manage the not less important business of suggesting a successor.
  Accordingly a division of forces was made. Fifteen would be quite as many as
  were wanted to make sure of the Emperor's death. These were to find places as
  near as possible to the steps which led down from the Emperor's box into the
  arena. Others were to be scattered in prominent places about the building,
  and were to shout, as soon as the deed was done, "Hail, Caius Piso, Cæsar
  Augustus Imperator!"</p>

  <p>For the rest of the conspirators a still more important function was
  reserved. The voices of the people were of little account without the consent
  and approval of the soldiers. Piso, it was arranged, was to be in waiting in
  the temple of Ceres. As soon as the deed was done, the remainder of the
  associates, including the most popular of the officers engaged in the
  conspiracy, and one or two Senators who had served in former years with
  distinction, and so were known to the soldiers, were to hurry the candidate
  for the Empire to the camp of the Prætorians. When the soldiers' voices were
  won by flatteries, promises, and bribes, all would be well. The Senate might
  be relied upon to register the decision of the men of war. Before nightfall,
  on the nineteenth of April, it was hoped that messengers would be on their
  way to the great camps on the frontiers, carrying the announcement that Caius
  Piso was now, by choice of the Senate and people of Rome, Cæsar Augustus,
  Imperator, Dictator, Tribune of the People, with perpetual authority.</p>

  <p>During the intervening days nothing of importance occurred. Nero paid his
  proposed visit to Piso's villa at Baiæ. From thence he came to Rome, arriving
  in the city on the third day of the festival. He did not show himself at this
  or any of the five following days. But this excited no apprehension. It was
  not his custom to attend except on the last day. That he would be present
  then was practically certain, for it was advertised that the Emperor would
  contend with certain named competitors in a chariot-race.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the secret of the conspiracy was kept with a fidelity that,
  considering the number of the persons engaged, was in the last degree
  astonishing. On the eve of the appointed day everything was hope and
  confidence. Unfortunately there was one element of weakness, and that one was
  to have disastrous consequences.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap21"
     name="chap21"></a>XXI. &mdash; BETRAYED</h2>

  <p class="first">SCAEVINUS had been for some time repenting, if not of his
  share in the conspiracy, certainly of the impulse which had prompted him to
  demand the most prominent place in the execution of its purpose. It was now
  impossible to draw back; if pride had not forbidden&mdash;and with all his
  weakness he was still a Roman&mdash;his associates might suspect him of
  treachery, and summarily silence him. The only thing left for him was to
  fortify his courage as best he could.</p>

  <p>His first step was to choose for the deed what he conceived to be a
  peculiarly lucky weapon. Though, like most of his contemporaries, he believed
  in little or nothing, he was curiously superstitious, a combination of
  apparent opposites which has never been uncommon, and which in the
  pleasure-loving society of Rome was peculiarly frequent. He happened to be
  the head of a family in which the care of a famous provincial temple, the
  shrine of Fortune at the little Latin town of Ferentinum, was hereditary.
  Among the most cherished treasures of this place was an ancient dagger with
  which a family legend was connected. In the days when the Gauls had captured
  Rome and were desolating Italy, a Scænvinus had struck down with this weapon
  the leader of a band of the barbarians which had cone to plunder the temple.
  His descendant now took it down from its place on the walls with much
  formality, and carried it about with him, not without throwing hints of some
  great achievement for which it was destined.</p>

  <p>This, unfortunately, was only the beginning of follies. On the evening of
  the 18th of April he invited his freedmen to a sumptuous dinner, to which he
  carefully gave the character of a farewell entertainment. During the repast
  he was by turns obstreperously gay and depressed even to tears. After dinner
  he followed up the usual libation to the gods by drinking to the memories of
  the Elder and the Younger Brutus. This done he drew the sacred dagger from
  its sheath and handed it to the most trusted of his freedmen, Milichus by
  name, with the injunction to get it sharpened. "Mind," he said at the same
  time, "that you see to the point, that it be properly sharp, for it has a
  great work to do." When the weapon was brought back he had other instructions
  scarcely less significant to give.</p>

  <p>"See, Milichus," he said to the freedman, "that you have plenty of
  bandages ready. One can never tell how soon they may be wanted."</p>

  <p>The bandages duly provided, he proceeded to execute with the usual
  solemnities a new will. When this had been signed and sealed, he seemed still
  unsatisfied. "Why," he said to his guests, "should you wait for my death
  before you can enjoy my liberality, though indeed you will very likely not
  have to wait long."</p>

  <p>Two favourite slaves were called up and set free. To others he gave
  presents of money. To the freedmen at his table he distributed keepsakes,
  rings, bracelets, writing-tablets, and valuables of all sorts. He might have
  been a father on his deathbed bidding farewell to his children with an
  appropriate remembrance of each. And this was the more remarkable because
  Scævinus, in ordinary life, was not a particularly generous person.</p>

  <p>For some time Milichus had noticed a curious change in his patron's
  demeanour. Ordinarily, as has been said, Scævinus was not a man who took life
  seriously, and Milichus' sole employment had been to minister to his
  pleasures. For some months past all this had been changed. He had, to a
  certain extent, reformed his ways, and had assumed a more than proportionate
  gravity of demeanour. Not infrequently he had dropped hints of important
  business which he had in hand, and great functions in the State which he
  might be called upon to perform.</p>

  <p>If these things had not aroused definite suspicions in Milichus they had
  certainly prepared him to entertain them when he witnessed the proceedings
  just related. That his patron had something on his mind, and that this
  something was approaching a critical time, he now felt convinced. When,
  shortly before midnight, Scævinus dismissed him with an unusually
  affectionate good- night, he resolved to take his wife into counsel.</p>

  <p>The two discussed the matter for a long time. The woman was far more
  decided than her husband in her views, both of what was going on and of what
  he ought to do. "Depend upon it," she said, "this is a big thing, and means a
  chance for you and me such as we never had before, and are not likely to have
  again. My belief is that there is something on foot against people who are
  very high up indeed. Go to the palace at once,&mdash;that is my
  advice,&mdash;and tell the people there what you have seen."</p>

  <p>The freedman hesitated. He had a feeling of kindness for his patron,
  stronger, perhaps, than he would have had for a better man. Scævinus had
  given him his liberty, had made him some handsome presents, and treated him
  generally with the kindness which commonly goes a long way further than
  money. It was always an odious thing for a freedman to turn against his
  patron; in his case it was particularly hateful. And then, if the whole
  business should turn out to have meant nothing at all! That would mean simple
  ruin and disgrace.</p>

  <p>The wife took a more severely practical view of the situation. Of the
  personal feeling she made no account whatever. Naturally she did not share it
  herself, for Scævinus was almost a stranger to her. Anyhow she was sure that
  it must not stand in the way of business. Of the risk of being found to have
  made a groundless charge she made light. The circumstances were too
  suspicious. They must mean something. She wound up with the most cogent
  argument of all. "There were others present, you say, freedmen and slaves. Do
  you suppose that you were the only one who saw anything strange in the
  Senator's behaviour? If you don't go to the palace, you may depend upon it
  some one else will. And if anybody anticipates you, where will you be? It was
  you to whom he gave the dagger to sharpen; you who had to prepare the
  bandages; it is you, therefore, who are bound to speak. You won't save your
  patron by holding your tongue, you will only lose your own chance, and very
  likely involve yourself in his ruin."</p>

  <p>This reasoning was too much for Milichus. "I will go," he said, "though I
  hate it."</p>

  <p>"And at once," cried the wife. "There is not a moment to be lost."</p>

  <p>The energetic woman seized him by the arm, and hurried him off. The day
  was just beginning to dawn, and it was only just light when the two reached
  the Pavilion gardens, where Nero was residing. At that untimely hour they had
  some difficulty in making themselves heard, and the porter, when roused,
  summarily bade them go about their business. Milichus would gladly have
  availed himself of the excuse, and postponed his odious task, but his wife
  was made of sterner stuff. She warned the doorkeeper that if he refused to
  admit them, he would do so at his own peril; they had come, she said, on
  urgent business, in fact, on a matter of life or death. Thus urged, the man
  gave way, and admitted the visitors, feeling that he would thus at least
  shift the responsibility from off his own shoulders. He sent the couple on to
  Epaphroditus, who may be described as the Emperor's Private Secretary.</p>

  <p>Epaphroditus heard the outline of Milichus' story, and recognizing the
  gravity of the facts, determined that Nero himself should hear them without
  delay.</p>

  <p>At first the Emperor was but little disposed to believe. He had a profound
  belief in his own inviolability, and the breaking down of the charge which
  Proculus had brought against Epicharis, had confirmed him in his incredulity.
  The sight of the dagger which Milichus, at his wife's suggestion, had brought
  with him, rather staggered him. It proved nothing, it is true. Still the
  sight of an actual weapon, which it was possible might be used against
  himself, seemed to make the whole thing closer and more real.</p>

  <p>"Send for Scævinus," he said to his Secretary. "Let us confront him with
  this fellow, and hear what he has to say."</p>

  <p>Scævinus, who had just risen from his bed, and was already disturbed by
  finding that Milichus had gone, no one knew whither, and had taken the dagger
  with him, was still further alarmed by the arrival of a quaternion of
  soldiers, bearing an order for his arrest. When, however, he was brought
  within the Emperor's presence, his courage rose to the occasion. The story of
  the dagger he ridiculed.</p>

  <p>"It belongs to my family," he said, and briefly told the story connected
  with it. "I found that it was being devoured by rust, and took it down from
  the wall. I may have told this fellow to clean it, but certainly said nothing
  else. As for the bandages, that is a pure fiction, invented to back up the
  other story. As for the new will, I have often made wills, as any of my
  friends can testify; as for the presents that I made to my freedmen and
  slaves, what is there in that? It is my way to be liberal to them, perhaps
  beyond my means. Answer me, Milichus," he went on, turning to the informer,
  "have you not had money and valuables from me many times?"</p>

  <p>The freedman acknowledged that this was so.</p>

  <p>"And now, Cæsar," said Scævinus, "to be perfectly frank, as indeed the
  occasion demands, I have a special reason for being generous, if it is
  generous to give what is scarcely one's own. My affairs are not prosperous,
  and my creditors have begun to press me. Legacies would be of no use if there
  should be a balance on the wrong side when my estate is wound up; services
  have been rendered me which it was a matter of honour to repay, and I felt
  that I could do it only by gifts."</p>

  <p>The accused spoke so calmly and coolly, and with such an appearance of
  frankness, that the Emperor was staggered.</p>

  <p>"It is the Epicharis case over again," he said to Tigellinus, who had by
  this time been summoned. "People seem to be making a trade of these lying
  accusations. They shall find that they are not to my taste."</p>

  <p>Scævinus saw his advantage, and pursued it. "I ask you, Cæsar, to protect
  me against the unfaithfulness and falsehood of this man, this villain, who
  owes to me all that he has, and now seeks to raise himself higher on the
  ruins of my fortune. About other things I care not so much, but it is
  terrible that he should seek to make a profit for himself out of the loss of
  my honour. Cæsar, I implore your protection against him."</p>

  <p>"And you shall have it, Scævinus," said the Emperor. "As for you," he went
  on in a voice of thunder, turning to the freedman, "you have a patron who is
  far too good for you. Henceforth he will treat you, I hope, as you deserve.
  He has my leave to squeeze out of you again all that he has given you, to the
  uttermost drop. Assuredly it was the unhappiest hour of your life when you
  came to me with this cock-and-bull story of a dagger and bandages. And now,
  Tigellinus," he went on, "it is time to be getting ready for the Circus."</p>

  <p>The freedman stood struck dumb with disappointment and dismay. But his
  wife did not lose her courage and presence of mind.</p>

  <p>"Ask him," she whispered, "whether he has not lately had many conferences
  with Natalis, and whether he is not an intimate friend of Caius Piso's."</p>

  <p>The freedman caught eagerly at the suggestion. "Cæsar," said he, "ask
  Scævinus what dealings he has lately had with Natalis and Caius Piso."</p>

  <p>Scævinus could not repress a start when he heard the names of two of the
  most prominent conspirators thus openly joined with his own, and the start
  did not escape the watchful eye of Tigellinus.</p>

  <p>"There may be more in this, Sire, than you think," he whispered in Nero's
  ear. "Natalis is a notorious busy-body, and Piso is the most dangerous man in
  Rome."</p>

  <p>"What do you advise, then?" asked the Emperor, impressed by his Minister's
  earnestness.</p>

  <p>"Send for Natalis," replied Tigellinus, "and question him; but don't
  question him in the presence of the accused. Ask them separately what they
  have been interesting themselves in; if there is anything that they don't
  want to have known, they will certainly contradict each other."</p>

  <p>The suggestion was immediately carried out. Natalis, arrested just as he
  was setting out for the Circus, and having a dagger actually concealed upon
  his person, lost his presence of mind. Interrogated by Tigellinus as to the
  business discussed at recent interviews with Scævinus, with a scribe sitting
  close by to take down his words, he hesitated and stammered. His invention
  seemed to fail him as well as his courage. At last he managed to blunder out
  a few words to the effect that Scævinus had been consulting him about the
  best way of investing some sums of money which would shortly be coming in to
  him from the paying off of sundry mortgages and loans. This was a peculiarly
  unlucky venture in the face of Scævinus' recent confession of poverty.
  Tigellinus smiled an evil smile as he listened. Natalis caught the look, and
  stammered worse than ever, for he knew that he had blundered.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, my friend," said the Minister in the blandest of voices. "I am
  sure that the Senator Scævinus is a lucky man to have so admirable an
  adviser. Still you will pardon me for saying that you are a trifle obscure in
  your description. It will be instructive to call in the Senator himself, and
  hear his account of the matter."</p>

  <p>Scævinus accordingly was brought in. The look of terror which came over
  his face as soon as he caught sight of Natalis was as good as a confession.
  Tigellinus, who hated him, as he hated every man better born and better bred
  than himself, smiled again.</p>

  <p>"The Emperor," he began, in his soft, unctuous voice, "who feels a
  paternal interest in the affairs of his subjects, is anxious to know what was
  the subject of discussion when you were closeted yesterday so long with our
  friend Natalis."</p>

  <p>Scævinus, who had by this time recovered his self-possession, answered
  without hesitation. His course was, it need hardly be said, clear before him.
  Indeed, he congratulated himself on the happy thought of having pleaded his
  poverty to the Emperor.</p>

  <p>"I was consulting my friend about raising a loan on more moderate interest
  than what I am now paying." The Emperor laughed outright.</p>

  <p>"Scribe," said Tigellinus to the slave who had been taking down the
  depositions in shorthand&mdash;for shorthand was an art well known to the
  Romans by that time,&mdash;"scribe, read aloud the answer of Antonius
  Natalis."</p>

  <p>"One of you has certainly lied," said Tigellinus, "and probably both; but
  there are means of making you speak the truth."</p>

  <p>He made a sign to a guard who stood at the door of the apartment. In a few
  minutes half-a-dozen slaves appeared, bringing with them a rack and other
  instruments of torture.</p>

  <p>Scævinus started at the sight. "Cæsar," he cried, "is this with your
  permission? Torture to a Senator of Rome!"</p>

  <p>"Silence, villain!" said the Minister. "You know that when the life of the
  Emperor is concerned&mdash;and what else meant you by the dagger?&mdash;all
  means of discovering the truth are permitted by the law."</p>

  <p>The slaves began to prepare the rack for use. Natalis lost all his
  fortitude at the ghastly sound of the creaking beams, as the executioners
  worked the hideous thing backwards and forwards to see that it was in
  order.</p>

  <p>"Spare me, Caesar," he cried, falling on his knees, "and I will confess
  all that I know."</p>

  <p>Scævinus was not so lost to shame. He hesitated. He was even ready, if his
  companion had backed him up, to brave it out. But the cowardice of the other
  was contagious. If Natalis was to save himself by confession, why not he? His
  friends were lost anyhow; they would not fare one whit the worse for anything
  that he might say.</p>

  <p>"Caesar," he said, still striving to keep up some show of dignity, "if you
  will deign to listen, I have something to say."</p>

  <p>Tigellinus gloated with malignant pleasure over the man's useless
  humiliation. A Senator, offering to betray his friends and refused! What
  could be more welcome hearing to a parvenu!</p>

  <p>"Nay, sir," he said; "we must observe due precedence. Every man according
  to his rank. In honourable things the Senator before the knight; in
  dishonourable the knight before the Senator. Is not that so, Sire?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Nero; "speak on, Antonius Natalis. Meanwhile let our
  honourable Senator be removed. It has already been very interesting to
  observe how his account of things differed from his confederate's, and it may
  be interesting again."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap22"
     name="chap22"></a>XXII. &mdash; VACILLATION</h2>

  <p class="first">SCAEVINUS &mdash; for we must do the poor cowardly wretch
  such justice as he deserves &mdash; had made an effort to save his friends,
  and, one ought perhaps to add, himself. While Natalis was being interrogated,
  he entered into conversation with the slave who had been told off to attend
  on him. The slave was a young man of mixed Greek and Asiatic race, with an
  extremely intelligent countenance, but sickly and lame. It was impossible for
  any one with the least insight into character to look at him and to hear him
  speak without perceiving that there was something out of the common about
  him. In after years he was to become one of the most notable exponents of the
  Stoic philosophy, for this Phrygian cripple was no less a person than the
  philosopher Epictetus. At the time of which I am writing he was only a feeble
  lad with, however, a certain air of ability and courage which greatly
  impressed an intelligent observer. Scævinus, feeling that his situation was
  practically desperate, resolved to make a last effort. If it failed he could
  hardly be in a worse position than the present; if it succeeded it was just
  possible that the fortunes of the conspiracy might yet be retrieved.</p>

  <p>"Can you take a message for me to a friend?" he said in Greek to
  Epictetus.</p>

  <p>The soldiers who were guarding the door of the apartment heard without
  understanding.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said the slave, "if any good is to be achieved."</p>

  <p>"You shall have ten gold pieces for your trouble."</p>

  <p>"Nay, this is a thing which I would sooner do without payment. That is not
  only more honourable, but also more safe."</p>

  <p>"I cannot write it, indeed, there is no need; all that is needed can be
  said in a few words. Go to Caius Piso, and say to him, 'All is discovered;
  act.' And mind&mdash;not a word of this to any one else. Let not wild horses
  wring it out of you. That would be fatal to both you and me."</p>

  <p>The slave smiled. "They might as well try to wring words out of a stump or
  a stone. For, indeed, what else is a slave? When my old master kicked me and
  broke my leg&mdash;" and he held out as he spoke the maimed limb&mdash;"I
  said, 'Why do you damage your own property?' So I should say to them. If they
  choose to kill me, that is their own lookout; all that concerns me, for a
  slave has something of a man about him after all, as Aristotle says, is that
  I don't dishonour myself."</p>

  <p>When Scævinus was recalled into the Emperor's audience-chamber, Epictetus
  lost no time in making his way to Piso's house. Some of the prominent persons
  connected with the conspiracy were assembled, and were busy making their
  final arrangements for the proceedings of the day.</p>

  <p>Epictetus, as soon as he was safe within the doors, wrote down on a tablet
  the following words: "The bearer of a message from Scævinus asks for
  admission." He was brought up without loss of time into an ante-chamber,
  where Piso saw him alone. He delivered his message, and immediately
  departed.</p>

  <p>Piso rejoined his assembled friends, and told them what had happened.
  Subrius, with characteristic promptitude, rose to the occasion.</p>

  <p>"Piso," he said, "the task before us is different from that which we had
  planned,&mdash;different and possibly more difficult, but certainly not
  hopeless. We shall not proclaim you Emperor after Nero is dead; we shall have
  to proclaim you while he is yet alive. And I must own that the affair is now
  more to my taste than it was. I was ready, as you know, to play the assassin,
  when it was a question of delivering the human race from a tyrant; but I
  would sooner play the soldier, and meet him in the field. That, Piso, is what
  we must do. Let us go to the Forum, and appeal to the people, or, as I would
  rather advise, to the camp, and appeal to the soldiers. In both places, among
  both audiences, we shall have friends. They will shout their applause, and
  others, who at present know nothing of the matter, will join in. That is a
  line of action for which, depend upon it, Nero is not prepared. Even brave
  men are sometimes confounded by so sudden an attack; how will a stage-playing
  Emperor and his miserable minion encounter it? Don't think for a moment that
  we can escape; there are too many in the secret. Some one will be sure to
  sell his honour for money, or find his courage ooze away in the presence of
  the rack. Indeed, we know that the treachery has begun. Let us act, and at
  once, for even while I am urging you on, opportunities are passing away."</p>

  <p>These spirited words made no impression on Piso's somewhat sluggish and
  inactive nature. He was one of those men who are slow to move from their
  course, and have an inexhaustible supply of passive endurance. He shrugged
  his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"The Empire," he said, "does not approve itself to me if it is to be won
  in a street broil."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said the soldier. "It would be more seemly, I acknowledge,
  if the Senate, headed by the Magistrates, and the Prefects, and Tribunes of
  the Prætorians, with the Vestal Virgins in the front of the whole procession,
  were to come and salute you as Emperor. But that is not the question. The
  question is this: You have two alternatives; think which suits your dignity,
  your name, your ancestors, the better. One is to put your fortune to the
  trial, if things go well, to be the successor of Augustus; if the fates will
  otherwise, to die, sword in hand. The other is to wait here till Nero's
  myrmidons come to chain you, to drag you off to the place of execution; or,
  if the tyrant strains his prerogative of mercy to the utmost, to suffer you
  to fall on your own sword, or open your own veins."</p>

  <p>Piso heard unmoved. His courage was of the passive kind. He could meet
  death when it came with an undaunted face, but he could not go, so to speak,
  to seek it.</p>

  <p>"The gods have declared against us, and I shall not resist their will. I
  thank you for your good-will and your counsel; but you must permit a Piso to
  judge for himself what best suits his own dignity and the glory of his
  ancestors. I am determined to await my fate."</p>

  <p>The bold spirit of the Tribune was not crushed, nor his resources
  exhausted by this failure. There was still a possible claimant to the throne
  in Lateranus. He had not, it is true, the pretensions of Piso, neither his
  personal popularity nor his noble birth. Still, he had courage, favour with
  some classes of the people, and a commanding presence. Here another
  disappointment awaited him. Lateranus had been arrested. Apparently, Nero had
  had the same thought that had occurred to the Prætorian, that the Consul-
  elect was among the dangerous characters of Rome. The house was in the utmost
  confusion; indeed, the soldiers had only just left it. Subrius' inquiries
  were answered by the Chamberlain. He, poor man, came wringing his hands and
  weeping, overwhelmed, it was evident, by terror and grief. "Ah! my poor
  master," he said; "we shall never see him again. They hurried him off without
  a moment's notice."</p>

  <p>"Who?" asked the soldier.</p>

  <p>"Statius the Tribune," replied the Chamberlain, "who had some twenty men
  with him. He would not give him time even to say good by to his children. And
  when my poor master said, 'If I must die, let me die by my own hand,' even
  that was refused him. 'We allow nothing to traitors,' the brute answered.
  They bound him hand and foot and dragged him off."</p>

  <p>"We allow nothing to traitors, indeed," murmured Subrius to himself.
  "What, I wonder, does Statius call himself? I hope that he, anyhow, will get
  his deserts."</p>

  <p>Statius, it should be said, had been one of the most active promoters of
  the conspiracy.</p>

  <p>Again the Tribune's hopes were dashed to the ground. Still he refused to
  think that all was lost. A last chance remained. The conspiracy had spread
  widely among his brother officers of the Prætorians; and they, at least, he
  hoped, would make a struggle for their lives. Civilians might be content to
  fold their arms and bare their necks to the sword of the executioner, but
  soldiers would die, if die they must, with arms in their hands. And then, if
  they wanted a great name to catch the popular ear, was there not Seneca? I
  don't think much of philosophers," Subrius thought to himself, "but perhaps I
  may be wrong. Anyhow, the men of the world have failed us. They are as weak
  as water. Perhaps there may be sterner stuff in the man of books."</p>

  <p>Obviously there was no time to be lost. He must hurry to the Prætorian
  camp at once, and urge Fænius Rufus, who was one of the joint Prefects, and,
  as we know, was involved in the conspiracy, to act.</p>

  <p>Calling to the driver of a car which was plying for hire, he proceeded at
  the utmost speed to which the horse could be put, to the camp. Just outside
  the gate he met the officer of whom he was in search.</p>

  <p>Rufus, who was on horseback, and was followed by an escort of ten
  troopers, signed to his brother officer to halt. "Well met, Subrius!" he
  cried. "I am on my way to the palace, and I want you to come with me. Give
  the Tribune your horse," he went on, turning to the orderly who was riding
  behind him; "go back and get a fresh mount for yourself, and come on after
  us."</p>

  <p>The man dismounted and held the horse while the Tribune jumped into the
  saddle.</p>

  <p>"Not a word," whispered the Prefect to his companion, as they rode along;
  "not a word; we must brave it out, and all may yet be well. But leave it to
  me.</p>

  <p>The Tribune had no choice but to obey. His superior officer's conduct was
  unintelligible, even astounding. Still he could do nothing. It would have
  been sheer madness for him, a simple Tribune, to stand up in the camp and bid
  the Prætorians abandon the Emperor. If such a movement was to begin at all it
  must begin with the Prefect. Meanwhile, he could only obey orders and possess
  his soul in patience.</p>

  <p>Rufus, anxious, it would seem, not to give his subordinate a chance of any
  further speech, beckoned to the Centurion who was in command of the escort,
  and kept him in conversation till they reached the palace gates.</p>

  <p>The two Prætorians were ushered into the chamber where Nero had just taken
  his seat, and was preparing to examine some of the prisoners who had been
  named by the informers. The Emperor was evidently in a state of great
  agitation and alarm, and Subrius observed that the detachment of the
  body-guard in attendance was exclusively composed of Germans. He hardly knew
  whether the circumstance was encouraging or not. For the present, indeed, it
  would make any attempt very difficult, if not impossible, but it was an
  ominous thing for Nero if he had begun to find that only barbarians could be
  trusted.</p>

  <p>The Emperor signed to Rufus to take a seat immediately on his left hand,
  the chair on the right being occupied by Tigellinus. Subrius himself sat
  immediately below his superior officer, and within a few feet of the
  Emperor.</p>

  <p>The prisoner under examination at the moment was the poet Lucan. The
  Emperor and Tigellinus had been questioning him for some time, but hitherto
  with little or no result. He had denied all knowledge of the conspiracy.
  Still the keen eyes of his judges had not failed to perceive signs of waning
  courage. Nero whispered to Tigellinus, and the Minister beckoned to an
  attendant. The man drew aside a curtain and revealed the rack.</p>

  <p>"Marcus Annacus Lucanus," said Tigellinus, using almost the same words
  that he had addressed to Scævinus, "when the life of the Emperor is at stake,
  the law permits and even enjoins all means of discovering the truth."</p>

  <p>The wretched man turned pale. Still he made an effort to brave it out.
  "You are more likely to wring out falsehood than truth by such means," he
  said in a faint voice.</p>

  <p>"Of that you must leave us to judge," answered Tigellinus with a
  sneer.</p>

  <p>The executioner advanced and laid his hand on the prisoner's shoulder. He
  started at the touch, and grew ghastly pale.</p>

  <p>"Cæsar," he cried, appealing as a last chance to the feelings of the
  Emperor, "Cæsar, we were once friends, and worshipped the Muses together.
  Will you suffer this?"</p>

  <p>Nero only smiled. He had long ago steeled his heart against pity. Lucan he
  hated with that especially bitter hatred which wounded vanity sometimes
  inspires. He aspired to be a poet, as he aspired to be an actor, a singer, a
  charioteer, and he could not conceal from himself that the author of the
  Pharsalia far surpassed him.</p>

  <p>Then the unhappy man's courage broke down. "Stop!" he cried, "I will
  confess. I am guilty of conspiring against the Emperor."</p>

  <p>"That we know," said Tigellinus. "What we want to hear from you is the
  names of your confederates."</p>

  <p>"Must I speak, Cæsar?" moaned the wretched man. "Is it not enough that I
  have confessed the crime myself?"</p>

  <p>"You have confessed nothing," said Nero. "Your guilt I knew already. And
  you I could afford to despise, for you can only strike with your pen, but
  doubtless you know others who know how to use their swords."</p>

  <p>Lucan then gave two or three names, all of them, as it happened, already
  known.</p>

  <p>"Still we have learnt nothing new from you," said Tigellinus. "If you wish
  to merit the Emperor's clemency, you must tell us something that we have not
  heard before."</p>

  <p>In a voice half stifled with shame the accused said: "My mother knew of
  the affair almost as soon as I did."</p>

  <p>A thrill of disgust went through the audience as these humiliating words
  were uttered. Even to these men, hardened as they were, the son who could
  betray his own mother seemed a monster.</p>

  <p>"That is enough," cried the Emperor, making a sign to a Centurion; "remove
  him!"</p>

  <p>A shameful scene of baseness and cowardice followed. One after another the
  accused were brought before the tribunal; one after another they failed in
  the hour of trial. Men of noble birth, men who had served their country in
  high offices, and who had distinguished themselves in the field, could not
  summon up courage enough to endure this ordeal. Some volunteered confession,
  and neither force, nor even the threat of force, was needed to make them
  betray their comrades. Others stood firm at first, but failed when they were
  confronted with the engines of torture. Subrius sat filled with a disgust and
  a shame which hardly left him time to think of his own danger, as friend
  after friend, men of courage and honour as he had always believed them to be,
  proved themselves to be traitors and cowards.</p>

  <p>As for the behaviour of Rufus, he watched it with ever increasing
  astonishment. The Prefect took an active part in the examination. Not even
  Tigellinus was more truculent, more savage, more brutal. He cross-examined
  the prisoners, he plied them with threats, and still by a strange agreement
  in silence, his name was not mentioned by one of them.</p>

  <p>"What is his plan?" thought Subrius to himself. "Can he hope that he will
  escape altogether, that no one out of these scores of accomplices will name
  him, or is he biding his time?"</p>

  <p>"Tigellinus," said Nero to his Minister, after some six or seven
  confessions had been taken, "do you remember that Greek freedwoman whom
  Proculus accused? Let her be brought before us again. Perhaps she may have a
  different story to tell. Meanwhile, while she is being fetched, we will
  adjourn for a brief space. A cup of Falernian will not be ungrateful after
  this morning's work."</p>

  <p>He rose from his seat, and left the Court, leaning on the arm of
  Tigellinus. The Prefect of the Prætorians followed immediately behind, and
  the Tribune, again, was close to his commanding officer. Behind these again
  were some dozen German body-guards.</p>

  <p>"Is this the chance that he has been waiting for?" said Subrius to
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Shall I strike?" he whispered to the Prefect, laying his hand on the hilt
  of his sword.</p>

  <p>Rufus hesitated for a moment. That there was an opportunity such as never
  might occur again, he saw; the chances were ten to one that if Subrius were
  to strike, he would not strike in vain. But then, could he hope to escape
  himself if the deed was done? The German body-guards were devoted to their
  master, and would infallibly avenge his death on his assassin, and, it could
  hardly be doubted, on himself.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" he whispered to his subordinate. "It is not the time; we shall
  have a better opportunity than this."</p>

  <p>Subrius muttered a curse under his breath, but the habit of obedience was
  strong in him, and he held his hand.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap23"
     name="chap23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; A LAST CHANCE</h2>

  <p class="first">SUBRIUS was on duty that afternoon in the camp, and his
  place in the Court, where the Prefect was still in attendance, was filled by
  another Tribune. No one who saw him going, with an imperturbable calm,
  through the numberless little details which had to be looked after by the
  Tribune on duty, would have imagined how much he had at stake. The fact was
  that he had hardened his heart to any fortune, while he was both by temper of
  mind and by deliberate conviction a Stoic and a fatalist. Still he could not
  help feeling what may be described rather as a vivid curiosity than an
  anxiety as to what the day might bring forth. The Greek freedwoman who was
  being examined that afternoon, whatever she knew of the conspiracy, whether
  it was little or much, anyhow knew his name. Would she keep the secret? It
  was scarcely likely. He had seen men, who had every motive of honour and
  affection to keep them silent, quailing under the threats of pain, and
  sacrificing everything in their desperate clinging to life; would this weak
  woman, who had no honourable traditions of birth and training to which she
  would be bound, show herself braver and more faithful than soldiers and
  nobles? Who could imagine it? And yet when he thought of that strong,
  resolute face he thought it not impossible.</p>

  <p>And he was right. He was making his way to his quarters when he
  encountered the officer who had been occupying his place in the Court during
  the afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Subrius," said his friend, "you have missed the strangest sight that ever
  man saw. Ah! and I wish that I had missed it too, for it was almost past
  bearing. A Greek freedwoman was brought before the Court&mdash;Epicharis was
  her name. It seems that she had been accused of conspiring against the
  Emperor some time ago, but that nothing could be proved against her then; now
  that all this has come out, she was to be examined again. One of the
  Secretaries read over the confessions of the prisoners who had been before
  the Court in the morning, and then Tigellinus said: 'You hear this. What have
  you to say?' 'Nothing,' she answered. Well, he went on asking questions. 'Had
  she ever heard anything about the affair? How could she account for all these
  confessions? She had declared that Proculus had invented his story; was it
  likely that all these witnesses, knights, Senators, and soldiers, had also
  invented theirs?' She went on answering, 'I know nothing about it,' or was
  silent. Before long, Tigellinus broke out, 'You have lost your memory, woman,
  it seems; well, we have charms for bringing it back.' At the same time he
  made a sign to a slave that stood by and the man uncovered the instruments of
  torture. I assure you that the girl&mdash;she was only a girl&mdash;did not
  so much as flinch or start. Well, they put her on the rack, and the
  executioner gave it a turn. I assure you it makes me almost sick when I think
  of it. At the second turn the woman said, 'I have something to say.' 'Ah,
  madam!' cried Tigellinus, 'I thought we should find your tongue for you.
  Loose her!' The men took her off the rack, and set her in a chair; she was
  quite unable to stand. 'Cæsar,' she said, 'since you are resolved to force
  the truth from me, you shall have it. I have conspired against your life, and
  had I been a man, and had had the opportunities which others have had, I had
  done more; I would not only have plotted, but would have struck. Would you
  know why? Because you are a murderer. You slew your wife Octavia because she
  was ten thousand times too good for you. It is she whom I would have avenged.
  The gods have willed it otherwise; they have assigned the task to other
  hands. You may kill me as you will. I do not care to live. But do not flatter
  yourself that the Furies of your mother, your brother, your wife, will suffer
  you to rest. They will find some sword to reach your heart, though this has
  been broken.' By Mars! Subrius, the woman looked like a Fury herself as she
  said this. She had started up from her chair, though how she could stand I
  cannot imagine, and poured out her words as if she were inspired. The Emperor
  seemed struck dumb, but Tigellinus cried, 'Gag her; cut out her tongue!'
  Before they could touch her, she said again, 'Would you know my associates?'
  Tigellinus made a sign that they were to leave her alone. She was so frantic,
  he thought, that she might let out something almost without knowing it. 'I
  will tell you; my associates are all brave soldiers, all good citizens, all
  who love their country. To-morrow, Cæsar, if not to-day, these will be on my
  side, and they will be too strong for you, for all your legions. Mark my
  words: before five years are past, you will desire and yet be afraid to die,
  and will hardly find a friend to press home the last blow!'"</p>

  <p>"Brave woman!" said Subrius, "and what then?"</p>

  <p>"After that," replied the other, "she said nothing more. Not a single word
  could they wring out of her lips, though they tortured her in a way that, as
  I said, made me sick to see. At last the physician told them that unless they
  stopped they would kill her. So she was carried off, to be brought back again
  to-morrow, I understood."</p>

  <p>"Great Jupiter! how she shames us all," said Subrius to himself, when he
  had parted from his brother officer. "To think of the shameful exhibition
  that those freeborn men made yesterday, and then see what this woman has
  done! And what of myself? Would she&mdash;had she been in my place&mdash;hold
  her hand? And yet I was bound to obey orders. The gods grant I may find Rufus
  in a bolder mood at last!"</p>

  <p>This bolder mood unhappily was what not even the necessity of his
  desperate position could create in the Prefect. Subrius found him still
  unwilling to act, clinging frantically to the hope that his share in the
  conspiracy might yet pass undiscovered. In vain did Subrius ply him with
  arguments and remonstrances.</p>

  <p>"It is sheer madness," he said, after going again and again over the
  familiar ground; "nothing but madness, to hope that you will not be named by
  some one of the condemned. It is a marvel that it has not been done already.
  But if you think that they will all endure to see you sitting as their judge,
  cross- examining, threatening, when by a word they might bring you down to
  stand at their side, you are simply fooling yourself. Why should they spare
  you?"</p>

  <p>"If any one does name me, I can deny it," said Rufus.</p>

  <p>"Deny it!" cried the Tribune; "what good will that do you? Nero is so
  panic- stricken that to be named to him is to be condemned. And what of
  Tigellinus? Don't you know that he has a protegé of his own for whom he
  covets your place?"</p>

  <p>"It is my only chance," murmured the Prefect. "It is too late for anything
  else."</p>

  <p>"Possibly," returned Subrius gloomily; "we have lost too many chances, and
  this is a fault which Fortune never forgives. But it is not too late to die;
  that is the only thing, I take it, that our folly has left us free to do. Let
  us cast lots who shall play the executioner. We shall do it at least in a
  more seemly fashion than Nero's hangsman."</p>

  <p>At this moment there was a tap at the door. The Prefect turned pale; any
  moment, he knew in his heart of hearts, might bring with it his arrest.
  Subrius put his hand upon his sword-hilt, ready to sell his life as clearly
  as he could.</p>

  <p>The newcomer was another Tribune of the Prætorians, Silvanus by name.</p>

  <p>"Well, Silvanus, what news?" asked Rufus.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you," replied the other, "and you must judge what is to be
  done. Yesterday Cæsar sent for me, after he had finished his examination of
  the prisoners. Tigellinus was with him, and Poppæa; Antonius Natalis was
  there, with handcuffs on his hands, and a soldier on each side of him.
  'Repeat, Natalis,' said Cæsar, 'what you have told us about Seneca.' At that
  Natalis said: 'I went lately to see Seneca when he was sick. Piso sent me. I
  was to complain of Seneca's having always denied himself to him of late. They
  were old friends; he had much to say to Seneca; it would be greatly to their
  mutual profit if he were allowed an opportunity of saying it. I took this
  message to Seneca,' Natalis went on. 'His answer was that he did not agree
  with Piso, but thought, on the contrary, that it would not be to the interest
  of either of them that they should have much talk. He quite saw, however,
  that he and Piso must stand and fall together.' When Natalis had finished,
  Cæsar said to me, 'You hear, Silvanus, the evidence of Natalis.' 'Yes, Sire,'
  I said, 'I hear.' 'It shows plainly that there was an understanding between
  them,' the Emperor went on. 'Is it not so?' 'Doubtless, Sire,' I said, for
  one does not contradict an Emperor, you know. 'Well,' he went on, 'go to
  Seneca, repeat that evidence to him,&mdash;to make sure that you have it
  right, you had better put it into writing,&mdash;and ask him how he can
  explain it. Of course you will take a guard with you!' Well, I went. Seneca,
  who had just come back from Baiæ, was at his house, between the Anio and the
  Mons Sacer, and when I got there was at dinner with his wife and two friends.
  I read Natalis' evidence to him. He said: 'It is quite true that Natalis came
  to me from Piso with a complaint that I denied myself to him. I said that I
  really was not well enough to see any but a very few friends; indeed, the
  physicians prescribe absolute rest; of course, if the Emperor wants me, I
  must come, but I cannot be expected to sacrifice my life for any one else. As
  to what I am reported to have said about Piso and myself standing and falling
  together, I don't understand it. I may have given the common message, "If
  Piso is well, I am well," but I never went beyond it. That is all I have to
  say,' he went on, 'and if Cæsar does not know by this time that I am in the
  habit of speaking the truth, nothing that I can say will persuade him.' Well,
  I went back; when I reached the palace, Nero was at dinner with Tigellinus
  and Poppæa. I repeated Seneca's words exactly. I had taken the precaution, I
  should say, of writing them down. The Emperor said, 'Did the old man say
  anything about killing himself?' 'Nothing,' I said. We heard him mutter to
  himself, 'The old dotard is very slow to take a hint. What could be plainer?
  You are sure,' he said, turning to me again, 'you saw no signs of anything of
  the kind?' 'Nothing,' I answered; 'he was as calm and quiet as ever I saw a
  man in my life.' 'Well,' said Cæsar, 'then we must speak more plainly. Go
  back and tell him that he has three hours to live, and no more.' "</p>

  <p>"What then?" said the Prefect. "What did you do?"</p>

  <p>"Instead of going back, I came to you," replied Silvanus.</p>

  <p>"And why?" asked the Prefect.</p>

  <p>"Do you ask me why?" cried Silvanus. "Surely you must know. Am I to go or
  am I not to go? Say the word. I am ready to obey."</p>

  <p>At this point Subrius broke in. "Silvanus is right. He sees that this is
  our last chance. Piso is dead, Lateranus is dead. Seneca is the only man left
  whom we can put up with any hope against the tyrant. For Heaven's sake, away
  with this frantic folly of thinking that you can escape! Speak the word,
  Fænius Rufus, and I will go with Silvanus here to Seneca's house. We will
  take him, whether he will or not&mdash;for he is more likely to refuse than
  to consent&mdash;and bring him into the camp, and salute him as Emperor."</p>

  <p>"No! No!" cried the Prefect, wringing his hands in an agony of perplexity.
  "It is hopeless. It must fail!"</p>

  <p>"Anyhow," retorted the Tribune, "it is not so absolutely hopeless as your
  plan. We have lost better chances than this; but this has, at least, the
  merit of being our last."</p>

  <p>"I cannot do it," said Rufus after a pause. "Carry out your orders,
  Silvanus; there is nothing else to do."</p>

  <p>"So be it, then," said Subrius. "you have sealed our fate and your own. I
  will go with you, Silvanus. I would fain see how a philosopher can die; it
  will not be long before we shall need the lesson."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap24"
     name="chap24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; THE DEATH OF A PHILOSOPHER</h2>

  <p class="first">SCARCELY a word passed between the two Tribunes as they
  traversed the distance, some four miles or so, that lay between the camp and
  Seneca's villa. Silvanus was heartily ashamed of his errand, and Subrius, who
  bitterly felt his own helplessness, could only pity him, and would not say a
  word that might sound like a reproach. Under these circumstances to be silent
  was the only course. Arrived at the villa, Silvanus called a Centurion, took
  him apart, and gave him his instructions.</p>

  <p>"I shall not go in," he said to his companion. "It would be past all
  bearing."</p>

  <p>"You will not hinder my entering?" asked Subrius.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not, if it pleases you to go."</p>

  <p>Silvanus gave the necessary orders to the Centurion, and the two were
  ushered by a slave into the apartment where Seneca was sitting with his wife
  and his friends.</p>

  <p>The Centurion stepped forward and saluted. "Lucius Annacus Seneca," he
  said, "Cæsar, having come to the conclusion that it is not to the interests
  of the State that you should live any longer, graciously, of his clemency,
  permits you to choose for yourself the manner of your death."</p>

  <p>The unhappy wife of the doomed man uttered a loud shriek, and fell back
  half fainting in her chair; his two guests started up from their seats with
  pale and terror-stricken faces. Seneca remained absolutely calm and
  unmoved.</p>

  <p>"This," he said with a smile, "is not the usual fee that a pupil pays to
  his teacher, but it may not be the less acceptable, for that. Sir," he went
  on, turning with a courteous gesture to the Tribune, "is our friend, if I may
  call him so, who has just brought me this gift, under your command?"</p>

  <p>"The gods forbid!" cried Subrius eagerly. "I had never come on such an
  errand. Yet I knew that it was to be executed. Forgive me if I intrude
  unseasonably."</p>

  <p>"You need scarcely ask my pardon," replied the philosopher. "Condemned men
  are seldom troubled by a too great abundance of visitors and friends. How
  much time do you allow me, friend?" he asked, turning to the Centurion.</p>

  <p>The man hesitated. "Would two hours suffice?" he asked. "I would fain
  return to Cæsar before he sleeps."</p>

  <p>"Jupiter forbid," said Seneca, "that I should keep Cæsar from his needful
  rest! That would be ill-done of his old tutor. And surely two hours will
  suffice to rid an old man of what little life remains to him. But the time is
  not long, and I must not waste it. Let me see then what has to be done.
  First, then, my will."</p>

  <p>The Centurion interposed. "It is not permitted to any one so circumstanced
  to change his will."</p>

  <p>"Why so?"</p>

  <p>"Cæsar grants validity to the wills of those whom he suffers thus to
  execute justice on themselves, but his clemency must not be abused, possibly
  to his own injury, or the injury of loyal persons."</p>

  <p>"You mean that I might strike out a legacy that I had left to Cæsar
  himself, or to Tigellinus. Nay, I was but thinking to make my friends here a
  little present in remembrance of to-day. And to you, sir," he added,
  addressing the Centurion, "I would gladly have offered some little token of
  my regard. The bringers of good news should not miss their reward. But if it
  is otherwise ordered, we must obey. After all, the best thing that I have to
  leave to my friends is the picture of my life. Is it permitted to me to spend
  the time that remains in the company of my wife and friends? You can easily
  make sure of my not escaping."</p>

  <p>The Centurion intimated that there would be no objection to this, saluted,
  and withdrew.</p>

  <p>"You will stay with me, sir?" he said to Subrius; "though indeed it is
  presumption in a civilian to pretend to show a soldier how to die. Nay," he
  added, for the Prætorian, inexpressibly touched by the cheerful composure
  with which the old man met his fate, could hardly keep down his emotion,
  "Nay, but we look to you, who have faced death so often, to help us to be
  calm."</p>

  <p>He turned to his two friends, who were weeping unrestrainedly. "Surely I
  have been the dullest of masters if I have not taught you better than this.
  By all the gods! if you would not disgrace me, command yourselves better.
  Philosophers forsooth! and the moment your philosophy is wanted, it breaks
  down. Life is brief, and death is sure. These are the very commonplaces of
  wisdom, and yet one would think that you had never heard them. And what is
  there that surprises you? That an old man should die, and an old man whom
  Nero hates? The only marvel is that I have been suffered to live so long. He
  has murdered his brother, his mother, his wife; it was only fitting that he
  should murder his tutor. All that I taught him has perished; it is time for
  the teacher to follow the way of his precepts."</p>

  <p>The philosopher then turned to his wife Paulina. He changed his tone to
  one of tenderness.</p>

  <p>"Dearest," he said, as he clasped her in his arms, "we must part. That is
  a sorrow which all husbands and wives must face; and, after all, the tyrant
  has not anticipated fate by many years. I will not ask you not to grieve for
  me; that would be against nature; but it is also against nature to grieve
  without ceasing. The years that have been given us have not, I trust, been
  ill-spent; to recollect them is a solace of which no one can rob you."</p>

  <p>"Nay," cried Paulina, "I shall need no solace, for there shall be no
  parting. Nero bids you die, but he does not forbid me to die with you."</p>

  <p>"Well said," answered Seneca. "That is worthy of my own true wife. It was
  only right to show you that there might yet be happiness in life for you, but
  if you prefer the glory of death I must not hinder you. And yet," he added
  with a smile, "of any one but you I should be inclined to be jealous. You put
  me into the shade. I have no choice between living and dying. I do but prefer
  one death to another; but you prefer it to life."</p>

  <p>To open the artery in one of the arms was reckoned the easiest and least
  painful way of inflicting death. Husband and wife held out their arms
  together, and the former administered the stroke. For some reason it failed
  of its effect. Possibly in the case of the wife the old man's strength did
  not suffice to make the wound sufficiently deep. Anyhow she survived. It was
  to the interest of some of those who surrounded her that she should live.
  Accordingly the Centurion who was in waiting outside was informed of what had
  happened, and despatched a mounted messenger to Nero with an account of what
  had been done and a request for instructions. The man returned in a very
  short time with strict injunctions that the wife must not be permitted to
  die. The wound was bound up, and she survived, though as long as she lived
  the bloodless pallor of her face showed how near she had been to death.</p>

  <p>With Seneca himself the process of dying was long and painful. He could
  not bleed to death, it seems, for, what with the weakness of old age, and the
  excessive spareness of his diet, there was but little blood in his body. To
  no purpose did he sever the veins in his legs. Painful convulsions followed,
  but death still seemed remote.</p>

  <p>His fortitude remained unshaken. "If I cannot die," he said to his
  friends, "at least let me make use of life. Send me my secretaries."</p>

  <p>The secretaries came, and he dictated to them, in a voice that was
  surprisingly firm and distinct, his last thoughts about life and death. Never
  had his eloquence been more clear and forcible.</p>

  <p>He had just finished when a newcomer was announced. This was the physician
  Annæus Statius, a long-tried and faithful friend, who had been Seneca's
  medical attendant for many years. The philosopher's chamberlain had sent for
  him as soon as he was aware of the errand on which the soldiers had come.</p>

  <p>"You are come in good time, Statius," said Seneca. "Your art has so
  fortified me against death that when I want to depart I cannot. Have you the
  draught ready?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is ready," replied the physician. "I brought the hemlock ready
  pounded, and Stilicho has mixed it."</p>

  <p>He clapped his hands, and a slave brought in the cup.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said the old man with a smile, as he took and drained it, "I am
  after all to have the crowning honour of a philosopher's life, and die as
  Socrates died."</p>

  <p>But even this was not to be. The poison, which would have sent a fatal
  chill through a frame warm with vigorous life, seemed powerless to affect one
  so cold and feeble.</p>

  <p>"How is this, my friend?" said Seneca after a while. "My time is more than
  past, and our good friend the Centurion will be wanting to finish the work
  himself. What say you?"</p>

  <p>"I half feared it," replied the physician. "There is no life in you for
  the poison to lay hold of."</p>

  <p>"What do you advise then?"</p>

  <p>"A hot bath might hasten matters," replied the man of science. The hot
  bath was tried, but the old man grew cheerful and even playful.</p>

  <p>"The feast is ended, and though some of the dishes have been tasteless and
  ill- cooked, it has not been ill-furnished on the whole. Now it is time for
  the libation. To Jupiter!&mdash;not the 'Preserver'; that he is for those
  only who seek to live,&mdash;let me rather say ' Liberator,' for he is indeed
  about to set me free." As he spoke he scooped up some of the water in the
  hollow of his hand, and threw it on the slaves that were in attendance. A few
  minutes later he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"There must be an end of this. Take me into the hot chamber. That will
  finish it. Is it not so, Statius?" he said, looking to the physician.</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," replied Statius; "but it will be a painful process."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the philosopher, "that is only to be expected. For what says
  Cicero? 'The departure of the soul from the body does not happen without
  pain.' "</p>

  <p>A few minutes afterwards he had ceased to live.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap25"
     name="chap25"></a>XXV. &mdash; THE FATE OF SUBRIUS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE physician, whose house was in the immediate
  neighbourhood, offered Subrius hospitality for the night. The Tribune,
  unwilling to compromise any one by his presence, declined it.</p>

  <p>"There are reasons," he said, "why I should not come under your roof;
  don't ask me what they are, for it is better that you should not know.
  Besides, it is necessary for me to get back to Rome as soon as may be."</p>

  <p>Subrius had given up all hope for himself. Resistance and escape were
  equally out of the question. Nor could he hope to do anything for his
  confederates. Most of them were already in the hands of the authorities; the
  others would be infallibly named by one or other of the informers. The only
  one whom he saw a chance of saving was Pudens. Pudens was unknown to most of
  the conspirators,&mdash;a simple soldier on leave who might, it was possible,
  be sheltered by his obscurity. The Tribune was inclined to reproach himself
  for having involved the young man, whose frank and engaging character had
  greatly attracted him, in an undertaking which he now saw had been doomed to
  failure from the first.</p>

  <p>It was just possible that the mischief might be undone. It still wanted
  some three or four hours of midnight. Whatever was to be done must be done
  before morning, for beyond that time the final blow could hardly be delayed.
  If Pudens could be found that night, he might possibly escape.</p>

  <p>The Tribune accordingly proceeded straight to the place where the young
  officer was still employed in the superintendence of public works before
  described. Late as it was when he arrived, Pudens was still busy. It was, in
  fact, the last day of his engagement, and he was busy completing his final
  report and making up his accounts, for he had latterly been intrusted with
  the payment of the workmen. He was not alone, for the Christian freedman,
  whom for some time he had employed as his assistant, was with him, and was
  helping him to wind up the affairs of his office. Curiously enough, no
  tidings of the exciting events which had been going on in Rome had reached
  him.</p>

  <p>As briefly as possible Subrius put his young friend in possession of the
  state of the case. "All is lost!" he said. "By whose fault this has come
  about it does not profit to inquire. For the present the fact is enough. All
  but a few of our friends are already in prison; the rest will soon be there.
  But there is a chance for you. You were a stranger to most of those who were
  concerned in the affair. Neither Scævinus nor Natalis, who are the principal
  informers, knew you by name. It is the greatest good luck that your
  engagement here has come to an end. As it is, your going away need excite no
  suspicion. My advice to you is this: Go to-morrow morning with your report
  and your accounts to your chief; but mind, don't go a moment before the usual
  time. Keep as cool as you can. If he says anything of what has happened, you,
  of course, will know nothing about it. Afterwards bid good by to any
  acquaintance that you may have. Mind, whatever you do, be leisurely and calm.
  Let there be nothing like hurry, for hurry is suspicious. After that I must
  leave everything to your own judgment and ingenuity. You have, I fancy from
  what you told me, a certain talent for disguising yourself. You will want it.
  Make your way, I should say, to the armies in the East. The particular spot
  that will be safest you must judge hereafter. The gods preserve you!"</p>

  <p>"And you!" cried the young man. "Will not you come with me?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, my friend," replied Subrius, "I should spoil it all, destroy your
  chance, and not profit myself."</p>

  <p>"But Pomponia and Claudia!" said Pudens, after a pause. "How can I leave
  them when I might be of some help?"</p>

  <p>"You can do nothing," answered Subrius. "If they are to be helped it
  cannot be by you. I don't even know where they are. Lateranus, as I told you,
  was arrested and executed. They were in his house. I did not hear of their
  being taken at the same time. Anyhow it will not profit them for you to
  thrust your head into the lion's mouth."</p>

  <p>At this point the freedman interrupted the conversation.</p>

  <p>"I think, sir," he said, "that I may be of some use, both to the noble
  ladies, if they are not already removed from Lateranus' house, and to my
  friend here, if I may be permitted so to speak of him. As for him, I do not
  think that it would be advisable for him to put the plan which you suggest
  into execution at once. That he should make his way some time to the army in
  the East, I agree; but, I should say, not now. Now, it is certain, all the
  roads, all the ports, are watched. A little time hence this vigilance will be
  relaxed; then the attempt can be made with more chance of success."</p>

  <p>"What then do you suggest?" asked Subrius.</p>

  <p>"We of the faith," answered the freedman, "have a hiding-place, where we
  keep our most precious things,&mdash;our books, our sacred vessels, and, in
  case of need, the persons of those whom we desire to conceal from the rage of
  our enemies. More I am not at liberty to say, for I am bound to secrecy; but
  there is a hope, I assure you, and I will certainly do my best to fulfil
  it."</p>

  <p>"What say you, Pudens?" said the Tribune, turning to the young man.</p>

  <p>It will readily be believed that Pudens did not hesitate for a moment. The
  idea of making his own escape, and leaving the two women to their fate, had
  been extremely distasteful to him. Though he had been compelled to confess to
  himself that he could give them little or no help, he still felt a desire,
  perhaps an unreasonable desire, to be near them, even, if it was so to be, to
  share their fate. He caught eagerly at the freedman's proposal.</p>

  <p>"I will stay," he said, "and take my chance here."</p>

  <p>"Then," cried Subrius, "if that is settled, I will go." He took an
  affectionate farewell of his friend, and departed.</p>

  <p>Some time had been occupied in the discussion, more than would be supposed
  from the brief summary that has here been given of it. It was now nearly
  dawn, and broad daylight before the camp was reached.</p>

  <p>Here, somewhat, perhaps, to his surprise, the Tribune found everything
  quiet. The sentinel at the gate saluted as usual. His soldier servant, who
  had been waiting for him, showed him all the customary respect, and roused
  him, after two or three hours of slumber, with the message that the Prefect
  wished to have his attendance at the Emperor's Court.</p>

  <p>He obeyed the summons, impressed with the profound conviction that that
  day was to see the end of the desperate game which the Prefect had been
  playing.</p>

  <p>The first intelligence that he received on reaching the Court was that
  Epicharis was beyond the reach of her enemies. While on her way to the Court,
  where she was to be again subjected to the torture, she had contrived to put
  an end to her life.</p>

  <p>"Thank the gods for that!" muttered the Tribune to himself. "She, at all
  events, is at peace. And now for our turn!"</p>

  <p>The turn came soon enough. The Prefect had been bearing himself all the
  morning, as prisoner after prisoner was being examined, with more than his
  usual confidence. At last Scævinus, who was again being questioned, when
  taunted with keeping back much of what he knew, turned upon his
  persecutor.</p>

  <p>"No one knows more of these things," he said with a meaning smile, "than
  yourself, Fænius Rufus. You are very jealous for your Emperor; don't you
  think that you can show your gratitude to him by making a confession of your
  own?"</p>

  <p>One would think that the man must have foreseen that, sooner or later, one
  of the accused would thus attack him. Yet he seemed as utterly unprepared for
  it as if such a contingency had never occurred to him. He might have flatly
  denied it; he might have passed over it with a pretence of silent contempt.
  He did neither. He hesitated, stammered, corrected and contradicted himself,
  in so manifest a condition of panic that his very appearance was equivalent
  to a confession.</p>

  <p>The example once set, Scævinus did not want for followers. Prisoner after
  prisoner stood up, and gave details so numerous, so minute, so consistent, as
  to put the fact of the Prefect's complicity beyond a doubt.</p>

  <p>"Seize him," cried Nero. "To think that this villain has been sitting
  unsuspected by my side for days!"</p>

  <p>A soldier, Cassius by name, a man of gigantic frame and vast strength,
  stepped forward, seized and bound him.</p>

  <p>"And then," cried one of the prisoners, "Cæsar, there is another
  conspirator among your guards. I charge Subrius Flavius, Tribune of the
  Prætorians, with treason."</p>

  <p>Nero started up in terror from his chair. His emotion was not mere terror.
  He knew the Tribune, knew him as a man of singular courage, and as he had
  always believed one who had always entertained a strong affection for
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Say, Subrius, I implore you," he cried, "say that this is not true. I
  cannot believe that you, too, are among the traitors."</p>

  <p>"Is it likely, Cæsar," replied the Tribune, "that I should league myself
  with cowards and traitors such as these?"</p>

  <p>The defence may have been serious; more probably it was ironical. Anyhow
  it was soon thrown aside. The witnesses heaped up evidence on evidence, and
  the Tribune, standing calmly and contemptuously silent, tacitly admitted its
  truth.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Subrius," said the Emperor, and there was even a touch of pathos
  in his voice, "tell me why you have forgotten your oath. You swore to be
  faithful to me. How is it, brave soldier as you are, that you have leagued
  yourself with traitors?"</p>

  <p>"Listen, Cæsar," cried the Tribune, "and hear the truth if for once only
  in your life. I conspired against you because I hated you. You had not a more
  faithful soldier while you deserved to be loved. But when you murdered your
  mother and your wife, when you became a charioteer, an actor, and an
  incendiary, then I began to hate you."</p>

  <p>These bold words struck the tyrant like a blow. He grew pale and shook
  with terror, and could not have been more utterly panic-stricken had the
  speaker been standing over him with a dagger.</p>

  <p>"Away with him!" he cried, when he had recovered his voice; and he was
  immediately pinioned and dragged away.</p>

  <p>His daring had at least one result that a brave man would have desired.
  Possibly he had calculated upon it. He was not kept in suspense about his
  fate. A fellow-tribune was ordered to lead him off to instant execution. A
  pit was dug in the field where he was to suffer. Subrius looked on with
  unmoved countenance while the work was being done. When the Centurion in
  charge saluted and reported it as finished Subrius looked at it with a
  critical eye.</p>

  <p>"Too narrow, too shallow!" he said. "You can't even dig a grave according
  to regulations."</p>

  <p>"Hold out your head, and don't flinch," said the Tribune, who had been
  charged to administer the fatal blow with his own hand.</p>

  <p>"Flinch you as little when you strike," said Subrius, eying with scorn his
  pale face and trembling hand.</p>

  <p>And indeed it needed a second blow before the head was severed from the
  body.</p>

  <p>"Ah, the villain felt that he was dying!" said Nero, when the Tribune
  reported and even made a boast of what had happened.</p>

  <p>It would be tedious to tell in detail the story of how Nero, his rage
  redoubled by his fear, pursued the conspirators with an unrelenting severity.
  Scarcely one escaped, and, strangely enough, some whom by some capricious
  indulgence he either acquitted or pardoned, put an end to their own lives,
  unable it would seem, to endure existence under such a master.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap26"
     name="chap26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; A PLACE OF REFUGE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE freedman Linus had lost no time in making his way to the
  mansion of Lateranus. He found everything there in a state of the wildest
  confusion. The wife and children of the dead man had fled for refuge to the
  house of a relative, taking with them nothing but what they could carry, and
  leaving everything else at the mercy of the slaves. These had thoroughly
  ransacked the house; they had broken into the cellars, where some of the
  plunderers lay at that moment in a state of hopeless intoxication. Others, of
  a more prudent type, had carried off whatever valuables they could lay their
  hands on. All the money and plate, in fact, every scrap of the precious
  metals that could be discovered, had disappeared. The chambers had been
  stripped of coverlets, curtains, and hangings. The handles of the doors had
  been removed, and even some of the best designs in the tessellated pavements
  had been pulled up. A more deplorable scene of ruin than that presented by
  the house when the freedman entered it could hardly be imagined.</p>

  <p>He found, however, to his great relief, that Pomponia and Claudia had not
  been molested. The soldiers sent to arrest Lateranus had received no mandate
  about the two women, and had accordingly left them alone. One faithful slave
  had remained, and had been doing his best to minister to their wants. For
  these, indeed, there still remained in the house a sufficient supply, though
  much had been wasted by the pillagers. But the outlook before the two women
  was gloomy in the extreme. They had no friend or kinsman to whom they could
  look for help. They could not even hope to remain long forgotten. At present
  the thoughts of all were engrossed by the examination and discovery of the
  conspirators. But it could hardly be long before Poppæa would bethink herself
  of her victims. All the Christian fortitude of Pomponia was wanted to keep up
  her own courage and to administer comfort to her young companion.</p>

  <p>It may be imagined then that the coming of the freedman was welcome in the
  extreme. He had not been able to reach the house in time to do anything that
  day. Even after nightfall, as long as the streets were full, it would not be
  safe to make a move. It was necessary for the party to wait with as much
  patience as they could exercise, till the quietest period of the twenty-four
  hours, the time between midnight and dawn.</p>

  <p>The place in which Linus hoped to find a refuge for his patroness and her
  young companion was a spot which was then known only to a few, but which has
  since attained a world-wide fame, the Catacombs of Rome. The greater part of
  the vast subterranean region now known by that name did not then exist. But a
  beginning of the excavations had been made. Already there were chambers which
  could be used for temporary dwellings, others in which worship could be
  celebrated, and others, again, in which the remains of the dead could find a
  final resting-place.</p>

  <p>The entrance to the excavations was by a sand-pit which had been long
  since disused. Happily for the secrecy which it was so essential to maintain,
  the place had an evil reputation. More than one murder had been committed
  there in former times, and every one, therefore, was careful to avoid it.</p>

  <p>Linus succeeded in removing the two ladies to their new shelter without
  attracting any attention. About thirty persons were already assembled there.
  The bishop or chief presbyter of Rome was not there; he had been called away,
  it happened, on Church business some time before, but one of his principal
  colleagues was acting in his stead, and had charge of the little community.
  He gave the newcomers a hearty welcome, and committed the two women to the
  special charge of a deaconess, who conducted them to the chamber which was
  assigned to them, and did her best with the very scanty means at her command
  to provide for their comfort.</p>

  <p>A few hours of rest were exceedingly grateful; but both insisted on
  attending the service which was held shortly after sunrise in a little
  chamber set apart for purposes of worship.</p>

  <p>It was the first day of the week, and the minister celebrated, according
  to custom, the rite of the Holy Eucharist. It was the first time that Claudia
  was admitted to partake of the Elements. It had been arranged some months
  before, immediately, in fact, after her arrival at Rome, that she should
  present herself at the Communion, but no opportunity had occurred for her to
  carry out her intention. The delay, though it had troubled her much, was not
  without its use. Her feelings had been deepened and strengthened in no common
  degree by all that she had gone through. As she knelt by the side of her
  adopted mother to receive the bread and wine from the hands of the minister,
  she felt raised to a spiritual height which it is seldom granted to human
  nature to attain.</p>

  <p>To one who watched the rite from without&mdash;for he was not privileged
  to enter the sacred precincts&mdash;Claudia seemed to wear a look of more
  than human sanctity. This observer was Pudens. He had carried out the
  instructions of Subrius to the letter, had parted with his chief on the
  friendliest terms, and, after concealing himself during the day, had managed,
  but not without meeting with one or two dangerous adventures, to reach the
  spot indicated by the freedman. Here the password, communicated to him by
  Linus, had secured his admission from the guardians of the entrance. He had
  arrived in time to witness the solemn scene just described, and to listen to
  the address, partly of thanksgiving, for the deliverance vouchsafed in the
  past, partly of exhortation to courage and faithfulness in the future, which
  the minister addressed to his little congregation at the close of the holy
  rite.</p>

  <p>The days which followed, were full, for the young man, of curiously
  mingled emotions.</p>

  <p>It was a delight to be near the woman whom he loved, and yet how remote
  she seemed from him! The follies of his youth, even the scheme in which he
  had been lately engaged, with its self-seeking and the pettiness of its
  motives and aims, as he now looked upon them, seemed to separate her
  hopelessly from him. The girl herself, on the few occasions which he had of
  seeing her, was friendly; she was more than friendly, she was profoundly
  grateful. But her looks, her demeanour, everything about her showed plainly
  enough that he was not in her thoughts in the way in which he wished to
  be.</p>

  <p>Happily for him this painful ordeal&mdash;for such he felt it to
  be&mdash;did not last very long. About a week after his arrival there came
  tidings from the upper world, if so it may be called, which materially
  altered the prospects of the refugees. The intelligence was brought by a
  slave from the palace, one of the sympathizers whose presence at headquarters
  was, as we have already seen, often useful to the Christian community.</p>

  <p>The main fact which the newcomer had to communicate to his friends was the
  death of Poppæa. Every one felt that the worst enemy of the Church was
  removed.</p>

  <p>"When did she die?" asked one of the Elders.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday," said the messenger.</p>

  <p>"And how?"</p>

  <p>"Cæsar struck her a violent blow with his foot. He had been driving his
  chariot, and came into the room where she was sitting, in his charioteer's
  dress. She was sick and suffering. Something, too, had happened to cross her
  temper. She taunted him. 'A pretty dress for Cæsar!' she said. 'I shall dress
  as I please,' he answered. 'At least you should do such things well,' she
  went on. That touched him to the quick, you may be sure. To be a charioteer
  does not trouble him, but to be a bad charioteer&mdash;that is intolerable.
  He fell into a furious rage, and kicked her. Three hours afterwards she died.
  The physicians could do nothing for her. I believe that she never spoke
  again. Indeed, she was not conscious. Cæsar, when his rage was over, was
  fairly mad with grief. He could not endure to be present at the Conclamatio,
  which was made last night."</p>

  <p>"Poor creature!" said one of the audience. "May God show her more mercy
  than she showed to others!"</p>

  <p>"She is to be embalmed and buried in the Mausoleum of Augustus, but there
  is to be a great burning all the same. Orders have been given for an image of
  the deceased to be made, and this to be burnt on the pyre. And Cæsar is to
  pronounce her funeral oration himself."</p>

  <p>"Will this affect us?" asked the Elder who had first spoken.</p>

  <p>"Greatly," replied the slave. "I have with me a copy of an edict which
  will be published in the course of a few days."</p>

  <p>The edict was produced and read.</p>

  <p><i>"Seeing that the people called Christians have already suffered
  sufficiently for their misdeeds, Cæsar decrees that they shall henceforth be
  permitted to live in peace, provided that they do not again offend against
  the safety of the Roman people."</i></p>

         title="The Conclamatio.">

    <p class="caption">The Conclamatio.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>As soon as the edict was posted up in the city&mdash;and this was done on
  the day of the funeral oration&mdash;the refugees returned to their homes.
  Pudens took the same opportunity of making his escape from Rome.</p>

  <p>His original intention was, as has been said, to return to the army of
  Corbulo; but this plan, fortunately for him, was not carried out.</p>

  <p>The causes that prevented it, however, very nearly cost him his life. He
  arrived at Antioch, on his way eastward, just at the beginning of the summer
  heats. Malarial fever, following the subsidence of the spring floods, was
  rife in the city, and Pudens, predisposed to infection by the fatigue of a
  very rapid journey, as well as by anxiety and distress, was soon prostrated
  by it. Happily a travelling companion, whom he had joined at Corinth, and who
  had found out that they possessed many mutual acquaintances, had hospitably
  invited him to take up his quarters at his house. Pudens, who could hardly
  have survived the neglect that would probably have been his lot at the public
  inn, was carefully nursed. Even then he had a hard fight for his life, and
  summer was passing into early autumn before he could be said to be on a fair
  way to recovery.</p>

  <p>One day, about the middle of September, he was taking a walk in the
  garden, when he was joined by his host, a Roman knight, it may be said in
  passing, who managed some extensive affairs connected with the public revenue
  of the province of Syria.</p>

  <p>"I must be thinking of going on," said Pudens, after the usual inquiries
  about health had been duly answered.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about," returned his host.
  "Of course you know that the longer you stay with me as my guest the better
  pleased I shall be. But you have your own plans, and naturally want to carry
  them on. Now let me be frank, and tell you exactly what I know, and what I
  think you ought to do. It would not surprise you to hear that you have been
  delirious?"</p>

  <p>Pudens nodded assent. There were blank spaces in his memory, and other
  spaces all but blank, but haunted with a dim sense of disturbance and
  trouble. Without any remembrance of actual pain he could easily believe that
  he had been in the condition which his host described.</p>

  <p>"No, indeed," said our hero. "It is no surprise to me; I must have given
  you a world of trouble."</p>

  <p>"Not a word of that; but hark!" and the speaker dropped his voice to a
  whisper, "you said things which made me take care that no one should watch
  you but myself and my wife."</p>

  <p>Pudens could not help starting.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" went on the other, "high matters of State which would touch a man's
  life. Now I do not ask for your confidence, but if there is anything in which
  I can help you, I am at your service."</p>

  <p>Pudens saw at once that absolute frankness was his best policy, and
  related the story of the conspiracy.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I supposed," returned his host, "and you thought of
  taking up again your service with Corbulo."</p>

  <p>"That was my idea," said Pudens.</p>

  <p>"And not a bad idea either, in some cases. There are camps where you would
  be safe, even though you were known to have had a hand in the conspiracy,
  supposing, I mean of course, the general-in-command wished it to be so. You
  would be safe with Verginius on the Rhine, or with Galba in Spain. They are
  too big men for the Emperor to disturb, and if they don't choose to give a
  fugitive up, he has to be content. Corbulo is big enough in one way, but he
  has no idea of disputing the Emperor's will. It is more than fidelity with
  him. It is subservience, except that he does not think of getting anything by
  it. If Nero sends a Centurion for Corbulo's head, he will put out his neck,
  mark my words, without a murmur. And they are after you; that I know. While
  you were lying insensible, a Centurion passed through here with a warrant for
  the arrest of a conspirator, whose name I happened to hear,&mdash;indeed, I
  was applied to for my help,&mdash;and the name was Caius Pudens. No! you must
  not go back to Corbulo; it would be putting your head into the lion's
  mouth."</p>

  <p>"It is a disappointment," said Pudens. "I had counted upon Corbulo. But
  what do you suggest?"</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I have been thinking of. It would be a risk to go
  westward again; though once in Spain or Germany you might be safe. No; I
  should advise you to stay here, or hereabouts. I have an idea," he resumed,
  after a few minutes' silence. "You must tell me what you think about it.
  Briefly, it is this; enlist under another name in the local force which our
  King here keeps up. It is a somewhat audacious plan, but none the worse for
  that. You can wear the beard which you have grown during your three months'
  illness. It is not uncommon in the force. That will be something of a
  disguise."</p>

  <p>The suggestion was carried out, and with success. No one thought of
  looking for a conspirator in hiding among the troops of King Antiochus, and
  so no one found him. The events of the years that followed may be told in a
  few words. Two years after his enlistment Pudens heard of the fate of
  Corbulo, a fate which singularly justified his friend's conception of his
  character. Not long after he had the relief of hearing that Nero was dead. In
  the year of civil strife that followed this event, the year which saw three
  Emperors fall in rapid succession, he was, happily for himself, better
  employed than in supporting one pretender or another. Vespasian, appointed to
  command the legions of Syria in the year of Corbulo's death, had a keen eye
  for a good soldier; he saw the capacity of Pudens, and offered him a place on
  his personal staff, during the earlier operations of the Jewish war.
  Vespasian, going to Rome in the autumn of 69 to take possession of the
  Imperial throne, handed over his aide-de-camp to Titus. A brilliant period of
  service followed. The most famous siege in history, the siege of Jerusalem,
  was going on, and Pudens had a share in all its perils and glories.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap27"
     name="chap27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; MEETING AGAIN</h2>

  <p class="first">JERUSALEM fell on September 2nd. About six weeks after,
  Pudens was once more in Rome, the bearer of a despatch from Titus to his
  father, the Emperor, announcing his success, and giving the details of the
  final assault and of the events which followed it.</p>

  <p>He had reached Rome late at night, too late to present himself at the
  palace. He snatched a few hours of sleep at an inn which was conveniently
  near, and proceeded to discharge his duty at the earliest possible hour next
  morning. The day had scarcely dawned, but the Emperor's ante-chamber was
  already open, and already contained two or three occupants. Vespasian was a
  very early riser, and Pudens, who announced himself to the usher in waiting
  as the bearer of despatches from the army of the East, was not kept waiting
  more than two or three minutes. Admitted to the Imperial presence, he met
  with a very warm greeting from his old chief; the despatches were read, and
  the information they contained had, of course, to be supplemented by a number
  of details which Pudens was able to supply. The interview was naturally
  protracted to a very great length, and when Pudens was at last dismissed, not
  without a hearty assurance of future favour from the Emperor, he found the
  ante-chamber crowded with applicants who had been vainly waiting for an
  audience. Their hopes were summarily dashed, at least for the day, by an
  announcement from the usher that the Emperor was too much occupied by a
  sudden pressure of business to see any other visitor that morning.</p>

  <p>A groan of disappointment went up from the little crowd.</p>

  <p>"You have done us all an ill turn, sir," said a young man with a
  remarkably clever face and brilliant eyes, shabbily dressed, but evidently a
  gentleman. "But doubtless your business with the Emperor was much more
  important than all of ours put together. You are a soldier, I see, and if I
  guess rightly, from the East. Is your news a secret, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," answered Pudens. "All Rome may, and probably will, know it
  in the course of a few hours. Briefly, Jerusalem is taken."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said the other, "there have been rumours of the kind about for the
  last two or three days. And so it has actually happened. No wonder that the
  Emperor could think of nothing else."</p>

  <p>"I hope, sir," said our hero, "that the business which I unwittingly
  interrupted or postponed was not very pressing?"</p>

  <p>His new acquaintance, whom I may introduce to my readers by his full name
  of M. Valerius Martialis, smiled. "Certainly not, it was a trifle. I have a
  little poem in my pocket, which I should be glad if you would do me the
  favour of hearing at your leisure, and I wanted to get an order for some more
  of the same kind from the Emperor. To tell you the truth, he does not care
  much for poets and their verses, and his ideas of remuneration are of the
  most moderate kind. A very frugal person, sir, is Cæsar. Perhaps it is as
  well, for another Nero would certainly have made the Empire hopelessly
  bankrupt; but still there's a limit, and when it comes to paying ten
  sesterces a line for really tolerable verses,&mdash;if I may say so much of
  my own work,&mdash;one may say that the virtue is a little in excess."</p>

  <p>"I hope," remarked Pudens, "that private patrons are more liberal, and
  that there are those who buy."</p>

  <p>"As for private patrons," returned the poet, "there are good and bad, and
  as I said of my own epigrams, a few good and more bad. As for the public that
  buy, very little of their money comes to us. The publishers send us in large
  bills, and what with copying, price of parchment, ink, vermilion,
  pumice-stone, polishing, and I know not what else, there is very little left.
  And then, if a book does sell, there are rascals who copy it, and give us
  nothing at all. But I am running on, and tiring you with things that don't
  interest you. Will you dine with me to-day? Mind, there will be simple poet's
  fare&mdash;a few oysters, a roast kid, and a jar of Alban wine. If you want
  flowers or perfume or Falernian, you must even bring them yourself."</p>

  <p>Pudens, who had very few friends in Rome, gladly accepted.</p>

  <p>"Remember, then," said the poet, "at the eleventh hour. I have some work
  to do, and I cannot afford to be fashionable and early."</p>

  <p>"You must see the great beauty about whom all the golden youth of Rome is
  raving," said Martial, in the course of their after-dinner talk. "That is to
  say, if you can contrive it, for it is no easy matter to catch a glimpse of
  her. She is never at the theatre or the Circus. Her mother&mdash;mother by
  adoption, you will understand&mdash;is a very strange person, follows some
  curious superstition, I am told, the chief part of which, it seems, is to
  take all the pleasure out of life. But the girl is a great beauty, not in our
  Roman style at all, but dazzlingly fair, a British princess they say she is,
  whatever that may mean."</p>

  <p>Pudens, of course, recognized Claudia in this description. He did not care
  to betray his acquaintance with her, nor indeed to encourage his host in
  talking about her. Martial's way of speaking about women, was, to be candid,
  not very edifying, and though he had nothing but good to say about this
  northern beauty, Pudens did not care to hear her name upon his lips.</p>

  <p>The years which the young soldier had spent between his departure from the
  capital and his return to it had been a time in which he had learnt and
  thought much. In particular, the knowledge of Christianity which he had begun
  to acquire under the instruction of Linus had been greatly deepened and
  broadened. The new faith had been commended to him by the purity, the
  courage, the self- devotion of its professors. He now began to realize what a
  power it already was, to what vast proportions it was likely to grow. In the
  East, while he was living in Antioch, and afterwards, while he was in camp
  before the walls of Jerusalem, he had many opportunities of hearing the
  marvellous history of its origin and its growth. Scarcely a single generation
  had passed since it had been founded by an obscure Galilean peasant, and
  already there was not a city or town, scarcely a village, in which it did not
  possess a company, often a very numerous company, of devoted followers. The
  young man had never heard or read of anything like it. That, he felt, could
  be no mere superstition, which, without any attraction of pomp or power,
  offering to its followers nothing but a life of self-denial, made burdensome
  by the hatred and contempt of society, had yet found disciples wherever it
  had come. Here was something which, before long, would match, and more than
  match, the world-wide influence of the great Roman Empire itself. The
  impression thus made had been deepened by his intercourse with men, of whom
  he met not a few both at Antioch and in Judæa, who had had personal knowledge
  both of the Founder and of his first followers. The story which they had to
  tell of wonders which they had witnessed, and of which, in some cases, they
  had been themselves the subjects, interested him profoundly. He was even more
  touched by the picture they drew of a sanctity, a purity, a burning zeal for
  the good of mankind, which was more marvellous than the healing of the sick,
  the restoring of sight to the blind, even the bringing back of the dead to
  life.</p>

  <p>And with this influence in the young man's life there had always mingled
  his recollection of Claudia. She embodied to him the noblest ideal of
  womanhood, an ideal, too, inseparably linked with the faith of which he had
  been learning so much. For these years he had heard nothing of her, and of
  course did not escape the fancies and fears with which lovers are wont to
  torment themselves. She might be dead, or, a thought even yet harder to
  endure, she might be lost to him.</p>

  <p>It was therefore with no common emotion that he had now heard from his new
  acquaintance that she was in Rome, that she was well, that, possibly, she was
  still free.</p>

  <p>As early as possible the next morning he presented himself at Pomponia's
  house. His reception was all that he could have desired. The elder lady had a
  grateful recollection of his kindness and zeal, and Claudia had no more
  forgotten him than he had forgotten her. The two women listened with an
  untiring interest to the story of adventure which the young soldier had to
  tell. When the great siege in which he had been taking part came to be
  discussed, the conversation inevitably turned on the subject of Christianity.
  Pudens was led on to speak of the thoughts which had been occupying his mind,
  and Pomponia particularly inquired whether he had made a regular profession
  of the faith which had so greatly impressed him. Pudens answered that he had
  not. Circumstances had hindered him from submitting himself to a regular
  course of instruction, but his mind had been made up; he had only been
  waiting for an opportunity of giving expression to convictions which he had
  long since formed.</p>

  <p>"You will come with us to-morrow," said Pomponia to her visitor, when,
  after some hours of conversation, he rose to take his leave. "We have a duty
  to perform which it will interest you, I am sure, to witness, if you cannot
  actually take a part in it. We leave the house early, before daybreak,
  indeed, if that is not too soon for you."</p>

  <p>Pudens did not fail to present himself at the appointed hour. A carriage
  was waiting at the gate of Pomponia's mansion, and the ladies were already
  seated in it. He joined them, and became so engrossed in the conversation
  that followed that he did not notice the direction in which they proceeded.
  It was with no little surprise and emotion that when the carriage stopped he
  found himself at the entrance to the Catacombs.</p>

  <p>"We commemorate to-day," said Pomponia, "those who had the privilege five
  years ago of witnessing their faith and love by their deaths. You will watch
  the rite from without; another year, I hope, you will be one of us."</p>

  <p>Thus did Pudens, standing with the catechumens, of whom he was reckoned to
  be virtually one, witness again the solemn act of worship on which he had
  looked, under very different circumstances, five years before. This ended,
  came the commemoration itself. The presiding Elder read the list of saints
  and martyrs who had sealed their testimony with their blood. Foremost on the
  list came the two Apostles, Peter and Paul, who had suffered two years
  before, the first the death of a slave, the second by the headsman's axe on
  the Ostian Road. Then followed a list of names, unknown and yet known, long
  since forgotten upon earth, but remembered by Him Who is faithful to keep all
  that is committed unto Him.</p>

  <p>There is little more for me to tell. Pudens lost no time in putting
  himself under instruction. The Elder who undertook to examine and teach him
  found him so well prepared that there was no need to delay the rite. Pudens
  was received into the Church at the festival of Christmas, and a week
  afterwards became the husband of Claudia.</p>

  <p>Many old friends were gathered at the wedding, among them Phlegon, still
  vigorous in spite of his fourscore years, and Linus, who, as Pudens did not
  fail to remember, had been the first to show him what Christian belief and
  practice really were. Nor did he forget his debt to another, without whose
  courage and devotion he had scarcely lived to see that happiest hour of his
  life, the Tribune Subrius. As he knelt with his bride in silent prayer after
  receiving the minister's final blessing, he put up a fervent supplication
  that some rays of the light which had fallen upon him might reach, he knew
  not where or how, the brave, true-hearted man to whom he owed life and
  happiness.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Marriage of Claudia and Pudens.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>A few days after their marriage the young couple held a reception of their
  friends and acquaintances. Among them was the poet Martial, who brought with
  him not the least acceptable of the wedding gifts which they had received, an
  epigram written in praise of the bride. It ran thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">"Our Claudia see, true Roman, though she springs<br>
  From a long line of Britain's painted kings;<br>
  Italia's self might claim so fair a face,<br>
  And Athens envy her her matchless grace."</p>

  <p>The author, though he spoke of his offering as a gift, was not displeased
  when the bridegroom pressed into his hand a roll of ten gold pieces. He
  whispered to a friend, "There is a real lover of the Muses! He would have
  made an admirable Emperor, at least from my point of view; but he is
  certainly happier as he is."</p>
