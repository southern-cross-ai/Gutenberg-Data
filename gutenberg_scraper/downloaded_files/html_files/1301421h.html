<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> age of hero worship is rapidly passing away
in the murky cloud of barbarous feudalism, and that of the
champions of moral virtue benignantly dawning over the surface of
the civilized world. The truly noble who give knowledge, dignity,
peace, and love, to mankind, are becoming the recognized heroes
of all people. The sun of truth is emerging into mental light a
glorious phalanx, too long hidden by false teaching and
interested policy; while justice ordains them, those positions in
national honour, which have been, for ages past, hideously
usurped. The mission of "nature's nobles" comprises the
alleviation of the miseries attendant upon the human family, the
teaching man his duty to man, the exalting him to self-respect,
the instilling humanity, and thus creating that most illustrious
of characters&mdash;a practical Christian:</p>
<p class="poem">"The drying up one tear has more<br>
Of honest fame, than shedding seas of gore."</p>
<p>Firmly impressed with the conviction, that among the
benefactors of the human race, the subject of the following pages
will occupy the attention of future biographers, while the
interesting documents relative to the distinguishing features of
her career can readily be collected, and inaccuracies corrected
by living witnesses, we have taken upon ourselves the pleasing
duty of arranging them in chronological order; tracing the flow
of active benevolence from its source until widened into a broad
and useful purpose. We have attended more to positive public
facts than to minute personal illustrations, as during the
lifetime of an individual, more especially a lady, there is ever
a feeling of delicacy against gratifying a mere morbid taste by
rudely peering behind the veil of domestic life. The recounting
the public acts of this amiable female allows of no scope for
cutting sarcasms and anatomizing by the pen&mdash;we believe all
her works "works of mercy", justly worthy of praise&mdash;and
praise we therefore have accorded in the sincerity of our
convictions&mdash;we have, in our investigations of the facts
placed before the public, seen no seeking, in the spirit of
vanity, for public applause, but a high-minded principle
pervading every act&mdash;a self-denying zeal daily in
operation&mdash;a practical wisdom ever exercised&mdash;a gentle
womanly sympathy continually applied&mdash;a kind of intuitive
knowledge of the secret workings of the human breast, added to a
woman's keen penetration, by which the feelings of others were
divined, and led into a channel either for personal or public
benefit.</p>
<p>The woes and pains of those in affliction were soothed with a
nobleness of mind, a disinterestedness of purpose, and a sublimity
of virtue, that acts powerfully on our sympathies. We record them
that they may be admired and imitated. Philanthropist! a word mighty
in signifhcance, encircles with humanizing radiance the name of
Caroline Chisholm.</p>
<p>Emigration is the seed from whence germinates a future nation.
Its mode, its source, and other facts, are the first entries on a
country's historic page, which succeeding generations pore over
with intense interest. In its records are traced the blood and
kindred that gives character to a people, and show from whence
sprang their ideas of politic, social and moral laws, deeply
imbuing the community at its sun-rise, and permeating its destinies
in its zenith.</p>
<p>On emigration, Mrs. Chisholm has produced, by indomitable perseverance,
a deep impression, the results of which will long be acknowledged, as
it has given life, energy, and moral character to
an important and rising colony. She found the
stream polluted, and she has purified it. The
weak she has protected, and the poor she has
sheltered tenderly and affectionately. With a
woman's courage and resolution she has asserted the
dignity of her sex, and caused the unscrupulous
voluptuary to shrink appalled, and respect nature's
loveliest creation, although in want and in rags.
The chances, perils, and difficulties of a new far
off home she has reduced; the outset rendered
more independent, the voyage one of health,
industry and protection, the reception kind and
secure, and the future prospects of life one of
earthly happiness.</p>
<p>To add to the charms and delights of the tenderest
chords that vibrate in the human bosom,
to prevent them being bruised or torn asunder,
has been a task performed with apostolic fervour
and enthusiasm&mdash;a labour of love worthy of a heroic
woman and the gratitude of her fellow beings.</p>
<p>So potent is truth, that a powerful government has made
concession to its representations and the demands of
humanity.</p>
<p>In this place it is but justice to state that we are indebted
to Samuel Sidney, Esq., for many facts which he generously placed
at our disposal. This gentleman has made the subject of
colonization peculiarly his study, and with ardour and talent,
successfully advocated a liberal policy, conducive to the present
and future benefit of emigrants, and honourable to the parent
country.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we would remark, our biographical duties have
been easy, as we have had no hidden motive in the individual to
probe to its source, no ambitious aim to follow in a tortuous
path, and the good and evil results of actions we have not had to
weigh and call in the aid of philosophy to decide. When the time
and the able pen come to trace the growth and developement of the
mind that has actuated to the achievement of the facts related in
this work, we hope our collection and arrangement may prove
serviceable to such a literary contribution.</p>
<p>Whenever the opportunity presented itself, we have freely
availed ourselves of Mrs Chisholm's public statements, and any
official document in relation to her. We were first urged to our
present undertaking for the pages of a serial publication, and it
has been printed at a distance from our residence, these facts we
hope will excuse any slight errors in style, arrangement, or
typography that may have escaped our notice in passing through
the press.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p align="center"><b>FATHER OF MRS. CHISHOLM&mdash;EARLY
IMPRESSIONS&mdash;OLD SOLDIER&mdash;INFANTILE
COLONIZATION&mdash;LOSS OF FATHER&mdash;COUNTRY
LIFE&mdash;MARRIAGE.</b></p>
<br>
<p>England at one time abounded with a class among its people
called yeomen, of which the country was justly proud. In a
circuit around their homes they were looked upon as the presiding
and fostering chiefs, their doors were open to the inquiring or
weary wayfarer, hospitality was their distinguishing
characteristic, and the needy, the struggling or the unfortunate
sought their sympathy, advice, or assistance&mdash;seldom,
indeed, fruitlessly. Money did not form the absorbing object of
their pursuit, but to live honoured and respected by their
neighbours was the happiness at which they aimed. To this sturdy
class of Englishmen belonged Mrs. Chisholm's father, Mr. William
Jones, a native of Wootton, Northamptonshire. Proud of his
country and its institutions he contributed handsomely to the
"Voluntary fund" that was subscribed during the existing
war,&mdash;while his superior understanding and probity caused
his advice to be sought by those who found pleasure in the
exciting turmoil of political affairs.</p>
<p>A natural unbending love of truth gave to him a pride of
demeanour, and also abhorrence of secrecy that was carried into
the minutest details in the government of his family; thus
however young a child might be it was allowed to remain in the
apartment while important matters of business were discussed, or
subjects of grave political importance canvassed. On the
susceptible mind of youth this must have produced a deep
impression, more especially as, when the child was seen to be
attentive, its opinion was asked.</p>
<p>One day this high minded man introduced to his house a poor
maimed soldier whom he attended with respect and affection, and
calling his children pointed out what obligations they were under
to this veteran; he having fought the enemies of England amid the
perils of sea and land, and sacrificed his limbs, that they might
live in ease, comfort and security at home. This old soldier
excited the curiosity of the children by descriptions of other
countries, the beauty of the scenery, the excellence of climate,
the abundance of food, the advantages that would accrue by the
possession of those paradises as colonies, and the fortunes
emigrants might reap. This event, and family correspondence with
some American settlers set the busy mind of the infant Caroline,
the heroine of these pages, to ponder over the subject, and its
effects are thus recollected and described in a letter to a
friend in Sidney.</p>
<p>"My first attempt at <i>colonization</i> was carried on in a
wash-hand basin, before I was seven years old. I made boats of
broad beans; expended all my money in touchwood dolls; removed
families, located them in the bed-quilt, and sent the boats,
filled with wheat, back to their friends, of which I kept a store
in a thimble case. At length I upset the basin, which I judged to
be a fac simile of the sea, spoiled a new bed, got punished, and
afterwards carried out my plan in a dark cellar, with a rushlight
stuck upon a tin kettle; and, strange as it may seem, many of the
ideas which I have since carried out first gained possession of
my mind at that period; and, singular as it may appear, I had a
Wesleyan minister and a Catholic priest in the same boat. Two of
my dolls were very refractory, and would not be obedient; this
made me name them after two persons I knew who were always
quarrelling, and I spent hours in listening to their supposed
debates, to try and find out how I could manage them: at length I
put the two into a boat, and told them if they were not careful
they would be drowned; and having landed them <i>alive</i>, I
knelt down to pray to God to make them love each other."</p>
<p>An early loss of her father caused the education of the mind
of the youthful Caroline to devolve upon her mother, who was left
in easy circumstances, and fortunately being a woman possessed of
surprising resolution, acute perceptions, abundant humanity and a
firm reliance on the love of God, the lessons taught ripened
those extraordinary mental powers of her daughter so admirably
befitting to the great works of her future destiny.</p>
<p>The life of a young country girl presents but few points of
interest. The sphere is prescribed within a narrow compass, still
an isolated active mind will in some manner develope its vital
powers, and we find that the practical benevolence of visiting
the poor and the sick, of advising and soothing the distressed,
shed a lustre around the girlish days of this noble woman.</p>
<p>When about twenty years of age the subject of these memoirs
married Alexander Chisholm, an officer of the British army. There
existed in the young couple a sympathy of disposition most
remarkable, and thus the husband has ever most ardently
reciprocated all the philanthropic aspirations of his wife.</p>

COMMITTEES&mdash;ECONOMY&mdash;BENEVOLENCE&mdash;NOBLE
SUBSCRIPTIONS&mdash;ORPHANAGE&mdash;RULES&mdash;ADDRESS&mdash;INTERNAL

<br>
<p>Captain A. Chisholm, of the Madras army, arid his wife, about
two years after their marriage, sailed for India, and it was here
that first were begun those practical public works that have so
eloquently appealed to the feelings, and done honour to the heart
and understanding of Mrs. Chisholm.</p>
<p>The language and scenes of a barrack room are decidedly
unsuitable to the ears and eyes of female youth. Familiarity with
licentious and profane expressions, and indecorous conduct must
obliterate all delicacy of mind and action. Moral torpitude
ensues and vice loses its horrors. What other result would be
expected but that which did occur to the poor creatures? In
budding womanhood the playthings of passion, in their youth
loathsome and abandoned, and in their prime the tenants of a
premature tomb. Their lives disgraced humanity, the object of
existence by them was unfulfilled, and they perished lost to the
merits and rewards of their sacrificed Redeemer.</p>
<p>The fashionable excitement of life allowed few of their own
sex, placed in happier circumstances, even to cast a thought upon
these sacrifices to man's selfishness. Ladies shrank from
entertaining such a subject in their minds, and if they did they
feared the derision and scorn that would be levelled at their
sympathy. God in his wisdom has given superiority of moral
courage to some minds, an enduring love of their species, and
firm reliance in Christian truth. Mrs. Chisholm indignant at the
degradation of her sex resolved to effect a reform, but with a
discrimination, unoffensiveness and completeness peculiar to
herself. Determined to commence at the root, that no further
growth should take place, she proposed to form a girl's school of
the children and orphans of the soldiers, in which education
should be blended with the duties of housekeeping. The room
accorded for this purpose was in the precincts of the barracks,
which Mrs. Chisholm soon discovered would prevent, from its
immediate contaminations, her ulterior views. The neighbourhood
was dense and unhealthy, notwithstanding which, as the humane
founder of the project was acting from the purest motives,
seeking no vain-glorious applause, but devoted to carrying out in
sincerity the objects undertaken, and stating that as she had
taken upon herself the sacred duties of a mother to the girls she
must personally watch over and direct their actions; therefore,
this noble lady, with her worthy husband, removed from their
comfortable habitation to a district where, from dread of
infection, many families of their acquaintance refused to visit
them. The utility of the establishment becoming apparent it was
shortly afterwards removed to a distance where really commenced
"The School of Industry". The matron selected was an excellent
housewife, and considered more suitable from not being able to
read or write, as the responsibility of the reports consequently
entirely devolved on the pupils. A committee was formed of the
little girls, who deliberated and arranged the duties to be
performed. Arithmetic and writing were learnt by keeping a strict
account of the expenses and consumption of every article. The
receipts and disbursements of all food, utensils, clothing,
firing, wages, the duties performed, and incidental occurrences
were all minutely recorded. The stores were given in charge to
another set, some enacting the part of vendors weighing out and
setting down the price per lb. and gross amount of all the items.
Thus there was practical shopping and shopkeeping. The tiny
members of the committee consulted on the kind and quantity of
food for each day's requirement; the loss sustained by boiling,
baking and roasting; all articles being carefully estimated: a
girl by this mode of procedure knew what amount of provisions
would be required in a family of three or thirteen, giving
reasons for such calculations, and also the cost, hence the
income necessary under such circumstances. They superintended and
assisted in every domestic duty and thus resulted practical
housekeeping.</p>
<p>When sickness afflicted any of them the causes, symptoms and
cure were regularly registered, befitting the pupils for the
duties of the sick room.</p>
<p>When food was left from the meals it formed a subject for
consideration whether too much had been cooked or it had not been
relished. A test of a few days corrected the error, if one: then
the little conclave debated how the food could be most
satisfactorily used on the morrow or the same day&mdash;here was
a lesson on economy&mdash;or in what manner it could be nicely
dressed up to give to some poor or sick person&mdash;thus the
divine attribute of charity was indelibly implanted on the fair
mind of susceptible childhood.</p>
<p>Eagerly were those valuable housekeepers sought for as
servants and as wives of non commissioned officers. While many
youthful but deficient helpmates of the soldiery beseeched to be
admitted that they might participate in the advantages of such
instruction.</p>
<p>Proud are we to record, and honourable is it to the Madras
presidency and officers of our brave Indian army, that the then
secretary, Mr. Chamier, took a lively interest in forwarding this
valuable school; Sir Frederick Adams, the governor, subscribed
&pound;20. and in five days 2000 rupees were raised by a few
officers and gentlemen in order to render effective the plan of
Mrs. Chisholm. This institution was the commencement of what is
now an extensive orphanage, rearing in industry, and protecting
in virtue, those who have lost the guardianship of parents who
have fallen a sacrifice to the glory of their country.</p>
<p>Considering the rules, the moral lessons, and the details of
the system by which "The School of Industry" was governed, not
only in the light of a curious document, but as a valuable model
for carrying out similar institutions in an economical manner, we
are pleased to have it in our power to give insertion to an
authentic copy of the regulations. Be it remembered that a useful
and virtuous direction of the mind of female youth tells
powerfully afterwards on society, for the true education of
future generations is ever centered in the maternal parent.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><small>THE</small> chief object of this Institution is to
enable such European Soldiers as may feel disposed to remove
their children from the Barracks and Putchery Lines. A House for
their reception is to be procured in Black Town, Madras, where
the children will be instructed in reading, writing, arithmetic,
needle-work, and domestic management. Their religious instruction
and moral conduct will be made an object of particular
attention.</p>
<hr class="2">
<p align="center">RULES.</p>
<p>I.&mdash;Each child is to come provided with two plates, one
cup and saucer, one knife and fork, one table and tea spoon, one
drinking mug, and one common box for clothes.</p>
<p>II.&mdash;Each child is to be furnished with a separate bed,
they are to be clothed in one uniform dress (after they have worn
out such clothes as they may have brought with them to school)
and to have one general mess.</p>
<p>III.&mdash;They are to get up at an hour so as to be able to
take some recreation in the cool of the morning, either on the
Beach or Esplanade, they are first however (after having washed
themselves) to say a short prayer, and after they have come in to
say their regular morning prayers, and then to have their
breakfast. The children are to be assembled for prayers and meals
by the ringing of a bell. They are never to go out without being
accompanied by either the mistress or matron of the school.</p>
<p>IV.&mdash;No child is to be sent or allowed to go to the
Bazaar. No male visitor is to be permitted into the school

<hr class="2">
<p align="center">ADDRESS TO BE READ BY THE MISTRESS.</p>
<hr class="2">
<p>My dear little Girls,</p>
<p>It is my wish that you should have read to you once a month
the list of punishments. The rod in appearance is quite frightful
and I think you will have the same opinion of it, and I trust you
will look upon the Bracelets with a determination never to wear
them. It is, I assure you, much easier to be good than to be bad,
and you must be the one or the other. It will be a very shocking
thing and would distress your parents and friends to see your
name in the <i>Black Book</i>. If you tell lies, I fear you will
soon learn to steal, for one generally follows the other; and if
you steal sugar and little things, I fear you will in time steal
broaches, and I dread to think what your end may be. But I hope
better things of you, and fully expect you will pay great
attention to the good instructions you receive, and be really
good girls. But if you are idle you cannot be good. I therefore
hope you will be industrious, this will be setting a good example
to the natives, for let me tell you, and I speak the truth, that
there is no situation in life in which you cannot do some good. I
wish you never to forget how kind your parents are to place you
in a situation where you are not surrounded by vice and
wickedness. They are now giving up some of their comforts to add
to yours, and it is not enough that you love them and feel
grateful, but you must show your gratitude by your good conduct,
and learn to be useful now, that you may here after be of real
use to them, and perhaps in their old age; think if your mother
should be ill, how happy it would make you to be able to nurse
her and make her nice jellies, and light puddings, and do all
that was required for her. You cannot, my children, think how
dearly a mother loves, and the comfort she would feel in having a
daughter for a nurse, and you must learn to do those things
before you can have this pleasure, and you have now the
opportunity. Think too how rejoiced your father would be to see
you do all this, and how much such conduct would repay him for
having given up his Arrack allowance to make you a good and
dutiful girl. I wish you also to consider how proud your parents
will be of you, I fancy I already hear your father say, in honest
pride, that my girl can keep accounts, cook a dinner, and she is
only fourteen years of age; and your mother says, yes, and make a
shirt and cut it out as well if not better than I can. That you
will be able to do these things I fully expect, and I have no
doubt but you will have a great pleasure in doing so, and your
being able to do them will give you a proper feeling of pride and
independence, that is, if your parents should die, you would be
able by your good conduct and management to support yourselves
and little brothers and sisters, for God will never forsake the
good. Before I conclude this, I must again refer to that
frightful Rod, that shocking Black Book, and those ugly
Bracelets, and as I think you will, with pride becoming soldier's
daughters, consider it a disgrace that they should be seen. I
will promise you, that if at the end of one year the Rod has
never been used, that you shall have a day's holiday to bury or
burn it, and that you shall invite your parents to be present on
the occasion, giving them cake &amp;c., made by your own hands.
When the Rod is fairly out of the house, the Rewards will be
distributed, and the ladies and gentlemen who have so kindly
supported this institution shall be invited to attend at the
distribution of the prizes, and you will know how necessary it is
that the Rod should be removed ere this could take place. Your
united good conduct could also remove the Bracelets and Black
Book. Try then, my dear little girls, to be good, never tell
lies, never steal the smallest thing, never fight and quarrel,
and never make use of bad words, and obey and do what you are
told, and you will then be the pride of your parents, a credit to
your religion, and the admiration of all your friends.</p>
<hr class="2">
<p align="center">TO THE MATRON AND MISTRESS.</p>
<p>You must never forget that children are early lovers of
justice, and that peace and harmony cannot dwell where
favouritism reigns. In this establishment, much will depend upon
your conduct, as children learn more from example than precept.
They are generally close and faithful imitators of those they
reside with, and will judge by your acts and not by your
professions; they will in the twinkling of an eye discover
whether the way to your favor is the high <i>road of
sincerity</i> or the bye path of <i>hypocrisy and
dissimulation</i>, and will either love and respect you, or fear
and <i>despise</i> you. If you rule justly, you will find it easy
to govern; encourage them to be kind to each other, and lovers of
peace; reprove them for their faults privately, and if possible
without the knowledge of each other; never bring up old faults;
be just and impartial in the distribution of tickets; and enter
faithfully into the Black Book all punishments and the cause of
them, and if you should have any <i>particular</i> complaint
against any one of the children, report the same to the Managers
that they may direct you how to act. You are not to use the Rod
except you have permission of the visiting Manager. It will
however be better that the children should not be aware that it
is necessary for you to obtain this permission.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<p align="center"><b>VISIT TO
AUSTRALIA&mdash;HIGHLANDMEN&mdash;CAPT. CHISHOLM LEAVES FOR
INDIA&mdash;MORALS&mdash;SIDNEY&mdash;EVILS TO BE
CONQUERED&mdash;PERILS OF FEMALE EMIGRANTS&mdash;EMIGRANT'S
BARRACKS&mdash;MEETS WITH FLORA&mdash;COMMENCEMENT OF A
HOME.</b></p>
<br>
<p>In the career of usefulness, sketched in the previous chapter,
was Mrs. Chisholm employed until 1838, when, for the benefit of
her husband's health, with her infant family she left India, to
visit the more salubrious climes of South Australia and Van
Diemen's Land. Towards the end of the year she landed at that
great field of her philanthropic exertions, Sydney. The first
objects that came under her notice, and were benefited by her
benevolence, were a party of Highland emigrants who had been sent
to the shores of a country where the language spoken was to them
strange and unknown, and without a friend to assist or guide them
in that path of honourable labour which they desired. As a
temporary means of relief Mrs. Chisholm lent them money to
purchase tools and wheelbarrows, whereby they might cut and sell
fire-wood to the inhabitants.</p>
<p>The success of this experiment was gratifying both to the
bestower and receiver, in the one it revived drooping hopes, the
other it incited to larger enterprises of humanity.</p>
<p>In January, 1840, Captain Chisholm had to join his regiment in
India, but it was considered more prudent for the health of the
family that they should remain for some time longer in the more
favourable climate of Sydney. While the devoted and noble minded
husband urged his beloved and courageous wife to carry out those
views over which they had pondered for the reformation of evils
detrimental to morality, the success of the colony, the honour of
their native country, and to the mission of man on earth.</p>
<p>Many now living may remember the laxity of national morals in
our country during the reign of a former monarch. The
<i>rou&eacute;</i> was then a character extolled, envied, and
glorified. In every large town the sustaining of this character
was the business of many men's lives, who were either high in
station, wealthy, or nearly related to others who were so. Crimes
were perpetrated that would now cause a man to be abhorred or
stand at the bar of justice. Marriages had to have the indecent
excitement of a flight to Gretna Green, disgusting elopements
were fashionable, and women considered mere automatons of dress
and passion. Female intellect was derided and shunned, that this
"noblest work" of nature might be continued in slavish animal
degradation. Morality rejoices then in the brilliant and
elevating change effected by the glorious example of a female
monarch, as now the domestic, social, and intellectual virtues
are cultivated, reverenced and esteemed as a duty that womankind
not only owes to herself but to society.</p>
<p>It cannot therefore be a matter of wonder that this miasmatic
moral depravity was wafted to our colonies where it could riot
even more freely, from being less likely to receive public
censure and exposure than at home. Painful is it to think that
the unprotected children of poverty or of crime were deemed the
rightful spoil of degraded-minded men, while the lax morality of
the colony rendered them callous to feeling, to honour, and
manliness.</p>
<p>The narratives of the treatment of females emigrating to the
shores of the New World, that reached this country were very
sparing, and by interested parties asserted to be exaggerations
or falsehoods, which for the satisfaction of conscience, was
readily admitted as the most probable representation.</p>
<p>Let us then lift the veil and see the state of Sydney when
Mrs. Chisholm arrived there, and the hydra corruption with which
in her love of her species, and dependence on the Almighty, she
nobly dared to grapple and destroy.</p>
<p>At the government depot in England, writes Mrs. Chisholm, "we
find congregated together broken up families; young couples
without children, or single young women, perhaps perfect
strangers to all around them; each party leaving behind them in
all probability, parents, brothers, sisters, &amp;c., without
almost any hope of re-union; here is a mass of human beings
inwardly lamenting their separation from those most dear to them;
they go on board under harrowed feelings, and the young women are
placed under the care of a matron, who is viewed as a very
subordinate character. These are trying situations for human
nature, and a dangerous position for young women to find
themselves in, for amongst these there exists no common feeling
except that of perfect indifference to each other,&mdash;the
innocent and the helpless stand there exposed to the wiles of the
snarer. Who has not been shocked by the frightful details we have
read in the public papers, how orphan after orphan had been
victimised on board emigrant ships by men calling themselves
Christians; how modest maidens have been brutalized over and
insulted by those whose peculiar duty it was to protect
them."</p>
<p>Upon the voyage being completed, continues Mrs. Chisholm in
her appeal to the clergy of Sydney, "one of the most serious
evils I know is the practice of young women being allowed to make
engagements on board ship. Some families of high respectability
do engage servants in this way; but I also know that some people,
of the very-worst character, go there and engage
servants&mdash;servants? No! They are not required as
servants&mdash;they are not <i>wanted to work</i>. Many have I
known who have been taken to houses of the worst character the
first day of their arrival. Shall this evil continue? God forbid!
The latter go on board ship with impunity: how can the captain or
surgeon be expected to know them? They judge from appearances. A
silk dress&mdash;a little talk about attending church on a
Sunday, and the poor girl gets high wages&mdash;leads an idle
life&mdash;visits the theatre&mdash;dresses well, and leads some
of her shipmates into the same hands. Some say it is the duty of
the clergy to prevent this system&mdash;others say, of the
ladies: that it is a duty that <i>ought to be met</i> few will
deny."</p>
<p>This was a monstrous, overgrown evil for a woman single handed
to contend with, but like a good Samaritan Mrs. Chisholm went
amongst the helpless and gave them advice, the captains and
agents she besought to act with caution and humanity, and
sacrificing every domestic comfort and privacy when she saw a
poor creature amid dangers and ruin she took her to her own
house; having as many as nine at one period there, sheltered and
protected. Still the benefit capable of being effected was so
trivial to the magnitude of the evil, that she saw it was far
beyond her limited means, in fact, it was a national work. A
stranger and uninfluential, she found her appeals must be
comparatively disregarded. A circumstance at length took place
which made her determine at all risks of ridicule and painful
public indifference to commence in earnest her mission of mercy
and charity. We prefer giving the history in the simple,
unaffected language of Mrs. Chisholm's narrative.</p>
<p>"On my first visit to the emigrants' barracks, which was about
five in the evening, my attention became fixed on a young and
beautiful Highland girl (in tent No. 1); the arm of a gentleman
was round her waist. I am a great admirer of beauty, and her
style pleased me exceedingly. On my two following visits, I still
saw the same gentleman; I observed too, a little extra
<i>finery</i> on Flora. I could not make out the name of the
gentleman, but I cautioned the poor girl's mother, and bade her
beware. The poor woman said, 'there was no fear of Flora, for her
head had never rested but on her mother's hearth.' She was all
innocence&mdash;the mother all hope. The following day, I made a
few purchases in Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s shop, in George
Street, when the same gentleman I had seen with Flora entered; an
elegant woman hung on his arm. I enquired his name&mdash;'the
lady was his wife.' I still doubted: I went to the next shop; I
enquired, whose conveyance is that?&mdash;still the same name: I
no longer doubted his intentions. The following evening, seeing
him in a tent with Flora, I made enquiries if any ladies felt an
interest in these young creatures, or afforded them protection? I
was told, there was a committee, but the ladies never visited the
institute, or in any way interfered; and after many enquiries, I
was obliged to leave Flora to her <i>fate</i>.</p>
<p>From this period I devoted all my leisure time in endeavouring
to serve these poor girls, and felt determined, with God's
blessing, never to rest until decent <i>protection</i> was
afforded them. In January, 1841, I wrote to Lady Gipps, and from
that time I never ceased in my exertions. I knew that every
ship's arrival would increase the necessity for such an
institution. I felt convinced the evil which struck me so
forcibly would soon be made apparent to the good people of
Sydney; and I felt assured that the God of all mercy would not
allow so many poor creatures to be lost, without disposing the
hearts of the people to unite and save them. I now considered the
difficulties, and prepared the plan: for three weeks I hesitated,
and suffered much. I was prepared to encounter the opposition of
some, the luke-warmness, or the actual hostility of others, to
the plan I might suggest. I saw I must have the aid of the press;
for I could only anticipate success by soliciting public sympathy
for the cause I had undertaken, notwithstanding which, as a
female and almost a stranger in the colony, I naturally felt
diffident. I was impressed with the idea, that God had, in a
peculiar manner, fitted me for the work; and yet I hesitated.
About this time, several young women, whom I had served, advised
others to write to me. I did all I could to aid them in their
prospects by advice, or recommending them to situations; but the
number increased, and I saw that my plan, if carried into effect,
would <i>serve all</i>. My delay pressed on my mind as <i>a
sin</i>; and when I heard of a poor girl suffering distress, and
losing her reputation in consequence, I felt that I was not
<i>clear of her sin</i>, for I did not do all I <i>could</i> to
prevent it.</p>
<p>During the season of Lent of that year, I suffered much; but
on the Easter Sunday, I was enabled, at the altar of our Lord, to
make an offering of my talents to the God who gave them. I
promised to know neither <i>country nor creed</i>, but to try to
serve all <i>justly</i> and impartially. I asked only to be
enabled to keep these poor girls from being tempted, by their
need, to mortal sin; and resolved that, to accomplish this, I
would in every way sacrifice my feelings&mdash;surrender all
comfort&mdash;nor, in fact, consider my own wishes or feelings,
but wholly devote myself to the work I had in hand. I felt my
offering was accepted, and that God's blessing was on my work;
but it was his will to permit many <i>serious difficulties</i> to
be thrown in my way, and to conduct me through a rugged path of
deep humiliation. I may here remark that, with one exception,
every person I wrote or spoke to on the subject acknowledged the
<i>need</i> of such an institution; promised to subscribe when
one was established, though with few exceptions, all declared
they thought the thing impossible. I determined on a visit to
Sydney,* and on my arrival there, I requested two friends to call
at the Herald office; both refused. I went myself, and am glad of
this opportunity to acknowledge the attention I met with, and the
support the proprietors of that journal gave me&mdash;indeed, to
the press of Sydney I feel indebted, and thank them sincerely for
their support. From his Excellency's letters, and what he said, I
came to this conclusion, that, under existing circumstances, he
would not refuse me, though he would <i>rather not</i> grant my
request. I knew I had an able general against me, and that much
caution, patience, and temper, were necessary on my part. I was
advised by a friend to form a committee immediately&mdash;a thing
easier said than done; but I was not certain of his Excellency,
the governor, giving me the use of a part of the immigration
barracks, and as I had more than forty letters in my possession,
detailing the miseries of some of the young women then in Sydney,
I had determined, as the forlorn hope, to publish these; and ten
of them would, I knew, be sufficient to cause a feeling on the
minds of the public, which would have raised funds at once: but I
was told their publication would injure the colony, and I had no
wish to do this, for I feel an interest in its prosperity, and
should have lamented making a <i>passing and transient</i>
distress known in England, when I was certain there would be no
necessity for this measure.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mrs. Chisholm resided at Windsor.]</p>
<p>I waited on the ladies who now form the committee,
viz.&mdash;Lady O'Connell, Lady Bowling, Mrs. Richard Jones, Mrs.
Roger Therry, Mrs. W. Mackenzie, Mrs. J. Wallan, and Miss E.
Chambers; and it is pleasing to be able to state, that not one
refused me&mdash;all expressed themselves as <i>feeling an
interest</i> in the work.</p>

WITH THE GOVERNOR&mdash;DESCRIPTION OF THE
HOME&mdash;OUTGENERALLING THE RATS&mdash;PERSONAL
SACRIFICES&mdash;STATE OF DESTITUTION.</b></p>
<br>
<p>Thus did this excellent lady labour to arouse the public to a
sense of justice and humanity on behalf of helpless females, and
project plans to efface a stain and disgrace on the colony; the
response was but feeble, private interest did not exist to
quicken into action, and man is proverbially selfish in his
deeds. Still the nucleus was formed, additional names added
weight, and a distinct plan traced out;&mdash;action and energy
were now the chief powers to be exercised to bring the scheme
into useful operation, when private interest, jealous prejudices,
and weak-mindedness, privately and publicly assailed the plan as
a wild hallucination. The ardent grew cool, the friendly frigid,
and the "first promised supporters withdrew their pledges."
Bigotry, that can no more comprehend the life-giving impulses and
ardent aspiration of the true spirit of Christianity, than the
crippled Chinese female the elastic spring of the mountain
habitant, was effectively at work as the tool of the base and
hypocritical, and by it the unthinking and weak-minded were
easily deceived, and truth distorted. The opposition raised,
though it did not daunt the spirit of Mrs. Chisholm, relying as
she did on the divine nature of her work, yet it harrassed and
wearied out her body. Even the humane and pious, erring in
judgment, advised her to relinquish her intention. Thus worn out,
she resolved to retreat to her cottage at Parramatta, that by
prayer and contemplation she might strengthen her mind to firmly
proceed in her good work, when the following circumstance, as
related by herself, took place.</p>
<p>"I started in good time, as I thought, for the Parramatta
steamer; indeed, I was so certain of this, that although a friend
overtook me in King-street with a conveyance, and told me he
should be only just in time, I refused to ride; I wished to be
alone for a few minutes; I was aware I had been much tried, and I
knew a few minutes alone would give me time to soothe my
feelings, and meet my friends at the steamer with
spirit&mdash;perhaps I did not walk so quick as usual, at all
events I was too late. I then walked towards the Flagstaff.</p>
<p>Near Petty's Hotel, I caught sight of a frail beauty; her
dress told her fate; she evidently knew, and wished to avoid me;
I was determined to overtake her; I was able to do this, for I
hurried onward; I laid my hand on her arm, and the wreck of my
Highland beauty stood before me. Alas, how different from the
lovely girl she once was! the ruddy rose of the Highlands was
changed for the tinge of rum: she had been drinking, but well
knew what she was about.</p>
<p>"Tell me where you are going?"</p>
<p>"To h&mdash;!" was the answer</p>
<p>I continued to walk by her side: she became insolent; but I
was determined not to leave her. She made for Lavender's Ferry,
and said, "my mistress lives over there." I said, ["]I will go to
the other side with you, as I want to say a few words to you. She
was unwilling; but I persisted: we crossed over; I felt certain,
from her manner, she meditated suicide; I passed to the left of
her, and bade her sit down. I knew the circumstances of her
family well, and my first question was of her mother.</p>
<p>"Did you see your mother die?" (I knew she did not, for her
mother consented to her remaining in service in Sydney.)</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"She died happy."&mdash;No reply.</p>
<p>"Are you a mother?" She seized my hand and placed it on her
heart. "God is merciful!"&mdash;she shook her head.</p>
<p>I saw a letter in her bosom; I drew it out, with her nodded
consent. It was from her brother; he <i>felt</i> her disgrace; he
taunted her with being the first in the family who had known
shame.</p>
<p>"I loved ***** better than any,
save&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;" And again she shook her
head.</p>
<p>"Your brother loves you even now."</p>
<p>"No, no."</p>
<p>"Were there any in your family who ever committed murder?"</p>
<p>She shook with horror.</p>
<p>"Then why will you?"</p>
<p>"It's there I meant to drown myself," pointing to a distant
spot; "It's there we met often, and <i>there I would
die!</i>"</p>
<p>I did not leave the place until, with subdued feelings, I
heard her vow never to attempt self-destruction, I procured her
lodgings; my spirits returned; I felt God's blessing was on my
work. From this time, I never thought of human help; I neglected
no steps to conciliate; I increased my exertions; but from the
hour I was on the beach with Flora, fear left me."</p>
<p>Sir George Gipps, the governor, looked on the plan with doubt
and suspicion. He thought Mrs. Chisholm was some wild enthusiast,
and paid the least possible attention to her letters. The
newspapers, wondering, doubting, and hesitating, discussed the
proposition. The clergy considered the object laudable and
praiseworthy, still they had doubts of the power and object of
the promoter; but as the extent of moral good to be effected
became apparent, and an appeal being made to them, through the
press, they heartily responded, all denominations vying in
assisting the indefatigable lady.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chisholm persevered nobly; and at length the governor
grudgingly granted an interview to the "<i>lady labouring under
amiable delusions.</i>" A. philanthropic lunatic was a rarity,
perhaps an excitement.</p>
<p>"I expected," said sir George Gipps, when relating the story
to an English friend, "to have seen on old lady in white cap and
spectacles, who would have talked to me about my soul. I was
amazed when my <i>aide</i> introduced a handsome, stately young
woman, who proceeded to reason the question as if she thought her
reason, and experience too, worth as much as mine."</p>
<p>At one of these interviews, after Mrs. Chisholm had explained
what she wished and intended to effect by her Emigrant's Home,
Sir George remarked, "I believe you have overrated the powers of
your own mind, and believing so, and also in your disinterested
views, I think it right to tell you."</p>
<p>Sir George at last, on receiving a guarantee against the
government being put to any expense, granted the use of a
government building. It consisted of a low wooden erection. The
room appropriated to Mrs. Chisholm's own occupation was not more
than seven feet in length and breadth, without afire-place. She
was compelled, when requiring a cup of tea, to send for water to
a public boiler, in which hundreds of kettles had been dipped. At
length a prisoner, engaged in the government printing office,
brought a kettle of boiling water every morning.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chisholm writes, "in acknowledging this boon, I would
thank lady Gipps for her kind and generous support; she strewed a
few flowers in my path&mdash;I knew them by their fragrance, and
I thanked God she had a woman's heart! But I must take possession
of my office. On closing the door, I reflected on what I had been
compelled to endure for forty nine square feet. My first feelings
were those of indignation that such a trifle had been so long
withheld; but better feelings followed. I determined to trust to
Providence, to increase its size, and prove my usefulness. I soon
observed, to do any good, I must sleep on the premises; and as
soon as Mr. Mereweather was aware of my determination, he gave me
the best room then vacant. I cannot say vacant, for it was used
as a store room. This was, however, cleared for my accommodation;
and having been busy all day, I retired wearied to rest. My
courage was put to the proof at starting. Scarce was the light
out, when I fancied, from a noise I heard, that dogs must be in
the room, and in some terror I got a light. What I experienced on
seeing rats in all directions, I cannot describe! My first act
was to throw on a cloak, and get at the door with the intent of
leaving the building. My second thoughts were, if I did so, my
desertion would cause much amusement, and ruin my plan; I
therefore lighted a second candle, and seating myself on my bed,
kept there until three rats, descending from the roof, alighted
on my shoulders. I felt that I was getting into a fever, and that
in fact I should be very ill before morning&mdash;but to be
<i>out-generalled</i> by rats was too bad. I got up with some
resolution: I had two loaves and some butter (for my office,
bedroom, and pantry were one); I cut it into slices, placed the
whole in the middle of the room, put a dish of water convenient,
and with a light by my side, I kept my seat on the bed reading
"Abercrombie", and watching the rats until four in the morning. I
at one time counted thirteen, and never less than seven did I
observe at the dish during the entire night. The following night
I gave them a similar treat, with the addition of arsenic; and in
this manner I passed my four first nights at the Home."</p>
<p>After a time, four rooms of similar size to that named, were
added, and thrown into one for the Home.</p>
<p>"My plan was to have apartments near the office for my
children, but this did not answer&mdash;at night I must be in the
Home. I gave up one child, although I could keep two with me; but
I found the elder a source of so much anxiety that I consented to
part with him. I knew under the honest care of Miss M. Galvin, of
Windsor, they would be well fed, and kindly treated, and I could
still keep one, my youngest. Some sickness among the children in
the tents told me plainly my duty, still I would not, could not
part with my dear boy. A lady, whose esteem I value, told me I
ought not to risk my child's life; that I must give up my Home,
or my selfish feeling for my child: I was aware of the truth of
the observation, but refused. At night, as was usual with me, I
saw the girls after they retired to rest. Ninety-four were in the
Home; I asked if they had any place to go to if I turned them
out; not one had a place of shelter. On my return to the office,
I found a poor woman waiting for a white gown, to make her
<i>dead bairn</i> decent. I went into my room, packed up my
little fellow's wardrobe, and the next day he was at Windsor.
This was the <i>last sacrifice</i> it was God's will <i>to
demand</i>.</p>
<p>After obtaining possession of the building, which I named the
'Female Emigrant's Home', I appealed to the public for support:
after a time, this appeal was liberally met. There were neither
sufficient arrangements made for removing emigrants into the
interior, nor for protecting females on their arrival. A few only
were properly protected, while hundreds were wandering about
Sydney without friends or protection,&mdash;great numbers of
these young creatures were thrown out of employment by new
arrivals. I received several into the Home, whom, I found, had
slept out many nights in the government domain, seeking the
sheltered recesses of the rocks rather than encounter the dangers
of the streets. It was estimated that there were 600 females, at
the time I commenced, unprovided for in Sydney. I made an offer
to the government of gratuitously devoting my time to the
superintendence of a Home of Protection for them in the town, and
also to exert myself to procure situations for them in the
country.</p>

FEMALE EMIGRANTS&mdash;WATCHFULNESS AND ITS REWARD&mdash;SORROWS
OF THE HEART SOOTHED&mdash;RESCUE OF A GIRL, AND THE GRATEFUL
BOATMAN.</b></p>
<br>
<p>One evening, says Mrs. Chisholm, just after the opening of the
Home, a gentleman of most serious demeanour called: he handed his
card, and said, as his visit was to do good, no apology could be
necessary. He commenced by saying, women were creatures of
impulse and feeling; he admired their virtues, but deplored their
<i>want</i> of judgment and stability. "You are doing wrong,
ma'am&mdash;you are sending souls to perdition! to send girls to
the country is monstrous. I am an old colonist, a man of
experience, the father of a family; you do not know the
country&mdash;the people are worse than barbarians, they are
monsters." I told him I had visited Goulborn and Port Macquarie,
and I saw no danger in either. "Bad places, ma'am; Bathurst and
Yass are horrible&mdash;if you only knew half the horrors of
these places! but see&mdash;(he dragged out a roll from his
pocket)&mdash;read these, ma'am." I found his packet consisted of
extracts from the Sydney papers, giving an account of all the
murders and outrages for years past. "Read these and abandon your
<i>country plan</i>." Seizing the papers, he walked up and down
the office. "If you do not, I will publish the whole&mdash;yes,
2,000 copies&mdash;I will let the people of England know what
they may expect if they send their daughters to New South Wales."
His step be came more hurried, and I really thought him mad, and
quietly removed the pen-knife and ruler. I knew that even madmen
will sometimes fall into the same pace as their keepers, I
therefore joined him in his promenade, and he soon kept pace with
me. I asked him what was to be done with the girls in Sydney,
that there was not honest employment for them, and that many were
losing character. "Human depravity&mdash;the want of God's grace,
or rather, the want of gospel preachers." I ventured to ask what
church he attended; he acknowledged he had been under the
ministry of five, but, according to his opinion, they were not
faithful preachers. I promised to look through his horrid
collection; and so far yielded to his earnest entreaties as to
tell him I would seriously consider what he said; at the same
time I told him, if I failed, my failure would be a valuable
appendage to his book; for, that the fact being proved that girls
lost character in the country, would strengthen his argument.</p>
<p>"Yes facts are stubborn things, Mrs. Chisholm, I once had a
sister, but she is dead&mdash;worse than dead!" He paced the
room. "I did not mean to tell you this a villain, a convict,
ruined my sister!"</p>
<p>"Does she live in sin?"</p>
<p>"I believe not."</p>
<p>"Is she in poverty?"</p>
<p>"She is, and justly deserves it."</p>
<p>"That is not the doctrine of the gospel; have you seen her
lately?"</p>
<p>"Not during the last four years."</p>
<p>"Have you given her any pecuniary assistance during that
time?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"How much?"</p>
<p>"I think seven pounds."</p>
<p>"Where is her seducer?"</p>
<p>"In Van Dieman's Land."</p>
<p>"Have you the means to aid her? for if she does not live in
sin, it is your duty; who knows but this night she may he in
want?"</p>
<p>"She brought it on herself."</p>
<p>"Where does she live?"</p>
<p>"In &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; street."</p>
<p>I told him that his pride would be brought low&mdash;that she
might do something to bring him to public disgrace. I spoke of
his mother&mdash;his father&mdash;and I saw <i>home feelings were
doing their work</i>. I determined on taking <i>advantage</i> of
his feelings. I put on my cloak and bonnet, and opening the door,
said, this is the moment, the night, for a work of mercy. I shall
go and see your sister; you must go too.</p>
<p>"But see, it rains."</p>
<p>Now as I stood as fair a chance of a sprinkling <i>inside</i>
the building as <i>out</i>, it was no great sacrifice to me; and
I pointed out the advantage of a night that kept the careful at
home. He followed, and in less than forty minutes we were at
Alice's door.</p>
<p>She occupied the half of a kitchen, in
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;street; she had been washing, but was then
at her needle; and as she sat, looked respectable; her face
brightened as I spoke of giving her work. I questioned her as to
her circumstances; her tale was soon told: she struggled hard to
pay her rent, and to keep herself and child decent.</p>
<p>I asked if she was married?</p>
<p>"No; but if I could get to Van Dieman's Land, George would
marry me."</p>
<p>"Have you no friends?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"No relations?"</p>
<p>"Yes, a brother" in a low voice "an only brother."</p>
<p>There was a movement from the door; nature had done its work.
I retreated, that I might be no restraint on this happy
reconciliation; my feelings could not be explained. Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; came out.</p>
<p>"Have you given her any money?"</p>
<p>"No; how much shall I give her?"</p>
<p>"All you have in your pocket&mdash;I see it's all
hers&mdash;give her &pound;10. You must not <i>break</i> God's
blessing; devote it to her; pay her passage; employ some friend
to see her married; stock a nice farm; in fact, you must make a
decent woman of your sister."</p>
<p>I continued to talk to my silent companion; he saw me, to the
Home door; he shook hands with me, and so fervent was his
acknowledgment, that my fingers ached for an hour afterwards.</p>
<p>I think I shall not give offence by stating a few particulars
of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. He was the <i>gentleman</i> of the
family; he had received a good education; he had a little money;
he and his sister came to the colony on the death of their
mother. Alice was a humble and affectionate girl; she acted as
his servant; they did not even dine together; she was contented,
and he was happy: he was getting on. He kept a "government man"
that could read and write&mdash;never was a servant more
attentive to his mistress; but still, to use Alice's words, "I
never had a thought of him then." About this time, making butter
paid remarkably well; Alice was a good dairy woman; the brother
was tempted to take a farm, and send his sister to it; the
"government servant" accompanied her; true, the brother did
intend to send a man and his wife to her aid; but the butter came
regularly; it sold well; and he <i>forgot [h]is duty&mdash;hence
her ruin</i>; his long resentment followed; his change from one
religion to another for it has been wisely ordered, that a heart
full of resentment shall never find peace."</p>
<p>Seeing this gentleman afterwards, he said to Mrs. Chisholm,
that he had come to the resolution never to cut out extracts from
newspapers, or visit a philanthropist with money in his
pocket.</p>
<p>This recital beautifully illustrates the active works of mercy
and charity which Mrs. Chisholm was ready to seize every
opportunity of practising. While the mind naturally reverts to
the history of sympathy and affection to the sinner that is
recorded in the acts of our divine Teacher, and from which the
Christian mind derives its impulse.</p>
<p>It having been the custom for gentlemen and idlers to frequent
the emigrant's barracks, Mrs Chisholm found it a task of some
difficulty and delicacy to stop this practice, and have only one
place of ingress and egress instead of many. Those points,
however, she succeeded in accomplishing.</p>
<p>"Although the Home was crowded", says Mrs. Chisholm, I could
not get a girl to go into the country&mdash;I found it necessary
to go first myself. A party promised to be ready, but their fears
overcame their good resolutions, and I had the dray to send away
empty (this I kept a secret.) I had ninety-six on rations, a
serious number; however I ordered two drays the next day, and
sent them off in spirits. The inmates of the Home being most
suited to rough country work, I proceeded into the interior, to
form committees, and to establish country "Homes", taking, in
some cases, parties of females with me; When I commenced taking
them up the country, I had to meet, in the first instance, their
travelling expenses, which were afterwards refunded. The
inhabitants of the district cheerfully supplied them with food;
the committees afforded them protection and advice. I took them
to Campbell-Town, Maitland, Liverpool, Paramatta, and Port
Macquarie. The first parties of young women varied from fifteen
to sixty in number. I went from farm to farm, getting them places
in service. I quickly disposed of the first venture, and then
returned to Sydney, after having made arrangements for the
establishment of country depots. I also got married families to
promise shelter and protection to such young females as might
require it.</p>
<p>Soon after the opening of the Sydney Home, I received
sixty-four girls from ships then in harbour, and all the money
they had amounted to fourteen shillings and three half-pence;
twenty-two had no money; several two-pence; others four-pence.
These girls I sent into the country, The majority are married,
and not one lost her character."</p>
<p>One evening when Mrs. Chisholm was taking her rounds to see
that all was right outside the establishment, she saw a party of
men trying to conceal two girls. She immediately went to the
young unthinking females and asked them if they had friends in
the colony, and as they had not, desired them to go into the
Home. One only did so. In a few minutes Mrs. Chisholm and the
girl went back to induce the other to leave the men, when they
were surrounded by the rough lawless looking fellows. They stated
they had come to her to apologize, that knowing she did not get a
penny for all her labour, and did it only for the good of the
girls, they were not the men to obstruct her in her endeavours,
and then bid her good night. One of these men afterwards came and
privately besought Mrs. Chisholm to save a young girl who was in
danger, She did so&mdash;the girl got well married&mdash;and thus
the adventure of that night was the means of enlisting others in
her virtuous mission.</p>
<p>No one ever undertook a voluntary unthankful and gratuitous
duty upon themselves, and executed it with more personal
sacrifice, careful watchfulness, and humanity, than did Mrs.
Chisholm in carrying out the intention of the Homes. Those whom
she had under her protection, had a maternal and friendly eye
ever upon them, never would she sleep away from her flock, if a
barn floor or the bush was their portion, she cheerfully partook
of its inconveniences; and her regard for their feelings was
beautifully illustrated by her custom, when all were supposed to
be asleep, of gently entering then: dormitory. If she saw a
closed eye, which by its tremulous motion, betrayed it was not
sleep that hid the orb below, or the cheek glistened with recent
tears, Mrs. Chisholm would affectionately whisper to the party to
rise and follow her to her little apartment. The source of woe
was enquired into, perhaps some near or dear relative in afar off
land, or feelings lacerated by separation from the object of the
heart&mdash;was the tale recounted. They were soothed and
comforted&mdash;hope was held out&mdash;and the will of God shown
in the steps of humankind. The very opening of the mind to one
who breathed words of sympathy gave courage and ease to those who
knew not of a friend before to whom they could unbosom the secret
turmoil of their feelings, and they entered with spirit and
confidence on their future career.</p>
<p>We cannot forbear relating another instance of the watchful
zeal with which Mrs. Chisholm prosecuted her good work. A vessel
arrived and it was mentioned that a beautiful young girl had
attracted much notice on board; when the females came to the
Home, one was missing from those who had left the ship&mdash;this
proved to be the favourite. Mrs. Chisholm then learnt that the
ship's boat had been seen hovering about, and she immediately
engaged one in the harbour and proceeding to the place which she
suspected as the most likely resort, and there discovered the
misled girl. She told her if she returned at once she would not
be missed, and avoid such a disgrace. The girl hesitated, her
companion was insolent, but Mrs. Chisholm was firm, and
threatened exposure in the public press&mdash;he quailed at the
mention of the press. May the press of Sydney long maintain its
power and preserve its influence! Each paper has its own
interest; each editor his own opinion; but in the exposure of
villany&mdash;in any <i>moral</i> movement, <i>they are
one</i>.</p>
<p>"I went to the girl," says Mrs. Chisholm, "led her on towards
the boat, and desired her to get in willingly, that the man
should suppose it was entirely her own will. I was hastening
along when the man who had been with the girl followed and said,
"I must have one word with you; that poor girl is innocent and
good&mdash;do you believe it?"</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>"Then may God bless you!"</p>
<p>He assisted me into the boat, and was soon out of sight. I
landed at the jetty, and on offering the boatman his hire, he
refused, to accept it, in a manner at once respectful and
grateful.</p>
<p>"You do not know me, ma'am, but I know you; and may my arm
wither from the socket, if ever I touch money of yours."</p>
<p>"Why, I have never seen you before&mdash;who are you?"</p>
<p>"Flora's cousin."</p>
<p>Alas, poor Flora! many loved you.</p>

OVERCOME&mdash;INCONVENIENCE OF FAME.</b></p>
<br>
<p>While the affairs we have narrated were proceeding in favour
of the destitute females, Mrs. Chisholm did not loose sight of
the interests of the male emigrants. She found many arrived quite
ignorant of the manners and customs of the colony, and were
therefore, in many instances, imposed upon. Frequently the
agreement was that wages had not to commence until the arrival of
the employed at the place where he had to labour, which might be
a three weeks journey; the luggage was heavily charged for
conveyance; perhaps the food supplied was innutritious, while the
poor man was liable to be discharged at a moment's notice, the
verbal arrangement being often disputed. To check this evil Mrs.
Chisholm commenced a registry office for servants, having a
printed form of agreement. This document was signed by both the
employer and employed, and kept at the office. A duplicate being
given to both parties. On this was stated the wages, the day of
their commencement, the notice to leave required to be given, the
supply of flour or of corn, fresh or salt meat, and other
particulars. This new system was not at first liked, but as both
master and servant perceived their interests were served, they
readily availed themselves of the bond. Out of all the agreements
made ten only were ever disputed, and they were arranged by a
reference to the original documents At the time labourers were
required in the interior there were numbers idle in Sydney,
supported at the expense of the government. Things wore a serious
aspect, mischief-making parties, for some paltry gain, fed the
spirit of discontent. The Irish lay in the streets, looking
vacantly, and basking in the sun. Apart from them, Englishmen,
sullen in feature, sat on gates and palings, letting their legs
swing in the air. Another group was composed of Scotchmen, their
hands thrust into their empty pockets, suspiciously glancing at
every thing and every body from beneath their bushy eyebrows.
Mrs. Chisholm ventured to produce a change, she provided for the
leaders first, showed how she desired to be the friend of the
industrious man, and went with numbers in search of employment,
far into the country. She undertook journeys of 300 miles into
the interior with families; and the farther she went the more
satisfactory was the settlement of the parties accompanying this
brave lady.</p>
<p>"When the public had an opportunity of judging of the effect
of my system," writes Mrs. Chisholm, "they came forward and
enabled me to go on. The government contributed, in various ways,
to the amount of about &pound;150. I met with great assistance
from the country committees. The squatters and settlers were
always willing to give me conveyance for the people. The country
people always supplied provisions. Mr. William Bradley, a native
of the colony, authorized me to draw upon him for money,
provisions, horses, or anything I might require, but the people
met my efforts so readily that I had no necessity to draw upon
him for a sixpence. At public inns the females were sheltered,
and I was provisioned myself without charge: my personal expenses
during my seven years' service amounted to only &pound;1. 18s.
6d.</p>
<p>As numbers of the masters were afraid, if they advanced the
money for the conveyance by the steamers, the parties would never
reach the stations. I met the difficulty by advancing the fare,
confiding in the good feeling of the man that he would keep to
his agreement, and to the principle of the master that he would
repay me. Although in hundreds of cases the masters were then
strangers to me, I only lost &pound;16. by casualties. At times,
I have paid as much as &pound;40. for steamers, and, from first
to last, in following out my system, I have been the means of
settling 11,000 souls. The largest number that ever left Sydney
under my charge, at one time, was 147, but, from accessions on
the road, they increased considerably. The longest journey of
this kind occupied five weeks; three weeks of which were passed
on the road.</p>
<p>The rate of wages for a single man averaged &pound;20 per
annum, with weekly rations of flour 9 lbs., meat 10 lbs., tea 2
oz., sugar 1&frac12; lbs. A married man and his wife, with one
child, &pound;25. per annum, and weekly rations of, meat 18 lbs.,
flour 20 lbs., tea 4 oz., sugar 3 lbs.</p>
<p>I established a female registry office in Sydney where all
persons that required service used to attend in the morning, from
ten till four. My first endeavour was always to get one female
servant placed in a neighbourhood, and having succeeded thus far
left the feeling to spread. With some persuasion I induced a man
to take a servant, who said that it would be making a fine lady
of his wife. The following morning a neighbouring settler said,
'You are quite upsetting the settlement, Mrs. Chisholm; my wife
is uncommonly cross this morning, and says she must have a
servant, and I think she has as much right to one as others.' It
was among this class that the girls married best. If they married
one of the sons, the father and mother would be thankful; if not,
they would be protected as members of the family&mdash;they slept
in the same room with their own daughters. I have been able to
learn the subsequent progress in life of many hundreds of these
emigrants. Girls that I have taken up the country, in such a
destitute state that I have been obliged to get a decent dress to
put upon them, have come to me again, having every comfort about
them, and wanting servants. They are constantly writing home to
get out their friends and relatives."</p>
<p>Of the system pursued by Mrs. Chisholm, the colonial emigrant
agent says, "I do not think a better plan could be adopted than
that one pursued about the end of the year 1841 and beginning of
1842, during a great influx of emigrants. Advantage was taken of
return drays, by means of which they were removed, in small
numbers at a time, and at a very moderate expense, into the
inland districts. To districts on the coast they were sent by
steamers, and were, in the first instance, committed to the care
of the police magistrates, and subsequently received into
'Homes', specially provided for the purpose, and supported partly
at the expense of the districts, <i>and partly by contributions
from the government</i>."</p>
<p>It is curious to observe in the above evidence the official
manner of hiding the short comings of government, and by
implication, seizing upon any credit that arose from a sound
plan. Honestly, he should have said that these Homes had been
established, and the emigrants distributed, from the
arrangements, and by the personal labour, and pecuniary risk of
Mrs. Chisholm, and that the only assistance from government was a
tardy contribution of &pound;150., or about one-tenth of the
total expenses.</p>
<p>The following extract from a circular will give an idea of the
business-like style in which Mrs. Chisholm went to
work;&mdash;</p>
<p align="right"><i>Jamieson Street, Sydney, Oct</i>.
21<i>st</i>, 1841.</p>
<p>"Sir, I am endeavouring to establish a 'Home for Female
Emigrants', and, as my first object is to facilitate their
obtaining employment in the country, I shall feel obliged if you
will favour my intention (should you <i>approve</i> of the same)
by giving me the information I require regarding your district;
and any suggestion you may think useful will be considered a
favour.</p>
<p>"1st. Whether girls who at home have merely been accustomed to
milk cows, wash, and the common household work about a farm,
would readily get places? at what wages? and how many do you
think would, in the course of the next two years, be
required?</p>
<p>"2nd. Good Servants, such as housemaids and cooks, the rate of
wages? and the probable number required for the same period?</p>
<p>"3rd. Married couples with small families, say two or three
children, ditto?</p>
<p>"4th. Could employment and protection be found for boys and
girls from seven to fourteen years of age?</p>
<p>"5th. Have you had opportunities of observing if the young
women can save any part of their wages? for they are generally of
opinion that nothing can be saved in the country, every article
of wearing apparel being so much dearer than in town.</p>
<p>"6th. What would be the cheapest and best way of conveying the
young women to your district?</p>
<p>"I have to observe that the servants will be classed according
to their qualifications, and distributed fairly, so that those
who are absent will have an <i>equal chance</i> of getting a good
servant with those who are present."</p>
<p>In 1842, we find in one of the Sydney journals; "Mrs.
Chisholm, the undaunted and enterprising bush pioneer writes: 'I
wish you would use your interest to try and borrow a horse and
covered cart for me. I require the cart to sleep in at night, and
carry little children by day; I have a saddle-horse for my own
use. I have now provided for seventy families; the weather is,
however, very changeable, and I require a covered cart to enable
me to continue my exertions.'"</p>
<p>It was during one of these journeys that a gentleman
travelling came up to a party of emigrants camped on the side of
a swampy ford. He found Mrs. Chisholm employed in effecting the
passage of the women and children; she made her docile horse
cross the ford with two children at a time, slung across his back
hammock-like, encouraging him with her voice each time until all
were safely landed. She had previously ridden thirty miles in
search of employment for the parties.</p>
<p>On one occasion, arriving at a particular location and finding
the surveyor's work incomplete, Mrs. Chisholm at once took the
chain in hand and divided off the plots as well, for all
practical purposes, as if performed by the most scientific man of
business.</p>
<p>At another time she writes, "When we landed from the steamer
and entered into the bush, we found there was 110 water. I had
thirty women and children in the party, all tired, hungry, and
thirsty, the children crying. Without saying a word, I sent one
of my old bushmen off on horseback three miles to get enough of
milk or water for the children. In the meantime, some of the
emigrants came up and said, in a discontented tone, 'Mrs.
Chisholm, this is a pretty job, what must we do? there is no
water.' I knew it would not do for them to be idle; anything was
better than that in their frame of mind; so partly judging from
the locality, I said to them without hesitation, 'If you will dig
here, I think you will find water.' Directing the tools to be got
out, they immediately set to work, and providentially, they had
not dug many feet when they came to water. This had such an
exhilarating effect upon their spirits, that they instantly threw
off their coats, began to dig two other fresh holes, and did not
leave of till moonlight."</p>
<p>On one of her first journeys, she was met by a discontented
party of emancipists, shepherds, and shearers, of the district,
who said, "we believe you are a very good sort of a person, Mrs.
Chisholm, and have great respect for you; but we cannot allow
emigrants here to lower our wages." Her answer was, "I hear you
want wives, is that true?" The reply was a universal "Yes."
"Then, don't you see, I can't send single girls into a district
where there are only bachelors. Let me fix a few married families
down on the different stations, and I will send to them decent
single lasses that you can marry."</p>
<p>This settled the question: a government officer on the same
errand would have been mobbed.</p>
<p>At one station, where a female was in charge, the utmost
alacrity was shown in providing for the party, and Mrs. Chisholm
was informed there was a nice snug bed-room made up for her. "My
good neighbour," replied the lady, "I must sleep where my girls
sleep."</p>
<p>Accommodation was then made in the large room of the house,
and all slept under cover. Breakfast was ordered at five o'clock,
as Mrs. Chisholm always found the advantage of an early start. On
demanding her bill she was told it was at the door, on reaching,
which she found a strange horse, ready saddled. "Where is
Captain?" the name of her favourite horse, which is well known
all over the colony, demanded the lady. "I have sent him on early
this morning to the next station that he might have a rest,"
replied the female inhabitant of the bush: "and there are some
provisions to help yourself and party on the road; as to payment,
we are all in your debt, your good actions pay us all." This
kindness was of frequent occurrence, and displays the feeling of
the settlers.</p>
<p>Difficulties had frequently to be met by policy. A large party
of men, on one occasion, hung sadly behind, she saw discontent on
their countenances, and that the slightest spark would cause an
explosion and countermarch of the whole. Affecting not to
perceive it, she told them they must feel fatigued but that soon
they would have a rest and something to eat. Then leading them
about two miles out of the road they arrived at a station. The
bushman preferred plenty of food. "Well," said Mrs. Chisholm,
"while the meal is being made ready, let us have a little
chat."</p>
<p>"Who owns that corn in your barn?"</p>
<p>"Why, ma'am, who should but me?"</p>
<p>"Who owns the house?"</p>
<p>"It's mine."</p>
<p>"How many cattle do you call your own?"</p>
<p>"Sixteen cows, five hundred sheep, and eight horses."</p>
<p>"What will you get for your corn?"</p>
<p>"Why, there it is, if any body wants it I'll sell it: I have
plenty of every thing, I don't want money. I have been free four
years; I have gained what I have by my own work, and there's not
a man in all your party, if he choses, but may do the same."</p>
<p>The food was eaten with a relish; ail were in high spirits;
and after starting the difficulty was to keep up to them, so
eager were they to proceed. The inconvenience of fame is
sometimes felt, thus: on arriving for the first time in a remote
district, a rough bushman came up and said, "Well, Mrs. Chisholm,
I have been waiting for your coming some time, here's this new
fashioned machine of mine somehow wont work." Mrs. Chisholm
declared her inability to rectify it; the bushman was
incredulous, but upon being assured this was the fact he went
about saying to his neighbours that he thought nothing of Mrs.
Chisholm, whom people said could do all things and everything,
she could not direct how his machine was to be mended, so was no
cleverer than other people. Mrs. Chisholm felt this was injurious
to the prestige of her renown, and as she "ever stooped to gain
all sorts of knowledge"&mdash;that is, if she had work to be done
by a blacksmith or carpenter, she saw it done, and enquired the
reason for various operations,&mdash;therefore, on returning to
Sydney she took care to learn the mechanism necessary for the
repairs of the implement in question, and visiting the district
in about three months afterwards, she was able to direct the
necessary repairs. "Aye, that's it, I knew if you would try you
could do it&mdash;every body said so of Mrs. Chisholm," cried the
delighted bushman, and she was reinstated, in the mind of the
rough countryman, as the presiding genius of Australia.</p>

BEAUTY&mdash;LITTLE SCRUB&mdash;THE HAPPINESS OF SOMETHING
REPULSIVE&mdash;HOW OPINIONS DIFFER RESPECTING SERVANTS&mdash;AN
EASY LIGHT PLACE&mdash;FIRST REPORT OF THE HOME.</b></p>
<br>
<p>Of the singular and presumptuous ideas of emigrants we have an
interesting account portrayed by Mrs. Chisholm in her "Pictures
of Australian Emigrants".</p>
<p>Many applications were made by young women who professed to be
governesses, but were utterly incompetent for such a situation.
Among others came M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; R&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
who offered herself as nursery governess; and whom Mrs. Chisholm
found could neither write, read, nor spell correctly. The
following dialogue, exemplary of profession and practice, too
common in all societies, took place.</p>
<p>"Can you wash your own clothes?"</p>
<p>"Never did such a thing in my life."</p>
<p>"Can you make a dress?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Cook?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"What can you do?"</p>
<p>"Why, ma'am, I could look after the servants; I could direct
them: I should make an excellent housekeeper."</p>
<p>"You are certain?"</p>
<p>"Yes, or I would not say so."</p>
<p>"Do you know the quantity of the different ingredients wanted
for a beefsteak-pie of the size of that dish, and a rice pudding
of the same size?"</p>
<p>"Oh no, ma'am that's not what I meant: <i>I'd see that the
servants did it</i>!"</p>
<p>"But there might be great waste, and you not know it; besides,
all, or nearly all, the servants sent to this colony require
teaching.</p>
<p>Nothing, observes Mrs. Chisholm, but my faith in Providence,
that there must be a place fitting for every body in society,
enabled me to bear such inflictions; this faith made me labour in
seeking some suitable employment for each, and had I not
possessed it, but turned them out, their fate would have been
inevitable and horrible.</p>
<p>Our next extract is illustrative of higher class would-be
governesses.</p>
<p>"R&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was entered as a governess; I was glad
of this, for I had then several applications from the country for
governesses,: [<i>sic</i>] she was a pretty girl, too; and I
knew, when pretty girls have no money&mdash;no
friends&mdash;Sydney is a very bad place for them. There is
nothing so unpleasant as to question a young lady as to her
competency. She could teach music, French, drawing, &amp;c.; she
was satisfied with the salary, and her testimonials were <i>first
rate</i>.</p>
<p>"You say you can teach music?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Ma'am."</p>
<p>"You thoroughly understand it?"</p>
<p>"Most certainly."</p>
<p>"One of your pupils is nine years of age. How long do you
think it will take her to get through Cramer's Instruction
Book?"</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you have not seen it?"</p>
<p>"No, ma'am; but I was very quick myself&mdash;I have a good
ear for music."</p>
<p>"What book did you study from?"</p>
<p>"I learnt singing and music at the same time."</p>
<p>"Tell me the name of the first piece you played?"</p>
<p>"Cherry ripe."</p>
<p>"The second?"</p>
<p>"Home, sweet Home."</p>
<p>"The third?"</p>
<p>"We're a'nodding."</p>
<p>I said no more about music. I gave her a sum to do in
addition; and she made a total of sixteen pounds five shillings
come to eighteen pounds four shillings. Now this girl, I
afterwards ascertained, at home had lived in a family as
nursemaid, and washed the clothes of five children every week;
but she was a pretty girl&mdash;somewhat of a favourite at sea; I
removed her the following day far from any pernicious
influence.</p>
<p>One girl, having health and strength, had refused five
situations; at last I thought I had suited her. She was to live
in a settler's family and teach five children to read and write;
she was not required to wash the children; but as the good and
thrifty woman kept no servants, she was to wash her own clothes
(or pay for the same out of her wages,) make her own bed, and
clean her own room: the good woman also said, she would teach her
anything she knew, but ask her to do nothing. I thought there
could be no objection to this; but when I told her, once a week
she must scour her own room (the best in the house)&mdash;when I
said this&mdash;she burst into a passionate flood of tears; the
degradation was more than she could bear! I thought it then my
duty to refuse her the benefit of the Home. In less than three
months this victim of false pride was living
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;; anything rather than work: I have
since regretted I did not give her one more trial.</p>
<p>"Pretty girls," writes Mrs. Chisholm, "no matter what their
qualifications or characters, were difficult to dispose of; they
are not, it appears, liked as servants, though they are preferred
as wives.</p>
<p>Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, wanted a servant; I sent
one&mdash;a good servant girl, and a very beautiful girl, I
acknowledge. I thought the place would suit her&mdash;no son in
the house&mdash;no nephews&mdash;cook married&mdash;groom
married&mdash;quite a safety. In less than an hour the girl
returned, with the following note:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My dear madam,</p>
<p class="indent">What can you be thinking of, to send such a
handsome girl to my house? Heavens, the place would be beset!
besides, I do not like such showy women in my house; send me a
plain, homely looking girl, and oblige yours, &amp;c."</p>
<p>I always found it wearisome work to get pretty girls off; but
after much patience, and many disappointments, I generally
succeeded. Some ladies were easily pleased; but I had one I could
not suit. She would go to a girl:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Can you make up a room very neat?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>
<p>"Can you cook?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>
<p>"Can you work well at your needle?"</p>
<p>"I can do plain work neatly."</p>
<p>Looking at her from top to toe&mdash;after a pause&mdash;"Ah,
you won't do; it's a thorough servant I want."</p>
<p>Day after day did she repeat this; and, when it had occurred
for at least the twentieth time, I went into my own room,
mustered over in my mind her different objections to different
girls, and came at last to a conclusion and a decision.</p>
<p>The same evening I received a cargo of sixty girls, one of
them a parish pauper, her hair not combed, her face not washed;
her clothes looked as if she had first jumped into, and then
slept in, them; her features and figure quite justifying the name
she had earned from her shipmates of "Little Scrub". A gentleman
who was present at the time said, "I suppose you intend her for
the bush?" I answered, "There is a place for every body in this
world, and I think I have had one waiting for her several weeks
past." On the following morning the fastidious lady came, and I
saw at once that, while reviewing the late arrivals, her eye fell
with peculiar complacency on Little Scrub.</p>
<p>Being rather afraid that I could not keep as grave a
countenance as the gravity of the affair required, I thought it
best to call her into my own room, and told her that I had a girl
that would suit "not a good servant, but a good girl." I then
called in Little Scrub, and the following dialogue took
place&mdash;</p>
<p>"Can you wash?"</p>
<p>Staring wildly. "Wash, marm!"</p>
<p>"Can you cook?"</p>
<p>"Cook, marm!"</p>
<p>"Can you make a bed!"</p>
<p>"Make a bed, marm!"</p>
<p>"Will you do all that this lady bids you?"</p>
<p>"Oh! yes, marm."</p>
<p>The lady looked at the poor girl with the scrutinizing and
pleased air of a connoisseur in front of a fine dusty picture,
and her countenance glowed with satisfaction.</p>
<p>"I will take the girl", said she; "I dare say she will turn
out a good servant. Oh, Mrs. Chisholm, you've not been long in
this colony: it takes years to know it. You will make the
agreement for six months. (With a deep sigh.) Oh, it is such a
comfort to have something a little <i>repulsive</i>!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Chisholm's favourite axiom, or faith in Providence, "that
there must be a place for every body" seems borne out by the
contradictory opinion of mistresses in regard to the same
servants; thus one writes, "I received last week the servant you
sent me; when I saw her I was astonished <i>how you</i> could
have selected such a person for <i>my family</i>. She has, as I
fully expected <i>she would</i> prove herself, an idle, lazy,
dirty, insolent, girl." Another place was procured for this same
girl, and four months afterwards her new mistress writes; "As
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, whom you were so
kind as to send to us, has conducted herself <i>remarkably
well</i>, I am induced to trouble you again on the subject of
servants. Our housemaid is about to leave us, Mrs. would rather
trust to <i>your selection</i> than her own."</p>
<p>The next example proves how much depends on temper: a lady
writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I don't think it possible you could have seen the girl you
sent me. I have had great experience; have had numbers from the
factory, but, in all my life, I never met <i>with any person who
tried me as</i> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; did.
I was <i>incessantly talking to her</i>, but it was of no use:
and, as I cannot be <i>everlastingly teased</i>, I returned her
to you. She is slow at her work; abominably filthy in her habits;
and was, to me, most insolent. I would not <i>keep her for
nothing</i>."</p>
<p>This girl's next mistress, some months afterwards, writes, "I
send in &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; for medical
advice; she has hurt her hand; if you will allow her to sleep a
night or two in the Home, I shall consider it a favour. I shall
also feel obliged if you will send me a girl to assist
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; at her work until she
gets well; for we have found her such a <i>deserving good
girl</i>, we would gladly do all in our power for her. With our
best thanks for your kindness, I remain, &amp;c., &amp;c."</p>
<p>A lady writing for a servant says, "As I keep two other
servants, I have put on a piece of paper all this girl will have
to do; and you must read it over, and explain every part of it,
so that there may be no mistake afterwards. * * Mine is a very
easy, light place." The duties referred to are: "To be dressed at
half-past six; the hall and steps to be cleaned by half-past
seven; the breakfast to be ready by eight; three beds to be made
by nine; walk with the children till ten; needlework until
eleven; to cook the children's dinner, and have it ready by
half-past twelve; then she will have to dust the dining-room out,
(and once a week to clean the windows) this she can do well by a
quarter-past one; needlework till three; lay the cloth; wait at
table. Now, she has nothing to do with washing the dishes, only
the glasses, though I give her till half-past four; then she can
take the children out; give them their tea, wash them, and put
them to bed&mdash;this will be over by seven, when she can amuse
herself with needlework. Of course she takes the entire charge of
the children's clothes, which, I have a right to expect, should
be kept in good order. I am no way particular what religion she
is, but she must attend family prayers&mdash;I would not take her
else. Say wages from &pound;10. to &pound;14.; but this I suppose
I must leave to you."</p>
<p>A summary of the benefits derived from the Sydney Female
Emigrant's Home is thus stated by Mrs. Chisholm in the first
report published of the Institution.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the institution, 735 young women
have been provided with situations, at wages varying from
&pound;10. to &pound;18. a year. Of this number 291 have been
distributed in the country districts, of whom only 211 had been
in service at home; 108 were orphans who had received their
education in charity schools; 394 were Roman Catholics, 107 of
whom could read, whilst 81 could read and write: 238 were
Protestants of the Established Church; of these 42 could read,
and 35 read and write, and 103 were Presbyterians, 35 of whom
could read, and 21 read and write: total number of Irish, 516;
English, 184; Scotch, 35. To the number of 131 was taken by
parties who never before kept servants; 13 have broken their
agreements, whilst 26 employers have broken theirs; 8 have had
charges of drunkenness brought against them, two of which were
proved; 5 were charged with thefts, none of which could be
substantiated: 2 were guilty of insolence: I obtained a situation
by a false character, and 19 were removed from their situations
by the secretary; 13 left their places without giving notice; 17
were discharged without notice by their employers, and 2 after
eight o'clock in the evening without any charge being proved
against their characters; 19 left their places with proper
notice, and have not been paid their wages; in Sydney 81 have
changed their situations; in the country 11; pecuniary assistance
has been afforded to 47 persons, and 263 have received donations
of provisions. The amount of subscriptions received is
&pound;156.; the expenditure, &pound;154.; cash in hand,
&pound;2.; subscriptions due, &pound;41.; debts none."</p>

<p align="center"><b>THE DO NOTHING EMIGRANTS&mdash;CONDESCENDING
TO TAKE A COUNTRY MAGISTRACY&mdash;A PLOUGHMAN TURNED
GENTLEMAN&mdash;A PAUPER WITH A COMPLICATION OF
DISEASES&mdash;HOW HE IS MANAGED AND PASSED OFF.</b></p>
<br>
<p>Having given a few characteristic anecdotes of the females
whom Mrs. Chisholm had to manage, we will now exhibit the other
sex. The "do-nothings" or "black-riband gentry" are a class
which, Mrs. Chisholm says, "are numerous; amongst them men are to
be found, who enter themselves as clerks or tutors, who are as
ignorant of the duties of one as they are incapable of filling
the office of the other. Some of these men by dint of impudence,
push themselves into a little consequence on board ship. When
they appeared at my office, I instantly said, 'are you one of the
emigrants, per ship &mdash;&mdash;?' Their usual hesitating
answer was, 'I came by that ship.' (They wished to lead me to
suppose they paid their own passage, or, if I would oblige them
by taking them as cabin passengers it would be as well) 'What
situation do you want?' 'O ma'am, I'm in no particular hurry; I'm
on the look out for a government situation; I have some very good
letters; I have one to the attorney-general; and I expect he will
offer me the <i>clerkship of the bench</i>; I am told it is a
very fair thing to begin with.' Another told me he expected Mr.
Thomson would make him an out country magistrate. 'Why, I am
certain Mr. Thomson never promised you that.' 'No, ma'am; but all
I want is a note from you, just to say that <i>I'd take it</i>,
and I am sure he would give it me.' I told him I had no interest
in that quarter, and if I had I would not recommend any person
for a situation he could not fill I gave him good advice; told
him he must work; that it was the only certain way of getting on
in this country."</p>
<p>This class, observes the discriminating lady "seems to be
manufactured on board ship: as soon as they land in Sydney, they
go to a draper's shop, and purchase two yards and a quarter of
black riband; this is put round their necks&mdash;sometimes a
spy-glass is suspended; this is, however, rare&mdash;a
dressing-case key, with a silver top, is the favourite trinket of
these fashionables. I expose this foppery and vanity, as it
proves that there is as much vanity in one sex as the other
Finger rings are much worn by this class, and if they can meet
with a cheap signet ring, they are delighted. The wife of one of
this class of men told me, that her heart was nearly broken by
her husband's crank ways; that, at home, he was obliged to work
hard for nine shillings per week, and keep his family out of the
same. 'He can plough, ma'am, and delve, and do all kinds of work;
but he seems to think the government will make him a something
out of the common way.' She begged me to try and persuade him to
take a place where they might do well, and urged me to keep her
application a <i>secret</i>;' For I know, ma'am, he'd be the
death of me, if he knew I told you he was a poor man at home.' A
passenger on board ship, with a kind intention, gave this man his
cast-off ship clothing, and I believe he had received three
pounds, a few days before he left home, for some services at an
election; the fine clothes and money did him harm. It is almost
impossible to serve such a man if he has two shillings in his
pocket. The following morning I sent for him, told him I had a
situation that would suit him; he expressed himself thankful to
hear it&mdash;what was it?' An overseer at a bachelor's station;
you will have twenty-five pounds per annum, and full rations for
your wife and three children.' 'What shall I have to do?' 'Work;
there are sixty cows; two men are on the station&mdash;these you
must look after; and there is a small farm and garden as the
latter is near a township, the vegetables sell well; you are
allowed what you require for your own family; your principal work
will be in the garden and on the farm. You can plough, I should
say, judging from your looks; you have worked hard, and will find
this place easy.' 'I don't think I <i>would mind</i> taking a
situation as <i>head</i> superintendent, if you have one on your
books.' The settlers of this country are clever, shrewd men; they
seldom engage a newly arrived emigrant, for they require men of
colonial experience, and they generally take them from their
working overseers. 'So, you do not intend taking the situation I
have offered you?' '<i>Certainly not</i>.'"</p>
<p>A pauper who had been sent out never appeared in the office
until he had been three months in the colony; nor would he then,
but that he was struck off rations and turned out of the tents;
he then came to me, looking as idle, miserable, and wretched as
he <i>could make himself</i>.</p>
<p>"If you please ma'am, I want relief."</p>
<p>"What relief?"</p>
<p>"I am turned out, and I have four children, and nothing to
eat."</p>
<p>"Where are you going to stay?"</p>
<p>"With a shipmate."</p>
<p>"Come to me every morning at seven, and I will give you
rations for your family until you get work."</p>
<p>"Oh, ma'am, I can't get work!"</p>
<p>"I will find you work in two days."</p>
<p>"Thank you! Heaven bless you! but I am not well enough to
work. I was thinking of going to the hospital; but I am a little
afraid of the doctors here not understanding my complaint."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"It's called a <i>compleracation</i>."</p>
<p>"Dr. Harnett would cure you in a week."</p>
<p>"Would he though, really: you see, ma'am, I am very weak."</p>
<p>"Very?"</p>
<p>"Very; I require something strength'ing."</p>
<p>"Dr. H. has great faith in blisters; they are said to be the
best things in your complaint."</p>
<p>"Ah! but I could not bear them: you see, ma'am, they would
throw me into a fever that is the <i>worst</i> of my complaint,
what does me good one way, does me harm another."</p>
<p>"But with low diet there would be no fear of a fever, I will
write you a note to Dr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;."</p>
<p>"Why, no ma'am; I'll wait a day or two, thank you Are there
any parishes in this town?"</p>
<p>"Several."</p>
<p>"Will you please to tell me where the parish officer
lives?"</p>
<p>"There are no parish officers."</p>
<p>"Do <i>you</i> say so, ma'am?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;(A long
pause.) Where is there a vestry? for you see, ma'am, I'll never
be able to do without a little relief. Have you a benevolent
society here?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Do they give relief?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Will you please to give me an order?"</p>
<p>"You are not old enough by twenty years."</p>
<p>"Oh, ma'am, cannot you do something for me? Do you not know
any kind people who will help me with a trifle?"</p>
<p>After trying his patience for some time longer, I gave him two
days' provision for his family, and told him I would try and find
an <i>easy</i> place for him. A few days after this he came, and
renewed his demands in the following manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>"If you would only give me six shillings for a pair of
shoes."</p>
<p>"I will the day you are engaged. Nowhere is a little coffee
for you, and here is a needle, cotton, and thimble for your wife,
to mend your coat; you must come to me to-morrow, at nine, and I
will give you a waistcoat and shirt."</p>
<p>I then spoke to him about a shepherd's life; told him of the
flocks that belonged to men who came here without a sixpence. I
gave him a sheet of paper and pencil, and told him to go home and
calculate what he could save in five years. I was glad to observe
his step was quickened: the following morning he was punctual, I
had a new loaf, <i>quite hot</i>, some tea, sugar, a beef-steak,
a few pounds of potatoes these were in a basket.</p>
<p>"That's fine beef, John&mdash;it is for your breakfast."</p>
<p>"Do you say so, ma'am? Well, I am lucky."</p>
<p>"You must get a good place to-day. Now here is sixpence; go
and get shaved and your hair cut; and here is twopence&mdash;you
are obliged to buy water here; and, as soon as you come back, you
can take the basket, for I have something else for you yet."</p>
<p>In less than half an hour he returned, quite another man; and,
as I reminded him of my promise to give him the six shillings, he
went off in high spirits; and at half-past ten John Baldwin sat
in the office as a candidate for work. Though the improvement was
very great, still he had an idle look: I therefore sent to
Thorp's for one of their cheap neckerchiefs, and I must confess I
never laid out one shilling and threepence better. The office was
crowded when Number Five entered; in a loud voice, he talked of
the dreadful times; cheap labour; still he wanted a few
shepherds; but he was on the look out for a bargain&mdash;a cheap
bargain. I could perceive John view him attentively, and then
cast a wistful eye at the money that lay on the office desk. At
last, Number Five praised John for his apparent anxiety for work:
he blushed at the compliment; and, as I saw it was likely to be a
bargain, I went into the room&mdash;(it might be that I felt
guilty of using a little <i>starch</i>, or my dread of the
ridiculous, that made me retreat to where I could see and hear
without being observed). My success pleased me, for I was certain
Number Five would make John earn his wages and fit him for making
an honest livelihood in future; and I, at the same time, knew he
had half a lawyer to deal with. I returned to the office, entered
the agreement at &pound;18, per annum a man and his wife for
&pound;18.! I could see Number Five was delighted; so was I, for
methought what a change, what a blessing for his family, that he
has come to a country where there is no home for the idle: what
an advantage to his children! This man has been, at the time I
write, some months with his master, and if he turns out well, I
shall be bound to acknowledge that even grinders may do good. I
may also remark, with reference to these idlers, that when the
men in barracks were ordered by the emigration agent to work in
the domain, nine came to me very sick:&mdash;Would I give them a
ticket to Mr. McLean, to say they were unable to work? 'No; but I
will to the doctor.' They were not <i>quite ill enough</i> for
that, and therefore returned to their work."</p>

<br>
<p>If there be one point that we admire more than another in the
feeling that prompted Mrs. Chisholm to her Christian deeds, it is
that in which she desired the fulfillment of the law of nature
and the commands of God by promoting marriages, and the delight
expressed in seeing man blessed with an ample offspring, as holy
writ breathes forth a hope he will be. We feel the utmost
loathing of the brutal doctrines of heartless economists who in
their blasphemous language dare to term the "olive branches" sent
in the love of Providence to his creatures "incumbrances".</p>
<p>"I should not feel the interest I do in female emigration,"
says Mrs. Chisholm, "If I did not look beyond providing families
with female servants&mdash;If I did not know how much they are
required as wives, and how much moral good they may spread forth
in society as wives.</p>
<p>When I saw his Excellency regarding the establishment of 'The
Home', I observed that there were many hundreds more females in
Sydney than were registered, and that if they were protected on
their arrival, and sent into the interior, in six months many
would be married. His Excellency exclaimed with some astonishment
'Am I to find the settlers wives?'"</p>
<p>What his Excellency thought was not his duty Mrs. Chisholm
considered hers.</p>
<p>The following story is an amusing instance of a good hearted,
illiterate woman, in simplicity of mind speaking her private
thoughts; Mrs. Chisholm writes, "I had one very beautiful girl;
she could read and write well, was of an amiable temper, and
willing to take advice: I provided her with a situation; she was
returned to me solely on account of her good looks. I was at a
loss what to do with her: being afraid to allow her to go out for
exercise, I was obliged to limit her outgoings to attendance at
church on Sundays. She was the daughter of a lieutenant, who had
spent twenty-four years in the service of his country: and he
having a large family and limited means, sent one of his
treasures to seek an independent livelihood abroad. Providence
provided for her in an unexpected manner. A very respectable
woman, a settler's wife, waited on me for advice; she was one of
those sensible, shrewd women, that help to keep a home together.
She told me she had five boys and a girl, none of whom could read
or write, and that she wanted a teacher.</p>
<p>"My eldest boy, Jack, ma'am," said she, "is as fine a young
man as you would wish to see, only he is too wild: he is past
learning; but the others are willing enough." At this time, I had
three of these helpless creatures, just referred to, that I
wished to provide for; but I told the worthy woman &mdash;&mdash;
was so good tempered, that she would suit her best, if she did
not mind her being handsome.</p>
<p>"Has she any bounce about her?"</p>
<p>"None."</p>
<p>I went into the room with her; as her eye rested on
&mdash;&mdash;, there was a look of satisfaction, followed
directly by one of deep thought and reflection. There was
something so intelligent of a deep emotion in her mind flitted
across her countenance, that I became curious; she left the room;
and on returning to the office, said, "I'll see you again at five
o'clock, ma'am; but don't let the girl engage, any how: a thought
has come into my head I must <i>think over</i>." At five she
came. "Now, Mrs. Chisholm, I would like to tell you my plan Do
you see, says I, if any gal would keep a man at home, it would be
the creature I saw this morning: now says I, tho' Jack's not
taken to drink, yet he's uncommonly fond of company, and is for
going to every horse-race he hears of; and I expect, some time,
he'll make a very foolish match, wi' some one more ignorant than
he is: yet, ma'am, tho' he can neither read nor write, he's
uncommonly 'cute. Now, I think, if I take &mdash;&mdash; home,
she'll tempt him to stay at home; and then, when I see he's
taken, and his heart is touched, I shall call him on one
side&mdash;bounce a bit, and say 'I'll have no fine ladies living
wi' me.' This opposition will make him more determined; then, in
a day or two, I'll cry a bit about it he's kind-hearted, and
can't stand that: then he'll come coaxing me, and 111 consent,
and talk over the old man; and the clergyman shall settle every
thing, and it will be a good thing for us all, ma'am." I
consented to arrange with &mdash;&mdash;, who should be ready the
next day: she was engaged as a teacher for one year, salary
&pound;16.</p>
<p>Although Mrs. Chisholm received hundreds of applications for
wives, she would not make matches; but placed single girls as
servants or teachers with families, in districts where wives were
most wanted.</p>
<p>On one occasion, says Mrs. Chisholm, I received a letter from
a man who wanted a wife. I found he was well known to several
persons as a man of integrity. He stated it would be a serious
thing to visit Sydney for a wife: first, a loss of time; second,
money; and, after all, perhaps not be suited. His letter,
interested me; and I determined on trying to serve him; I give
his epistle verbatim et literatim, that the reader may judge for
himself:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Reverend madam, I heard you are the best to send to for a
servant, and I heard our police magistrate say, it was best to
leave all to you; and so I'll just do the same, as his honour
says it's the best. I had a wife once, and so she was too good
for me by the far, and it was God's will, ma'am; but I has a
child, ma'am, that I wouldn't see a straw touch for the world;
the boy's only four yeare old: and I has a snug fifty-acre farm
and a town 'lotment, and I has no debts in the world, and one
teem and four bullocks; and I'se ten head oh cattle, and a share
on eight hundred sheep, so I as a rite to a desent servant, that
can wash and cook and make the place decant; and I don't mind
what religion she bey, if she is sober and good, only I'se a
Protestant myself; and the boy I have, I promised the mother on
her death bed should be a Catholic, and I won't, anyhow, have any
interferance in this here matter. That I do like in writing
nothing else, I wouldn't, mam, on any account in the world, be
bound to marry; but I don't wish it altogether to be left out.
I'll ge her fourteen wages, and if she don't like me, and I don't
like her, I'll pay her back to Sydney. I want nothing in the
world but what is honest, so make the agrement as you like, and
I'll bide by it. I sends you all the papers, and you'l now I'm a
man wot's to be trusted. I sends you five pounds; she may get
wages first, for I know some of the gals, and the best on um, to,
are not heavy we boxes; and supposing anything should happen, I
would not like it to be said she come here in rags. I wants,
also, a man and his wife; he must be willing to learn to plough,
if he don't now how, and do a good fair day's work at anything:
his wife must be a milker, and ha dustrious woman; I'll give them
as much as they can eat and drink of tea and milk, and, whatever
wages you set my name down for, I'll be bound to pay it. With all
the honer in the world I'se bound to remain your servant till
death."</p>
<p>There was something, remarks Mrs. Chisholm, in the character
of this honest bushman, during his colonial residence, to admire;
he had gained his freedom, sent home money to his parents, and,
during a long and tedious illness of twenty months, had attended
his sick wife with patient care. Who would not get up an hour
earlier to serve such a man?&mdash;I did, for I knew that early
in the morning is the best time to choose a wife. I went first
into the governess-room&mdash;all asleep; I unlocked the
Home-door&mdash;some dressed, others half-dressed, some too very
cross: I have often remarked, that early in the day is the best
time to judge of a woman's temper; but I wish this to be kept a
secret. I remained half an hour in the Home; I then went through
the tents, could not suit myself, and returned. At the Home-door,
I found a girl at the wash-tub; she was at work with spirit; she
was rather good looking, very neat and tidy. I went into my
office, and ascertained that, on board ship, her character was
good. I desired the matron never to lose sight of her conduct,
and report the same to me. Day after day passed, and I was at
last fully determined to place her within reach, of my applicant
in the bush, that is, in a respectable family, in his near
neighbourhood; but I was able to arrange better, for I found
that, amongst the families wanting situations, there was one
related to her. I immediately engaged them as the bushman's
servants; they were a respectable couple; the man a very prudent
person. I told them to take the girl with them, and get her
service near them, and on no account to allow her to live with a
bachelor. I gave the girl three letters to respectable ladies,
and she was engaged by one the fourth day after her arrival at
&mdash;&mdash;. About a fortnight after, the bushman wrote to
thank me for sending him the married couple; and concluded by
saying, "With regard to that <i>other</i> matter, upon my word,
you have suited me exactly; and, as soon as our month is up, we
is to be married."</p>
<p>I received, says Mrs. Chisholm, forty-one applications of this
kind; but the above is the only girl I ever sent into the country
with a direct matrimonial intention.</p>
<p>The following is another specimen of an earnest appeal for a
better half.</p>
<p align="right">13th December, 1844.   </p>
<p>Dear Madam.&mdash;Matrimonial engagements, at all times,
require and demand mature deliberation, and should not needlessly
and thoughtlessly be entered upon, even with a prior knowledge of
the party&mdash;how much more then does it call for when coupled
with a perfect ignorance of the person and qualifications of your
future companion through life. Such then is the present case, and
I hesitate not, with the most perfect confidence, and a firm
reliance on your experience and discriminating judgment, to throw
my fate in your hands, and entreat your kind offices in the
obtaining for me a suitable companion for life, in other and
plainer words&mdash;"a wife". With reference to my character,
position, and prospects, I respectfully beg leave to refer you to
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, to whom I have the honour of being known,
and I trust they will prove satisfactory, If, dear madam, you
will be pleased so far to oblige me, I doubt not my happiness
will be accomplished, as there must be many worthy young women in
Sydney, in every way qualified to render connubial ties what it
is intended to be&mdash;a perfect blessing. The kind of person I
would most desire would be a young woman, between the years of 25
and 35, English, clean in person, neat in habit, mild in manners,
and an accomplished needlewoman, my late wife being a most
excellent sempstress. With renewed apologies, and a request that
you will favour me with an answer, I am, dear madam, your most
obedient servant,</p>
<p align="right">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;   </p>
<p>We will give one more instance, more especially as it
illustrates the indefatigable labours of the benevolent lady in
the wild bush of Australia.</p>
<p>When travelling with a large party of emigrants&mdash;while
they were sleeping in camp&mdash;as Mrs. Chisholm entirely
depended upon the settlers for food for her party, she was to be
seen at the dim break of day in her gig, driven by a prisoner
from Hyde Park Barracks, going about to collect from the settlers
food for the breakfasting of her party. On one occasion, just as
she came to a solitary part of the road, near a valley, she heard
a man shouting to her, "Stop, stop!" A stout, rough bushman,
clearing a few bushes at a leap, placed his hand on the horse's
head, and said, "Are you Mrs. Chisholm?" "Yes: what do you want?"
"Want&mdash;want&mdash;why, what every man like me wants when he
sees Mrs. Chisholm. Come now, do look up that hill, and see that
nice cottage and 40 acres under crop; and I have in it 20 hams
and flitches of bacon, and a chest of tea, and a bag of sugar;
the land is paid for, and the three cows; Oh, it would do you
good to see the cows;" and then pulling out a roll of papers,
continued, "See, what a character I have got from the magistrates
in charge of the district; and look here, ma'm, at this roll of
notes&mdash;these are the things to hasten the matter and get
over difficulties with the clergyman&mdash;come now, Mrs
Chisholm, do be a mother to me, and give me a wife; the smile of
a woman has never welcomed me home after a hard day's
work&mdash;you'll have pity on me&mdash;you don't mean to say no;
you'll never be so cruel as to say no? It makes a man's heart
light to look at your camp. Now, you don't mean to say you have
not got a nice girl from Tipperary. Never mind the breakfast; I
could keep the whole party for a week; and what peace of mind it
would be to you to know what a kind husband I shall make one of
your girls."</p>
<p>"It was upon the principle of family colonization," says Mrs.
Chisholm, "and actuated by such feelings, that I carried out my
matrimonial excursions in the Australian bush.</p>
<p>I, at times, took a number of single young females with me, in
company with emigrant families, but then I allowed no matrimonial
engagement to be made on the way, at the same time I took care to
place the young women in situations from which they might, with
that consideration due to the feelings of woman, enter with
propriety and respectability into the matrimonial state."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>
<p align="center"><b>CONVICTS BLESS GOD THEIR CHILDREN ARE NOT IN

WIVES&mdash;HOSPITALITY&mdash;MORAL SENSIBILITY&mdash;A REFORMED
LONDON PICKPOCKET&mdash;GOD'S POLICE&mdash;EARL GREY'S CONSENT,
AND CAPTAIN CHISHOLM'S BENEVOLENCE&mdash;LAND
TICKETS&mdash;DECENCY IN INTERMENTS&mdash;"UNFORTUNATES."</b></p>
<br>
<p>Among the people in Mrs. Chisholm's field of labour were many
who had been convicts, termed in the colonies "emancipists", one
writer in speaking of this class says, "Nothing struck me more in
the colony than the good behaviour of men who had been convicts;
and I was continually inclined to ask 'Why have these men been
transported?'" The emancipists were often to be met with in the
bush, living in a horrible state of bachelorism, having
sufficient means to support their wives and families who were,
most probably, either in abject poverty or burdens on their
parishes in England. Others again were living with women and
having families while their wives were at home, but had no means
of reaching those to whom, at the altar of God, they had plighted
their troth.</p>
<p>In a letter on "Emigration and Transportation relatively
considered", by Mrs. Chisholm, addressed to earl Grey, we get a
vivid picture of the emancipist.</p>
<p>"Often, my lord, have I heard the emancipist, at family
prayer, return thanks to Almighty God that his children were not
in a country where they might be tempted by hunger to perpetrate
crime.</p>
<p>In all the systems, and every system which has hitherto been
tried, I do not, as far as my observation has gone, see much to
approve; on the whole, I am bound to say, that the ease with
which men can earn a living honestly, has done more for the
reformation of the prisoner than any other observable cause. One
of the most demoralizing evils of the old system, has been the
separation of men from all domestic influence&mdash;rending for
ever asunder the links of nature. The spirit of British justice
never contemplated to sever for ever those whom "God had joined
together;" nor is it in accordance with the dictates of religion
and pure morality, that such a state of things should exist, as
to doom men to be for years incarcerated together by hundreds,
like a menagerie of wild beasts, or to live a solitary hopeless
life in the bush; but so it is, thousands upon thousands are thus
victimized, and destined to undergo all the frightful and
deteriorating effects of this more than savage life.</p>
<p>Painful experience then has, by this time, exemplified to Her
Majesty's Government the frightful consequences attending the
aggregation of so many men in a state of close and galling
bondage in Norfolk Island, Port Arthur, &amp;c. If those unhappy
victims to a principle promulgated but too successfully by a
modern popular author, and who, I hesitate not to say,
iniquitously tried to depreciate and thwart the decrees of
Providence in the propagation of the human race, be so far sunk
in the scale of humanity as to give but little prospect of their
reformation; yet I have every reason to hope, that their truly
lamentable condition may excite your lordship's commiseration,
and dispose you to co-operate with those good Christians and
philanthropists who in all faith believe that while there is hope
of heaven, there is hope on earth; so that those who have
escaped&mdash;and I am happy to think, vast numbers have
escaped&mdash;this 'evil communication', and have gained through
the force of an innate virtue, and the interposition of a
merciful Providence, a respectable position in the ranks of
social life; may receive from the hands of Her Majesty's
Government that moral consideration, that degree of justice,
which their domestic wrongs require.</p>
<p>No individual, perhaps, has had so many opportunities as I
have had of becoming acquainted with the people of New South
Wales. Wandering for hundreds of miles in search of suitable
homes and eligible employment for the emigrant families and
ticket-of-leave men, I had been accustomed at nightfall to find
shelter at the nearest hut; as one of the family I have shared in
the hospitality of all classes, whether rich or poor;
consequently, I have had opportunities of gaining an intimate
knowledge of the peculiarities and feelings of the people, and
these justify what might otherwise appear uncalled for my
recording here my humble testimony to the sterling worth and
exemplary conduct, as a body, of the emancipists of New South
Wales. At a time when slander outruns truth and charity, as
regards the moral character of that people, I must honestly tell
your lordship, that as parents, their extreme&mdash;nay, I must
call it, nervous anxiety, regarding the moral and religious
welfare of their children;&mdash;the efforts they make to educate
them; the miles they travel to attend a place of worship on the
Sabbath;&mdash;their deep sympathy for the
unfortunate;&mdash;their Christian liberality and
charity;&mdash;their open-hearted hospitality, have endeared
numbers of them to my remembrance. Amongst this class it may be
truly said, 'the schoolmaster is abroad.' I only wish that the
noble lord who has immortalized this saying, had the domestic
opportunities I have had of witnessing the efforts made by this
class. When engaged at one time in providing for some emigrant
families in the interior, I was accommodated at a farm-house,
where both the heads of the family happened to have been sent out
by Her Majesty's government; neither could read or write. Here I
found a man engaged as teacher; certainly not the person you
would wish to see trusted with the tuition of a promising young
family of boys and girls. Their parents, a few weeks previous to
my seeing them, had sent a few bushels of wheat to market, just
to find them tea and sugar, until they could go to Sydney to sell
their regular crop; they sold to the amount of 35s.; sixteen
shillings of this sum were expended on books and stationery for
their children. The books were handed to me by the mother, who
remarked, "they cost a good bit, but we could not do better we
our money." One of the books was the life of &mdash;&mdash;; the
hero of this tale distinguished himself by his prodigies of
adroit exploits in Newgate and its environs, a wild story of
facts and fiction. I remarked that I had been informed it was a
dangerous book; that it made what was bad look like good; was
particularly enticing to youths of a certain turn of mind. "Now
do you say so? How glad Jack will be you called&mdash;what a
Providence!" and before I could even be aware of her intention,
it was in flames on their hearth-stone. It never entered into her
mind it could be exchanged, re-sold; that my opinion might be
wrong; but, at the mere mention of apprehended danger, the book
was destroyed. It was dashed into the fire, as if a venomous
reptile had clung to a part of her garments. Is not this, my
lord, a bright example for imitation? I knew an emancipist father
refuse his daughter in marriage to a respectable emigrant, until
he had paid some debts he had contracted before he emigrated; he
was willing to pay the sum out of the portion he intended for his
daughter, remarking, "Their prosperity would be greater, when no
man could say they had wronged him." This scrupulous regard for
property was entertained by a man who was once a notorious London
pick-pocket. A pick-pocket! yes, we must not scorn or think
lightly of those who have returned from the path of evil to the
course of rectitude. I crave your lordship's patience a little
longer; for while I love to linger on those little domestic
incidents&mdash;those traits and fruits of returning virtue, and
like to point them out to others as matters deserving their pious
contemplation, I wish to bring to your lordship's notice one of
those facts which ought to appear to the moralist and
philanthropist, as one of paramount interest. Shortly before I
left Sydney, the father of a large family came a journey of
upwards of a hundred miles to see me. The object of his mission
was a serious one. If, my lord, you are pressed for time, lay
down this letter, for the prayer of his request deserves a
tranquil moment; one that I would like you to think about, when,
having for a time bid adieu to the cares of State, you seek the
solace of domestic society; his prayer is one that I would like
to cling about your heart, as one of your own household
honey-suckles. It must not meet you at your office; but you must
take it with you wherever you go. I would fain obtain for it a
clinging place in your recollection, that when you think of your
own dear ties, the wish of the emancipist father should present
itself to your remembrance. He sought a wife for his son! a girl
of good fame! "If," said he, "you could only get me a good girl;
if I could see my son married to a good woman, then I should die
in peace."</p>
<p>You have heard enough, my lord, of the horrors that have
resulted from the Penal system; a system which has doomed
thousands and tens of thousands to the demoralizing state of
bachelorism. Calmly consider the evil which has thus been
created, and in common justice to the virtuous part of the
community there, remedy it, by giving a due encouragement to a
respectable system of female emigration.</p>
<p>They are a class of men sensitively alive to virtuous
marriages in their families, for no one more fully appreciates
virtue than the reformed, * * If Her Majesty's government be
really desirous of seeing a well conducted community spring up in
these colonies, the social wants of the people must be
considered. If the paternal government wish to entitle itself to
that honoured appellation, it must look to the materials it may
send as a nucleus for the formation of a good and a great people,
For all the clergy you can dispatch, all the schoolmasters you
can appoint, all the churches you can build, and all the books
you can export, will never do much good, without "God's
police"&mdash;wives and little children&mdash;good and virtuous
women.</p>
<p>We may here state that, following up this public letter to
earl Grey, by repeated personal applications at Downing street,
and presenting a list of women, the wives of convicts holding
tickets of leave in New South Wales, desirous of joining their
husbands, the government yielded. Captain Chisholm becoming
individually responsible for expenses incurred by them. The poor
people came, many from Ireland, to Woolwich to be shipped off in
the female convict ship, they were there met by the kind and
warm-hearted lady and her husband&mdash;their necessities
supplied, and by the generosity of Mr. Silver and Mr. Robert
Brooks, of Cornhill, clothed. Arrangements were made for their
reception in Sydney, and the inhabitants there viewed the measure
as one beneficial to morality, consistent with humanity, and the
most sure way of making steady, virtuous, and devoted citizens of
the men.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Chisholm was on her journeys on humanity's behalf,
she discovered that many poor people buried the money they had
saved as a mode of security. She therefore, through the press,
proposed that the colonial government should issue land tickets
representative of the value of five shillings and a pound, that
these should be offered to working men in exchange for their then
useless money. That the funds accumulated from this source should
be applied to assist the emigration of industrious people
desirous of settling in the colony, and that the tickets be
received by the government in payment for land. The Sydney papers
do not state whether this excellent suggestion was ever carried
into effect. But we suspect that it was not from the contracted
views generally taken of liberal propositions by governing
bodies.</p>
<p>It was the custom at Sydney to convey the bodies of the poor
to the cemetery in a common rubbish cart. The lively feeling of
respect to God's creatures, whether rich or poor, dead or living,
with which Mrs. Chisholm is endowed was shocked at the sight, and
making an earnest appeal to the public to obliterate such a foul
stain on their civilization, the proposition was warmly taken up,
the worthy bishop of Australia heading a subscription list. A
horse, harness, hearse, and suitable appointments were procured,
and for about four shillings was ready with a driver to make the
last act of the living to the dead consistent with the solemnity
of the awful occasion. It is singular from people considering
what is everybody's business is nobody's, how they will allow the
best feelings of human nature to slumber torpidly in their
bosoms.</p>
<p>There is one subject it would be wrong to pass over in
recounting the singular toils of this lady, because it is ever
calling for the sympathy and commiseration of the Christian mind,
and its duty exemplified in an act of our Redeemer, but is
shunned by the daughters of luxury, ease, and virtue. It must be
acknowledged there is great merit in reclaiming sinners wandering
from the paths of righteousness and by making them sensible of
their crime, teaching them to seek forgiveness of their errors at
the throne of divine grace It was to be expected from our
previous details of Sydney society that the streets of that place
would be crowded with "unfortunate" females. Women who have once
swerved from virtue's path are abhorred and repulsed by their own
sex, while man, by whom they were tempted and corrupted, is ever
ready to denounce and condemn them, Despised by society, the
agonies of the mind are sought to be alleviated by plunging
deeper into vice,&mdash;dissipation produces disease, she falls
ere her prime&mdash;the grave offering repose to the body, but
discovering the doom of the soul.</p>
<p>To bring to a sense of repentance, to draw from the showy path
of sin such lost creatures is surely a work of true Christian
piety, meriting the sincerest approbation of the virtuous. To
this duty did Mrs. Chisholm, in the large benevolence of her
heart, apply herself, and the result is one so cheering in its
consummation as to stand a noble precedent for others to attempt
a similar work of mercy. Seventy-six of these women were
reclaimed, and only seven returned to a career of infamy.</p>

<p align="center"><b>SOCIAL ARRANGEMENTS&mdash;SMALL FARMS
SUCCESSFUL&mdash;GOVERNMENT SUCCUMB&mdash;BUSH
PARTNERSHIPS&mdash;SYDNEY YEOMEN&mdash;JOURNEY INTO THE
BUSH&mdash;TESTIMONIAL TO MRS. CHISHOLM&mdash;DEPARTURE FOR
ENGLAND.</b></p>
<br>
<p>To take a broad view of mankind at the present day it will be
apparent to the thinking mind that forms of government are not
considered so important as social improvement. Various are the
schemes of the lovers of our species to alleviate the miseries
that have grown up in the progress of civilization, time only
will show which among the crude propositions shall receive the
stamp of truth. The under current that agitates society in every
quarter of the earth and engages the attention of philosophers is
the question of the distribution of the land. Without being
guided by either political or social ideas, but from observing
the workings of the mind as presented for observation by the
various and numerous classes that passed under the searching
review of Mrs. Chisholm, she came to the conclusion "that in
ninety nine cases out of a hundred, emigrants emigrate in order
<small>TO LIVE AND HAVE LAND.</small></p>
<p>It appears that land could only be purchased in large
quantities and at a fixed price. The consequence of this was that
persons with numerous children and moderate capital, could
neither get employment from having large families nor could they
purchase small farms to subsist comfortably upon by means of
their labour.</p>
<p>The government at home thought that as the system of
competition and legal expenses effectually prevented small farms
in England, and believing the system worked well here, some such
scheme as making capitalists the only proprietors of land, and
labourers never able to rise from the sphere in which they
commenced life, they were adapting to an infant colony those
principles by which England has attained its renowned character
for wealth and commerce, and therefore benefiting it in a wise
and judicious manner.</p>
<p>It seems the government was mistaken and misled by interested
mischievous theorists, who with pen and ink drew beautiful plans,
but which in practice were found impracticable.</p>
<p>The squatters who proceed into the solitary wilds of
unexplored parts and are the pioneers of colonization, were too
powerful, they banded together and the government thought it
prudent even to grant them more than they demanded. Another large
party united and took possession of land near to Port Philip and
were too strong for the colonial force to oppose.</p>
<p>The humble and industrious emigrants with large families were
exactly the parties that would enlist the energy of Mrs. Chisholm
in their behalf. Seeing the great difficulty of obtaining land by
purchase she procured the consent of some large proprietors to
grant on easy terms farms of fifteen, twenty, and forty acres; on
these she planted worthy families, their industry and skill was
remunerative, they throve excellently, and not only did their
families have abundance of every requisite of life but they saved
money.</p>
<p>After having proved by actual experiment, that labouring men
with large families, rejected on that account by the squatters as
servants, could support themselves and become independent by
being placed upon from ten to twenty acres of good land; Mrs.
Chisholm ardently followed up her representations in favour of
this class, she had the gratification of seeing, under the
government of Sir George Gipps, land put up for sale in lots of
fifty acres.</p>
<p>The next work that falls under our notice which this lady
undertook, for one of the most surprising traits of her character
is the fertility of beneficial and practical ideas, was that of
Bush Partnerships; a kind of co-operative association of two or
more individuals who by joint labour created capital, brought
farms into a remunerative state and then separated. After
recommending great circumspection in the choice of associates,
Mrs. Chisholm says, "What I would particularly recommend to new
settlers is '<i>Bush Partnership</i>'&mdash;Let two friends or
neighbours agree to work together, until three acres are cropped,
dividing the work, the expense, and the produce&mdash;this
partnership will grow apace; I have made numerous bush agreements
of this kind. One settler's wife was an excellent milker; her
next-door neighbour could not manage a cow. An agreement was
made, much to the advantage of both.&mdash;Settler A. was to bail
up and milk B's cows&mdash;while B., in return, agreed to give
one hour's instruction, daily, in reading and writing to A's
children.</p>
<p>C. was an excellent gardener, but not equal to D. at sawing; D
agreed to take C's place at the saw, while he worked in D's
garden. A., B., C., D. were neighbours. A. had a large family,
but little money&mdash;they agreed to buy a bullock and
water-cart for their domestic use&mdash;B., C., D. found the
money, A. agreeing that his son should take charge of the
bullock, and go for the water for twelve months, as his amount of
the contribution. At the close of the year, B., C., D. had
horses; the bullock and dray were valued; they drew lots who
should take it at the price named; it was A's draw; but he had no
money; B., C., D. were glad to agree that A's son should give
them labour as payment. I was present the day the son had paid
the last day's labour. B., C., D. said, 'it has done us all good,
and A. has behaved so punctually, the boy has worked so
well&mdash;never been any excuse;'&mdash;the four farmers talked
the matter over, shook hands, wished the boy luck, and the same
evening entered into a bush agreement respecting the joint
management of their cows."</p>
<p>The last great labour of Mrs. Chisholm in the colonies was one
of a most arduous nature, from which many a bold hearted and
muscular framed man would have shrunk, it was to collect
"Voluntary Information from the People of New South Wales;" to
make known, as Mrs. Chisholm writes, to a British public the
resources of the Australian colonies; to furnish the labourer,
the mechanic, and the capitalist, with information that can be
depended upon; to point out obstructions to emigration which
ought to be removed; and to expose evils which ought to be
eradicated. * * * To supply flock masters with shepherds is a
good work! To supply those shepherds with wives is a better!! To
find employment for families that will enable them to rear a
well-fed peasantry is a God-like undertaking.</p>
<p>Australia can boast of her high-spirited sons&mdash;her
virtuous daughters&mdash;her sunny sky&mdash;her rich
pastures&mdash;her ships laden with wool&mdash;her cattle wild
and countless on her mountains&mdash;her sheep crowding her
hills, and seeking the shelter of her vallies; she can grow her
own sugar&mdash;make her own wine&mdash;press her own
oil&mdash;spin her own cotton&mdash;weave her own wool&mdash;grow
her own corn&mdash;but, until Australia can prove that she can be
peopled by her own children where God's blessings are not
considered 'encumbrances', she will never be able to maintain a
proud position or be competent to defend the noble harbours which
Providence has given her harbours to be defended by her sons,
who, at the call of Old England, would issue forth, and by their
gallant aid and meritorious deeds do honour to the race from
whence they sprang."</p>
<p>The evil most prominent in this lady's idea was the horrible
disparity of sexes, causing the colony to rely on emigration for
a supply of inhabitants, and that too in a country where industry
defies want, and the honourable pride of a numerous family, free
from poverty and temptation, could be indulged in man's heart
teeming with thankfulness for such a natural and divine
blessing.</p>
<p>The information collected was "Brief Biographies" of settlers
and servants, taken down in their own words, in answer to a list
of printed questions.</p>
<p>In carrying out this plan, Mrs. Chisholm travelled into the
Bush and collected upwards of six-hundred biographies, as a fair
example of the working classes. These journeys she accomplished
in a covered spring van, travelling from farm to farm, and from
station to station; one night sleeping at a wealthy squatter's
residence, the next at a humble settler's cottage, welcomed and
known to all. She was accompanied by her husband, who joined her
from India in 1845. In one of her printed letters to the public,
she states, "the facts in question were collected by me some
months previous to my leaving the colony, by visiting their farms
and homesteads; sometimes taking down their statements in their
own dwellings, sometimes on the road side, and sometimes in the
ploughed field, having the plough as my table. I was indeed so
well known to the people, and as they knew my motive was to
convey faithful information to their relatives, friends, and
countrymen at home&mdash;they invariably related to me their
circumstances with the greatest readiness and cheerfulness. I
have in my possession a large mass of these facts, which I have
named 'The Voluntary Information of the People of New South
Wales'; and they present a fair average of the condition of the
working classes there. My object now in giving some of them
publicity is the desire I have of their being made the basis for
the formation of a Family Colonization Loan Society."</p>
<p>One small tract, containing a few statements, was published in
Sydney, and another in London, in 1848: many hundreds, of a very
interesting description, remain in manuscript.</p>
<p>In February, 1846, a public meeting was held at Sydney, for
the purpose of taking into consideration the presenting to Mrs.
Chisholm, then on the eve of her departure for England, a
testimonial of the estimation in which her labours on behalf of
the emigrant population were viewed by the colonists. Some idea
may be formed of the respect felt for the admirable lady, and
acknowledgement of her public services, when eight members of the
Legislative Council, the Mayor of Sydney, the High Sheriff,
thirteen Magistrates, and many leading merchants formed
themselves into a committee to carry the wishes of the meeting
into effect. The amount of each subscription was limited.</p>
<p>In a very short time 150 guineas were raised, and presented to
her with the following address:</p>
<p>"We, the undersigned members of council, magistrates,
landholders, merchants, and others, inhabitants of New South
Wales, beg to offer you, on the occasion of your departure from
this colony, the expression of our thanks for your active and
zealous exertions on behalf of the emigrant population during the
last seven years.</p>
<p>"We feel assured that the extraordinary efforts which you have
made have been dictated by a spirit of the most enlightened
benevolence. <i>In the establishment of an Emigrant's Home</i> in
Sydney, and in procuring the advantageous <i>settlement</i> of
great numbers of the <i>emigrant population in the interior, as
servants, and occupants of small farms</i>, your exertions have
proved of signal advantage to the community.</p>
<p>"In the large collection of <i>statistical facts and
'voluntary information</i>' which you have derived from the
labouring classes, you have accumulated materials for
establishing the great advantages which New South Wales possesses
as a favourable field for the emigration of British
Settlers."</p>
<p>Mrs. Chisholm accepted the testimonial, in order to expend it
in further promoting emigration, in restoring wives to husbands,
and children to parents. In the course of her answer, she said
"<i>It is my intention, if supported by your co-operation, to
attempt more than I have hitherto performed</i>."</p>
<p>She left Australia in 1846, bearing with her the warm prayers
of the working colonists, whose confidence and gratitude, both
bond and free, she had thoroughly secured, charged with the
self-imposed mission of representing in England the claims of
those powerless classes who have neither honour nor pensions to
bestow on their advocates.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>
<p align="center"><b>OPENS AN OFFICE IN ENGLAND&mdash;THE
GOVERNOR ORDERS CHILDREN OF EMIGRANTS TO BE SENT OUT&mdash;EARL
GREY DESIRES MRS. CHISHOLM's OPINION&mdash;SUMMONED BEFORE A
COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS&mdash;SECURITY IN TRANSMITTING
MONEY&mdash;FAMILY COLONIZATION LOAN SOCIETY&mdash;A, B, C, OF
COLONIZATION.</b></p>
<br>
<p>Faithfully and earnestly has Mrs. Chisholm, in this country,
performed her promise to the people of Sydney.</p>
<p>Immediately upon her arrival, her private residence was thrown
open to aid persons desirous of emigrating, she communicated with
the friends of settlers, gave gratuitous and friendly advice to
others, and personally superintended the shipment of the
inexperienced. Not only did her noble husband become responsible
for many expenses, but by the joint exertions of this exemplary
man and woman the starving were fed and the naked clad. Such was
the tax on their moderate income that postages alone amounted to
upwards of &pound;1. in a week. With the assistance of their
young family and incessant labour of both captain Chisholm and
his wife, the clerical duties became more than they could
accomplish, which compelled them to engage assistance in this
department. All these works of humanity were performed at a
severe sacrifice to their limited means, still they looked at the
holy work as far surpassing any private consideration, and
thought but of the good they were bestowing on their fellow
mortals.</p>
<p>They have made a still greater sacrifice of personal feeling,
captain Chisholm having proceeded in 1851 to the Australian
colonies with the view of promoting the re-union of separated
members of families, while Mrs. Chisholm for the present remains
in England to carry on her plan of Family Colonization.</p>
<p>Immediately following the departure of these missionaries of
mercy, we find in a "blue book" that the governor of Sydney, Sir
George Gipps, wrote to Mr. Secretary Gladstone in England, that
it having been represented to him "by Mrs. Chisholm, a lady who
has on many occasions made herself useful to this government in
matters connected with the disposal of emigrants, that during the
course of great emigration many children had been left behind in
consequence of the inability of their parents to pay * * for the
passage of each child." His excellency then gave a list of
children, and stated that he had issued an order for their
emigration at the public expense. To this both the Government
Emigration Commissioners and lord Grey gave their cordial
approval.</p>
<p>The correspondence between the governor and the government was
sent from Downing Street to Mrs. Chisholm with a request to "have
the kindness to favour him (earl Grey) with your opinions as to
the feasibility of the suggestions there offered, together with
any remarks which your knowledge and experience in these matters
may enable you to communicate."</p>
<p>Mrs. Chisholm sent a noble reply, pleading for families to be
sent entire, showing the iniquity of making children a bar to
emigration, and that it became "the duty of the state to throw
protection around the child." That the clause in which "couples
who have no children" being considered most eligible, was
"fraught with most fatal consequences;" throwing a horrible
temptation in the way of undisciplined minds. That she had "heard
the iniquitous warning coolly given, 'Remember, you must have no
children when you are with me; that breaks our agreement.' And
this alone, and paramount to all other considerations, determined
me to locate families."</p>
<p>Mrs. Chisholm issued the pamphlet before referred to,
addressed to earl Grey, and his lordship honoured her with an
interview, paying marked attention to her representations of the
wants of the colonies. The Government Emigration Commissioners,
too, twice had the advantage of receiving her opinion,
<i>viv&acirc; voce</i>. She was next summoned before a committee
of the House of Lords, referring to which, earl Grey in a
dispatch to the now governor, Sir C. A. Fitzroy, says he begs to
inform him that in Mrs. Chisholm's evidence she had mentioned
"the want of proper accommodation for the reception and
protection of young women immediately on their landing from
emigrant ships. This is a point to which I would request your
early attention, and I am sure I need not impress upon you the
importance," &amp;c.</p>
<p>It is pleasing thus to record the attention paid by a powerful
aristocratic government to the voice of a sincere uninfluential
woman when pleading in the cause of humanity.</p>
<p>The wives and families of convicts were the next objects on
which Mrs. Chisholm's energy prevailed. An account of their
shipment we have detailed in another page.</p>
<p>Among the many evils Mrs. Chisholm promised the poor of Sydney
she would endeavour to rectify, was that of the insecurity of the
transmission of money to friends in England. Many sums were sent
to pay the passages of the aged and children who had been left
behind, which money frequently never reached its destination or
fell into the hands of persons by whom it was misapplied.</p>
<p>On July 29th, 1847, Earl Grey sent a dispatch to the governor,
Sir C. A. Fitzroy, commencing thus, "Sir, it has been intimated
to me by Mrs Chisholm, of whose benevolent exertions you are, no
doubt, well aware, that there are many of the settlers in New
South Wales who, having prospered in the colony, are exceedingly
desirous of applying a part of their savings in assisting their
friends and relations, whom they have left in this country, to
join them in the colony, and share in the advantages which they
themselves enjoy, but who are prevented from sending by the
difficulty of securing the safe remittance of the necessary
funds, and their application to the intended purpose.</p>
<p>I consider it of the greatest possible importance to adopt
means for obviating that difficulty, and for affording the utmost
practicable facility to those who, having already emigrated, wish
to de, vote a part of their earnings to so commendable a
purpose." His lordship then details a plan&mdash;and thus was
another of the labours of Mrs. Chisholm triumphant.</p>
<p>Indefatigable in her zeal on the subject of emigration, Mrs.
Chisholm, on one occasion, when going to the government
emigration office, was detained among the crowd of persons
desirous of emigrating, and hearing their plaints of the
necessity of lies to attain their object by denying their having
families, and regret on a separation from the objects of their
affectionate love, resolved from that moment on the formation of
a <small>FAMILY COLONIZATION LOAN SOCIETY</small>, the leading
principles of which are repudiatory of government or parochial
assistance. The class of persons generally who desire to emigrate
are those who having industry and skill, desire a larger and more
remunerative field for their powers than they find in their
native country, and, impressed with that idea, they are willing
to make personal sacrifices to obtain their object, while being
thus worthy minded, they feel pain in separating themselves from
those parental ties which exist in the bosoms of the good
disposed.</p>
<p>The founder of this new system of emigration proposes that a
fund shall be created by the savings of the parties desirous of
going abroad, of not less than two-thirds of the passage money;
that they shall meet in groups; learn each others' character;
become friends; and be mutually bound to aid in causing to be
refunded the remainder of the expense when at their destination,
within a certain time; that this money, as paid, shall aid others
to go out, and subscriptions from the benevolent be applied to
the same purpose.</p>
<p>Robert Lowe, Esq., member of the legislative council of New
South Wales, in a speech delivered in London, June 1st, 1850,
says, "there is a very benevolent and amiable lady, Mrs.
Chisholm, to whose exertions too much praise cannot be given, who
is now sending emigrants out at &pound;12, but the government
price is &pound;18." Thus then it seems there is not only more
independence, security, and family ties preserved, but that it is
a cheaper mode.</p>
<p>The arrangements made on board of ship are such as to form a
perfect security to children and young females. In fact, nothing
can be more consonant with good will, kindness and watchfulness,
than the plan laid down. The responsibility on fathers and
families is of such a moral nature that they must feel proud of
the trust, and none dare abuse it. The gratifying feeling that
cheers this lady on in the work of humanity is that of having
entire families, bound together by affection, seeking a new home,
and supporting each other in their trials and labours; thus a
dear parent, perhaps seventy or eighty years of age, goes abroad
with her children or grandchildren and shares their fortunes
instead of being left a solitary deserted being relying on the
frigid support of poor rates, and the chilling attendance of
hirelings in a workhouse. So truly noble is this plan that it
ranks in its committee lord Ashley, M. P., the right honourable
Sydney Herbert, M. P., the hon. Vernon Smith, M. P., John Tidd
Pratt, Esq., F. G. Neison, Esq., M. Monsell, Esq., M. P., Wyndham
Harding Esq., while Captain Chisholm takes the unpaid and arduous
duty of hon. Secretary.</p>
<p>In 1850, Mrs. Chisholm published her celebrated pamphlet,
called "the ABC of Colonization", in which she denounces the
existing plans of emigration. There is a genuine womanly feeling
throughout, and such a spirited assertion of the dignity of
womanhood, and love for the aged and young, that we cannot
forbear a few short extracts; she says, "I should like every one
to feel that under that revered name (Queen Victoria) it mattered
not, when they made application for a passage, what country they
came from, so that they were British subjects&mdash;what creed
they professed, so that they were loyal and peaceable men. I hold
it to be derogatory to the high and moral feeling of Englishmen,
that under the insignia of the royal arms of England, modest
matrons should be asked the question 'Whether any increase to the
family is expected, and when? I consider it a gross outrage to
humanity&mdash;a violent rending of the tenderest ties of nature,
and injurious to morality, that heads of families above forty
years of age, and those who have a certain number of children
under ten years of age, should be excluded from the advantages
and rights of emigration&mdash;that under other rules children
beyond a certain number should be taxed &pound;7. each on account
of passage money that again, single men passed the age of
thirty-five should not be considered eligible, and that the
'candidates most acceptable are young married couples without
children.' These, indeed, are evils, trials, temptations, and
stumbling blocks, thrown in the way of weak human nature, which
ought not to be; humanity should forbid it, and religion ought to
raise her voice against it; the aged, if able to go, should not
be left to pass the remainder of their days round a lonely and
cheerless hearth, or to find their way to the workhouse. * *
*</p>
<p>"The emigrants sent by the government assemble at Deptford or
some other port: not two families know each other, or perchance
until their meeting at the depot had ever seen one another
before: young females find themselves there as perfect strangers.
But what scenes take place before they have got thus far; what
conflicts of nature are endured 'ere they leave their homes; what
harrowing scenes arise out of the taxation clause; at times young
children may be seen handed over to the care of a grandfather, an
aunt, or a cousin, or as one poor man in Australia said to me,
'my wife was obliged to take the child from her breast by the
side of the ship, and hand it to a friend.' Others, on account of
having just passed the prime of life, are necessitated to remain
behind. What wailings in the cottage! What sad farewells outside
the village! How nature will then exclaim, 'Never see that dear
face more&mdash;never look at that venerated parent again', now
sunk in agony in the darkest corner of his dreary habitation.
This is not a piece of romance, but one of the scenes of real
life. Which are most to be felt for, the intended emigrant or the
desolate being left behind? These heart-burnings of nature are
not extinguished here; the same feeling which a benign
Providence, for the wisest of designs, has implanted in the human
heart, keeps the flame alive in the distant colonies; the child
longs for the parent&mdash;the father or the disconsolate mother
sighs for the offspring. I cannot tell how often I have been
entreated by sons and daughters in New South Wales to do all I
could to see their parents sent to them, or the numerous
applications I have had made to me by parents to forward to them
their children. These appeals follow me to this country. * *
*</p>
<p>"There are many evils that will doubtless present themselves
to every reflecting mind attending our present mode of filling
ships, but may we not hope that we shall go on suggesting and
improving until our young women can be sent into a ship with the
same confidence with which females now enter our trains and mail
coaches; something more humanizing is required than the present
mode; something that will bring all our social and religious
feelings to bear upon one common object."</p>
<p>To those horrible evils, and disregard of our natural ties,
has Mrs. Chisholm,by her plans, presented a mode of redress.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>
<p align="center"><b>MRS. CHISHOLM&mdash;PHRENOLOGICAL
DEVELOPEMENT OF HER HEAD&mdash;PHILANTHROPY A LADY FRANKING
LETTERS&mdash;TESTIMONIES TO MRS.
CHISHOLM&mdash;CONCLUSION.</b></p>
<br>
<p>Before concluding, it may be thought in our memoirs of the
labours of this good and extraordinary woman that we should give
some idea of her personal appearance.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chisholm is tall, embonpoint, and as the governor says,
"stately in her bearing;" frank, easy, and lady-like in her
manners; her mouth expresses the firmness and decision of her
character; her eyes are grey, penetrating in their glance; and
her countenance beaming with kindness, which at once causes
confidence in her intentions; a certain calmness and earnestness
rest on her features, which is aroused into powerful expression
as, the subject of her discourse is that of advice, affection, or
contempt; her voice is musical, without the slightest
provincialism, she speaks with fluency and appropriateness of
phraseology, and, as occasion calls forth, can be affecting,
sarcastic, or witty. In the midst of a vast correspondence and
personal superintendence of business details, certain periods are
sacredly assigned to domestic duties.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chisholm has six children living, the three eldest of
whom have aided in the labours of carrying into effect the
gratuitous and philanthropic plans of emigration as propounded in
the Family Colonization Society, and it is truly gratifying to
see the species of adoration and love with which they look upon
their amiable parents. Piety, in deeds as well as words,
matrimonial, filial, and paternal love knit together, and form
one of the happiest of happy family circles.</p>
<p>The head of Mrs. Chisholm is one which a phrenologist
contemplates with immense interest Unknown to De Ville, she was
urged to present herself to him, and not enter into conversation,
when that celebrated manipulator thus declares his opinion of the
organization that appeared to him: "This lady's memory is rather
extraordinary; there are very few persons who possess so strong
an one. Few people have greater power in the acquirement of
languages. If she had attempted improvisation, she would have
excelled in it; there are few organizations with more power for
it. Has a <i>very high</i> sense of justice, but she must take of
it. If offended her expressions will be strong.</p>
<p>Attachments and friendships few, and very strong. Diffident
among strangers, but cheerful in society. It is not often a lady
takes to mathematics, but this individual would not find it
difficult. If she would take up poetry she would do well at it.
With theology and sacred history she should be well acquainted:
has a high sense of religion.</p>
<p>The organization is not confined to a single thing, it would
give power in many, though to afford <i>her</i> pleasure it must
partake of the practical feeling. Theology must have undergone a
good deal of consideration. Has a severe struggle with herself
and inward feelings. Annoys herself more than her neighbours;
knows herself better than others. There are few organizations so
good if they have been well cultivated. Drawing is not difficult.
Music pleasing. This organization partakes more of the male than
the female character. Is capable of going through a great deal of
struggling with difficulties. Fond of approbation, but does not
stoop to servile means to obtain it; will have a little struggle
with this organ. Kind and benevolent as far as her means go. Love
of children strongly developed.</p>
<p>This is the most powerful organization which I have seen, with
one exception. This is amazingly powerful, more destined by
nature for a male than a female head. It is a most general
organization, and though it may now be confined to one subject,
it can apply and excel in any number; mathematics, natural
history, the sciences, chemistry, analysis, &amp;c. She could
excel in anything. This organization is most like Certini, an
Italian improvisateur, and was originally intended for a male.
Her memory is so strong she can excel in anything, and would
never be confined to one subject. If she were to apply to the
dead languages she would become a proficient. There is nothing
she would take up in which she could not excel. Form and size are
good. Miniature and landscape painting, and drawing generally,
would be acquired with facility on this account. Few would go
more readily into the Hindostanee language, having memory to
recollect the characters. She has a very strong memory. Music
(organ of) requires more developement; has enough power in Time
(organ of.)</p>
<p>She principally wants a quicker arrangement in her ideas. She
has the power good, but a little more would make it gigantic. It
is not in proportion to the rest of the organization. She will
excel in the arts and sciences.</p>
<p>There are not half a dozen male organizations in the kingdom
with such a powerful memory. She is a thorough improvisatrice,
give her a subject, and she will make you a speech on it, or
write sheets full.</p>
<p>She is communicative on common topics, but has judgment to
discriminate when she may speak and when to be silent; would not
disclose a matter of importance, would suffer death first, rather
than do so, did the honour or character of another depend upon
it. Has a gigantic organization, more powerful than that of the
Marquis Mascati.                  Signed,</p>

<p>This professor of Phrenology remarked, on presenting the above
document, "I am willing to stake the truth of Phrenological
science on the developement of this head being in accordance with
the mind and actions of the individual."</p>
<p>Those who have had the honour of intimately knowing Mrs.
Chisholm, and others who have read of her acts may form a
judgment of the reliance to be placed in Phrenological science
from the above curious document, given before she attained the
public position she now occupies.</p>
<p>"The distinguishing character of Mrs. Chisholm," writes Mr.
Sidney, "is philanthropy&mdash;extending to all classes and all
sects&mdash;directed by a degree of common sense that almost
amounts to genius, united with an energy, a zeal, an Untiring
perseverance that renders nothing she undertakes impossible.</p>
<p>"<i>Her</i> philanthropy is not a mere amusement to be taken
up at odd hours, like a new romance&mdash;to be laid down as
quickly as it was taken up&mdash;to be satisfied by a
distribution of cheap tracts, or, at most, of cheap superfluous
guineas&mdash;by capricious visits to poor cottages, whose misery
renders the change from the luxurious drawing-room a pleasing
excitement. It is a part of her life of her daily duty. For the
cause she embraced, she has chosen to abandon the luxuries, nay,
the comforts, to which her fortune and station entitled her; to
wear stuff instead of silk; to work hard, to live hard, to save,
that she may spend upon her poor. * * Thousands have reason to
bless Mrs. Chisholm. We find her not like Mrs.
Fry&mdash;descending from the drawing-room to the prison, to
return, carriage borne, to that drawing room, when her errand of
mercy was done&mdash;but in the small room of a small house, in
an obscure suburb, writing at a rickety table, amidst piles of
colonial documents, and answers to her thousand
correspondents."</p>
<p>The governor, Sir George Gipps, frequently expressed the
esteem he felt for Mrs. Chisholm's works of humanity, and so
important to the executive power did he consider the nature of
her labours that he conferred a privilege upon her never but once
known to have been granted to a female, and that was the wife of
the American president, Jefferson,&mdash;he allowed her to
<i>frank letters</i>.</p>
<p>Sir George Gipps observed in council&mdash;"I cannot give a
stronger evidence of the economy of the people working for
themselves, than by referring to what has been done by Mrs.
Chisholm, and I am glad of this opportunity of doing justice to
that lady's exertions, and do it with much greater pleasure and
satisfaction, from having at the commencement of her labours
thrown cold water upon her plans."</p>
<p>The bishops of the colony, and the clergy of every
denomination, aided and applauded her works of mercy. Lord
Stanley, in 1844, wrote to the governor, saying, "you will
express to Mrs. Chisholm the high sense I entertain of her
services in behalf of the emigrants." Lord Grey has frequently
added his testimony of admiration and approbation of the
exertions of the benevolent lady. The committee of the
legislative council of New South Wales, in their report, "desire
to record their grateful sense of the valuable services of a
lady, to whose benevolent exertions on behalf of the unemployed,
as well as free emigrants of the humbler classes generally, this
colony is under the highest obligations&mdash;Mrs. Chisholm,
whose name is so well known in the colony for her disinterested
benevolence," Robert Lowe, Esq., late Fellow of Magdalene
College, Oxford, in a speech in the legislative council, says,
"One person only in the colony has done any thing effectual
anything on a scale which may be called large to mitigate this
crying evil and national sin, and to fix <i>families</i> on our
lands in lieu of bachelors. And, strange to say, that one is an
humble, unpretending, quiet-working <i>female</i> missionary! an
<i>emigrant</i> missionary not a clerical one! The singularity of
her mission, looking to the nature of her work, is one of the
most original that was ever devised or undertaken by either man
or woman; and the object, the labour, the design, are all beyond
praise."</p>
<p>After all these tributes to the humane acts of this lady from
the most influential sources, strange does it seem that there is
no mode of rewarding civic virtue. There seems something "rotten
in the state", where Mrs. Waghorne is pining in neglect, while
the descendents of a demoralized female excite sympathy and court
favour. Mrs. Chisholm's zeal and achievements are publicly
acknowledged.</p>
<p>Amid personal sacrifices made every hour of her life, she
still earnestly perseveres. Her plans are not confined to the
contracted circle of individual interest, but it is the duty and
work of a government that she is, and has been for some time
assiduously labouring to accomplish. On the page of Colonial
History, Mrs. Chisholm's name is now brilliantly written. In the
biographical records of the friends of mankind, she has worthily
earned a prominent position.</p>
<p>In her God-like mission, self has been absorbed in fervid
devotion to the Christian duties of charity and mercy. Her zeal
has been apostolic, and with purity of faith, love of mankind,
and reliance on God, she has toiled until triumphant. Bequeathing
results that will make thousands yet unborn, in their prayers to
heaven, call down blessings on the name of the philanthropist</p>

<h3>ADDENDA.</h3>
<p align="center"><b>[RULES, REGULATIONS AND HISTORY OF THE
FAMILY COLONIZATION LOAN SOCIETY.]</b></p>
<hr class="2">
<p>The following Rules and Regulations of the Society will
elucidate the entire system and show the minuteness of the
details to secure to the Emigrants' health and
comfort:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Membership</i>.&mdash;Intending Emigrants, and more
especially young and aged people, who desire to participate in
the protection this system of emigration affords, must become
Members, and comply with the Rules and Regulations of the
Society.</p>
<p><i>Testimonials</i>.&mdash;Certificates of good character must
be produced, from at least two respectable householders, before
applicants can be enrolled, or obtain a passage. All testimonials
are sent to the Colony before the sailing of the vessel conveying
the Emigrants, and are stamped with the Society's seal. By the
adoption of this plan the Certificates so stamped will be found
of essential benefit to the Emigrants on their arrival in
Australia. To preserve the respectability of the Society, and for
the comfort of the passengers, married persons are required to
show their marriage certificates.</p>
<p><i>Fees</i>.&mdash;Persons entered on the books of the Society
have to pay an entrance-fee of Is. each (the same for children).
Certificates of character must be forwarded and approved before
the entrance-fee can be taken, or the name entered. To meet the
current expenses of the Society, a further fee of 10s. each by
all adults, and 5s. each for all children under fourteen years of
age, must be paid in the Colony, with the last instalment of the
loan.</p>
<p><i>Payments, Loans, &amp;c.</i>.&mdash;Intending Emigrants
are, in the first instance, required to pay at least two-thirds
of their passage-money, which amount may be paid in instalments,
free of charge; the other portion of the passage-money will be
lent by the Society (if its funds admit of such loan being
granted), to be returned by the borrower. As a security for this
loan Emigrants are required to sign an <i>Agreement</i> (previous
to receiving their Embarkation Orders), that they will refund
such loans, through the instrumentality of Agents in the
Colonies, within one year after their arrival in the said
Colonies, or sooner, if possible, in order that the money so
repaid may be re-lent to others in like manner: while the
borrowers can nominate their own relatives and friends for a
passage and a loan, equal to the sum refunded by them, provided
the persons so named meet the approval of the Committee. Loans
are granted to persons paying their passage-money by weekly or
monthly instalments, and whose membership has extended over a
period of at least four months. Passages are granted only to
those persons who have paid to the Society the whole proportion
of money required for their passage.</p>
<p><i>Amount of Loan</i>.&mdash;This is entirely dependent upon
the state of the Society's funds, and eligibility of the party
for colonial employment, or other circumstances; but in no case
will the loan exceed &pound;4. for each adult.</p>
<p><i>Family Groups</i>.&mdash;Each body of Emigrants is divided
into groups containing twelve adults, who can take their meals
together during the passage. The object of this arrangement is
that friends and relatives may unite and aid each other in their
common emigration, and induce a social intimacy among strangers
previous to embarkation, by which means they enter the vessel as
acquaintances and friends, ready to assist in those little
services so conducive to happiness and comfort in a sea voyage.
Families and individuals who cannot meet with persons wishing to
emigrate from their own locality, have thus an opportunity of
meeting desirable associates, and mutually forming a group
advantageous both to their present and future views. By this
means an interest in each other's welfare in a new home is
created by personal reciprocal interests, and cemented by mutual
obligations. A list of the Associated Groups embarked, with their
names and ages, the place from which they emigrated, their
destination and subsequent settlement, the amount of loan
advanced, repayments made, the sums still due and by whom, will
be published as often as the Committee may deem proper.</p>
<p><i>Protection to Orphan Girls and Friendless
Families</i>.&mdash;The friendless young women are grouped with,
and introduced to families (at the Group Meetings held at Mrs.
Chisholm's residence, on Mondays, at seven o'clock in the
evening, previous to embarking), and placed under their special
guardianship. Arrangements are also made to insure mutual
responsibility for good conduct during the passage. In like
manner youth and young men are associated with family groups.
Members of groups must pledge themselves not to admit into their
body persons of doubtful character, as their comfort during the
voyage would be greatly lessened by so doing.</p>
<p><i>The Re-union of Families</i>.&mdash;Relatives and friends
now separated (some being in England, others in Australia), when
they are unable to pay the sum required for their passages, may
jointly, in both countries, make weekly and monthly deposits,
until they have by their united efforts raised the necessary
amount, which, with the aid of a loan from the Society, may
enable such parties to emigrate. In like manner, parties in
England anxious to emigrate, and who cannot at once pay the
required sum, can make <i>weekly</i> and <i>monthly</i> payments
towards their passage either through the Committee or local
Agents. If there happens to be a family with some grown-up
children, not possessing the necessary means to emigrate, one or
two of the most eligible precede the rest to the Colonies, and
through the mode of the re-union of Families, contribute to the
emigration of the remainder of the family. It will be the duty of
the Society's Agents in the Colony to remit these payments to the
Committee in England, for the specific purpose of enabling such
parties to emigrate. The Regulations of the Society do not admit
of the separation of man and wife, or of children without the
consent of their parents.</p>
<p><i>Notice of Departure</i>.&mdash;One month's notice is given
of the sailing of the vessel to which Emigrants may have been
nominated as that in which they can have a passage.</p>
<p><i>Price of Passage</i>.&mdash;The exact sum to be charged as
passage-money cannot be positively stated until a ship is
engaged. Children between one and fourteen half-price. Infants
nothing. The reason of any fluctuation in the charge arises from
the variation in prices at which vessels can be procured at
different periods. Any advantage resulting from favourable
circumstances is always given to the Emigrants.</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;The Society engage none but A 1 ships, and each
vessel carries an experienced surgeon.</p>
<p><i>Application for Membership</i>.&mdash;Persons desirous of
becoming members of the Society must state: 1. Their name and
age. 2. Place of residence and occupation. 3. Whether married or
single, male or female. 4. How much they can contribute towards
their passage. 5. What part they can pay immediately. 6. If they
require a loan, by what time, and by what instalments, they can
complete their payments.</p>
<p><i>Information</i>.&mdash;Any information that may be desired
can be obtained by applying (personally or by letter) to Mrs.
Chisholm, 3, Charlton Crescent, Islington, London; or at 29,
Bucklersbury, City. If application be made by letter, Two Stamps
must be enclosed for reply, or no answer can be sent. N.B. No
charge for information.</p>
<p><i>Colonial Agents</i>.&mdash;Captain Chisholm is now in the
Colonies for the purpose of appointing Agents. It will be the
duty of these Agents to receive from Emigrants all loans made by
the Society, and remit the same to the Committee in England. They
will he required to keep a register of all agreements entered
into, and the districts to which the Emigrants have proceeded;
and also to afford advice and assistance to Emigrants in
obtaining employment; and facilitate, by every means in their
power, the satisfactory settlement of each in the locality of
their choice. All advice and information in the Colonies will be
furnished <i>free of charge</i>, but no pecuniary aid can be
given.</p>
<p align="center"><small>ARRANGEMENTS ON BOARD THE SOCIETY'S
SHIPS.</small></p>
<p><i>Cabins</i>.&mdash;Enclosed cabins are furnished to each
family, of a size according to the number of individuals.
Children above fourteen years of age are provided with
compartments for sleeping separate from those of their parents.
One enclosed cabin is allotted to seven single females; also an
enclosed cabin for seven single men, in parts of the vessel
appropriated by classification for those berths. The arrangement
of the cabins is such as to provide for perfect order, decorum,
and morality.</p>
<p><i>Personal Comfort</i>.&mdash;Much personal comfort arises
from the feeling that all the passengers are on a footing of
equality, there being no classification in the Society's vessels,
and all possess the privilege of walking on the poop. When
preparing their meals, also, the passengers are not disturbed by
cabin or intermediate passengers, as none other than the
Society's Emigrants are allowed a passage in the same ship.</p>
<p><i>Ventilation</i>.&mdash;The novel contrivance for ensuring
ventilation between decks, fitted up in the "Athenian", at the
Society's expense, from plans by Dr. Bowie, being found extremely
effective in preserving health and comfort, will be continued in
all future vessels dispatched by the Society.</p>
<p><i>Cooking</i>.&mdash;The provisions being prepared by the
Emigrants, and delivered as directed in the "Ship Rules and
Regulations", will be cooked by an Emigrant's cook, provided to
perform that duty by the Society.</p>
<p><i>Children</i>.&mdash;It will be at the discretion of the
Surgeon to issue, three times a week, to children under seven
years of age, four ounces of Rice, or three ounces of Sago, in
lieu of Salt Meat.</p>
<p><i>Medical Comforts</i>.&mdash;For the information of the
Committee of the Society, the Surgeon of the vessel is required
to keep an account of the issue of medical comforts, with the
names of the parties receiving them.</p>
<p><i>Luggage</i>.&mdash;The bulk of luggage (<i>free of
charge</i>) allowed to each adult passenger is fifteen cubic
feet, ten in the hold and five in the cabin, with half that
amount for children. This includes the cabin box, which must not
be more than 1 ft. 6 in. long, 1 ft. 10 in. broad, and 1 ft. 2
in. deep. [A carpet bag is far more useful than a box.] The cabin
box (or bag) is to contain sufficient linen or other articles for
fourteen clay's use, as no other packages can on any account be
allowed in the cabins. The remainder of the baggage, marked
"Wanted on the voyage", will be so stowed in the hold that it can
be got at once a fortnight (or oftener) during the passage, for
the purpose of making any required exchange of apparel. All
packages of baggage must be distinctly marked with the name of
the passenger, -and also with the words "Wanted on the Voyage",
or "Not wanted on the Voyage;" and they must be at the docks,
ready for shipment, at least Five days prior to the day appointed
for sailing. Persons residing in the country can have printed
baggage tickets forwarded upon application, by enclosing Two
Stamps for the same, and stating the number they require. The
Society does not make arrangements for extra luggage.</p>
<p><i>Articles to be Provided by the Passengers</i>.&mdash;The
Society provide cooking and mess utensils, but the following
Articles must be provided by each Emigrant:&mdash;</p>
<!--Table p. 160-->

</table>
<p><i>Bedding</i>.&mdash;Passengers must provide themselves with
bedding: the size of mattress for a double bed place, 3 ft. by 6
ft.; for a single berth, 2 ft. by 6 ft. Feather beds are on no
account permitted.</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;Bedding, and all the Articles above named, can be
supplied by the Society to the Emigrants at contract price, if
preferred.</p>
<p><i>Security for the Emigrants' Comfort and
Health</i>.&mdash;In order that the Society's passengers may be
amply secured against any curtailment of their comforts, or their
health impaired by the over-crowding of the vessel, the Society
add ten per cent, to the space allowed by the Passengers' Act.*
In addition to a vastly increased space, the passengers are
accommodated with a Wash House upon Deck, an arrangement tending
greatly to increase the Emigrants' comfort and health. The
Charter-party (or agreement made with the Ship Agents and
Contractors by the Committee of the Society) also guarrantees
that every detail tending to the comfort and health of the
Emigrants shall be strictly observed. No wine, beer, or spirits,
is allowed to be sold to the Emigrants; and shaving on crossing
the line, burning tar barrels, or throwing water over the
Emigrants (as has been customary), is strictly prohibited. For
the due fulfilment of the above Regulations a bond of
&pound;2,500 is signed.</p>
<p class="foot">[* It may be as well to explain this more
fully:&mdash;If the Government (or passengers') Act states that
there is space enough for one hundred passengers, the Family
Colonization Loan Society occupy that space with only
<i>ninety</i>, or ten per cent. <i>less</i> than the law
permits.]</p>
<p><i>Duration of Voyage</i>.&mdash;Sixteen weeks is the average
duration of the voyage; and every Emigrant is entitled to draw
sixteen weeks rations, according to the Society's Weekly Dietary
Table, for March, 1852. here given:&mdash;</p>

<p>To prevent waste, parties no-t drawing the quantity to which
they are entitled, will receive the quantity due to them on
leaving the Ship. This reserve will be useful to them if they go
up the country, or until they have permanent employment.</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;The Society put on board Water and Provisions for
twenty-two weeks, in case the voyage should last so long; the
Emigrants are only allowed to draw, on leaving the Ship, what
they have saved from their weekly allowance for sixteen
weeks.</p>
<p>All the Groups are provided with printed receipts for their
weekly rations, and also for medical comforts should they be
required. Scales, weights, and measures, are put on board. The
Captain will have to deliver the receipts of the Emigrants, or
the provisions, to the Society's Agent in the Colony on his
arrival.</p>
<p><i>Debarkation</i>.&mdash;On the arrival of the Society's
vessels at Port Phillip, or any other destination, tents will be
erected (under the superintendence of the Society's Agent) for
their temporary residence. The "Mariner" has taken out tents for
the sole use of the Society's passengers. By this means persons
of both sexes will be secured from many expenses and
inconveniences too often resulting from seeking lodgings in
haste. One large tent will be used as an office for the engaging
of Emigrants. Persons engaging will be furnished by Captain
Chisholm, or the Society's Agents, with every advice and
information tending to their benefit and security, <i>free of all
charge</i>, but no pecuniary aid can be given.</p>
<p><i>Pledge of the Members</i>.&mdash;The following resolutions
were passed at a Group Meeting, <i>held at</i> Mrs. Chisholm's 3,
Charlton Crescent, Islington, <i>consisting of parties proposing
to emigrate to Australia by the aid of the Family Colonization
Loan Society. Since the sailing of the first vessel they have
been adopted by every Group, and are earnestly recommended to all
future Groups</i>.</p>
<p>Resolved "That we pledge ourselves, as Christian fathers and
heads of families, to exercise a parental control and
guardianship over all orphans and friendless females proceeding
with the family groups; to protect them as our children, and
allow them to share the same cabins with our daughters.</p>
<p>"We further resolve to discourage gambling, and not to take
cards or dice with us, or to enter into any pernicious amusements
during the voyage. We likewise resolve, by parental advice and
good example, to encourage and promote some well-advised system
of self-improvement during the passage.</p>
<p>"As the system of repayment proposed by this Society is one
that, if honourably kept, will add to the credit of the
working-classes as a body, and be the means of encouraging the
generous and good to assist our struggling countrymen, we hereby
solemnly pledge our honour as men, and our character us
Christians, to repay the loan advanced to us and impress the
sacredness of fulfilling this duty on each and all of the members
constituting the groups. We also promise to aid the colonial
agents in the recovery of all loans, and to make known, in
whatever part of the colonies we may he, the means by which
parties well to do there, may assist their relations in this
country through the medium of the Family Colonization Loan
Society.</p>
<p>"We further pledge ourselves not to introduce as candidates
for membership of the Society any men but those we know to be of
good character, or families but of good repute.</p>
<p>"We also determine not to accept of payment for any services
we may render on board ship, but endeavour individually and
collectively to preserve the order of a well-regulated family
during our passage to Australia, and to organize and establish a
system of protection that will enable our female relatives to
enter an emigrant ship with the same confidence of meeting with
protection as respectable females can now enter into our
steamers, trains, and mail-coaches.</p>
<p>"That all members constituting groups be asked for their
approval and fulfilment, as far as they may be individually
concerned, of the above resolutions."</p>
<p>Resolved.&mdash;"That the group do record and tender their
grateful thanks, and those of all members comprising groups, to
Mrs. Chisholm and the gentlemen who form the Committee of the
Family Colonization Loan Society."</p>
<p><i>Maternal Superintendency</i>.&mdash;The Committee have
requested&mdash;To undertake the motherly duty of seeing that all
the young females are in their sleeping apartments at a proper
hour, and they are most earnestly solicited never to retire to
rest leaving any girl on the Poop or Deck of the Ship. They are
also requested to visit the Female Cabins at least once a day, in
order to give such directions as may be necessary for the
preservation of order, cleanliness, and that propriety of
demeanour so becoming in young females. The above-named persons
are also particularly desired to caution the young females
against song-singing, or any noisy amusement, in the Stern
Cabins, or on the Poop, or Deck of the Ship.</p>
<p>The parties named above are likewise requested to make
arrangements with the Surgeon for rendering any assistance to
sick persons that may be necessary.</p>
<p align="center">AMUSEMENTS.</p>
<p>Arrangements will be made for amusements; and parents of
mature age are requested, for the sake of the young, to be
present on such occasions, so that there may be mirth without
danger and amusement without remorse.</p>
<p align="center">FAMILY GROUPS.</p>
<p>We, the undersigned heads of Families, associated as Mr.      
       Group, having produced our marriage certificates to each
other and made personal enquiries into the respectability of all
in our group, and being satisfied, have voluntarily agreed to
mess together during our voyage to Australia, and to afford
parental protection to such young persons as are admitted into
our Group, and will consider and treat them as members of our
family.</p>
<p>Equal [two children under a certain age are counted as one
adult,] to 12 Adults, who are entitled to a weekly supply of
Provisions as under stated:</p>

for the sixth 7 days, and so on through the voyage.</p>
<p>Mr.              has been elected by the Group to keep the
dietary account book.</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;The Groups should be composed of a party of 12 or
24 persons, as they can then take their meals together during the
voyage.</p>
<p align="center">RULES AND REGULATIONS TO BE OBSERVED ON BOARD
THE SOCIETY'S VESSELS.</p>
<p align="center"><small>SUPERINTENDENT&mdash;THE
SURGEON.</small></p>
<p>Rule 1.&mdash;The Groups are to choose six persons from their
body, to be called the Group Committee, whose duty will be to
preserve order on the Lower Deck, and see that deck kept clean;
to attend during the issue of provisions, to see that each mess
has the proper allowance; and to keep a register of the Brands on
the various casks of provisions, that they may know they are
consuming the provisions put on board for their use. The
appointment of the first Committee (to act for one month only)
devolves upon Mrs. Chisholm; at the expiration of that period the
Groups can elect others. The following six persons have been
selected by Mrs. Chisholm, for the reasons assigned opposite
their names:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p>2.&mdash;For the more effectual preservation of order and
regularity, all complaints are to be made to the Surgeon, through
the medium of the Group Committees, in order that he may apply to
the Captain, should it become necessary, with a view to remedy
the cause of complaint.</p>
<p>3.&mdash;No smoking allowed on the Poop, Lower Deck, or abaft
the Main Mast on the Upper Deck.</p>
<p>4.&mdash;Single Men are not allowed to go abaft the Main
Hatchway on the Lower Deck (except during meals).</p>
<p>5.&mdash;One side of the Poop Deck to be retained clear of
Passengers, for the Captain's use and comfort, and that of his
Officers. The Group Committee are to see this rule strictly
carried out.</p>
<br>
<p>6.&mdash;The Passengers are to leave the Poop Deck at
Half-past Eight in the evening, and the lamps extinguished at
Ten, with the exception of four on the Lower Deck, and one in the
Poop, which are to be left burning during the night. No lights of
any kind are permitted in the Cabins, nor may those hanging over
the tables be removed.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;No lines for drying clothes to be placed in the
Cabins, or between decks, such practice being very injurious to
health.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;Fire-arms, Gunpowder, Lucifer Matches, or other
inflammable materials, are to be delivered to the Captain on
going on board. If discovered in any Passenger's custody during
the voyage, they will be taken possession of by the Captain.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;The Surgeon is to appoint two careful persons to
clean and trim the lamps, who are also to see that the
Passengers' mess utensils are brought on the Upper Deck to be
cleaned, perfect cleanliness between decks being imperative to
health.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;The Scuttles are not to be opened, except by the
Carpenter of the ship, who will have orders to do so, whenever
deemed advisable, by the Officer of the Watch.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;Provisions are to be issued at the following hours:
Water, daily, at Half-past Six in the morning; and all Provisions
at Ten o'clock in the Morning of the days specified in the Ration
Regulations.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;The <small>RULES FOR MEALS</small> are as follow:
The odd Messes, viz., 1, 3, 5, &amp;c., will <i>Breakfast</i> at
Eight o'clock in the Morning, <i>Dine</i> at One in the
Afternoon, and <i>Sup</i> at Five in the Evening. The Even
Messes, viz., 2, 4, 6, &amp;c., will <i>Breakfast</i> at Nine in
the Morning, <i>Dine</i> at Two in the Afternoon, and <i>Sup</i>
at Six in the Evening.</p>
<p>13.&mdash;The Emigrants are to prepare their food for cooking,
and take it to and receive it from the Cook appointed in the
Emigrants' service. This duty, it is hoped, will always be done
by one of the men of each mess, as it is not proper for
respectable females to go forward amongst the ship's crew.</p>
<p>14.&mdash;Passengers are strictly prohibited from giving any
Wine, Spirits, or Beer, to any of the Ship's Company or
Passengers' Cook.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;The Surgeon will attend on the Lower Deck daily at
the hours of Ten in the Morning and Five in the Evening. It is
requested that all applications for Medicines will be made at
those hours, except in cases of emergency.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;As Ventilation and Cleanliness are essential to the
health and well-being of every person on board, it is earnestly
recommended, and hoped the Group Committees will strictly
enforce, that the Beddings, &amp;c., from the Berths, be brought
on deck twice in each week (viz., Tuesdays and Fridays, if
practicable), aired, and the Berths well cleaned.</p>
<p>17.&mdash;It is requested that for the washing of Passengers'
clothes and articles in use, the same days (viz., Tuesdays and
Fridays) will be employed, and washing concluded before Eight in
the Morning.</p>

<p align="center">AUSTRALIA AND WHO SHOULD EMIGRATE.</p>
<p>The following brief, but excellent advice on the subject is
published by the <small>COMMITTEE OF AUSTRALIAN COLONISTS</small>
now sitting in London.</p>
<p>AUSTRALIA includes Five Colonies:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center">NEW SOUTH WALES.</p>
<p>Capital City and principal Ports&mdash;<small>SYDNEY</small>
and <small>MORETON BAY</small>; Population by last Census,
180,000; Imports, &pound;1,670,300; Exports, &pound;1,990,900;
Sheep, 7,026,000; Cattle, 1,360,100; Horses, 111,200.</p>

LINCOLN</small>. Population, 67,000; Imports, &pound;887,423;
Exports, &pound;571,348: Copper Metal, 44,594 cwt.; Copper Ore,
8,784 tons; Sheep, 1,200,000; Horned Cattle, 100,000; Horses,
6,000.</p>
<p align="center">WESTERN AUSTRALIA.<br></p>
<p>Ports&mdash;<small>PERTH</small> and <small>KING GEORGE'S
SOUND</small>.</p>
<p align="center">VAN DIEMEN'S LAND.<br></p>
<p>Ports and Cities&mdash;<small>HOBART TOWN</small> and
<small>LAUNCESTON</small>.</p>
<p>With two exceptions, the chief occupations of Australia are
the same, viz.: Pastoral and Agricultural; Sheep and Cattle have
long been the favourite investment of settlers; and shepherds,
herdsmen, bullock-drivers, and the like, will find an unlimited
demand for their services.</p>
<p>Agriculture is carried on extensively and successfully in all
the Colonies by small farmers, who work with their families, and
hire not more than one or two men, except in harvest time.
Agriculture cannot be carried on successfully, after the European
plan, by a farmer hiring much labour, except in rare cases near a
large town.</p>
<p>In South Australia, Copper Mining has been actively pursued
since 1845. The exports are large; and one mine, the Burra Burra
is the richest in the world.</p>
<p>Gold has been found in very large quantities in New South
Wales, chiefly near Bathurst, 160 miles from the coast, and in
Victoria, at Ballarat, 40 miles from the port of Geelong, and
Mount Alexander, 90 from Melbourne.</p>
<p>As Sydney has 60,000 inhabitants, Melbourne 25,000, and
Adelaide 15,000, there are the same trades and professions
carried on there as in the most thriving towns, of the same
population, of Europe; but the fluctuations of trades are rapid,
and professions are easily glutted.</p>
<p>Gentlemen of education without capital, clerks, and persons of
that class, should not emigrate unless they are prepared to
become shepherds, or to dig for gold, or accept menial
employment.</p>
<p>Gentlemen of capital, large or small, will act most wisely in
refraining from making any investment for at least twelve months
after arriving in the colony.</p>
<p>A working farmer, or a market gardener, may readily earn a
comfortable living by renting or purchasing land within a
convenient distance of a town.</p>
<p>The following Trades are good:&mdash;Carpenter; Blacksmith,
first rate; Bricklayer; Stonemason; Sawyer; Well-sinker; Miner;
Wheelwright; Tailor; Bootmaker; Tanner.</p>
<p>A Tailor married, need not be first rate; should be prepared
to become a shepherd, also, if necessary.</p>
<p>Ornamental trades are in very moderate demand, such as Carvers
and Gilders, fine Cabinet-makers, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Demand for Compositors limited.</p>
<p>The man who works in iron must do anything from repairing a
steam-boiler, to shoeing a horse, and the same with the man who
works in wood.</p>
<p>A man who can handle tools in a rough useful manner, drive a
team, fell, dig, and plough, and understands cattle, will do best
of all. The working man who knows only how to work will make a
good shepherd.</p>
<p>There is a steady demand and high wages for female domestic
servants and for stout country girls, accustomed to daily and
country work. All these can, if they please, marry
respectably.</p>
<p>For Governesses there is little demand, unless such as are
prepared to be generally useful in assisting the mistress of the
house. A few well-introduced may do well, but the market is
generally soon overstocked.</p>
<p>Sewing is not a good trade in the sea-ports; in the interior
it pays for a married woman.</p>
<p>For industrious, sober, married couples, suitable for farm
servants and shepherds, and for stout, intelligent boys, of ten
and upwards, the demand may be said to be unlimited. Good wages
may also be earned by the young children of a shepherd or
ploughman, from even the age of eight.</p>
<p>The discovery of gold has so much disturbed and raised the
rate of wages that it is difficult to state an average.</p>
<p>But for many years the wages of a shepherd have ranged from
&pound;20. per annum to &pound;31. 4s., with a hut and rations of
10 lbs. flour, 12 lbs. meat, &frac14; lb. tea, and 2 lbs. sugar,
per week.</p>
<p>A shepherd's wife, cooking for him and one other man, has
received &pound;9, with the same rations, and an allowance for
children, above eight years old. These money have recently risen
fifty, and more, per cent, and the skilled mechanics in
proportion.</p>
<p>A common Labourer digging at the Gold Fields earns from 8s. to
12s. per day.</p>
<p>Gentlemen desiring to embark in the purchase of live stock,
and become, according to the Colonial phrase, squatters, will
have to purchase the tennant-right of a run, or grazing ground,
from an occupier holding at a rent under the Crown, as all the
pastures accessible from a port are occupied. Brothers, or
friends in partnership, with capital, will have a better chance
in sheep and cattle than single individuals.</p>
<p>Letters of introduction are generally useless, unless
accompanied by letters of credit.</p>
<p>Certificates, properly attested, of good character, are useful
to men seeking employment.</p>
<p align="center">OUTFIT, &amp;c.</p>
<p>As little baggage, and as much money as possible. No goods on
speculative investments. There are plenty of mercantile firms,
with whom a stranger cannot compete. A workman should take his
tools.</p>
<p>No wooden furniture. A family may take linen, plated goods,
knives, and forks, if they have them. Letters of credit may be
obtained from the</p>

<p align="center"><b>THE FAMILY COLONIZATION LOAN
SOCIETY.</b></p>
<hr class="2">
<p>An account of the labours of Mrs. Chisholm would be imperfect
without the details of that Society which she has so
perseveringly struggled to establish during the last three years
of her life. The faith that she had a mission to perform, the
carrying out of which was a duty to her Creator, and overflowing
with love of her fellow-beings, has borne her triumphantly
through difficulties that would have appalled many a stout, manly
heart. Personal deprivations have been incurred and cheerfully
endured which wives and mothers, ordinarily, from self-love and
family interest shrink from encountering; and that elegant
display, luxurious home, and enjoyment of refined society, which
position and means places at command and maintains, have been by
Mrs. Chisholm totally disregarded. With meagre means to carry out
a great national undertaking, a governmental duty, and selfish as
well as bigotted prejudices ever rising in her path, she has
combatted and conquered&mdash;every obstacle subdued&mdash;and
now firmly established a society and system that has given a
death blow to the horrible practices of emigration the offspring
of sordid and callous hearts, and rendered a model to the world
for the safe, moral, and comfortable transit of vast bodies of
people seeking across a broad ocean, a new home, and the entire
enjoyment of the fruits of their toil. Truly applicable were the
words applied to her by the Earl of Shaftesbury "the children
shall arise and call her blessed."</p>
<p>The Society, as we have already stated, was projected by Mrs.
Chisholm in 1847, on her return from Australia, after
successfully working at colonization for seven years. By the end
of 1849 she had collected some two hundred parties, who, by small
instalments, had paid nearly two-thirds of their passage-money.
In 1850 she procured the patronage of her first committee,
including the Earl of Shaftesbury, (then Lord Ashley) Mr. Sydney
Herbert, Mr. Vernon Smith, Mr. Wyndham Harding, and Mr. Tidd
Pratt. A small sum of money was subscribed, towards which the t
Countess of Pembroke gave &pound;250. The society was brought
before the public in May, 1850; in September, 1850, the first
ship, the <i>Slains Castle</i>, was despatched with 189 statute
emigrants, or about 250 men, women, and children. Towards their
passages the emigrants paid, by instalments, &pound;1403. The
Society lent &pound;865, to be repaid in two years by earnings in
the colony; part of this loan has been repaid, we give the
following account of this vessel and its departure which will
convey an idea of all the others to the reader.</p>
<p>The Slains Castle, whilst lying at the East India Export Dock,
Blackwall, was visited by great numbers of persons, who were
highly gratified with the arrangements and contrast afforded to
other vessels engaged in the same service.</p>
<p>On descending to the lower deck the scene was most striking.
All usual erections being removed, there was a clear length of
100 feet of deck. The cabins, ranged on each side, were numbered,
and resembled a ward in Greenwich or Chelsea Hospital. Those
intended for a man and his wife were of a certain size, while
those for a party of females were larger. The bedsteads for a
married couple consisted of broad stout laths, one-half of the
length of which were placed to fit into the other, so that when
not needed to sleep upon they could be slid back, and the
bedstead become one half the size. By this contrivance there was
a couch formed for the day, and by a board sliding in a support
for the back, while the room gained left a private cabin for the
occupants. A wash stand in a corner, and some other trifling
articles, completed the fittings. In some of these there was a
small bed-place a little above for a young child. In the young
women's cabins two sides had each two berths, while another side
had a couch which drew out to allow a mother and daughter, or
elderly female and young child, to sleep upon. This last-named
party had charge of the young women in the cabin; and, as one of
the girls in the group was selected from having parents 011
board, her mother had a right to entry to see her daughter: thus
a double guardianship become exercised. By a space being left at
the bottom, and the frame-work not reaching the roof by several
inches, a free and perfect circulation of air was allowed in each
cabin, besides, there being a small window covered by a piece of
coloured cotton; thus there were privacy, air, and light. At the
end of this deck were domestic offices for females and children
while others for men were on deck. At the bows a part was
partitioned off for the young men, where there were two ranges of
bed places, and tables, with ample room, where in quiet and
retirement they could pursue their studies during the voyage.
Down the centre of the deck between the cabins were tables for
the meals and other purposes of the emigrants, above which were
shelving for the dishes.</p>
<p>The completeness and excellence of the arrangements are thus
seen, while, the passengers having the use of the entire deck and
poop of the vessel, it must be acknowledged that every means was
taken to render them comfortable and healthy; their interest
being considered paramount in every particular.</p>
<p>The emigrants were not of that class who have sunk in poverty
and despair, who, reckless of consequences, sought but for
change; they seemed men stem in purpose, borne forward by
self-respect; they appeared to feel that within themselves they
possessed powers to attain a higher destiny in society than their
efforts in this country could achieve; that by changing the field
of their exertions God in his mercy and love would accord, as a
reward for their labour, peace, love, and plenty: in that
reliance fear become dim and hope radiant.</p>
<p>During the early part of Saturday, the 28th ult., there was
all the usual bustle, confusion, and hurry of embarkation on the
decks of the Slains Castle. The flag that has "braved the battle
and the breeze" boldly graced the bows, others gaily decorated
the vessel, but that which most attracted attention was one
symbolic of the spirit that guided the present enterprise, and
hung from the mizen. It was a present from a party of ladies to
Mrs. Chisholm, of "true blue" colour having in gold-coloured type
a monogram of Mrs. Chisholm's name, C. C., linked together by the
stout part of the letters, and surrounded by the letters
F.C.L.S.&mdash;Family Colonization Loan Society. The
indefatigable Mrs. Chisholm was on board, practicially and
beneficially bestowing her experience, and with her maternal
solicitude superintending all arrangements for the domestic
comforts of the emigrants. A party of six friendless handsome
Irish girls seemed to have a large share of her attention and
care; all that circumstances and human foresight could provide
for their well-being, and exhortation to prudence and caution of
conduct was judiciously bestowed. It was surprising to watch how
any unexpected difficulty that arose was promptly removed, how
every petty detail was regarded and controlled, by this
extraordinary woman. A family at the last moment found they could
not go by this vessel&mdash;another anxious and ready, filled
their places; a family presented itself, the mother of whom but
four days before had undergone the ordeal of maternity&mdash;Mrs.
Chisholm, in respect of her sex, promised a passage in three
weeks by another vessel, but was met by a refusal; she then
declined the responsibility of receiving the anxious emigrant
without a doctor's certificate; this was procured, and the
invalid carried on board. The searching eye of Mrs. Chisholm
caught the face of a baby, and she detected incipient measles in
the family. They were tenderly refused admission, and carefully
placed in a cab, with money for their immediate requirements, and
promise of future attention and an early passage. We noticed with
melancholy feelings a poor youth who had set out in life with all
the bright aspirations of fame as an artist; his first public
attempt met with disfavour; his buoyant hopes were prostrated a
blight seized his mind and he sank under the unexpected blow;
despondency overshadowed him, and paralyzed in action, he sought
a new life, home, and country, where, unknown, and with other
occupations, he might gain a renewal of energy of mind. We have
at many ports witnessed the departure of emigrants when it seemed
as if the separation was a violent tearing up of sturdy roots of
affection, agony, and despair being wound up to the highest pitch
of human endurance. In the present instance, when the command for
departure was given, it appeared to us as if the affections about
to be separated were but slender tendrils; and in this one fact
is shown the nobleness and virtue of the scheme. Among these
emigrants were many about to join in ease and comfort their
dearest friends, while others had 011 board around them their
relatives and families, all that was nearest and most beloved by
them on earth. Thus it is a system in accordance with
nature&mdash;with God's holiest laws. Certainly in all cases
there are exceptions&mdash;two children were parting with their
parent; at the last moment they dropped on their knees and
besought, with stifled voice, a father's blessing; he knelt, his
feelings for a time chocked his utterance, when with fervid words
he resigned them into the hands of Almighty God, and besought
them ever by their conduct to merit His mercy&mdash;His love.</p>
<p>The large crowd moved with the stately vessel to the last
point of the dock, when, the word for "all hands on shore" being
given, the mongrel crew of dock labourers rapidly tumbled out of
the ship, and as if by magic, in the next instant the forecastle
was crowded by as noble a crew of powerful British tars as could
be seen, ready and able to perform their laborious and dangerous
duties. We would defy any Englishman to witness such a sight
without feelings of pride in his country. The steam-tug being
affixed, the last rope on shore was cast loose, when cheer after
cheer from the windows and roof of the crowded inn, and mass of
people arose, and was responded to by the emigrants. Mrs.
Chisholm, who was gazing at the scene from a prominent part of
the vessel, turned round and observed, "Well, at length, here is
emigration for and by the people!" Mixing with the crowd on deck,
we observed the prolonged gaze of many a reddened eye&mdash;we
saw the silent tear trickle down the cheek&mdash;we heard the
deep sigh and subdued sob&mdash;the cheek and lips of manhood
blanched and the agitated nerves make the trembling of the hand.
The grief of some was calm and deep, while a few appeared as
hilarious as if proceeding on a gipsying party. The vessel
proceeded down to Gravesend, where she anchored, Mrs. Chisholm
making a continued round of inspection during the time, assisting
and advising in every particular.</p>
<p><i>Sunday on Board</i>.&mdash;Two hundred friends of the
emigrants lodged at Gravesend during Saturday night, and early on
Sunday morning proceeded on board the Slains Castle. A clergyman
of the Church of England, the Rev.. Edward Bullock, commenced the
religious duties of the day by reading prayers, after which the
Wesleyans performed service according to the mode of their
Society; next followed two Roman Catholic priests, who delivered
most appropriate exhortations, but dispensed with the usual
ceremonies of their church. Never in any country (and it has been
our fate to see many) did we ever see so truly a Christian spirit
prevail, such harmony of sentiment and brotherly love. The sight
was most exciting and admirable; it gave us hope; and we felt
assured, were such meetings of more frequent occurrence, the
painful asperities of sectarianism would die away, and the true
spirit of Christianity be prevalent. But a still more
extraordinary scene presented itself&mdash;one which, perhaps,
never before occurred on board any vessel, and was deeply
impressive on the now immense crowd on board, for it appeared
about 800 persons visited the ship. In the afternoon there issued
from the captain's apartments a train of clergymen, arrayed in
surplices, about twenty-four in number! They mounted the poop and
went through the beautiful services of our Established Church;
then a sermon was delivered, which produced a deep and serious
impression on the assembly, while the Psalms sung, perhaps, were
never echoed on the vault of heaven with more fervour and
sincerity. Later in the afternoon an address on teetotalism was
delivered. The sacred day was spent in listening to the sublime
truths of holy writ, and in showing that they must be the guide
of erring man, who would desire happiness on earth and obtain
eternal life in heaven.</p>
<p>We found that among the emigrants were 120 communicants of the
Church of England, two Jewesses, and the others about equally
divided between Wesleyans and Roman Catholics.</p>
<p>On Monday Mrs. Chisholm went on board to bid the emigrants
farewell. The men all came on deck and seated themselves around
their noble patron and friend. She exhorted them as to their
conduct, when they unanimously pledged themselves "as Christian
fathers and heads of families to exercise a parental control and
guardianship over all orphans and friendless females proceeding
with the family groups, to protect them as their children, and
allow them to share the same cabins as their daughters; also to
discourage gambling and any pernicious amusements during the
voyage; and by parental advice and good example to encourage and
promote some well-devised system of self improvement during the
passage." The lady likewise begged of them not only to be the
guardians of the females, but also of religious liberty to their
fellow-voyagers. Mrs. Chisholm, proceeding below, in a most
feeling manner addressed the females on their conduct and duties.
The moment for separation now arrived, but the pen is powerless
in describing the scene that took place. A young Jewess clasped
her in her arms, kissed her, and called her "her dear mother."
Other females wept aloud. The old women, hung about her praying
for the "blessings of God to be her portion." The men in silent
grief grasped her hand; and the last cheer given was one which
must ever tell forcibly on the feelings of a mother: it was
"Three cheers for Mrs. Chisholm's children!" On Tuesday afternoon
the anchor of the Slains Castle was weighed&mdash;her sails
spread to the wind. The second ship, the <i>Blundell</i>, sailed
in May, 1851, with 218 adult emigrants, and several children, who
paid &pound;1942, and borrowed &pound;674 from the Society. The
third ship, the Athenian, sailed in September, 1851, with 209
emigrants, and their young families, who paid &pound;1942, and
borrowed &pound;524. Thus, in twelve months, during a period that
the government had been unable to fill several of their ships
with emigrants to whom they gave a free passage, and when filled
had only been able to obtain a class whom Earl Grey termed the
refuse of workhouses, inferior to convicts. Mrs. Chisholm had
been able to collect families of the most industrious and frugal
class, numbering one thousand souls, and contributing
&pound;5237. In this vessel, the surgeon, K. Bowie, Esq., who had
been one of the most active professional men of the Board of
Health, during the raging of cholera, finding that interest, not
capabilities and a rigid self-sacrificing to duty, led to a just
public reward for labour, in disgust sought with his family a
home on Australia's shores; this gentleman fitted up two
perforated zinc tubes extending from the stem to the stern of the
vessel, and continued on to the deck, one tube was placed along
the roof of the cabins, the other the floor, the first carried
off the used air, the latter brought in fresh, and such was the
excellence of this plan that all the effluvia from the close
congregation of so many people and from the large quantity of
cooked meat was completely drawn away as it arose, while at the
equator, between decks, the temperature was two degrees less than
under the poop. He also had a simple contrivance for distilling
sea-water, which extra supply was distributed for sanitary
measures. These contrivances being found so valuable, efficient,
and even economical, they now form a portion of the arrangements
in the Society's vessels. Economical, certainly, for they save
the "medical stores", and instead of the vessel arriving with a
number of emigrants worn out with sickness, their constitutions
injured, and requiring months to recover a tone of health that
they may be able to labour, they find themselves capable of
entering on active employment the instant they land, as has been
practically proved for there was not one un-engaged the second
day after the arrival of the Blundell. On the Athenian touching
at the Cape four female children had been added to the
passengers, born on the ocean wave. It is curious to read the
written bills of entertainment on the voyage. The recitations,
concerts, &amp;c., "by particular desire" "under distinguished
patronage" "from indisposition" "previous engagements" M.&mdash;
M.&mdash; "will not appear until the following public
entertainment, of which due notice will be given." "First
appearance." "Glorious hit," and that "between the first and
second parts refreshments will be handed to all the audience," a
species of liberality much to be envied under more favourable
circumstances.</p>
<p>The Athenian sailed in February, 1852, with 209 adults and
their children, the passage-money in which being 13, and the
society lending an average of &pound;2 per head, the emigrants
contributed about &pound;2700; a remarkable trait of the superior
moral character of the emigrants. All this amount of emigration
with the multitudinous affairs of the Society, has been
accomplished without the usual expensive machinery of colonising
companies "Mrs. Chisholm and her family" says Mr. Sidney gave up
their time gratuitously to the work, with the aid of one clerk,
and one old woman to open the door to the inquirers who knocked
from morning to night. She has received eighty letters and forty
calls on the subject of emigration in one day. Mrs. Chisholm's
success was owing not less to her common sense, her business-like
habits and experience, than to her energetic philanthropy. Her
plan was extremely simple. Every Monday evening she held meetings
of intending emigrants at her small house, No, 3, Charlton
Crescent, Islington, where they obtained information, and made
acquaintance with each other. Groups were formed of from three to
eight families, who co-operated for mutual assistance on the
voyage. These groups each elected a representative, and these
formed committees for a variety of useful objects onboard.
Instalments were taken as low as Is. a week. When a sufficient
number had paid up to justify the society in taking a ship, an
economy was effected in the passage-money, while the best
provisions, good ventilation, enclosed berths, and superior
arrangement for the decent comfort of families and the protection
of single girls and friendless children were secured. Every ship
was an improvement on the preceding one; and the society aimed
not only at assisting as many emigrants as possible, but at
affording an example of model emigration."</p>
<p>On the 18th of February, 1852, the Family Colonisation Loan
Society held in London one of the most numerous and enthusiastic
meetings ever assembled in this country on the subject of
emigration; the Earl of Shaftesbury in the chair, who stated "he
had seen in the last ship a family which included a child six
weeks old, and a grandmother who had attained eighty-four years."
More than 2500 persons were present; every corner, every rafter
that could be reached was crowded, and the great hall, viewed
from the platform, presented an undulating sea of faces, all
deeply intent on the business of the evening. The flags of all
nations ornamented the bare walls. At the end of the room,
opposite the chairman, in huge letters, the mottoes "Advance
Australia", "Speed the Plough", and an initial monagram of
F.C.L.S. on the blue flag of the ship about to sail, were
displayed. The Earl of Shaftesbury had Mrs. Chisholm on his right
hand, and on his left the Eight Hon. Sidney and Mrs. Herbert,
with a party of their friends; Messrs. Gone, William Jackson,
James Levick, M'Clellan, and others engaged in the Australian
trade; and Messrs. Stanley Carr, S. Devonport, M'Nab, Churnside,
Russell, and other Australian colonists were among the parties
who crowded the platform. The street was thronged by parties
unable to obtain admission.</p>
<p>The Australian city of London merchants seeing the want of
labour in the colonies subscribed about &pound;4000 to aid the
movement, and in the first instance, using Mrs. Chisholm's name,
endeavoured to set on foot a plan of emigration, but ultimately
abandoned it to the guidance of that lady, they taking the
honorary post of committee-men in addition to the older members
who had aided the labours of Mrs. Chisholm.</p>
<p>The discovery of gold in the Australian colonies has increased
the demand for emigration, and the energy of emigrants to attain
their passage; this, likewise, has greatly risen the price of
freightage of vessels, while the ferment in the colonies
themselves unhinge matters from that calm and progressive state
that formerly could he almost positively ensured. From these
circumstances the same urgency for loans does not exist, and
prudence dictates that they should not be on the same scale as
heretofore. The establishment of the society is a new era in the
history of emigration.</p>
