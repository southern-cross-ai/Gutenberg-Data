  <p class="headline">THE BLOCKADE OF BUENOS AYRES.<br>
  (Reuter's Special Service).<br>
  Barbadoes, June 1st.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">The four-masted ship <i>Jane and Elizabeth,</i> with
  linseed from Buenos Ayres, put in here yesterday for stores and water, and
  sailed to-day for London, all well. She reported having successfully passed
  through the blockading fleet on the night of May 9th.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THUS the <i>Daily Telegraph,</i> and as the sun shone
  through the high office window, and flashed again from the tiny sample
  bottles of essential oils, it only heightened the dismal expression upon the
  face of Jenkinson Brothers. When people spoke of Jenkinson Brothers, the
  oldest established firm of drug merchants in Mincing Lane, they meant Josiah.
  Now, Josiah was ambitious, also he was young when he became the sole
  representative of the firm. The fluctuations of <i>ipecacs</i> and
  <i>cumquats</i> soon ceased to interest him; he forsook humdrum lines of
  business and wandered into crooked paths of speculation, until he now found
  himself the possessor of a seriously diminished credit and a capital which
  had almost ceased to exist. He had long meditated a bold stroke which should
  revive the sensitive plant of his credit and rob settling-day of some of its
  terrors, when the failure of the linseed crop of 1899 gave him his
  opportunity. Linseed, as a general rule, is not an article that can be
  cornered, but on this occasion everything conspired to render him assistance.
  A parasite, spreading with extraordinary rapidity from the East, had
  devastated the Russian crops, whilst a succession of typhoons in the Sundas
  and adjoining islands made short work of the large reserves which had been
  accumulated there. Men's eyes turned towards the New World. Argentina stepped
  into the breach, and every ship that had room on her manifest soon overflowed
  with the now precious seed; but before a single one could clear from Buenos
  Ayres a revolution broke out. The five-hundred-and-twentieth president took
  refuge in the city, and was there besieged by the Army, who had turned their
  general into the five-hundred-and-twenty-first; whilst the Navy, following
  the lead of the Army, declared for the insurgents and straightway blockaded
  the harbour.</p>

  <p>It was now that Josiah, in daring mood, aspired to control the market. At
  first he bought cautiously and quietly; then, emboldened by success, with
  less and less caution, and as the price soared upwards he continued to buy,
  until at length the magnitude of the deal reached a figure that he trembled
  to contemplate. It was a small matter to him that the older men in the market
  looked askance at his operations; he was regarded with admiration by the
  smaller fry of speculators, and as they deferentially made way for him in the
  Lane, visions of a yacht, a country estate, and even&mdash;why not?&mdash;a
  seat in Parliament, floated before his eyes.</p>

  <p>But these golden dreams were short-lived. On this particular morning of
  June, 1899, the price of linseed had beaten the record within the memory of
  the oldest broker. Already there were rumours of synthetical substitutes in
  the market. The crisis called for all Josiah's nerve, and he was about to
  commence the interesting zoological process known as "squeezing the bears"
  (in other words, to demand the impossible feat of delivering the seed of
  which he was the nominal purchaser), when his eye fell on Reuter's message;
  and as he read, the room swam round him.</p>

  <p>"Captain Jenkinson to see you, sir."</p>

  <p>At any other time Josiah would have replied with one of the numerous
  excuses which people find for invisibility to an impecunious relation, but at
  present he was too confused to do more than gaze stupidly at his visitor, who
  had followed close on the heels of the clerk, and took a chair without
  waiting to be invited.</p>

  <p>Captain Jenkinson wore a beard trimmed in the naval style known as
  "torpedo-fashion," but his dress showed none of a sailor's neatness. On his
  jacket, some buttons were odd and some were missing, whilst the whole suit
  gave evidence of having suffered many things from the elements; his eyes were
  shaded by a cap from which the house badge had disappeared; his linen, what
  there was to be seen of it, was frayed and grubby; his boots were cracked,
  also he exhaled an atmosphere of rank cigars. Altogether, Captain Jenkinson
  presented an out-at-elbow appearance, as he sat regarding the drug merchant
  with a half-defiant, half-curious air. At length, feeling the silence
  oppressive&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Jos," he said emphatically, "I'm stony broke!"</p>

  <p>Josiah started and exclaimed irritably: "And a man who gets drunk on duty
  deserves to be!"&mdash;an amiable allusion to the captain's recent piling-up
  of a coasting tramp, with the consequent loss of his certificate.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's only by his own brother that a man need expect to be hit
  when he's down," growled the other. "But I say, Jos, I'm absolutely and
  completely broke."</p>

  <p>"So am I!"</p>

  <p>"You! Why, the <i>Financial Blackmailer</i> calls you a 'Napoleon of
  Finance!' I read it myself just now in the clerk's office."</p>

  <p>"Napoleon be hanged!" was the testy reply. "Here, read that!" and Josiah
  pushed the newspaper across to his brother, pointing to the telegram from
  Barbadoes.</p>

  <p>The captain read and re-read the paragraph, then laying it down: "Well, it
  reads all straightforward enough. What's the matter with it?"</p>

  <p>"Matter enough!" retorted the drug merchant. "Why, this infernal <i>Jane
  and Elizabeth</i> will spoil the game I've been playing for the last three
  months. The price has dropped a few points already, and the moment she's
  sighted off the Lizard there'll be a slump in the market. Matter, indeed!"
  and he snorted contemptuously.</p>

  <p>The derelict emitted a long, low whistle.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" roared his brother, "you'll whistle for your grub soon, when I'm
  going through the Court."</p>

  <p>The sailor rose and walked slowly up and down the small office. Then
  having opened the baize door and looked out, he shut it carefully and drew
  his chair close to the explosive Josiah.</p>

  <p>"Jos," impressively, "that ship's got to be stopped!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes! What's the use of saying that? Who's to do it?"</p>

  <p>"Name the figure, and I'm the man."</p>

  <p>"You, Sam?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, your 'drunk-on-duty' brother." And as Josiah gasped with the effort
  to realise the situation, Sam continued: "Look here, I know these
  four-masters&mdash;two hundred knots the most you'll get out of them. From
  Barbadoes it's three-and-a-half thousand miles, more or less&mdash;that's a
  good twenty days' sail. When does it say she left? Ah! the first; so she
  can't pass the Lizard before the twentieth, and it's now the eighteenth.
  Well, how much shall we say?"</p>

  <p>"Five hundred pounds?"</p>

  <p>Sam laughed derisively.</p>

  <p>"Say a thousand, then," suggested Josiah with a somewhat injured air.</p>

  <p>"No! ten thousand, and dirt-cheap, too," was the firm reply; and as Josiah
  made a gesture of deprecation, Sam led his trump-card: "Do you think I'm
  going to risk penal servitude for nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Penal servitude!" echoed Josiah faintly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Dartmoor bogs or Portland quarries!" And he chuckled, as Josiah
  visibly shivered. "Of course, if you're afraid, just say so, and there's an
  end of it; but it seems to me as if things had got pretty near the knuckle
  for both of us."</p>

  <p>It was curious to see how exactly the positions of the two brothers had
  become reversed within the last few minutes. The "Napoleon of Finance," as
  the plan was unfolded, had grown palpably limper and flabbier. His brother,
  on the other hand, no longer diffident with the burden of a favour to be
  solicited, towered as it were above him. His back stiffened, as with
  sparkling eye he strode feverishly up and down the little room, the while he
  poured forth his scheme in a flood of technicalities of which Josiah only
  half grasped the meaning.</p>

  <p><a id="pic1"

  </div><br>

  <p>"See, now! This is the river-mouth, with the North Foreland just here;"
  and with a pencil he rapidly sketched a chart of the Thames estuary on the
  newspaper. "She'll likely lie-to for her pilot and a tug in the Downs. Then
  she'll round the Foreland with the flood tide and come up the Edinburgh
  Channel. Here's the Edinburgh Channel&mdash;Edinburgh lightship at one end,
  Black Deep at the other, between the Shingles and the Long Sand. Proper
  course, s'far as I remember just now, is head for Black Deep light, leaving
  the Shingles on the port-hand. There's a beacon on the Shingles during the
  day, and a gas-buoy at night&mdash;gas-buoy flash and dark, what the Trinity
  House men call 'occulting.' Now, the flood tide on the fifteenth will run
  strongest about midnight&mdash;anyhow, that's near enough. Now, suppose that
  it should happen (mind, I only say <i>suppose)</i> that that gas-buoy had
  shifted half a mile south of its berth, when that four-masted hooker was
  about? Well, up she'll come on the top of the tide, and rounding the buoy,
  fetch up hard and fast on the Shingles. If her masts don't go there and then,
  with the flood tide running strong, and the least little bit of a wind from
  the north or nor'-east, it'll be as much as they can do to get the crew off
  before she breaks up, let alone the stuff she's carrying, for all their
  rockets and lifeboats. Well I know that bank!"</p>

  <p>"Was that where you ran ashore before, and&mdash;?" commenced Josiah
  innocently.</p>

  <p>The other turned on him savagely. His mouth was hard and there was a stiff
  look about the "torpedo" beard.</p>

  <p>"You let that alone, now! Maybe I <i>have</i> been starving, and maybe you
  <i>have</i> chucked me a few odd sovereigns during the last year, and perhaps
  you've made me know it, too; but it's my turn now. You can't do without me,
  so you'd best be civil. If I'm to see this thing through, I've got to be
  boss, and don't you forget it! What's more, you've got to find some of the
  ready to go on with.</p>

  <p>"How much do you want?" This very timidly.</p>

  <p>"A fiver for exes, and another to get myself some decent slops, and three
  more of them for a boat."</p>

  <p>Sam fingered the notes with the daintiness of one long a stranger to their
  crisp rustle, then, cramming them into his breast-pocket,
  exclaimed&mdash;</p>

  <p>"As soon as I'm a bit decent, I'm off to Erith to hunt up any ship's
  lifeboat that's going cheap. I'll send you a wire to meet me at Margate
  to-morrow or next day; and if I want any more for exes, you've got to stand
  to it. Now, so long! Show a little pluck, man; and remember," his mouth
  hardened again, "we've got to sink or swim <i>together&mdash;together,</i>
  mind!"</p>

  <p>Josiah's mental faculties had lost some of their poise during the march of
  recent events, but this unwonted phase of his brother's character, the
  shipmaster's resource, its tyranny, its brutality even, did little to restore
  their balance.</p>

  <p>As Sam stood looking at him with a smile which had something of contempt
  in it, his hand resting on the door-knob, Josiah rose stiffly and tried to
  speak.</p>

  <p>"Very well," was all he could find to say in return, and as the door
  closed behind the resuscitated plan of action, he unlocked a spirit-stand and
  helped himself with a trembling hand.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the sailor passed through the outer office, his jaunty air in
  such marked contrast to the diffident and almost timid order of his arrival
  as to cause much wonderment among the clerks. As he clattered down the stairs
  into Mincing Lane, a reminiscence of an old sea-air mingled with the noise of
  the traffic as it floated up through the half-opened window:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">"As I was going up Paradise Street;<br>
  With a heave-ho! Blow the man down!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">THE small crowd of idlers who had stood upon the promenade
  which fronts the pleasant town of Deal, watching the manoeuvres of a small
  lug-rigged boat as it approached the shore, slowly dispersed when the little
  craft, having dropped her mainsail, grounded on the shingle, and her
  occupants leaped out and began to scramble up the steep, shelving beach.</p>

  <p>The passengers were two in number, both elderly men and both distinguished
  by the nautical blue cloth caps which are commonly assumed for some
  unexplained reason by landsmen, even of the most terrestrial type, when they
  visit the neighbourhood of the sea. One of them carried, suspended from his
  forefinger, a string of infant whiting, while the other bore under his arm a
  well-worn naval telescope.</p>

  <p>"Well, Jos," remarked he of the telescope, as the pair reached the summit
  of the beach and turned to gaze out across the Downs, where half-a-dozen
  coasters rode at anchor, "I'm glad to see that if you are a bit of a funker,
  you've at least got a sailor's gizzard. If you couldn't stand a bit of a
  swell, we should be regularly up a tree."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what the deuce you mean by a funker," retorted the other
  sulkily. "Haven't I agreed to do all that you suggest, to risk my life and
  liberty in this accursed venture, and to pay you a fabulous sum for your part
  in it? Funker, indeed!" and he scowled malevolently at the dripping trophies
  of the angle that dangled from his finger.</p>

  <p>"That's all right, old cock," responded the first speaker, whom the astute
  reader has doubtless recognised as our old friend Captain Jenkinson. "Don't
  you get your back up about nothing, but just you attend to my instructions.
  Now, you see, when you want to&mdash;hallo! what's this rounding the point
  there?" and the gallant captain, all on the alert in a moment, pointed his
  telescope at a dark speck enveloped in a cloud of smoke which had just made
  its appearance round the promontory.</p>

  <p>"It's a tug," he remarked after a moment's scrutiny, "and she's got a tow
  rope astern&mdash;and here comes a&mdash;yes, by Jingo! it's a four-masted
  ship&mdash;that's her, Jos, that's our friend right enough."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Josiah doubtfully, "she's not the only four-masted ship
  in the world, is she?"</p>

  <p>"No, I suppose not," growled the captain, "but she's the only one that has
  passed Dungeness. However, we'll stroll down to the end of the pier, and then
  we shall be able to see her make her number. Let me see," he meditated,
  consulting an entry in his pocket-book, "B.T.L.W., I think it is&mdash;yes,
  that's right."</p>

  <p>In half an hour the two vessels had reached the anchorage, the tall,
  stately ship, with her long, grey hull with its white streak and painted
  ports, her lofty masts, her long yards and intricate web of rigging, creeping
  along in the wake of the smoky, bumptious little tug; and just as the pair
  came abreast of Lloyd's station, a string of bright-coloured flags ran up and
  fluttered gaily from the ship's peak.</p>

  <p>"B.T.L.W.," muttered the captain, removing his eyes from the telescope and
  peering triumphantly in his brother's drawn face. "What do you make of her?"
  he continued, addressing a jersey-clad sea-monster who was examining the
  vessel through a pocket-telescope. "She's a large vessel, isn't she? Comes
  from Australia, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>The sea-monster closed his telescope deliberately and regarded the two
  brothers with that air of ineffable and contemptuous condescension which the
  'longshoreman assumes when he addresses a denizen of the land.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," he replied in a hoarse double-bass. "She ain't no Australian.
  She's the <i>Jane and Elizabeth,</i> four thousand tons register, from Buenos
  Ayres, with a cargo of linseed. Got enough linseed aboard of her, she has,
  for to poultice the entire population of Great Britain, sir. She ain't a fast
  ship, sir, d'ye understand&mdash;no, she ain't no clipper; but she's a
  whopper; she can carry some cargo&mdash;Lor'! she <i>can</i> take some stuff
  aboard, to be sure." Here the old man of the sea turned his back upon the two
  conspirators and resumed his telescopic observations.</p>

  <p>"Come along, Jos," said the captain, "let's scoot for the station. There's
  just time for us to catch the five o'clock to Margate."</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">"NOW, I call this very pleasant," said the captain genially,
  as he lolled on the stern locker of his newly purchased boat and gazed at the
  receding harbour and the long jetty, whence came faintly the sound of music
  across the water. "A good dinner inside, a good cigar, a fine, steady breeze
  and a tight, handy boat, not to speak of the prospect of unlimited dibs in
  the immediate future&mdash;what more could a man wish for, eh, Jos?"</p>

  <p>Josiah Jenkinson sat bolt upright on the midship thwart, with an
  expression of the extremest dejection, grasping convulsively the fall of the
  mainsheet.</p>

  <p>"I suppose this boat can be depended upon, Sam?" he asked wearily.</p>

  <p>"Depended on!" explained the captain. "Why, she's got a double teak skin,
  and there's a copper air-case in each of the side lockers. Depended on! I
  tell you, man, she'll do anything but talk."</p>

  <p>"Well, we don't want her to do that," observed Josiah, with a sour
  grin.</p>

  <p>"No, we don't," chuckled Samuel. "By Jingo! what an evening it is! Just
  look at the sunset, my boy," and here the captain in the exuberance of his
  joy trolled forth in a sturdy bass voice&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">"As I was walking down Paradise Street;<br>
  With a heave-ho! Blow the man down!<br>
  I met a young frigate so nice and so neat,<br>
  With a heave-ho! Blow the man down!</p><br>

  <p>"By the way, Jos, as we have a little time to ourselves, we may as well
  rehearse the programme. You see, we're heading north-east, but we're actually
  travelling about north by west on the tide stream; and sailing as we are now,
  we shall make the buoy in about a couple of hours, by which time it'll be
  quite dark. Then we'll commence operations."</p>

  <p>"Just explain to me again what your plan is," said Josiah.</p>

  <p>"Why, you see, the Edinburgh Channel, through which our ship must pass,
  lies between the Long Sand to the north-east and the Shingle sands to the
  south-west. At the east end of the channel is the Edinburgh Channel
  lightship, and about a mile beyond the west end is the Black Deep lightship.
  The actual end of the channel is marked by the north-east Shingles gas-buoy,
  and as soon as the ship has fairly passed that she alters her course to the
  south'ard. Now, don't you see, if we can move that buoy to the south-east,
  our precious hooker will alter her course a trifle too soon and run slap on
  to the north edge of the Shingles, just near the North Beacon; and as she
  will probably run on just about high water flood tide, she won't be likely to
  get off in a hurry."</p>

  <p>"But we can't move the buoy, can we?" protested Josiah.</p>

  <p>"Of course we can't, you chuckle-head!" responded the captain impatiently.
  "Haven't I said so already? But what we can do is to put out her light and
  rig up a little light of our own in humble imitation, and this is how we've
  got to set to work. As soon as we get near the buoy, we take down our
  mainsail, and you work the boat alongside with the oars, and be mighty
  careful you don't bump her against the buoy and get stove in. Then I jump on
  to the buoy and hang on to the cage while I feel about for the gas-pipe, and
  as soon as I have found it I cut through it with this little brass-worker's
  saw and pull the ends apart.</p>

  <p>"Out goes the light, and I hail you to come alongside again and take me
  off&mdash;and mind, while I am at work on the buoy, you keep at least five or
  six lengths away until I hail you, or you will certainly get stove in. Then
  we shall make our first appearance in public in the character of a gas-buoy,
  and please pay great attention to this, as you will probably have to work the
  light while I attend to the management of the boat. As we approach the buoy,
  you must study the character of its light. You will see that it appears to
  suddenly go out at regular intervals, or 'undergo occultation,' as the
  Trinity House people say. This is managed by a small metal screen which drops
  over the light, and is then raised again, by a kind of clockwork. This
  particular buoy has, I find, an occultation lasting two seconds, and the
  light is visible for six; that is to say, you can see the light for six
  seconds at a time, when it disappears for two seconds, then reappears for
  another six seconds, and so on. Now, my inventive genius has evolved a very
  simple arrangement which we may substitute for this complicated clockwork
  mechanism. In the stern locker you will find a common lantern and a still
  commoner chimney-pot hat. Before we dowse the glim of that jolly old buoy we
  shall light our lantern; then, when our friend appears in the offing, while I
  conduct the boat to a suitable spot (she won't want much management, for with
  this breeze she will drift just where I want her to go), you will hold the
  lantern in one hand and the pot-hat in the other. You pop the hat over the
  lantern and the light will be occulted; then you count two seconds and whisk
  off the hat, letting the light shine upon the face of the vasty deep. Count
  six seconds, and then clap on the hat again, and out she goes. Do you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"I understand," replied Josiah drearily.</p>

  <p>"That's right. You clap on the hat, one&mdash;two&mdash;off.
  One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;six&mdash;on.
  One&mdash;two&mdash;off, and so on. Sure you understand?"</p>

  <p>"I understand," reiterated Josiah.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," returned the captain, and he proceeded to light a fresh
  cigar.</p>

  <p>About two hours and a half from the time they left Margate found our two
  philanthropists but a few cables from the Edinburgh Channel lightship, at the
  flashing lantern of which Josiah gazed with the bewildered air of a
  somnambulistic owl, and another twenty minutes' sailing brought the boat
  close alongside the gas-buoy.</p>

  <p>At this new apparition Josiah stared with a feeling of stupefaction; and
  even as he stared, the light vanished as if by magic, but before he had time
  to wonder at its disappearance, there it was again bobbing and jigging about
  like some peculiarly agile will-o'-the-wisp.</p>

  <p>Josiah gazed at the light like one in a dream, and he found himself
  following its vanishings and reappearances
  involuntarily&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;off;
  one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;six&mdash;on&mdash;over
  and over again. Presently he was sharply awakened by the rattle of the
  falling mainsail, as the captain let go the halyards, and then an oar was
  thrust into his hand as his brother called out&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Come, pull yourself together, Jos, and help me to work her alongside the
  buoy, and don't forget what I told you to do; and while I am at work, you
  keep a bright lookout for the <i>Jane and Elizabeth.</i> Remember, the tug
  carries two white lights, one over the other, and you'll see both her
  coloured sidelights at once, and both the side-lights of the ship. Keep a
  good look-out with your glasses, and keep the boat clear of the buoy until
  you hear me call. Now, then, here we are."</p>

  <p>Josiah had a momentary glimpse of a large dark object surmounted by a
  gleaming light, swaying about right over the boat. Then there was a grinding
  noise, and the next moment he saw his brother clinging to the great cage,
  while his voice came hoarsely out of the gloom.</p>

         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Keep the boat clear!"</p>

  <p>Josiah backed a few strokes and then sat down on a thwart, and while the
  boat drifted slowly he watched the light coming and going.</p>

  <p>Soon a rasping sound reached his ear, growing gradually fainter as the
  boat drifted further from the buoy. Still the light kept vanishing and
  reappearing in its strange, disquieting fashion, until at length, after an
  occultation, it failed to appear again, and all around was formless
  gloom.</p>

  <p>The captain's little saw had done its work.</p>

  <p>Seized with a sudden terrible loneliness, Josiah plied the oars
  vigorously. But where was the buoy? In the black darkness nothing was visible
  but the winking light of the Edinburgh lightship and the more slowly repeated
  glare of the Black Deep.</p>

  <p>The terrified merchant wrenched at the oars, shouting aloud his brother's
  name, and peering on all sides into the gloom.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there was a crash, and Josiah, looking round, saw the great dark
  shape, no longer crowned with light, swinging about over the tossing
  boat.</p>

  <p>"Sam!" he shouted. "Sam! aren't you ready to come off?"</p>

  <p>But there was no reply.</p>

  <p>"Sam!" screamed Josiah, trembling and sweating with a horrible dread,
  "what are you doing, Sam?"</p>

  <p>Just then the pale full moon peeped momentarily out of a bank of clouds,
  revealing the painted checkers and the great cage, the bars of which stood
  out black against the dim sky.</p>

  <p><i>There was no one on the buoy.</i></p>

  <p>Josiah slipped off the thwart into the bottom of the boat, where, with his
  fingers twisted in his hair, he lay for a time alternately weeping and
  cursing. The pitching of the boat&mdash;which was kept head to wind and sea
  by her mizzen&mdash;rolled him about on the bottom boards as though he had
  been a half-filled sack, so that presently for very weariness he was fain to
  pull himself up on to a thwart, on which he sat staring moodily and dreamily
  into the darkness.</p>

  <p>To do Josiah justice, he was not greatly affected by the sudden death of
  his brother; indeed, if that ancient mariner could have contrived to effect
  his decease under somewhat more opportune circumstances, it is even possible
  that the event might have been hailed by the "Napoleon of Finance" with some
  degree of relief. But to perish thus ingloriously while the plot was but half
  carried out&mdash;</p>

  <p>Arrived at this point in his meditations, Josiah was recalled abruptly to
  the realities of the situation by a phenomenon the observation of which set
  his heart bounding and his limbs trembling. Away on the eastern horizon there
  had appeared two bright lights like fixed stars, one immediately above the
  other. Just below there was another pair, but side by side, one red and one
  green, while even as he watched them Josiah saw yet another pair of lights,
  also red and green, appear quite close to those he had first noticed.</p>

  <p>The meaning of these lights could not be mistaken by Josiah after the
  captain's repeated explanations. Here, then, he thought, after all his
  trouble and distress, and all the risk he had faced, was this accursed ship
  freighted with ruin and disgrace for him, calmly heading for her destination
  while he sat, an idle spectator, to watch her pass. As he continued thus,
  with his gaze fixed upon the advancing lights, he was suddenly startled b the
  appearance of a tall, dark object which seemed to start out of the gloom and
  creep towards the boat. As it approached and slowly passed close by, he
  perceived that it was a lofty post or column apparently implanted in the
  water and surmounted by a great St. Andrew's cross. The astonishment with
  which he had viewed the apparition now gave place to a very different
  feeling. This strange, uncanny object was evidently the North Beacon of which
  his brother had spoken, and its presence, and the manner in which it had
  apparently swept by the boat, showed that the latter was drifting, as the
  captain had predicted it would, just in the direction in which it was wanted
  to go, and that it was still possible for Josiah to carry out his diabolical
  scheme.</p>

  <p>As soon as he realised this, he commenced to take the necessary steps. The
  lantern was still burning in a box in the stern sheets, and beside it lay the
  hat. Having mixed and consumed a stiff jorum of whisky-and-water to steady
  his quivering nerves, he took up the lantern in one hand and the hat in the
  other, and suddenly held the former up towards the advancing vessels.</p>

  <p>"One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;six&mdash;on!" and
  the hat was slipped on over the light. "One&mdash;two&mdash;off!" and the
  light was once more uncovered.</p>

  <p>"One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;six&mdash;on!" and
  the light was again occulted, to reappear after another two seconds had been
  counted.</p>

  <p>In tins way half an hour was consumed, Josiah's aching arm becoming more
  and more automatic in its action, while his senses became gradually dulled by
  a kind of auto-hypnotism.</p>

  <p>By this time the starboard lights of the two vessels had vanished as the
  broadsides were presented to the boat, and Josiah had been obliged to creep
  round from the starboard side to the port bow to follow them as they passed
  westward. But they were very near now.</p>

  <p>As the tug rolled, the light from her cabin skylights could be seen at
  intervals, and the churning of her paddles was distinctly audible to the
  wrecker in his boat, while from the ship there came down the wind the sound
  of a rollicking chorus mingled with the drone of an accordion. Evidently a
  forecastle concert was in progress.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there was a report like the crack of a rifle, followed
  immediately by a rumbling crash. The chorus and the sound of the accordion
  ceased abruptly and were succeeded by a confused uproar of voices, above
  which could be heard a hollow roar as an officer shouted an order through a
  speaking-trumpet. Josiah crouched, breathless and shaking in the bow of the
  boat, staring at the twinkling lights, which had now begun to move about the
  ship, with a curious mixture of horror and satisfaction. He watched the tug
  round to and run alongside her consort, and presently he saw her port and
  masthead lights creeping away towards the Black Deep lightship. A few minutes
  afterwards the dark sky was rent by a streak of fire as a rocket soared up
  from the stranded ship. While the dull boom of its explosion was yet in his
  ears, and the sparks still floated aloft, the author of all the mischief felt
  his head swimming and his eyes growing dim, and he sank insensible into the
  bottom of the boat.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>

  <p class="first">"AHOY, there!&mdash;anyone aboard that boat?"</p>

  <p>Josiah sat up on the boat's floor, then pulled himself into a kneeling
  position so that his eyes were just above the gunwale.</p>

  <p>A few yards away a small cutter-rigged smack was hove-to while her skipper
  hailed the boat. The dawn had broken grey and cold; a leaden sky hanging over
  a leaden sea, with a faint line of sombre grey far away in the south,
  furnished a prospect that was not inspiriting.</p>

  <p>"Is it far to Margate?" inquired Josiah.</p>

  <p>"Good ten moile," was the encouraging answer.</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"
     name="pic3"></a><br></p>

  <div align="center">

  </div><br>

  <p>"How long will it take me to get there?"</p>

  <p>"How long?" repeated the man, with a faint grin, "why, yer won't never get
  there. You'll drift out to sea and die of starvation. Now look here! I'll tow
  yer right into Margate Harbour for foive barb&mdash;take it or leave it."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Josiah.</p>

  <p>The man clawed at the boat with a long boat-hook and asked&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Will yer stay in the boat or will yer come aboard us?"</p>

  <p>Josiah stood up shivering and looked at the smack. From her grimy chimney
  a cheerful little cloud of blue smoke issued and wandered away to leeward,
  and a man whose head and shoulders protruded through the tiny companion-hatch
  was masticating deliberately, while he grasped in his hand a large blue mug
  containing something that steamed.</p>

  <p>"I'll come aboard of you," said Josiah.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">THE next morning Josiah's breach of his usual punctuality
  was the subject of some remark in the office. Indeed, it was nearly one
  o'clock when, considerably less neat and spruce than usual, he appeared and,
  passing to his room, rang for the senior clerk. Obeying with the morning's
  correspondence, he brought in the last yard unrolled from the tape-machine,
  and on this Josiah pounced with avidity. As the clerk was sorting the papers,
  an exclamation from the broker made him look up. Josiah was much agitated,
  and the tape performed strange gyrations in his hand as he held it out.</p>

  <p>"Have I read this aright, Mr. Sales? What's the name of the ship?"</p>

  <p>"The <i>Jane and Elizabeth</i> from Buenos Ayres passed Gravesend this
  morning," read Sales stolidly.</p>

  <p>"Will you send out for an evening paper?"</p>

  <p>Sales passed through the baize door and despatched a junior for the paper,
  which a boy was already crying in the streets. "Bring two while you're about
  it," he said, in view of Josiah's evident inability to tackle the morning's
  work at present.</p>

  <p>He started to read with a languid interest until on the third page he
  saw&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="headline">SHIP ASHORE OFF MARGATE.<br>
  <i>A Mysterious Sailor.</i><br>
  <br></p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Our Margate correspondent telegraphs: Early this
  morning, in response to signals from the Black Deep lightship, which is
  stationed at the head of the Edinburgh Channel (the usual route for ingoing
  vessels), the Margate lifeboat <i>Quiver</i> proceeded to the Shingles sand,
  when it was found that the American barque <i>White Cloud,</i> laden with
  hides from Rio, was fast ashore on the north edge. The captain and all hands
  were rescued, but all attempts at salvage have been fruitless.</p>

  <p class="newspaper"><i>(Later.)</i></p>

  <p class="newspaper">The <i>White Cloud</i> was in tow at the time of the
  disaster, and when the cable parted from the violent shock with which she
  took the ground, the tug steamed off for assistance. No attempt was made to
  tow the ship off the bank, as it was evident, from the position in which she
  lay, that all efforts with that object would be useless, and it is feared
  that she will soon become a total wreck. It is conjectured that the gas-buoy,
  which was anchored in the fair-way to the north-east of the Shingles, had in
  some way become shifted, so leading the barque on to the sands. It is
  understood that the Trinity House authorities have been communicated
  with.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">The tug, in returning to the scene of the wreck, picked
  up a man swimming near the Shingles in a very exhausted condition. He was at
  first supposed to be one of the crew of the <i>White Cloud,</i> who had
  probably fallen overboard when she grounded with so much force. But on being
  conveyed to the Margate depôt of the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society, he was
  not recognised by any of the rescued men. His underclothing was marked 'S.
  Jenkinson,' and from other indications he is believed to follow the sea. In
  spite of every care and attention, his condition, as a result of the cold and
  exposure he had evidently endured, remained too critical to allow him to
  afford any explanation of his presence in the water. This must, therefore,
  remain a mystery for the present.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>

  <p class="first">LAZILY Sales began to wonder whether there could be any
  possible connection between the half-drowned sailor and his employer's
  brother, when he jumped and dropped the newspaper as a sharp report
  penetrated the baize door. He ran and knocked, but there was no answer; and
  when he tried the handle, the bolt was shot. The added weight of his two
  juniors made the door shiver, and with a more strenuous thrust it gave, and
  the doorway framed their white faces as they paused for the air to clear.
  Then as the smoke rolled into the outer office, Josiah was seen huddled, an
  invertebrate mass, across the desk, a revolver just dropping from his hand. A
  clean-punched hole between the eyes was the source of a little stream,
  splashed in darker red across the pink sheet of the newspaper.</p>

  <p>Josiah had found his pluck at last.</p>
