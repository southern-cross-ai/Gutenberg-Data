     id="chap01">I. THE MAN IN THE LABORATORY</a></h2>

  <p>The room was a small one, and had been chosen for its remoteness from the
  dwelling rooms. It had formed the billiard room, which the former owner of
  Weald Lodge had added to his premises, and John Minute, who had neither the
  time nor the patience for billiards, had readily handed over this damp annex
  to his scientific secretary.</p>

  <p>Along one side ran a plain deal bench which was crowded with glass stills
  and test tubes. In the middle was as plain a table, with half a dozen books,
  a microscope under a glass shade, a little wooden case which was opened to
  display an array of delicate scientific instruments, a Bunsen burner, which
  was burning bluely under a small glass bowl half filled with a dark and
  turgid concoction of some kind.</p>

  <p>The face of the man sitting at the table watching this unsavory stew was
  hidden behind a mica and rubber mask, for the fumes which were being given
  off by the fluid were neither pleasant nor healthy. Save for a shaded light
  upon the table and the blue glow of the Bunsen lamp, the room was in
  darkness. Now and again the student would take a glass rod, dip it for an
  instant into the boiling liquid, and, lifting it, would allow the liquid drop
  by drop to fall from the rod on to a strip of litmus paper. What he saw was
  evidently satisfactory, and presently he turned out the Bunsen lamp, walked
  to the window and opened it, and switched on an electric fan to aid the
  process of ventilation.</p>

  <p>He removed his mask, revealing the face of a good-looking young man,
  rather pale, with a slight dark mustache and heavy, black, wavy hair. He
  closed the window, filled his pipe from the well-worn pouch which he took
  from his pocket, and began to write in a notebook, stopping now and again to
  consult some authority from the books before him.</p>

  <p>In half an hour he had finished this work, had blotted and closed his
  book, and, pushing back his chair, gave himself up to reverie. They were not
  pleasant thoughts to judge by his face. He pulled from his inside pocket a
  leather case and opened it. From this he took a photograph. It was the
  picture of a girl of sixteen. It was a pretty face, a little sad, but
  attractive in its very weakness. He looked at it for a long time, shaking his
  head as at an unpleasant thought.</p>

  <p>There came a gentle tap at the door, and quickly he replaced the
  photograph in his case, folded it, and returned it to his pocket as he rose
  to unlock the door.</p>

  <p>John Minute, who entered, sniffed suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"What beastly smells you have in here, Jasper!" he growled. "Why on earth
  don't they invent chemicals that are more agreeable to the nose?"</p>

  <p>Jasper Cole laughed quietly.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid, sir, that nature has ordered it otherwise," he said.</p>

  <p>"Have you finished?" asked his employer.</p>

  <p>He looked at the still warm bowl of fluid suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"It is all right, sir," said Jasper. "It is only noxious when it is
  boiling. That is why I keep the door locked."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked John Minute, scowling down at the unoffending
  liquor.</p>

  <p>"It is many things," said the other ruefully. "In point of fact, it is an
  experiment. The bowl contains one or two elements which will only mix with
  the others at a certain temperature, and as an experiment it is successful
  because I have kept the unmixable elements in suspension, though the liquid
  has gone cold."</p>

  <p>"I hope you will enjoy your dinner, even though it has gone cold,"
  grumbled John Minute.</p>

  <p>"I didn't hear the bell, sir," said Jasper Cole. "I'm awfully sorry if
  I've kept you waiting."</p>

  <p>They were the only two present in the big, black-looking dining room, and
  dinner was as usual a fairly silent meal. John Minute read the newspapers,
  particularly that portion of them which dealt with the latest fluctuations in
  the stock market.</p>

  <p>"Somebody has been buying Gwelo Deeps," he complained loudly.</p>

  <p>Jasper looked up.</p>

  <p>"Gwelo Deeps?" he said. "But they are the shares&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said the other testily; "I know. They were quoted at a
  shilling last week; they are up to two shillings and threepence. I've got
  five hundred thousand of them; to be exact," he corrected himself, "I've got
  a million of them, though half of them are not my property. I am almost
  tempted to sell."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they have found gold," suggested Jasper.</p>

  <p>John Minute snorted.</p>

  <p>"If there is gold in the Gwelo Deeps there are diamonds on the downs," he
  said scornfully. "By the way, the other five hundred thousand shares belong
  to May."</p>

  <p>Jasper Cole raised his eyebrows as much in interrogation as in
  surprise.</p>

  <p>John Minute leaned back in his chair and manipulated his gold
  toothpick.</p>

  <p>"May Nuttall's father was the best friend I ever had," he said gruffly.
  "He lured me into the Gwelo Deeps against my better judgment We sank a bore
  three thousand feet and found everything except gold."</p>

  <p>He gave one of his brief, rumbling chuckles.</p>

  <p>"I wish that mine had been a success. Poor old Bill Nuttall! He helped me
  in some tight places."</p>

  <p>"And I think you have done your best for his daughter, sir."</p>

  <p>"She's a nice girl," said John Minute, "a dear girl. I'm not taken with
  girls." He made a wry face. "But May is as honest and as sweet as they make
  them. She's the sort of girl who looks you in the eye when she talks to you;
  there's no damned nonsense about May."</p>

  <p>Jasper Cole concealed a smile.</p>

  <p>"What the devil are you grinning at?" demanded John Minute.</p>

  <p>"I also was thinking that there was no nonsense about her," he said.</p>

  <p>John Minute swung round.</p>

  <p>"Jasper," he said, "May is the kind of girl I would like you to marry; in
  fact, she <i>is</i> the girl I would like you to marry."</p>

  <p>"I think Frank would have something to say about that," said the other,
  stirring his coffee.</p>

  <p>"Frank!" snorted John Minute. "What the devil do I care about Frank? Frank
  has to do as he's told. He's a lucky young man and a bit of a rascal, too,
  I'm thinking. Frank would marry anybody with a pretty face. Why, if I hadn't
  interfered&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jasper looked up.</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind," growled John Minute.</p>

  <p>As was his practice, he sat a long time over dinner, half awake and half
  asleep. Jasper had annexed one of the newspapers, and was reading it. This
  was the routine which marked every evening of his life save on those
  occasions when he made a visit to London. He was in the midst of an article
  by a famous scientist on radium emanation, when John Minute continued a
  conversation which he had broken off an hour ago.</p>

  <p>"I'm worried about May sometimes."</p>

  <p>Jasper put down his paper.</p>

  <p>"Worried! Why?"</p>

  <p>"I am worried. Isn't that enough?" growled the other. "I wish you wouldn't
  ask me a lot of questions, Jasper. You irritate me beyond endurance."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll take it that you're worried," said his confidential secretary
  patiently, "and that you've good reason."</p>

  <p>"I feel responsible for her, and I hate responsibilities of all kinds. The
  responsibilities of children&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He winced and changed the subject, nor did he return to it for several
  days.</p>

  <p>Instead he opened up a new line.</p>

  <p>"Sergeant Smith was here when I was out, I understand," he said.</p>

  <p>"He came this afternoon&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>"Did you see him?"</p>

  <p>Jasper nodded.</p>

  <p>"What did he want?"</p>

  <p>"He wanted to see you, as far as I could make out. You were saying the
  other day that he drinks."</p>

  <p>"Drinks!" said the other scornfully. "He doesn't drink; he eats it. What
  do you think about Sergeant Smith?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I think he is a very curious person," said the other frankly, "and I
  can't understand why you go to such trouble to shield him or why you send him
  money every week."</p>

  <p>"One of these days you'll understand," said the other, and his prophecy
  was to be fulfilled. "For the present, it is enough to say that if there are
  two ways out of a difficulty, one of which is unpleasant and one of which is
  less unpleasant, I take the less unpleasant of the two. It is less unpleasant
  to pay Sergeant Smith a weekly stipend than it is to be annoyed, and I should
  most certainly be annoyed if I did not pay him."</p>

  <p>He rose up slowly from the chair and stretched himself.</p>

  <p>"Sergeant Smith," he said again, "is a pretty tough proposition. I know,
  and I have known him for years. In my business, Jasper, I have had to know
  some queer people, and I've had to do some queer things. I am not so sure
  that they would look well in print, though I am not sensitive as to what
  newspapers say about me or I should have been in my grave years ago; but
  Sergeant Smith and his knowledge touches me at a raw place. You are always
  messing about with narcotics and muck of all kinds, and you will understand
  when I tell you that the money I give Sergeant Smith every week serves a
  double purpose. It is an opiate and a prophy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Prophylactic," suggested the other.</p>

  <p>"That's the word," said John Minute. "I was never a whale at the long uns;
  when I was twelve I couldn't write my own name, and when I was nineteen I
  used to spell it with two n's."</p>

  <p>He chuckled again.</p>

  <p>"Opiate and prophylactic," he repeated, nodding his head. "That's Sergeant
  Smith. He is a dangerous devil because he is a rascal."</p>

  <p>"Constable Wiseman&mdash;" began Jasper.</p>

  <p>"Constable Wiseman," snapped John Minute, rubbing his hand through his
  rumpled gray hair, "is a dangerous devil because he's a fool. What has
  Constable Wiseman been here about?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't come here," smiled Jasper. "I met him on the road and had a
  little talk with him."</p>

  <p>"You might have been better employed," said John Minute gruffly. "That
  silly ass has summoned me three times. One of these days I'll get him thrown
  out of the force."</p>

  <p>"He's not a bad sort of fellow," soothed Jasper Cole. "He's rather stupid,
  but otherwise he is a decent, well-conducted man with a sense of the
  law."</p>

  <p>"Did he say anything worth repeating?" asked John Minute.</p>

  <p>"He was saying that Sergeant Smith is a disciplinarian."</p>

  <p>"I know of nobody more of a disciplinarian than Sergeant Smith," said the
  other sarcastically, "particularly when he is getting over a jag. The keenest
  sense of duty is that possessed by a man who has broken the law and has not
  been found out. I think I will go to bed," he added, looking at the clock on
  the mantelpiece. "I am going up to town to-morrow. I want to see May."</p>

  <p>"Is anything worrying you?" asked Jasper.</p>

  <p>"The bank is worrying me," said the old man.</p>

  <p>Jasper Cole looked at him steadily.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with the bank?"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing wrong with the bank, and the knowledge that my dear
  nephew, Frank Merrill, esquire, is accountant at one of its branches removes
  any lingering doubt in my mind as to its stability. And I wish to Heaven
  you'd get out of the habit of asking me 'why' this happens or 'why' I do
  that."</p>

  <p>Jasper lit a cigar before replying:</p>

  <p>"The only way you can find things out in this world is by asking
  questions."</p>

  <p>"Well, ask somebody else," boomed John Minute at the door.</p>

  <p>Jasper took up his paper, but was not to be left to the enjoyment its
  columns offered, for five minutes later John Minute appeared in the doorway,
  minus his tie and coat, having been surprised in the act of undressing with
  an idea which called for development.</p>

  <p>"Send a cable in the morning to the manager of the Gwelo Deeps and ask him
  if there is any report. By the way, you are the secretary of the company. I
  suppose you know that?"</p>

  <p>"Am I?" asked the startled Jasper.</p>

  <p>"Frank was, and I don't suppose he has been doing the work now. You had
  better find out or you will be getting me into a lot of trouble with the
  registrar. We ought to have a board meeting."</p>

  <p>"Am I the directors, too?" asked Jasper innocently.</p>

  <p>"It is very likely," said John Minute. "I know I am chairman, but there
  has never been any need to hold a meeting. You had better find out from Frank
  when the last was held."</p>

  <p>He went away, to reappear a quarter of an hour later, this time in his
  pajamas.</p>

  <p>"That mission May is running," he began, "they are probably short of
  money. You might inquire of their secretary. <i>They</i> will have a
  secretary, I'll be bound! If they want anything send it on to them."</p>

  <p>He walked to the sideboard and mixed himself a whisky and soda.</p>

  <p>"I've been out the last three or four times Smith has called. If he comes
  to-morrow tell him I will see him when I return. Bolt the doors and don't
  leave it to that jackass, Wilkins."</p>

  <p>Jasper nodded.</p>

  <p>"You think I am a little mad, don't you, Jasper?" asked the older man,
  standing by the sideboard with the glass in his hand.</p>

  <p>"That thought has never occurred to me," said Jasper. "I think you are
  eccentric sometimes and inclined to exaggerate the dangers which surround
  you."</p>

  <p>The other shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I shall die a violent death; I know it. When I was in Zululand an old
  witch doctor 'tossed the bones.' You have never had that experience?"</p>

  <p>"I can't say that I have," said Jasper, with a little smile.</p>

  <p>"You can laugh at that sort of thing, but I tell you I've got a great
  faith in it. Once in the king's kraal and once in Echowe it happened, and
  both witch doctors told me the same thing&mdash;that I'd die by violence. I
  didn't use to worry about it very much, but I suppose I'm growing old now,
  and living surrounded by the law, as it were, I am too law-abiding. A
  law-abiding man is one who is afraid of people who are not law-abiding, and I
  am getting to that stage. You laugh at me because I'm jumpy whenever I see a
  stranger hanging around the house, but I have got more enemies to the square
  yard than most people have to the county. I suppose you think I am subject to
  delusions and ought to be put under restraint. A rich man hasn't a very happy
  time," he went on, speaking half to himself and half to the young man. "I've
  met all sorts of people in this country and been introduced as John Minute,
  the millionaire, and do you know what they say as soon as my back is
  turned?"</p>

  <p>Jasper offered no suggestion.</p>

  <p>"They say this," John Minute went on, "whether they're young or old, good,
  bad, or indifferent: 'I wish he'd die and leave me some of his money.'"</p>

  <p>Jasper laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"You haven't a very good opinion of humanity."</p>

  <p>"I have no opinion of humanity," corrected his chief, "and I am going to
  bed."</p>

  <p>Jasper heard his heavy feet upon the stairs and the thud of them overhead.
  He waited for some time; then he heard the bed creak. He closed the windows,
  personally inspected the fastenings of the doors, and went to his little
  office study on the first floor.</p>

  <p>He shut the door, took out the pocket case, and gave one glance at the
  portrait, and then took an unopened letter which had come that evening and
  which, by his deft handling of the mail, he had been able to smuggle into his
  pocket without John Minute's observance.</p>

  <p>He slit open the envelope, extracted the letter, and read:</p>

  <p>DEAR SIR: Your esteemed favor is to hand. We have to thank you for the
  check, and we are very pleased that we have given you satisfactory service.
  The search has been a very long and, I am afraid, a very expensive one to
  yourself, but now that discovery has been made I trust you will feel rewarded
  for your energies.</p>

  <p>The note bore no heading, and was signed "J. B. Fleming."</p>

  <p>Jasper read it carefully, and then, striking a match, lit the paper and
  watched it burn in the grate.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap02"
     id="chap02">II. THE GIRL WHO CRIED</a></h2>

  <p>The northern express had deposited its passengers at King's Cross on time.
  All the station approaches were crowded with hurrying passengers. Taxicabs
  and "growlers" were mixed in apparently inextricable confusion. There was a
  roaring babble of instruction and counter-instruction from police-men, from
  cab drivers, and from excited porters. Some of the passengers hurried swiftly
  across the broad asphalt space and disappeared down the stairs toward the
  underground station. Others waited for unpunctual friends with protesting and
  frequent examination of their watches.</p>

  <p>One alone seemed wholly bewildered by the noise and commotion. She was a
  young girl not more than eighteen, and she struggled with two or three brown
  paper parcels, a hat-box, and a bulky hand-bag. She was among those who
  expected to be met at the station, for she looked helplessly at the clock and
  wandered from one side of the building to the other till at last she came to
  a standstill in the center, put down all her parcels carefully, and, taking a
  letter from a shabby little bag, opened it and read.</p>

  <p>Evidently she saw something which she had not noticed before, for she
  hastily replaced the letter in the bag, scrambled together her parcels, and
  walked swiftly out of the station. Again she came to a halt and looked round
  the darkened courtyard.</p>

  <p>"Here!" snapped a voice irritably. She saw a door of a taxicab open, and
  came toward it timidly.</p>

  <p>"Come in, come in, for heaven's sake!" said the voice.</p>

  <p>She put in her parcels and stepped into the cab. The owner of the voice
  closed the door with a bang, and the taxi moved on.</p>

  <p>"I've been waiting here ten minutes," said the man in the cab.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry, dear, but I didn't read&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course you didn't read," interrupted the other brusquely.</p>

  <p>It was the voice of a young man not in the best of tempers, and the girl,
  folding her hands in her lap, prepared for the tirade which she knew was to
  follow her act of omission.</p>

  <p>"You never seem to be able to do anything right," said the man. "I suppose
  it is your natural stupidity."</p>

  <p>"Why couldn't you meet me inside the station?" she asked with some show of
  spirit.</p>

  <p>"I've told you a dozen times that I don't want to be seen with you," said
  the man brutally. "I've had enough trouble over you already. I wish to Heaven
  I'd never met you."</p>

  <p>The girl could have echoed that wish, but eighteen months of bullying had
  cowed and all but broken her spirit.</p>

  <p>"You are a stone around my neck," said the man bitterly. "I have to hide
  you, and all the time I'm in a fret as to whether you will give me away or
  not. I am going to keep you under my eye now," he said. "You know a little
  too much about me."</p>

  <p>"I should never say a word against you," protested the girl.</p>

  <p>"I hope, for your sake, you don't," was the grim reply.</p>

  <p>The conversation slackened from this moment until the girl plucked up
  courage to ask where they were going.</p>

  <p>"Wait and see," snapped the man, but added later: "You are going to a much
  nicer home than you have ever had in your life, and you ought to be very
  thankful."</p>

  <p>"Indeed I am, dear," said the girl earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Don't call me 'dear,'" snarled her husband.</p>

  <p>The cab took them to Camden Town, and they descended in front of a
  respectable-looking house in a long, dull street. It was too dark for the
  girl to take stock of her surroundings, and she had scarcely time to gather
  her parcels together before the man opened the door and pushed her in.</p>

  <p>The cab drove off, and a motor cyclist who all the time had been following
  the taxi, wheeled his machine slowly from the corner of the street where he
  had waited until he came opposite the house. He let down the supports of his
  machine, went stealthily up the steps, and flashed a lamp upon the enamel
  numbers over the fanlight of the door. He jotted down the figures in a
  notebook, descended the steps again, and, wheeling his machine back a little
  way, mounted and rode off.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later another cab pulled up at the door, and a man descended,
  telling the driver to wait. He mounted the steps, knocked, and after a short
  delay was admitted.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Crawley!" said the man who had opened the door to him. "How goes
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Rotten," said the newcomer. "What do you want me for?"</p>

  <p>His was the voice of an uncultured man, but his tone was that of an
  equal.</p>

  <p>"What do you think I want you for?" asked the other savagely.</p>

  <p>He led the way to the sitting room, struck a match, and lit the gas. His
  bag was on the floor. He picked it up, opened it, and took out a flask of
  whisky which he handed to the other.</p>

  <p>"I thought you might need it," he said sarcastically.</p>

  <p>Crawley took the flask, poured out a stiff tot, and drank it at a gulp. He
  was a man of fifty, dark and dour. His face was lined and tanned as one who
  had lived for many years in a hot climate. This was true of him, for he had
  spent ten years of his life in the Matabeleland mounted police.</p>

  <p>The young man pulled up a chair to the table.</p>

  <p>"I've got an offer to make to you," he said.</p>

  <p>"Is there any money in it?"</p>

  <p>The other laughed.</p>

  <p>"You don't suppose I should make any kind of offer to you that hadn't
  money in it?" he answered contemptuously.</p>

  <p>Crawley, after a moment's hesitation, poured out another drink and gulped
  it down.</p>

  <p>"I haven't had a drink to-day," he said apologetically.</p>

  <p>"That is an obvious lie," said the younger man; "but now to get to
  business. I don't know what your game is in England, but I will tell you what
  mine is. I want a free hand, and I can only have a free hand if you take your
  daughter away out of the country."</p>

  <p>"You want to get rid of her, eh?" asked the other, looking at him
  shrewdly.</p>

  <p>The young man nodded.</p>

  <p>"I tell you, she's a millstone round my neck," he said for the second time
  that evening, "and I am scared of her. At any moment she may do some fool
  thing and ruin me."</p>

  <p>Crawley grinned.</p>

  <p>"'For better or for worse,'" he quoted, and then, seeing the ugly look in
  the other man's face, he said: "Don't try to frighten me, Mr. Brown or Jones,
  or whatever you call yourself, because I can't be frightened. I have had to
  deal with worse men than you and I'm still alive. I'll tell you right now
  that I'm not going out of England. I've got a big game on. What did you think
  of offering me?"</p>

  <p>"A thousand pounds," said the other.</p>

  <p>"I thought it would be something like that," said Crawley coolly. "It is a
  flea-bite to me. You take my tip and find another way of keeping her quiet. A
  clever fellow like you, who knows more about dope than any other man I have
  met, ought to be able to do the trick without any assistance from me. Why,
  didn't you tell me that you knew a drug that sapped the will power of people
  and made them do just as you like? That's the knockout drop to give her. Take
  my tip and try it."</p>

  <p>"You won't accept my offer?" asked the other.</p>

  <p>Crawley shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've got a fortune in my hand if I work my cards right," he said. "I've
  managed to get a position right under the old devil's nose. I see him every
  day, and I have got him scared. What's a thousand pounds to me? I've lost
  more than a thousand on one race at Lewes. No, my boy, employ the resources
  of science," he said flippantly. "There's no sense in being a dope merchant
  if you can't get the right dope for the right case."</p>

  <p>"The less you say about my doping, the better," snarled the other man. "I
  was a fool to take you so much into my confidence."</p>

  <p>"Don't lose your temper," said the other, raising his hand in mock alarm.
  "Lord bless us, Mr. Wright or Robinson, who would have thought that the nice,
  mild-mannered young man who goes to church in Eastbourne could be such a
  fierce chap in London? I've often laughed, seeing you walk past me as though
  butter wouldn't melt in your mouth and everybody saying what a nice young man
  Mr. So-and-so is, and I have thought, if they only knew that this sleek
  lad&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" said the other savagely. "You are getting as much of a danger
  as this infernal girl."</p>

  <p>"You take things too much to heart," said the other. "Now I'll tell you
  what I'll do. I am not going out of England. I am going to keep my present
  menial job. You see, it isn't only the question of money, but I have an idea
  that your old man has got something up his sleeve for me, and the only way to
  prevent unpleasant happenings is to keep close to him."</p>

  <p>"I have told you a dozen times he has nothing against you," said the other
  emphatically. "I know his business, and I have seen most of his private
  papers. If he could have caught you with the goods, he would have had you
  long ago. I told you that the last time you called at the house and I saw
  you. What! Do you think John Minute would pay blackmail if he could get out
  of it? You are a fool!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe I am," said the other philosophically, "but I am not such a fool as
  you think me to be."</p>

  <p>"You had better see her," said his host suddenly.</p>

  <p>Crawley shook his head.</p>

  <p>"A parent's feelings," he protested, "have a sense of decency, Reginald or
  Horace or Hector; I always forget your London name. No," he said, "I won't
  accept your suggestion, but I have got a proposition to make to you, and it
  concerns a certain relative of John Minute&mdash;a nice, young fellow who
  will one day secure the old man's swag."</p>

  <p>"Will he?" said the other between his teeth.</p>

  <p>They sat for two hours discussing the proposition, and then Crawley rose
  to leave.</p>

  <p>"I leave my final jar for the last," he said pleasantly. He had finished
  the contents of the flask, and was in a very amiable frame of mind.</p>

  <p>"You are in some danger, my young friend, and I, your guardian angel, have
  discovered it. You have a valet at one of your numerous addresses."</p>

  <p>"A chauffeur," corrected the other; "a Swede, Jonsen."</p>

  <p>Crawley nodded.</p>

  <p>"I thought he was a Swede."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen him?" asked the other quickly.</p>

  <p>"He came down to make some inquiries in Eastbourne," said Crawley, "and I
  happened to meet him. One of those talkative fellows who opens his heart to a
  uniform. I stopped him from going to the house, so I saved you a
  shock&mdash;if John Minute had been there, I mean."</p>

  <p>The other bit his lips, and his face showed his concern.</p>

  <p>"That's bad," he said. "He has been very restless and rather impertinent
  lately, and has been looking for another job. What did you tell him?"</p>

  <p>"I told him to come down next Wednesday," said Crawley. "I thought you'd
  like to make a few arrangements in the meantime."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand, and the young man, who did not mistake the gesture,
  dived into his pockets with a scowl and handed four five-pound notes into the
  outstretched palm.</p>

  <p>"It will just pay my taxi," said Crawley light-heartedly.</p>

  <p>The other went upstairs. He found the girl sitting where he had left her
  in her bedroom.</p>

  <p>"Clear out of here," he said roughly. "I want the room."</p>

  <p>Meekly she obeyed. He locked the door behind her, lifted a suitcase on to
  the bed, and, opening it, took out a small Japanese box. From this he removed
  a tiny glass pestle and mortar, six little vials, a hypodermic syringe, and a
  small spirit lamp. Then from his pocket he took a cigarette case and removed
  two cigarettes which he laid carefully on the dressing table. He was busy for
  the greater part of the hour.</p>

  <p>As for the girl, she spent that time in the cold dining room huddled up in
  a chair, weeping softly to herself.</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap03"
     id="chap03">III. FOUR IMPORTANT CHARACTERS</a></h2>

  <p>The writer pauses here to say that the story of "The Man Who Knew" is an
  unusual one. It is reconstructed partly from the reports of a certain trial,
  partly from the confidential matter which has come into the writer's hands
  from Saul Arthur Mann and his extraordinary bureau, and partly from the
  private diary which May Nuttall put at the writer's disposal.</p>

  <p>Those practiced readers who begin this narrative with the weary conviction
  that they are merely to see the workings out of a conventional record of
  crime, of love, and of mystery may be urged to pursue their investigations to
  the end. Truth is stranger than fiction, and has need to be, since most
  fiction is founded on truth. There is a strangeness in the story of "The Man
  Who Knew" which brings it into the category of veracious history. It cannot
  be said in truth that any story begins at the beginning of the first chapter,
  since all stories began with the creation of the world, but this present
  story may be said to begin when we cut into the lives of some of the
  characters concerned, upon the seventeenth day of July, 19&mdash;.</p>

  <p>There was a little group of people about the prostrate figure of a man who
  lay upon the sidewalk in Gray Square, Bloomsbury.</p>

  <p>The hour was eight o'clock on a warm summer evening, and that the unusual
  spectacle attracted only a small crowd may be explained by the fact that Gray
  Square is a professional quarter given up to the offices of lawyers,
  surveyors, and corporation offices which at eight o'clock on a summer's day
  are empty of occupants. The unprofessional classes who inhabit the shabby
  streets impinging upon the Euston Road do not include Gray Square in their
  itinerary when they take their evening constitutionals abroad, and even the
  loud children find a less depressing environment for their games.</p>

  <p>The gray-faced youth sprawled upon the pavement was decently dressed and
  was obviously of the superior servant type.</p>

  <p>He was as obviously dead.</p>

  <p>Death, which beautifies and softens the plainest, had failed entirely to
  dissipate the impression of meanness in the face of the stricken man. The
  lips were set in a little sneer, the half-closed eyes were small, the
  clean-shaven jaw was long and underhung, the ears were large and grotesquely
  prominent.</p>

  <p>A constable stood by the body, waiting for the arrival of the ambulance,
  answering in monosyllables the questions of the curious. Ten minutes before
  the ambulance arrived there joined the group a man of middle age.</p>

  <p>He wore the pepper-and-salt suit which distinguishes the country
  excursionist taking the day off in London. He had little side whiskers and a
  heavy brown mustache. His golf cap was new and set at a somewhat rakish angle
  on his head. Across his waistcoat was a large and heavy chain hung at
  intervals with small silver medals. For all his provincial appearance his
  movements were decisive and suggested authority. He elbowed his way through
  the little crowd, and met the constable's disapproving stare without
  faltering.</p>

  <p>"Can I be of any help, mate?" he said, and introduced himself as Police
  Constable Wiseman, of the Sussex constabulary.</p>

  <p>The London constable thawed.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," he said; "you can help me get him into the ambulance when it
  comes."</p>

  <p>"Fit?" asked the newcomer.</p>

  <p>The policeman shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He was seen to stagger and fall, and by the time I arrived he'd snuffed
  out. Heart disease, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Constable Wiseman, regarding the body with a proprietorial and
  professional eye, and retailed his own experiences of similar tragedies, not
  without pride, as though he had to some extent the responsibility for their
  occurrence.</p>

  <p>On the far side of the square a young man and a girl were walking slowly.
  A tall, fair, good-looking youth he was, who might have attracted attention
  even in a crowd. But more likely would that attention have been focused, had
  he been accompanied by the girl at his side, for she was by every standard
  beautiful. They reached the corner of Tabor Street, and it was the fixed and
  eager stare of a little man who stood on the corner of the street and the
  intensity of his gaze which first directed their attention to the tragedy on
  the opposite side of the square.</p>

  <p>The little man who watched was dressed in an ill-fitting frock coat,
  trousers which seemed too long, since they concertinaed over his boots, and a
  glossy silk hat set at the back of his head.</p>

  <p>"What a funny old thing!" said Frank Merrill under his breath, and the
  girl smiled.</p>

  <p>The object of their amusement turned sharply as they came abreast of him.
  His freckled, clean-shaven face looked strangely old, and the big,
  gold-rimmed spectacles bridged halfway down his nose added to his ludicrous
  appearance. He raised his eyebrows and surveyed the two young people.</p>

  <p>"There's an accident over there," he said briefly and without any
  preliminary.</p>

  <p>"Indeed," said the young man politely.</p>

  <p>"There have been several accidents in Gray Square," said the strange old
  man meditatively. "There was one in 1875, when the corner house &mdash;you
  can see the end of it from here&mdash;collapsed and buried fourteen people,
  seven of whom were killed, four of whom were injured for life, and three of
  whom escaped with minor injuries."</p>

  <p>He said this calmly and apparently without any sense that he was acting at
  all unconventionally in volunteering the information, and went on:</p>

  <p>"There was another accident in 1881, on the seventeenth of October, a
  collision between two hansom cabs which resulted in the death of a driver
  whose name was Samuel Green. He lived at 14 Portington Mews, and had a wife
  and nine children."</p>

  <p>The girl looked at the old man with a little apprehension, and Frank
  Merrill laughed.</p>

  <p>"You have a very good memory for this kind of thing. Do you live here?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" The little man shook his head vigorously.</p>

  <p>He was silent for a moment, and then:</p>

  <p>"I think we had better go over and see what it is all about," he said with
  a certain gravity.</p>

  <p>His assumption of leadership was a little staggering, and Frank turned to
  the girl.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head, and the three passed over the road to the little group
  just as the ambulance came jangling into the square. To Merrill's surprise,
  the policeman greeted the little man respectfully, touching his helmet.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid nothing can be done, sir. He is&mdash;gone."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, he's gone!" said the other quite calmly.</p>

  <p>He stooped down, turned back the man's coat, and slipped his hand into the
  inside pocket, but drew blank; the pocket was empty. With an extraordinary
  rapidity of movement, he continued his search, and to the astonishment of
  Frank Merrill the policeman did not deny his right. In the top left-hand
  pocket of the waistcoat he pulled out a crumpled slip which proved to be a
  newspaper clipping.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said the little man. "An advertisement for a manservant cut out of
  this morning's <i>Daily Telegraph</i>; I saw it myself. Evidently a
  manservant who was on his way to interview a new employer. You see: 'Call at
  eight-thirty at Holborn Viaduct Hotel.' He was taking a short cut when his
  illness overcame him. I know who is advertising for the valet," he added
  gratuitously; "he is a Mr. T. Burton, who is a rubber factor from Penang. Mr.
  T. Burton married the daughter of the Reverend George Smith, of Scarborough,
  in 1889, and has four children, one of whom is at Winchester. Hum!"</p>

  <p>He pursed his lips and looked down again at the body; then suddenly he
  turned to Frank Merrill.</p>

  <p>"Do you know this man?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Frank looked at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"No. Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"You were looking at him as though you did," said the little man. "That is
  to say, you were not looking at his face. People who do not look at other
  people's faces under these circumstances know them."</p>

  <p>"Curiously enough," said Frank, with a little smile, "there is some one
  here I know," and he caught the eye of Constable Wiseman.</p>

  <p>That ornament of the Sussex constabulary touched his cap.</p>

  <p>"I thought I recognized you, sir. I have often seen you at Weald Lodge,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>Further conversation was cut short as they lifted the body on to a
  stretcher and put it into the interior of the ambulance. The little group
  watched the white car disappear, and the crowd of idlers began to melt
  away.</p>

  <p>Constable Wiseman took a professional leave of his comrade, and came back
  to Frank a little shyly.</p>

  <p>"You are Mr. Minute's nephew, aren't you, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," said Frank.</p>

  <p>"I used to see you at your uncle's place."</p>

  <p>"Uncle's name?"</p>

  <p>It was the little man's pert but wholly inoffensive inquiry. He seemed to
  ask it as a matter of course and as one who had the right to be answered
  without equivocation.</p>

  <p>Frank Merrill laughed.</p>

  <p>"My uncle is Mr. John Minute," he said, and added, with a faint touch of
  sarcasm: "You probably know him."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," said the other readily. "One of the original Rhodesian pioneers
  who received a concession from Lo Bengula and amassed a large fortune by the
  sale of gold-mining properties which proved to be of no especial value. He
  was tried at Salisbury in 1897 with the murder of two Mashona chiefs, and was
  acquitted. He amassed another fortune in Johannesburg in the boom of '97, and
  came to this country in 1901, settling on a small estate between Polegate and
  Eastbourne. He has one nephew, his heir, Frank Merrill, the son of the late
  Doctor Henry Merrill, who is an accountant in the London and Western Counties
  Bank. He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Frank looked at him in undisguised amazement.</p>

  <p>"You know my uncle?"</p>

  <p>"Never met him in my life," said the little man brusquely. He took off his
  silk hat with a sweep.</p>

  <p>"I wish you good afternoon," he said, and strode rapidly away.</p>

  <p>The uniformed policeman turned a solemn face upon the group.</p>

  <p>"Do you know that gentleman?" asked Frank.</p>

  <p>The constable smiled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, sir; that is Mr. Mann. At the yard we call him 'The Man Who
  Knows!'"</p>

  <p>"Is he a detective?"</p>

  <p>The constable shook his head.</p>

  <p>"From what I understand, sir, he does a lot of work for the commissioner
  and for the government. We have orders never to interfere with him or refuse
  him any information that we can give."</p>

  <p>"The Man Who Knows?" repeated Frank, with a puzzled frown. "What an
  extraordinary person! What does he know?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Everything," said the constable comprehensively.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later Frank was walking slowly toward Holborn.</p>

  <p>"You seem to be rather depressed," smiled the girl.</p>

  <p>"Confound that fellow!" said Frank, breaking his silence. "I wonder how he
  comes to know all about uncle?" He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, dear, this
  is not a very cheery evening for you. I did not bring you out to see
  accidents."</p>

  <p>"Frank," the girl said suddenly, "I seem to know that man's face
  &mdash;the man who was on the pavement, I mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped with a shudder.</p>

  <p>"It seemed a little familiar to me," said Frank thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Didn't he pass us about twenty minutes ago?"</p>

  <p>"He may have done," said Frank, "but I have no particular recollection of
  it. My impression of him goes much farther back than this evening. Now where
  could I have seen him?"</p>

  <p>"Let's talk about something else," she said quickly. "I haven't a very
  long time. What am I to do about your uncle?"</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"I hardly know what to suggest," he said. "I am very fond of Uncle John,
  and I hate to run counter to his wishes, but I am certainly not going to
  allow him to take my love affairs into his hands. I wish to Heaven you had
  never met him!"</p>

  <p>She gave a little gesture of despair.</p>

  <p>"It is no use wishing things like that, Frank. You see, I knew your uncle
  before I knew you. If it had not been for your uncle I should not have met
  you."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what happened," he asked. He looked at his watch. "You had better
  come on to Victoria," he said, "or I shall lose my train."</p>

  <p>He hailed a taxicab, and on the way to the station she told him of all
  that had happened.</p>

  <p>"He was very nice, as he always is, and he said nothing really which was
  very horrid about you. He merely said he did not want me to marry you because
  he did not think you'd make a suitable husband. He said that Jasper had all
  the qualities and most of the virtues."</p>

  <p>Frank frowned.</p>

  <p>"Jasper is a sleek brute," he said viciously.</p>

  <p>She laid her hand on his arm.</p>

  <p>"Please be patient," she said. "Jasper has said nothing whatever to me and
  has never been anything but most polite and kind."</p>

  <p>"I know that variety of kindness," growled the young man. "He is one of
  those sly, soft-footed sneaks you can never get to the bottom of. He is
  worming his way into my uncle's confidence to an extraordinary extent. Why,
  he is more like a son to Uncle John than a beastly secretary."</p>

  <p>"He has made himself necessary," said the girl, "and that is halfway to
  making yourself wealthy."</p>

  <p>The little frown vanished from Frank's brow, and he chuckled.</p>

  <p>"That is almost an epigram," he said. "What did you tell uncle?"</p>

  <p>"I told him that I did not think that his suggestion was possible and that
  I did not care for Mr. Cole, nor he for me. You see, Frank, I owe your Uncle
  John so much. I am the daughter of one of his best friends, and since dear
  daddy died Uncle John has looked after me. He has given me my
  education&mdash;my income&mdash;my everything; he has been a second father to
  me."</p>

  <p>Frank nodded.</p>

  <p>"I recognize all the difficulties," he said, "and here we are at
  Victoria."</p>

  <p>She stood on the platform and watched the train pull out and waved her
  hand in farewell, and then returned to the pretty flat in which John Minute
  had installed her. As she said, her life had been made very smooth for her.
  There was no need for her to worry about money, and she was able to devote
  her days to the work she loved best. The East End Provident Society, of which
  she was president, was wholly financed by the Rhodesian millionaire.</p>

  <p>May had a natural aptitude for charity work. She was an indefatigable
  worker, and there was no better known figure in the poor streets adjoining
  the West Indian Docks than Sister Nuttall. Frank was interested in the work
  without being enthusiastic. He had all the man's apprehension of infectious
  disease and of the inadvisability of a beautiful girl slumming without
  attendance, but the one visit he had made to the East End in her company had
  convinced him that there was no fear as to her personal safety.</p>

  <p>He was wont to grumble that she was more interested in her work than she
  was in him, which was probably true, because her development had been a slow
  one, and it could not be said that she was greatly in love with anything in
  the world save her self-imposed mission.</p>

  <p>She ate her frugal dinner, and drove down to the mission headquarters off
  the Albert Dock Road. Three nights a week were devoted by the mission to
  visitation work. Many women and girls living in this area spend their days at
  factories in the neighborhood, and they have only the evenings for the
  treatment of ailments which, in people better circumstanced, would produce
  the attendance of specialists. For the night work the nurses were accompanied
  by a volunteer male escort. May Nuttall's duties carried her that evening to
  Silvertown and to a network of mean streets to the east of the railway. Her
  work began at dusk, and was not ended until night had fallen and the stars
  were quivering in a hot sky.</p>

  <p>The heat was stifling, and as she came out of the last foul dwelling she
  welcomed as a relief even the vitiated air of the hot night. She went back
  into the passageway of the house, and by the light of a paraffin lamp made
  her last entry in the little diary she carried.</p>

  <p>"That makes eight we have seen, Thompson," she said to her escort. "Is
  there anybody else on the list?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody else to-night, miss," said the young man, concealing a yawn.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it is not very interesting for you, Thompson," said the girl
  sympathetically; "you haven't even the excitement of work. It must be awfully
  dull standing outside waiting for me."</p>

  <p>"Bless you, miss," said the man. "I don't mind at all. If it is good
  enough for you to come into these streets, it is good enough for me to go
  round with you."</p>

  <p>They stood in a little courtyard, a cul-de-sac cut off at one end by a
  sheer wall, and as the girl put back her diary into her little net bag a man
  came swiftly down from the street entrance of the court and passed her. As he
  did so the dim light of the lamp showed for a second his face, and her mouth
  formed an "O" of astonishment. She watched him until he disappeared into one
  of the dark doorways at the farther end of the court, and stood staring at
  the door as though unable to believe her eyes.</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking the pale face and the straight figure of Jasper
  Cole, John Minute's secretary.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap04"
     id="chap04">IV. THE ACCOUNTANT AT THE BANK</a></h2>

  <p>May Nuttall expressed her perplexity in a letter:</p>

  <p>DEAR FRANK: Such a remarkable thing happened last night. I was in Silvers
  Rents about eleven o'clock, and had just finished seeing the last of my
  patients, when a man passed me and entered one of the houses&mdash;it was, I
  thought at the time, either the last or the last but one on the left. I now
  know that it was the last but one. There is no doubt at all in my mind that
  it was Mr. Cole, for not only did I see his face, but he carried the
  snakewood cane which he always affects.</p>

  <p>I must confess I was curious enough to make inquiries, and I found that he
  is a frequent visitor here, but nobody quite knows why he comes. The last
  house is occupied by two families, very uninteresting people, and the last
  house but one is empty save for a room which is apparently the one Mr. Cole
  uses. None of the people in the Rents know Mr. Cole or have ever seen him.
  Apparently the downstairs room in the empty house is kept locked, and a woman
  who lives opposite told my informant, Thompson, whom you will remember as the
  man who always goes with me when I am slumming, that the gentleman sometimes
  comes, uses this room, and that he always sweeps it out for himself. It
  cannot be very well furnished, and apparently he never stays the night
  there.</p>

  <p>Isn't it very extraordinary? Please tell me what you make of it
  &mdash;</p>

  <p>Frank Merrill put down the letter and slowly filled his pipe. He was
  puzzled, and found no solution either then or on his way to the office.</p>

  <p>He was the accountant of the Piccadilly branch of the London and Western
  Counties Bank, and had very little time to give to outside problems. But the
  thought of Cole and his curious appearance in a London slum under
  circumstances which, to say the least, were mysterious came between him and
  his work more than once.</p>

  <p>He was entering up some transactions when he was sent for by the manager.
  Frank Merrill, though he did not occupy a particularly imposing post in the
  bank, held nevertheless a very extraordinary position and one which insured
  for him more consideration than the average official receives at the hands of
  his superiors. His uncle was financially interested in the bank, and it was
  generally believed that Frank had been sent as much to watch his relative's
  interests as to prepare himself for the handling of the great fortune which
  John Minute would some day leave to his heir.</p>

  <p>The manager nodded cheerily as Frank came in and closed the door behind
  him.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Merrill," said the chief. "I want to see you about Mr.
  Holland's account. You told me he was in the other day."</p>

  <p>Frank nodded.</p>

  <p>"He came in in the lunch hour."</p>

  <p>"I wish I had been here," said the manager thoughtfully. "I would like to
  see this gentleman."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything wrong with his account?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," said the manager with a smile; "he has a very good balance. In
  fact, too large a balance for a floating account. I wish you would see him
  and persuade him to put some of this money on deposit. The head office does
  not like big floating balances which may be withdrawn at any moment and which
  necessitates the keeping here of a larger quantity of cash than I care to
  hold.</p>

  <p>"Personally," he went on, "I do not like our method of doing business at
  all. Our head office being in Plymouth, it is necessary, by the peculiar
  rules of the bank, that the floating balances should be so covered, and I
  confess that your uncle is as great a sinner as any. Look at this?"</p>

  <p>He pushed a check across the table.</p>

  <p>"Here's a bearer check for sixty thousand pounds which has just come in.
  It is to pay the remainder of the purchase price due to Consolidated Mines.
  Why they cannot accept the ordinary crossed check Heavens knows!"</p>

  <p>Frank looked at the sprawling signature and smiled.</p>

  <p>"You see, uncle's got a reputation to keep up," he said good- humoredly;
  "one is not called 'Ready-Money Minute' for nothing."</p>

  <p>The manager made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"That sort of thing may be necessary in South Africa," he said, "but here
  in the very heart of the money world cash payments are a form of lunacy. I do
  not want you to repeat this to your relative."</p>

  <p>"I am hardly likely to do that," said Frank, "though I do think you ought
  to allow something for uncle's peculiar experiences in the early days of his
  career."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I make every allowance," said the other; "only it is very
  inconvenient, but it was not to discuss your uncle's shortcomings that I
  brought you here."</p>

  <p>He pulled out a pass book from a heap in front of him.</p>

  <p>"'Mr. Rex Holland,'" he read. "He opened his account while I was on my
  holiday, you remember."</p>

  <p>"I remember very well," said Frank, "and he opened it through me."</p>

  <p>"What sort of man is he?" asked the manager.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I am no good at descriptions," replied Frank, "but I should
  describe him as a typical young man about town, not very brainy, very few
  ideas outside of his own immediate world&mdash;which begins at Hyde Park
  Corner&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And ends at the Hippodrome," interrupted the manager.</p>

  <p>"Possibly," said Frank. "He seemed a very sound, capable man in spite of a
  certain languid assumption of ignorance as to financial matters, and he came
  very well recommended. What would you like me to do?"</p>

  <p>The manager pushed himself back in his chair, thrust his hands in his
  trousers' pockets, and looked at the ceiling for inspiration.</p>

  <p>"Suppose you go along and see him this afternoon and ask him as a favor to
  put some of his money on deposit. We will pay the usual interest and all that
  sort of thing. You can explain that he can get the money back whenever he
  wants it by giving us thirty days' notice. Will you do this for me?"</p>

  <p>"Surely," said Frank heartily. "I will see him this afternoon. What is his
  address? I have forgotten."</p>

  <p>"Albemarle Chambers, Knightsbridge," replied the manager. "He may be in
  town."</p>

  <p>"And what is his balance?" asked Frank.</p>

  <p>"Thirty-seven thousand pounds," said the other, "and as he is not buying
  Consolidated Mines I do not see what need he has for the money, the more so
  since we can always give him an overdraft on the security of his deposit.
  Suggest to him that he puts thirty thousand pounds with us and leaves seven
  thousand pounds floating. By the way, your uncle is sending his secretary
  here this afternoon to go into the question of his own account."</p>

  <p>Frank looked up.</p>

  <p>"Cole," he said quickly, "is he coming here? By Jove!"</p>

  <p>He stood by the manager's desk, and a look of amusement came into his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I want to ask Cole something," he said slowly. "What time do you expect
  him?"</p>

  <p>"About four o'clock."</p>

  <p>"After the bank closes?"</p>

  <p>The manager nodded.</p>

  <p>"Uncle has a weird way of doing business," said Frank, after a pause. "I
  suppose that means that I shall have to stay on?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't necessary," said Mr. Brandon. "You see Mr. Cole is one of our
  directors."</p>

  <p>Frank checked an exclamation of surprise.</p>

  <p>"How long has this been?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Since last Monday. I thought I told you. At any rate, if you have not
  been told by your uncle, you had better pretend to know nothing about it,"
  said Brandon hastily.</p>

  <p>"You may be sure I shall keep my counsel," said Frank, a little amused by
  the other's anxiety. "You have been very good to me, Mr. Brandon, and I
  appreciate your kindness."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Cole is a nominee of your uncle, of course," Brandon went on, with a
  little nod of acknowledgment for the other's thanks. "Your uncle makes a
  point of never sitting on boards if he can help it, and has never been
  represented except by his solicitor since he acquired so large an interest in
  the bank. As a matter of fact, I think Mr. Cole is coming here as much to
  examine the affairs of the branch as to look after your uncle's account. Cole
  is a very first-class man of business, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>Frank's answer was a grim smile.</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" he said dryly. "He has the scientific mind grafted to a
  singular business capacity."</p>

  <p>"You don't like him?"</p>

  <p>"I have no particular reason for not liking him," said the other.
  "Possibly I am being constitutionally uncharitable. He is not the type of man
  I greatly care for. He possesses all the virtues, according to uncle, spends
  his days and nights almost slavishly working for his employer. Oh, yes, I
  know what you are going to say; that is a very fine quality in a young man,
  and honestly I agree with you, only it doesn't seem natural. I don't suppose
  anybody works as hard as I or takes as much interest in his work, yet I have
  no particular anxiety to carry it on after business hours."</p>

  <p>The manager rose.</p>

  <p>"You are not even an idle apprentice," he said good-humoredly. "You will
  see Mr. Rex Holland for me?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Frank, and went back to his desk deep in thought.</p>

  <p>It was four o'clock to the minute when Jasper Cole passed through the one
  open door of the bank at which the porter stood ready to close. He was well,
  but neatly, dressed, and had hooked to his wrist a thin snakewood cane
  attached to a crook handle.</p>

  <p>He saw Frank across the counter and smiled, displaying two rows of even,
  white teeth.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Jasper!" said Frank easily, extending his hand. "How is
  uncle?"</p>

  <p>"He is very well indeed," replied the other. "Of course he is very worried
  about things, but then I think he is always worried about something or
  other."</p>

  <p>"Anything in particular?" asked Frank interestedly.</p>

  <p>Jasper shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You know him much better than I; you were with him longer. He is getting
  so horribly suspicious of people, and sees a spy or an enemy in every strange
  face. That is usually a bad sign, but I think he has been a little
  overwrought lately."</p>

  <p>He spoke easily; his voice was low and modulated with the faintest
  suggestion of a drawl, which was especially irritating to Frank, who secretly
  despised the Oxford product, though he admitted&mdash;since he was a very
  well-balanced and on the whole good-humored young man&mdash;his dislike was
  unreasonable.</p>

  <p>"I hear you have come to audit the accounts," said Frank, leaning on the
  counter and opening his gold cigarette case.</p>

  <p>"Hardly that," drawled Jasper.</p>

  <p>He reached out his hand and selected a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I just want to sort out a few things. By the way, your uncle had a letter
  from a friend of yours."</p>

  <p>"Mine?"</p>

  <p>"A Rex Holland," said the other.</p>

  <p>"He is hardly a friend of mine; in fact, he is rather an infernal
  nuisance," said Frank. "I went down to Knightsbridge to see him to-day, and
  he was out. What has Mr. Holland to say?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he is interested in some sort of charity, and he is starting a guinea
  collection. I forget what the charity was."</p>

  <p>"Why do you call him a friend of mine?" asked Frank, eying the other
  keenly.</p>

  <p>Jasper Cole was halfway to the manager's office and turned.</p>

  <p>"A little joke," he said. "I had heard you mention the gentleman. I have
  no other reason for supposing he was a friend of yours."</p>

  <p>"Oh, by the way, Cole," said Frank suddenly, "were you in town last
  night?"</p>

  <p>Jasper Cole shot a swift glance at him.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Were you near Victoria Docks?"</p>

  <p>"What a question to ask!" said the other, with his inscrutable smile, and,
  turning abruptly, walked in to the waiting Mr. Brandon.</p>

  <p>Frank finished work at five-thirty that night and left Jasper Cole and a
  junior clerk to the congenial task of checking the securities. At nine
  o'clock the clerk went home, leaving Jasper alone in the bank. Mr. Brandon,
  the manager, was a bachelor and occupied a flat above the bank premises. From
  time to time he strode in, his big pipe in the corner of his mouth. The last
  of these occasions was when Jasper Cole had replaced the last ledger in Mr.
  Minute's private safe.</p>

  <p>"Half past eleven," said the manager disapprovingly, "and you have had no
  dinner."</p>

  <p>"I can afford to miss a dinner," laughed the other.</p>

  <p>"Lucky man," said the manager.</p>

  <p>Jasper Cole passed out into the street and called a passing taxi to the
  curb.</p>

  <p>"Charing Cross Station," he said.</p>

  <p>He dismissed the cab in the station courtyard, and after a while walked
  back to the Strand and hailed another.</p>

  <p>"Victoria Dock Road," he said in a low voice.</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap05"
     id="chap05">V. JOHN MINUTE'S LEGACY</a></h2>

  <p>La Rochefoucauld has said that prudence and love are inconsistent. May
  Nuttall, who had never explored the philosophies of La Rochefoucauld, had
  nevertheless seen that quotation in the birthday book of an acquaintance, and
  the saying had made a great impression upon her. She was twenty-one years of
  age, at which age girls are most impressionable and are little influenced by
  the workings of pure reason. They are prepared to take their philosophies
  ready-made, and not disinclined to accept from others certain rigid standards
  by which they measure their own elastic temperaments.</p>

  <p>Frank Merrill was at once a comfort and the cause of a certain half-
  ashamed resentment, since she was of the age which resents dependence. The
  woman who spends any appreciable time in the discussion with herself as to
  whether she does or does not love a man can only have her doubts set at rest
  by the discovery of somebody whom she loves better. She liked Frank, and
  liked him well enough to accept the little ring which marked the beginning of
  a new relationship which was not exactly an engagement, yet brought to her
  friendship a glamour which it had never before possessed.</p>

  <p>She liked him well enough to want his love. She loved him little enough to
  find the prospect of an early marriage alarming. That she did not understand
  herself was not remarkable. Twenty-one has not the experience by which the
  complexities of twenty-one may be straightened out and made visible.</p>

  <p>She sat at breakfast, puzzling the matter out, and was a little disturbed
  and even distressed to find, in contrasting the men, that of the two she had
  a warmer and a deeper feeling for Jasper Cole. Her alarm was due to the
  recollection of one of Frank's warnings, almost prophetic, it seemed to her
  now:</p>

  <p>"That man has a fascination which I would be the last to deny. I find
  myself liking him, though my instinct tells me he is the worst enemy I have
  in the world."</p>

  <p>If her attitude toward Frank was difficult to define, more remarkable was
  her attitude of mind toward Jasper Cole. There was something
  sinister&mdash;no, that was not the word&mdash;something "frightening" about
  him. He had a magnetism, an aura of personal power, which seemed to paralyze
  the will of any who came into conflict with him.</p>

  <p>She remembered how often she had gone to the big library at Weald Lodge
  with the firm intention of "having it out with Jasper." Sometimes it was a
  question of domestic economy into which he had obtruded his views &mdash;when
  she was sixteen she was practically housekeeper to her adopted
  uncle&mdash;perhaps it was a matter of carriage arrangement. Once it had been
  much more serious, for after she had fixed up to go with a merry picnic party
  to the downs, Jasper, in her uncle's absence and on his authority, had firmly
  but gently forbidden her attendance. Was it an accident that Frank Merrill
  was one of the party, and that he was coming down from London for an
  afternoon's fun?</p>

  <p>In this case, as in every other, Jasper had his way. He even convinced her
  that his view was right and hers was wrong. He had pooh- poohed on this
  occasion all suggestion that it was the presence of Frank Merrill which had
  induced him to exercise the veto which his extraordinary position gave to
  him. According to his version, it had been the inclusion in the party of two
  ladies whose names were famous in the theatrical world which had raised his
  delicate gorge.</p>

  <p>May thought of this particular incident as she sat at breakfast, and with
  a feeling of exasperation she realized that whenever Jasper had set his foot
  down he had never been short of a plausible reason for opposing her.</p>

  <p>For one thing, however, she gave him credit. Never once had he spoken
  depreciatingly of Frank.</p>

  <p>She wondered what business brought Jasper to such an unsavory neighborhood
  as that in which she had seen him. She had all a woman's curiosity without a
  woman's suspicions, and, strangely enough, she did not associate his presence
  in this terrible neighborhood or his mysterious comings and goings with
  anything discreditable to himself. She thought it was a little eccentric in
  him, and wondered whether he, too, was running a "little mission" of his own,
  but dismissed that idea since she had received no confirmation of the theory
  from the people with whom she came into contact in that neighborhood.</p>

  <p>She was halfway through her breakfast when the telephone bell rang, and
  she rose from the table and crossed to the wall. At the first word from the
  caller she recognized him.</p>

  <p>"Why, uncle!" she said. "Whatever are you doing in town?"</p>

  <p>The voice of John Minute bellowed through the receiver:</p>

  <p>"I've an important engagement. Will you lunch with me at one-thirty at the
  Savoy?"</p>

  <p>He scarcely waited for her to accept the invitation before he hung up his
  receiver.</p>

  <p>The commissioner of police replaced the book which he had taken from the
  shelf at the side of his desk, swung round in his chair, and smiled
  quizzically at the perturbed and irascible visitor.</p>

  <p>The man who sat at the other side of the desk might have been fifty- five.
  He was of middle height, and was dressed in a somewhat violent check suit,
  the fit of which advertised the skill of the great tailor who had ably
  fashioned so fine a creation from so unlovely a pattern.</p>

  <p>He wore a low collar which would have displayed a massive neck but for the
  fact that a glaring purple cravat and a diamond as big as a hazelnut directed
  the observer's attention elsewhere. The face was an unusual one. Strong to a
  point of coarseness, the bulbous nose, the thick, irregular lips, the massive
  chin all spoke of the hard life which John Minute had spent. His eyes were
  blue and cold, his hair a thick and unruly mop of gray. At a distance he
  conveyed a curious illusion of refinement. Nearer at hand, his pink face
  repelled one by its crudities. He reminded the commissioner of a piece of
  scene painting that pleased from the gallery and disappointed from the
  boxes.</p>

  <p>"You see, Mr. Minute," said Sir George suavely, "we are rather limited in
  our opportunities and in our powers. Personally, I should be most happy to
  help you, not only because it is my business to help everybody, but because
  you were so kind to my boy in South Africa; the letters of introduction you
  gave to him were most helpful."</p>

  <p>The commissioner's son had been on a hunting trip through Rhodesia and
  Barotseland, and a chance meeting at a dinner party with the Rhodesian
  millionaire had produced these letters.</p>

  <p>"But," continued the official, with a little gesture of despair, "Scotland
  Yard has its limitations. We cannot investigate the cause of intangible
  fears. If you are threatened we can help you, but the mere fact that you
  fancy there is come sort of vague danger would not justify our taking any
  action."</p>

  <p>John Minute hitched about in his chair.</p>

  <p>"What are the police for?" he asked impatiently. "I have enemies, Sir
  George. I took a quiet little place in the country, just outside Eastbourne,
  to get away from London, and all sorts of new people are prying round us.
  There was a new parson called the other day for a subscription to some boy
  scouts' movement or other. He has been hanging round my place for a month,
  and lives at a cottage near Polegate. Why should he have come to
  Eastbourne?"</p>

  <p>"On a holiday trip?" suggested the commissioner.</p>

  <p>"Bah!" said John Minute contemptuously. "There's some other reason. I've
  had him watched. He goes every day to visit a woman at a hotel &mdash;a
  confederate. They're never seen in public together. Then there's a peddler,
  one of those fellows who sell glass and repair windows; nobody knows anything
  about him. He doesn't do enough business to keep a fly alive. He's always
  hanging round Weald Lodge. Then there's a Miss Paines, who says she's a
  landscape gardener, and wants to lay out the grounds in some newfangled way.
  I sent her packing about her business, but she hasn't left the
  neighborhood."</p>

  <p>"Have you reported the matter to the local police?" asked the
  commissioner.</p>

  <p>Minute nodded.</p>

  <p>"And they know nothing suspicious about them?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing!" said Mr. Minute briefly.</p>

  <p>"Then," said the other, smiling, "there is probably nothing known against
  them, and they are quite innocent people trying to get a living. After all,
  Mr. Minute, a man who is as rich as you are must expect to attract a number
  of people, each trying to secure some of your wealth in a more or less
  legitimate way. I suspect nothing more remarkable than this has
  happened."</p>

  <p>He leaned back in his chair, his hands clasped, a sudden frown on his
  face.</p>

  <p>"I hate to suggest that anybody knows any more than we, but as you are so
  worried I will put you in touch with a man who will probably relieve your
  anxiety."</p>

  <p>Minute looked up.</p>

  <p>"A police officer?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Sir George shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, this is a private detective. He can do things for you which we
  cannot. Have you ever heard of Saul Arthur Mann? I see you haven't. Saul
  Arthur Mann," said the commissioner, "has been a good friend of ours, and
  possibly in recommending him to you I may be a good friend to both of you. He
  is 'The Man Who Knows.'"</p>

  <p>"'The Man Who Knows,'" repeated Mr. Minute dubiously. "What does he
  know?"</p>

  <p>"I'll show you," said the commissioner. He went to the telephone, gave a
  number, and while he was waiting for the call to be put through he asked:
  "What is the name of your boy-scout parson?"</p>

  <p>"The Reverend Vincent Lock," replied Mr. Minute.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you don't know the name of your glass peddler?"</p>

  <p>Minute shook his head.</p>

  <p>"They call him 'Waxy' in the village," he said.</p>

  <p>"And the lady's name is Miss Paines, I think?" asked the commissioner,
  jotting down the names as he repeated them. "Well, we shall &mdash;Hello! Is
  that Saul Arthur Mann? This is Sir George Fuller. Connect me with Mr. Mann,
  will you?"</p>

  <p>He waited a second, and then continued:</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Mr. Mann? I want to ask you something. Will you note these
  three names? The Reverend Vincent Lock, a peddling glazier who is known as
  'Waxy,' and a Miss Paines. Have you got them? I wish you would let me know
  something about them."</p>

  <p>Mr. Minute rose.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you'll let me know, Sir George&mdash;" he began, holding out his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Don't go yet," replied the commissioner, waving him to his chair again.
  "You will obtain all the information you want in a few minutes."</p>

  <p>"But surely he must make inquiries," said the other, surprised.</p>

  <p>Sir George shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The curious thing about Saul Arthur Mann is that he never has to make
  inquiries. That is why he is called 'The Man Who Knows.' He is one of the
  most remarkable people in the world of criminal investigation," he went on.
  "We tried to induce him to come to Scotland Yard. I am not so sure that the
  government would have paid him his price. At any rate, he saved me any
  embarrassment by refusing point-blank."</p>

  <p>The telephone bell rang at that moment, and Sir George lifted the
  receiver. He took a pencil and wrote rapidly on his pad, and when he had
  finished he said, "Thank you," and hung up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Here is your information, Mr. Minute," he said. "The Reverend Vincent
  Lock, curate in a very poor neighborhood near Manchester, interested in the
  boy scouts' movement. His brother, George Henry Locke, has had some domestic
  trouble, his wife running away from him. She is now staying at the Grand
  Hotel, Eastbourne, and is visited every day by her brother-in-law, who is
  endeavoring to induce her to return to her home. That disposes of the
  reverend gentleman and his confederate. Miss Paines is a genuine landscape
  gardener, has been the plaintiff in two breach-of- promise cases, one of
  which came to the court. There is no doubt," the commissioner went on reading
  the paper, "that her <i>modus operandi</i> is to get elderly gentlemen to
  propose marriage and then to commence her action. That disposes of Miss
  Paines, and you now know why she is worrying you. Our friend 'Waxy' has
  another name&mdash;Thomas Cobbler&mdash;and he has been three times convicted
  of larceny."</p>

  <p>The commissioner looked up with a grim little smile.</p>

  <p>"I shall have something to say to our own record department for failing to
  trace 'Waxy,'" he said, and then resumed his reading.</p>

  <p>"And that is everything! It disposes of our three," he said. "I will see
  that 'Waxy' does not annoy you any more."</p>

  <p>"But how the dickens&mdash;" began Mr. Minute. "How the dickens does this
  fellow find out in so short a time?"</p>

  <p>The commissioner shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"He just knows," he said.</p>

  <p>He took leave of his visitor at the door.</p>

  <p>"If you are bothered any more," he said, "I should strongly advise you to
  go to Saul Arthur Mann. I don't know what your real trouble is, and you
  haven't told me exactly why you should fear an attack of any kind. You won't
  have to tell Mr. Mann," he said with a little twinkle in his eye.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked the other suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Because he will know," said the commissioner.</p>

  <p>"The devil he will!" growled John Minute, and stumped down the broad
  stairs on to the Embankment, a greatly mystified man. He would have gone off
  to seek an interview with this strange individual there and then, for his
  curiosity was piqued and he had also a little apprehension, one which, in his
  impatient way, he desired should be allayed, but he remembered that he had
  asked May to lunch with him, and he was already five minutes late.</p>

  <p>He found the girl in the broad vestibule, waiting for him, and greeted her
  affectionately.</p>

  <p>Whatever may be said of John Minute that is not wholly to his credit, it
  cannot be said that he lacked sincerity.</p>

  <p>There are people in Rhodesia who speak of him without love. They describe
  him as the greatest land thief that ever rode a Zeedersburg coach from Port
  Charter to Salisbury to register land that he had obtained by trickery. They
  tell stories of those wonderful coach drives of his with relays of twelve
  mules waiting every ten miles. They speak of his gambling propensities, of
  ten-thousand-acre farms that changed hands at the turn of a card, and there
  are stories that are less printable. When M'Lupi, a little Mashona chief,
  found gold in '92, and refused to locate the reef, it was John Minute who
  staked him out and lit a grass fire on his chest until he spoke.</p>

  <p>Many of the stories are probably exaggerated, but all Rhodesia agrees that
  John Minute robbed impartially friend and foe. The confidant of Lo'Ben and
  the Company alike, he betrayed both, and on that terrible day when it was a
  toss of a coin whether the concession seekers would be butchered in Lo'Ben's
  kraal, John Minute escaped with the only available span of mules and left his
  comrades to their fate.</p>

  <p>Yet he had big, generous traits, and could on occasions be a tender and a
  kindly friend. He had married when a young man, and had taken his wife into
  the wilds.</p>

  <p>There was a story that she had met a handsome young trader and had eloped
  with him, that John Minute had chased them over three hundred miles of
  hostile country from Victoria Falls to Charter, from Charter to Marandalas,
  from Marandalas to Massikassi, and had arrived in Biera so close upon their
  trail that he had seen the ship which carried them to the Cape steaming down
  the river.</p>

  <p>He had never married again. Report said that the woman had died of
  malaria. A more popular version of the story was that John Minute had
  relentlessly followed his erring wife to Pieter Maritzburg and had shot her
  and had thereupon served seven years on the breakwater for his sin.</p>

  <p>About a man who is rich, powerful, and wholly unpopular, hated by the
  majority, and feared by all, legends grow as quickly as toadstools on a
  marshy moor. Some were half true, some wholly apocryphal, deliberate, and
  malicious inventions. True or false, John Minute ignored them all, denying
  nothing, explaining nothing, and even refusing to take action against a Cape
  Town weekly which dealt with his career in a spirit of unpardonable
  frankness.</p>

  <p>There was only one person in the world whom he loved more than the girl
  whose hand he held as they went down to the cheeriest restaurant in
  London.</p>

  <p>"I have had a queer interview," he said in his gruff, quick way, "I have
  been to see the police."</p>

  <p>"Oh, uncle!" she said reproachfully.</p>

  <p>He jerked his shoulder impatiently.</p>

  <p>"My dear, you don't know," he said. "I have got all sorts of people
  who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped short.</p>

  <p>"What was there remarkable in the interview? she asked, after he had
  ordered the lunch.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard," he asked, "of Saul Arthur Mann?"</p>

  <p>"Saul Arthur Mann?" she repeated, "I seem to know that name. Mann, Mann!
  Where have I heard it?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said he, with that fierce and fleeting little smile which rarely
  lit his face for a second, "if you don't know him he knows you; he knows
  everybody."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I remember! He is 'The Man Who Knows!'"</p>

  <p>It was his turn to be astonished.</p>

  <p>"Where in the world have you heard of him?"</p>

  <p>Briefly she retailed her experience, and when she came to describe the
  omniscient Mr. Mann&mdash;"A crank," growled Mr. Minute. "I was hoping there
  was something in it."</p>

  <p>"Surely, uncle, there must be something in it," said the girl seriously.
  "A man of the standing of the chief commissioner would not speak about him as
  Sir George did unless he had very excellent reason."</p>

  <p>"Tell me some more about what you saw," he said. "I seem to remember the
  report of the inquest. The dead man was unknown and has not been
  identified."</p>

  <p>She described, as well as she could remember, her meeting with the
  knowledgable Mr. Mann. She had to be tactful because she wished to tell the
  story without betraying the fact that she had been with Frank. But she might
  have saved herself the trouble, because when she was halfway through the
  narrative he interrupted her.</p>

  <p>"I gather you were not by yourself," he grumbled. "Master Frank was
  somewhere handy, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"I met him quite by accident," she said demurely.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said John Minute.</p>

  <p>"Oh, uncle, and there was a man whom Frank knew! You probably know
  him&mdash;Constable Wiseman."</p>

  <p>John Minute unfolded his napkin, stirred his soup, and grunted.</p>

  <p>"Wiseman is a stupid ass," he said briefly. "The mere fact that he was
  mixed up in the affair is sufficient explanation as to why the dead man
  remains unknown. I know Constable Wiseman very well," he said. "He has
  summoned me twice&mdash;once for doing a little pistol-shooting in the garden
  just as an object lesson to all tramps, and once&mdash;confound
  him!&mdash;for a smoking chimney. Oh, yes, I know Constable Wiseman."</p>

  <p>Apparently the thought of Constable Wiseman filled his mind through two
  courses, for he did not speak until he set his fish knife and fork together
  and muttered something about a "silly, meddling jackass!"</p>

  <p>He was very silent throughout the meal, his mind being divided between two
  subjects. Uppermost, though of least importance, was the personality of Saul
  Arthur Mann. Him he mentally viewed with suspicion and apprehension. It was
  an irritation even to suggest that there might be secret places in his own
  life which could be flooded with the light of this man's knowledge, and he
  resolved to beard "The Man Who Knows" in his den that afternoon and challenge
  him by inference to produce all the information he had concerning his
  past.</p>

  <p>There was much which was public property. It was John Minute's boast that
  his life was a book which might be read, but in his inmost heart he knew of
  one dark place which baffled the outside world. He brought himself from the
  mental rehearsal of his interview to what was, after all, the first and more
  important business.</p>

  <p>"May," he said suddenly, "have you thought any more about what I asked
  you?"</p>

  <p>She made no attempt to fence with the question.</p>

  <p>"You mean Jasper Cole?"</p>

  <p>He nodded, and for the moment she made no reply, and sat with eyes
  downcast, tracing a little figure upon the tablecloth with her finger
  tip.</p>

  <p>"The truth is, uncle," she said at last, "I am not keen on marriage at all
  just yet, and you are sufficiently acquainted with human nature to know that
  anything which savors of coercion will not make me predisposed toward Mr.
  Cole."</p>

  <p>"I suppose the real truth is," he said gruffly, "that you are in love with
  Frank?"</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"That is just what the real truth is not," she said. "I like Frank very
  much. He is a dear, bright, sunny boy."</p>

  <p>Mr. Minute grunted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, he is!" the girl went on. "But I am not in love with him
  &mdash;really."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are not influenced by the fact that he is my&mdash;heir,"
  he said, and eyed her keenly.</p>

  <p>She met his glance steadily.</p>

  <p>"If you were not the nicest man I know," she smiled, "I should be very
  offended. Of course, I don't care whether Frank is rich or poor. You have
  provided too well for me for mercenary considerations to weigh at all with
  me."</p>

  <p>John Minute grunted again.</p>

  <p>"I am quite serious about Jasper."</p>

  <p>"Why are you so keen on Jasper?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I know him," he said shortly. "He has proved to me in a hundred ways that
  he is a reliable, decent lad. He has become almost indispensable to me," he
  continued with his quick little laugh, "and that Frank has never been. Oh,
  yes, Frank's all right in his way, but he's crazy on things which cut no ice
  with me. Too fond of sports, too fond of loafing," he growled.</p>

  <p>The girl laughed again.</p>

  <p>"I can give you a little information on one point," John Minute went on,
  "and it was to tell you this that I brought you here to-day. I am a very rich
  man. You know that. I have made millions and lost them, but I have still
  enough to satisfy my heirs. I am leaving you two hundred thousand pounds in
  my will."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a startled exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Uncle!" she said.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is not a quarter of my fortune," he went on quickly, "but it will make
  you comfortable after I am gone."</p>

  <p>He rested his elbows on the table and looked at her searchingly.</p>

  <p>"You are an heiress," he said, "for, whatever you did, I should never
  change my mind. Oh, I know you will do nothing of which I should disapprove,
  but there is the fact. If you marry Frank you would still get your two
  hundred thousand, though I should bitterly regret your marriage. No, my
  girl," he said more kindly than was his wont, "I only ask you this
  &mdash;that whatever else you do, you will not make your choice until the
  next fortnight has expired."</p>

  <p>With a jerk of his head, John Minute summoned a waiter and paid his
  bill.</p>

  <p>No more was said until he handed her into her cab in the courtyard.</p>

  <p>"I shall be in town next week," he said.</p>

  <p>He watched the cab disappear in the stream of traffic which flowed along
  the Strand, and, calling another taxi, he drove to the address with which the
  chief commissioner had furnished him.</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap06"
     id="chap06">VI. THE MAN WHO KNEW</a></h2>

  <p>Backwell Street, in the City of London, contains one palatial building
  which at one time was the headquarters of the South American Stock Exchange,
  a superior bucket shop which on its failure had claimed its fifty thousand
  victims. The ornate gold lettering on its great plate- glass window had long
  since been removed, and the big brass plate which announced to the passerby
  that here sat the spider weaving his golden web for the multitude of flies,
  had been replaced by a modest, oxidized scroll bearing the simple legend:</p>

  <p class="sign">SAUL ARTHUR MANN</p>

  <p>What Mr. Mann's business was few people knew. He kept an army of clerks.
  He had the largest collection of file cabinets possessed by any three
  business houses in the City, he had an enormous post bag, and both he and his
  clerks kept regulation business hours. His beginnings, however, were well
  known.</p>

  <p>He had been a stockbroker's clerk, with a passion for collecting clippings
  mainly dealing with political, geographical, and meteorological conditions
  obtaining in those areas wherein the great Joint Stock Companies of the earth
  were engaged in operations. He had gradually built up a service of
  correspondence all over the world.</p>

  <p>The first news of labor trouble on a gold field came to him, and his
  brokers indicated his view upon the situation in that particular area by
  "bearing" the stock of the affected company.</p>

  <p>If his Liverpool agents suddenly descended upon the Cotton Exchange and
  began buying May cotton in enormous quantities, the initiated knew that Saul
  Arthur Mann had been awakened from his slumbers by a telegram describing
  storm havoc in the cotton belt of the United States of America. When a
  curious blight fell upon the coffee plantations of Ceylon, a six-
  hundred-word cablegram describing the habits and characteristics of the
  minute insect which caused the blight reached Saul Arthur Mann at two o'clock
  in the afternoon, and by three o'clock the price of coffee had jumped.</p>

  <p>When, on another occasion, Se&ntilde;or Almarez, the President of Cacura,
  had thrown a glass of wine in the face of his brother-in-law, Captain
  Vassalaro, Saul Arthur Mann had jumped into the market and beaten down all
  Cacura stocks, which were fairly high as a result of excellent crops and
  secure government. He "beared" them because he knew that Vassalaro was a dead
  shot, and that the inevitable duel would deprive Cacura of the best president
  it had had for twenty years, and that the way would be open for the election
  of Sebastian Romelez, who had behind him a certain group of German financiers
  who desired to exploit the country in their own peculiar fashion.</p>

  <p>He probably built up a very considerable fortune, and it is certain that
  he extended the range of his inquiries until the making of money by means of
  his curious information bureau became only a secondary consideration. He had
  a marvelous memory, which was supplemented by his system of filing. He would
  go to work patiently for months, and spend sums of money out of all
  proportion to the value of the information, to discover, for example, the
  reason why a district officer in some far-away spot in India had been obliged
  to return to England before his tour of duty had ended.</p>

  <p>His thirst for facts was insatiable; his grasp of the politics of every
  country in the world, and his extraordinarily accurate information concerning
  the personality of all those who directed those policies, was the basis upon
  which he was able to build up theories of amazing accuracy.</p>

  <p>A man of simple tastes, who lived in a rambling old house in Streatham,
  his work, his hobby, and his very life was his bureau. He had assisted the
  police times without number, and had been so fascinated by the success of
  this branch of his investigations that he had started a new criminal record,
  which had been of the greatest help to the police and had piqued Scotland
  Yard to emulation.</p>

  <p>John Minute, descending from his cab at the door, looked up at the
  imposing facia with a frown. Entering the broad vestibule, he handed his card
  to the waiting attendant and took a seat in a well-furnished waiting room.
  Five minutes later he was ushered into the presence of "The Man Who Knew."
  Mr. Mann, a comical little figure at a very large writing table, jumped up
  and went halfway across the big room to meet his visitor. He beamed through
  his big spectacles as he waved John Minute to a deep armchair.</p>

  <p>"The chief commissioner sent you, didn't he?" he said, pointing an
  accusing finger at the visitor. "I know he did, because he called me up this
  morning and asked me about three people who, I happen to know, have been
  bothering you. Now what can I do for you, Mr. Minute?"</p>

  <p>John Minute stretched his legs and thrust his hands defiantly into his
  trousers' pockets.</p>

  <p>"You can tell me all you know about me," he said.</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann trotted back to his big table and seated himself.</p>

  <p>"I haven't time to tell you as much," he said breezily, "but I'll give you
  a few outlines."</p>

  <p>He pressed a bell at his desk, opened a big index, and ran his finger
  down.</p>

  <p>"Bring me 8874," he said impressively to the clerk who made his
  appearance.</p>

  <p>To John Minute's surprise, it was not a bulky dossier with which the
  attendant returned, but a neat little book soberly bound in gray.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Mr. Mann, wriggling himself comfortably back in his chair, "I
  will read a few things to you."</p>

  <p>He held up the book.</p>

  <p>"There are no names in this book, my friend; not a single, blessed name.
  Nobody knows who 8874 is except myself."</p>

  <p>He patted the big index affectionately.</p>

  <p>"The name is there. When I leave this office it will be behind three
  depths of steel; when I die it will be burned with me."</p>

  <p>He opened the little book again and read. He read steadily for a quarter
  of an hour in a monotonous, singsong voice, and John Minute slowly sat
  himself erect and listened with tense face and narrow eyelids to the record.
  He did not interrupt until the other had finished.</p>

  <p>"Half of your facts are lies," he said harshly. "Some of them are just
  common gossip; some are purely imaginary."</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann closed the book and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Everything here," he said, touching the book, "is true. It may not be the
  truth as you want it known, but it is the truth. If I thought there was a
  single fact in there which was not true my <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> would
  be lost. That is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, Mr.
  Minute," he went on, and the good-natured little face was pink with
  annoyance.</p>

  <p>"Suppose it were the truth," interrupted John Minute, "what price would
  you ask for that record and such documents as you say you have to prove its
  truth?"</p>

  <p>The other leaned back in his chair and clasped his hands meditatively.</p>

  <p>"How much do you think you are worth, Mr. Minute?"</p>

  <p>"You ought to know," said the other with a sneer.</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"At the present price of securities, I should say about one million two
  hundred and seventy thousand pounds," he said, and John Minute opened his
  eyes in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Near enough," he reluctantly admitted.</p>

  <p>"Well," the little man continued, "if you multiply that by fifty and you
  bring all that money into my office and place it on that table in ten-
  thousand-pound notes, you could not buy that little book or the records which
  support it."</p>

  <p>He jumped up.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I am keeping you, Mr. Minute."</p>

  <p>"You are not keeping me," said the other roughly. "Before I go I want to
  know what use you are going to make of your knowledge."</p>

  <p>The little man spread out his hands in deprecation.</p>

  <p>"What use? You have seen the use to which I have put it. I have told you
  what no other living soul will know."</p>

  <p>"How do you know I am John Minute?" asked the visitor quickly.</p>

  <p>"Some twenty-seven photographs of you are included in the folder which
  contains your record, Mr. Minute," said the little investigator calmly. "You
  see, you are quite a prominent personage&mdash;one of the two hundred and
  four really rich men in England. I am not likely to mistake you for anybody
  else, and, more than this, your history is so interesting a one that
  naturally I know much more about you than I should if you had lived the dull
  and placid life of a city merchant."</p>

  <p>"Tell me one thing before I go," asked Minute. "Where is the person you
  refer to as 'X'?"</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann smiled and inclined his head never so slightly.</p>

  <p>"That is a question which you have no right to ask," he said. "It is
  information which is available to the police or to any authorized person who
  wishes to get into touch with 'X.' I might add," he went on, "that there is
  much more I could tell you, if it were not that it would involve persons with
  whom you are acquainted."</p>

  <p>John Minute left the bureau looking a little older, a little paler than
  when he had entered. He drove to his club with one thought in his mind, and
  that thought revolved about the identity and the whereabouts of the person
  referred to in the little man's record as "X."</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap07"
     id="chap07">VII. INTRODUCING MR. REX HOLLAND</a></h2>

  <p>Mr. Rex Holland stepped out of his new car, and, standing back a pace,
  surveyed his recent acquisition with a dispassionate eye.</p>

  <p>"I think she will do, Feltham," he said.</p>

  <p>The chauffeur touched his cap and grinned broadly.</p>

  <p>"She did it in thirty-eight minutes, sir; not bad for a twenty-mile
  run&mdash;half of it through London."</p>

  <p>"Not bad," agreed Mr. Holland, slowly stripping his gloves.</p>

  <p>The car was drawn up at the entrance to the country cottage which a lavish
  expenditure of money had converted into a bijou palace.</p>

  <p>He still lingered, and the chauffeur, feeling that some encouragement to
  conversation was called for, ventured the view that a car ought to be a good
  one if one spent eight hundred pounds on it.</p>

  <p>"Everything that is good costs money," said Mr. Rex Holland sententiously,
  and then continued: "Correct me if I am mistaken, but as we came through
  Putney did I not see you nod to the driver of another car?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"When I engaged you," Mr. Holland went on in his even voice, "you told me
  that you had just arrived from Australia and knew nobody in England; I think
  my advertisement made it clear that I wanted a man who fulfilled these
  conditions?"</p>

  <p>"Quite right, sir. I was as much surprised as you; the driver of that car
  was a fellow who traveled over to the old country on the same boat as me.
  It's rather rum that he should have got the same kind of job."</p>

  <p>Mr. Holland smiled quietly.</p>

  <p>"I hope his employer is not as eccentric as I and that he pays his servant
  on my scale."</p>

  <p>With this shot he unlocked and passed through the door of the cottage.</p>

  <p>Feltham drove his car to the garage which had been built at the back of
  the house, and, once free from observation, lit his pipe, and, seating
  himself on a box, drew from his pocket a little card which he perused with
  unusual care.</p>

  <p>He read:</p>

  <p>One: To act as chauffeur and valet. Two: To receive ten pounds a week and
  expenses. Three: To make no friends or acquaintances. Four: Never under any
  circumstances to discuss my employer, his habits, or his business. Five:
  Never under any circumstances to go farther eastward into London than is
  represented by a line drawn from the Marble Arch to Victoria Station. Six:
  Never to recognize my employer if I see him in the street in company with any
  other person.</p>

  <p>The chauffeur folded the card and scratched his chin reflectively.</p>

  <p>"Eccentricity," he said.</p>

  <p>It was a nice five-syllable word, and its employment was a comfort to this
  perturbed Australian. He cleaned his face and hands, and went into the tiny
  kitchen to prepare his master's dinner.</p>

  <p>Mr. Holland's house was a remarkable one. It was filled with every form of
  labor-saving device which the ingenuity of man could devise. The furniture,
  if luxurious, was not in any great quantity. Vacuum tubes were to be found in
  every room, and by the attachment of hose and nozzle and the pressure of a
  switch each room could be dusted in a few minutes. From the kitchen, at the
  back of the cottage, to the dining room ran two endless belts electrically
  controlled, which presently carried to the table the very simple meal which
  his cook-chauffeur had prepared.</p>

  <p>The remnants of dinner were cleared away, the chauffeur dismissed to his
  quarters, a little one-roomed building separated from the cottage, and the
  switch was turned over which heated the automatic coffee percolator which
  stood on the sideboard.</p>

  <p>Mr. Holland sat reading, his feet resting on a chair.</p>

  <p>He only interrupted his study long enough to draw off the coffee into a
  little white cup and to switch off the current.</p>

  <p>He sat until the little silver clock on the mantelshelf struck twelve, and
  then he placed a card in the book to mark the place, closed it, and rose
  leisurely.</p>

  <p>He slid back a panel in the wall, disclosing the steel door of a safe.
  This he opened with a key which he selected from a bunch. From the interior
  of the safe he removed a cedarwood box, also locked. He threw back the lid
  and removed one by one three check books and a pair of gloves of some thin,
  transparent fabric. These were obviously to guard against tell-tale finger
  prints.</p>

  <p>He carefully pulled them on and buttoned them. Next he detached three
  checks, one from each book, and, taking a fountain pen from his pocket, he
  began filling in the blank spaces. He wrote slowly, almost laboriously, and
  he wrote without a copy. There are very few forgers in the criminal records
  who have ever accomplished the feat of imitating a man's signature from
  memory. Mr. Rex Holland was singularly exceptional to all precedent, for from
  the date to the flourishing signature these checks might have been written
  and signed by John Minute.</p>

  <p>There were the same fantastic "E's," the same stiff-tailed "Y's." Even
  John Minute might have been in doubt whether he wrote the "Eight hundred and
  fifty" which appeared on one slip.</p>

  <p>Mr. Holland surveyed his handiwork without emotion.</p>

  <p>He waited for the ink to dry before he folded the checks and put them in
  his pocket. This was John Minute's way, for the millionaire never used
  blotting paper for some reason, probably not unconnected with an event in his
  earlier career. When the checks were in his pocket, Mr. Holland removed his
  gloves, replaced them with the check books in the box and in the safe, locked
  the steel door, drew the sliding panel, and went to bed.</p>

  <p>Early the next morning he summoned his servant.</p>

  <p>"Take the car back to town," he said. "I am going back by train. Meet me
  at the Holland Park tube at two o'clock; I have a little job for you which
  will earn you five hundred."</p>

  <p>"That's my job, sir," said the dazed man when he recovered from the
  shock.</p>

  <p>Frank sometimes accompanied May to the East End, and on the day Mr. Rex
  Holland returned to London he called for the girl at her flat to drive her to
  Canning Town.</p>

  <p>"You can come in and have some tea," she invited.</p>

  <p>"You're a luxurious beggar, May," he said, glancing round approvingly at
  the prettily furnished sitting room. "Contrast this with my humble abode in
  Bayswater."</p>

  <p>"I don't know your humble abode in Bayswater," she laughed. "But why on
  earth you should elect to live at Bayswater I can't imagine."</p>

  <p>He sipped his tea with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

  <p>"Guess what income the heir of the Minute millions enjoys?" he asked
  ironically. "No, I'll save you the agony of guessing. I earn seven pounds a
  week at the bank, and that is the whole of my income."</p>

  <p>"But doesn't uncle&mdash;" she began in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Not a bob," replied Frank vulgarly; "not half a bob."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know what you're going to say; he treats you generously, I know. He
  treats me justly. Between generosity and justice, give me generosity all the
  time. I will tell you something else. He pays Jasper Cole a thousand a year!
  It's very curious, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>She leaned over and patted his arm.</p>

  <p>"Poor boy," she said sympathetically, "that doesn't make it any
  easier&mdash;Jasper, I mean."</p>

  <p>Frank indulged in a little grimace, and said:</p>

  <p>"By the way, I saw the mysterious Jasper this morning&mdash;coming out of
  the Waterloo Station looking more mysterious than ever. What particular
  business has he in the country?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head and rose.</p>

  <p>"I know as little about Jasper as you," she answered.</p>

  <p>She turned and looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Frank," she said, "I am rather worried about you and Jasper. I am worried
  because your uncle does not seem to take the same view of Jasper as you take.
  It is not a very heroic position for either of you, and it is rather hateful
  for me."</p>

  <p>Frank looked at her with a quizzical smile.</p>

  <p>"Why hateful for you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I would like to tell you everything, but that would not be fair."</p>

  <p>"To whom?" Frank asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"To you, your uncle, or to Jasper."</p>

  <p>He came nearer to her.</p>

  <p>"Have you so warm a feeling for Jasper?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have no warm feeling for anybody," she said candidly. "Oh, don't look
  so glum, Frank! I suppose I am slow to develop, but you cannot expect me to
  have any very decided views yet a while."</p>

  <p>Frank smiled ruefully.</p>

  <p>"That is my one big trouble, dear," he said quietly; "bigger than anything
  else in the world."</p>

  <p>She stood with her hand on the door, hesitating, a look of perplexity upon
  her beautiful face. She was of the tall, slender type, a girl slowly ripening
  into womanhood. She might have been described as cold and a little
  repressive, but the truth was that she was as yet untouched by the fires of
  passion, and for all her twenty-one years she was still something of the
  healthy schoolgirl, with a schoolgirl's impatience of sentiment.</p>

  <p>"I am the last to spin a hard-luck yarn," Frank went on, "but I have not
  had the best of everything, dear. I started wrong with uncle. He never liked
  my father nor any of my father's family. His treatment of his wife was
  infamous. My poor governor was one of those easy-going fellows who was always
  in trouble, and it was always John Minute's job to get him out. I don't like
  talking about him&mdash;" He hesitated.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I know," she said sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"Father was not the rotter that Uncle John thinks he was. He had his good
  points. He was careless, and he drank much more than was good for him, but
  all the scrapes he fell into were due to this latter failing."</p>

  <p>The girl knew the story of Doctor Merrill. It had been sketched briefly
  but vividly by John Minute. She knew also some of those scrapes which had
  involved Doctor Merrill's ruin, material and moral.</p>

  <p>"Frank," she said, "if I can help you in any way I would do it."</p>

  <p>"You can help me absolutely," said the young man quietly, "by marrying
  me."</p>

  <p>She gasped.</p>

  <p>"When?" she asked, startled.</p>

  <p>"Now, next week; at any rate, soon." He smiled, and, crossing to her,
  caught her hand in his.</p>

  <p>"May, dear, you know I love you. You know there is nothing in the world I
  would not do for you, no sacrifice that I would not make."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You must give me some time to think about this, Frank," she said.</p>

  <p>"Don't go," he begged. "You cannot know how urgent is my need of you.
  Uncle John has told you a great deal about me, but has he told you
  this&mdash;that my only hope of independence&mdash;independence of his
  millions and his influence&mdash;you cannot know how widespread or pernicious
  that influence is," he said, with an unaccustomed passion in his voice, "lies
  in my marriage before my twenty-fourth birthday?"</p>

  <p>"Frank!"</p>

  <p>"It is true. I cannot tell you any more, but John Minute knows. If I am
  married within the next ten days"&mdash;he snapped his fingers &mdash;"that
  for his millions. I am independent of his legacies, independent of his
  patronage."</p>

  <p>She stared at him, open-eyed.</p>

  <p>"You never told me this before."</p>

  <p>He shook his head a little despairingly.</p>

  <p>"There are some things I can never tell you, May, and some things which
  you can never know till we are married. I only ask you to trust me."</p>

  <p>"But suppose," she faltered, "you are not married within ten days, what
  will happen?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"'I am John's liege man of life and limb and of earthly regard,'" he
  quoted flippantly. "I shall wait hopefully for the only release that can
  come, the release which his death will bring. I hate saying that, for there
  is something about him that I like enormously, but that is the truth, and,
  May," he said, still holding her hand and looking earnestly into her face, "I
  don't want to feel like that about John Minute. I don't want to look forward
  to his end. I want to meet him without any sense of dependence. I don't want
  to be looking all the time for signs of decay and decrepitude, and hail each
  illness he may have with a feeling of pleasant anticipation. It is beastly of
  me to talk like this, I know, but if you were in my position&mdash;if you
  knew all that I know&mdash;you would understand."</p>

  <p>The girl's mind was in a ferment. An ordinary meeting had developed so
  tumultuously that she had lost her command of the situation. A hundred
  thoughts ran riot through her mind. She felt as though she were an arbitrator
  deciding between two men, of both of whom she was fond, and, even at that
  moment, there intruded into her mental vision a picture of Jasper Cole, with
  his pale, intellectual face and his grave, dark eyes.</p>

  <p>"I must think about this," she said again. "I don't think you had better
  come down to the mission with me."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," he said.</p>

  <p>Gently she released her hand and left him.</p>

  <p>For her that day was one of supreme mental perturbation. What was the
  extraordinary reason which compelled his marriage by his twenty-fourth
  birthday? She remembered how John Minute had insisted that her thoughts about
  marriage should be at least postponed for the next fortnight. Why had John
  Minute suddenly sprung this story of her legacy upon her? For the first time
  in her life she began to regard her uncle with suspicion.</p>

  <p>For Frank the day did not develop without its sensations. The Piccadilly
  branch of the London and Western Counties Bank occupies commodious premises,
  but Frank had never been granted the use of a private office. His big desk
  was in a corner remote from the counter, surrounded on three sides by a
  screen which was half glass and half teak paneling. From where he sat he
  could secure a view of the counter, a necessary provision, since he was
  occasionally called upon to identify the bearers of checks.</p>

  <p>He returned a little before three o'clock in the afternoon, and Mr.
  Brandon, the manager, came hurriedly from his little sanctum at the rear of
  the premises and beckoned Frank into his office.</p>

  <p>"You've taken an awful long time for lunch," he complained.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said Frank. "I met Miss Nuttall, and the time flew."</p>

  <p>"Did you see Holland the other day?" the manager interrupted.</p>

  <p>"I didn't see him on the day you sent me," replied Frank, "but I saw him
  on the following day."</p>

  <p>"Is he a friend of your uncle's?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>The manager took up three checks which lay on the table, and Frank
  examined them. One was for eight hundred and fifty pounds six shillings, and
  was drawn upon the Liverpool Cotton Bank, one was for forty-one thousand one
  hundred and forty pounds, and was drawn upon the Bank of England, and the
  other was for seven thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine pounds fourteen
  shillings. They were all signed "John Minute," and they were all made payable
  to "Rex Holland, esquire," and were crossed.</p>

  <p>Now John Minute had a very curious practice of splitting up payments so
  that they covered the three banking houses at which his money was deposited.
  The check for seven thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine pounds fourteen
  shillings was drawn upon the London and Western Counties Bank, and that would
  have afforded the manager some clew even if he had not been well acquainted
  with John Minute's eccentricity.</p>

  <p>"Seven thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine pounds fourteen shillings
  from Mr. Minute's balance," said the manager, "leaves exactly fifty thousand
  pounds."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brandon shook his head in despair at the unbusinesslike methods of his
  patron.</p>

  <p>"Does he know your uncle?"</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"Rex Holland."</p>

  <p>Frank frowned in an effort of memory.</p>

  <p>"I don't remember my uncle ever speaking of him, and yet, now I come to
  think of it, one of the first checks he put into the bank was on my uncle's
  account. Yes, now I remember," he exclaimed. "He opened the account on a
  letter of introduction which was signed by Mr. Minute. I thought at the time
  that they had probably had business dealings together, and as uncle never
  encourages the discussion of bank affairs outside of the bank, I have never
  mentioned it to him."</p>

  <p>Again Mr. Brandon shook his head in doubt.</p>

  <p>"I must say, Mr. Merrill," he said, "I don't like these mysterious
  depositors. What is he like in appearance?"</p>

  <p>"Rather a tall, youngish man, exquisitely dressed."</p>

  <p>"Clean shaven?"</p>

  <p>"No, he has a closely trimmed black beard, though he cannot be much more
  than twenty-eight. In fact, when I saw him for the first time the face was
  familiar to me and I had an impression of having seen him before. I think he
  was wearing a gold-rimmed eyeglass when he came on the first occasion, but I
  have never met him in the street, and he hardly moves in my humble social
  circle." Frank smiled.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is all right," said the manager dubiously; "but, anyway,
  I'll see him to-morrow. As a precautionary measure we might get in touch with
  your uncle, though I know he'll raise Cain if we bother him about his
  account."</p>

  <p>"He will certainly raise Cain if you get in touch with him to-day," smiled
  Frank, "for he is due to leave by the two-twenty this afternoon for
  Paris."</p>

  <p>It wanted five minutes to the hour at which the bank closed when a clerk
  came through the swing door and laid a letter upon the counter which was
  taken in to Mr. Brandon, who came into the office immediately and crossed to
  where Frank sat.</p>

  <p>"Look at this," he said.</p>

  <p>Frank took the letter and read it. It was addressed to the manager, and
  ran:</p>

  <p>DEAR SIR: I am leaving for Paris to-night to join my partner, Mr. Minute.
  I shall be very glad, therefore, if you will arrange to cash the inclosed
  check. Yours faithfully, REX A. HOLLAND.</p>

  <p>The "inclosed check" was for fifty-five thousand pounds and was within
  five thousand pounds of the amount standing to Mr. Holland's account in the
  bank. There was a postscript to the letter:</p>

  <p>You will accept this, my receipt, for the sum, and hand it to my
  messenger, Sergeant George Graylin, of the corps of commissionaires, and this
  form of receipt will serve to indemnify you against loss in the event of
  mishap.</p>

  <p>The manager walked to the counter.</p>

  <p>"Who gave you this letter?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Holland, sir," said the man.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mr. Holland?" asked Frank.</p>

  <p>The sergeant shook his head.</p>

  <p>"At his flat. My instructions were to take this letter to the bank and
  bring back the money."</p>

  <p>The manager was in a quandary. It was a regular transaction, and it was by
  no means unusual to pay out money in this way. It was only the largeness of
  the sum which made him hesitate. He disappeared into his office and came back
  with two bundles of notes which he had taken from the safe. He counted them
  over, placed them in a sealed envelope, and received from the sergeant his
  receipt.</p>

  <p>When the man had gone Brandon wiped his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" he said. "I don't like this way of doing business very much, and I
  should be very glad indeed to be transferred back to the head office."</p>

  <p>The words were hardly out of his mouth when a bell rang violently. The
  front doors of the bank had been closed with the departure of the
  commissioner, and one of the junior clerks, balancing up his day book,
  dropped his pen, and, at a sign from his chief, walking to the door, pulled
  back the bolts and admitted&mdash;John Minute.</p>

  <p>Frank stared at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Hello, uncle," he said. "I wish you had come a few minutes before. I
  thought you were in Paris."</p>

  <p>"The wire calling me to Paris was a fake," growled John Minute. "I wired
  for confirmation, and discovered my Paris people had not sent me any message.
  I only got the wire just before the train started. I have been spending all
  the afternoon getting on to the phone to Paris to untangle the muddle. Why
  did you wish I was here five minutes before?"</p>

  <p>"Because," said Frank, "we have just paid out fifty-five thousand pounds
  to your friend, Mr. Holland."</p>

  <p>"My friend?" John Minute stared from the manager to Frank and from Frank
  to the manager, who suddenly experienced a sinking feeling which accompanies
  disaster.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by 'my friend'?" asked John Minute. "I have never heard
  of the man before."</p>

  <p>"Didn't you give Mr. Holland checks amounting to fifty-five thousand
  pounds this morning?" gasped the manager, turning suddenly pale.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not!" roared John Minute. "Why the devil should I give him
  checks? I have never heard of the man."</p>

  <p>The manager grasped the counter for support.</p>

  <p>He explained the situation in a few halting words, and led the way to his
  office, Frank accompanying him.</p>

  <p>John Minute examined the checks.</p>

  <p>"That is my writing," he said. "I could swear to it myself, and yet I
  never wrote those checks or signed them. Did you note the commissionaire's
  number?"</p>

  <p>"As it happens I jotted it down," said Frank.</p>

  <p>By this time the manager was on the phone to the police. At seven o'clock
  that night the commissionaire was discovered. He had been employed, he said,
  by a Mr. Holland, whom he described as a slimmish man, clean shaven, and by
  no means answering to the description which Frank had given.</p>

  <p>"I have lived for a long time in Australia," said the commissionaire, "and
  he spoke like an Australian. In fact, when I mentioned certain places I had
  been to he told me he knew them."</p>

  <p>The police further discovered that the Knightsbridge flat had been taken,
  furnished, three months before by Mr. Rex Holland, the negotiations having
  been by letter. Mr. Holland's agent had assumed responsibility for the flat,
  and Mr. Holland's agent was easily discoverable in a clerk in the employment
  of a well-known firm of surveyors and auctioneers, who had also received his
  commission by letter.</p>

  <p>When the police searched the flat they found only one thing which helped
  them in their investigations. The hall porter said that, as often as not, the
  flat was untenanted, and only occasionally, when he was off duty, had Mr.
  Holland put in an appearance, and he only knew this from statements which had
  been made by other tenants.</p>

  <p>"It comes to this," said John Minute grimly; "that nobody has seen Mr.
  Holland but you, Frank."</p>

  <p>Frank stiffened.</p>

  <p>"I am not suggesting that you are in the swindle," said Minute gruffly.
  "As likely as not, the man you saw was not Mr. Holland, and it is probably
  the work of a gang, but I am going to find out who this man is, if I have to
  spend twice as much as I have lost."</p>

  <p>The police were not encouraging.</p>

  <p>Detective Inspector Nash, from Scotland Yard, who had handled some of the
  biggest cases of bank swindles, held out no hope of the money being
  recovered.</p>

  <p>"In theory you can get back the notes if you have their numbers," he said,
  "but in practice it is almost impossible to recover them, because it is quite
  easy to change even notes for five hundred pounds, and probably you will find
  these in circulation in a week or two."</p>

  <p>His speculation proved to be correct, for on the third day after the crime
  three of the missing notes made a curious appearance.</p>

  <p>"Ready-Money Minute," true to his nickname, was in the habit of balancing
  his accounts as between bank and bank by cash payments. He had made it a
  practice for all his dividends to be paid in actual cash, and these were sent
  to the Piccadilly branch of the London and Western Counties Bank in bulk.
  After a payment of a very large sum on account of certain dividends accruing
  from his South African investments, three of the missing notes were
  discovered in the bank itself.</p>

  <p>John Minute, apprised by telegram of the fact, said nothing; for the money
  had been paid in by his confidential secretary, Jasper Cole, and there was
  excellent reason why he did not desire to emphasize the fact.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap08"
     id="chap08">VIII. SERGEANT SMITH CALLS</a></h2>

  <p>The big library of Weald Lodge was brilliantly lighted and nobody had
  pulled down the blinds. So that it was possible for any man who troubled to
  jump the low stone wall which ran by the road and push a way through the damp
  shrubbery to see all that was happening in the room.</p>

  <p>Weald Lodge stands between Eastbourne and Wilmington, and in the winter
  months the curious, represented by youthful holiday makers, are few and far
  between. Constable Wiseman, of the Eastbourne constabulary, certainly was not
  curious. He paced his slow, moist way and merely noted, in passing, the fact
  that the flood of light reflected on the little patch of lawn at the side of
  the house.</p>

  <p>The hour was nine o'clock on a June evening, and officially it was only
  the hour of sunset, though lowering rain clouds had so darkened the world
  that night had closed down upon the weald, had blotted out its pleasant
  villages and had hidden the green downs.</p>

  <p>He continued to the end of his beat and met his impatient superior.</p>

  <p>"Everything's all right, sergeant," he reported; "only old Minute's lights
  are blazing away and his windows are open."</p>

  <p>"Better go and warn him," said the sergeant, pulling his bicycle into
  position for mounting.</p>

  <p>He had his foot on the treadle, but hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I'd warn him myself, but I don't think he'd be glad to see me."</p>

  <p>He grinned to himself, then remarked: "Something queer about Minute
  &mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>"There is, indeed," agreed Constable Wiseman heartily. His beat was a
  lonely one, and he was a very bored man. If by agreement with his officer he
  could induce that loquacious gentleman to talk for a quarter of an hour, so
  much dull time might be passed. The fact that Sergeant Smith was loquacious
  indicated, too, that he had been drinking and was ready to quarrel with
  anybody.</p>

  <p>"Come under the shelter of that wall," said the sergeant, and pushed his
  machine to the protection afforded by the side wall of a house.</p>

  <p>It is possible that the sergeant was anxious to impress upon his
  subordinate's mind a point of view which might be useful to himself one
  day.</p>

  <p>"Minute is a dangerous old man," he said.</p>

  <p>"Don't I know it?" said Constable Wiseman, with the recollection of sundry
  "reportings" and inquiries.</p>

  <p>"You've got to remember that, Wiseman," the sergeant went on; "and by
  'dangerous' I mean that he's the sort of old fellow that would ask a
  constable to come in to have a drink and then report him."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" said the shocked Mr. Wiseman at this revelation of the
  blackest treachery.</p>

  <p>Sergeant Smith nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's the sort of man he is," he said. "I knew him years ago &mdash;at
  least, I've seen him. I was in Matabeleland with him, and I tell you there's
  nothing too mean for 'Ready-Money Minute'&mdash;curse him!"</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you have had a terrible life, sergeant," encouraged Constable
  Wiseman.</p>

  <p>The other laughed bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I have," he said.</p>

  <p>Sergeant Smith's acquaintance with Eastbourne was a short one. He had only
  been four years in the town, and had, so rumor ran, owed his promotion to
  influence. What that influence was none could say. It had been suggested that
  John Minute himself had secured him his sergeant's stripes, but that was a
  theory which was pooh-poohed by people who knew that the sergeant had little
  that was good to say of his supposed patron.</p>

  <p>Constable Wiseman, a profound thinker and a secret reader of sensational
  detective stories, had at one time made a report against John Minute for some
  technical offense, and had made it in fear and trembling, expecting his
  sergeant promptly to squash this attempt to persecute his patron; but, to his
  surprise and delight, Sergeant Smith had furthered his efforts and had helped
  to secure the conviction which involved a fine.</p>

  <p>"You go on and finish your beat, Constable," said the sergeant suddenly,
  "and I'll ride up to the old devil's house and see what's doing."</p>

  <p>He mounted his bicycle and trundled up the hill, dismounting before Weald
  Lodge, and propped his bicycle against the wall. He looked for a long time
  toward the open French windows, and then, jumping the wall, made his way
  slowly across the lawn, avoiding the gravel path which would betray his
  presence. He got to a point opposite the window which commanded a full view
  of the room.</p>

  <p>Though the window was open, there was a fire in the grate. To the
  sergeant's satisfaction, John Minute was alone. He sat in a deep armchair in
  his favorite attitude, his hands pushed into his pockets, his head upon his
  chest. He heard the sergeant's foot upon the gravel and stood up as the
  rain-drenched figure appeared at the open window.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is you, is it?" growled John Minute. "What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Alone?" said the sergeant, and he spoke as one to his equal.</p>

  <p>"Come in!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Minute's library had been furnished by the Artistic Furniture Company,
  of Eastbourne, which had branches at Hastings, Bexhill, Brighton,
  and&mdash;it was claimed&mdash;at London. The furniture was of dark oak,
  busily carved. There was a large bookcase which half covered one wall. This
  was the "library," and it was filled with books of uniform binding which
  occupied the shelves. The books had been supplied by a great bookseller of
  London, and included&mdash;at Mr. Minute's suggestion &mdash;"The Hundred
  Best Books," "Books That Have Helped Me," "The Encyclopedia Brillonica," and
  twenty bound volumes of a certain weekly periodical of international
  reputation. John Minute had no literary leanings.</p>

  <p>The sergeant hesitated, wiped his heavy boots on the sodden mat outside
  the window, and walked into the room.</p>

  <p>"You are pretty cozy, John," he said.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" asked Minute, without enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd look you up. My constable reported your windows were open,
  and I felt it my duty to come along and warn you&mdash;there are thieves
  about, John."</p>

  <p>"I know of one," said John Minute, looking at the other steadily. "Your
  constable, as you call him, is, I presume, that thick-headed jackass,
  Wiseman!"</p>

  <p>"Got him first time," said the sergeant, removing his waterproof cape. "I
  don't often trouble you, but somehow I had a feeling I'd like to see you
  to-night. My constable revived old memories, John."</p>

  <p>"Unpleasant for you, I hope," said John Minute ungraciously.</p>

  <p>"There's a nice little gold farm four hundred miles north of Gwelo," said
  Sergeant Smith meditatively.</p>

  <p>"And a nice little breakwater half a mile south of Cape Town," said John
  Minute, "where the Cape government keeps highwaymen who hold up the Salisbury
  coach and rob the mails."</p>

  <p>Sergeant Smith smiled.</p>

  <p>"You will have your little joke," he said; "but I might remind you that
  they have plenty of accommodation on the breakwater, John. They even take
  care of men who have stolen land and murdered natives."</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" asked John Minute again.</p>

  <p>The other grinned.</p>

  <p>"Just a pleasant little friendly visit," he explained. "I haven't looked
  you up for twelve months. It is a hard life, this police work, even when you
  have got two or three pounds a week from a private source to add to your pay.
  It is nothing like the work we have in the Matabele mounted police, eh, John?
  But, Lord," he said, looking into the fire thoughtfully, "when I think how I
  stood up in the attorney's office at Salisbury and took my solemn oath that
  old John Gedding had transferred his Saibach gold claims to you on his death
  bed; when I think of the amount of perjury &mdash;me a uniformed servant of
  the British South African Company, and, so to speak, an official of the
  law&mdash;I blush for myself."</p>

  <p>"Do you ever blush for yourself when you think of how you and your pals
  held up Hoffman's store, shot Hoffman, and took his swag?" asked John Minute.
  "I'd give a lot of money to see you blush, Crawley; and now, for about the
  fourteenth time, what do you want? If it is money, you can't have it. If it
  is more promotion, you are not fit to have it. If it is a word of
  advice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The other stopped him with a motion of his hand.</p>

  <p>"I can't afford to have your advice, John," he said. "All I know is that
  you promised me my fair share over those Saibach claims. It is a paying mine
  now. They tell me that its capital is two millions."</p>

  <p>"You were well paid," said John Minute shortly.</p>

  <p>"Five hundred pounds isn't much for the surrender of your soul's
  salvation," said Sergeant Smith.</p>

  <p>He slowly replaced his cape on his broad shoulders and walked to the
  window.</p>

  <p>"Listen here, John Minute!" All the good nature had gone out of his voice,
  and it was Trooper Henry Crawley, the lawbreaker, who spoke. "You are not
  going to satisfy me much longer with a few pounds a week. You have got to do
  the right thing by me, or I am going to blow."</p>

  <p>"Let me know when your blowing starts," said John Minute, "and I'll send
  you a bowl of soup to cool."</p>

  <p>"You're funny, but you don't amuse me," were the last words of the
  sergeant as he walked into the rain.</p>

  <p>As before, he avoided the drive and jumped over the low wall on to the
  road, and was glad that he had done so, for a motor car swung into the drive
  and pulled up before the dark doorway of the house. He was over the wall
  again in an instant, and crossing with swift, noiseless steps in the
  direction of the car. He got as close as he could and listened.</p>

  <p>Two of the voices he recognized. The third, that of a man, was a stranger.
  He heard this third person called "inspector," and wondered who was the
  guest. His curiosity was not to be satisfied, for by the time he had reached
  the view place on the lawn which overlooked the library John Minute had
  closed the windows and pulled down the blinds.</p>

  <p>The visitors to Weald Lodge were three&mdash;Jasper Cole, May Nuttall, and
  a stout, middle-aged man of slow speech but of authoritative tone. This was
  Inspector Nash, of Scotland Yard, who was in charge of the investigations
  into the forgeries. Minute received them in the library. He knew the
  inspector of old.</p>

  <p>Jasper had brought May down in response to the telegraphed instructions
  which John Minute had sent him.</p>

  <p>"What's the news?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, I think I have found your Mr. Holland," said the inspector.</p>

  <p>He took a fat case from his inside pocket, opened it, and extracted a
  snapshot photograph. It represented a big motor car, and, standing by its
  bonnet, a little man in chauffeur's uniform.</p>

  <p>"This is the fellow who called himself 'Rex Holland' and who sent the
  commissionaire on his errand. The photograph came into my possession as the
  result of an accident. It was discovered in the flat and had evidently fallen
  out of the man's pocket. I made inquiries and found that it was taken by a
  small photographer in Putney, and that the man had called for the photographs
  about ten o'clock in the morning of the same day that he sent the
  commissionaire on his errand. He was probably examining them during the
  period of his waiting in the flat, and one of them slipped to the ground. At
  any rate, the commissionaire has no doubt that this was the man."</p>

  <p>"Do you seriously suggest that this fellow is Rex Holland?"</p>

  <p>The inspector shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I think he is merely one of the gang," he said. "I don't believe you will
  ever find Rex Holland, for each of the gang took the name in turn to take the
  part, according to the circumstances in which they found themselves. I have
  been unable to identify him, except that he went by the name of Feltham and
  was an Australian. That was the name he gave to the photographer with whom he
  talked. You see, the photograph was taken in High Street, Putney. The only
  clew we have is that he has been seen several times on the Portsmouth Road,
  driving one or two cars in which was a man who is probably the nearest
  approach to Rex Holland we shall get.</p>

  <p>"I put my men on to make further investigations, and the Haslemere police
  told them that it is believed that the car was the property of a gentleman
  who lived in a lockup cottage some distance from Haslemere &mdash;evidently
  rather a swagger affair, because its owner had an electric cable and
  telephone wires laid in, and the cottage was altered and renovated twelve
  months ago at a very considerable cost. I shall be able to tell you more
  about that to-morrow."</p>

  <p>They spent the rest of the evening discussing the crime, and the girl was
  a silent listener. It was not until very late that John Minute was able to
  give her his undivided attention.</p>

  <p>"I asked you to come down," he said, "because I am getting a little
  worried about you."</p>

  <p>"Worried about me, uncle?" she said, in surprise.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>The two men had gone off to Jasper's study, and she was alone with her
  uncle.</p>

  <p>"When I lunched with you the other day at the Savoy," he said, "I spoke to
  you about your marriage, and I asked you to defer any action for a
  fortnight."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was coming down to see you on that very matter," she said. "Uncle,
  won't you tell me why you want me to delay my marriage for a fortnight, and
  why you think I am going to get married at all?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer immediately, but paced up and down the room.</p>

  <p>"May," he said, "you have heard a great deal about me which is not very
  flattering. I lived a very rough life in South Africa, and I only had one
  friend in the world in whom I had the slightest confidence. That friend was
  your father. He stood by me in my bad times. He never worried me when I was
  flush of money, never denied me when I was broke. Whenever he helped me, he
  was content with what reward I offered him. There was no 'fifty-fifty' with
  Bill Nuttall. He was a man who had no ambition, no avarice&mdash;the whitest
  man I have ever met. What I have not told you about him is this: He and I
  were equal partners in a mine, the Gwelo Deep. He had great faith in the
  mine, and I had none at all. I knew it to be one of those properties you
  sometimes get in Rhodesia, all pocket and outcrop. Anyway, we floated a
  company."</p>

  <p>He stopped and chuckled as at an amusing memory.</p>

  <p>"The pound shares were worth a little less than sixpence until a fortnight
  ago."</p>

  <p>He looked at her with one of those swift, penetrating glances, as though
  he were anxious to discover her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"A fortnight ago," he said, "I learned from my agent in Bulawayo that a
  reef had been struck on an adjoining mine, and that the reef runs through our
  property. If that is true, you will be a rich woman in your own right, apart
  from the money you get from me. I cannot tell whether it is true until I have
  heard from the engineers, who are now examining the property, and I cannot
  know that for a fortnight. May, you are a dear girl," he said, and laid his
  hand on her arm, "and I have looked after you as though you were my own
  daughter. It is a happiness to me to know that you will be a very rich woman,
  because your father's shares was the only property you inherited from him.
  There is, however, one curious thing about it that I cannot understand."</p>

  <p>He walked over to the bureau, unlocked a drawer, and took out a
  letter.</p>

  <p>"My agent says that he advised me two years ago that this reef existed,
  and wondered why I had never given him authority to bore. I have no
  recollection of his ever having told me anything of the sort. Now you know
  the position," he said, putting back the letter and closing the drawer with a
  bang.</p>

  <p>"You want me to wait for a better match," said the girl.</p>

  <p>He inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't want you to get married for a fortnight," he repeated.</p>

  <p>May Nuttall went to bed that night full of doubt and more than a little
  unhappy. The story that John Minute told about her father&mdash;was it true?
  Was it a story invented on the spur of the moment to counter Frank's plan?
  She thought of Frank and his almost solemn entreaty. There had been no
  mistaking his earnestness or his sincerity. If he would only take her into
  his confidence&mdash;and yet she recognized and was surprised at the
  revelation that she did not want that confidence. She wanted to help Frank
  very badly, and it was not the romance of the situation which appealed to
  her. There was a large sense of duty, something of that mother sense which
  every woman possesses, which tempted her to the sacrifice. Yet was it a
  sacrifice?</p>

  <p>She debated that question half the night, tossing from side to side. She
  could not sleep, and, rising before the dawn, slipped into her dressing gown
  and went to the window. The rain had ceased, the clouds had broken and stood
  in black bars against the silver light of dawn. She felt unaccountably
  hungry, and after a second's hesitation she opened the door and went down the
  broad stairs to the hall.</p>

  <p>To reach the kitchen she had to pass her uncle's door, and she noticed
  that it was ajar. She thought possibly he had gone to bed and left the light
  on, and her hand was on the knob to investigate when she heard a voice and
  drew back hurriedly. It was the voice of Jasper Cole.</p>

  <p>"I have been into the books very carefully with Mackensen, the accountant,
  and there seems no doubt," he said.</p>

  <p>"You think&mdash;" demanded her uncle.</p>

  <p>"I am certain," answered Jasper, in his even, passionless tone. "The fraud
  has been worked by Frank. He had access to the books. He was the only person
  who saw Rex Holland; he was the only official at the bank who could possibly
  falsify the entries and at the same time hide his trail."</p>

  <p>The girl turned cold and for a moment swayed as though she would faint.
  She clutched the jamb of the door for support and waited.</p>

  <p>"I am half inclined to your belief," said John Minute slowly. "It is awful
  to believe that Frank is a forger, as his father was&mdash;awful!"</p>

  <p>"It is pretty ghastly," said Jasper's voice, "but it is true."</p>

  <p>The girl flung open the door and stood in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"It is a lie!" she cried wrathfully. "A horrible lie&mdash;and you know it
  is a lie, Jasper!"</p>

  <p>Without another word, she turned, slamming the door behind her.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap09"
     id="chap09">IX. FRANK MERRILL AT THE ALTAR</a></h2>

  <p>Frank Merrill stepped through the swing doors of the London and Western
  Counties Bank with a light heart and a smile in his eyes, and went straight
  to his chief's office.</p>

  <p>"I shall want you to let me go out this afternoon for an hour," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Brandon looked up wearily. He had not been without his sleepless moments,
  and the strain of the forgery and the audit which followed was telling
  heavily upon him. He nodded a silent agreement, and Frank went back to his
  desk, humming a tune.</p>

  <p>He had every reason to be happy, for in his pocket was the special license
  which, for a consideration, had been granted to him, and which empowered him
  to marry the girl whose amazing telegram had arrived that morning while he
  was at breakfast. It had contained only four words:</p>

  <p>Marry you to-day. MAY.</p>

  <p>He could not guess what extraordinary circumstances had induced her to
  take so definite a view, but he was a very contented and happy young man.</p>

  <p>She was to arrive in London soon after twelve, and he had arranged to meet
  her at the station and take her to lunch. Perhaps then she would explain the
  reason for her action. He numbered among his acquaintances the rector of a
  suburban church, who had agreed to perform the ceremony and to provide the
  necessary witnesses.</p>

  <p>It was a beaming young man that met the girl, but the smile left his face
  when he saw how wan and haggard she was.</p>

  <p>"Take me somewhere," she said quickly.</p>

  <p>"Are you ill?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>They had the Pall Mall Restaurant to themselves, for it was too early for
  the regular lunchers.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me, dear," he said, catching her hands over the table, "to what
  do I owe this wonderful decision?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you, Frank," she said breathlessly. "I don't want to think
  about it. All I know is that people have been beastly about you. I am going
  to do all I possibly can to make up for it."</p>

  <p>She was a little hysterical and very much overwrought, and he decided not
  to press the question, though her words puzzled him.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going to stay?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am staying at the Savoy," she replied. "What am I to do?"</p>

  <p>In as few words as possible he told her where the ceremony was to be
  performed, and the hour at which she must leave the hotel.</p>

  <p>"We will take the night train for the Continent," he said.</p>

  <p>"But your work, Frank?"</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, blow work!" he cried hilariously. "I cannot think of work to-
  day."</p>

  <p>At two-fifteen he was waiting in the vestry for the girl's arrival,
  chatting with his friend the rector. He had arranged for the ceremony to be
  performed at two-thirty; and the witnesses, a glum verger and a woman engaged
  in cleaning the church, sat in the pews of the empty building, waiting to
  earn the guinea which they had been promised.</p>

  <p>The conversation was about nothing in particular&mdash;one of those empty,
  purposeless exchanges of banal thought and speech characteristic of such an
  occasion.</p>

  <p>At two-thirty Frank looked at his watch and walked out of the church to
  the end of the road. There was no sign of the girl. At two-forty-five he
  crossed to a providential tobacconist and telephoned to the Savoy and was
  told that the lady had left half an hour before.</p>

  <p>"She ought to be here very soon," he said to the priest. He was a little
  impatient, a little nervous, and terribly anxious.</p>

  <p>As the church clock struck three, the rector turned to him.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I cannot marry you to-day, Mr. Merrill," he said.</p>

  <p>Frank was very pale.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he asked quickly. "Miss Nuttall has probably been detained by
  the traffic or a burst tire. She will be here very shortly."</p>

  <p>The minister shook his head and hung up his white surplice in the
  cupboard.</p>

  <p>"The law of the land, my dear Mr. Merrill," he said, "does not allow
  weddings after three in the afternoon. You can come along to-morrow morning
  any time after eight."</p>

  <p>There was a tap at the door, and Frank swung round. It was not the girl,
  but a telegraph boy. He snatched the buff envelope from the lad's hand and
  tore it open. It read simply:</p>

  <p>The wedding cannot take place.</p>

  <p>It was unsigned.</p>

  <p>At two-fifteen that afternoon May had passed through the vestibule of the
  hotel, and her foot was on the step of the taxicab when a hand fell upon her
  arm, and she turned in alarm to meet the searching eyes of Jasper Cole.</p>

  <p>"Where are you off to in such a hurry, May?"</p>

  <p>She flushed and drew her arm away with a decisive gesture.</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to say to you, Jasper," she said coldly. "After your
  horrible charge against Frank, I never want to speak to you again."</p>

  <p>He winced a little, then smiled.</p>

  <p>"At least you can be civil to an old friend," he said good- humoredly,
  "and tell me where you are off to in such a hurry."</p>

  <p>Should she tell him? A moment's indecision, and then she spoke.</p>

  <p>"I am going to marry Frank Merrill," she said.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I thought as much. In that case, I am coming down to the church to make a
  scene."</p>

  <p>He said this with a smile on his lips; but there was no mistaking the
  resolution which showed in the thrust of his square jaw.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she said. "Don't be absurd, Jasper. My mind is made
  up."</p>

  <p>"I mean," he said quietly, "that I have Mr. Minute's power of attorney to
  act for him, and Mr. Minute happens to be your legal guardian. You are, in
  point of fact, my dear May, more or less of a ward, and you cannot marry
  before you are twenty-one without your guardian's consent."</p>

  <p>"I shall be twenty-one next week," she said defiantly.</p>

  <p>"Then," smiled the other, "wait till next week before you marry. There is
  no very pressing hurry."</p>

  <p>"You forced this situation upon me," said the girl hotly, "and I think it
  is very horrid of you. I am going to marry Frank to-day."</p>

  <p>"Under those circumstances, I must come down and forbid the marriage; and
  when our parson asks if there is any just cause I shall step forward to the
  rails, gayly flourishing the power of attorney, and not even the most
  hardened parson could continue in the face of that legal instrument. It is a
  mandamus, a caveat, and all sorts of horrific things."</p>

  <p>"Why are you doing this?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Because I have no desire that you shall marry a man who is certainly a
  forger, and possibly a murderer," said Jasper Cole calmly.</p>

  <p>"I won't listen to you!" she cried, and stepped into the waiting
  taxicab.</p>

  <p>Without a word, Jasper followed her.</p>

  <p>"You can't turn me out," he said, "and I know where you are going, anyway,
  because you were giving directions to the driver when I stood behind you. You
  had better let me go with you. I like the suburbs."</p>

  <p>She turned and faced him swiftly.</p>

  <p>"And Silvers Rents?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He went a shade paler.</p>

  <p>"What do you know about Silvers Rents?" he demanded, recovering himself
  with an effort.</p>

  <p>She did not reply.</p>

  <p>The taxicab was halfway to its destination before the girl spoke
  again:</p>

  <p>"Are you serious when you say you will forbid the marriage?"</p>

  <p>"Quite serious," he replied; "so much so that I shall bring in a policeman
  to witness my act."</p>

  <p>The girl was nearly in tears.</p>

  <p>"It is monstrous of you! Uncle wouldn't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Had you not better see your uncle?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Something told her that he would keep his word. She had a horror of
  scenes, and, worst of all, she feared the meeting of the two men under these
  circumstances. Suddenly she leaned forward and tapped the window, and the
  taxi slowed down.</p>

  <p>"Tell him to go back and call at the nearest telegraph office. I want to
  send a wire."</p>

  <p>"If it is to Mr. Frank Merrill," said Jasper smoothly, "you may save
  yourself the trouble. I have already wired."</p>

  <p>Frank came back to London in a pardonable fury. He drove straight to the
  hotel, only to learn that the girl had left again with her uncle. He looked
  at his watch. He had still some work to do at the bank, though he had little
  appetite for work.</p>

  <p>Yet it was to the bank he went. He threw a glance over the counter to the
  table and the chair where he had sat for so long and at which he was destined
  never to sit again, for as he was passing behind the counter Mr. Brandon met
  him.</p>

  <p>"Your uncle wishes to see you, Mr. Merrill," he said gravely.</p>

  <p>Frank hesitated, then walked into the office, closing the door behind him,
  and he noticed that Mr. Brandon did not attempt to follow.</p>

  <p>John Minute sat in the one easy chair and looked up heavily as Frank
  entered.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Frank," he said. "I have a lot of things to ask you."</p>

  <p>"And I've one or two things to ask you, uncle," said Frank calmly.</p>

  <p>"If it is about May, you can save yourself the trouble," said the other.
  "If it is about Mr. Rex Holland, I can give you a little information."</p>

  <p>Frank looked at him steadily.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite get your meaning, sir," he said, "though I gather there is
  something offensive behind what you have said."</p>

  <p>John Minute twisted round in the chair and threw one leg over its padded
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Frank," he said, "I want you to be perfectly straight with me, and I'll
  be as perfectly straight with you."</p>

  <p>The young man made no reply.</p>

  <p>"Certain facts have been brought to my attention, which leave no doubt in
  my mind as to the identity of the alleged Mr. Rex Holland," said John Minute
  slowly. "I don't relish saying this, because I have liked you, Frank, though
  I have sometimes stood in your way and we have not seen eye to eye together.
  Now, I want you to come down to Eastbourne to-morrow and have a
  heart-to-heart talk with me."</p>

  <p>"What do you expect I can tell you?" asked Frank quietly.</p>

  <p>"I want you to tell me the truth. I expect you won't," said John
  Minute.</p>

  <p>A half smile played for a second upon Frank's lips.</p>

  <p>"At any rate," he said, "you are being straight with me. I don't know
  exactly what you are driving at, uncle, but I gather that it is something
  rather unpleasant, and that somewhere in the background there is hovering an
  accusation against me. From the fact that you have mentioned Mr. Rex Holland
  or the gang which went by that name, I suppose that you are suggesting that I
  am an accomplice of that gentleman."</p>

  <p>"I suggest more than that," said the other quickly. "I suggest that you
  are Rex Holland."</p>

  <p>Frank laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>"It is no laughing matter," said John Minute sternly.</p>

  <p>"From your point of view it is not," said Frank, "but from my point of
  view it has certain humorous aspects, and unfortunately I am cursed with a
  sense of humor. I hardly know how I can go into the matter here" &mdash;he
  looked round&mdash;"for even if this is the time, it is certainly not the
  place, and I think I'll accept your invitation and come down to Weald Lodge
  to-morrow night. I gather you don't want to travel down with a master
  criminal who might at any moment take your watch and chain."</p>

  <p>"I wish you would look at this matter more seriously, Frank," said John
  Minute earnestly. "I want to get to the truth, and any truth which exonerates
  you will be very welcome to me."</p>

  <p>Frank nodded.</p>

  <p>"I will give you credit for that," he said. "You may expect me to- morrow.
  May I ask you as a personal favor that you will not discuss this matter with
  me in the presence of your admirable secretary? I have a feeling at the back
  of my mind that he is at the bottom of all this. Remember that he is as
  likely to know about Rex Holland as I.</p>

  <p>"There has been an audit at the bank," Frank went on, "and I am not so
  stupid that I don't understand what this has meant. There has also been a
  certain coldness in the attitude of Brandon, and I have intercepted
  suspicious and meaning glances from the clerks. I shall not be surprised,
  therefore, if you tell me that my books are not in order. But again I would
  point out to you that it is just as possible for Jasper, who has access to
  the bank at all hours of the day and night, to have altered them as it is for
  me.</p>

  <p>"I hasten to add," he said, with a smile, "that I don't accuse Jasper. He
  is such a machine, and I cannot imagine him capable of so much initiative as
  systematically to forge checks and falsify ledgers. I merely mention Jasper
  because I want to emphasize the injustice of putting any man under suspicion
  unless you have the strongest and most convincing proof of his guilt. To
  declare my innocence is unnecessary from my point of view, and probably from
  yours also; but I declare to you, Uncle John, that I know no more about this
  matter than you."</p>

  <p>He stood leaning on the desk and looking down at his uncle; and John
  Minute, with all his experience of men, and for all his suspicions, felt just
  a twinge of remorse. It was not to last long, however.</p>

  <p>"I shall expect you to-morrow," he said.</p>

  <p>Frank nodded, walked out of the room and out of the bank, and twenty- four
  pairs of speculative eyes followed him.</p>

  <p>A few hours later another curious scene was being enacted, this time near
  the town of East Grinstead. There is a lonely stretch of road across a heath,
  which is called, for some reason, Ashdown Forest. A car was drawn up on a
  patch of turf by the side of the heath. Its owner was sitting in a little
  clearing out of view of the road, sipping a cup of tea which his chauffeur
  had made. He finished this and watched his servant take the basket.</p>

  <p>"Come back to me when you have finished," he said.</p>

  <p>The man touched his hat and disappeared with the package, but returned
  again in a few minutes.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Feltham," said Mr. Rex Holland. "I dare say you think it was
  rather strange of me to give you that little commission the other day," said
  Mr. Holland, crossing his legs and leaning back against a tree.</p>

  <p>The chauffeur smiled uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I did," he said shortly.</p>

  <p>"Were you satisfied with what I gave you?" asked the man.</p>

  <p>The chauffeur shuffled his feet uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Quite satisfied, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"You seem a little distrait, Feltham; I mean a little upset about
  something. What is it?"</p>

  <p>The man coughed in embarrassed confusion.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," he began, "the fact is, I don't like it."</p>

  <p>"You don't like what? The five hundred pounds I gave you?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. It is not that, but it was a queer thing to ask me to do
  &mdash;pretend to be you and send a commissionaire to the bank for your
  money, and then get away out of London to a quiet little hole like
  Bilstead."</p>

  <p>"So you think it was queer?"</p>

  <p>The chauffeur nodded.</p>

  <p>"The fact is, sir," he blurted out, "I've seen the papers."</p>

  <p>The other nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I presume you mean the newspapers. And what is there in the newspapers
  that interests you?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Holland took a gold case from his pocket, opened it languidly, and
  selected a cigarette. He was closing it when he caught the chauffeur's eye
  and tossed a cigarette to him.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," said the man.</p>

  <p>"What was it you didn't like?" asked Mr. Holland again, passing a
  match.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I've been in all sorts of queer places," said Feltham
  doggedly, as he puffed away at the cigarette, "but I've always managed to
  keep clear of anything&mdash;funny. Do you see what I mean?"</p>

  <p>"By funny I presume you don't mean comic," said Mr. Rex Holland
  cheerfully. "You mean dishonest, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"That's right, sir, and there's no doubt that I have been in a swindle,
  and it's worrying me&mdash;that bank-forgery case. Why, I read my own
  description in the paper!"</p>

  <p>Beads of perspiration stood upon the little man's forehead, and there was
  a pathetic droop to his mouth.</p>

  <p>"That is a distinction which falls to few of us," said his employer
  suavely. "You ought to feel highly honored. And what are you going to do
  about it, Feltham?"</p>

  <p>The man looked to left and right as though seeking some friend in need who
  would step forth with ready-made advice.</p>

  <p>"The only thing I can do, sir," he said, "is to give myself up."</p>

  <p>"And give me up, too," said the other, with a little laugh. "Oh, no, my
  dear Feltham. Listen; I will tell you something. A few weeks ago I had a very
  promising valet chauffeur just like you. He was an admirable man, and he was
  also a foreigner. I believe he was a Swede. He came to me under exactly the
  same circumstances as you arrived, and he received exactly the same
  instructions as you have received, which unfortunately he did not carry out
  to the letter. I caught him pilfering from me&mdash;a few trinkets of no
  great value&mdash;and, instead of the foolish fellow repenting, he blurted
  out the one fact which I did not wish him to know, and incidentally which I
  did not wish anybody in the world to know.</p>

  <p>"He knew who I was. He had seen me in the West End and had discovered my
  identity. He even sought an interview with some one to whom it would have
  been inconvenient to have made known my&mdash;character. I promised to find
  him another job, but he had already decided upon changing and had cut out an
  advertisement from a newspaper. I parted friendly with him, wished him luck,
  and he went off to interview his possible employer, smoking one of my
  cigarettes just as you are smoking&mdash;and he threw it away, I have no
  doubt, just as you have thrown it away when it began to taste a little
  bitter."</p>

  <p>"Look here!" said the chauffeur, and scrambled to his feet. "If you try
  any monkey tricks with me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Holland eyed him with interest.</p>

  <p>"If you try any monkey tricks with me," said the chauffeur thickly,
  "I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He pitched forward on his face and lay still.</p>

  <p>Mr. Holland waited long enough to search his pockets, and then, stepping
  cautiously into the road, donned the chauffeur's cap and goggles and set his
  car running swiftly southward.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">X. A MURDER</a></h2>

  <p>Constable Wiseman lived in the bosom of his admiring family in a small
  cottage on the Bexhill Road. That "my father was a policeman" was the proud
  boast of two small boys, a boast which entitled them to no small amount of
  respect, because P. C. Wiseman was not only honored in his own circle but
  throughout the village in which he dwelt.</p>

  <p>He was, in the first place, a town policeman, as distinct from a county
  policeman, though he wore the badge and uniform of the Sussex constabulary.
  It was felt that a town policeman had more in common with crime, had a vaster
  experience, and was in consequence a more helpful adviser than a man whose
  duties began and ended in the patrolling of country lanes and law-abiding
  villages where nothing more exciting than an occasional dog fight or a charge
  of poaching served to fill the hiatus of constabulary life.</p>

  <p>Constable Wiseman was looked upon as a shrewd fellow, a man to whom might
  be brought the delicate problems which occasionally perplexed and confused
  the bucolic mind. He had settled the vexed question as to whether a policeman
  could or could not enter a house where a man was beating his wife, and had
  decided that such a trespass could only be committed if the lady involved
  should utter piercing cries of "Murder!"</p>

  <p>He added significantly that the constable who was called upon must be the
  constable on duty, and not an ornament of the force who by accident was a
  resident in their midst.</p>

  <p>The problem of the straying chicken and the egg that is laid on alien
  property, the point of law involved in the question as to when a servant
  should give notice and the date from which her notice should count &mdash;all
  these matters came within Constable Wiseman's purview, and were solved to the
  satisfaction of all who brought their little obscurities for solution.</p>

  <p>But it was in his own domestic circle that Constable
  Wiseman&mdash;appropriately named, as all agreed&mdash;shone with an
  effulgence that was almost dazzling, and was a source of irritation to the
  male relatives on his wife's side, one of whom had unfortunately come within
  the grasp of the law over a matter of a snared rabbit and was in consequence
  predisposed to anarchy in so far as the abolition of law and order affected
  the police force.</p>

  <p>Constable Wiseman sat at tea one summer evening, and about the spotless
  white cloth which covered the table was grouped all that Constable Wiseman
  might legally call his. Tea was a function, and to the younger members of the
  family meant just tea and bread and butter. To Constable Wiseman it meant
  luxuries of a varied and costly nature. His taste ranged from rump steak to
  Yarmouth bloaters, and once he had introduced a foreign
  delicacy&mdash;foreign to the village, which had never known before the
  reason for their existence&mdash;sweetbreads.</p>

  <p>The conversation, which was well sustained by Mr. Wiseman, was usually of
  himself, his wife being content to punctuate his autobiography with such
  encouraging phrases as, "Dear, dear!" "Well, whatever next!" the children
  doing no more than ask in a whisper for more food. This they did at regular
  and frequent intervals, but because of their whispers they were supposed to
  be unheard.</p>

  <p>Constable Wiseman spoke about himself because he knew of nothing more
  interesting to talk about. His evening conversation usually took the form of
  a very full r&eacute;sum&eacute; of his previous day's experience. He left
  the impression upon his wife&mdash;and glad enough she was to have such an
  impression&mdash;that Eastbourne was a well-conducted town mainly as a result
  of P. C. Wiseman's ceaseless and tireless efforts.</p>

  <p>"I never had a clew yet that I never follered to the bitter end," said the
  preening constable.</p>

  <p>"You remember when Raggett's orchard was robbed&mdash;who found the
  thieves?"</p>

  <p>"You did, of course; I'm sure you did," said Mrs. Wiseman, jigging her
  youngest on her knee, the youngest not having arrived at the age where he
  recognized the necessity for expressing his desires in whispers.</p>

  <p>"Who caught them three-card-trick men after the Lewes races last year?"
  went on Constable Wiseman passionately. "Who has had more summonses for
  smoking chimneys than any other man in the force? Some people," he added, as
  he rose heavily and took down his tunic, which hung on the wall &mdash;"some
  people would ask for promotion; but I'm perfectly satisfied. I'm not one of
  those ambitious sort. Why, I wouldn't know at all what to do with myself if
  they made me a sergeant."</p>

  <p>"You deserve it, anyway," said Mrs. Wiseman.</p>

  <p>"I don't deserve anything I don't want," said Mr. Wiseman loftily. "I've
  learned a few things, too, but I've never made use of what's come to me
  officially to get me pushed along. You'll hear something in a day or two," he
  said mysteriously, "and in high life, too, in a manner of speaking&mdash;that
  is, if you can call old Minute high life, which I very much doubt."</p>

  <p>"You don't say so!" said Mrs. Wiseman, appropriately amazed.</p>

  <p>Her husband nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"There's trouble up there," he said. "From certain information I've
  received, there has been a big row between young Mr. Merrill and the old man,
  and the C. I. D. people have been down about it. What's more," he said, "I
  could tell a thing or two. I've seen that boy look at the old man as though
  he'd like to kill him. You wouldn't believe it, would you, but I know, and it
  didn't happen so long ago either. He was always snubbing him when young
  Merrill was down here acting as his secretary, and as good as called him a
  fool in front of my face when I served him with that summons for having his
  lights up. You'll hear something one of these days."</p>

  <p>Constable Wiseman was an excellent prophet, vague as his prophecy was.</p>

  <p>He went out of the cottage to his duty in a complacent frame of mind,
  which was not unusual, for Constable Wiseman was nothing if not satisfied
  with his fate. His complacency continued until a little after seven o'clock
  that evening.</p>

  <p>It so happened that Constable Wiseman, no less than every other member of
  the force on duty that night, had much to think about, much that was at once
  exciting and absorbing. It had been whispered before the evening parade that
  Sergeant Smith was to leave the force. There was some talk of his being
  dismissed, but it was clear that he had been given the opportunity of
  resigning, for he was still doing duty, which would not have been the case
  had he been forcibly removed.</p>

  <p>Sergeant Smith's mien and attitude had confirmed the rumor. Nobody was
  surprised, since this dour officer had been in trouble before. Twice had he
  been before the deputy chief constable for neglect of, and being drunk while
  on, duty. On the earlier occasions he had had remarkable escapes. Some people
  talked of influence, but it is more likely that the man's record had helped
  him, for he was a first-class policeman with a nose for crime, absolutely
  fearless, and had, moreover, assisted in the capture of one or two very
  desperate criminals who had made their way to the south-coast town.</p>

  <p>His last offense, however, was too grave to overlook. His inspector, going
  the rounds, had missed him, and after a search he was discovered outside a
  public house. It is no great crime to be found outside a public house,
  particularly when an officer has a fairly extensive area to cover, and in
  this respect he was well within the limits of that area. But it must be
  explained that the reason the sergeant was outside the public house was
  because he had challenged a fellow carouser to fight, and at the moment he
  was discovered he was stripped to the waist and setting about his task with
  rare workmanlike skill.</p>

  <p>He was also drunk.</p>

  <p>To have retained his services thereafter would have been little less than
  a crying scandal. There is no doubt, however, that Sergeant Smith had made a
  desperate attempt to use the influence behind him, and use it to its fullest
  extent.</p>

  <p>He had had one stormy interview with John Minute, and had planned another.
  Constable Wiseman, patrolling the London Road, his mind filled with the great
  news, was suddenly confronted with the object of his thoughts. The sergeant
  rode up to where the constable was standing in a professional attitude at the
  corner of two roads, and jumped off with the manner of a man who has an
  object in view.</p>

  <p>"Wiseman," he said&mdash;and his voice was such as to suggest that he had
  been drinking again&mdash;"where will you be at ten o'clock to- night?"</p>

  <p>Constable Wiseman raised his eyes in thought.</p>

  <p>"At ten o'clock, Sergeant, I shall be opposite the gates of the
  cemetery."</p>

  <p>The sergeant looked round left and right.</p>

  <p>"I am going to see Mr. Minute on a matter of business," he said, "and you
  needn't mention the fact."</p>

  <p>"I keep myself to myself," began Constable Wiseman. "What I see with one
  eye goes out of the other, in the manner of speaking&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The sergeant nodded, stepped on to his bicycle again, turned it about, and
  went at full speed down the gentle incline toward Weald Lodge. He made no
  secret of his visit, but rode through the wide gates up the gravel drive to
  the front of the house, rang the bell, and to the servant who answered
  demanded peremptorily to see Mr. Minute.</p>

  <p>John Minute received him in the library, where the previous interviews had
  taken place. Minute waited until the servant had gone and the door was
  closed, and then he said:</p>

  <p>"Now, Crawley, there's no sense in coming to me; I can do nothing for
  you."</p>

  <p>The sergeant put his helmet on the table, walked to a sideboard where a
  tray and decanter stood, and poured himself out a stiff dose of whisky
  without invitation. John Minute watched him without any great resentment.
  This was not civilized Eastbourne they were in. They were back in the old
  free-and-easy days of Gwelo, where men did not expect invitations to
  drink.</p>

  <p>Smith&mdash;or Crawley, to give him his real name&mdash;tossed down half a
  tumbler of neat whisky and turned, wiping his heavy mustache with the back of
  his hand.</p>

  <p>"So you can't do anything, can't you?" he mimicked. "Well, I'm going to
  show you that you can, and that you will!"</p>

  <p>He put up his hand to check the words on John Minute's lips.</p>

  <p>"There's no sense in your putting that rough stuff over me about your
  being able to send me to jail, because you wouldn't do it. It doesn't suit
  your book, John Minute, to go into the court and testify against me. Too many
  things would come out in the witness box, and you well know it
  &mdash;besides, Rhodesia is a long way off!"</p>

  <p>"I know a place which isn't so far distant," said the other, looking up
  from his chair&mdash;"a place called Felixstowe, for example. There's another
  place called Cromer. I've been in consultation with a gentleman you may have
  heard of, a Mr. Saul Arthur Mann."</p>

  <p>"Saul Arthur Mann," repeated the other slowly. "I've never heard of
  him."</p>

  <p>"You would not, but he has heard of you," said John Minute calmly. "The
  fact is, Crawley, there's a big bad record against you, between your serious
  crimes in Rhodesia and your blackmail of to-day. I've a few facts about you
  which will interest you. I know the date you came to this country, which I
  didn't know before, and I know how you earned your living until you found me.
  I know of some shares in a non-existent Rhodesian mine which you sold to a
  feeble-minded gentleman at Cromer, and to a lady, equally feeble-minded, at
  Felixstowe. I've not only got the shares you sold, with your signature as a
  director, but I have letters and receipts signed by you. It has cost me a lot
  of money to get them, but it was well worth it."</p>

  <p>Crawley's face was livid. He took a step toward the other, but recoiled,
  for at the first hint of danger John Minute had pulled the revolver he
  invariably carried.</p>

  <p>"Keep just where you are, Crawley!" he said. "You are close enough now to
  be unpleasant."</p>

  <p>"So you've got my record, have you?" said the other, with an oath. "Tucked
  away with your marriage lines, I'll bet, and the certificate of birth of the
  kids you left to starve with their mother."</p>

  <p>"Get out of here!" said Minute, with dangerous quiet. "Get away while
  you're safe!"</p>

  <p>There was something in his eye which cowed the half-drunken man who,
  turning with a laugh, picked up his helmet and walked from the room.</p>

  <p>The hour was seven-thirty-five by Constable Wiseman's watch; for, slowly
  patrolling back, he saw the sergeant come flying out of the gateway on his
  bicycle and turn down toward the town. Constable Wiseman subsequently
  explained that he looked at his watch because he had a regular point at which
  he should meet Sergeant Smith at seven-forty-five and he was wondering
  whether his superior would return.</p>

  <p>The chronology of the next three hours has been so often given in various
  accounts of the events which marked that evening that I may be excused if I
  give them in detail.</p>

  <p>A car, white with dust, turned into the stable yard of the Star Hotel,
  Maidstone. The driver, in a dust coat and a chauffeur's cap, descended and
  handed over the car to a garage keeper with instructions to clean it up and
  have it filled ready for him the following morning. He gave explicit
  instructions as to the number of tins of petrol he required to carry always
  and tipped the garage keeper handsomely in advance.</p>

  <p>He was described as a young man with a slight black mustache, and he was
  wearing his motor goggles when he went into the office of the hotel and
  ordered a bed and a sitting room. Therefore his face was not seen. When his
  dinner was served, it was remarked by the waiter that his goggles were still
  on his face. He gave instructions that the whole of the dinner was to be
  served at once and put upon the sideboard, and that he did not wish to be
  disturbed until he rang the bell.</p>

  <p>When the bell rang the waiter came to find the room empty. But from the
  adjoining room he received orders to have breakfast by seven o'clock the
  following morning.</p>

  <p>At seven o'clock the driver of the car paid his bill, his big motor
  goggles still upon his face, again tipped the garage keeper handsomely, and
  drove his car from the yard. He turned to the right and appeared to be taking
  the London Road, but later in the day, as has been established, the car was
  seen on its way to Paddock Wood, and was later observed at Tonbridge. The
  driver pulled up at a little tea house half a mile from the town, ordered
  sandwiches and tea, which were brought to him, and which he consumed in the
  car.</p>

  <p>Late in the afternoon the car was seen at Uckfield, and the theory
  generally held was that the driver was killing time. At the wayside cottage
  at which he stopped for tea&mdash;it was one of those little places that
  invite cyclists by an ill-printed board to tarry a while and refresh
  themselves&mdash;he had some conversation with the tenant of the cottage, a
  widow. She seems to have been the usual loquacious, friendly soul who tells
  one without reserve her business, her troubles, and a fair sprinkling of the
  news of the day in the shortest possible time.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen a paper," said Rex Holland politely. "It is a very curious
  thing that I never thought about newspapers."</p>

  <p>"I can get you one," said the woman eagerly. "You ought to read about that
  case."</p>

  <p>"The dead chauffeur?" asked Rex Holland interestedly, for that had been
  the item of general news which was foremost in the woman's conversation.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; he was murdered in Ashdown Forest. Many's the time I've driven
  over there."</p>

  <p>"How do you know it was a murder?"</p>

  <p>She knew for many reasons. Her brother-in-law was gamekeeper to Lord
  Ferring, and a colleague of his had been the man who had discovered the body,
  and it had appeared, as the good lady explained, that this same chauffeur was
  a man for whom the police had been searching in connection with a bank
  robbery about which much had appeared in the newspapers of the day
  previous.</p>

  <p>"How very interesting!" said Mr. Holland, and took the paper from her
  hand.</p>

  <p>He read the description line by line. He learned that the police were in
  possession of important clews, and that they were on the track of the man who
  had been seen in the company of the chauffeur. Moreover, said a most
  indiscreet newspaper writer, the police had a photograph showing the
  chauffeur standing by the side of his car, and reproductions of this
  photograph, showing the type of machine, were being circulated.</p>

  <p>"How very interesting!" said Mr. Rex Holland again, being perfectly
  content in his mind, for his search of the body had revealed copies of this
  identical picture, and the car in which he was seated was not the car which
  had been photographed. From this point, a mile and a half beyond Uckfield,
  all trace of the car and its occupant was lost.</p>

  <p>The writer has been very careful to note the exact times and to confirm
  those about which there was any doubt. At nine-twenty on the night when
  Constable Wiseman had patrolled the road before Weald Lodge and had seen
  Sergeant Smith flying down the road on his bicycle, and on the night of that
  day when Mr. Rex Holland had been seen at Uckfield, there arrived by the
  London train, which is due at Eastbourne at nine-twenty, Frank Merrill. The
  train, as a matter of fact, was three minutes late, and Frank, who had been
  in the latter part of the train, was one of the last of the passengers to
  arrive at the barrier.</p>

  <p>When he reached the barrier, he discovered that he had no railway ticket,
  a very ordinary and vexatious experience which travelers before now have
  endured. He searched in every pocket, including the pocket of the light
  ulster he wore, but without success. He was vexed, but he laughed because he
  had a strong sense of humor.</p>

  <p>"I could pay for my ticket," he smiled, "but I be hanged if I will!
  Inspector, you search that overcoat."</p>

  <p>The amused inspector complied while Frank again went through all his
  pockets. At his request he accompanied the inspector to the latter's office,
  and there deposited on the table the contents of his pockets, his money,
  letters, and pocketbook.</p>

  <p>"You're used to searching people," he said. "See if you can find it. I'll
  swear I've got it about me somewhere."</p>

  <p>The obliging inspector felt, probed, but without success, till suddenly,
  with a roar of laughter, Frank cried:</p>

  <p>"What a stupid ass I am! I've got it in my hat!"</p>

  <p>He took off his hat, and there in the lining was a first-class ticket from
  London to Eastbourne.</p>

  <p>It is necessary to lay particular stress upon this incident, which had an
  important bearing upon subsequent events. He called a taxicab, drove to Weald
  Lodge, and dismissed the driver in the road. He arrived at Weald Lodge, by
  the testimony of the driver and by that of Constable Wiseman, whom the car
  had passed, at about nine-forty.</p>

  <p>Mr. John Minute at this time was alone; his suspicious nature would not
  allow the presence of servants in the house during the interview which he was
  to have with his nephew. He regarded servants as spies and eavesdroppers, and
  perhaps there was an excuse for his uncharitable view.</p>

  <p>At nine-fifty, ten minutes after Frank had entered the gates of Weald
  Lodge, a car with gleaming headlights came quickly from the opposite
  direction and pulled up outside the gates. P. C. Wiseman, who at this moment
  was less than fifty yards from the gate, saw a man descend and pass quickly
  into the grounds of the house.</p>

  <p>At nine-fifty-two or nine-fifty-three the constable, walking slowly toward
  the house, came abreast of the wall, and, looking up, saw a light flash for a
  moment in one of the upper windows. He had hardly seen this when he heard two
  shots fired in rapid succession, and a cry.</p>

  <p>Only for a moment did P. C. Wiseman hesitate. He jumped the low wall,
  pushed through the shrubs, and made for the side of the house from whence a
  flood of light fell from the open French windows of the library. He blundered
  into the room a pace or two, and then stopped, for the sight was one which
  might well arrest even as unimaginative a man as a county constable.</p>

  <p>John Minute lay on the floor on his back, and it did not need a doctor to
  tell that he was dead. By his side, and almost within reach of his hand, was
  a revolver of a very heavy army pattern. Mechanically the constable picked up
  the revolver and turned his stern face to the other occupant of the room.</p>

  <p>"This is a bad business, Mr. Merrill," he found his breath to say.</p>

  <p>Frank Merrill had been leaning over his uncle as the constable entered,
  but now stood erect, pale, but perfectly self-possessed.</p>

  <p>"I heard the shot and I came in," he said.</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are," said the constable, and, stepping quickly out on to
  the lawn, he blew his whistle long and shrilly, then returned to the
  room.</p>

  <p>"This is a bad business, Mr. Merrill," he repeated.</p>

  <p>"It is a very bad business," said the other in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Is this revolver yours?"</p>

  <p>Frank shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've never seen it before," he said with emphasis.</p>

  <p>The constable thought as quickly as it was humanly possible for him to
  think. He had no doubt in his mind that this unhappy youth had fired the
  shots which had ended the life of the man on the floor.</p>

  <p>"Stay here," he said again, and again went out to blow his whistle. He
  walked this time on the lawn by the side of the drive toward the road. He had
  not taken half a dozen steps when he saw a dark figure of a man creeping
  stealthily along before him in the shade of the shrubs. In a second the
  constable was on him, had grasped him and swung him round, flashing his
  lantern into his prisoner's face. Instantly he released his hold.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, Sergeant," he stammered.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" scowled the other. "What's wrong with you,
  Constable?"</p>

  <p>Sergeant Smith's face was drawn and haggard. The policeman looked at him
  with open-mouthed astonishment.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know it was you," he said.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" asked the other again, and his voice was cracked and
  unnatural.</p>

  <p>"There's been a murder&mdash;old Minute&mdash;shot!"</p>

  <p>Sergeant Smith staggered back a pace.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he said. "Minute murdered? Then he did it! The young devil did
  it!"</p>

  <p>"Come and have a look," invited Wiseman, recovering his balance. "I've got
  his nephew."</p>

  <p>"No, no! I don't want to see John Minute dead! You go back. I'll bring
  another constable and a doctor."</p>

  <p>He stumbled blindly along the drive into the road, and Constable Wiseman
  went back to the house. Frank was where he had left him, save that he had
  seated himself and was gazing steadfastly upon the dead man. He looked up as
  the policeman entered.</p>

  <p>"What have you done?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The sergeant's gone for a doctor and another constable," said Wiseman
  gravely.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid they will be too late," said Frank. "He is&mdash;What's
  that?"</p>

  <p>There was a distant hammering and a faint voice calling for help.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" whispered Frank again.</p>

  <p>The constable strode through the open doorway to the foot of the stairs
  and listened. The sound came from the upper story. He ran upstairs, mounting
  two at a time, and presently located the noise. It came from an end room, and
  somebody was hammering on the panels. The door was locked, but the key had
  been left in the lock, and this Constable Wiseman turned, flooding the dark
  interior with light.</p>

  <p>"Come out!" he said, and Jasper Cole staggered out, dazed and shaking.</p>

  <p>"Somebody hit me on the head with a sandbag," he said thickly. "I heard
  the shot. What has happened?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Minute has been killed," said the policeman.</p>

  <p>"Killed!" He fell back against the wall, his face working. "Killed!" he
  repeated. "Not killed!"</p>

  <p>The constable nodded. He had found the electric switch and the passageway
  was illuminated.</p>

  <p>Presently the young man mastered his emotion.</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" he asked, and Wiseman led the way downstairs.</p>

  <p>Jasper Cole walked into the room without a glance at Frank and bent over
  the dead man. For a long time he looked at him earnestly, then he turned to
  Frank.</p>

  <p>"You did this!" he said. "I heard your voice and the shots! I heard you
  threaten him!"</p>

  <p>Frank said nothing. He merely stared at the other, and in his eyes was a
  look of infinite scorn.</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11">XI. THE CASE AGAINST FRANK MERRILL</a></h2>

  <p>Mr. Saul Arthur Mann stood by the window of his office and moodily watched
  the traffic passing up and down this busy city street at what was the busiest
  hour of the day. He stood there such a long time that the girl who had sought
  his help thought he must have forgotten her.</p>

  <p>May was pale, and her pallor was emphasized by the black dress she wore.
  The terrible happening of a week before had left its impression upon her. For
  her it had been a week of sleepless nights, a week's anguish of mind
  unspeakable. Everybody had been most kind, and Jasper was as gentle as a
  woman. Such was the influence that he exercised over her that she did not
  feel any sense of resentment against him, even though she knew that he was
  the principal witness for the crown. He was so sincere, so honest in his
  sympathy, she told herself.</p>

  <p>He was so free from any bitterness against the man who he believed had
  killed his best friend and his most generous employer that she could not
  sustain the first feeling of resentment she had felt. Perhaps it was because
  her great sorrow overshadowed all other emotions; yet she was free to analyze
  her friendship with the man who was working day and night to send the man who
  loved her to a felon's doom. She could not understand herself; still less
  could she understand Jasper.</p>

  <p>She looked up again at Mr. Mann as he stood by the window, his hands
  clasped behind him; and as she did so he turned slowly and came back to where
  she sat. His usually jocund face was lugubrious and worried.</p>

  <p>"I have given more thought to this matter than I've given to any other
  problem I have tackled," he said. "I believe Mr. Merrill to be falsely
  accused, and I have one or two points to make to his counsel which, when they
  are brought forward in court, will prove beyond any doubt whatever that he
  was innocent. I don't believe that matters are so black against him as you
  think. The other side will certainly bring forward the forgery and the
  doctored books to supply a motive for the murder. Inspector Nash is in charge
  of the case, and he promised to call here at four o'clock."</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"It wants three minutes. Have you any suggestion to offer?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I can floor the prosecution," Mr. Mann went on, "but what I cannot do is
  to find the murderer for certain. It is obviously one of three men. It is
  either Sergeant Crawley, alias Smith, about whose antecedents Mr. Minute made
  an inquiry, or Jasper Cole, the secretary, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>It was not necessary to say who was the third suspect.</p>

  <p>There came a knock at the door, and the clerk announced Inspector Nash.
  That stout and stoical officer gave a noncommittal nod to Mr. Mann and a
  smiling recognition to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Well, you know how matters stand, Inspector," said Mr. Mann briskly, "and
  I thought I'd ask you to come here to-day to straighten a few things
  out."</p>

  <p>"It is rather irregular, Mr. Mann," said the inspector, "but as they've no
  objection at headquarters, I don't mind telling you, within limits, all that
  I know; but I don't suppose I can tell you any more than you have found out
  for yourself."</p>

  <p>"Do you really think Mr. Merrill committed this crime?" asked the
  girl.</p>

  <p>The inspector raised his eyebrows and pursed his lips.</p>

  <p>"It looks uncommonly like it, miss," he said. "We have evidence that the
  bank has been robbed, and it is almost certainly proved that Merrill had
  access to the books and was the only person in the bank who could have faked
  the figures and transferred the money from one account to another without
  being found out. There are still one or two doubtful points to be cleared up,
  but there is the motive, and when you've got the motive you are three parts
  on your way to finding the criminal. It isn't a straightforward case by any
  means," he confessed, "and the more I go into it the more puzzled I am. I
  don't mind telling you this frankly: I have seen Constable Wiseman, who
  swears that at the moment the shots were fired he saw a light flash in the
  upper window. We have the statement of Mr. Cole that he was in his room, his
  employer having requested that he should make himself scarce when the nephew
  came, and he tells us how somebody opened the door quietly and flashed an
  electric torch upon him."</p>

  <p>"What was Cole doing in the dark?" asked Mann quickly.</p>

  <p>"He had a headache and was lying down," said the inspector. "When he saw
  the light he jumped up and made for it, and was immediately slugged; the door
  closed upon him and was locked. Between his leaving the bed and reaching the
  door he heard Mr. Merrill's voice threatening his uncle, and the shots.
  Immediately afterward he was rendered insensible."</p>

  <p>"A curious story," said Saul Arthur Mann dryly. "A very curious
  story!"</p>

  <p>The girl felt an unaccountable and altogether amazing desire to defend
  Jasper against the innuendo in the other's tone, and it was with difficulty
  that she restrained herself.</p>

  <p>"I don't think it is a good story," said the inspector frankly; "but that
  is between ourselves. And then, of course," he went on, "we have the
  remarkable behavior of Sergeant Smith."</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" asked Mr. Mann.</p>

  <p>The inspector shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Sergeant Smith has disappeared," he said, "though I dare say we shall
  find him before long. He is only one; the most puzzling element of all is the
  fourth man concerned, the man who arrived in the motor car and who was
  evidently Mr. Rex Holland. We have got a very full description of him."</p>

  <p>"I also have a very full description of him," said Mr. Mann quietly; "but
  I've been unable to identify him with any of the people in my records."</p>

  <p>"Anyway, it was his car; there is no doubt about that."</p>

  <p>"And he was the murderer," said Mr. Mann. "I've no doubt about that, nor
  have you."</p>

  <p>"I have doubts about everything," replied the inspector
  diplomatically.</p>

  <p>"What was in the car?" asked the little man brightly. He was rapidly
  recovering his good humor.</p>

  <p>"That I am afraid I cannot tell you," smiled the detective.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll tell you," said Saul Arthur Mann, and, stepping up to his desk,
  took a memorandum from a drawer. "There were two motor rugs, two holland
  coats, one white, one brown. There were two sets of motor goggles. There was
  a package of revolver cartridges, from which six had been extracted, a
  leather revolver holster, a small garden trowel, and one or two other little
  things."</p>

  <p>Inspector Nash swore softly under his breath.</p>

  <p>"I'm blessed if I know how you found all that out," he said, with a little
  asperity in his voice. "The car was not touched or searched until we came on
  the scene, and, beyond myself and Sergeant Mannering of my department, nobody
  knows what the car contained."</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann smiled, and it was a very happy and triumphant smile.</p>

  <p>"You see, I know!" he purred. "That is one point in Merrill's favor."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed the detective, and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Why do you smile, Mr. Nash?" asked the little man suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of a county policeman who seems to have some extraordinary
  theories on the subject."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you mean Wiseman," said Mann, with a grin. "I've interviewed that
  gentleman. There is a great detective lost in him, Inspector."</p>

  <p>"It is lost, all right," said the detective laconically. "Wiseman is very
  certain that Merrill committed the crime, and I think you are going to have a
  difficulty in persuading a jury that he didn't. You see Merrill's story is
  that he came and saw his uncle, that they had a few minutes' chat together,
  that his uncle suddenly had an attack of faintness, and that he went out of
  the room into the dining room to get a glass of water. While Merrill was in
  the dining room he heard the shots, and came running back, still with the
  glass in his hand, and saw his uncle lying on the ground. I saw the glass,
  which was half filled.</p>

  <p>"I was also there in time to examine the dining room and see that Mr.
  Merrill had spilled some of the water when he was taking it from the carafe.
  All that part of the story is circumstantially sound. What we cannot
  understand, and what a jury will never understand, is how, in the very short
  space of time, the murderer could have got into the room and made his escape
  again."</p>

  <p>"The French windows were open," said Mr. Mann. "All the evidence that we
  have is to this effect, including the evidence of P. C. Wiseman."</p>

  <p>"In those circumstances, how comes it that the constable, who, when he
  heard the shot, made straight for the room, did not meet the murderer
  escaping? He saw nobody in the grounds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Except Sergeant Smith, or Crawley," interspersed Saul Arthur Mann
  readily. "I have reason to believe, and, indeed, reason to know, that
  Sergeant Smith, or Crawley, had a motive for being in the house. I supplied
  Mr. Minute, who was a client of mine, with certain documents, and those
  documents were in a safe in his bedroom. What is more likely than that this
  Crawley, to whom it was vitally necessary that the documents in question
  should be recovered, should have entered the house in search of those
  documents? I don't mind telling you that they related to a fraud of which he
  was the author, and they were in themselves all the proof which the police
  would require to obtain a conviction against him. He was obviously the man
  who struck down Mr. Cole, and whose light the constable saw flashing in the
  upper window."</p>

  <p>"In that case he cannot have been the murderer," said the detective
  quickly, "because the shots were fired while he was still in the room. They
  were almost simultaneous with the appearance of the flash at the upper
  window."</p>

  <p>"H'm!" said Saul Arthur Mann, for the moment nonplussed.</p>

  <p>"The more you go into this matter, the more complicated does it become,"
  said the police officer, with a shake of his head, "and to my mind the
  clearer is the case against Merrill."</p>

  <p>"With this reservation," interrupted the other, "that you have to account
  for the movements of Mr. Rex Holland, who comes on the scene ten minutes
  after Frank Merrill arrives and who leaves his car. He leaves his car for a
  very excellent reason," he went on. "Sergeant Smith, who runs away to get
  assistance, meets two men of the Sussex constabulary, hurrying in response to
  Wiseman's whistle. One of them stands by the car, and the other comes into
  the house. It was, therefore, impossible for the murderer to make use of the
  car. Here is another point I would have you explain."</p>

  <p>He had hoisted himself on the edge of his desk, and sat, an amusing little
  figure, his legs swinging a foot from the ground.</p>

  <p>"The revolver used was a big Webley, not an easy thing to carry or conceal
  about your person, and undoubtedly brought to the scene of the crime by the
  man in the car. You will say that Merrill, who wore an overcoat, might have
  easily brought it in his pocket; but the absolute proof that that could not
  have been the case is that on his arrival by train from London, Mr. Merrill
  lost his ticket and very carefully searched himself, a railway inspector
  assisting, to discover the bit of pasteboard. He turned out everything he had
  in his pocket in the inspector's presence, and his overcoat&mdash;the only
  place where he could have concealed such a heavy weapon&mdash;was searched by
  the inspector himself."</p>

  <p>The detective nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is a very difficult case," he agreed, "and one in which I've no great
  heart; for, to be absolutely honest, my views are that while it might have
  been Merrill, the balance of proof is that it was not. That is, of course, my
  unofficial view, and I shall work pretty hard to secure a conviction."</p>

  <p>"I am sure you will," said Mr. Mann heartily.</p>

  <p>"Must the case go into the court?" asked the girl anxiously.</p>

  <p>"There is no other way for it," replied the officer. "You see, we have
  arrested him, and unless something turns up the magistrate must commit him
  for trial on the evidence we have secured."</p>

  <p>"Poor Frank!" she said softly.</p>

  <p>"It is rough on him, if he is innocent," agreed Nash, "but it is lucky for
  him if he's guilty. My experience of crime and criminals is that it is
  generally the obvious man who commits that crime; only once in fifty years is
  he innocent, whether he is acquitted or whether he is found guilty."</p>

  <p>He offered his hand to Mr. Mann.</p>

  <p>"I'll be getting along now, sir," he said. "The commissioner asked me to
  give you all the assistance I possibly could, and I hope I have done so."</p>

  <p>"What are you doing in the case of Jasper Cole?" asked Mann quickly.</p>

  <p>The detective smiled.</p>

  <p>"You ought to know, sir," he said, and was amused at his own little
  joke.</p>

  <p>"Well, young lady," said Mann, turning to the girl, after the detective
  had gone, "I think you know how matters stand. Nash suspects Cole."</p>

  <p>"Jasper!" she said, in shocked surprise.</p>

  <p>"Jasper," he repeated.</p>

  <p>"But that is impossible! He was locked in his room."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't make it impossible. I know of fourteen distinct cases of men
  who committed crimes and were able to lock themselves in their rooms, leaving
  the key outside. There was a case of Henry Burton, coiner; there was William
  Francis Rector, who killed a warder while in prison and locked the cell upon
  himself from the inside. There was&mdash;But there; why should I bother you
  with instances? That kind of trick is common enough. No," he said, "it is the
  motive that we have to find. Do you still want me to go with you to-morrow,
  Miss Nuttall?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I should be very glad if you would," she said earnestly. "Poor, dear
  uncle! I didn't think I could ever enter the house again."</p>

  <p>"I can relieve your mind about that," he said. "The will is not to be read
  in the house. Mr. Minute's lawyers have arranged for the reading at their
  offices in Lincoln's Inn Fields. I have the address here somewhere."</p>

  <p>He fumbled in his pocket and took out a card.</p>

  <p>"Power, Commons &amp; Co.," he read, "194 Lincoln's Inn Fields. I will
  meet you there at three o'clock."</p>

  <p>He rumpled his untidy hair with an embarrassed laugh.</p>

  <p>"I seem to have drifted into the position of guardian to you, young lady,"
  he said. "I can't say that it is an unpleasant task, although it is a great
  responsibility."</p>

  <p>"You have been splendid, Mr. Mann," she said warmly, "and I shall never
  forget all you have done for me. Somehow I feel that Frank will get off; and
  I hope&mdash;I pray that it will not be at Jasper's expense."</p>

  <p>He looked at her in surprise and disappointment.</p>

  <p>"I thought&mdash;" he stopped.</p>

  <p>"You thought I was engaged to Frank, and so I am," she said, with
  heightened color. "But Jasper is&mdash;I hardly know how to put it."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Mr. Mann, though, if the truth be told, he saw nothing which
  enlightened him.</p>

  <p>Punctually at three o'clock the next afternoon, they walked up the steps
  of the lawyers' office together. Jasper Cole was already there, and to Mr.
  Mann's surprise so also was Inspector Nash, who explained his presence in a
  few words.</p>

  <p>"There may be something in the will which will open a new viewpoint," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Power, the solicitor, an elderly man, inclined to rotundity, was
  introduced, and, taking his position before the fireplace, opened the
  proceedings with an expression of regret as to the circumstances which had
  brought them together.</p>

  <p>"The will of my late client," he said, "was not drawn up by me. It is
  written in Mr. Minute's handwriting, and revokes the only other will, one
  which was prepared some four years ago and which made provisions rather
  different to those in the present instrument. This will"&mdash;he took a
  single sheet of paper out of an envelope&mdash;"was made last year and was
  witnessed by Thomas Wellington Crawley"&mdash;he adjusted his pince-nez and
  examined the signature&mdash;"late trooper of the Matabeleland mounted
  police, and by George Warrell, who was Mr. Minute's butler at the time.
  Warrell died in the Eastbourne hospital in the spring of this year."</p>

  <p>There was a deep silence. Saul Arthur Mann's face was eagerly thrust
  forward, his head turned slightly to one side. Inspector Nash showed an
  unusual amount of interest. Both men had the same thought&mdash;a new will,
  witnessed by two people, one of whom was dead, and the other a fugitive from
  justice; what did this will contain?</p>

  <p>It was the briefest of documents. To his ward he left the sum of two
  hundred thousand pounds, "a provision which was also made in the previous
  will, I might add," said the lawyer, and to this he added all his shares in
  the Gwelo Deep.</p>

  <p>"To his nephew, Francis Merrill, he left twenty thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>The lawyer paused and looked round the little circle, and then
  continued:</p>

  <p>"The residue of my property, movable and immovable, all my furniture,
  leases, shares, cash at bankers, and all interests whatsoever, I bequeath to
  Jasper Cole, so-called, who is at present my secretary and confidential
  agent."</p>

  <p>The detective and Saul Arthur Mann exchanged glances, and Nash's lips
  moved.</p>

  <p>"How is that for a 'motive'?" he whispered.</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap12"
     id="chap12">XII. THE TRIAL OF FRANK MERRILL</a></h2>

  <p>The trial of Frank Merrill on the charge that he "did on the twenty-
  eighth day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred
  &mdash;wilfully and wickedly kill and slay by a pistol shot John Minute" was
  the sensation of a season which was unusually prolific in murder trials. The
  trial took place at the Lewes Assizes in a crowded courtroom, and lasted, as
  we know, for sixteen days, five days of which were given to the examination
  in chief and the cross-examination of the accountants who had gone into the
  books of the bank.</p>

  <p>The prosecution endeavored to establish the fact that no other person but
  Frank Merrill could have access to the books, and that therefore no other
  person could have falsified them or manipulated the transfer of moneys. It
  cannot be said that the prosecution had wholly succeeded; for when Brandon,
  the bank manager, was put into the witness box he was compelled to admit that
  not only Frank, but he himself and Jasper Cole, were in a position to reach
  the books.</p>

  <p>The opening speech for the crown had been a masterly one. But that there
  were many weak points in the evidence and in the assumptions which the
  prosecution drew was evident to the merest tyro.</p>

  <p>Sir George Murphy Jackson, the attorney general, who prosecuted, attempted
  to dispose summarily of certain conflictions, and it had to be confessed that
  his explanations were very plausible.</p>

  <p>"The defense will tell us," he said, in that shrill, clarion tone of his
  which has made to quake the hearts of so many hostile witnesses, "that we
  have not accounted for the fourth man who drove up in his car ten minutes
  after Merrill had entered the house, and disappeared, but I am going to tell
  you my theory of that incident.</p>

  <p>"Merrill had an accomplice who is not in custody, and that accomplice is
  Rex Holland. Merrill had planned and prepared this murder, because from some
  statement which his uncle had made he believed that not only was his whole
  future dependent upon destroying his benefactor and silencing forever the one
  man who knew the extent of his villainy, but he had in his cold, shrewd way
  accurately foreseen the exact consequence of such a shooting. It was a big
  criminal's big idea.</p>

  <p>"He foresaw this trial," he said impressively; "he foresaw, gentlemen of
  the jury, his acquittal at your hands. He foresaw a reaction which would not
  only give him the woman he professes to love, but in consequence place in his
  hands the disposal of her considerable fortune.</p>

  <p>"Why should he shoot John Minute? you may ask; and I reply to that
  question with another: What would have happened had he not shot his uncle? He
  would have been a ruined man. The doors of his uncle's house would have been
  closed to him. The legacy would have been revoked, the marriage for which he
  had planned so long would have been an unrealized dream.</p>

  <p>"He knew the extent of the fortune which was coming to Miss Nuttall. Mr.
  Minute made two wills, in both of which he left an identical sum to his ward.
  The first of these, revoked by the second and containing the same provision,
  was witnessed by the man in the dock! He knew, too, that the Rhodesian gold
  mine, the shares of which were held by John Minute on the girl's behalf, was
  likely to prove a very rich proposition, and I suggest that the information
  coming to him as Mr. Minute's secretary, he deliberately suppressed that
  information for his own purpose.</p>

  <p>"What had he to gain? I ask you to believe that if he is acquitted he will
  have achieved all that he ever hoped to achieve."</p>

  <p>There was a little murmur in the court. Frank Merrill, leaning on the
  ledge of the dock, looked down at the girl in the body of the court, and
  their eyes met. He saw the indignation in her face and nodded with a little
  smile, then turned again to the counsel with that eager, half- quizzical look
  of interest which the girl had so often seen upon his handsome face.</p>

  <p>"Much will be made, in the course of this trial, of the presence of
  another man, and the defense will endeavor to secure capital out of the fact
  that the man Crawley, who it was suggested was in the house for an improper
  purpose, has not been discovered. As to the fourth man, the driver of the
  motor car, there seems little doubt but that he was an accomplice of Merrill.
  This mysterious Rex Holland, who has been identified by Mrs. Totney, of
  Uckfield, spent the whole of the day wandering about Sussex, obviously having
  one plan in his mind, which was to arrive at Mr. Minute's house at the same
  time as his confederate.</p>

  <p>"You will have the taxi-driver's evidence that when Merrill stepped down,
  after being driven from the station, he looked left and right, as though he
  were expecting somebody. The plan to some extent miscarried. The accomplice
  arrived ten minutes too late. On some pretext or other Merrill probably left
  the room. I suggest that he did not go into the dining room, but that he went
  out into the garden and was met by his accomplice, who handed him the weapon
  with which this crime was committed.</p>

  <p>"It may be asked by the defense why the accomplice, who was presumably Rex
  Holland, did not himself commit the crime. I could offer two or three
  alternative suggestions, all of which are feasible. The deceased man was shot
  at close quarters, and was found in such an attitude as to suggest that he
  was wholly unprepared for the attack. We know that he was in some fear and
  that he invariably went armed; yet it is fairly certain that he made no
  attempt to draw his weapon, which he certainly would have done had he been
  suddenly confronted by an armed stranger.</p>

  <p>"I do not pretend that I am explaining the strange relationship between
  Merrill and this mysterious forger. Merrill is the only man who has seen him
  and has given a vague and somewhat confused description of him. 'He was a man
  with a short, close-clipped beard' is Merrill's description. The woman who
  served him with tea near Uckfield describes him as a 'youngish man with a
  dark mustache, but otherwise clean shaven.'</p>

  <p>"There is no reason, of course, why he should not have removed his beard,
  but as against that suggestion we will call evidence to prove that the man
  seen driving with the murdered chauffeur was invariably a man with a mustache
  and no beard, so that the balance of probability is on the side of the
  supposition that Merrill is not telling the truth. An unknown client with a
  large deposit at his bank would not be likely constantly to alter his
  appearance. If he were a criminal, as we know him to be, there would be
  another reason why he should not excite suspicion in this way."</p>

  <p>His address covered the greater part of a day&mdash;but he returned to the
  scene in the garden, to the supposed meeting of the two men, and to the
  murder.</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann, sitting with Frank's solicitor, scratched his nose and
  grinned.</p>

  <p>"I have never heard a more ingenious piece of reconstruction," he said;
  "though, of course, the whole thing is palpably absurd."</p>

  <p>As a theory it was no doubt excellent; but men are not sentenced to death
  on theories, however ingenious they may be. Probably nobody in the court so
  completely admired the ingenuity as the man most affected. At the lunch
  interval on the day on which this theory was put forward he met his solicitor
  and Saul Arthur Mann in the bare room in which such interviews are
  permitted.</p>

  <p>"It was really fascinating to hear him," said Frank, as he sipped the cup
  of tea which they had brought him. "I almost began to believe that I had
  committed the murder! But isn't it rather alarming? Will the jury take the
  same view?" he asked, a little troubled.</p>

  <p>The solicitor shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Unsupported theories of that sort do not go well with juries, and, of
  course, the whole story is so flimsy and so improbable that it will go for no
  more than a piece of clever reasoning."</p>

  <p>"Did anybody see you at the railway station?"</p>

  <p>Frank shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I suppose hundreds of people saw me, but would hardly remember me."</p>

  <p>"Was there any one on the train who knew you?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Frank, after a moment's thought. "There were six people in my
  carriage until we got to Lewes, but I think I told you that, and you have not
  succeeded in tracing any of them."</p>

  <p>"It is most difficult to get into touch with those people," said the
  lawyer. "Think of the scores of people one travels with, without ever
  remembering what they looked like or how they were dressed. If you had been a
  woman, traveling with women, every one of your five fellow passengers would
  have remembered you and would have recalled your hat."</p>

  <p>Frank laughed.</p>

  <p>"There are certain disadvantages in being a man," he said. "How do you
  think the case is going?"</p>

  <p>"They have offered no evidence yet. I think you will agree, Mr. Mann," he
  said respectfully, for Saul Arthur Mann was a power in legal circles.</p>

  <p>"None at all," the little fellow agreed.</p>

  <p>Frank recalled the first day he had seen him, with his hat perched on the
  back of his head and his shabby, genteel exterior.</p>

  <p>"Oh, by Jove!" he said. "I suppose they will be trying to fasten the death
  of that man upon me that we saw in Gray Square."</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann nodded.</p>

  <p>"They have not put that in the indictment," he said, "nor the case of the
  chauffeur. You see, your conviction will rest entirely upon this present
  charge, and both the other matters are subsidiary."</p>

  <p>Frank walked thoughtfully up and down the room, his hands behind his
  back.</p>

  <p>"I wonder who Rex Holland is," he said, half to himself.</p>

  <p>"You still have your theory?" asked the lawyer, eying him keenly.</p>

  <p>Frank nodded.</p>

  <p>"And you still would rather not put it into words?"</p>

  <p>"Much rather not," said Frank gravely.</p>

  <p>He returned to the court and glanced round for the girl, but she was not
  there. The rest of the afternoon's proceedings, taken up as they were with
  the preliminaries of the case, bored him.</p>

  <p>It was on the twelfth day of the trial that Jasper Cole stepped on to the
  witness stand. He was dressed in black and was paler than usual, but he took
  the oath in a firm voice and answered the questions which were put to him
  without hesitation.</p>

  <p>The story of Frank's quarrel with his uncle, of the forged checks, and of
  his own experience on the night of the crime filled the greater part of the
  forenoon, and it was in the afternoon when Bryan Bennett, one of the most
  brilliant barristers of his time, stood up to cross- examine.</p>

  <p>"Had you any suspicion that your employer was being robbed?"</p>

  <p>"I had a suspicion," replied Jasper.</p>

  <p>"Did you communicate your suspicion to your employer?"</p>

  <p>Jasper hesitated.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied at last.</p>

  <p>"Why do you hesitate?" asked Bennett sharply.</p>

  <p>"Because, although I did not directly communicate my suspicions, I hinted
  to Mr. Minute that he should have an independent audit."</p>

  <p>"So you thought the books were wrong?"</p>

  <p>"I did."</p>

  <p>"In these circumstances," asked Bennett slowly, "do you not think it was
  very unwise of you to touch those books yourself?"</p>

  <p>"When did I touch them?" asked Jasper quickly.</p>

  <p>"I suggest that on a certain night you came to the bank and remained in
  the bank by yourself, examining the ledgers on behalf of your employer, and
  that during that time you handled at least three books in which these
  falsifications were made."</p>

  <p>"That is quite correct," said Jasper, after a moment's thought; "but my
  suspicions were general and did not apply to any particular group of
  books."</p>

  <p>"But did you not think it was dangerous?"</p>

  <p>Again the hesitation.</p>

  <p>"It may have been foolish, and if I had known how matters were developing
  I should certainly not have touched them."</p>

  <p>"You do admit that there were several periods of time from seven in the
  evening until nine and from nine-thirty until eleven-fifteen when you were
  absolutely alone in the bank?"</p>

  <p>"That is true," said Jasper.</p>

  <p>"And during those periods you could, had you wished and had you been a
  forger, for example, or had you any reason for falsifying the entries, have
  made those falsifications?"</p>

  <p>"I admit there was time," said Jasper.</p>

  <p>"Would you describe yourself as a friend of Frank Merrill's?"</p>

  <p>"Not a close friend," replied Jasper.</p>

  <p>"Did you like him?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot say that I was fond of him," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"He was a rival of yours?"</p>

  <p>"In what respect?"</p>

  <p>Counsel shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"He was very fond of Miss Nuttall."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And she was fond of him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Did you not aspire to pay your addresses to Miss Nuttall?"</p>

  <p>Jasper Cole looked down to the girl, and May averted her eyes. Her cheeks
  were burning and she had a wild desire to flee from the court.</p>

  <p>"If you mean did I love Miss Nuttall," said Jasper Cole, in his quiet,
  even tone, "I reply that I did."</p>

  <p>"You even secured the active support of Mr. Minute?"</p>

  <p>"I never urged the matter with Mr. Minute," said Jasper.</p>

  <p>"So that if he moved on your behalf he did so without your knowledge?"</p>

  <p>"Without my pre-knowledge," corrected the witness. "He told me afterward
  that he had spoken to Miss Nuttall, and I was considerably embarrassed."</p>

  <p>"I understand you were a man of curious habits, Mr. Cole."</p>

  <p>"We are all people of curious habits," smiled the witness.</p>

  <p>"But you in particular. You were an Orientalist, I believe?"</p>

  <p>"I have studied Oriental languages and customs," said Jasper shortly.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever extended your study to the realm of hypnotism?"</p>

  <p>"I have," replied the witness.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever made experiments?"</p>

  <p>"On animals, yes."</p>

  <p>"On human beings?"</p>

  <p>"No, I have never made experiments on human beings."</p>

  <p>"Have you also made a study of narcotics?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer leaned forward over the table and looked at the witness between
  half-closed eyes.</p>

  <p>"I have made experiments with narcotic herbs and plants," said Jasper,
  after a moment's hesitation. "I think you should know that the career which
  was planned for me was that of a doctor, and I have always been very
  interested in the effects of narcotics."</p>

  <p>"You know of a drug called <i>cannabis indica</i>?" asked the counsel,
  consulting his paper.</p>

  <p>"Yes; it is 'Indian hemp.'"</p>

  <p>"Is there an infusion of <i>cannabis indica</i> to be obtained?"</p>

  <p>"I do not think there is," said the other. "I can probably enlighten you
  because I see now the trend of your examination. I once told Frank Merrill,
  many years ago, when I was very enthusiastic, that an infusion of <i>cannabis
  indica</i>, combined with tincture of opium and hyocine, produced certain
  effects."</p>

  <p>"It is inclined to sap the will power of a man or a woman who is
  constantly absorbing this poison in small doses?" suggested the counsel.</p>

  <p>"That is so."</p>

  <p>The counsel now switched off on a new tack.</p>

  <p>"Do you know the East of London?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, slightly."</p>

  <p>"Do you know Silvers Rents?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Do you ever go to Silvers Rents?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I go there very regularly."</p>

  <p>The readiness of the reply astonished both Frank and the girl. She had
  been feeling more and more uncomfortable as the cross-examination continued,
  and had a feeling that she had in some way betrayed Jasper Cole's confidence.
  She had listened to the cross-examination which revealed Jasper as a
  scientist with something approaching amazement. She had known of the
  laboratory, but had associated the place with those entertaining experiments
  that an idle dabbler in chemistry might undertake.</p>

  <p>For a moment she doubted, and searched her mind for some occasion when he
  had practiced his medical knowledge. Dimly she realized that there
  <i>had</i>been some such occasion, and then she remembered that it had always
  been Jasper Cole who had concocted the strange drafts which had so relieved
  the headache to which, when she was a little younger, she had been something
  of a martyr. Could he&mdash;She struggled hard to dismiss the thought as
  being unworthy of her; and now, when the object of his visits to Silvers
  Rents was under examination, she found her curiosity growing.</p>

  <p>"Why did you go to Silvers Rents?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer.</p>

  <p>"I will repeat my question: With what object did you go to Silvers
  Rents?"</p>

  <p>"I decline to answer that question," said the man in the box coolly. "I
  merely tell you that I went there frequently."</p>

  <p>"And you refuse to say why?"</p>

  <p>"I refuse to say why," repeated the witness.</p>

  <p>The judge on the bench made a little note.</p>

  <p>"I put it to you," said counsel, speaking impressively, "that it was in
  Silvers Rents that you took on another identity."</p>

  <p>"That is probably true," said the other, and the girl gasped; he was so
  cool, so self-possessed, so sure of himself.</p>

  <p>"I suggest to you," the counsel went on, "that in those Rents Jasper Cole
  became Rex Holland."</p>

  <p>There was a buzz of excitement, a sudden soft clamor of voices through
  which the usher's harsh demand for silence cut like a knife.</p>

  <p>"Your suggestion is an absurd one," said Jasper, without heat, "and I
  presume that you are going to produce evidence to support so infamous a
  statement."</p>

  <p>"What evidence I produce," said counsel, with asperity, "is a matter for
  me to decide."</p>

  <p>"It is also a matter for the witness," interposed the soft voice of the
  judge. "As you have suggested that Holland was a party to the murder, and as
  you are inferring that Rex Holland is Jasper Cole, it is presumed that you
  will call evidence to support so serious a charge."</p>

  <p>"I am not prepared to call evidence, my lord, and if your lordship thinks
  the question should not have been put I am willing to withdraw it."</p>

  <p>The judge nodded and turned his head to the jury.</p>

  <p>"You will consider that question as not having been put, gentlemen," he
  said. "Doubtless counsel is trying to establish the fact that one person
  might just as easily have been Rex Holland as another. There is no suggestion
  that Mr. Cole went to Silvers Rents&mdash;which I understand is in a very
  poor neighborhood&mdash;with any illegal intent, or that he was committing
  any crime or behaving in any way improperly by paying such frequent visits.
  There may be something in the witness's life associated with that poor house
  which has no bearing on the case and which he does not desire should be
  ventilated in this court. It happens to many of us," the judge went on, "that
  we have associations which it would embarrass us to reveal."</p>

  <p>This little incident closed that portion of the cross-examination, and
  counsel went on to the night of the murder.</p>

  <p>"When did you come to the house?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I came to the house soon after dark."</p>

  <p>"Had you been in London?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I walked from Bexhill."</p>

  <p>"It was dark when you arrived?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, nearly dark."</p>

  <p>"The servants had all gone out?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Was Mr. Minute pleased to see you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; he had expected me earlier in the day."</p>

  <p>"Did he tell you that his nephew was coming to see him?"</p>

  <p>"I knew that."</p>

  <p>"You say he suggested that you should make yourself scarce?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And as you had a headache, you went upstairs and lay down on your
  bed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"What were you doing in Bexhill?"</p>

  <p>"I came down from town and got into the wrong portion of the train."</p>

  <p>A junior leaned over and whispered quickly to his leader.</p>

  <p>"I see, I see," said the counsel petulantly. "Your ticket was found at
  Bexhill. Have you ever seen Mr. Rex Holland?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>"You have never met any person of that name?"</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>In this tame way the cross-examination closed, as cross-examinations have
  a habit of doing.</p>

  <p>By the time the final addresses of counsel had ended, and the judge had
  finished a masterly summing-up, there was no doubt whatever in the mind of
  any person in the court as to what the verdict would be. The jury was absent
  from the box for twenty minutes and returned a verdict of "Not guilty!"</p>

  <p>The judge discharged Frank Merrill without comment, and he left the court
  a free but ruined man.</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13">XIII. THE MAN WHO CAME TO MONTREUX</a></h2>

  <p>It was two months after the great trial, on a warm day in October, when
  Frank Merrill stepped ashore from the big white paddle boat which had carried
  him across Lake Leman from Lausanne, and, handing his bag to a porter, made
  his way to the hotel omnibus. He looked at his watch. It pointed to a quarter
  to four, and May was not due to arrive until half past. He went to his hotel,
  washed and changed and came down to the vestibule to inquire if the
  instructions he had telegraphed had been carried out.</p>

  <p>May was arriving in company with Saul Arthur Mann, who was taking one of
  his rare holidays abroad. Frank had only seen the girl once since the day of
  the trial. He had come to breakfast on the following morning, and very little
  had been said. He was due to leave that afternoon for the Continent. He had a
  little money, sufficient for his needs, and Jasper Cole had offered no
  suggestion that he would dispute the will, in so far as it affected Frank. So
  he had gone abroad and had idled away two months in France, Spain, and Italy,
  and had then made his leisurely way back to Switzerland by way of
  Maggiore.</p>

  <p>He had grown a little graver, was a little more set in his movements, but
  he bore upon his face no mark to indicate the mental agony through which he
  must have passed in that long-drawn-out and wearisome trial. So thought the
  girl as she came through the swing doors of the hotel, passed the obsequious
  hotel servants, and greeted him in the big palm court.</p>

  <p>If she saw any change in him he remarked a development in her which was a
  little short of wonderful. She was at that age when the woman is breaking
  through the beautiful chrysalis of girlhood. In those two months a remarkable
  change had come over her, a change which he could not for the moment define,
  for this phenomenon of development had been denied to his experience.</p>

  <p>"Why, May," he said, "you are quite old."</p>

  <p>She laughed, and again he noticed the change. The laugh was richer,
  sweeter, purer than the bubbling treble he had known.</p>

  <p>"You are not getting complimentary, are you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>She was exquisitely dressed, and had that poise which few Englishwomen
  achieve. She had the art of wearing clothes, and from the flimsy crest of her
  toque to the tips of her little feet she was all that the most exacting
  critic could desire. There are well-dressed women who are no more than
  mannequins. There are fine ladies who cannot be mistaken for anything but
  fine ladies, whose dresses are a horror and an abomination and whose
  expressed tastes are execrable.</p>

  <p>May Nuttall was a fine lady, finely appareled.</p>

  <p>"When you have finished admiring me, Frank," she said, "tell us what you
  have been doing. But first of all let us have some tea. You know Mr.
  Mann?"</p>

  <p>The little investigator beaming in the background took Frank's hand and
  shook it heartily. He was dressed in what he thought was an appropriate
  costume for a mountainous country. His boots were stout, the woolen stockings
  which covered his very thin legs were very woolen, and his knickerbocker suit
  was warranted to stand wear and tear. He had abandoned his top hat for a
  large golf cap, which was perched rakishly over one eye. Frank looked round
  apprehensively for Saul Arthur's alpenstock, and was relieved when he failed
  to discover one.</p>

  <p>The girl threw off her fur wrap and unbuttoned her gloves as the waiter
  placed the big silver tray on the table before her.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I have not much to tell," said Frank in answer to her
  question. "I've just been loafing around. What is your news?"</p>

  <p>"What is my news?" she asked. "I don't think I have any, except that
  everything is going very smoothly in England, and, oh, Frank, I am so
  immensely rich!"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"The appropriate thing would be to say that I am immensely poor," he said,
  "but as a matter of fact I am not. I went down to Aix and won quite a lot of
  money."</p>

  <p>"Won it?" she said.</p>

  <p>He nodded with an amused little smile.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't have thought I was a gambler, would you?" he asked solemnly.
  "I don't think I am, as a matter of fact, but somehow I wanted to occupy my
  mind."</p>

  <p>"I understand," she said quickly.</p>

  <p>Another little pause while she poured out the tea, which afforded Saul
  Arthur Mann an opportunity of firing off fifty facts about Geneva in as many
  sentences.</p>

  <p>"What has happened to Jasper?" asked Frank after a while.</p>

  <p>The girl flushed a little.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jasper," she said awkwardly, "I see him, you know. He has become more
  mysterious than ever, quite like one of those wicked people one reads about
  in sensational stories. He has a laboratory somewhere in the country, and he
  does quite a lot of motoring. I've seen him several times at Brighton, for
  instance."</p>

  <p>Frank nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"I should think that he was a good driver," he said.</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann looked up and met his eye with a smile which was lost
  upon the girl.</p>

  <p>"He has been kind to me," she said hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>"Does he ever speak about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to think about that," she said; "please don't let us talk
  about it."</p>

  <p>He knew she was referring to John Minute's death, and changed the
  conversation.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later he had an opportunity of speaking with Mr. Mann.</p>

  <p>"What is the news?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann looked round.</p>

  <p>"I think we are getting near the truth," he said, dropping his voice. "One
  of my men has had him under observation ever since the day of the trial.
  There is no doubt that he is really a brilliant chemist."</p>

  <p>"Have you a theory?"</p>

  <p>"I have several," said Mr. Mann. "I am perfectly satisfied that the
  unfortunate fellow we saw together on the occasion of our first meeting was
  Rex Holland's servant. I was as certain that he was poisoned by a very
  powerful poisoning. When your trial was on the body was exhumed and examined,
  and the presence of that drug was discovered. It was the same as that
  employed in the case of the chauffeur. Obviously, Rex Holland is a clever
  chemist. I wanted to see you about that. He said at the trial that he had
  discussed such matters with you."</p>

  <p>Frank nodded.</p>

  <p>"We used to have quite long talks about drugs," he said. "I have recalled
  many of those conversations since the day of the trial. He even fired me with
  his enthusiasm, and I used to assist him in his little experiments, and
  obtained quite a working knowledge of these particular elements.
  Unfortunately I cannot remember very much, for my enthusiasm soon died, and
  beyond the fact that he employed hyocine and Indian hemp I have only the
  dimmest recollection of any of the constituents he employed."</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur nodded energetically.</p>

  <p>"I shall have more to tell you later, perhaps," he said, "but at present
  my inquiries are shaping quite nicely. He is going to be a difficult man to
  catch, because, if all I believe is true, he is one of the most cold-blooded
  and calculating men it has ever been my lot to meet &mdash;and I have met a
  few," he added grimly.</p>

  <p>When he said men Frank knew that he had meant criminals.</p>

  <p>"We are probably doing him a horrible injustice," he smiled. "Poor old
  Jasper!"</p>

  <p>"You are not cut out for police work," snapped Saul Arthur Mann; "you've
  too many sympathies."</p>

  <p>"I don't exactly sympathize," rejoined Frank, "but I just pity him in a
  way."</p>

  <p>Again Mr. Mann looked round cautiously and again lowered his voice, which
  had risen.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing I want to talk to you about. It is rather a delicate
  matter, Mr. Merrill," he said.</p>

  <p>"Fire ahead!"</p>

  <p>"It is about Miss Nuttall. She has seen a lot of our friend Jasper, and
  after every interview she seems to grow more and more reliant upon his help.
  Once or twice she has been embarrassed when I have spoken about Jasper Cole
  and has changed the subject."</p>

  <p>Frank pursed his lips thoughtfully, and a hard little look came into his
  eyes, which did not promise well for Jasper.</p>

  <p>"So that is it," he said, and shrugged his shoulders. "If she cares for
  him, it is not my business."</p>

  <p>"But it is your business," said the other sharply. "She was fond enough of
  you to offer to marry you."</p>

  <p>Further talk was cut short by the arrival of the girl. Their meeting at
  Geneva had been to some extent a chance one. She was going through to
  Chamonix to spend the winter, and Saul Arthur Mann seized the opportunity of
  taking a short and pleasant holiday. Hearing that Frank was in Switzerland,
  she had telegraphed him to meet her.</p>

  <p>"Are you staying any time in Switzerland?" she asked him as they strolled
  along the beautiful quay.</p>

  <p>"I am going back to London to-night," he replied.</p>

  <p>"To-night," she said in surprise.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"But I am staying here for two or three days," she protested.</p>

  <p>"I intended also staying for two or three days," he smiled, "but my
  business will not wait."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, she persuaded him to stay till the morrow.</p>

  <p>They were at breakfast when the morning mail was delivered, and Frank
  noted that she went rapidly through the dozen letters which came to her, and
  she chose one for first reading. He could not help but see that that bore an
  English stamp, and his long acquaintance with the curious calligraphy of
  Jasper Cole left him in no doubt as to who was the correspondent. He saw with
  what eagerness she read the letter, the little look of disappointment when
  she turned to an inside sheet and found that it had not been filled, and his
  mind was made up. He had a post also, which he examined with some evidence of
  impatience.</p>

  <p>"Your mail is not so nice as mine," said the girl with a smile.</p>

  <p>"It is not nice at all," he grumbled; "the one thing I wanted, and, to be
  very truthful, May, the one inducement&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To stay over the night," she added, "was&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>"I have been trying to buy a house on the lake," he said, "and the
  infernal agent at Lausanne promised to write telling me whether my terms had
  been agreed to by his client."</p>

  <p>He looked down at the table and frowned. Saul Arthur Mann had a great and
  extensive knowledge of human nature. He had remarked the disappointment on
  Frank's face, having identified also the correspondent whose letter claimed
  priority of attention. He knew that Frank's anger with the house agent was
  very likely the expression of his anger in quite another direction.</p>

  <p>"Can I send the letter on?" suggested the girl.</p>

  <p>"That won't help me," said Frank, with a little grimace. "I wanted to
  settle the business this week."</p>

  <p>"I have it," she said. "I will open the letter and telegraph to you in
  Paris whether the terms are accepted or not."</p>

  <p>Frank laughed.</p>

  <p>"It hardly seems worth that," he said, "but I should take it as awfully
  kind of you if you would, May."</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann believed in his mind that Frank did not care tuppence
  whether the agent accepted the terms or not, but that he had taken this as a
  Heaven-sent opportunity for veiling his annoyance.</p>

  <p>"You have had quite a large mail, Miss Nuttall," he said.</p>

  <p>"I've only opened one, though. It is from Jasper," she said hurriedly.</p>

  <p>Again both men noticed the faint flush, the strange, unusual light which
  came to her eyes.</p>

  <p>"And where does Jasper write from?" asked Frank, steadying his voice.</p>

  <p>"He writes from England, but he was going on the Continent to Holland the
  day he wrote," she said. "It is funny to think that he is here."</p>

  <p>"In Switzerland?" asked Frank in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly," she laughed. "No, I mean on the mainland&mdash;I mean
  there is no sea between us."</p>

  <p>She went crimson.</p>

  <p>"It sounds thrilling," said Frank dryly.</p>

  <p>She flashed round at him.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't be horrid about Jasper," she said quickly; "he never speaks
  about you unkindly."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why he should," said Frank; "but let's get off a subject
  which is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which is&mdash;what?" she challenged</p>

  <p>"Which is controversial," said Frank diplomatically.</p>

  <p>She came down to the station to see him off. As he looked out of the
  window, waving his farewells, he thought he had never seen a more lovely
  being or one more desirable.</p>

  <p>It was in the afternoon of that day which saw Frank Merrill speeding
  toward the Swiss frontier and Paris that Mr. Rex Holland strode into the
  Palace Hotel at Montreux and seated himself at a table in the restaurant. The
  hour was late and the room was almost deserted. Giovanni, the head waiter,
  recognized him and came hurriedly across the room.</p>

  <p>"Ah, m'sieur," he said, "you are back from England. I didn't expect you
  till the winter sports had started. Is Paris very dull?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't come through Paris," said the other shortly; "there are many
  roads leading to Switzerland."</p>

  <p>"But few pleasant roads, m'sieur. I have come to Montreux by all manner of
  ways&mdash;from Paris, through Pontarlier, through Ostend, Brussels, through
  the Hook of Holland and Amsterdam, but Paris is the only way for the man who
  is flying to this beautiful land."</p>

  <p>The man at the table said nothing, scanning the menu carefully. He looked
  tired as one who had taken a very long journey.</p>

  <p>"It may interest you to know," he said, after he had given his order and
  as Giovanni was turning away, "that I came by the longest route. Tell me,
  Giovanni, have you a man called Merrill staying at the hotel?"</p>

  <p>"No, m'sieur," said the other. "Is he a friend of yours?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Rex Holland smiled.</p>

  <p>"In a sense he is a friend, in a sense he is not," he said flippantly, and
  offered no further enlightenment, although Giovanni waited with a deferential
  cock of his head.</p>

  <p>Later, when he had finished his modest dinner, he strolled into the one
  long street of the town, returning to the writing room of the hotel with a
  number of papers which included the visitors' list, a publication printed in
  English, and which, as it related the comings and goings of visitors, not
  only to Lausanne, Montreux, and Teritet, but also to Evian and Geneva,
  enjoyed a fair circulation. He sat at the table, and, drawing a sheet of
  paper from the rack, wrote, addressed an envelope to Frank Merrill, esquire,
  Hotel de France, Geneva, slipped it into the hotel pillar box, and went to
  bed.</p>

  <p>"There's a letter here for Frank," said the girl. "I wonder if it is from
  his agent."</p>

  <p>She examined the envelope, which bore the Montreux postmark.</p>

  <p>"I should imagine it is," said Saul Arthur Mann.</p>

  <p>"Well, I am going to open it, anyway," said the girl. "Poor Frank! He will
  be in a state of suspense."</p>

  <p>She tore open the envelope, and took out a letter. Mr. Mann saw her face
  go white, and the letter trembled in her hand. Without a word she passed it
  to him, and he read:</p>

  <p>"Dear Frank Merrill," said the letter. "Give me another month's grace and
  then you may tell the whole story. Yours, Rex Holland."</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann stared at the letter with open mouth.</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?" asked the girl in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"It means that Merrill is shielding somebody," said the other. "It
  means&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly his face lit up with excitement.</p>

  <p>"The writing!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>Her eyes followed his, and for a moment she did not understand; then, with
  a lightning sweep of her arm, she snatched the letter from his hand and
  crumpled it in a ball.</p>

  <p>"The writing!" said Mr. Mann again. "I've seen it before. It is
  &mdash;Jasper Cole's!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadily, though her face was white, and the hand which
  grasped the crumpled paper was shaking.</p>

  <p>"I think you are mistaken, Mr. Mann," she said quietly.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap14"
     id="chap14">XIV. THE MAN WHO LOOKED LIKE FRANK</a></h2>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann came back to England full of his news, and found Frank at
  the little Jermyn Street hotel where he had installed himself, and Frank
  listened without interruption to the story of the letter.</p>

  <p>"Of course," the little fellow went on, "I went straight over to Montreux.
  The note heading was not on the paper, but I had no difficulty, by comparing
  the qualities of papers used at the various hotels, in discovering that it
  was written from the Palace. The head waiter knew this Rex Holland, who had
  been a frequent visitor, had always tipped very liberally, and lived in
  something like style. He could not describe his patron, except that he was a
  young man with a very languid manner who had arrived the previous morning
  from Holland and had immediately inquired for Frank Merrill."</p>

  <p>"From Holland! Are you sure it was the morning? I have a particular reason
  for asking," asked Frank quickly.</p>

  <p>"No, it was not in the morning, now you mention it. It was in the evening.
  He left again the following morning by the northern train."</p>

  <p>"How did he find my address?" asked Frank.</p>

  <p>"Obviously from the visitors' list. The waiter on duty in the writing room
  remembered having seen him consulting the newspaper. Now, my boy, you have to
  be perfectly candid with me. What do you know about Rex Holland?"</p>

  <p>Frank opened his case, took out a cigarette, and lit it before he
  replied.</p>

  <p>"I know what everybody knows about him," he said, with a hint of
  bitterness in his voice, "and something which nobody knows but me."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear fellow," said Saul Arthur Mann, laying his hand on the
  other's shoulder, "surely you realize how important it is for you that you
  should tell me all you know."</p>

  <p>Frank shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The time is not come," he said, and he would make no further
  statement.</p>

  <p>But on another matter he was emphatic.</p>

  <p>"By heaven, Mann, I am not going to stand by and see May ruin her life.
  There's something sinister in this influence which Jasper is exercising over
  her. You have seen it for yourself."</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur nodded.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand what it is," he confessed. "Of course Jasper is not a
  bad-looking fellow. He has perfect manners and is a charming companion. You
  don't think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That he is winning on his merits?" Frank shook his head. "No, indeed, I
  do not. It is difficult for me to discuss my private affairs, and you know
  how reluctant I am to do so, but you are also aware of what I think of May. I
  was hoping that we should go back to the place where we left off, and,
  although she is kindness itself, this girl who is more to me than anything or
  anybody in the world, and who was prepared to marry me, and would have
  married me but for Jasper's machinations, was almost cold."</p>

  <p>He was walking up and down the room, and now halted in his stride and
  spread out his arms despairingly.</p>

  <p>"What am I to do? I cannot lose her. I cannot!"</p>

  <p>There was a fierceness in his tone which revealed the depth of his
  feeling, and Saul Arthur Mann understood.</p>

  <p>"I think it is too soon to say you have lost her, Frank," he said.</p>

  <p>He had conceived a genuine liking for Frank Merrill, and the period of
  tribulation through which the young man had passed had heightened the respect
  in which he held him.</p>

  <p>"We shall see light in dark places before we go much farther," he said.
  "There is something behind this crime, Frank, which I don't understand, but
  which I am certain is no mystery to you. I am sure that you are shielding
  somebody, for what reason I am not in a position to tell, but I will get to
  the bottom of it."</p>

  <p>No event in the interesting life of this little man, who had spent his
  years in the accumulation of facts, had so distressed and piqued him as the
  murder of John Minute. The case had ended where the trial had left it.</p>

  <p>Crawley, who might have offered a new aspect to the tragedy, had
  disappeared as completely as though the earth had swallowed him. The most
  strenuous efforts which the official police had made, added to the
  investigations which Saul Arthur Mann had conducted independently, had failed
  to trace the fugitive ex-sergeant of police. Obviously, he was not to be
  confounded with Rex Holland. He was a distinct personality working possibly
  in collusion, but there the association ended.</p>

  <p>It had occurred to the investigator that possibly Crawley had accompanied
  Rex Holland in his flight, but the most careful inquiries which he had
  pursued at Montreux were fruitless in this respect as in all others.</p>

  <p>To add to his bewilderment, investigations nearer at home were constantly
  bringing him across the track of Frank Merrill. It was as though fate had
  conspired to show the boy in the blackest light. Frank had been acting as
  secretary to his uncle, and then Jasper Cole had suddenly appeared upon the
  scene from nowhere in particular. The suggestion had been made somewhat
  vaguely that he had come from "abroad," and it was certain that he arrived as
  a result of long negotiations which John Minute himself had conducted. They
  were negotiations which involved months of correspondence, no letter of which
  either from one or the other had Frank seen.</p>

  <p>While the trial was pending, the little man collected quite a volume of
  information, both from Frank and the girl, but nothing had been quite as
  inexplicable as this intrusion of Jasper Cole upon the scene, or the
  extraordinary mystery which John Minute had made of his engagement.</p>

  <p>He had written and posted all the letters to Jasper himself, and had
  apparently received the replies, which he had burned, at some other address
  of which Frank was ignorant.</p>

  <p>Jasper had come, and then one day there had been a quarrel, not between
  the two young men, but between Frank and his uncle. It was a singularly
  bitter quarrel, and again Frank refused to discuss the cause. He left the
  impression upon Saul Arthur's mind that he had to some extent been
  responsible. And here was another fact which puzzled "The Man Who Knew."
  Sergeant Smith, as he was then, had been to some extent responsible. It was
  Frank who had introduced the sergeant to Eastbourne and brought him to his
  uncle. But this was only one aspect of the mystery. There were others as
  obscure.</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann went back to his bureau, and for the twentieth time
  gathered the considerable dossiers he had accumulated relating to the case
  and to the characters, and went through them systematically and
  carefully.</p>

  <p>He left his office near midnight, but at nine o'clock the next morning was
  on his way to Eastbourne. Constable Wiseman was, by good fortune, enjoying a
  day's holiday, and was at work in his kitchen garden when Mr. Mann's car
  pulled up before the cottage. Wiseman received his visitor importantly, for,
  though the constable's prestige was regarded in official circles as having
  diminished as a result of the trial, it was felt by the villagers that their
  policeman, if he had not solved the mystery of John Minute's death, had at
  least gone a long way to its solution.</p>

  <p>In the spotless room which was half kitchen and half sitting room, with
  its red-tiled floor covered by bright matting, Mrs. Wiseman produced a
  well-dusted Windsor chair, which she placed at Saul Arthur Mann's disposal
  before she politely vanished. In a very few words the investigator stated his
  errand, and Constable Wiseman listened in noncommittal silence. When his
  visitor had finished, he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The only thing about the sergeant I know," he said, "I have already told
  the chief constable who sat in that very chair," he explained. "He was always
  a bit of a mystery&mdash;the sergeant, I mean. When he was 'tanked,' if I may
  use the expression, he would tell you stories by the hour, but when he was
  sober you couldn't get a word out of him. His daughter only lived with him
  for about a fortnight."</p>

  <p>"His daughter!" said Mr. Mann quickly.</p>

  <p>"He had a daughter, as I've already notified my superiors," said Constable
  Wiseman gravely. "Rather a pretty girl. I never saw much of her, but she was
  in Eastbourne off and on for about a fortnight after the sergeant came. Funny
  thing, I happen to know the day he arrived, because the wheel of his fly came
  off on my beat, and I noticed the circumstances according to law and reported
  the same. I don't even know if she was living with him. He had a cottage down
  at Birlham Gap, and that is where I saw her. Yes, she was a pretty girl," he
  said reminiscently; "one of the slim and slender kind, very dark and with a
  complexion like milk. But they never found her," he said.</p>

  <p>Again Mr. Mann interrupted.</p>

  <p>"You mean the police?"</p>

  <p>Constable Wiseman shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," he said; "they've been looking for her for years; long before
  Mr. Minute was killed."</p>

  <p>"Who are 'they'?"</p>

  <p>"Well, several people," said the constable slowly. "I happen to know that
  Mr. Cole wanted to find out where she was. But then he didn't start searching
  until weeks after she disappeared. It is very rum," mused Constable Wiseman,
  "the way Mr. Cole went about it. He didn't come straight to us and ask our
  assistance, but he had a lot of private detectives nosing round Eastbourne;
  one of 'em happened to be a cousin of my wife's. So we got to know about it.
  Cole spent a lot of money trying to trace her, and so did Mr. Minute."</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann saw a faint gleam of daylight.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Minute, too?" he asked. "Was he working with Mr. Cole?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I can find out, they were both working independent of the
  other&mdash;Mr. Cole and Mr. Minute," explained Mr. Wiseman. "It is what I
  call a mystery within a mystery, and it has never been properly cleared up. I
  thought something was coming out about it at the trial, but you know what a
  mess the lawyers made of it."</p>

  <p>It was Constable Wiseman's firm conviction that Frank Merrill had escaped
  through the incompetence of the crown authorities, and there were moments in
  his domestic circle when he was bitter and even insubordinate on the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"You still think Mr. Merrill was guilty?" asked Saul Arthur Mann as he
  took his leave of the other.</p>

  <p>"I am as sure of it as I am that I am standing here," said the constable,
  not without a certain pride in the consistency of his view. "Didn't I go into
  the room? Wasn't he there with the deceased? Wasn't his revolver found?
  Hadn't there been some jiggery-pokery with his books in London?"</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann smiled.</p>

  <p>"There are some of us who think differently, Constable," he said, shaking
  hands with the implacable officer of the law.</p>

  <p>He brought back to London a few new facts to be added to his record of
  Sergeant Crawley, alias Smith, and on these he went painstakingly to
  work.</p>

  <p>As has been already explained, Saul Arthur Mann had a particularly useful
  relationship with Scotland Yard, and fortunately, about that time, he was on
  the most excellent terms with official police headquarters, for he had been
  able to assist them in running to earth one of the most powerful blackmailing
  gangs that had ever operated in Europe. His files had been drawn upon to such
  good purpose that the police had secured convictions against the seventeen
  members of the gang who were in England.</p>

  <p>He sought an interview with the chief commissioner, and that same night,
  accompanied by a small army of detectives, he made a systematic search of
  Silvers Rents. The house into which Jasper Cole had been seen to enter was
  again raided, and again without result. The house was empty save for one
  room, a big room which was simply furnished with a truckle-bed, a table, a
  chair, a lamp, and a strip of carpet. There were four rooms &mdash;two
  upstairs, which were never used, and two on the ground floor.</p>

  <p>At the end of a passage was a kitchen, which also was empty, save for a
  length of bamboo ladder. From the kitchen a bolted door led on to a tiny
  square of yard which was separated by three walls from yards of similar
  dimensions to left and right and to the back of the premises. At the back of
  Silvers Rents was Royston Court, which was another cul-de-sac, running
  parallel with Silvers Rents.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mann returned to the house, and again searched the upstairs rooms,
  looking particularly for a trapdoor, for the bamboo ladder suggested some
  such exit. This time, however, he completely failed. Jasper Cole, he found,
  had made only one visit to the house since John Minute's death.</p>

  <p>It is a curious fact, as showing the localizing of interest, that Silvers
  Rents knew nothing of what had occurred almost at its doors, and, though it
  had at its finger tips all the gossip of the docks and the Thames Iron Works,
  it was profoundly ignorant of what was common property in Royston Court. It
  is even more remarkable that Saul Arthur Mann, with his squadron of
  detectives, should have confined their investigations to Silvers Rents.</p>

  <p>The investigator was baffled and disappointed, but by the oddest of
  chances he was to pick up yet another thread of the Minute mystery, a thread
  which, however, was to lead him into an ever-deeper maze than that which he
  had already and so unsuccessfully attempted to penetrate.</p>

  <p>Three days after his search of Silvers Rents, business took Mr. Mann to
  Camden Town. To be exact, he had gone at the request of the police to
  Holloway Jail to see a prisoner who had turned state's evidence on a matter
  in which the police and Mr. Mann were equally interested. Very foolishly he
  had dismissed his taxi, and when he emerged from the doors there was no
  conveyance in sight. He decided, rather than take the trams which would have
  carried him to King's Cross, to walk, and, since he hated main roads, he had
  taken a short cut, which, as he knew, would lead him into the Hampstead
  Road.</p>

  <p>Thus he found himself in Flowerton Road, a thoroughfare of respectable
  detached houses occupied by the superior industrial type. He was striding
  along, swinging his umbrella and humming, as was his wont, an unmusical
  rendering of a popular tune, when his attention was attracted to a sight
  which took his breath away and brought him to a halt.</p>

  <p>It was half past five, and dull, but his eyesight was excellent, and it
  was impossible for him to make a mistake. The houses of Flowerton Road stand
  back and are separated from the sidewalk by diminutive gardens. The front
  doors are approached by six or seven steps, and it was on the top of one of
  these flights in front of an open door that the scene was enacted which
  brought Mr. Mann to a standstill.</p>

  <p>The characters were a young man and a girl. The girl was extremely pretty
  and very pale. The man was the exact double of Frank Merrill. He was dressed
  in a rough tweed suit, and wore a soft felt hat with a fairly wide brim. But
  it was not the appearance of this remarkable apparition which startled the
  investigator. It was the attitude of the two people. The girl was evidently
  pleading with her companion. Saul Arthur Mann was too far away to hear what
  she said, but he saw the young man shake himself loose from the girl. She
  again grasped his arm and raised her face imploringly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mann gasped, for he saw the young man's hand come up and strike her
  back into the house. Then he caught hold of the door and banged it savagely,
  walked down the stairs, and, turning, hurried away.</p>

  <p>The investigator stood as though he were rooted to the spot, and before he
  could recover himself the fellow had turned the corner of the road and was
  out of sight. Saul Arthur Mann took off his hat and wiped his forehead. All
  his initiative was for the moment paralyzed. He walked slowly up to the gate
  and hesitated. What excuse could he have for calling? If this were Frank,
  assuredly his own views were all wrong, and the mystery was a greater mystery
  still.</p>

  <p>His energies began to reawaken. He took a note of the number of the house,
  and hurried off after the young man. When he turned the corner his quarry had
  vanished. He hurried to the next corner, but without overtaking the object of
  his pursuit. Fortunately, at this moment, he found an empty taxicab and
  hailed it.</p>

  <p>"Grimm's Hotel, Jermyn Street," he directed.</p>

  <p>At least he could satisfy his mind upon one point.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap15"
     id="chap15">XV. A LETTER IN THE GRATE</a></h2>

  <p>Grimm's Hotel is in reality a block of flats, with a restaurant attached.
  The restaurant is little more than a kitchen from whence meals are served to
  residents in their rooms. Frank's suite was on the third floor, and Mr. Mann,
  paying his cabman, hurried into the hall, stepped into the automatic lift,
  pressed the button, and was deposited at Frank's door. He knocked with a
  sickening sense of apprehension that there would be no answer. To his delight
  and amazement, he heard Frank's firm step in the tiny hall of his flat, and
  the door was opened. Frank was in the act of dressing for dinner.</p>

  <p>"Come in, S. A. M.," he said cheerily, "and tell me all the news."</p>

  <p>He led the way back to his room and resumed the delicate task of tying his
  dress bow.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been here?" asked Mr. Mann.</p>

  <p>Frank looked at him inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"How long have I been here?" he repeated. "I cannot tell you the exact
  time, but I have been here since a short while after lunch."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mann was bewildered and still unconvinced.</p>

  <p>"What clothes did you take off?"</p>

  <p>It was Frank's turn to look amazed and bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Clothes?" he repeated. "What are you driving at, my dear chap?"</p>

  <p>"What suit were you wearing to-day?" persisted Saul Arthur Mann.</p>

  <p>Frank disappeared into his dressing room and came out with a tumbled
  bundle which he dropped on a chair. It was the blue suit which he usually
  affected.</p>

  <p>"Now what is the joke?"</p>

  <p>"It is no joke," said the other. "I could have sworn that I saw you less
  than half an hour ago in Camden Town."</p>

  <p>"I won't pretend that I don't know where Camden Town is," smiled Frank,
  "but I have not visited that interesting locality for many years."</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann was silent. It was obvious to him that whoever was the
  occupant of 69 Flowerton Road, it was not Frank Merrill. Frank listened to
  the narrative with interest.</p>

  <p>"You were probably mistaken; the light played you a trick, I expect," he
  said.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Mann was emphatic.</p>

  <p>"I could have taken an oath in a court that it was you," he said.</p>

  <p>Frank stared out of the window.</p>

  <p>"How very curious!" he mused. "I suppose I cannot very well prosecute a
  man for looking like me&mdash;poor girl!"</p>

  <p>"Of whom are you thinking?" asked the other.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of the unfortunate woman," answered Frank. "What brutes
  there are in the world!"</p>

  <p>"You gave me a terrible fright," admitted his friend.</p>

  <p>Frank's laugh was loud and hearty.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you saw me figuring in a court, charged with common assault,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>"I saw more than that," said the other gravely, "and I see more than that
  now. Suppose you have a double, and suppose that double is working in
  collusion with your enemies."</p>

  <p>Frank shook his head wearily.</p>

  <p>"My dear friend," he said, with a little smile, "I am tired of supposing
  things. Come and dine with me."</p>

  <p>But Mr. Mann had another engagement. Moreover, he wanted to think things
  out.</p>

  <p>Thinking things out was a process which brought little reward in this
  instance, and he went to bed that night a vexed and puzzled man. He always
  had his breakfast in bed at ten o'clock in the morning, for he had reached
  the age of habits and had fixed ten o'clock, since it gave his clerks time to
  bring down his personal mail from the office to his private residence.</p>

  <p>It was a profitable mail, it was an exciting mail, and it contained an
  element of rich promise, for it included a letter from Constable Wiseman:</p>

  <p>DEAR SIR: Re our previous conversation, I have just come across one of the
  photographs of the young lady&mdash;Sergeant Smith's daughter. It was given
  to the private detective who was searching for her. It was given to my wife
  by her cousin, and I send it to you hoping it may be of some use. Yours
  respectfully, PETER JOHN WISEMAN.</p>

  <p>The photograph was wrapped in a piece of tissue paper, and Saul Arthur
  Mann opened it eagerly. He looked at the oblong card and gasped, for the girl
  who was depicted there was the girl he had seen on the steps of 69 Flowerton
  Road.</p>

  <p>A telephone message prepared Frank for the news, and an hour later the two
  men were together in the office of the bureau.</p>

  <p>"I am going along to that house to see the girl," said Saul Arthur Mann.
  "Will you come?"</p>

  <p>"With all the pleasure in life," said Frank. "Curiously enough, I am as
  eager to find her as you. I remember her very well, and one of the quarrels I
  had with my uncle was due to her. She had come up to the house on behalf of
  her father, and I thought uncle treated her rather brutally."</p>

  <p>"Point number one cleared up," thought Saul Arthur Mann.</p>

  <p>"Then she disappeared," Frank went on, "and Jasper came on the scene.
  There was some association between this girl and Jasper, which I have never
  been able to fathom. All I know is that he took a tremendous interest in her
  and tried to find her, and, so far as I remember, he never succeeded."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mann's car was at the door, and in a few minutes they were deposited
  before the prim exterior of Number 69.</p>

  <p>The door was opened by a girl servant, who stared from Saul Arthur Mann to
  his companion.</p>

  <p>"There is a lady living here," said Mr. Mann.</p>

  <p>He produced the photograph.</p>

  <p>"This is the lady?"</p>

  <p>The girl nodded, still staring at Frank.</p>

  <p>"I want to see her."</p>

  <p>"She's gone," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"You are looking at me very intently," said Frank. "Have you ever seen me
  before?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the girl; "you used to come here, or a gentleman very
  much like you. You are Mr. Merrill."</p>

  <p>"That is my name," smiled Frank, "but I do not think I have ever been here
  before."</p>

  <p>"Where has the lady gone?" asked Saul Arthur.</p>

  <p>"She went last night. Took all her boxes and went off in a cab."</p>

  <p>"Is anybody living in the house?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been in service here?"</p>

  <p>"About a week, sir," replied the girl.</p>

  <p>"We are friends of hers," said Saul Arthur shamelessly, "and we have been
  asked to call to see if everything is all right."</p>

  <p>The girl hesitated, but Saul Arthur Mann, with that air of authority which
  he so readily assumed, swept past her and began an inspection of the
  house.</p>

  <p>It was plainly furnished, but the furniture was good.</p>

  <p>"Apparently the spurious Mr. Merrill had plenty of money," said Saul
  Arthur Mann.</p>

  <p>There were no photographs or papers visible until they came to the
  bedroom, where, in the grate, was a torn sheet of paper bearing a few lines
  of fine writing, which Mr. Mann immediately annexed. Before they left, Frank
  again asked the girl:</p>

  <p>"Was the gentleman who lived here really like me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the little slavey.</p>

  <p>"Have a good look at me," said Frank humorously, and the girl stared
  again.</p>

  <p>"Something like you," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"Did he talk like me?"</p>

  <p>"I never heard him talk, sir," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," said Saul Arthur Mann, "was he kind to his wife?"</p>

  <p>A faint grin appeared on the face of the little servant.</p>

  <p>"They was always rowing," she admitted. "A bullying fellow he was, and she
  was frightened of him. Are you the police?" she asked with sudden
  interest.</p>

  <p>Frank shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, we are not the police."</p>

  <p>He gave the girl half a crown, and walked down the steps ahead of his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"It is rather awkward if I have a double who bullies his wife and lives in
  Camden Town," he said as the car hummed back to the city office.</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann was silent during the journey, and only answered in
  monosyllables.</p>

  <p>Again in the privacy of his office, he took the torn letter and carefully
  pieced it together on his desk. It bore no address, and there were no
  affectionate preliminaries:</p>

  <p>You must get out of London. Saul Arthur Mann saw you both to-day. Go to
  the old place and await instructions.</p>

  <p>There was no signature, but across the table the two men looked at one
  another, for the writing was the writing of Jasper Cole.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap16"
     id="chap16">XVI. THE COMING OF SERGEANT SMITH</a></h2>

  <p>Jasper Cole at that moment was trudging through the snow to the little
  ch&acirc;let which May Nuttall had taken on the slope of the mountain
  overlooking Chamonix. The sleigh which had brought him up from the station
  was at the foot of the rise. May saw him from the veranda, and coo-ooed a
  welcome. He stamped the snow from his boots and ran up the steps of the
  veranda to meet her.</p>

  <p>"This is a very pleasant surprise," she said, giving him both her hands
  and looking at him approvingly. He had lost much of his pallor, and his face
  was tanned and healthy, though a little fine drawn.</p>

  <p>"It was rather a mad thing to do, wasn't it?" he confessed ruefully.</p>

  <p>"You are such a confirmed bachelor, Jasper, that I believe you hate doing
  anything outside your regular routine. Why did you come all the way from
  Holland to the Haute Savoie?"</p>

  <p>He had followed her into the warm and cozy sitting room, and was warming
  his chilled fingers by the big log fire which burned on the hearth.</p>

  <p>"Can you ask? I came to see you."</p>

  <p>"And how are all the experiments going?"</p>

  <p>She turned him to another topic in some hurry.</p>

  <p>"There have been no experiments since last month; at least not the kind of
  experiments you mean. The one in which I have been engaged has been very
  successful."</p>

  <p>"And what was that?" she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you one of these days," he said.</p>

  <p>He was staying at the H&ocirc;tel des Alpes, and hoped to be a week in
  Chamonix. They chatted about the weather, the early snow which had covered
  the valley in a mantle of white, about the tantalizing behavior of Mont
  Blanc, which had not been visible since May had arrived, of the early
  avalanches, which awakened her with their thunder on the night of her
  arrival, of the pleasant road to Argenti&egrave;res, of the villages by the
  Col de Balme, which are buried in snow, of the sparkling, ethereal green of
  the great glacier&mdash;of everything save that which was nearest to their
  thoughts and to their hearts.</p>

  <p>Jasper broke the ice when he referred to Frank's visit to Geneva.</p>

  <p>"How did you know?" she asked, suddenly grave.</p>

  <p>"Somebody told me," he said casually.</p>

  <p>"Jasper, were you ever at Montreux?" she asked, looking him straight in
  the eye.</p>

  <p>"I have been to Montreux, or rather to Caux," he said. "That is the
  village on the mountain above, and one has to go through Montreux to reach
  it. Why did you ask?"</p>

  <p>A sudden chill had fallen upon her, which she did not shake off that day
  or the next.</p>

  <p>They made the usual excursions together, climbed up the wooded slopes of
  the Butte, and on the third morning after his arrival stood together in the
  clear dawn and watched the first pink rays of the sun striking the humped
  summit of Mont Blanc.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it glorious?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>The serene beauty of it all, the purity, the majestic aloofness of
  mountains at once depressed and exalted her, brought her nearer to the
  sublimity of ancient truths, cleansed her of petty fears. She turned to him
  unexpectedly and asked:</p>

  <p>"Jasper, who killed John Minute?"</p>

  <p>He made no reply. His wistful eyes were fixed hungrily upon the glories of
  light and shade, of space, of inaccessibility, of purity, of coloring, of all
  that dawn upon Mont Blanc comprehended. When he spoke his voice was lowered
  to almost a whisper.</p>

  <p>"I know that the man who killed John Minute is alive and free," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Who was he?"</p>

  <p>"If you do not know now, you may never know," he said.</p>

  <p>There was a silence which lasted for fully five minutes, and the crimson
  light upon the mountain top had paled to lemon yellow.</p>

  <p>Then she asked again:</p>

  <p>"Are you directly or indirectly guilty?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Neither directly nor indirectly," he said shortly, and the next minute
  she was in his arms.</p>

  <p>There had been no word of love between them, no tender passage, no letter
  which the world could not read. It was a love-making which had begun where
  other love-makings end&mdash;in conquest and in surrender. In this strange
  way, beyond all understanding, May Nuttall became engaged, and announced the
  fact in the briefest of letters to her friends.</p>

  <p>A fortnight later the girl arrived in England, and was met at Charing
  Cross by Saul Arthur Mann. She was radiantly happy and bubbling over with
  good spirits, a picture of health and beauty.</p>

  <p>All this Mr. Mann observed with a sinking heart. He had a duty to perform,
  and that duty was not a pleasant one. He knew it was useless to reason with
  the girl. He could offer her no more than half-formed theories and
  suspicions, but at least he had one trump card. He debated in his mind
  whether he should play this, for here, too, his information was of the
  scantiest description. He carried his account of the girl to Frank
  Merrill.</p>

  <p>"My dear Frank, she is simply infatuated," said the little man in despair.
  "Oh, if that infernal record of mine was only completed I could convince her
  in a second! There is no single investigation I have ever undertaken which
  has been so disappointing."</p>

  <p>"Can nothing be done?" asked Frank, "I cannot believe that it will happen.
  Marry Jasper! Great C&aelig;sar! After all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His voice was hoarse. The hand he raised in protest shook.</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann scratched his chin reflectively.</p>

  <p>"Suppose you saw her," he suggested, and added a little grimly: "I will
  see Mr. Cole at the same time."</p>

  <p>Frank hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I can understand your reluctance," the little man went on, "but there is
  too much at stake to allow your finer feelings to stop you. This matter has
  got to be prevented at all costs. We are fighting for time. In a month,
  possibly less, we may have the whole of the facts in our hands."</p>

  <p>"Have you found out anything about the girl in Camden Town?" asked
  Frank.</p>

  <p>"She has disappeared completely," replied the other. "Every clew we have
  had has led nowhere."</p>

  <p>Frank dressed himself with unusual care that afternoon, and, having
  previously telephoned and secured the girl's permission to call, he presented
  himself to the minute. She was, as usual, cordiality itself.</p>

  <p>"I was rather hurt at your not calling before, Frank," she said. "You have
  come to congratulate me?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him straight in the eyes as she said this.</p>

  <p>"You can hardly expect that, May," he said gently, "knowing how much you
  are to me and how greatly I wanted you. Honestly, I cannot understand it, and
  I can only suppose that you, whom I love better than anything in the
  world&mdash;and you mean more to me than any other being&mdash;share the
  suspicion which surrounds me like a poison cloud."</p>

  <p>"Yet if I shared that suspicion," she said calmly, "would I let you see
  me? No, Frank, I was a child when&mdash;you know. It was only a few months
  ago, but I believe&mdash;indeed I know&mdash;it would have been the greatest
  mistake I could possibly have made. I should have been a very unhappy woman,
  for I have loved Jasper all along."</p>

  <p>She said this evenly, without any display of emotion or embarrassment.
  Frank, narrating the interview to Saul Arthur Mann, described the speech as
  almost mechanical.</p>

  <p>"I hope you are going to take it nicely," she went on, "that we are going
  to be such good friends as we always were, and that even the memory of your
  poor uncle's death and the ghastly trial which followed and the part that
  Jasper played will not spoil our friendship."</p>

  <p>"But don't you see what it means to me?" he burst forth, and for a second
  they looked at one another, and Frank divined her thoughts and winced.</p>

  <p>"I know what you are thinking," he said huskily; "you are thinking of all
  the beastly things that were said at the trial, that if I had gained you I
  should have gained all that I tried to gain."</p>

  <p>She went red.</p>

  <p>"It was horrid of me, wasn't it?" she confessed. "And yet that idea came
  to me. One cannot control one's thoughts, Frank, and you must be content to
  know that I believe in your innocence. There are some thoughts which flourish
  in one's mind like weeds, and which refuse to be uprooted. Don't blame me if
  I recalled the lawyer's words; it was an involuntary, hateful thought."</p>

  <p>He inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"There is another thought which is not involuntary," she went on, "and it
  is because I want to retain our friendship and I want everything to go on as
  usual that I am asking you one question. Your twenty-fourth birthday has come
  and gone; you told me that your uncle's design was to keep you unmarried
  until that day. You are still unmarried, and your twenty-fourth birthday has
  passed. What has happened?"</p>

  <p>"Many things have happened," he replied quietly. "My uncle is dead. I am a
  rich man apart from the accident of his legacy. I could meet you on level
  terms."</p>

  <p>"I knew nothing of this," she said quickly.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Didn't Jasper tell you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;Jasper told me nothing."</p>

  <p>Frank drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"Then I can only say that until the mystery of my uncle's death is solved
  you cannot know," he said. "I can only repeat what I have already told
  you."</p>

  <p>She offered her hand.</p>

  <p>"I believe you, Frank," she said, "and I was wrong even to doubt you in
  the smallest degree."</p>

  <p>He took her hand and held it.</p>

  <p>"May," he said, "what is this strange fascination that Jasper has over
  you?"</p>

  <p>For the second time in that interview she flushed and pulled her hand
  back.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing unusual in the fascination which Jasper exercises," she
  smiled, quickly recovering, almost against her will, from the little twinge
  of anger she felt. "It is the influence which every woman has felt and which
  you one day will feel."</p>

  <p>He laughed bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Then nothing will make you change your mind?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Nothing in the world," she answered emphatically.</p>

  <p>For a moment she was sorry for him, as he stood, both hands resting on a
  chair, his eyes on the ground, a picture of despair, and she crossed to him
  and slipped her arm through his.</p>

  <p>"Don't take it so badly, Frank," she said softly. "I am a capricious,
  foolish girl, I know, and I am really not worth a moment's suffering."</p>

  <p>He shook himself together, gathered up his hat, his stick, and his
  overcoat and offered his hand.</p>

  <p>"Good-by," he said, "and good luck!"</p>

  <p>In the meantime another interview of a widely different character was
  taking place in the little house which Jasper Cole occupied on the Portsmouth
  Road. Jasper and Saul Arthur Mann had met before, but this was the first
  visit that the investigator had paid to the home of John Minute's heir.</p>

  <p>Jasper was waiting at the door to greet the little man when he arrived,
  and had offered him a quiet but warm welcome and led the way to the beautiful
  study which was half laboratory, which he had built for himself since John
  Minute's death.</p>

  <p>"I am coming straight to the point without any beating about the bush, Mr.
  Cole," said the little man, depositing his bag on the side of his chair and
  opening it with a jerk. "I will tell you frankly that I am acting on Mr.
  Merrill's behalf and that I am also acting, as I believe, in the interests of
  justice."</p>

  <p>"Your motives, at any rate, are admirable," said Jasper, pushing back the
  papers which littered his big library table, and seating himself on the
  edge.</p>

  <p>"You are probably aware that you are to some extent under suspicion, Mr.
  Cole."</p>

  <p>"Under your suspicion or the suspicion of the authorities?" asked the
  other coolly.</p>

  <p>"Under mine," said Saul Arthur Mann emphatically. "I cannot speak for the
  authorities."</p>

  <p>"In what direction does this suspicion run?"</p>

  <p>He thrust his hands deep in his trousers pockets, and eyed the other
  keenly.</p>

  <p>"My first suspicion is that you are well aware as to who murdered John
  Minute."</p>

  <p>Jasper Cole nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am perfectly aware that he was murdered by your friend, Mr. Merrill,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>"I suggest," said Saul Arthur Mann calmly, "that you know the murderer,
  and you know the murderer was <i>not</i> Frank Merrill."</p>

  <p>Jasper made no reply, and a faint smile flickered for a second at the
  corner of his mouth, but he gave no other sign of his inward feelings.</p>

  <p>"And the other point you wish to raise?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The other is a more delicate subject, since it involves a lady," said the
  little man. "You are about to be married to Miss Nuttall."</p>

  <p>Jasper Cole nodded.</p>

  <p>"You have obtained an extraordinary influence over the lady in this past
  few months."</p>

  <p>"I hope so," said the other cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"It is an influence which might have been brought about by normal methods,
  but it is also one," Saul Arthur leaned over and tapped the table
  emphatically with each word, "which might be secured by a very clever chemist
  who had found a way of sapping the will of his victim."</p>

  <p>"By the administration of drugs?" asked Jasper.</p>

  <p>"By the administration of drugs," repeated Saul Arthur Mann.</p>

  <p>Jasper Cole smiled.</p>

  <p>"I should like to know the drug," he said. "One would make a fortune, to
  say nothing of benefiting humanity to an extraordinary degree by its
  employment. For example, I might give you a dose and you would tell me all
  that you know; I am told that your knowledge is fairly extensive," he
  bantered. "Surely you, Mr. Mann, with your remarkable collection of
  information on all subjects under the sun, do not suggest that such a drug
  exists?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," said "The Man Who Knew" in triumph, "it is known and is
  employed. It was known as long ago as the days of the Borgias. It was
  employed in France in the days of Louis XVI. It has been, to some extent,
  rediscovered and used in lunatic asylums to quiet dangerous patients."</p>

  <p>He saw the interest deepen in the other's eyes.</p>

  <p>"I have never heard of that," said Jasper slowly; "the only drug that is
  employed for that purpose is, as far as I know, bromide of potassium."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mann produced a slip of paper, and read off a list of names, mostly of
  mental institutions in the United States of America and in Germany.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that drug!" said Jasper Cole contemptuously. "I know the use to which
  that is put. There was an article on the subject in the <i>British Medical
  Journal</i> three months ago. It is a modified kind of 'twilight
  sleep'&mdash;hyocine and morphia. I'm afraid, Mr. Mann," he went on, "you
  have come on a fruitless errand, and, speaking as a humble student of
  science, I may suggest without offense that your theories are wholly
  fantastic."</p>

  <p>"Then I will put another suggestion to you, Mr. Cole," said the little man
  without resentment, "and to me this constitutes the chief reason why you
  should not marry the lady whose confidence I enjoy and who, I feel sure, will
  be influenced by my advice."</p>

  <p>"And what is that?" asked Jasper.</p>

  <p>"It affects your own character, and it is in consequence a very
  embarrassing matter for me to discuss," said the little man.</p>

  <p>Again the other favored him with that inscrutable smile of his.</p>

  <p>"My moral character, I presume, is now being assailed," he said
  flippantly. "Please go on; you promise to be interesting."</p>

  <p>"You were in Holland a short time ago. Does Miss Nuttall know this?"</p>

  <p>Jasper nodded.</p>

  <p>"She is well aware of the fact."</p>

  <p>"You were in Holland with a lady," accused Mr. Mann slowly. "Is Miss
  Nuttall well aware of this fact, too?"</p>

  <p>Jasper slipped from the table and stood upright. Through his narrow lids
  he looked down upon his accuser.</p>

  <p>"Is that all you know?" he asked softly.</p>

  <p>"Not all, but one of the things I know," retorted the other. "You were
  seen in her company. She was staying in the same hotel with you as 'Mrs.
  Cole.'"</p>

  <p>Jasper nodded.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me if I decline to discuss the matter," he said.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I ask Miss Nuttall to discuss it?" challenged the little man.</p>

  <p>"You are the master of your own actions," said Jasper Cole quickly, "and I
  dare say, if you regard it as expedient, you will tell her, but I can promise
  you that whether you tell her or not I shall marry Miss Nuttall."</p>

  <p>With this he ushered his visitor to the door, and hardly waited for the
  car to drive off before he had shut that door behind him.</p>

  <p>Late that night the two friends forgathered and exchanged their
  experiences.</p>

  <p>"I am sure there is something very wrong indeed," said Frank emphatically.
  "She was not herself. She spoke mechanically, almost as though she were
  reciting a lesson. You had the feeling that she was connected by wires with
  somebody who was dictating her every word and action. It is damnable, Mann.
  What can we do?"</p>

  <p>"We must prevent the marriage," said the little man quietly, "and employ
  every means that opportunity suggests to that purpose. Make no mistake," he
  said emphatically; "Cole will stop at nothing. His attitude was one big
  bluff. He knows that I have beaten him. It was only by luck that I found out
  about the woman in Holland. I got my agent to examine the hotel register, and
  there it was, without any attempt at disguise: 'Mr. and Mrs. Cole, of
  London.'"</p>

  <p>"The thing to do is to see May at once," said Frank, "and put all the
  facts before her, though I hate the idea; it seems like sneaking."</p>

  <p>"Sneaking!" exploded Saul Arthur Mann. "What nonsense you talk! You are
  too full of scruples, my friend, for this work. I will see her to-
  morrow."</p>

  <p>"I will go with you," said Frank, after a moment's thought. "I have no
  wish to escape my responsibility in the matter. She will probably hate me for
  my interference, but I have reached beyond the point where I care &mdash;so
  long as she can be saved."</p>

  <p>It was agreed that they should meet one another at the office in the
  morning and make their way together.</p>

  <p>"Remember this," said Mann, seriously, before they parted, "that if Cole
  finds the game is up he will stop at nothing."</p>

  <p>"Do you think we ought to take precautions?" asked Frank.</p>

  <p>"Honestly I do," confessed the other, "I don't think we can get the men
  from the Yard, but there is a very excellent agency which sometimes works for
  me, and they can provide a guard for the girl."</p>

  <p>"I wish you would get in touch with them," said Frank earnestly. "I am
  worried sick over this business. She ought never to be left out of their
  sight. I will see if I can have a talk to her maid, so that we may know
  whenever she is going out. There ought to be a man on a motor cycle always
  waiting about the Savoy to follow her wherever she goes."</p>

  <p>They parted at the entrance of the bureau, Saul Arthur Mann returning to
  telephone the necessary instructions. How necessary they were was proved that
  very night.</p>

  <p>At nine o'clock May was sitting down to a solitary dinner when a telegram
  was delivered to her. It was from the chief of the little mission in which
  she had been interested, and ran:</p>

  <p>Very urgent. Have something of the greatest importance to tell you.</p>

  <p>It was signed with the name of the matron of the mission, and, leaving her
  dinner untouched, May only delayed long enough to change her dress before she
  was speeding in a taxi eastward.</p>

  <p>She arrived at the "hall," which was the headquarters of the mission, to
  find it in darkness. A man who was evidently a new helper was waiting in the
  doorway and addressed her.</p>

  <p>"You are Miss Nuttall, aren't you? I thought so. The matron has gone down
  to Silvers Rents, and she asked me to go along with you."</p>

  <p>The girl dismissed the taxi, and in company with her guide threaded the
  narrow tangle of streets between the mission and Silvers Rents. She was
  halfway along one of the ill-lighted thoroughfares when she noticed that
  drawn up by the side of the road was a big, handsome motor car, and she
  wondered what had brought this evidence of luxurious living to the mean
  streets of Canning Town. She was not left in doubt very long, for as she came
  up to the lights and was shielding her eyes from their glare her arms were
  tightly grasped, a shawl was thrown over her head, and she was lifted and
  thrust into the car's interior. A hand gripped her throat.</p>

  <p>"You scream and I will kill you!" hissed a voice in her ear.</p>

  <p>At that moment the car started, and the girl, with a scream which was
  strangled in her throat, fell swooning back on the seat.</p>

  <p>May recovered consciousness to find the car still rushing forward in the
  dark and the hand of her captor still resting at her throat.</p>

  <p>"You be a sensible girl," said a muffled voice, "and do as you're told and
  no harm will come to you."</p>

  <p>It was too dark to see his face, and it was evident that even if there
  were light the face was so well concealed that she could not recognize the
  speaker. Then she remembered that this man, who had acted as her guide, had
  been careful to keep in the shadow of whatever light there was while he was
  conducting her, as he said, to the matron.</p>

  <p>"Where are you taking me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You'll know in time," was the noncommittal answer.</p>

  <p>It was a wild night; rain splashed against the windows of the car, and she
  could hear the wind howling above the noise of the engines. They were
  evidently going into the country, for now and again, by the light of the
  headlamps, she glimpsed hedges and trees which flashed past. Her captor
  suddenly let down one of the windows and leaned out, giving some instructions
  to the driver. What they were she guessed, for the lights were suddenly
  switched off and the car ran in darkness.</p>

  <p>The girl was in a panic for all her bold showing. She knew that this
  desperate man was fearless of consequence, and that, if her death would
  achieve his ends and the ends of his partners, her life was in imminent
  peril. What were those ends, she wondered. Were these the same men who had
  done to death John Minute?</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>There was a little, chuckling laugh.</p>

  <p>"You'll know soon enough."</p>

  <p>The words were hardly out of his mouth when there was a terrific crash.
  The car stopped suddenly and canted over, and the girl was jerked forward to
  her knees. Every pane of glass in the car was smashed, and it was clear, from
  the angle at which it lay, that irremediable damage had been done. The man
  scrambled up, kicked open the door, and jumped out.</p>

  <p>"Level-crossing gate, sir," said the voice of the chauffeur. "I've broken
  my wrist."</p>

  <p>With the disappearance of her captor, the girl had felt for the fastening
  of the opposite door, and had turned it. To her delight it opened smoothly,
  and had evidently been unaffected by the jam. She stepped out to the road,
  trembling in every limb.</p>

  <p>She felt, rather than saw, the level-crossing gate, and knew that at one
  side was a swing gate for passengers. She reached this when her abductor
  discovered her flight.</p>

  <p>"Come back!" he cried hoarsely.</p>

  <p>She heard a roar and saw a flashing of lights and fled across the line
  just as an express train came flying northward. It missed her by inches, and
  the force of the wind threw her to the ground. She scrambled up, stumbled
  across the remaining rails, and, reaching the gate opposite, fled down the
  dark road She had gained just that much time which the train took in passing.
  She ran blindly along the dark road, slipping and stumbling in the mud, and
  she heard her pursuer squelching through the mud in the rear.</p>

  <p>The wind flew her hair awry, the rain beat down upon her face, but she
  stumbled on. Suddenly she slipped and fell, and as she struggled to her feet
  the heavy hand of her pursuer fell upon her shoulder, and she screamed
  aloud.</p>

  <p>"None of that," said the voice, and his hand covered her mouth.</p>

  <p>At that moment a bright light enveloped the two, a light so intensely,
  dazzlingly white, so unexpected that it hit the girl almost like a blow. It
  came from somewhere not two yards away, and the man released his hold upon
  the girl and stared at the light.</p>

  <p>"Hello!" said a voice from the darkness. "What's the game?"</p>

  <p>She was behind the man, and could not see his face. All that she knew was
  that here was help, unexpected, Heaven sent, and she strove to recover her
  breath and her speech.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," growled the man. "She's a lunatic and I'm taking her to
  the asylum."</p>

  <p>Suddenly the light was pushed forward to the man's face, and a heavy hand
  was laid upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You are, are you?" said the other. "Well, I am going to take you to a
  lunatic asylum, Sergeant Smith or Crawley or whatever your name is. You know
  me; my name's Wiseman."</p>

  <p>For a moment the man stood as though petrified, and then, with a sudden
  jerk, he wrenched his hand free and sprang at the policeman with a wild yell
  of rage, and in a second both men were rolling over in the darkness.
  Constable Wiseman was no child, but he had lost his initial advantage, and by
  the time he got to his feet and had found his electric torch Crawley had
  vanished.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap17"
     id="chap17">XVII. THE MAN CALLED "MERRILL"</a></h2>

  <p>"If Wiseman did not think you were a murderer, I should regard him as an
  intelligent being," said Saul Arthur Mann.</p>

  <p>"Have they found Crawley?" asked Frank.</p>

  <p>"No, he got away. The chauffeur and the car were hired from a West End
  garage, with this story of a lunatic who had to be removed to an asylum, and
  apparently Crawley, or Smith, was the man who hired them. He even paid a
  little extra for the damage which the alleged lunatic might do the car. The
  chauffeur says that he had some doubt, and had intended to inform the police
  after he had arrived at his destination. As a matter of fact, they were just
  outside Eastbourne when the accident occurred." "The Man Who Knew"
  paused.</p>

  <p>"Where did he say he was taking her?" he asked Frank.</p>

  <p>"He was told to drive into Eastbourne, where more detailed instructions
  would be given to him. The police have confirmed his story, and he has been
  released.</p>

  <p>"I have just come from May," said Frank. "She looks none the worse for her
  exciting adventure. I hope you have arranged to have her guarded?"</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann nodded.</p>

  <p>"It will be the last adventure of that kind our friend will attempt," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Still, this enlightens us a little. We know that Mr. Rex Holland has an
  accomplice, and that accomplice is Sergeant Smith, so we may presume that
  they were both in the murder. Constable Wiseman has been suitably rewarded,
  as he well deserves," said Frank heartily.</p>

  <p>"You bear no malice," smiled Saul Arthur Mann.</p>

  <p>Frank laughed, and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"How can one?" he asked simply.</p>

  <p>May had another visitor. Jasper Cole came hurriedly to London at the first
  intimation of the outrage, but was reassured by the girl's appearance.</p>

  <p>"It was awfully thrilling," she said, "but really I am not greatly
  distressed; in fact, I think I look less tired than you."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is very possible. I did not go to bed until very late this morning,"
  he said. "I was so engrossed in my research work that I did not realize it
  was morning until they brought me my tea."</p>

  <p>"You haven't been in bed all night?" she said, shocked, and shook her head
  reprovingly. "That is one of your habits of life which will have to be
  changed," she warned him.</p>

  <p>Jasper Cole did not dismiss her unpleasant experience as lightly as
  she.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what the object of it all was," he said, "and why they took you
  back to Eastbourne? I think we shall find that the headquarters of this
  infernal combination is somewhere in Sussex."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Mann doesn't think so," she said, "but believes that the car was to
  be met by another at Eastbourne and I was to be transferred. He says that the
  idea of taking me there was to throw the police off the scent."</p>

  <p>She shivered.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't a nice experience," she confessed.</p>

  <p>The interview took place in the afternoon, and was some two hours after
  Frank had interviewed the girl; Saul Arthur Mann had gone to Eastbourne to
  bring her back. Jasper had arranged to spend the night in town, and had
  booked two stalls at the Hippodrome. She had told Saul Arthur Mann this, in
  accordance with her promise to keep him informed as to her movements, and she
  was, therefore, surprised when, half an hour later, the little investigator
  presented himself.</p>

  <p>She met him in the presence of her fianc&eacute;, and it was clear to
  Jasper what Saul Arthur Mann's intentions were.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to make myself a nuisance," he said, "but before we go any
  further, Miss Nuttall, there are certain matters on which you ought to be
  informed. I have every reason to believe that I know who was responsible for
  the outrage of last night, and I do not intend risking a repetition."</p>

  <p>"Who do you think was responsible?" asked the girl quietly.</p>

  <p>"I honestly believe that the author is in this room," was the startling
  response.</p>

  <p>"You mean me?" asked Jasper Cole angrily.</p>

  <p>"I mean you, Mr. Cole. I believe that you are the man who planned the coup
  and that you are its sole author," said the other.</p>

  <p>The girl stared at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"You surely do not mean what you say."</p>

  <p>"I mean that Mr. Cole has every reason for wishing to marry you," he said.
  "What that reason is I do not know completely, but I shall discover. I am
  satisfied," he went on slowly, "that Mr. Cole is already married."</p>

  <p>She looked from one to the other.</p>

  <p>"Already married?" repeated Jasper.</p>

  <p>"If he is not already married," said Saul Arthur Mann bluntly, "then I
  have been indiscreet. The only thing I can tell you is that your
  fianc&eacute; has been traveling on the Continent with a lady who describes
  herself as Mrs. Cole."</p>

  <p>Jasper said nothing for a moment, but looked at the other oddly and
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I understand, Mr. Mann," he said at length, "that you collect facts as
  other people collect postage stamps?"</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann bristled.</p>

  <p>"You may carry this off, sir," he began, "if you can&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let me speak," said Jasper Cole, raising his voice. "I want to ask you
  this: Have you a complete record of John Minute's life?"</p>

  <p>"I know it so well," said Saul Arthur Mann emphatically, "that I could
  repeat his history word for word."</p>

  <p>"Will you sit down, May?" said Jasper, taking the girl's hand in his and
  gently forcing her to a chair. "We are going to put Mr. Mann's memory to the
  test."</p>

  <p>"Do you seriously mean that you want me to repeat that history?" asked the
  other suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I mean just that," said Jasper, and drew up a chair for his unpleasant
  visitor.</p>

  <p>The record of John Minute's life came trippingly from Mann's tongue. He
  knew to an extraordinary extent the details of that strange and wild
  career.</p>

  <p>"In 1892," said the investigator, continuing his narrative, "he was
  married at St. Bride's church, Port Elizabeth, to Agnes Gertrude Cole."</p>

  <p>"Cole," murmured Jasper.</p>

  <p>The little man looked at him with open mouth.</p>

  <p>"Cole! Good Lord&mdash;you are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am his son," said Jasper quietly. "I am one of his two children. Your
  information is that there was one. As a matter of fact, there were two. My
  mother left my father with one of the greatest scoundrels that has ever
  lived. He took her to Australia, where my sister was born six months after
  she had left John Minute. There her friend deserted her, and she worked for
  seven years as a kitchen maid, in Melbourne, in order to save up enough money
  to bring us to Cape Town. My mother opened a tea shop off Aderley Street, and
  earned enough to educate me and my sister. It was there she met Crawley, and
  Crawley promised to use his influence with my father to bring about a
  reconciliation for her children's sake. I do not know what was the result of
  his attempt, but I gather it was unsuccessful, and things went on very much
  as they were before.</p>

  <p>"Then one day, when I was still at the South African College, my mother
  went home, taking my sister with her. I have reason to believe that Crawley
  was responsible for her sailing and that he met them on landing. All that I
  knew was that from that day my mother disappeared. She had left me a sum of
  money to continue my studies, but after eight months had passed, and no word
  had come from her, I decided to go on to England. I have since learned what
  had happened. My mother had been seized with a stroke and had been conveyed
  to the workhouse infirmary by Crawley, who had left her there and had taken
  my sister, who apparently he passed off as his own daughter.</p>

  <p>"I did not know this at the time, but being well aware of my father's
  identity I wrote to him, asking him for help to discover my mother. He
  answered, telling me that my mother was dead, that Crawley had told him so,
  and that there was no trace of Marguerite, my sister. We exchanged a good
  many letters, and then my father asked me to come and act as his secretary
  and assist him in his search for Marguerite. What he did not know was that
  Crawley's alleged daughter, whom he had not seen, was the girl for whom he
  was seeking. I fell into the new life, and found John Minute&mdash;I can
  scarcely call him 'father'&mdash;much more bearable than I expected&mdash;and
  then one day I found my mother."</p>

  <p>"You found your mother?" said Saul Arthur Mann, a light dawning upon
  him.</p>

  <p>"Your persistent search of the little house in Silvers Rents produced
  nothing," he smiled. "Had you taken the bamboo ladder and crossed the yard at
  the back of the house into another yard, then through the door, you would
  have come to Number 16 Royston Court, and you would have been considerably
  surprised to find an interior much more luxurious than you would have
  expected in that quarter. In Royston Court they spoke of Number 16 as 'the
  house with the nurses' because there were always three nurses on duty, and
  nobody ever saw the inside of the house but themselves. There you would have
  found my mother, bedridden, and, indeed, so ill that the doctors who saw her
  would not allow her to be moved from the house.</p>

  <p>"I furnished this hovel piece by piece, generally at night, because I did
  not want to excite the curiosity of the people in the court, nor did I wish
  this matter to reach the ears of John Minute. I felt that while I retained
  his friendship and his confidence there was at least a chance of his
  reconciliation with my mother, and that, before all things, she desired. It
  was not to be," he said sadly. "John Minute was struck down at the moment my
  plans seemed as though they were going to result in complete success.
  Strangely enough, with his death, my mother made an extraordinary recovery,
  and I was able to move her to the Continent. She had always wanted to see
  Holland, France, and at this moment"&mdash;he turned to the girl with a
  smile&mdash;"she is in the ch&acirc;let which you occupied during your
  holiday."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mann was dumfounded. All his pet theories had gone by the board.</p>

  <p>"But what of your sister?" he asked at last.</p>

  <p>A black look gathered in Jasper Cole's face.</p>

  <p>"My sister's whereabouts are known to me now," he said shortly. "For some
  time she lived in Camden Town, at Number 69 Flowerton Road. At the present
  moment she is nearer and is watched night and day, almost as carefully as Mr.
  Mann's agents are watching you." He smiled again at the girl.</p>

  <p>"Watching me?" she said, startled.</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann went red.</p>

  <p>"It was my idea," he said stiffly.</p>

  <p>"And a very excellent one," agreed Jasper, "but unfortunately you
  appointed your guards too late."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mann went back to his office, his brain in a whirl, yet such was his
  habit that he did not allow himself to speculate upon the new and amazing
  situation until he had carefully jotted down every new fact he had
  collected.</p>

  <p>It was astounding that he had overlooked the connection between Jasper
  Cole and John Minute's wife. His labors did not cease until eleven o'clock,
  and he was preparing to go home when the commissionaire who acted as
  caretaker came to tell him that a lady wished to see him.</p>

  <p>"A lady? At this hour of the night?" said Mr. Mann, perturbed. "Tell her
  to come in the morning."</p>

  <p>"I have told her that, sir, but she insists upon seeing you to-
  night."</p>

  <p>"What is her name?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Merrill," said the commissionaire.</p>

  <p>Saul Arthur Mann collapsed into his chair.</p>

  <p>"Show her up," he said feebly.</p>

  <p>He had no difficulty in recognizing the girl, who came timidly into the
  room, as the original of the photograph which had been sent to him by
  Constable Wiseman. She was plainly dressed and wore no ornament, and she was
  undeniably pretty, but there was about her a furtiveness and a nervous
  indecision which spoke of her apprehension.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said Mr. Mann kindly. "What do you want me to do for you?"</p>

  <p>"I am Mrs. Merrill," she said timidly.</p>

  <p>"So the commissionaire said," replied the little man. "You are nervous
  about something?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am so frightened!" said the girl, with a shudder. "If he knows I
  have been here he'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have nothing to be frightened about Just sit here for one
  moment."</p>

  <p>He went into the next room, which had a branch telephone connection, and
  called up May. She was out, and he left an urgent message that she was to
  come, bringing Jasper with her, as soon as she returned. When he got back to
  his office, he found the girl as he had left her, sitting on the edge of a
  big armchair, plucking nervously at her handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I have heard about you," she said. "He mentioned you once&mdash;before we
  went to that Sussex cottage with Mr. Crawley. They were going to bring
  another lady, and I was to look after her, but he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who is 'he'?" asked Mr. Mann.</p>

  <p>"My husband," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been married?" demanded the little man.</p>

  <p>"I ran away with him a long time ago," she said. "It has been an awful
  life; it was Mr. Crawley's idea. He told me that if I married Mr. Merrill he
  would take me to see my mother and Jasper. But he was so cruel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shuddered again.</p>

  <p>"We've been living in furnished houses all over the country, and I have
  been alone most of the time, and he would not let me go out by myself or do
  anything."</p>

  <p>She spoke in a subdued, monotonous tone that betrayed the nearness of a
  bad, nervous breakdown.</p>

  <p>"What does your husband call himself?"</p>

  <p>"Why, Frank Merrill," said the girl in astonishment; "that's his name. Mr.
  Crawley always told me his name was Merrill. Isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mann shook his head.</p>

  <p>"My poor girl," he said sympathetically, "I am afraid you have been
  grossly deceived. The man you married as Merrill is an impostor."</p>

  <p>"An impostor?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mann nodded.</p>

  <p>"He has taken a good man's name, and I am afraid has committed abominable
  crimes in that man's name," said the investigator gently. "I hope we shall be
  able to rid you and the world of a great villain."</p>

  <p>Still she stared uncomprehendingly.</p>

  <p>"He has always been a liar," she said slowly. "He lied naturally and acted
  things so well that you believed him. He told me things which I know aren't
  true. He told me my brother was dead, but I saw his name in the paper the
  other day, and that is why I came to you. Do you know Jasper?"</p>

  <p>She was as na&iuml;ve and as unsophisticated as a schoolgirl, and it made
  the little man's heart ache to hear the plaintive monotony of tone and see
  the trembling lip.</p>

  <p>"I promise you that you will meet your brother," he said.</p>

  <p>"I have run away from Frank," she said suddenly. "Isn't that a wicked
  thing to do? I could not stand it. He struck me again yesterday, and he
  pretends to be a gentleman. My mother used to say that no gentleman ever
  treats a woman badly, but Frank does."</p>

  <p>"Nobody shall treat you badly any more," said Mr. Mann.</p>

  <p>"I hate him!" she went on with sudden vehemence. "He sneers and says he's
  going to get another wife, and&mdash;oh!"</p>

  <p>He saw her hands go up to her face, and saw her staring eyes turn to the
  door in affright.</p>

  <p>Frank Merrill stood in the doorway, and looked at her without
  recognition.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said. "You have a visitor?"</p>

  <p>"Come in," said Mr. Mann. "I am awfully glad you called."</p>

  <p>The girl had risen to her feet, and was shrinking back to the wall.</p>

  <p>"Do you know this lady?"</p>

  <p>Frank looked at her keenly.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes, that's Sergeant Smith's daughter," he said, and he smiled.
  "Where on earth have you been?"</p>

  <p>"Don't touch me!" she breathed, and put her hands before her, warding him
  off.</p>

  <p>He looked at her in astonishment, and from her to Mann. Then he looked
  back at the girl, his brow wrinkled in perplexity.</p>

  <p>"This girl," said Mr. Mann, "thinks she is your wife."</p>

  <p>"My wife?" said Frank, and looked again at her.</p>

  <p>"Is this a bad joke or something&mdash;do you say that I am your husband?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>She did not speak, but nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>He sat down in a chair and whistled.</p>

  <p>"This rather complicates matters," he said blankly, "but perhaps you can
  explain?"</p>

  <p>"I only know what the girl has told me," said Mr. Mann, shaking his head.
  "I am afraid there is a terrible mistake here."</p>

  <p>Frank turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"But did your husband look like me?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"And did he call himself Frank Merrill?"</p>

  <p>Again she nodded.</p>

  <p>"Where is he now?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, this time at him.</p>

  <p>"But, great heavens," said Frank, with a gesture of despair, "you do not
  suggest that I am the man?"</p>

  <p>"You are the man," said the girl.</p>

  <p>Again Frank looked appealingly at his friend, and Saul Arthur Mann saw
  dismay and laughter in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what I can do," he said. "Perhaps if you left me alone with
  her for a minute&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't! Don't!" she breathed. "Don't leave me alone with him. Stay
  here."</p>

  <p>"And where have you come from now?" asked Frank.</p>

  <p>"From the house where you took me. You struck me yesterday," she went on
  inconsequently.</p>

  <p>Frank laughed.</p>

  <p>"I am not only married, but I am a wife beater apparently," he said
  desperately. "Now what can I do? I think the best thing that can be done is
  for this lady to tell us where she lives and I will take her back and
  confront her husband."</p>

  <p>"I won't go with you!" cried the girl. "I won't! I won't! You said you'd
  look after me, Mr. Mann. You promised."</p>

  <p>The little investigator saw that she was distraught to a point where a
  collapse was imminent.</p>

  <p>"This gentleman will look after you also," he said encouragingly. "He is
  as anxious to save you from your husband as anybody."</p>

  <p>"I will not go," she cried, "If that man touches me," and she pointed to
  Frank, "I'll scream."</p>

  <p>Again came the tap at the door, and Frank looked round.</p>

  <p>"More visitors?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It is all right," said Saul Arthur Mann. "There's a lady and a gentleman
  to see me, isn't there?" he asked the commissionaire. "Show them in."</p>

  <p>May came first, saw the little tableau, and stopped, knowing instinctively
  all that it portended. Jasper followed her.</p>

  <p>The girl, who had been watching Frank, shifted her eyes for a moment to
  the visitors, and at sight of Jasper flung across the room. In an instant her
  brother's arms were around her, and she was sobbing on his breast.</p>

  <p>"Am I entitled to ask what all this means?" asked Frank quietly. "I am
  sure you will overlook my natural irritation, but I have suffered so much and
  I have been the victim of so many surprises that I do not feel inclined to
  accept all the shocks which fate sends me in a spirit of joyful resignation.
  Perhaps you will be good enough to elucidate this new mystery. Is everybody
  mad&mdash;or am I the sole sufferer?"</p>

  <p>"There is no mystery about it," said Jasper, still holding the girl. "I
  think you know this lady?"</p>

  <p>"I have never met her before in my life," said Frank, "but she persists in
  regarding me as her husband for some reason. Is this a new scheme of yours,
  Jasper?"</p>

  <p>"I think you know this lady," said Jasper Cole again.</p>

  <p>Frank shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You are almost monotonous. I repeat that I have never seen her
  before."</p>

  <p>"Then I will explain to you," said Jasper.</p>

  <p>He put the girl gently from him for a moment, and turned and whispered
  something to May. Together they passed out of the room.</p>

  <p>"You were confidential secretary to John Minute for some time, Merrill,
  and in that capacity you made several discoveries. The most remarkable
  discovery was made when Sergeant Smith came to blackmail my father. Oh, don't
  pretend you didn't know that John Minute was my father!" he said in answer to
  the look of amazement on Frank Merrill's face.</p>

  <p>"Smith took you into his confidence, and you married his alleged daughter.
  John Minute discovered this fact, not that he was aware that it was his own
  daughter, or that he thought that your association with my sister was any
  more than an intrigue beneath the dignity of his nephew. You did not think
  the time was ripe to spring a son-in-law upon him, and so you waited until
  you had seen his will. In that will he made no mention of a daughter, because
  the child had been born after his wife had left him, and he refused to
  recognize his paternity.</p>

  <p>"Later, in some doubt as to whether he was doing an injustice to what
  might have been his own child, he endeavored to find her. Had you known of
  those investigations, you could have helped considerably, but as it happened
  you did not. You married her because you thought you would get a share of
  John Minute's millions, and when you found your plan had miscarried you
  planned an act of bigamy in order to secure a portion of Mr. Minute's
  fortune, which you knew would be considerable."</p>

  <p>He turned to Saul Arthur Mann.</p>

  <p>"You think I have not been very energetic in pursuing my inquiries as to
  who killed John Minute? There is the explanation of my tolerance."</p>

  <p>He pointed his finger at Frank.</p>

  <p>"This man is the husband of my sister. To ruin him would have meant
  involving her in that ruin. For a time I thought they were happily married.
  It was only recently that I have discovered the truth."</p>

  <p>Frank shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether to laugh or cry," he said. "I have certainly not
  heard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You will hear more," said Jasper Cole. "I will tell you how the murder
  was committed and who was the mysterious Rex Holland.</p>

  <p>"Your father was a forger. That is known. You also have been forging
  signatures since you were a boy. You were Rex Holland. You came to Eastbourne
  on the night of the murder, and by an ingenious device you secured evidence
  in your favor in advance. Pretending to have lost your ticket, you allowed
  station officials to search you and to testify that you had no weapon. You
  were dropped at the gate of my father's house, and, as soon as the cab driver
  had disappeared, you made your way to where you had hidden your car in a
  field at a short distance from the house.</p>

  <p>"You had arrived there earlier in the evening, and had made your way
  across the metals to Polegate Junction, where you joined the train. As you
  had taken the precaution to have your return ticket clipped in London, your
  trick was not discovered. You had regained your car, and drove up to the
  house ten minutes after you had been seen to disappear through the gateway.
  From your car you had taken the revolver, and with that revolver you murdered
  my father. In order to shield yourself you threw suspicion on me and made
  friends with one of the shrewdest men," he inclined his head toward the
  speechless Mr. Mann, "and through him conveyed those suspicions to
  authoritative quarters. It was you who, having said farewell to Miss Nuttall
  in Geneva, reappeared the same evening at Montreux and wrote a note forging
  my handwriting. It was you who left a torn sheet of paper in the room at
  Number 69 Flowerton Road, also in your writing.</p>

  <p>"You have never moved a step but that I have followed you. My agents have
  been with you day and night ever since the day of the murder. I have waited
  my time, and that has come now."</p>

  <p>Frank heaved a long sigh, and took up his hat.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow morning I shall have a story to tell," he said.</p>

  <p>"You are an excellent actor," said Jasper, "and an excellent liar, but you
  have never deceived me."</p>

  <p>He flung open the door.</p>

  <p>"There is your road. You have twenty thousand pounds which my father left
  you. You have some fifty-five thousand pounds which you buried on the night
  of the murder&mdash;you remember the gardener's trowel in the car?" he said,
  turning to Mann.</p>

  <p>"I give you twenty-four hours to leave England. We cannot try you for the
  murder of John Minute; you can still be tried for the murder of your
  unfortunate servants."</p>

  <p>Frank Merrill made no movement toward the door. He walked over to the
  other end of the room, and stood with his back to them. Then he turned.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes," he said, "I feel that it isn't worth while going on. It has
  been rather a strain&mdash;all this."</p>

  <p>Jasper Cole sprang toward him and caught him as he fell. They laid him
  down, and Saul Arthur Mann called urgently on the telephone for a doctor, but
  Frank Merrill was dead.</p>

  <p>"I knew," said Constable Wiseman, when the story came to him.</p>
