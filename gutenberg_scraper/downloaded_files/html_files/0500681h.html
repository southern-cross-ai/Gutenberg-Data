<p><a name="ch-01"></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTORY--MAINLY ABOUT MISSIONARIES AND THE
CITY OF HANKOW.</h3>

<p>In the first week of February, 1894, I returned to Shanghai
from Japan. It was my intention to go up the Yangtse River as far
as Chungking, and then, dressed as a Chinese, to cross quietly
over Western China, the Chinese Shan States, and Kachin Hills to
the frontier of Burma. The ensuing narrative will tell how easily
and pleasantly this journey, which a few years ago would have
been regarded as a formidable undertaking, can now be done.</p>

<p>The journey was, of course, in no sense one of exploration; it
consisted simply of a voyage of 1500 miles up the Yangtse River,
followed by a quiet, though extended, excursion of another 1500
miles along the great overland highway into Burma, taken by one
who spoke no Chinese, who had no interpreter or companion, who
was unarmed, but who trusted implicitly in the good faith of the
Chinese. Anyone in the world can cross over to Burma in the way I
did, provided he be willing to exercise for a certain number of
weeks or months some endurance--for he will have to travel many
miles on foot over a mountainous country--and much
forbearance.</p>

<p>I went to China possessed with the strong racial antipathy to
the Chinese common to my countrymen, but that feeling has long
since given way to one of lively sympathy and gratitude, and I
shall always look back with pleasure to this journey, during
which I experienced, while traversing provinces as wide as
European kingdoms, uniform kindness and hospitality, and the most
charming courtesy. In my case, at least, the Chinese did not
forget their precept, "deal gently With strangers from afar."</p>

<p>I left Shanghai on Sunday, February 11th, by the Jardine
Matheson's steamer Taiwo. One kind friend, a merchant captain who
had seen life in every important seaport in the world, came down,
though it was past midnight, to bid me farewell. We shook hands
on the wharf, and for the last time. Already he had been promised
the first vacancy in Jardine Matheson's. Some time after my
departure, when I was in Western China, he was appointed one of
the officers of the ill-fated Kowshing, and when this unarmed
transport before the declaration of war was destroyed by a
Japanese gunboat, he was among the slain--struck, I believe, by a
Japanese bullet while struggling for life in the water.</p>

<p>I travelled as a Chinese, dressed in warm Chinese winter
clothing, with a pigtail attached to the inside of my hat. I
could not have been more comfortable. 'I had a small cabin to
myself. I had of course my own bedding, and by paying a Mexican
dollar a day to the Chinese steward, "foreign chow" was brought
me from the saloon. The traveller who cares to travel in this
way, to put his pride in his pocket and a pigtail down his back,
need pay only one-fourth of what it would cost nim to travel as a
European in European dress.</p>

<p>But I was, I found, unwittingly travelling under false
pretences. When the smart chief officer came for my fare he
charged me, I thought, too little. I expressed my surprise, and
said that I thought the fare was seven dollars. "So it is," he
replied "but we only charge missionaries five dollars, and I knew
you were a missionary even before they told me." How different
was his acuteness from that of the Chinese compradore who
received me on the China Merchants' steamer Hsin Chi, in which I
once made a voyage from Shanghai to Tientsin, also in Chinese
dress! The conversation was short, sharp, and emphatic. The
compradore looked at me searchingly. "What pidgin belong you?" he
asked--meaning what is your business? Humbly I answered, "My
belong Jesus Christ pidgin"; that is, I am a missionary, to which
he instantly and with some scorn replied, "No dam fear!"</p>

<p>We called at the river ports and reached Hankow on the 14th.
Hankow, the Chinese say, is the mart of eight provinces and the
centre of the earth. It is the chief distributing centre of the
Yangtse valley, the capital city of the centre of China. The
trade in tea, its staple export, is declining rapidly,
particularly since 1886. Indian opium goes no higher up the river
than this point; its importation into Hankow is now insignificant
amounting to only 738 piculs (44 tons) per .annum. Hankow is on
the left bank of the Yangtse, separated only by the width of the
Han river from Hanyang, and by the width of the Yangtse from
Wuchang; these three divisions really form one large city, with
more inhabitants than the entire population of the colony of
Victoria.</p>

<p>Wuchang is the capital city of the two provinces of Hunan and
Hupeh; it is here that the Viceroy, Chang Chi Tung, resides in
his official yamen and dispenses injustice from a building almost
as handsome as the American mission-houses which overlook it.
Chang Chi Tung is the most anti-foreign of all the Viceroys of
China; yet no Viceroy in the Empire has ever had so many
foreigners in his employ as he. "Within the four seas," he says,
"all men are brothers"; yet the two provinces he rules over are
closed against foreigners, and the missionaries are compelled to
remain under the shelter of the foreign Concession in Hankow.
With a public spirit unusual among Chinese Viceroys he has
devoted the immense revenues of his office to the modern
development of the resources of his vice-kingdom. He has erected
a gigantic cotton-mill at Wuchang with thirty-five thousand
spindles, covering six acres and lit with the electric light, and
with a reservoir of three acres and a half. He has built a large
mint. At Hanyang he has erected magnificent iron-works and blast
furnaces which cover many acres and are provided with all the
latest machinery. He has iron and coal mines, with a railway
seventeen miles long from the mines to the river, and specially
constructed river-steamers and special hoisting machinery at the
river-banks. Money he has poured out like water; he is probably
the only important official in China who will leave office a poor
man.</p>

<p>Acting as private secretary to the Viceroy is a clever Chinese
named Kaw Hong Beng, the author of Defensio Populi, that
often-quoted attack upon missionary methods which appeared first
in The North China Daily News. A linguist of unusual ability, who
publishes in The Daily News translations from Heine in English
verse, Kaw is gifted with a rare command over the resources of
English. He is a Master of Arts of the University of Edinburgh.
Yet, strange paradox, notwithstanding that he had the privilege
of being trained in the most pious and earnest community in the
United Kingdom, under the lights of the United Presbyterian Kirk,
Free Kirk, Episcopalian Church, and The Kirk, not to mention a
large and varied assortment of Dissenting Churches of more or
less dubious orthodoxy, he is openly hostile to the introduction
of Christianity into China. And nowhere in China is the
opposition to the introduction of Christianity more intense than
in the Yangtse valley. In this intensity many thoughtful
missionaries see the greater hope of the ultimate conversion of
this portion of China; opposition they say is a better aid to
missionary success than mere apathy.</p>

<p>During the time I was in China, I met large numbers of
missionaries of all classes, in many cities from Peking to
Canton, and they unanimously expressed satisfaction at the
progress they are making in China. Expressed succinctly, their
harvest may be described as amounting to a fraction more than two
Chinamen per missionary per annum. If, however, the paid ordained
and unordained native helpers be added to the number of
missionaries, you find that the aggregate body converts
nine-tenths of a Chinaman per worker per annum; but the
missionaries deprecate their work being judged by statistics.
There are 1511 Protestant missionaries labouring in the Empire;
and, estimating their results from the statistics of previous
years as published in the Chinese Recorder, we find that they
gathered last year (1893) into the fold 3127 Chinese--not all of
whom it is feared are genuine Christians--at a cost of 350,000
pounds, a sum equal to the combined incomes of the ten chief
London hospitals.</p>

<p>Hankow itself swarms with missionaries, "who are unhappily
divided into so many sects, that even a foreigner is bewildered
by their number, let alone the heathen to whom they are
accredited." (Medhurst.)</p>

<p>Dwelling in well-deserved comfort in and around the foreign
settlement, there are members of the London Missionary Society,
of the Tract Society, of the Local Tract Society, of the British
and Foreign Bible Society, of the National Bible Society of
Scotland, of the American Bible Society; there are Quaker
missionaries, Baptist, Wesleyan, and Independent missionaries of
private means; there are members of the Church Missionary
Society, of the American Board of Missions, and of the American
High Church Episcopal Mission; there is a Medical Mission in
connection with the London Missionary Society, there is a
flourishing French Mission under a bishop, the "Missions
etrangeres de Paris" a Mission of Franciscan Fathers, most of
whom are Italian, and a Spanish Mission of the Order of St.
Augustine.</p>

<p>The China Inland Mission has its chief central distributing
station at Hankow, and here also are the headquarters of a
Scandinavian Mission, of a Danish Mission, and of an unattached
mission, most of the members of which are also Danish. Where
there are so many missions, of so many different sects, and
holding such widely divergent views, it is, I suppose, inevitable
that each mission should look with some disfavour upon the work
done by its neighbours, should have some doubts as to the
expediency of their methods, and some reasonable misgivings as to
the genuineness of their conversions.</p>

<p>The Chinese "Rice Christians," those spurious Christians who
become converted in return for being provided with rice, are just
those who profit by these differences of opinion, and who, with
timely lapses from grace, are said to succeed in being converted
in turn by all the missions from the Augustins to the
Quakers.</p>

<p>Every visitor to Hankow and to all other open ports, who is a
supporter of missionary effort, is pleased to find that his
preconceived notions as to the hardships and discomforts of the
open port missionary in China are entirely false. Comfort and
pleasures of life are there as great as in any other country.
Among the most comfortable residences in Hankow are the quarters
of the missionaries; and it is but right that the missionaries
should be separated as far as possible from all
discomfort--missionaries who are sacrificing all for China, and
who are prepared to undergo any reasonable hardship to bring
enlightenment to this land of darkness.</p>

<p>I called at the headquarters of the Spanish mission of Padres
Agustinos and smoked a cigarette with two of the Padres, and
exchanged reminiscences of Valladolid and Barcelona. And I can
well conceive, having seen the extreme dirtiness of the mission
premises, how little the Spaniard has to alter his ways in order
to make them conform to the more ancient civilisation of the
Chinese.</p>

<p>In Hankow there is a large foreign concession with a handsome
embankment lined by large buildings. There is a rise and fall in
the river between summer and winter levels of nearly sixty feet.
In the summer the river laps the edge of the embankment and may
overflow into the concession; in the winter, broad steps lead
down to the edge of the water which, even when shrunk into its
bed, is still more than half a mile in width. Our handsome
consulate is at one end of the embankment; at the other there is
a remarkable municipal building which was designed by a former
City constable, who was, I hope, more expert with the handcuffs
than he was with the pencil.</p>

<p>Our interests in Hankow are protected by Mr Pelham Warren, the
Consul, one of the ablest men in the Service. I registered at the
Consulate as a British subject and obtained a Chinese passport in
terms of the Treaty of Tientsin for the four provinces Hupeh,
Szechuen, Kweichou, and Yunnan, available for one year from the
date of issue.</p>

<p>I had no servant. An English-speaking "boy," hearing that I
was in need of one, came to me to recommend "his number one
fiend," who, he assured me, spoke English "all the same
Englishman." But when the "flend" came I found that he spoke
English all the same as I spoke Chinese. He was not abashed, but
turned away wrath by saying to me, through an interpreter, "It is
true that I cannot speak the foreign language, but the foreign
gentleman is so clever that in one month he will speak Chinese
beautifully." We did not come to terms.</p>

<p><b>THE AUTHOR'S CHINESE PASSPORT</b></p>
</center>

<p>At Hankow I embarked on the China Merchants' steamer Kweili,
the only triple-screw steamer on the River, and four days later,
on February 2ist, I landed at Ichang, the most inland port on the
Yangtse yet reached by steam. Ichang is an open port; it is the
scene of the anti-foreign riot of September 2nd, 1891, when the
foreign settlement was pillaged and burnt by the mob, aided by
soldiers of the Chentai Loh-Ta-Jen, the head military official in
charge at Ichang, "who gave the outbreak the benefit of his
connivance." Pleasant zest is given to life here in the
anticipation of another outbreak; it is the only excitement.</p>

<p>From Ichang to Chungking--a distance of 412 miles--the river
Yangtse, in a great part of its course, is a series of rapids
which no steamer has yet attempted to ascend, though it is
contended that the difficulties of navigation would not be
insuperable to a specially constructed steamer of elevated
horse-power. Some idea of the speed of the current at this part
of the river may be given by the fact that a junk, taking thirty
to thirty-five days to do the upward journey, hauled most of the
way by gangs of trackers, has been known to do the down-river
journey in two days and a half.</p>

<p>Believing that I could thus save some days on the journey, I
decided to go to Chungking on foot, and engaged a coolie to
accompany me. We were to start on the Thursday afternoon; but
about midnight on Wednesday I met Dr. Aldridge, of the Customs,
who easily persuaded me that by taking the risk of going in a
small boat (a wupan), and not in an ordinary passenger junk (a
kwatze), I might, with luck, reach Chungking as soon by water as
I could reach Wanhsien at half the distance by land. The Doctor
was a man of surprising energy. He offered to arrange everything
for me, and by 6 o'clock in the morning he had engaged a boat,
had selected a captain (laoban), and a picked crew of four young
men, who undertook to land me in Chungking in fifteen days, and
had given them all necessary instructions for my journey. All was
to be ready for a start the same evening.</p>

<p>During the course of the morning the written agreement was
brought me by the laoban, drawn up in Chinese and duly signed, of
which a Chinese clerk made me the following translation into
English. I transcribe it literally:--</p>

<p>Yang Hsing Chung (the laoban) hereby contracts to convey Dr.
M. to Chungking on the following conditions:--</p>

<p>The passage-money agreed upon is 28,000 cash ( 2 pounds 16s.),
which includes all charges.</p>

<p>If Chungking is reached in twelve days, Dr. M. will give the
master 32,500 cash instead; if in thirteen days 31,000, and if in
fifteen days 28,000.</p>

<p>If all goes well and the master does his duty satisfactorily,
Dr. M. will give him 30,000 cash, even if he gets to Chungking in
fifteen days.</p>

<p>The sum of 14,000 cash is tobe advanced to the master before
starting; the remainder to be paid on arrival at Chungking.</p>

<p>(Signed) YANG HSING CHUNG.</p>

<p>Dated the 17th day of the 2nd moon, K, shui 20th year.</p>

<p>The Chinaman who wrote this in English speaks English better
than many Englishmen.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II. FROM ICHANG TO WANHSIEN, WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF
CHINESE WOMEN AND THE RAPIDS OF THE YANGTSE KIANG.</h3>

<p>The agreement was brought me in the morning; all the afternoon
I was busy, and at 8 p.m. I embarked from the Customs pontoon.
The boat was a wupan (five boards), 28 feet long and drawing 8
inches. Its sail was like the wing of a butterfly, with
transverse ribs of light bamboo; its stern was shaped "like a
swallow's wings at rest." An improvised covering of mats
amidships was my crib; and with spare mats, slipt during the day
over the boat's hood, coverings could be made at night for'ard
for my three men and aft for the other two. It seemed a. frail
little craft to face the dangers of the cataracts, but it was
manned by as smart a crew of young Chinese as could be found on
the river. It was pitch dark when we paddled into the stream
amidst a discharge of crackers. As we passed under the Kweili,
men were there to wish me bon voyage, and a revolver was emptied
into the darkness to propitiate the river god.</p>

<p>We paddled up the bank under the sterns of countless junks,
past the walled city, and then, crossing to the other bank, we
made fast and waited for the morning to begin our journey. The
lights of the city were down the river; all was quiet; my men
were in good heart, and there was no doubt whatever that they
would make every effort to fulfil their contract.</p>

<p>At daylight we were away again and soon entered the first of
the great gorges where the river has cleft its way through the
mountains.</p>

<p>With a clear and sunny sky, the river flowing smoothly and
reflecting deeply the lofty and rugged hills which fall steeply
to the water's edge, a light boat, and a model crew, it was a
pleasure to lie at ease wrapped in my Chinese pukai and watch the
many junks lazily falling down the river, the largest of them
"dwarfed by the colossal dimensions of the surrounding scenery to
the size of sampans," and the fishing boats, noiseless but for
the gentle creaking of the sheers and dip-net, silently working
in the still waters under the bank.</p>

<p>At Ping-shan-pa there is an outstation of the Imperial
Maritime Customs in charge of a seafaring man who was once a
cockatoo farmer in South Australia, and drove the first team of
bullocks to the Mount Brown diggings. He lives comfortably in a
house-boat moored to the bank. He is one of the few Englishmen in
China married in the English way, as distinct from the Chinese,
to a Chinese girl. His wife is one of the prettiest girls that
ever came out of Nanking, and talks English delightfully with a
musical voice that is pleasant to listen to. I confess that I am
one of those who agree with the missionary writer in regarding
"the smile of a Chinese woman as inexpressibly charming." I have
seen girls in China who would be considered beautiful in any
capital in Europe. The attractiveness of the Japanese lady has
been the theme of many writers, but, speaking as an impartial
observer who has been both in Japan and China, I have never been
able to come to any other decision than that in every feature the
Chinese woman is superior to her Japanese sister. She is head and
shoulders above the Japanese; she is more intellectual, or,
rather, she is more capable of intellectual development; she is
incomparably more chaste and modest. She is prettier, sweeter,
and more trustworthy than the misshapen cackling little dot with
black teeth that we are asked to admire as a Japanese beauty. The
traveller in China is early impressed by the contrast between the
almost entire freedom from apparent immorality of the Chinese
cities, especially of Western China, and the flaunting indecency
of the Yoshiwaras of Japan, with "their teeming, seething, busy
mass of women, whose virtue is industry and whose industry is
vice."</p>

<p>The small feet of the Chinese women, though admired by the
Chinese and poetically referred to by them as "three-inch gold
lilies," are in our eyes a very unpleasant deformity--but still,
even with this deformity, the walk of the Chinese woman is more
comely than the gait of the Japanese woman as she shambles
ungracefully along with her little bent legs, scraping her
wooden-soled slippers along the pavement with a noise that sets
your teeth on edge. "Girls are like flowers," say the Chinese,
"like the willow. It is very important that their feet should be
bound short so that they can walk beautifully with mincing steps,
swaying gracefully, and thus showing to all that they are persons
of respectability." Apart from the Manchus, the dominant race,
whose women do not bind their feet, all chaste Chinese girls have
small feet. Those who have large feet are either, speaking
generally, ladies of easy virtue or slave girls. And, of course,
no Christian girl is allowed to have her feet bound.</p>

<p><b>ON A BALCONY IN WESTERN CHINA</b></p>
</center>

<p>Leaving Ping-shan-pa with a stiff breeze in our favour we
slowly stemmed the current. Look at the current side, and you
would think we were doing eight knots an hour or more, but look
at the shore side, close to which we kept to escape as far as
possible from the current, and you saw how gradually we felt our
way along.</p>

<p>At a double row of mat sheds filled with huge coils of bamboo
rope of all thicknesses, my laoban went ashore to purchase a
towline; he took with him 1000 cash (about two shillings), and
returned with a coil 100 yards in length and 600 cash of change.
The rope he brought was made of plaited bamboo, was as thick as
the middle finger, and as tough as whalebone.</p>

<p>The country was more open and terraced everywhere into
gardens. Our progress was most satisfactory. When night came we
drew into the bank, and I coiled up in my crib and made myself
comfortable. Space was cramped, and I had barely room to stretch
my legs. My cabin was 5 feet 6 inches square and 4 feet high,
open behind, but with two little doors in front, out of which I
could just manage to squeeze myself sideways round the mast. Coir
matting was next the floor boards, then a thick Chinese quilt (a
pukai), then a Scotch plaid made in Geelong. My pillow was
Chinese, and the hardest part of the bed; my portmanteau was
beside me and served as a desk; a Chinese candle, more wick than
wax, stuck into a turnip, gave me light.</p>

<p>This, our first day's journey, brought us to within sound of
the worst rapid on the river, the Hsintan, and the roar of the
cataract hummed in our ears all night.</p>

<p>Early in the morning we were at the foot of the rapid under
the bank on the opposite side of the river from the town of
Hsintan. It was an exciting scene. A swirling torrent with a roar
like thunder was frothing down the cataract. Above, barriers of
rocks athwart the stream stretched like a weir across the river,
damming the deep still water behind it. The shore was strewn with
boulders. Groups of trackers were on the bank squatting on the
rocks to see the foreign devil and his cockleshell. Other Chinese
were standing where the side-stream is split by the boulders into
narrow races, catching fish with great dexterity, dipping them
out of the water with scoop-nets.</p>

<p>We rested in some smooth water under shelter and put out our
towline; three of my boys jumped ashore and laid hold of it;
another with his bamboo boat-hook stood on the bow; the laoban
was at the tiller; and I was cooped up useless in the well under
the awning. The men started hauling as we pushed out into the sea
of waters. The boat quivered, the water leapt at the bow as if it
would engulf us; our three men were obviously too few. The boat
danced in the rapid. My men on board shrieked excitedly that the
towrope was fouling--it had caught in a rock--but their voices
could not be heard; our trackers were brought to with a jerk; the
hindmost saw the foul and ran back to free it, but he was too
late, for the boat had come beam on to the current. Our captain
frantically waved to let go, and the next moment we were tossed
bodily into the cataract. The boat heeled gunwale under, and
suddenly, but the bowman kept his feet like a Blondin, dropped
the boat-hook, and jumped to unlash the halyard; a wave buried
the boat nose under and swamped me in my kennel; my heart stopped
beating, and, scared out of my wits, I began to strip off my
sodden clothes; but before I had half done the sail had been set;
both men had miraculously fended the boat from a rock, which, by
a moment's hesitation, would have smashed us in bits or buried us
in the boiling trough formed by the eddy below it, and, with
another desperate effort, we had slid from danger into smooth
water. Then my men laughed heartily. How it was done I do not
know, but I felt keen admiration for the calm dexterity with
which it had been done.</p>

<p>We baled the water out of the boat, paid out a second
towrope--this one from the bow to keep the stern under control,
the other being made fast to the mast, and took on board a
licensed pilot. Extra trackers, hired for a few cash, laid hold
of both towlines, and bodily--the water swelling and foaming
under our bows--the boat was hauled against the torrent, and up
the ledge of water that stretches across the river. We were now
in smooth water at the entrance to the Mi Tsang Gorge. Two
stupendous walls of rock, almost perpendicular, as bold and
rugged as the Mediterranean side of the Rock of Gibraltar seem
folded one behind the other across the river. "Savage cliffs are
these, where not a tree and scarcely a blade of grass can grow,
and where the stream, which is rather heard than seen, seems to
be fretting in vain efforts to escape from its dark and gloomy
prison." In the gorge itself the current was restrained, and
boats could cross from bank to bank without difficulty. It was an
eerie feeling to glide over the sunless water shut in by the
stupendous sidewalls of rock. At a sandy spit to the west of the
gorge we landed and put things in order. And here I stood and
watched the junks disappear down the river one after the other,
and I saw the truth of what Hosie had written that, as their
masts are always unshipped in the down passage, the junks seem to
be "passing with their human freight into eternity."</p>

<p>An immensely high declivity with a precipitous face was in
front of us, which strained your eyes to look at; yet high up to
the summit and to the very edge of the precipice, little
farmsteads are dotted, and every yard of land available is under
cultivation.</p>

<p>So steep is it that the scanty soil must be washed away, you
think, at the first rains, and only an adventurous goat could
dwell there in comfort. My laoban, Enjeh, pointing to this mighty
mass, said, "Pin su chiao;" but whether these words were the name
of the place, or were intended to convey to me his sense of its
magnificence, or dealt with the question of the precariousness of
tenure so far above our heads, I had no means to determine.</p>

<p>My laoban knew twelve words of English, and I twelve words of
Chinese, and this was the extent of our common vocabulary; it had
to be carefully eked out with signs and gestures. I knew the
Chinese for rice, flourcake, tea, egg, chopsticks, opium, bed,
by-and-by, how many, charcoal, cabbage, and customs. My laoban
could say in English, or pidgin English, chow, number one, no
good, go ashore, sit down, by-and-by, to-morrow, match, lamp,
alright, one piecee, and goddam. This last named exotic he had
been led to consider as synonymous with "very good." It was not
the first time I had known the words to be misapplied. I remember
reading in the Sydney Bulletin, that a Chinese cook in Sydney
when applying for a situation detailed to the mistress his
undeniable qualifications, concluding with the memorable
announcement, "My Clistian man mum; my eat beef; my say
goddam."</p>

<p>There was a small village behind us. The villagers strolled
down to see the foreigner whom children well in the background
called "Yang kweitze" (foreign devil). Below on the sand, were
the remains of a junk, confiscated for smuggling salt; it had
been sawn bodily in two. Salt is a Government monopoly and a junk
found smuggling it is confiscated on the spot.</p>

<p>Kueichow, on the left bank, is the first walled town we came
to. Here we had infinite difficulty in passing the rapids, and
crossed and recrossed the river several times. I sat in the boat
stripped and shivering, for shipwreck seemed certain, and I did
not wish to be drowned like a rat. For cool daring I never saw
the equal of my boys, and their nicety of judgment was
remarkable. Creeping along close to the bank, every moment in
danger of having its bottom knocked out, the boat would be worked
to the exact point from which the crossing of the river was
feasible, balanced for a moment in the stream, then with sail set
and a clipping breeze, and my men working like demons with the
oars, taking short strokes, and stamping time with their feet,
the boat shot into the current. We made for a rock in the centre
of the river; we missed it, and my heart was in my mouth as I saw
the rapid below us into which we were being drawn, when the boat
mysteriously swung half round and glided under the lee of the
rock. One of the boys leapt out with the bow-rope, and the others
with scull and boat-hook worked the boat round to the upper edge
of the rock, and then, steadying her for the dash across, pushed
off again into the swirling current and made like fiends for the
bank. Standing on the stern, managing the sheet and tiller, and
with his bamboo pole ready, the laoban yelled and stamped in his
excitement; there was the roar of the cataract below us towards
which we were fast edging stern on, destruction again threatened
us and all seemed over, when in that moment we entered the
back-wash and were again in good shelter. And so it went on, my
men with splendid skill doing always the right thing, in the
right way, at the right time, with unerring certainty.</p>

<p>At Yehtan rapid, which is said to be the worst on the river in
the winter, as the Hsintan rapid is in summer, three of the boys
went ashore to haul us up the ledge of water--they were plainly
insufficient. While we were hanging on the cataract extra
trackers appeared from behind the rocks and offered their
services. They could bargain with us at an advantage. It was a
case well known to all Chinese "of speaking of the price after
the pig has been killed." But, when we agreed to their terms,
they laid hold of the towrope and hauled us through in a moment.
Here, as at other dangerous rapids on the river, an official
lifeboat is stationed. It is of broad beam, painted red. The
sailors are paid eighty cash (2d.) a day, and are rewarded with
1000 cash for every life they save, and 800 cash for every
corpse.</p>

<p>Wushan Gorge, the "Witches' Gorge," which extends from
Kuantukou to Wushan-hsien, a distance of twenty miles, is the
longest gorge on the river.</p>

<p>Directly facing us as we emerged from the gorge was the walled
town of Wushan-hsien. Its guardian pagoda, with its seven stories
and its upturned gables, like the rim of an official hat, is
down-stream from the city, and thus prevents wealth and
prosperity being swept by the current past the city.</p>

<p>Beyond there is a short but steep rapid. Before a strong wind
with all sail set we boldly entered it and determined which was
the stronger, the wind or the current. But, while we hung in the
current calling and whistling for the wind, the wind flagged for
a moment; tension being removed, the bow swung into the rocks;
but the water was shallow, and in a trice two of the boys had
jumped into the water and were holding the boat-sides. Then
poling and pulling we crept up the rapid into smooth water. Never
was there any confusion, never a false stroke. To hear my boys
jabber in their unintelligible speech you pictured disorder, and
disaster, and wild excitement; to see them act you witnessed such
coolness, skill, and daring as you had rarely seen before. My
boys were all young. The captain was only twenty, and was a model
of physical grace, with a face that will gladden the heart of the
Chinese maiden whom he condescends to select to be the mother of
his children.</p>

<p>Junks were making slow progress up the river. The tow-path is
here on the left bank, sixty feet above the present level of the
river. Barefooted trackers, often one hundred in a gang, clamber
over the rocks "like a pack of hounds in full cry," each with the
coupling over his shoulder and all singing in chorus, the junk
they are towing often a quarter of a mile astern of them. When a
rapid intervenes they strain like bondmen at the towrope; the
line creaks under the enormous tension but holds fast. On board
the junk, a drum tattoo is beaten and fire-crackers let off, and
a dozen men with long ironshod bamboos sheer the vessel off the
rocks as foot by foot it is drawn past the obstruction. Contrast
with this toilsome slowness the speed of the junk bound
down-stream. Its mast is shipped; its prodigious bow-sweep
projects like a low bowsprit; the after deck is covered as far as
midships with arched mat-roof; coils of bamboo rope are hanging
under the awning; a score or more of boatmen, standing to their
work and singing to keep time, work the yulos, as looking like a
modern whaleback the junk races down the rapids.</p>

<p>Kweichou-fu, 146 miles from Ichang, is one of the largest
cities on the Upper Yangtse. Just before it is the Fenghsiang
Gorge the "Windbox Gorge" where the mountains nave been again
cleft in twain to let pass the river; this is the last of the
great gorges of the Yangtse.</p>

<p>We had left the province of Hupeh. Kueichou is the first
prefectural city that the traveller meets in Szechuen; for that
reason my laoban required me to give him my passport that he
might take it ashore and have it viseed by the magistrate. While
he was away two Customs officials searched my boat for contraband
goods. When he returned, he had to pay a squeeze at the Customs
station. We clawed with our hooked bamboos round the sterns of a
hundred Szechuen junks, and were again arrested at a likin boat,
and more cash passed from my laoban to the officials in charge.
We went on again, when a third time we came face on to a likin
barrier, and a third time my laoban was squeezed. After this we
were permitted to continue our journey. For the rest of the day
whenever the laoban caught my eye he raised three fingers and
with a rueful shake of the head said "Kweichou haikwan (customs)
no good ;" and then he swore, no doubt.</p>

<p>My little boat was the smallest on the river. In sailing it
could hold its own with all but the long ferry boats or tenders
which accompany the larger junks to land the trackers and
towline. These boats carry a huge square sail set vertically from
sheer legs, and are very fast. But in rowing, poling, and
tracking we could beat the river.</p>

<p>Anping was passed--a beautiful country town in a landscape of
red hills and rich green pastures, of groves of bamboo and
cypress, of pretty little farmhouses with overhanging eaves and
picturesque temples in wooded glens.</p>

<p>At Chipatzu there are the remains of a remarkable embankment
built of huge blocks of dressed stone resting upon a noble brow
of natural rock; deep Chinese characters are cut into the stone;
but the glory is departed and there are now only a few straggling
huts where there was once a large city.</p>

<p>The river was now at its lowest and at every point of sand and
shingle, meagre bands of gold puddlers were at work washing for
gold in cradle rockers. To judge, however, from the shabbiness of
their surroundings there was little fear that their gains would
disturb the equilibrium of the world's gold yield.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III. THE CITY OF WANHSIEN, AND THE JOURNEY FROM
WANHSIEN TO CHUNGKING.</h3>

<p>At daylight, on March 1st, we were abreast of the many storied
pagoda, whose lofty position, commanding the approach to the
city, brings good fortune to the city of Wanhsien. A beautiful
country is this--the chocolate soil richly tilled, the sides of
the hills dotted with farmhouses in groves of bamboo and cedar,
with every variety of green in the fields, shot through with
blazing patches of the yellow rape-seed. The current was swift,
the water was shallow where we were tracking, and we were
constantly aground in the shingle; but we rounded the point, and
Wanhsien was before us. This is the half-way city between Ichang
and Chungking. My smart laoban dressed himself in his best to be
ready to go ashore with me; he was jubilant at his skill in
bringing me so quickly. "Sampan number one! goddam!" he said;
and, holding up two hands, he turned down seven fingers to show
that we had come in seven days. Then he pointed to other boats
that we were passing, and counted on his fingers fifteen, whereby
I knew he was demonstrating that, had I gone in any other boat
but his, I should have been fifteen days on the way instead of
seven.</p>

<p>An immense number of junks of all kinds were moored to the
bank, bow on. Many of them were large vessels, with hulls like
that of an Aberdeen clipper. Many carry foreign flags, by which
they are exempt from the Chinese likin duties, so capricious in
their imposition, and pay instead a general five per cent, ad
valorem duty on their cargoes, which is levied by the Imperial
Maritime Customs, and collected either in Chungking or Ichang.
From one to the other, with boat-hooks and paddle, we crept past
the outer wings of their balanced rudders till we reached the
landing place. On the rocks at the landing a bevy of women were
washing, beating their hardy garments with wooden flappers
against the stones; but they ceased their work as the foreign
devil, in his uncouth garb, stepped ashore in their midst.
Wanhsien is not friendly to foreigners in foreign garb. I did not
know this, and went ashore dressed as a European. Never have I
received such a spontaneous welcome as I did in this city; never
do I wish to receive such another. I landed at the mouth of the
small creek which separates the large walled city to the east
from the still larger city beyond the walls to the west. My
laoban was with me. We passed through the washerwomen. Boys and
ragamuffins hanging about the shipping saw me, and ran towards
me, yelling: "<i>Yang kweitze, Yang kweitze</i>" (foreign devil,
foreign devil).</p>

<p>Behind the booths a story-teller had gathered a crowd; in a
moment he was alone and the crowd were following me up the hill,
yelling and howling with a familiarity most offensive to a
sensitive stranger. My sturdy boy wished me to produce my
passport which is the size of an admiral's ensign, but I was not
such a fool as to do so for it had to serve me for many months
yet. With this taunting noisy crowd I had to walk on as if I
enjoyed the demonstration. I stopped once and spoke to the crowd,
and, as I knew no Chinese, I told them in gentle of the very low
opinion their conduct led me to form of the moral relations of
their mothers, and the resignation with which it induced me to
contemplate the hyper-pyretic surroundings of their posthumous
existence; and, borrowing the Chinese imprecation, I ventured to
express the hope that when their souls return again to earth they
may dwell in the bodies of hogs, since they appeared to me the
only habitations meet for them.</p>

<p>But my words were useless. With a smiling face, but rage at my
heart, I led the procession up the creek to a stone bridge where
large numbers left me, only to have their places taken on the
other bank by a still more enthusiastic gathering. I stopped here
a moment in the jostling crowd to look up-stream at that singular
natural bridge, which an enormous mass of stone has formed across
the creek, and I could see the high arched bridge beyond it,
which stretches from bank to bank in one noble span, and is so
high above the water that junks can pass under it in the summer
time when the rains swell this little stream into a broad and
navigable river.</p>

<p>Then we climbed the steep bank into the city and entering by a
dirty narrow street we emerged into the main thoroughfare, the
crowd still following and the shops emptying into the street to
see me. We passed the Mohammedan Mosque, the Roman Catholic
Mission, the City Temple, to a Chinese house where I was slipped
into the court and the door shut, and then into another to find
that I was in the home of the China Inland Mission, and that the
pigtailed celestial receiving me at the steps was Mr. Hope Gill.
It was my clothes I then learnt that had caused the manifestation
in my honour. An hour later, when I came out again into the
street, the crowd was waiting still to see me, but it was
disappointed to see me now dressed like one of themselves. In the
meantime I had resumed my Chinese dress. "Look," the people said,
"at the foreigner; he had on foreign dress, and now he is dressed
in Chinese even to his queue. Look at his queue, it is false." I
took off my hat to scratch my head. "Look," they shouted again,
"at his queue; it is stuck to the inside of his hat." But they
ceased to follow me.</p>

<p>There are three Missionaries in Wanhsien of the China Inland
Mission, one of whom is from Sydney. The mission has been opened
six years, and has been fairly successful, or completely
unsuccessful, according to the point of view of the inquirer.</p>

<p>Mr. Hope Gill, the senior member of the mission, is a most
earnest good man, who works on in his discouraging task with an
enthusiasm and devotion beyond all praise. A Premillennialist, he
preaches without ceasing throughout the city; and his preaching
is earnest and indiscriminate. His method has been sarcastically
likened by the Chinese, in the words of one of their best-known
aphorisms, to the unavailing efforts of a "blind fowl picking at
random after worms." Nearly all the Chinese in Wanhsien have
heard the doctrine described with greater or less
unintelligibility, and it is at their own risk if they still
refuse to be saved.</p>

<p>During the cholera epidemic this brave man never left his
post; he never refused a call to attend the sick and dying, and,
at the risk of his own, saved many lives. And what is his reward?
This work he did, the Chinese say, not from a disinterested love
of his fellows, which was his undoubted motive, but to accumulate
merit for himself in the invisible World beyond the grave.
"Gratitude," says this missionary, and it is the opinion of many,
"is a condition of heart, or of mind, which seems to be incapable
of existence in the bodyof a Chinaman." Yet other missionaries
tell me that no man can possess a livelier sense of gratitude
than a Chinaman, or manifest it with more sincerity. "If our
words are compared to the croaking of the frog, we heed it not,
but freely express the feelings of our heart," are actual words
addressed by a grateful Chinese patient to the first medical
missionary in China. And the Chinaman himself will tell you, says
Smith, "that it does not follow that, because he does not exhibit
gratitude he does not feel it. When the dumb man swallows a tooth
he may not say much about it, but it is all inside."</p>

<p>Since its foundation in 1887, the Inland Mission of Wanhsien
has been conducted with brave perseverance. There are,
unfortunately, no converts, but there are three hopeful
"inquirers," whose conversion would be the more speedy the more
likely they were to obtain employment afterwards. They argue in
this way; they say, to quote the words used by the Rev. G. L.
Mason at the Shanghai Missionary Conference of 1890, "if the
foreign teacher will take care of our bodies, we will do him the
favour to seek the salvation of our souls." This question of the
employment of converts is one of the chief difficulties of the
missionary in China. "The idea (derived from Buddhism) is
universally prevalent in China," says the Rev. C. W. Mateer,
"that everyone who enters any sect should live by it. . . When a
Chinaman becomes a Christian he expects to live by his
Christianity."</p>

<p>One of the three inquirers was shown me; he was described as
the most advanced of the three in knowledge of the doctrine. Now
I do not wish to write unkindly, but I am compelled to say that
this man was a poor, wretched, ragged coolie, who sells the
commonest gritty cakes in a rickety stall round the corner from
the mission, who can neither read nor write, and belongs to a
very humble order of blunted intelligence. The poor fellow is the
father of a little girl of three, an only child, who is both deaf
and dumb. And there is the fear that his fondness for the little
one tempts him to give hope to the missionaries that in him they
are to see the first fruit of their toil, the first in the
district to be saved by their teaching, while he nurses a vague
hope that, when the foreign teachers regard him as adequately
converted, they may be willing to restore speech and hearing to
his poor little offspring. It is a scant harvest.</p>

<p>After a Chinese dinner the mission and I went for a walk into
the country. In the main street we met a troop of beggars, each
with a bowl of rice and garbage and a long stick, with a few
tattered rags hanging round his loins--they were the poorest poor
I had ever seen. They were the beggars of the city, who had just
received their mid-day meal at the "Wanhsien Ragged Homes." There
are three institutions of the kind in the city for the relief of
the destitute; they are entirely supported by charity, and are
said to have an average annual income of 40,000 taels. Wanhsien
is a very rich city, with wealthy merchants and great salt hongs.
The landed gentry and the great junk owners have their town
houses here. The money distributed by the townspeople in private
charity is unusually great even for a Chinese city. Its most
public-spirited citizen is Ch'en, one of the merchant princes of
China whose transactions are confined exclusively to the products
of his own country. Starting life with an income of one hundred
taels, bequeathed him by his father, Ch'en has now agents all
over the empire, and mercantile dealings which are believed to
yield him a clear annual income of a quarter of a million taels.
His probity is a by-word; his benefactions have enriched the
province. That cutting in the face of the cliff in the
Feng-hsiang Gorge near Kueichou-fu, where a pathway for trackers
has been hewn out of the solid rock, was done at his expense, and
is said to have cost one hundred thousand taels. Not only by his
benefactions has Ch'en laid up for himself merit in heaven, but
he has already had his reward in this world. His son presented
himself for the M.A. examination for the Hanlin degree, the
highest academical degree in the Empire. Everyone in China knows
that success in this examination is dependent upon the favour of
Wunchang-te-keun, the god of literature (Taoist) "who from
generation to generation hath sent his miraculous influence down
upon earth"; and, as the god had seen with approbation the good
works done by the father, he gave success to the son. When the
son returned home after his good fortune, he was met beyond the
walls and escorted into the city with royal honours; his success
was a triumph for the city which gave him birth.</p>

<p>A short walk and we were out of the city, following a flagged
path with flights of steps winding up the hill through levelled
terraces rich with every kind of cereal, and with abundance of
poppy. Splendid views of one of the richest agricultural regions
in the world are here unfolded. Away down in the valley is the
palatial family mansion of Pien, one of the wealthiest yeomen in
the province. Beyond you see the commencement of the high road, a
paved causeway eight feet wide, which extends for hundreds of
miles to Chentu, the capital of the province, and takes rank as
the finest work of its kind in the empire. On every hill-top is a
fort. That bolder than the rest commanding the city at a distance
of five miles, is on the "Hill of Heavenly Birth." It was built
says Hobson, during the Taiping Rebellion; it existed, says the
missionary, before the present dynasty; discrepant statements
characteristic of this country of contradictions. But, whether
thirty or two hundred and fifty years old, the fort is now one in
name only, and is at present occupied by a garrison of peaceful
peasantry.</p>

<p>Chinamen that we met asked us politely "if we had eaten our
rice," and "whither were we going." We answered correctly. But
when with equal politeness we asked the wayfarer where he was
going, he jerked his chin towards the horizon and said, "a long
way."</p>

<p>We called at the residence of a rich young Chinese, who had
lately received it in his inheritance, together with 3000 acres
of farmland, which, we were told, yield him an annual income of
70,000 taels. In the absence of the master, who was away in the
country reading with his tutor for the Hanlin degree, we were
received by the caretakers, who showed us the handsome guest
chambers, the splendid gilded tablet, the large courts, and
garden rockeries. A handsome residence is this, solidly built of
wood and masonry, and with the trellis work carved with much
elaboration.</p>

<p>It was late when we returned to the mission, and after dark
when I went on board my little wupan. My boys had not been idle.
They had bought new provisions of excellent quality, and had made
the boat much more comfortable. The three kind missionaries came
down to wish me Godspeed. Brave men! they deserve a kinder
fortune than has been their fate hitherto. We crossed the river
and anchored above the city, ready against an early start in the
morning.</p>

<p>The day after leaving Wanhsien was the first time that we
required any assistance on our journey from another junk; it was
cheerfully given. Our towrope had chafed through, and we were in
a difficulty, attempting to pass a bad rapid among the rocks,
when a large junk was hauled bodily past us, and, seeing our
plight, hooked on to us and towed us with them out of danger. On
this night we anchored under the Sentinel Rock (Shih-pao-chai),
perhaps the most remarkable landmark on the river. From two
hundred to three hundred feet high, and sixty feet wide at the
base, it is a detached rock, cleft vertically from a former
cliff. A nine-storied pagoda has been inset into the
south-eastern face, and temple buildings crown the summit.</p>

<p>It was surprising how well my men lived on board the boat.
They had three good meals a day, always with rice and abundance
of vegetables, and frequently with a little pork. Cooking was
done while we were under way; for the purpose we had two little
earthenware stoves, two pans, and a kettle. All along the river
cabbages and turnips are abundant and cheap. Bumboats, laden to
the rail, waylay the boats en route, and offer an armful of fresh
vegetables for the equivalent in copper cash of three-eighths of
a penny. Other boats peddle firewood, cut short and bound in
little bundles, and sticks of charcoal. Coal is everywhere
abundant, and there are excellent briquettes for sale, made of a
mixture of clay and coal-dust.</p>

<p>All day long now for the rest of our voyage we sailed through
a beautiful country. From the hill tops to the water's edge the
hill-sides are levelled into a succession of terraces; there are
cereals and the universal poppy, pretty hamlets, and thriving
little villages; a river half a mile wide thronged with every
kind of river craft, and back in the distance snow-clad
mountains. There are bamboo sheds at every point, with coils of
bamboo tow-rope, mats, and baskets, and huge Szechuen hats as
wide as an umbrella.</p>

<p>On the morning of March 5th I was awakened by loud screaming
and yelling ahead of us. I squeezed out of my cabin, and saw a
huge junk looming down upon us. In an awkward rapid its tow-line
had parted, and the huge structure tumbling uncontrolled in the
water, was bearing down on us, broadside on. It seemed as if we
should be crushed against the rocks, and we must have been, but
for the marvellous skill with which the sailors on the junk, just
at the critical time, swung their vessel out of danger. They were
yelling with discord, but worked together as one man.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we were at Feng-tu-hsien, a flourishing river
port, one of the principal outlets of the opium traffic of the
Upper Yangtse. Next day we were at Fuchou, the other opium port,
whose trade in opium is greater still than that of Feng-tu-hsien.
It is at the junction of a large tributary--the Kung-t'-an-ho,
which is navigable for large vessels for more than two hundred
miles. Large numbers of the Fuchou junks were moored here, which
differ in construction from all other junks on the river Yangtse
in having their great sterns twisted or wrung a quarter round to
starboard, and in being steered by an immense stern sweep, and
not by the balanced rudder of an ordinary junk.</p>

<p>The following day, after a long day's work, we moored beyond
the town of Chang-show-hsien. Here I paid the laoban 2000 cash,
whereupon he paid his men something on account, and then blandly
suggested a game of cards. He was fast winning back his money,
when I intervened and bade them turn in, as I wished to make an
early start in the morning. The river seemed to get broader,
deeper, and more rapid as we ascended; the trackers, on the
contrary, became thinner, narrower, and more decrepit.</p>

<p>On March 8th, our fourteenth day out, disaster nearly overtook
us when within a day's sail of our destination. Next day we
reached Chungking safely, having done by some days the fastest
journey on record up the Yangtse rapids. My captain and his young
crew had finished the journey within the time agreed upon.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV. THE CITY OF CHUNGKING--THE CHINESE CUSTOMS--THE
FAMOUS MONSIEUR HAAS, AND A FEW WORDS ON THE OPIUM FALLACY.</h3>

<p>After passing through the gorge known as Tung-lo-hsia ten
miles from Chungking, the laoban tried to attract my attention
calling me from my crib and pointing with his chin up the river
repeating "Haikwan one piecee," which I interpreted to mean that
there was an outpost of the customs here in charge of one white
man; and this proved to be the case. The customs kuatze or
houseboat was moored to the left bank; the Imperial Customs flag
floated gaily over an animated collection of native craft. We
drew alongside the junk and an Englishman appeared at the
window.</p>

<p>"Where from?" he asked, laconically.</p>

<p>"Australia."</p>

<p>"The devil, so am I. What part?"</p>

<p>"Victoria."</p>

<p>"So am I. Town?"</p>

<p>"Last from Ballarat."</p>

<p>"My native town, by Jove! Jump up."</p>

<p>I gave him my card. He looked at it and said, "When I was last
in Victoria I used to follow with much interest a curious walk
across Australia, from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Melbourne done
by a namesake. Any relation? The same man! I'm delighted to see
you." Here then at the most inland of the customs stations in
China, 1500 miles from the sea, I met my fellow countryman who
was born near my home and whose father was a well-known Mayor of
Ballarat City.</p>

<p>Like myself he had formerly been a student of Melbourne
University, but I was many years his senior. What was his
experience of the University I forgot to inquire, but mine I
remember vividly enough; for it was not happy. In the examination
for the Second-year Medicine, hoping the more to impress the
Professors, I entered my name for honours--and they rejected me
in the preliminary pass. It seems that in the examination in
Materia Medica, I had among other trifling lapses prescribed a
dose of Oleum Crotonis of "one half to two drachms carefully
increased." I confess that I had never heard of the wretched
stuff; the question was taken from far on in the text book and,
unfortunately, my reading had not extended quite so far. When a
deputation from my family waited upon the examiner to ascertain
the cause of my misadventure, the only satisfaction we got was
the obliging assurance "that you might as well let a mad dog
loose in Collins Street" as allow me to become a doctor. And then
the examiner produced my prescription. But I thought I saw a
faint chance of escape. I pointed a nervous finger to the two
words "carefully increased," and pleaded that that indication of
caution ought to save me. "Save you it might," he shouted with
unnecessary vehemence; "but, God bless my soul, man, it would not
save your patient." The examiner was a man intemperate of speech;
so I left the University. It was a severe blow to the University,
but the University survived it.</p>

<p>My countryman had been five years in China in the customs
service, that marvellous organisation which is more impartially
open to all the world than any other service in the world. As an
example, I note that among the Commissioners of Customs at the
ports of the River Yangtse alone, at the time of my voyage the
Commissioner at Shanghai was an Austrian, at Kiukiang a
Frenchman, at Hankow an Englishman, at Ichang a Scandinavian, and
at Chungking a German.</p>

<p>The Australian had been ten months at Chungking. His up-river
journey occupied thirty-eight days, and was attended with one
moving incident. In the Hsintan rapid the towline parted, and his
junk was smashed to pieces by the rocks, and all that he
possessed destroyed. It was in this rapid that my boat narrowly
escaped disaster, but there was this difference in our
experiences, that at the time of his accident the river was sixty
feet higher than on the occasion of mine.</p>

<p>Tang-chia-to, the customs out-station, is ten miles by river
from Chungking, but not more than four miles by land. So I sent
the boat on, and in the afternoon walked over to the city. A
customs coolie came with me to show me the way. My friend
accompanied me to the river crossing, walking with me through
fields of poppy and sugarcane, and open beds of tobacco. At the
river side he left me to return to his solitary home, while I
crossed the river in a sampan, and then set out over the hills to
Chungking. It was more than ever noticeable, the poor hungry
wretchedness of the river coolies. For three days past all the
trackers I had seen were the most wretched in physique of any I
had met in China. Phthisis and malaria prevail among them; their
work is terribly arduous; they suffer greatly from exposure; they
appear to be starving in the midst of abundance. My coolie showed
well by contrast with the trackers; he was sleek and well fed. A
"chop dollar," as he would be termed down south, for his face was
punched or chopped with the small-pox, he swung along the paved
pathway and up and down the endless stone steps in a way that
made me breathless to follow. We passed a few straggling houses
and wayside shrines and tombstones. All the dogs in the district
recognised that I was a stranger, and yelped consumedly, like the
wolfish mongrels that they are. From a hill we obtained a misty
view of the City of Chungking, surrounded on two sides by river
and covering a broad expanse of hill and highland. I was taken to
the customs pontoon on the south bank of the river, and then up
the steep bank by many steps to the basement of an old temple
where the two customs officers have their pleasant dwelling. I
was kindly received, and stayed the night. We were an immense
height above the water; the great city was across the broad
expanse of river, here more than seven hundred yards in width.
Away down below us, moored close to the bank, and guarded by
three Chinese armed junks or gunboats, was the customs hulk,
where the searching is done, and where the three officers of the
outdoor staff have their offices. There is at present but little
smuggling, because there are no Chinese officials. Smuggling may
be expected to begin in earnest as soon as Chinese officials are
introduced to prevent it. Chinese searchers do best who use their
eyes not to see--best for themselves, that is. The gunboats
guarding this Haikwan Station have a nominal complement of eighty
men, and an actual complement of twenty-four; to avoid, however,
unnecessary explanation, pay is drawn by the commanding officer,
not for the actual twenty-four, but for the nominal eighty.</p>

<p><b>CHUNGKING, FROM THE OPPOSITE BANK OF THE YANGTSE</b></p>
</center>

<p>My two companions in the temple were tidewaiters in the
Customs. There are many storied lives locked away among the
tidewaiters in China. Down the river there is a tidewaiter who
was formerly professor of French in the Imperial University of
St. Petersburg; and here in Chungking, filling the same humble
post, is the godson of a marquis and the nephew of an earl, a
brave soldier whose father is a major-general and his mother an
earl's daughter, and who is first cousin to that enlightened
nobleman and legislator the Earl of C. Few men so young have had
so many and varied experiences as this sturdy Briton. He has
humped his swag in Australia, has earned fifteen shillings a day
there as a blackleg protected by police picquets on a New South
Wales coal mine. He was at Harrow under Dr. Butler, and at Corpus
Christi, Cambridge. He has been in the Dublin Fusiliers, and a
lieutenant in Weatherby's Horse, enlisted in the 5th Lancers, and
rose from private to staff-sergeant, and ten months later would
have had his commission. He served with distinction in the Soudan
and Zululand, and has three medals with four clasps. He was
present at El Teb, and at the disaster at Tamai, when McNeill's
zareeba was broken. He was at Tel-el-kebir; saw Burnaby go forth
to meet a coveted death at Abu-klea, and was present at Abu-Kru
when Sir Herbert Stewart received his death-wound. He was at
Rorke's Drift, and appears with that heroic band in Miss
Elizabeth Thompson's painting. Leaving the army, C. held for a
time a commission in the mounted constabulary of Madras, and now
he is a third class assistant tidewaiter in the Imperial Maritime
Customs of China, with a salary as low as his spirits are
high.</p>

<p>Chungking is an open port, which is not an open port. By the
treaty of Tientsin it is included in the clause which states that
any foreign steamer going to it, a closed port, shall be
confiscated. Yet by the Chefoo Convention, Chungking is to become
an open port as soon as the first foreign steamer shall reach
there. This reminds one of the conflicting instructions once
issued by a certain government in reference to the building of a
new gaol. The instructions were explicit:--</p>

<p>Clause I.--The new gaol shall be constructed out of the
materials of the old.</p>

<p>Clause II.--The prisoners shall remain in the old gaol till
the new gaol is constructed.</p>

<p>In Chungking the Commissioner of Customs is Dr. F. Hirth,
whose Chinese house is on the highest part of Chungking in front
of a temple, which, dimly seen through the mist, is the crowning
feature of the city. A distinguished sinologue is the doctor, one
of the finest Chinese scholars in the Empire, author of "China
and the Roman Orient," "Ancient Porcelain," and an elaborate
"Textbook of Documentary Chinese," which is in the hands of most
of the Customs staff in China, for whose assistance it was
specially written. Dr. Hirth is a German who has been many years
in China. He holds the third button, the transparent blue button,
the third rank in the nine degrees by which Chinese Mandarins are
distinguished.</p>

<p>The best site in Chungking has been fortunately secured by the
Methodist Episcopalian Mission of the United States. Their
missionaries dwell with great comfort in the only foreign-built
houses in the city in a large compound with an ample garden.
Their Mission hospital is a well-equipped Anglo-Chinese building
attached to the city wall, and overlooking from its lofty
elevation the Little River, and the walled city beyond it.</p>

<p>The wards of the hospital are comfortable and well lit; the
floors are varnished; the beds are provided with spring
mattresses; indeed, in the comfort of the hospital the Chinese
find its chief discomfort. A separate compartment has been walled
off for the treatment of opium-smokers who desire by forced
restraint to break off the habit. Three opium-smokers were in
durance at the time of my visit; they were happy and contented
and well nourished, and none but the trained eye of an expert,
who saw what he wished to see, could have guessed that they were
addicted to the use of a drug which has been described in
exaggerated terms as "more deadly to the Chinese than war,
famine, and pestilence combined." (Rev. A. H. Smith, "Chinese
Characteristics," p. 187.)</p>

<p>Not long ago three men were admitted into the hospital
suffering, on their own confession, from the opium habit. They
freely expressed the desire of their hearts to be cured, and were
received with welcome and placed in confinement. Every effort was
made to wean them from the habit which, they alleged, had "seized
them in a death grip." Attentive to the teacher and obedient to
the doctor, they gave every hope of being early admitted into
Church fellowship. But one night the desire to return to the drug
became irresistible, and, strangely, the desire attacked all
three men at the same time on the same night; and they escaped
together. Sadly enough there was in this case marked evidence of
the demoralising influence of opium, for when they escaped they
took with them everything portable that they could lay their
hands on. It was a sad trial.</p>

<p>Excellent medical work is done in the hospital. From the first
annual report just published by the surgeon in charge, an M.D.
from the United States, I extract the two following pleasing
items.</p>

<p>Medical Work.--"Mr Tsang Taotai, of Kuei-Iang-fu, was an eye
witness to several operations, as well as being operated upon for
Internal Piles" (the last words in large capitals).</p>

<p>Evangelistic Work.--"Mrs Wei, in the hospital for suppurating
glands of the neck, became greatly interested in the truth while
there, left a believer, and attends Sunday service regular (sic),
walking from a distant part of the city each Sunday. We regard
her as very hopeful, and she is reported by the Chinese as being
very warm-hearted." She will be converted when the first vacancy
occurs in the nursing staff.</p>

<p>During my stay in Chungking I frequently met the French Consul
"en commission," Monsieur Haas, who had lately arrived on a
diplomatic mission, which was invested with much secrecy. It was
believed to have for its object the diversion of the trade of
Szechuen from its natural channel, the Yangtse River, southward
through Yunnan province to Tonquin. Success need not be feared to
attend his mission. "Us perdront et leur temps et leur argent"
Monsieur Haas has helped to make history in his time. The most
gentle-mannered of men, he writes with strange rancour against
the perfidious designs of Britain in the East. In his diplomatic
career Monsieur Haas suffered one great disappointment. He was
formerly the French Charge d'Affaires and Political Resident at
the court of King Theebaw in Mandalay. And it was his "Secret
Treaty" with the king which forced the hand of England and led to
her hasty occupation of Upper Burma. The story is a very pretty
one. By this treaty French influence was to become predominant in
Upper Burma; the country was to become virtually a colony of
France, with a community of interest with France, with France to
support her in any difficulty with British Burma. Such a position
England could not tolerate for one moment. Fortunately for us
French intrigue outwitted itself, and the Secret Treaty became
known. It was in this way. Draft copies of the agreement drawn up
in French and Burmese were exchanged between Monsieur Haas and
King Theebaw. But Monsieur Haas could not read Burmese, and he
distrusted the King. A trusted interpreter was necessary, and
there was only one man in Mandalay that seemed to him
sufficiently trustworthy. To Signor A------ then, the Italian
Charge d'Affaires and Manager of the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company,
Monsieur Haas went and, pledging him to secrecy, sought his
assistance as interpreter.</p>

<p>As Monsieur Haas had done, so did his Majesty the King. Two
great minds were being guided by the same spirit. Theebaw could
not read French, and he distrusted Monsieur Haas. An interpreter
was essential, and, casting about for a trusted one, he decided
that no one could serve him so faithfully as Signor A------, and
straightway sought his assistance, as Monsieur Haas had done.
Their fates were in his hands; which master should the Italian
serve, the French or the Burmese? He did not hesitate--he
betrayed them both. Within an hour the Secret Treaty was in
possession of the British Resident. Action was taken with
splendid promptitude. "M. de Freycinet, when pressed on the
subject, repudiated any intention of acquiring for France a
political predominance in Burma." An immediate pretext was found
to place Theebaw in a dilemma; eleven days later the British
troops had crossed the frontier, and Upper Burma was another
province of our Indian Empire.</p>

<p>Monsieur Haas was recalled, and his abortive action
repudiated. He had acted, of course, without orders; he had erred
from too much zeal. Signer A------ was also recalled, but did not
go because the order was not accompanied with the customary
cheque to defray the cost of his passage. His services to England
were rewarded, and he retained his engagement as Manager of the
Flotilla Company; but he lost his appointment as the
Representative of Italy--an honourable post with a dignified
salary paid by the Italian Government in I.O.U.'s.</p>

<p>Chungking is an enormously rich city. It is built at the
junction of the Little River and the Yangtse, and is, from its
position, the great river port of the province of Szechuen.
Water-ways stretch from here an immense distance inland. The
Little River is little only in comparison with the Yangtse, and
in any other country would be regarded as a mighty inland river.
It is navigable for more than 2000 li (600 miles). The Yangtse
drains a continent; the Little River drains a province larger
than a European kingdom. Chungking is built at a great height
above the present river, now sixty feet below its summer level.
Its walls are unscalable. Good influences are directed over the
city from a lofty pagoda on the topmost hill in the vicinity.
Temples abound, and spacious yamens and rich buildings, the
crowning edifice of all being the Temple to the God of
Literature. Distances are prodigious in Chungking, and the
streets so steep and hilly, with flights of stairs cut from the
solid rock, that only a mountaineer can live here in comfort. All
who can afford it go in chairs; stands of sedan chairs are at
every important street corner.</p>

<p><b>A TEMPLE THEATRE IN CHUNGKING</b></p>
</center>

<p>During the day the city vibrates with teeming traffic; at
night the streets are deserted and dead, the stillness only
disturbed by a distant watchman springing his bamboo rattle to
keep himself awake and warn robbers of his approach. In no city
in Europe is security to life and property better guarded than in
this, or, indeed, in any other important city in China. It is a
truism to say that no people are more law-abiding than the
Chinese; "they appear," says Medhurst, "to maintain order as if
by common consent, independent of all surveillance."</p>

<p>Our Consul in Chungking is Mr. E. H. Fraser, an accomplished
Chinese scholar, who fills a difficult post with rare tact and
complete success. Consul Fraser estimates the population of
Chungking at 200,000; the Chinese, he says, have a record of
35,000 families within the walls. Of this number from forty to
fifty per cent of all men, and from four to five per cent, of all
women, indulge in the opium pipe. The city abounds in
opium-shops--shops, that is, where the little opium-lamps and the
opium-pipes are stacked in hundreds upon hundreds. Opium is one
of the staple products of this rich province, and one of the
chief sources of wealth of this flourishing city.</p>

<p>During the nine months that I was in China I saw thousands of
opium-smokers, but I never saw one to whom it could be applied
that description by Lay (of the British and Foreign Bible
Society), so often quoted, of the typical opium-smoker in China
"with his lank and shrivelled limbs, tottering gait, sallow
visage, feeble voice, and death-boding glance of eye, proclaiming
him the most forlorn creature that treads upon the ground."</p>

<p>This fantastic description, paraded for years past for our
sympathy, can be only applied to an infinitesimal number of the
millions in China who smoke opium. It is a well-known fact that
should a Chinese suffering from the extreme emaciation of disease
be also in the habit of using the opium-pipe, it is the pipe and
not the disease that in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred will
be wrongly blamed as the cause of the emaciation.</p>

<p>During the year 1893 4275 tons of Indian opium were imported
into China. The Chinese, we are told, plead to us with
"outstretched necks" to cease the great wrong we are doing in
forcing them to buy our opium. "Many a time," says the Rev. Dr.
Hudson Taylor, "have I seen the Chinaman point with his thumb to
Heaven, and say, 'There is Heaven up there! There is Heaven up
there!' What did he mean by that? You may bring this opium to us;
you may force it upon us; we cannot resist you, but there is a
Power up there that will inflict vengeance." (National
Righteousness, Dec. 1892, p. 13.)</p>

<p>But, with all respect to Dr. Hudson Taylor and his ingenious
interpretation of the Chinaman's gesture, it is extremely
difficult for the traveller in China to believe that the Chinese
are sincere in their condemnation of opium and the opium traffic.
"In some countries," says Wingrove Cooke, "words represent facts,
but this is never the case in China." Li Hung Chang, the Viceroy
of Chihli, in the well-known letter that he addressed to the Rev.
F. Storrs Turner, the Secretary of the Society for the
Suppression of the Opium Trade, on May 24th, 1881, a letter still
widely circulated and perennially cited, says, "the poppy is
certainly surreptitiously grown in some parts of China,
notwithstanding the laws and frequent Imperial edicts prohibiting
its cultivation."</p>

<p>Surreptitiously grown in some parts of China! Why, from the
time I left Hupeh till I reached the boundary of Burma, a
distance of 1700 miles, I never remember to have been out of
sight of the poppy. Li Hung Chang continues, "I earnestly hope
that your Society, and all right-minded men of your country, will
support the efforts China is now making to escape from the
thraldom of opium." And yet you are told in China that the
largest growers of the poppy in China are the family of Li Hung
Chang.</p>

<p>The Society for the Suppression of Opium has circulated by
tens of thousands a petition which was forwarded to them from the
Chinese--spontaneously, per favour of the missionaries. "Some
tens of millions," this petition says, "some tens of millions of
human beings in distress are looking on tiptoe with outstretched
necks for salvation to come from you, O just and benevolent men
of England! If not for the good or honour of your country, then
for mercy's sake do this good deed now to save a people, and the
rescued millions shall themselves be your great reward." (China's
Millions, iv., 156.)</p>

<p>Assume, then, that the Chinese do not want our opium, and
unavailingly beseech us to stay this nefarious traffic, which is
as if "the Rivers Phlegethon and Lethe were united in it,
carrying fire and destruction wherever it flows, and leaving a
deadly forgetfulness wherever it has passed." (The Rev. Dr. Wells
Williams. "The Middle Kingdom," i., 288.)</p>

<p>They do not want our opium, but they purchase from us 4275
tons per annum.</p>

<p>Of the eighteen provinces of China four only, Kiangsu,
Cheh-kiang, Fuh-kien, and Kuangtung use Indian opium, the
remaining fourteen provinces use exclusively home-grown opium.
Native-grown opium has entirely driven the imported opium from
the markets of the Yangtse Valley; no Indian opium, except an
insignificant quantity, comes up the river even as far as Hankow.
The Chinese do not want our opium--it competes with their own. In
the three adjoining provinces of Szechuen, Yunnan, and Kweichow
they grow their own opium; but they grow more than they need, and
have a large surplus to export to other parts of the Empire. The
amount of this surplus can be estimated, because all exported
opium has to pay customs and likin dues to the value of two
shillings a pound, and the amount thus collected is known.
Allowing no margin for opium that has evaded customs dues, and
there are no more scientific smugglers than the Chinese, we still
find that during the year 1893 2250 tons of opium were exported
from the province of Szechuen, 1350 tons from Yunnan, and 450
tons from Kweichow, a total of 4050 tons exported by the rescued
millions of three provinces only for the benefit of their
fellow-countrymen, who, with outstretched necks, plead to England
to leave them alone in their monopoly.</p>

<p>Edicts are still issued against the use of opium. They are
drawn up by Chinese philanthropists over a quiet pipe of opium,
signed by opium-smoking officials, whose revenues are derived
from the poppy, and posted near fields of poppy by the
opiurn-smoking magistrates who own them.</p>

<p>In the City Temple of Chungking there is a warning to
opium-eaters. One of the fiercest devils in hell is there
represented gloating over the crushed body of an opium-smoker;
his protruding tongue is smeared with opium put there by the
victim of "<i>yin</i>" (the opium craving), who wishes to
renounce the habit. The opium thus collected is the perquisite of
the Temple priests, and at the gate of the Temple there is a
stall for the sale of opium fittings.</p>

<p>Morphia pills are sold in Chungking by the Chinese chemists to
cure the opium habit. This profitable remedy was introduced by
the foreign chemists of the coast ports and adopted by the
Chinese. Its advantage is that it converts a desire for opium
into a taste for morphia, a mode of treatment analogous to
changing one's stimulant from colonial beer to methylated spirit.
In 1893, 15,000 ounces of hydrochlorate of morphia were admitted
into Shanghai alone.</p>

<p>The China Inland Mission have an important station at
Chungking. It was opened seventeen years ago, in 1877, and is
assisted by a representative of the Horsburgh Mission. The
mission is managed by a charming English gentleman, who has
exchanged all that could make life happy in England for the
wretched discomfort of this malarious city. Every assistance I
needed was given me by this kindly fellow who, like nearly all
the China Inland Mission men, deserves success if he cannot
command it. A more engaging personality I have rarely met, and it
was sad to think that for the past year, 1893, no new convert was
made by his Mission among the Chinese of Chungking. (China's
Millions, January, 1894.) The Mission has been working
short-handed, with only three missionaries instead of six, and
progress has been much delayed in consequence.</p>

<p>The London Missionary Society, who have been here since 1889,
have two missionaries at work, and have gathered nine
communicants and six adherents. Their work is largely aided by an
admirable hospital under Cecil Davenport, F.R.C.S., a countryman
of my own. "Broad Benevolence" are the Chinese characters
displayed over the entrance to the hospital, and they truthfully
describe the work done by the hospital. In the chapel adjoining,
a red screen is drawn down the centre of the church, and
separates the men from the women--one of the chief pretexts that
an Englishman has for going to church is thus denied the
Chinaman, since he cannot cast an ogling eye through a
curtain.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V. THE JOURNEY FROM CHUNGKING TO SUIFU--CHINESE
INNS.</h3>

<p>I left the boat at Chungking and started on my land journey,
going west 230 miles to Suifu. I had with me two coolies to carry
my things, the one who received the higher pay having also to
bring me my food, make my bed, and pay away my copper cash. They
could not speak a single word of English. They were to be paid
for the journey one 4s. 10d. and the other 5s. 7d. They were to
be entitled to no perquisites, were to find themselves on the
way, and take their chance of employment on the return journey.
They were to lead me into Suifu on the seventh day out from
Chungking. All that they undertook to do they did to my complete
satisfaction.</p>

<p>On the morning of March 14th I set out from Chungking to cross
1600 miles over Western China to Burma. Men did not speak
hopefully of my chance of getting through. There were the rains
of June and July to be feared apart from other obstacles.</p>

<p>Pere Lorain, the Procureur of the French Mission, who spoke
from an experience of twenty-five years of China, assured me
that, speaking no Chinese, unarmed, unaccompanied, except by two
poor coolies of the humblest class, and on foot, I would have
<i>les plus grandes difficultes</i>, and Monsieur Haas, the
Consul en commission, was equally pessimistic. The evening before
starting, the Consul and my friend Carruthers (one of the
Inverness Courier Carruthers) gave me a lesson in Chinese.
"French before breakfast" was nothing to this kind of cramming. I
learnt a dozen useful words and phrases, and rehearsed them in
the morning to a member of the Inland Mission, who cheered me by
saying that it would be a clever Chinaman indeed who could
understand Chinese like mine.</p>

<p>I left on foot by the West Gate, being accompanied so far by
A. J. Little, an experienced traveller and authority on China,
manager in Chungking of the Chungking Transport Company (which
deals especially with the transport of cargo from Ichang up the
rapids), whose book on "The Yangtse Gorges" is known to every
reader of books on China.</p>

<p>I was dressed as a Chinese teacher in thickly-wadded Chinese
gown, with pants, stockings, and sandals, with Chinese hat and
pigtail. In my dress I looked a person of weight. I must
acknowledge that my outfit was very poor; but this was not
altogether a disadvantage, for my men would have the less
temptation to levy upon it. Still it would have been awkward if
my men had taken it into their heads to walk off with my things,
because I could not have explained my loss. My chief efforts, I
knew, throughout my journey would be applied in the direction of
inducing the Chinese to treat me with the respect that was
undoubtedly due to one who, in their own words, had done them the
"exalted honour" of visiting "their mean and contemptible
country." For I could not afford a private sedan chair, though I
knew that Baber had written that "no traveller in Western China
who possesses any sense of self-respect should journey without a
sedan chair, not necessarily as a conveyance, but for the honour
and glory of the thing. Unfurnished with this indispensable token
of respectability he is liable to be thrust aside on the highway,
to be kept waiting at ferries, to be relegated to the worst inn's
worst room, and generally to be treated with indignity, or, what
is sometimes worse, with familiarity, as a peddling footpad who,
unable to gain a living in his own country, has come to subsist
on China." ("Travels and Researches in Western China," p. i.)</p>

<p>Six li out (two miles), beyond the gravemounds there is a
small village where ponies are kept for hire. A kind friend came
with me as far as the village to act as my interpreter, and here
he engaged a pony for me. It was to carry me ten miles for
fourpence. It was small, rat-like and wiry, and was steered by
the "mafoo" using the tail like a tiller. Mounted then on this
small beast, which carried me without wincing, I jogged along
over the stone-flagged pathway, down hill and along valley,
scaling and descending the long flights of steps which lead over
the mountains. The bells of the pony jingled merrily; the day was
fine and the sun shone behind the clouds. My two coolies sublet
their contracts, and had their loads borne for a fraction of a
farthing per mile by coolies returning empty-handed to Suifu.</p>

<p><b>ON THE MAIN ROAD TO SUIFU</b></p>
</center>

<p>Fu-to-kuan four miles from Chungking is a powerful hill-fort
that guards the isthmus where the Yangtse and the Little River
come nearly together before encircling Chungking. Set in the face
of the cliff is a gigantic image of Buddha. Massive stone
portals, elaborately carved, and huge commemorative tablets cut
from single blocks of stone and deeply engraved, here adorn the
highway. The archways have been erected by command of the
Emperor, but at the expense of their relatives, to the memory of
virtuous widows who have refused to remarry, or who have
sacrificed their lives on the death of their husbands. Happy are
those whose names are thus recorded, for not only do they obtain
ten thousand merits in heaven, as well as the Imperial
recognition of the Son of Heaven on earth; but as an additional
reward their souls may, on entering the world a second time,
enjoy the indescribable felicity of inhabiting the bodies of
men.</p>

<p>Cases where the widow has thus brought honour to the family
are constantly recorded in the pages of the Peking Gazette. One
of more than usual merit is described in the Peking Gazette of
June loth, 1892. The story runs:--</p>

<p>"The Governor of Shansi narrates the story of a virtuous wife
who destroyed herself after the death of her husband. The lady
was a native of T'ienmen, in Hupeh, and both her father and
grandfather were officials who attained the rank of Taotai. When
she was little more than ten years old her mother fell ill. The
child cut flesh from her body and mixed it with the medicines and
thus cured her parent. The year before last she was married to an
expectant magistrate. Last autumn, just after he had obtained an
appointment, he was taken violently ill. She mixed her flesh with
the medicine but it was in vain, and he died shortly afterwards.
Overcome with grief, and without parents or children to demand
her care, she determined that she would not live. Only waiting
till she had completed the arrangements for her husband's
interment, she swallowed gold and powder of lead. She handed her
trousseau to her relatives to defray her funeral expenses, and
made presents to the younger members of the family and the
servants, after which, draped in her state robes, she sat waiting
her end. The poison began to work and soon all was over. The
memorialist thinks that the case is one which should be recorded
in the erection of a memorial arch, and he asks the Emperor to
grant that honour to the deceased lady." ("Granted.")</p>

<p>Near the base of the rock upon which the hill-fort is built,
and between it and the city, the Methodist Episcopalian Mission
of the U.S.A. commenced in 1886 to build what the Chinese, in
their ignorance, feared was a foreign fort, but what was nothing
more than a mission house in a compound surrounded by a powerful
wall. The indiscreet mystery associated with its erection was the
exciting cause of the anti-foreign riot of July, 1886.</p>

<p>From the fort the pathway led us through a beautiful country.
We met numbers of sedan chairs, borne by two coolies, or three,
according to the importance of the traveller. There were Chinese
gentlemen mounted on ponies or mules; there were strings of
coolies swinging along under prodigious loads of salt and coal,
and huge bales of raw cotton. Buffaloes with slow and painful
steps were ploughing the paddy fields, the water up to their
middles--the primitive plough and share guided by half-naked
Chinamen. Along the road there are inns and tea-houses every mile
or two, for this is one of the most frequented roadways of China.
At one good-sized village my cook signed to me to dismount; the
mafoo and pony were paid off, and I sat down in an inn, and was
served with an excellent dish of rice and minced beef. The inn
was crowded and open to the street. Despite my Chinese dress
anyone could see that I was a foreigner, but I was not far enough
away from Chungking to excite much curiosity. The other diners
treated me with every courtesy; they offered me of their dishes,
and addressed me in Chinese--a compliment which I repaid by
thanking them blandly in English.</p>

<p>Now I went on, on foot, though I had difficulty in keeping
pace with my men. Behind the village we climbed a very steep hill
by interminable steps, and passed under an archway at the summit.
Descending the hill, my cook engaged in a controversy with a thin
lad whom he had hired to carry his load a stage. The dispute
waxed warm, and, while they stopped to argue it out at leisure, I
went on. My cook, engaged through the kind offices of the Inland
Mission, was a man of strong convictions; and in the last I saw
of the dispute he was pulling the unfortunate coolie downhill by
the pigtail. When he overtook me he was alone and smiling
cheerfully, well satisfied with himself for having settled that
little dispute. The road became more level, and we got over the
ground quickly.</p>

<p>Late in the evening I was led into a crowded inn in a large
village, where we were to stay the night. We had come
twenty-seven miles, and had begun well. I was shown into a room
with three straw-covered wooden bedsteads, a rough table, lit by
a lighted taper in a saucer of oil, a rough seat, and the naked
earth floor. Hot water was brought me to wash with and tea to
drink, and my man prepared me an excellent supper. My baggage was
in the corner; it consisted of two light bamboo boxes with
Chinese padlocks, a bamboo hamper, and a roll of bedding covered
with oilcloth. An oilcloth is indispensable to the traveller in
China, for placed next the straw on a Chinese bed it is
impassable to bugs. And during all my journey in China I was
never disturbed in my sleep by. this unpleasant pest. Bugs in
China are sufficiently numerous, but their numbers cannot be
compared with the gregarious hosts that disturb the traveller in
Spain.</p>

<p>My last night in Spain was spent in Cadiz, the most charming
city in the peninsula. I had lost the last boat off to the
steamer, on which I was a passenger; it was late at night, and I
knew of no inn near the landing. At midnight, as I was walking in
the Plaza, called after that revered monarch, Queen Isabel II., I
was spoken to at the door of a fonda, and asked if I wanted a
bedroom. It was the taberna "La Valenciana." I was delighted; it
was the very thing I was looking for, I said. The innkeeper had
just one room unoccupied, and he showed me upstairs into a plain,
homely apartment, which I was pleased to engage for the night.
"Que usted descanse bien" (may you sleep well), said the
landlord, and left me. Keeping the candle burning I tumbled into
bed, for I was very tired, but jumped out almost immediately,
despite my fatigue. I turned down the clothes, and saw the bugs
gathering in the centre from all parts of the bed. I collected a
dozen or two, and put them in a basin of water, and, dressing
myself, went out on the landing and called the landlord.</p>

<p>He came up yawning.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, "do you wish anything?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; but it is impossible, absolutely impossible, for me
to sleep in that bed."</p>

<p>"But why, senor?"</p>

<p>"Because it is full of bugs."</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir, that cannot be, that cannot be; there is not a
bug in the house."</p>

<p>"But I have seen them."</p>

<p>"You must be mistaken; it is impossible that there can be a
bug in the house."</p>

<p>"But I have caught some."</p>

<p>"It makes twenty years that I live in this house, and never
have I seen such a thing."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but will you do me the favour to look at this
basin?"</p>

<p>"Sir, you are right, you are completely right; it is the
weather; every bed in Cadiz is now full of them."</p>

<p>In the morning, and every morning, we were away at daylight,
and walked some miles before breakfast. All the way to Suifu the
road is a paved causeway, 3 feet 6 inches to 6 feet wide, laid
down with dressed flags of stone; and here, at least, it cannot
be alleged, as the Chinese proverb would have it, that their
roads are "good for ten years and bad for ten hundred." There
are, of course, no fences; the main road picks its way through
the cultivated fields; no traveller ever thinks of trespassing
from the roadway, nor did I ever see any question of trespass
between neighbours. In this law-abiding country the peasantry
conspicuously follow the Confucian maxim taught in China four
hundred years before Christ, "Do not unto others what you would
not have others do unto you." Every rood of ground is under
tillage.</p>

<p>Hills are everywhere terraced like the seats of an
amphitheatre, each terrace being irrigated from the one below it
by a small stream of water, drawn up an inclined plain by a
continuous chain bucket, worked with a windlass by either hand or
foot. The poppy is everywhere abundant and well tended; there are
fields of winter wheat, and pink-flowered beans, and beautiful
patches of golden rape seed. Dotted over the landscape are pretty
Szechuen farmhouses in groves of trees. Splendid banyan trees
give grateful shelter to the traveller. Of this country it could
be written as a Chinese traveller wrote of England, "their
fertile hills, adorned with the richest luxuriance, resemble in
the outline of their summits the arched eyebrows of a fair
woman."</p>

<p>The country is well populated, and a continuous stream of
people is moving along the road. Grand memorial arches span the
roadway, many of them notable efforts of monumental skill, with
columns and architraves carved with elephants and deer, and
flowers and peacocks, and the Imperial seven-tailed dragon of
China. Chinese art is seen at its best in this rich province.</p>

<p>I lived, of course, in the common Chinese inn, ate Chinese
food, and was everywhere treated with courtesy and good nature;
but at first I found it trying to be such an object of curiosity;
to have to do all things in unsecluded publicity; to have to push
my way through streets thronged by the curious to see the
foreigner. My meals I ate in the presence of the street before
gaping crowds. When they came too close I told them politely in
English to keep back a little, and they did so if I illustrated
my words by gesture. When I scratched my head and they saw the
spurious pigtail, they smiled; when I flicked the dust off the
table with my pigtail, they laughed hilariously.</p>

<p><b>SCENE IN SZECHUEN</b></p>
</center>

<p>The wayside inns are usually at the side of an arcade of grass
and bamboo stretched above the mainroad. Two or three ponies are
usually waiting here for hire, and expectant coolies are eager to
offer their services. In engaging a pony you make an offer
casually, as if you had no desire in the world of its being
accepted, and then walk on as if you had no intention whatever of
riding for the next month. The mafoo demands more, but will come
down; you stick to your offer, though prepared to increase it; so
demand and offer you exchange with the mafoo till the width of
the village is between you, and your voices are almost out of
hearing, when you come to terms.</p>

<p>Suppose I wanted a chair to give me a rest for a few miles--it
was usually slung under the rafters--Laokwang (my cook)
unobserved by anyone but me pointed to it with his thumb
inquiringly. I nodded assent and apparently nothing more happened
and the conversation, of which I was quite ignorant, continued.
We left together on foot, my man still maintaining a crescendo
conversation with the inn people till well away. When almost out
of hearing he called out something and an answer came faintly
back from the distance. It was his ultimatum as regards price and
its acceptance--they had been bargaining all the time. My man
motioned to me to wait, said the one word "chiaodza" (sedan
chair) and in a few moments the chair of bamboo and wicker came
rapidly down the road carried by two bearers. They put down the
chair before me and bowed to me; I took my seat and was borne
easily and pleasantly along at four miles an hour at a charge of
less than one penny a mile.</p>

<p>My men received nearly 400 cash a day each; but from time to
time they sweated their contract to unemployed coolies and had
their loads carried for so little as sixty cash (one penny
halfpenny), for two-thirds of a day's journey.</p>

<p>At nightfall we always reached some large village or town
where my cook selected the best inn for my resting place, the
best inn in such cases being usually the one which promised him
the largest squeeze. All the towns through which the road passes
swarm with inns, for there is an immense floating population to
provide for. Competition is keen. Touts stand at the doorway of
every inn, who excitedly waylay the traveller and cry the merits
of their houses. At the counter inside the entrance, piles of
pukais (the warm Chinese bedding), are stacked for hire--few of
the travellers carry their own bedding. The inns are sufficiently
comfortable. The bedrooms are in one or two stories and are
arranged round one or more, or a succession of courts. The
cheapness is to be commended. For supper, bed, and light, tea
during the night and tea before starting in the morning, and
various little comforts, such as hot water for washing, the total
charge for the six nights of my journey from Chungking to Suifu
was 840 cash (1<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>.).</p>

<p>Rice was my staple article of diet; eggs, fowls, and
vegetables were also abundant and cheap; but I avoided pork which
is the flesh universally eaten throughout China by all but the
Mohammedans and vegetarians. In case of emergency I had a few
tins of foreign stores with me. I made it a point never to drink
water--I drank tea. No Chinaman ever drinks anything cold. Every
half hour or hour he can reach an inn or teahouse where tea can
be infused for him in a few minutes. The price of a bowl of tea
with a pinch of tea-leaves, rilled and refilled with hot water ad
lib, is two cash--equal to the twentieth part of one penny. Pork
has its weight largely added to by being injected with water, the
point of the syringe being passed into a large vein; this is
usually described as the Chinese method of "watering stock."</p>

<p>On the third day we were at Yuenchuan, sixty-three miles from
Chungking. On the 5th, we passed through Luchow, one of the
richest and most populous cities on the Upper Yangtse, and at
noon next day we again reached the Yangtse at the Temple of the
Goddess of Mercy, two miles down the river from the large town of
Lanchihsien. According to my interpretation of the gesticulations
of Laokwang, we were then forty miles from Suifu, and a beautiful
sunny afternoon before us, in which to easily cover one half the
distance. But I must reckon with my guide. He wished to remain
here; I wished to go on; but as I could not understand his
Chinese explanation, nor advance any protest except in English,
of which he was innocent, I could only look aggrieved and make a
virtue of a necessity. He did, however, convey to me his solemn
assurance that to-morrow (<i>ming tien</i>) he would conduct me
into Suifu before sunset. An elderly Chinaman, who had given us
the advantage of his company at various inns during the last
three days, here entered into the conversation, produced his
watch, and, with his hand over his heart, which, in a Chinaman,
is in the centre of the breast-bone, added his sacred
asseveration to my guide's. So I stayed. We were quite a friendly
party travelling together.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night a light was flashed into our room
and a voice pealed out an alarm that awoke even my two Chinese,
who, always obligingly slept in the same room with me. I had
protested against their doing so, but they mistook my
expostulation for approbation. We rose at once, and came down the
steep bank to a boat that was lying stern to shore showing a
light. I was charmed to get such an early start, and construed
the indications into a ferry boat to take me across the river,
whence we would go by a short route into Suifu. The boat was
loaded with sugar and had a crew of two men and three boys. There
was an awning over the cargo, but most of the space under it was
already occupied by twelve amiable Chinese, among whom were six
promiscuous friends, who had kept with us for several stages, and
had, I imagine, derived some pecuniary advantages from my
company. Yet this was not a ferry boat, but a passenger boat
engaged especially for me to carry me to Suifu before nightfall.
The Chinese passengers had courteously projected their
companionship upon the inarticulate stranger. An elderly
gentleman, with huge goggles and long nails, whose fingers were
stained with opium, was the pacificator of the party, and calmed
the frequent wranglings in which the other eighteen Chinese
engaged with much earnestness.</p>

<p>Well, this boat--a leaky, heavy, old tub that had to be
tracked nearly all the way--carried me the forty miles to Suifu
within contract time. The boatmen on board worked sixteen hours
without any rest except at two hasty meals; the frayed tow-rope
never parted at any rapid, and only once did our boat get
entangled with any other. Towards sundown we were abreast of the
fine pagoda of Suifu, and a little later were at the landing. The
city is on a high, level shelf of land with high hills behind it.
It lies in the angle of bifurcation formed by the Yangtse river
(here known as the "River of Golden Sand"), going west, and the
Min, or Chentu river, going north to Chentu, the capital city of
the province. I landed below the southern wall, and said good-bye
to my companions. Climbing up the bank into the city, I passed by
a busy thoroughfare to the pretty home of the Inland Mission,
where I received a kind welcome from the gentleman and lady who
conduct the mission, and a charming English girl, also in the
mission, who lives with them.</p>

<p><a name="ch-06"></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI. THE CITY OF SUIFU--THE CHINA INLAND MISSION, WITH
SOME GENERAL REMARKS ABOUT MISSIONARIES IN CHINA.</h3>

<p>At Suifu I rested a day in order to engage new coolies to go
with me to Chaotong in Yunnan Province, distant 290 miles.
Neither of my two Chungking men would re-engage to go further.
Yet in Chungking Laokwang the cook had declared that he was
prepared to go with me all the way to Tali-fu. But now he feared
the loneliness of the road to Chaotong. The way, he said, was
mountainous and little trodden, and robbers would see the
smallness of our party and "come down and stab us." I was then
glad that I had not paid him the retaining fee he had asked in
Chungking to take me to Tali.</p>

<p>I called upon the famous Catholic missionaries, the Provicaire
Moutot and Pere Beraud, saw the more important sights and visited
some newly-arrived missionaries of the American Board of
Missions. Four of the Americans were living together. I called
with the Inland missionary at a time when they were at dinner. We
were shown into the drawing-room, where the most conspicuous
ornament was a painted scroll with a well executed drawing of the
poppy in flower, a circumstance which would confirm the belief of
the Chinese who saw it, that the poppy is held in veneration by
foreigners. While we waited we heard the noise of dinner
gradually cease, and then the door opened and one of the single
ladies entered. She was fierce to look at, tall as a grenadier,
with a stride like a camel; she was picking her teeth with a
hairpin. She courteously expressed her regret that she could not
invite us to dinner. "Waal now," she said, looking at us from
under her spectacles, "ahm real sorry I caan't ask you to have
somethin' to eat, but we've just finished, and I guess there
ain't nothin' left."</p>

<p>Fourteen American missionaries were lately imported into Suifu
in one shipment. Most of them are from Chicago. One of their
earliest efforts will be to translate into Chinese Mr. Stead's
"If Christ came to Chicago," in order the better to demonstrate
to the Chinese the lofty standard of morality, virtue, probity,
and honour attained by the Christian community that sent them to
China to enlighten the poor benighted heathen in this land of
darkness.</p>

<p>Szechuen is a Catholic stronghold. There are nominally one
hundred thousand Catholics in the province, representing the
labours of many French missionaries for a period of rather more
than two hundred years. Actually, however, there are only sixty
thousand Chinese in the province who could be called Catholics.
To use the words of the Provicaire, the Chinese are "trop
materialistes" to become Christian, and, as they are all "liars
and robbers," the faith is not easily propagated amongst them.
Rarely have I met two more charming men than these brave
missionaries. French, they told me, I speak with the "vrai accent
parisien," a compliment which I have no doubt is true, though it
conflicts with my experience in Paris, where most of the true
Parisians to whom I spoke in their own language gave me the same
look of intelligence that I observe in the Chinaman when I
address him in English. Pere Moutot has been twenty-three years
in China--six years at the sacred Mount Omi, and seventeen years
in Suifu; Pere Beraud has been twenty-three years in Suifu. They
both speak Chinese to perfection, and have been co-workers with
the bishop in the production of a Mandarin-French dictionary just
published at Sicawei; they dress as Chinese, and live as Chinese
in handsome mission premises built in Chinese style. There is a
pretty chapel in the compound with scrolls and memorial tablets
presented by Chinese Catholics, a school for boys attended by
fifty ragamuffins, a nunnery and girls' school, and a fit
residence for the venerable bishop. When showing me the chapel,
the Provicaire told me of the visit of one of Our Lord's Apostles
to Suifu. He seemed to have no doubt himself of the truth of the
story. Tradition says that St. Thomas came to China, and, if
further proof were wanting, there is the black image of Tamo
worshipped to this day in many of the temples of Szechuen.
Scholars, however, identify this image and its marked Hindoo
features with that of the Buddhist evangelist Tamo, who is known
to have visited China in the sixth century.</p>

<p>In Suifu there is a branch of the China Inland Mission under
an enthusiastic young missionary, who was formerly a French
polisher in Hereford. He is helped by an amiable wife and by a
charming English girl scarcely out of her teens. The missionary's
work has he tells me, been "abundantly blessed,"--he has baptised
six converts in the last three years. A fine type of man is this
missionary, brave and self-reliant, sympathetic and self-denying,
hopeful and self-satisfied. His views as a missionary are
well-defined. I give them in his own words:--"Those Chinese who
have never heard the Gospel will be judged by the Almighty as He
thinks fit"--a contention which does not admit of dispute--"but
those Chinese who have heard the Christian doctrine, and still
steel their hearts against the Holy Ghost, will assuredly go to
hell; there is no help for them, they can believe and they won't;
had they believed, their reward would be eternal; they refuse to
believe and their punishment will be eternal." But the
destruction that awaits the Chinese must be pointed out to them
with becoming gentleness, in accordance with the teaching of the
Rev. S. F. Woodin, of the American Baptist Mission, Foochow, who
says:--"There are occasions when we must speak that awful word
'hell,' but this should always be done in a spirit of earnest
love." (Records of the Shanghai Missionary Conference, 1877, p.
91.) It was a curious study to observe the equanimity with which
this good-natured man contemplates the work he has done in China,
when to obtain six dubious conversions he has on his own
confession sent some thousands of unoffending Chinese en enfer
bouillir eternellement.</p>

<p>But, if the teaching of this good missionary is unwelcome to
the Chinese, and there are hundreds in China who teach as he
does, how infinitely more distasteful must be the teaching of
both the Founder and the Secretary of the Mission which sent him
to China.</p>

<p>"They are God's lost ones who are in China," says Mr. C. L.
Morgan, editor of The Christian, "and God cares for them and
yearns over them." (China's Millions, 1879, p. 94.) "The millions
of Chinese," (who have never heard the Gospel,) says Mr. B.
Broomhall, secretary of the China Inland Mission, and editor of
China's Millions, "where are they going, what is to be their
future? What is to be their condition beyond the grave? Oh,
tremendous question! It is an awful thing to contemplate--but
they perish; that is what God says." ("Evangelisation of the
World," p. 70.) "The heathen are all guilty in God's eyes; as
guilty they perish." (Id., 101.) "Do we believe that these
millions are without hope in the next world? We turn the leaves
of God's Word in vain, for there we find no hope; not only that,
but positive words to the contrary. Yes! we believe it." (Id., p.
199.)</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Hudson Taylor, the distinguished Founder of the
Mission, certainly believes it, and has frequently stated his
belief in public. Ancestral worship is the keystone of the
religion of the Chinese; "the keystone also of China's social
fabric." And "the worship springs," says the Rev. W. A. P Martin,
D.D., LL.D., of the Tung Wen College, Peking, "from some of the
best principles of human nature. The first conception of a life
beyond the grave was, it is thought, suggested by a desire to
commune with deceased parents." ("The Worship of Ancestors--a
plea for toleration.") But Dr. Hudson Taylor condemned bitterly
this plea for toleration. "Ancestral worship," he said (it was at
the Shanghai Missionary Conference of May, 1890), "Ancestral
worship is idolatry from beginning to end, the whole of it, and
everything connected with it." China's religion is idolatry, the
Chinese are universally idolatrous, and the fate that befalls
idolaters is carefully pointed out by Dr. Taylor:-- "Their part
is in the lake of fire."</p>

<p>"These millions of China," I quote again from Dr. Taylor,
"These millions of China" (who have never heard the Gospel), "are
unsaved. Oh! my dear friends, may I say one word about that
condition? The Bible says of the heathen, that they are without
hope; will you say there is good hope for them of whom the Word
of God says, 'they are without hope, without God in the world'?"
(Missionary Conference of 1888, Records, i., 176.)</p>

<p>"There are those who know more about the state of the heathen
than did the Apostle Paul, who wrote under the inspiration of the
Holy Ghost, 'They that sin without law, perish without law,' nay,
there are those who are not afraid to contradict the revelation
of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto Him to shew unto His
servants, in which He solemnly affirms that 'idolaters and all
liars, their part shall be in the lake that burneth with fire and
brimstone.' Such being the state of the unsaved of China, do not
their urgent needs claim from us that with agonising eagerness we
should hasten to proclaim everywhere the message through which
alone deliverance can be found?" (Ut supra, ii., 31.)</p>

<p>Look then at the enormous difficulty which the six hundred and
eleven missionaries, of the China Inland Mission, raise up
against themselves, the majority of whom are presumably in
agreement with the teaching of their director, Dr. Hudson Taylor.
They tell the Chinese inquirer that his unconverted father, who
never heard the Gospel, has, like Confucius, perished eternally.
But the chief of all virtues in China is filial piety; the
strongest emotion that can move the heart of a Chinaman is the
supreme desire to follow in the footsteps of his father.
Conversion with him means not only eternal separation from the
father who gave him life, but the "immediate liberation of his
ancestors to a life of beggary, to inflict sickness and all
manner of evil on the neighbourhood."</p>

<p>I believe that it is now universally recognised that the most
difficult of all missionary fields--incomparably the most
difficult--is China. Difficulties assail the missionary at every
step; and every honest man, whether his views be broad or high or
low, must sympathise with the earnest efforts the missionaries
are making for the good and advancement of the Chinese.</p>

<p>Look for example at the difficulty there is in telling a
Chinese, who has been taught to regard the love of his parents as
his chief duty, as his forefathers have been taught for hundreds
of generations before him--the difficulty there is in explaining
to him, in his own language, the words of Christ, "If any man
come to Me and hate not his father, he cannot be My disciple. For
I am come to set a man at variance against his father."</p>

<p>In the patriarchal system of government which prevails in
China, the most awful crime that a son can commit, is to kill his
parent, either father or mother. And this is said to be though
the description is no doubt abundantly exaggerated, the
punishment of his crime. He is put to death by the "ling-chi" or
"degrading and slow process," and his younger brothers are
beheaded; his house is razed to the ground and the earth under it
dug up several feet deep; his neighbours are severely punished;
his principal teacher is decapitated; the district magistrate is
deprived of his office; and the higher officials of the province
degraded three degrees in rank.</p>

<p>Such is the enormity of the crime of parricide in China; yet
it is to the Chinese who approves of the severity of this
punishment that the missionary has to preach, "And the children
shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to
death."</p>

<p>The China Inland Mission, as a body of courageous workers,
brave travellers, unselfish and kindly men endowed with every
manly virtue that can command our admiration, is worthy of all
the praise that can be bestowed on it. Most of its members are
men who have been saved after reaching maturity, and
delicately-nurtured emotional girls with heightened religious
feelings.</p>

<p>Too often entirely ignorant of the history of China, a mighty
nation which has "witnessed the rise to glory and the decay of
Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, Persia, Greece, and Rome, and still
remains the only monument of ages long bygone," of its manners
and polity, customs and religions, and of the extraordinary
difficulties in the acquirement of its language, too often
forgetful that the Chinese are a people whose "prepossessions and
prejudices and cherished judgments are the growth of
millenniums," they come to China hoping that miraculous
assistance will aid them in their exposition of the Christian
doctrine, in language which is too often impenetrable darkness to
its hearers.</p>

<p>"They are God's lost ones who are in China, and God cares for
them and yearns over them," and men who were in England
respectable artisans, with an imperfect hold of their own
language, come to China, in response to the "wail of the dying
millions," to stay this "awful ruin of souls," who, at the rate
of 33,000 a day, are "perishing without hope, having sinned
without law."</p>

<p>Six months after their arrival they write to China's Millions:
"Now for the news! Glorious news this time! Our services crowded!
Such bright intelligent faces! So eager to hear the good news!
They seemed to drink in every word, and to listen as if they were
afraid that a word might be lost." Five years later they write:
"The first convert in Siao Wong Miao was a young man named
Sengleping, a mat-seller. He was very earnest in his efforts to
spread the Gospel, but about the beginning of the year he became
insane. The poor man lost his reason, but not his piety."
(China's Millions, iv., 5, 95, and 143).</p>

<p>A young English girl at this mission, who has been more than a
year in China, tells me that she has never felt the Lord so near
her as she has since she came to China, nor ever realised so
entirely His abundant goodness. Poor thing, it made me sad to
talk to her. In England she lived in a bright and happy home with
brothers and sisters, in a charming climate. She was always well
and full of life and vigour, surrounded by all that can make life
worth living. In China she is never well; she is almost
forgetting what is the sensation of health; she is anaemic and
apprehensive; she has nervous headaches and neuralgia; she can
have no pleasure, no amusement whatever; her only relaxation is
taking her temperature; her only diversion a prayer meeting. She
is cooped up in a Chinese house in the unchanging society of a
married couple--the only exercise she can permit herself is a
prison-like walk along the top of the city at the back of the
mission. Her lover, a refined English gentleman who is also in
the mission, lives a week's journey away, in Chungking, a
depressing fever-stricken city where the sun is never seen from
November to June, and blazes with unendurable fierceness from
July to October. In England he was full of strength and vigour,
fond of boating and a good lawn-tennis player. In China he is
always ill, anaemic, wasted, and dyspeptic, constantly subject to
low forms of fever, and destitute of appetite. But more agonising
than his bad health is the horrible reality of the unavailing
sacrifice he is making--no converts but "outcasts subsidised to
forsake their family altars"; no reward but the ultimate one
which his noble self-devotion is laying up for himself in Heaven.
No man with a healthy brain can discern "Blessing" in the work of
these two missionaries, nor be blind to the fact that it is the
reverse of worshipful to return effusive thanks to the great
Almighty, "who yearns over the Chinese, His lost ones," for
"vouchsafing the abundant mercies" of a harvest of six doubtful
converts as the work of three missionaries for three years.</p>

<p>There are 180,000 people in Suifu, and, as is the case with
Chinese cities, a larger area than that under habitation is
occupied by the public graveyard outside the city, which covers
the hill slopes for miles and miles. The number of opium-smokers
is so large that the question is not, who does smoke opium, but
who doesn't. In the mission street alone, besides the Inland
Mission, the Buddhist Temple, Mohammedan Mosque, and Roman
Catholic Mission, there are eight opium-houses. Every bank, silk
shop, and hong, of any pretension whatever, throughout the city,
has its opium-room, with the lamp always lit ready for the guest.
Opium-rooms are as common as smoking rooms are with us. A whiff
of opium rather than a nip of whisky is the preliminary to
business in Western China.</p>

<p>An immensely rich city is Suifu with every advantage of
position, on a great waterway in the heart of a district rich in
coal and minerals and inexhaustible subterranean reservoirs of
brine. Silks and furs and silverwork, medicines, opium and
whitewax, are the chief articles of export, and as, fortunately
for us, Western China can grow but little cotton, the most
important imports are Manchester goods.</p>

<p><b>OPIUM-SMOKING</b></p>
</center>

<p>Szechuen is by far the richest province of the eighteen that
constitute the Middle Kingdom. Its present Viceroy, Liu, is a
native of Anhwei; he is, therefore, a countryman of Li Hung Chang
to whom he is related by marriage, his daughter having married Li
Hung Chang's nephew. Its provincial Treasurer is believed to
occupy the richest post held by any official in the empire. It is
worth noticing that the present provincial Treasurer, Kung
Chao-yuan, has just been made (1894) Minister Plenipotentiary to
Great Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Sweden and Norway, and one
can well believe how intense was his chagrin when he received
this appointment from the "Imperial Supreme" compelling him, as
it did, to forsake the tombs of his ancestors--to leave China for
England on a fixed salary, and vacate the most coveted post in
the empire, a post where the opportunities of personal enrichment
are simply illimitable.</p>

<p>In Suifu there are two magistrates, both with important
yamens. The Fu magistrate is the "Father of the City," the Hsien
magistrate is the "Mother of the City;" and the "Mother of the
City" largely favours the export opium trade. When Protestant
missionaries first came to the city in 1888 and 1889 there was
little friendliness shown to them. Folk would cry after the
missionary, "There goes the foreigner that eats children," and
children would be hurriedly hidden, as if from fear. These taunts
were at first disregarded. But there came a time when living
children were brought to the mission for sale as food; whereupon
the mission made formal complaint in the yamen, and the Fu at
once issued a proclamation checking the absurd tales about the
foreigners, and ordering the citizens, under many pains and
penalties, to treat the foreigners with respect. There has been
no trouble since, and, as we walked through the crowded streets,
I could see nothing but friendly indifference. Reference to this
and other sorrows is made in the missionary's report to China's
Millions, November, 1893:--</p>

<p>"Soon after this trial had passed away (the rumours of baby
eating), still more painful internal sorrow arose. One of the
members, who had been baptised three years before and had been
useful as a preacher of the Gospel, fell into grievous sin, and
had to be excluded from Church fellowship. Then a little later a
very promising inquirer, who had been cured of opium-smoking and
appeared to be growing in grace, fell again under its power.
While still under a cloud he was suddenly removed during the
cholera visitation."</p>

<p>The China Inland Mission has pleasant quarters close under the
city wall. Their pretty chapel opens into the street, and
displays prominently the proclamation of the Emperor concerning
the treaty rights of foreign missionaries. Seven children, all of
whom are girls, are boarded on the premises, and are being
brought up as Christians. They are pretty, bright children, the
eldest, a girl of fourteen, particularly so. All are
large-footed, and they are to be married to Christian converts.
When this fact becomes known it is hoped that more young Chinamen
than at present may be emulous to be converted. All seven are
foundlings from Chungking where, wrapped in brown paper, they
were at different times dropped over the wall into the Mission
compound. They have been carefully reared by the Mission.</p>

<p>At the boys' school fifty smart boys, all heathens, were at
their lessons. They were learning different subjects, and were
teaching their ears the "tones" by reading at the top of their
voices. The noise was awful. None but a Chinese boy could study
in such a din. In China, when the lesson is finished, the class
is silent; noise, therefore, is the indication of work in a
Chinese school--not silence.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster was a ragged-looking loafer, dressed in grey.
He was in mourning, and had been unshaven for forty-two days in
consequence of the death of his father. This was an important day
of mourning, because on this day, the forty-second after his
death, his dead father became, for the first time, aware of his
own decease. A week later, on the forty-ninth day, the funeral
rites would cease.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII. SUIFU TO CHAOTONG; WITH SOME REMARKS ON THE
PROVINCE OF YUNNAN--CHINESE PORTERS, POSTAL ARRANGEMENTS, AND
BANKS.</h3>

<p>I engaged three new men in Suifu, who undertook to take me to
Chaotong, 290 miles, in thirteen days, special inducement being
held out to them in the shape of a reward of one shilling each to
do the journey in eleven days. Their pay was to be seven
shillings and threepence each, apart from the bonus, and of
course they had to find themselves. They brought me from the
coolie-hong, where they were engaged, an agreement signed by the
hong-master, which was to be returned to them in Chaotong, and
remitted to their master as a receipt for my safe delivery.</p>

<p>Every condition detailed in the agreement they faithfully
carried out, and they took me to Chaotong in ten days and a half,
though the ordinary time is fourteen days.</p>

<p>One of the three was a convert, one of the six surviving
converts made by the aggregate Inland Mission of Suifu in six
years. He was an excellent good fellow, rather dull of wits, but
a credit to the Mission. To him was intrusted the paying away of
my money--he carried no load. When he wanted money he was to show
me his empty hands, and say "Muta tsien! muta tsien!" (I have no
money! I have no money!).</p>

<p>I knew that perfect confidence could be placed in the convert,
apart from the reason of his conversion, because he had a father
living in Suifu. Were he to rob me or do me a wrong and run away,
we could arrest his father and have him detained in the yamen
prison till his son returned. Nothing in China gives one greater
protection against fraud and injury than the law which holds a
father responsible for the wrongdoing of his son, or, where there
is no father, an elder son culpable for the misdeed of the
younger.</p>

<p>On the morning of March 22nd we started for Chaotong in Yunnan
province. The Inland Missionary and a Brother from the American
Baptist Mission kindly came with me for the first thirteen miles.
My route lay west on the north bank of the Yangtse, but later,
after crossing the Yangtse, would be nearly south to
Chaotong.</p>

<p>Shortly before leaving, the chairen or yamen-runner--the
policeman, that is to say--sent by the Magistrate to shadow me to
Takwan-hsien, called at the Mission to request that the
interpreter would kindly remind the traveller, who did not speak
Chinese, that it was customary to give wine-money to the chairen
at the end of the journey. The request was reasonable. All the
way from Chungking I had been accompanied by yamen-runners
without knowing it. The chairen is sent partly for the protection
of the traveller, but mainly for the protection of the
Magistrate; for, should a traveller provided with a passport
receive any injury, the Magistrate of the district would be
liable to degradation. It was arranged, therefore, with the
convert that, on our arrival in Takwan-hsien, I was to give the
chairen, if satisfied with his services, 200 cash (five pence);
but, if he said "gowshun! gowshun!" (a little more! a little more
!) with sufficient persistence, I was to increase the reward
gradually to sevenpence half-penny. This was to be the limit; and
the chairen, I was assured, would consider this a generous return
for accompanying me 227 miles over one of the most mountainous
roads in China.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant walk along the river-bank in the fertile
alluvial, where the poppy in white flower and tobacco were
growing, and where fields of yellow rape-seed, alternated with
beds of rushes--the rape-seed yielding the oil, and the rushes
the rushlights of Chinese lamps. Flocks of wild geese were within
easy shot on the sandbanks--the "peaceful geese," whose virtues
are extolled by every Chinaman. They live in pairs, and, if one
dies, its mate will be for ever faithful to its memory. Such
virtue is worthy of being recorded on the arch which here spans
the roadway, whose Chinese characters, Shen (holy), Chi (will),
show that it was erected by the holy decree of the Emperor to
perpetuate the memory of some widow who never remarried.</p>

<p>As we walked along the missionary gave instructions to my men.
"In my grace I had given them very light loads; hurry and they
would be richly rewarded "--one shilling extra for doing fourteen
stages in eleven days.</p>

<p>At an inn, under the branches of a banyan tree, we sat down
and had a cup of tea. While we waited, a hawker came and sat near
us. He was peddling live cats. In one of his two baskets was a
cat that bore a curious resemblance to a tortoise-shell tabby,
that till a week ago had been a pet in the Inland Mission. It had
disappeared mysteriously; it had died, the Chinese servant said;
and here it was reincarnated.</p>

<p>At the market town the missionaries left me to go on alone
with my three men. I had seventeen miles still to go before
night.</p>

<p>It was midday, and the sun was hot, so a chair was arranged
for to take me the seventeen miles to Anpien. It was to cost 320
cash (eightpence), but, just before leaving, the grasping coolies
refused to carry me for less than 340 cash. "Walk on," said the
missionary, "and teach them a Christian lesson," so I walked
seventeen miles in the sun to rebuke them for their avarice and
save one halfpenny. In the evening I am afraid that I was hardly
in the frame of mind requisite for conducting an evangelical
meeting.</p>

<p>Anpien is a considerable town. It is on the Yangtse River just
below where it bifurcates into two rivers, one of which goes
north-west, the other south-west. Streets of temporary houses are
built down by the river; they form the winter suburb, and
disappear in the summer when the river rises in consequence of
the melting of the snows in its mountain sources. At an excellent
inn, with a noisy restaurant on the first floor, good
accommodation was given me. No sooner was I seated than a chairen
came from the yamen to ask for my Chinese visiting card; but he
did not ask for my passport, though I had brought with me
twenty-five copies besides the original.</p>

<p>At daybreak a chair was ready, and I was carried to the River,
where a ferry boat was in waiting to take us across below the
junction. Then we started on our journey towards the south, along
the right bank of the Laowatan branch of the Yangtse. The road
was a tracking path cut into the face of the cliff; it was
narrow, steep, winding, and slippery. There was only just room
for the chair to pass, and at the sudden turns it had often to be
canted to one side to permit of its passage. We were high above
the river in the mountain gorges. The comfort of the traveller in
a chair along this road depends entirely upon the sureness of
foot of his two bearers--a false step, and chair and traveller
would tumble down the cliff into the foaming river below. Deep
and narrow was the mountain river, and it roared like a cataract,
yet down the passage a long narrow junk, swarming with
passengers, was racing, its oars and bow-sweep worked by a score
of sailors singing in chorus. The boat appeared, passed down the
reach, and was out of sight in a moment; a single error, the
slightest confusion, and it would have been smashed in fragments
on the rocks and the river strewn with corpses.</p>

<p>We did a good stage before breakfast. Every few li where the
steepness of the valley side permits it, there are
straw-thatched, bamboo and plaster inns. Here rice is kept in
wooden bins all ready steaming hot for the use of travellers;
good tea is brewed in a few minutes; the tables and chopsticks
are sufficiently clean.</p>

<p>Leaving the river, we crossed over the mountains by a short
cut to the river again, and at a wayside inn, much frequented by
Chinese, the chair stage finished. I wished to do some writing,
and sat down at one of the tables. A crowd gathered round me, and
were much interested. One elderly Chinese with huge glasses, a
wag in his own way, seeing that I did not speak Chinese, thought
to make me understand and divert the crowd by the loudness of his
speech, and, insisting that I was deaf, yelled into my ears in
tones that shook the tympanum. I told the foolish fellow, in
English, that the less he talked the better I could understand
him; but he persisted, and poked his face almost into mine, but
withdrew it and hobbled off in umbrage when I drew the attention
of the bystanders to the absurd capacity of his mouth, 'which was
larger than any mule's.</p>

<p>I must admit that my knowledge of Chinese was very scanty, so
scanty indeed as to be almost non-existent. What few words I knew
were rarely intelligible; but, as Mrs. General Baynes, when
staying at Boulogne, found Hindostanee to be of great help in
speaking French, so did I discover that English was of great
assistance to me in conversing in Chinese. Remonstrance was thus
made much more effective. Whenever I was in a difficulty, or the
crowd too obtrusive, I had only to say a few grave sentences in
English, and I was master of the situation. This method of
speaking often reminded me of that employed by a Cornish lady of
high family whose husband was a colleague of mine in Spain. She
had been many years in Andalusia, but had never succeeded in
mastering Spanish. At a dinner party given by this lady, at which
I was present, she thus addressed her Spanish servant, who did
not "possess" a single word of English: "Bring me," she said in
an angry aside, "bring me the cuchillo with the black-handled
heft," adding, as she turned to us and thumped her fist on the
table, while the servant stood still mystified, "D------ the
language! I wish I had never learnt it."</p>

<p>The inn, where the sedan left me, was built over the pathway,
which was here a narrow track, two feet six inches wide. Mountain
coolies on the road were passing in single file through the inn,
their backs bending under their huge burdens. Pigs and fowls and
dogs, and a stray cat, were foraging for crumbs under the table.
Through the open doorways you saw the paddy-fields under water
and the terraced hills, with every arable yard under cultivation.
The air was hot and enervating. "The country of the clouds," as
the Chinese term the province of Szechuen, does not belie its
name. An elderly woman was in charge of the oven, and toddled
about on her deformed feet as if she were walking on her heels.
Her husband, the innkeeper, brought us hot water every few
minutes to keep our tea basins full. "No. kaishuilai" (bring hot
water), you heard on all sides. A heap of bedding was in one
corner of the room, in another were a number of rolls of straw
mattresses; a hollow joint of bamboo was filled with chopsticks
for the common use; into another bamboo the innkeeper slipped his
takings of copper cash. Hanging from the rafters were strings of
straw sandals for the poor, and hemp sandals for moneyed
wayfarers like the writer. The people who stood round, and those
seated at the tables, were friendly and respectful, and plied my
men with questions concerning their master. And I did hope that
the convert was not tempted to backslide and swerve from the
truth in his answers.</p>

<p>My men were now anxious to push on. Over a mountainous country
of surpassing beauty, I continued my journey on foot to
Fan-yien-tsen, and rested there for the night, having done two
days' journey in one.</p>

<p>On March 24th we were all day toiling over the mountains,
climbing and descending wooded steeps, through groves of pine,
with an ever-changing landscape before us, beautiful with running
water, with cascades and waterfalls tumbling down into the river,
with magnificent glens and gorges, and picturesque temples on the
mountain tops. At night we were at the village of Tanto, on the
river, having crossed, a few li before, over the boundary which
separates the province of Szechuen from the province of
Yunnan.</p>

<p>From Tanto the path up the gorges leads across a rocky
mountain creek in a defile of the mountains. In England this
creek would be spanned by a bridge; but the poor heathen, in
China, how do they find their way across the stream? By a bridge
also. They have spanned the torrent with a powerful iron
suspension bridge, 100 feet long by ten feet broad, swung between
two massive buttresses and approached under handsome
temple-archways.</p>

<p>Mists clothe the mountains--the air is confined between these
walls of rock and stone. Population is scanty, but there is
cultivation wherever possible. Villages sparsely distributed
along the mountain path have water trained to them in bamboo
conduits from tarns on the hillside. Each house has its own
supply, and there is no attempt to provide for the common good.
Besides other reasons, it would interfere with the trade of the
water-carriers, who all day long are toiling up from the
river.</p>

<p>The mountain slope does not permit a greater width of building
space than on each side of the one main street. And on market
days this street is almost impassable, being thronged with
traffickers, and blocked with stalls and wares. Coal is for sale,
both pure and mixed with clay in briquettes, and salt in blocks
almost as black as coal, and three times as heavy, and piles of
drugs--a medley of bones, horns, roots, leaves, and minerals--and
raw cotton and cotton yarn from Wuchang and Bombay, and finished
goods from Manchester. At one of the villages there was a chair
for hire, and, knowing how difficult was the country, I was
willing to pay the amount asked--namely, 7<i>d</i>. for nearly
seven miles; but my friend the convert, who arranged these
things, considered that between the 5<i>d</i>. he offered and the
7<i>d</i>. they asked the discrepancy was too great, and after
some acrimonious bargaining it was decided that I should continue
on foot, my man indicating to me by gestures, in a most sarcastic
way, that the "chiaodza"' men had failed to overreach him.</p>

<p><b>LAOWATAN</b></p>
</center>

<p>At Sengki-ping it rained all through the night, and I had to
sleep under my umbrella because of a solution in the continuity
of the roof immediately above my pillow. And it rained all the
day following; but my men, eager to earn their reward of one
shilling, pushed on through the slush. It was hard work following
the slippery path above the river. Few rivers in the world flow
between more majestic banks than these, towering as they do a
thousand feet above the water. Clad with thick mountain scrub,
that has firm foothold, the mountains offer but a poor harvest to
the peasant; yet even here, high up on the precipitous sides of
the cliffs, ledges that seem inaccessible are sown with wheat or
peas, and, if the soil be deep enough, with the baneful poppy. As
we plodded on through the mud and rain, we overtook a poor lad
painfully limping along with the help of a stick. He was a bright
lad, who unbound his leg and showed me a large swelling above the
knee. He spoke to me, though I did not understand him, but with
sturdy independence did not ask for alms, and when I had seen his
leg he bound it up again and limped on. Meeting him a little
later at an inn, where he was sitting at table with nothing
before him to eat, I gave him a handful of cash which I had put
in my pocket for him. He thanked me by raising his clasped hands,
and said something, I knew not what, as I hurried on. A little
while afterwards I stopped to have my breakfast, when the boy
passed. As soon as he saw me he fell down upon his knees and
"kotow'd" to me, with every mark of the liveliest gratitude. I
felt touched by the poor fellow's gratitude--he could not have
been more than fifteen--and mean, to think that the benefaction,
which in his eyes appeared so generous, was little more than one
penny. There can be no doubt that I gained merit by this action,
for this very afternoon as I was on the track a large stone the
size of a shell from a 50-ton gun fell from the crag above me,
struck the rock within two paces of me, and shot past into the
river. A few feet nearer and it would have blotted out the life
of one whom the profession could ill spare. We camped at
Laowatan.</p>

<p>A chair with three bearers was waiting for me in the morning,
so that I left the town of Laowatan in a manner befitting my
rank. The town had risen to see me leave, and I went down the
street amid serried ranks of spectators. We crossed the river by
a wonderful suspension bridge, 250 feet long and 12 feet broad,
formed of linked bars of wrought iron. It shows stability,
strength, and delicacy of design, and is a remarkable work to
have been done by the untutored barbarians of this land of night.
We ascended the steep incline opposite, and passed the likin
barrier, but at a turn in the road, higher still in the mountain,
a woman emerged from her cottage and blocked our path. Nor could
the chair pass till my foremost bearer had reluctantly given her
a string of cash. "With money you can move the gods," say the
Chinese; "without it you can't move a man."</p>

<p>For miles we mounted upwards. We were now in Yunnan, "south of
the clouds"--in Szechuen we were always under the clouds--the sun
was warm, the air dry and crisp. Ponies passed us in long droves;
often there were eighty ponies in a single drove. All were
heavily laden with copper and lead, were nozzled to keep them off
the grass, and picked their way down the rocky path of steps with
the agility and sureness of foot of mountain goats. Time was
beaten for them on musical gongs, and the echoes rang among the
mountains. Many were decorated with red flags and tufts, and with
plumes of the Amherst pheasant. These were official pack animals,
which were franked through the likin barriers without
examination.</p>

<p>The path, rising to the height of the watershed, where at a
great elevation we gain a distant view of water, descends by the
counterslope once more to the river Laowatan. A wonderful ravine,
a mountain riven perpendicularly in twain, here gives passage to
the river, and in full view of this we rested at the little town
of Taoshakwan, with the roar of the river hundreds of feet below
us. Midway up the face of the precipice opposite there is a sight
worth seeing; a mass of coffin boards, caught in a fault in the
precipice have been lying there for untold generations, having
been originally carried there by the "ancient flying-men who are
now extinct."</p>

<p>A poor little town is Taoshakwan, with a poor little yamen
with pretentious tigers painted on its outflanking wall, with a
poor little temple, and gods in sad disrepair; but with an
admirable inn, with a charming verandah facing a scene of alpine
magnificence.</p>

<p>We were entering a district of great poverty. At Tchih-li-pu,
where we arrived at midday the next day, the houses are poor, the
people poverty-stricken and ill-clad, the hotel dirty, and my
room the worst I had yet slept in. The road is a well-worn path
flagged in places, uneven, and irregular, following at varying
heights the upward course of the tortuous river. The country is
bald; it is grand but lonely; vegetation is scanty and houses are
few; we have left the prosperity of Szechuen, and are in the
midst of the poverty of Yunnan. Farmhouses there are at rare
intervals, amid occasional patches of cultivation; there are
square white-washed watch towers in groves of sacred trees; there
are a few tombstones, and an occasional rudely carved god to
guard the way. There are poor mud and bamboo inns with grass
roofs, and dirty tables set out with half a dozen bowls of tea,
and with ovens for the use of travellers. Food we had now to
bring with us, and only at the larger towns where the stages
terminate could we expect to find food for sale. The tea is
inferior, and we had to be content with maize meal, bean curds,
rice roasted in sugar, and sweet gelatinous cakes made from the
waste of maize meal. Rice can only be bought in the large towns.
It is not kept in roadside inns ready steaming hot for use, as it
is in Szechuen. Rarely there are sweet potatoes; there are eggs,
however, in abundance, one hundred for a shilling (500 cash), but
the coolies cannot eat them because of their dear-ness. A large
bowl of rice costs four cash, an egg five cash, and the Chinaman
strikes a balance in his mind and sees more nourishment in one
bowl of rice than in three eggs. Of meat there is pork--pork in
plenty, and pork only. Pigs and dogs are the scavengers of China.
None of the carnivora are more omnivorous than the Chinese. "A
Chinaman has the most unscrupulous stomach in the world," says
Meadows; "he will eat anything from the root to the leaf, and
from the hide to the entrails." He will not even despise the
flesh of dog that has died a natural death. During the awful
famine in Shansi of 1876-1879 starving men fought to the death
for the bodies of dogs that had fattened on the corpses of their
dead countrymen. Mutton is sometimes for sale in Mohammedan
shops, and beef also, but it must not be imagined that either
sheep or ox is killed for its flesh, unless on the point of death
from starvation or disease. And the beef is not from the ox but
from the water buffalo. Sugar can be bought only in the larger
towns; salt can be purchased everywhere.</p>

<p>Beggars there are in numbers, skulking about almost naked,
with unkempt hair and no queue, with a small basket for gathering
garbage and a staff to keep away dogs. Only-beggars carry sticks
in China, and it is only the beggars that need beware of dogs. To
carry a stick in China for protection against dogs is like
carrying a red flag to scare away bulls. Dogs in China are lowly
organised; they are not discriminating animals; and, despite the
luxurious splendour of my Chinese dress--it cost more than seven
shillings--dogs frequently mistook my calling. In Szechuen, as we
passed through the towns, there was competition among the inns to
obtain our custom. Hotel runners were there to shout to all the
world the superior merits of their establishments. But here in
Yunnan it is different. There is barely inn accommodation for the
road traffic, and the innkeepers are either too apathetic or too
shamefaced to call the attention of the traveller to their poor
dirty accommodation houses.</p>

<p>In Szechuen, one of the most flourishing of trades is that of
the monumental mason and carver in stone. Huge monoliths are
there cut from the boulders which have been dislodged from the
mountains, dressed and finished in situ, and then removed to the
spot where they are to be erected. The Chinese thus pursue a
practice different from that of the Westerns, who bring the
undressed stone from the quarry and carve it in the studio. With
the Chinese the difficulty is one of transport--the finished work
is obviously lighter than the unhewn block. In Yunnan, up to the
present, I had seen no mason at work, for no masonry was needed.
Houses built of stone were falling into ruin, and only thatched,
mud-plastered, bamboo and wood houses were being built in their
places.</p>

<p>At Laowatan I told my Christian to hire me a chair for thirty
or forty li, and he did so; but the chair, instead of carrying me
the shorter distance, carried me the whole day. The following day
the chair kept company with me, and as I had not ordered it, I
naturally walked; but the third day also the chair haunted me,
and then I discovered that my admirable guide had engaged the
chair not for thirty or forty li, as I had instructed him in my
best Chinese, but for three hundred and sixty li, for four days'
stages of ninety li each. He had made the agreement "out of
consideration for me," and his own pocket; he had made an
agreement which gave him wider scope for a little private
arrangement of his own with the chair-coolies. For two days I was
paying fifteen cash a li for a chair and walking alongside of it
charmed by the good humour of the coolies, and unaware that they
were laughing in their sleeves at my folly. Trifling mistakes
like this are inevitable to one who travels in China without an
interpreter.</p>

<p>My two coolies were capital fellows, full of good humour,
cheerful, and untiring. The elder was disposed to be
argumentative with his countrymen, but he could not quarrel.
Nature had given him an uncontrollable stutter, and, if he tried
to speak quickly, spasm seized his tongue, and he had to break
into a laugh. Few men in China, I think, could be more curiously
constructed than this coolie. He was all neck; his chin was
simply an upward prolongation of his neck like a second "Adam's
apple." Both were very pleasant companions.</p>

<p>They were naturally in good humour, for they were well paid,
and their loads, as loads are in China, were almost
insignificant; I had only asked them to carry sixty-seven pounds
each.</p>

<p>We, who live amid the advantages of Western civilisation, can
hardly realise how enormous are the weights borne by those human
beasts of burthen, our brothers in China. The common
fast-travelling coolie of Szechuen contracts to carry eighty
catties (107 lbs.), forty miles a day over difficult country. But
the weight-carrying coolie, travelling shorter distances, carries
far heavier loads than that. There are porters, says Du Halde,
who will carry 160 of our pounds, ten leagues a day. The coolies,
engaged in carrying the compressed cakes of Szechuen tea into
Thibet, travel over mountain passes 7000 feet above their
starting place; yet there are those among them, says Von
Richthofen, who carry 324 catties (432 lbs.). A package of tea is
called a "pao" and varies in weight from eleven to eighteen
catties, yet Baber has often seen coolies carrying eighteen of
the eighteen-catty pao (the "Yachou pao") and on one occasion
twenty-two, in other words Baber has often seen coolies with more
than 400 lbs. on their backs. Under these enormous loads they
travel from six to seven miles a day. The average load of the
Thibetan tea-carrier is, says Gill, from 240 lbs. to 264 lbs.
Gill constantly saw "little boys carrying 120 lbs." Bundles of
calico weigh fifty-five catties each (73.5 lbs.), and three
bundles are the average load. Salt is solid, hard, metallic, and
of high specific gravity, yet I have seen men ambling along the
road, under loads that a strong Englishman could with difficulty
raise from the ground. The average load of salt, coal, copper,
zinc, and tin is 200 lbs. Gill met coolies carrying logs, 200
lbs. in weight, ten miles a day; and 200 lbs., the Consul in
Chungking told me, is the average weight carried by the
cloth-porters between Wanhsien and Chen-tu, the capital.</p>

<p>Mountain coolies, such as the tea-carriers, bear the weight of
their burden on their shoulders, carrying it as we do a knapsack,
not in the ordinary Chinese way, with a pliant carrying pole.
They are all provided with a short staff, which has a transverse
handle curved like a boomerang, and with this they ease the
weight off the back, while standing at rest.</p>

<p>We were still ascending the valley, which became more
difficult of passage every day. Hamlets are built where there is
scarce foothold in the detritus, below perpendicular escarpments
of rock, cut clean like the facades of a Gothic temple. A
tributary of the river is crossed by an admirable stone bridge of
two arches, with a central pier and cut-water of magnificent
boldness and strength, and with two images of lions guarding its
abutment. Just below the branch the main stream can be crossed by
a traveller, if he be brave enough to venture, in a bamboo
loop-cradle, and be drawn across the stream on a powerful bamboo
cable slung from bank to bank.</p>

<p>We rested by the bridge and refreshed ourselves, for above us
was an ascent whose steepness my stuttering coolie indicated to
me by fixing my walking stick in the ground, almost
perpendicularly, and running his finger up the side. He did not
exaggerate. A zigzag path set with stone steps has been cut in
the vertical ascent, and up this we toiled for hours. At the base
of the escalade my men sublet their loads to spare coolies who
were waiting there in numbers for the purpose, and climbed up
with me empty-handed. At every few turns there were rest-houses
where one could get tea and shelter from the hot sun. The village
of Tak-wan-leo is at the summit; it is a village of some little
importance and commands a noble view of mountain, valley, and
river. Its largest hong is the coffin-maker's, which is always
filled with shells of the thickest timber that money can buy.</p>

<p>Stress is laid in China upon the necessity of a secure
resting-place after death. The filial affection of a son can do
no more thoughtful act than present a coffin to his father, to
prove to him how composedly he will lie after he is dead. And
nothing will a father in China show the stranger with more pride
than the coffin-boards presented to him by his dutiful son.</p>

<p>Tak-wan-leo is the highest point on the road between Suifu and
Chaotong. For centuries it has been known to the Chinese as the
highest point; how, then, with their defective appliances did
they arrive at so accurate a determination? Twenty li beyond the
village the stage ends at the town of Tawantzu, where I had good
quarters in the pavilion of an old temple. The shrine was thick
with the dust of years; the three gods were dishevelled and
mutilated; no sheaves of joss sticks were smouldering on the
altar. The steps led down into manure heaps and a piggery, into a
garden rank and waste, which yet commands an outlook over
mountain and river worthy of the greatest of temples.</p>

<p><b>THE OPIUM-SMOKER OF ROMANCE</b></p>
</center>

<p>On March 30th I reached Tak-wan-hsien, the day's stage having
been seventy li (twenty-three and one-third miles). I was carried
all the way by three chair-coolies in a heavy chair in steady
rain that made the unpaved track as slippery as ice--and this
over the dizzy heights of a mountain pathway of extraordinary
irregularity. Never slipping, never making a mistake, the three
coolies bore the chair with my thirteen stone, easily and without
straining. From time to time they rested a minute or two to take
a whiff of tobacco; they were always in good humour, and finished
the day as strong and fresh as when they began it. Within an hour
of their arrival all these three men were lying on their sides in
the room opposite to mine, with their opium-pipes and little
wooden vials of opium before them, all three engaged in rolling
and heating in their opium-lamps treacly pellets of opium. Then
they had their daily smoke of opium. "They were ruining
themselves body and soul." Two of the men were past middle age;
the third was a strapping young fellow of twenty-five. They may
have only recently acquired the habit, I had no means of asking
them; but those who know Western China will tell you that it is
almost certain that the two elder men had used the opium-pipe as
a stimulant since they were as young as their companion. All
three men were physically well-developed, with large frames,
showing unusual muscular strength and endurance, and differed,
indeed, from those resurrected corpses whose fleshless figures,
drawn by imaginative Chinese artists, we have known for years to
be typical of our poor lost brothers--the opium-smoking millions
of China. For their work to-day, work that few men out of China
would be capable of attempting, the three coolies were paid
sevenpence each, out of which they found themselves, and had to
pay as well one penny each for the hire of the chair.</p>

<p>On arriving at the inn in Tak-wan-hsien my 'estimable comrade,
one of the six surviving converts of Suifu, indicated to me that
his cash belt was empty--up the road he could not produce a
single cash for me to give a beggar--and pointing in turn to the
bag where I kept my silver, to the ceiling and to his heart, he
conveyed to me the pious assurance that if I would give him some
silver from the bag he would bring me back the true change, on
his honour, so witness Heaven! I gave him two lumps of silver
which I made him understand were worth 3420 cash; he went away,
and after a suspicious absence returned quite gleefully with 3050
cash, the bank, no doubt, having detained the remainder pending
the declaration of a bogus dividend. But he also brought back
with him what was better than cash, some nutritious maize-meal
cakes, which proved a welcome change from the everlasting rice.
They were as large as an English scone, and cost two cash apiece,
that is to say, for one shilling I could buy twenty dozen.</p>

<p>Money in Western China consists of solid ingots of silver, and
copper cash. The silver is in lumps of one tael or more each, the
tael being a Chinese ounce and equivalent roughly to between 1400
and 1500 cash. Speaking generally a tael was worth, during my
journey, three shillings, that is to say, forty cash were
equivalent to one penny. There are bankers in every town, and the
Chinese methods of banking, it is well known, are but little
inferior to our own. From Hankow to Chungking my money was
remitted by draft through a Chinese bank. West from Chungking the
money may be sent by draft, by telegraph, or in bullion, as you
choose. I carried some silver with me; the rest I put up in a
package and handed to a native post in Chungking, which undertook
to deliver it intact to me at Yunnan city, 700 miles away, within
a specified time. By my declaring its contents and paying the
registration fee, a mere trifle, the post guaranteed its safe
delivery, and engaged to make good any loss. Money is thus
remitted in Western China with complete confidence and security.
My money arrived, I may add, in Yunnan at the time agreed upon,
but after I had left for Talifu. As there is a telegraph line
between Yunnan and Tali, the money was forwarded by telegraph and
awaited my arrival in Tali.</p>

<p>There are no less than four native post-offices between
Chungking and Suifu. All the post-offices transmit parcels, as
well as letters and bullion, at very moderate charges. The
distance is 230 miles, and the charges are fifty cash
(1.25<i>d</i>.) the catty (1.33 lb.), or any part thereof; thus a
single letter pays fifty cash, a catty's weight of letters paying
no more than a single letter.</p>

<p>From Chungking to Yunnan city, a distance of 630 miles,
letters pay two hundred cash (fivepence) each; packages of one
catty, or under, pay three hundred and fifty cash; while for
silver bullion there is a special fee of three hundred and fifty
cash for every ten taels, equivalent to ninepence for thirty
shillings, or two-and-a-half per cent., which includes postage,
registration, guarantee, and insurance.</p>

<p>Tak-wan-hsien is a town of some importance, and was formerly
the seat of the French missionary bishop. It is a walled town,
ranking as a Hsien city, with a Hsien magistrate as its chief
ruler. There are 10,000 people (more or less), within the walls,
but the city is poor, and its poverty is but a reflex of the
district. Its mud wall is crumbling; its houses of mud and wood
are falling; the streets are ill paved and the people
ill-clad.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII. THE CITY OF CHAOTONG; WITH SOME REMARKS ON ITS
POVERTY, INFANTICIDE, SELLING FEMALE CHILDREN INTO SLAVERY,
TORTURES, AND THE CHINESE INSENSIBILITY TO PAIN.</h3>

<p>By the following day we had crossed the mountains, and were
walking along the level upland that leads to the plain of
Chaotong. And on Sunday, April 1st, we reached the city. Cedars,
held sacred, with shrines in the shelter of their branches, dot
the plain; peach-trees and pear-trees were now in full bloom; the
harvest was ripening in the fields. There were black-faced sheep
in abundance, red cattle with short horns, and the ubiquitous
water-buffalo. Over the level roads primitive carts, drawn by red
oxen, were rumbling in the dust. There were mud villages, poor
and falling into ruins; there were everywhere signs of poverty
and famine. Children ran about naked, or in rags. We passed the
likin-barrier, known by its white flag, and I was not even asked
for my visiting card, nor were my boxes looked into--they were as
beggarly as the district--but poor carriers were detained, and a
few cash unjustly wrung from them. At a crowded-teahouse, a few
miles from the city, we waited for the stragglers, while many
wayfarers gathered in to see me. Prices were ranging higher. Tea
here was 4 cash, and not 2 cash as hitherto. But even this charge
was not excessive.</p>

<p>In Canton one day, after a weary journey on foot through the
crowded streets, I was taken to a five-storied pagoda overlooking
the city. At the topmost story tea was brought me, and I drank a
dozen cups, and was asked threepence in payment. I thought that
the cheapest refreshment I ever had. Yet here I was served as
abundantly with better tea at a charge compared with which the
Canton charge was twenty-five times greater. Previously in this
province the price I had paid for tea in comparison with the
price at Canton was as one to fifty.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon we passed through the south gate into
Chaotong, and, picking our way through the streets, were led to
the comfortable home of the Bible Christian Mission, where I was
kindly received by the Rev. Frank Dymond, and welcomed as a
brother missionary of whose arrival he had been advised. Services
were ended, but the neighbours dropped in to see the stranger,
and ask my exalted age, my honourable name, and my dignified
business; they hoped to be able to congratulate me upon being a
man of virtue, the father of many sons; asked how many thousands
of pieces of silver I had (daughters), and how long I proposed to
permit my dignified presence to remain in their mean and
contemptible city.</p>

<p>Mr. Dymond is a Devonshire man, and that evening he gave me
for tea Devonshire cream and blackberry jam made in Chaotong, and
native oatmeal cakes, than which I never tasted any better in
Scotland.</p>

<p>Chaotong is a walled Fu city with 40,000 inhabitants. Roman
Catholics have been established here for many years, and the
Bible Christian Mission, which is affiliated to the China Inland
Mission, has been working here since 1887.</p>

<p>There were formerly five missionaries; there are now only two,
and one of these was absent. The missionary in charge, Mr. Frank
Dymond, is one of the most agreeable men I met in China,
broad-minded, sympathetic and earnest--universally honoured and
respected by all the district. Since the mission was opened three
converts have been baptised, one of whom is in Szechuen, another
is in Tongchuan, and the third has been gathered to his fathers.
The harvest has not been abundant, but there are now six
promising inquirers, and the missionary is not discouraged. The
mission premises are built on land which cost two hundred and
ninety taels, and are well situated not far from the south gate,
the chief yamens, the temples, and the French Mission. People are
friendly, but manifest dangerously little interest in their
salvation.</p>

<p>At Chaotong I had entered upon a district that had been
devastated by recurring seasons of plague and famine. Last year
more than 5000 people are believed to have died from starvation
in the town and its immediate neighbourhood. The numbers are
appalling, but doubt must always be thrown upon statistics
derived from Chinese sources. The Chinese and Japanese disregard
of accuracy is characteristic of all Orientals. Beggars were so
numerous, and became such a menace to the community, that their
suppression was called for; they were driven from the streets,
and confined within the walls of the temple and grounds beyond
the south gate, and fed by common charity. Huddled together in
rags and misery, they took famine fever and perished by hundreds.
Seventy dead were carried from the temple in one day. Of 5000
poor wretches who crossed the temple threshold, the Chinese say
that 2000 never came out alive. For four years past the harvests
had been very bad, but there was now hope of a better time
coming. Opportune rains had fallen, and the opium crop was good.
More than anything else the district depends for its prosperity
upon the opium crop--if the crop is good, money is plentiful.
Maize-cobs last harvest were four times the size of those of the
previous harvest, when they were no larger than one's finger.
Wheat and beans were forward; the coming rice crop gave every
hope of being a good one. Food was still dear, and all prices
were high, because rice was scarce and dear, and it is the price
of rice which regulates the market. In a good year one sheng of
rice (6.66 lbs.) costs thirty-five cash (less than one penny), it
now costs no cash. The normal price of maize is sixteen cash the
sheng, it now cost sixty-five cash the sheng. To make things
worse, the weight of the sheng had been reduced with the times
from twelve catties to five catties, and at the same time the
relation of cash to silver had fallen from 1640 to 1250 cash the
tael.</p>

<p>The selling of its female children into slavery is the chief
sorrow of this famine-stricken district. During last year it is
estimated, or rather, it is stated by the Chinese, that no less
than three thousand children from this neighbourhood, chiefly
female children and a few boys, were sold to dealers and carried
like poultry in baskets to the capital. At ordinary times the
price for girls is one tael (three shillings) for every year of
their age, thus a girl of five costs fifteen shillings, of ten,
thirty shillings, but in time of famine children, to speak
brutally, become a drug in the market. Female children were now
offering at from three shillings and fourpence to six shillings
each. You could buy as many as you cared to, you might even
obtain them for nothing if you would enter into an agreement with
the father, which he had no means of enforcing, to take care of
his child, and clothe and feed her, and rear her kindly. Starving
mothers would come to the mission beseeching the foreign teachers
to take their babies and save them from the fate that was
otherwise inevitable.</p>

<p>Girls are bought in Chaotong up to the age of twenty, and
there is always a ready market for those above the age of
puberty; prices then vary according to the measure of the girl's
beauty, an important feature being the smallness of her feet.
They are sold in the capital for wives and yato-ws; they are
rarely sold into prostitution. Two important factors in the
demand for them are the large preponderance in the number of
males at the capital, and the prevalence there of goitre or thick
neck, a deformity which is absent from the district of Chaotong.
Infanticide in a starving city like this is dreadfully common.
"For the parents, seeing their children must be doomed to
poverty, think it better at once to let the soul escape in search
of a more happy asylum than to linger in one condemned to want
and wretchedness." The infanticide is, however, exclusively
confined to the destruction of female children, the sons being
permitted to live in order to continue the ancestral
sacrifices.</p>

<p>One mother I met, who was employed by the mission, told the
missionary in ordinary conversation that she had suffocated in
turn three of her female children within a few days of birth;
and, when a fourth was born, so enraged was her husband to
discover that it was also a girl that he seized it by the legs
and struck it against the wall and killed it.</p>

<p>Dead children, and often living infants, are thrown out on the
common among the gravemounds, and may be seen there any morning
being gnawed by dogs. Mr. Tremberth of the Bible Christian
Mission, leaving by the south gate early one morning, disturbed a
dog eating a still living child that had been thrown over the
wall during the night. Its little arm was crunched and stript of
flesh, and it was whining inarticulately--it died almost
immediately. A man came to see me; who for a long time used to
heap up merit for himself in heaven by acting as a city
scavenger. Early every morning he went round the city picking up
dead dogs and dead cats in order to bury them decently--who could
tell, perhaps the soul of his grandfather had found habitation in
that cat? While he was doing this pious work, never a morning
passed that he did not find a dead child, and usually three or
four. The dead of the poor people are roughly buried near the
surface and eaten by dogs.</p>

<p>An instance of the undoubted truth of the doctrine of
transmigration occurred recently in Chaotong and is worth
recording. A cow was killed near the south gate on whose
intestine--and this fact can be attested by all who saw it--was
written plainly and unmistakably the character "Wong," which
proved, they told me, that the soul of one whose name was Wong
had returned to earth in the body of that cow.</p>

<p>I stayed two days in Chaotong, and strolled in pleasant
company through the city. Close to the Mission is the yamen of
the Chentai or Brigadier-General, the Military Governor of this
portion of the province, and a little further is the more crowded
yamen of the Fu Magistrate. Here, as in all yamens, the detached
wall or fixed screen of stone facing the entrance is painted with
the gigantic representation of a mythical monster in red trying
to swallow the sun--the Chinese illustration of the French saying
"prendre la lune avec les dents." It is the warning against
covetousness, the exhortation against squeezing, and is as little
likely to be attended to by the magistrate here as it would be by
his brother in Chicago. We visited the Confucian Temple among the
trees and the examination hall close by, and another yamen, and
the Temple of the God of Riches. In the yamen, at the time of our
visit, a young official, seated in his four-bearer chair, was
waiting in the outer court; he had sent in his visiting card, and
attended the pleasure of his superior officer. China may be
uncivilised and may yearn for the missionaries, but there was
refined etiquette in China, and an interchange of many of the
pleasantest courtesies of modern civilisation, when we noble
Britons were grubbing in the forest, painted savages with a
clout.</p>

<p>As we went out of the west gate, I was shown the spot where a
few days before a young woman, taken in adultery, was done to
death in a cage amid a crowd of spectators, who witnessed her
agony for three days. She had to stand on tiptoe in the cage, her
head projecting through a hole in the roof, and here she had to
remain until death by exhaustion or strangulation ensued, or till
some kind friend, seeking to accumulate merit in heaven, passed
into her mouth sufficient opium to poison her, and so end her
struggles.</p>

<p>On the gate itself a man not so long ago was nailed with
red-hot nails hammered through his wrists above the hands. In
this way he was exposed in turn at each of the four gates of the
city, so that every man, woman, and child could see his torture.
He survived four days, having unsuccessfully attempted to shorten
his pain by beating his head against the woodwork, an attempt
which was frustrated by padding the woodwork. This man had
murdered and robbed two travellers on the high road, and, as
things are in China, his punishment was not too severe.</p>

<p>No people are more cruel in their punishments than the
Chinese, and obviously the reason is that the sensory nervous
system of a Chinaman is either blunted or of arrested
development. Can anyone doubt this who witnesses the stoicism
with which a Chinaman can endure physical pain when sustaining
surgical operation without chloroform, the comfort with which he
can thrive amid foul and penetrating smells, the calmness with
which he can sleep amid the noise of gunfire and crackers, drums
and tomtoms, and the indifference with which he contemplates the
sufferings of lower animals, and the infliction of tortures on
higher?</p>

<p>Every text-book on China devotes a special chapter to the
subject of punishment. Mutilation is extremely common. Often I
met men who had been deprived of their ears--they had lost them,
they explained, in battle facing the enemy! It is a common
punishment to sever the hamstrings or to break the ankle-bones,
especially in the case of prisoners who have attempted to escape.
And I remember that when I was in Shanghai, Mr. Tsai, the Mixed
Court Magistrate, was reproved by the papers because he had from
the bench expressed his regret that the foreign law of Shanghai
did not permit him to punish in this way a prisoner who had twice
succeeded in breaking from gaol. The hand is cut off for theft as
it was in England not so many years ago. I have seen men with the
tendon of Achilles cut out, and it is worth noting that the
Chinese say that this "acquired deformity" can be cured by the
transplantation in the seat of injury of the tendon of a sheep.
One embellishment of the Chinese punishment of flogging might
with good effect be introduced into England. After a Chinese
flagellation, the culprit is compelled to go down on his knees
and humbly thank the magistrate for the trouble he has been put
to to correct his morals.</p>

<p>There is a branch of the Missions Etrangeres de Paris in
Chaotong. I called at the mission and saw their school of fifteen
children, and their tiny little church. One priest lives here
solitary and alone; he was reading, when I entered, the famous
Chinese story, "The Three Kingdoms." He gave me a kindly welcome,
and was pleased to talk in his own tongue. An excellent bottle of
rich wine was produced, and over the glass the Father painted
with voluble energy the evil qualities of the people whom he has
left his beautiful home in the Midi of France to lead to Rome.
"No Chinaman can resist temptation; all are thieves. Justice
depends on the richness of the accused. Victory in a court of
justice is to the richer. Talk to the Chinese of Religion, of a
God, of Heaven or Hell, and they yawn; speak to them of business
and they are all attention. If you ever hear of a Chinaman who is
not a thief and a liar, do not believe it, Monsieur Morrison, do
not believe it; they are thieves and liars every one."</p>

<p>For eight years the priest had been in China devoting his best
energies to the propagation of his religion. And sorry had been
his recompense. The best Christian in the mission had lately
broken into the mission house and stolen everything valuable he
could lay his impious hands on. Remembrance of this infamy
rankled in his bosom and impelled him to this expansive panegyric
on Chinese virtue.</p>

<p>Some four months ago the good father was away on a holiday,
visiting a missionary brother in an adjoining town. In his
absence the mission was entered through a rift made in the wall,
and three hundred taels of silver, all the money to the last sou
that he possessed, were stolen. Suspicion fell upon a Christian,
who was not only an active Catholic himself, but whose fathers
before him had been Catholics for generations. It was learned
that his wife had some of the money, and that the thief was on
his way to Suifu with the remainder. There was great difficulty
in inducing the yamen to take action, but at last the wife was
arrested. She protested that she knew nothing; but, having been
triced up by the wrists joined behind her back, she soon came to
reason, and cried out that, if the magistrate would release her
hands, she would confess air. Two hundred taels were seized in
her house and restored to the priest, and the culprit, her
husband, followed to Tak-wan-hsien by the satellites of the
yamen, was there arrested, and was now in prison awaiting
punishment. The goods he purchased were likewise seized and were
now with the poor father.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX. MAINLY ABOUT CHINESE DOCTORS.</h3>

<p>Chaotong is an important centre for the distribution of
medicines to Szechuen and other parts of the empire. An
extraordinary variety of drugs and medicaments is collected in
the city. No pharmacopoeia is more comprehensive than the
Chinese. No English physician can surpass the Chinese in the easy
confidence with which he will diagnose symptoms that he does not
understand. The Chinese physician who witnesses the unfortunate
effect of placing a drug of which he knows nothing into a body of
which he knows less, is no more disconcerted than is his Western
brother under similar circumstances; he retires, sententiously
observing "there is medicine for sickness but none for fate."
"Medicine," says the Chinese proverb, "cures the man who is fated
not to die." "When Yenwang (the King of Hell) has decreed a man
to die at the third watch, no power will detain him till the
fifth."</p>

<p>The professional knowledge of a Chinese doctor largely
consists in ability to feel the pulse, or rather the innumerable
pulses of his Chinese patient. This is the real criterion of his
skill. The pulses of a Chinaman vary in a manner that no English
doctor can conceive of. For instance, among the seven kinds of
pulse which presage approaching death, occur the five
following:--</p>

<p>When the pulse is perceived under the fingers to bubble
irregularly like water over a great fire, if it be in the morning
the patient will die in the evening.</p>

<p>Death is no farther off if the pulse seems like a fish whose
head is stopped in such a manner that he cannot move but has a
frisking tail without any regularity; the cause of this distemper
lies in the kidneys.</p>

<p>If the pulse seems like drops of water that fall into a room
through some crack, and when in its return it is scattered and
disordered much like the twine of a cord which is unravelled, the
bones are dried up even to the very marrow.</p>

<p>Likewise if the motion of the pulse resembles the pace of a
frog when he is embarrassed in the weeds, death is certain.</p>

<p>If the motion of the pulse resembles the hasty pecking of the
beak of a bird, there is a defect of spirits in the stomach.</p>

<p>Heredity is the most important factor in the evolution of a
doctor in China, success in his career as an "hereditary
physician" being specially assured to him who has the good
fortune to make his first appearance in the world feet foremost.
Doctors dispense their own medicines. In their shops you see an
amazing variety of drugs; you will occasionally also see tethered
a live stag, which on a certain day, to be decided by the
priests, will be pounded whole in a pestle and mortar. "Pills
manufactured out of a whole stag slaughtered with purity of
purpose on a propitious day," is a common announcement in
dispensaries in China. The wall of a doctor's shop is usually
stuck all over with disused plasters returned by grateful
patients with complimentary testimonies to their efficiency; they
have done what England is alleged to expect of all her
sons--their duty.</p>

<p>Medicines, it is known to all Chinamen, operate variously
according to their taste, thus:--"All sour medicines are capable
of impeding and retaining; bitter medicines of causing looseness
and warmth as well as hardening; sweet possess the qualities of
strengthening, of harmonising, and of warming; acids disperse,
prove emollient, and go in an athwart direction; salt medicines
possess the properties of descending; those substances that are
hard and tasteless open the orifices of the body and promote a
discharge. This explains the use of the five tastes."</p>

<p>Coming from Szechuen, we frequently met porters carrying
baskets of armadillos, leopard skins, leopard and tiger bones.
The skins were for wear, but the armadillos and bones were being
taken to Suifu to be converted into medicine. From the bones of
leopards an admirable tonic may be distilled; while it is well
known that the infusion prepared from tiger bones is the greatest
of the tonics, conferring something of the courage, agility, and
strength of the tiger upon its partaker.</p>

<p>Another excellent specific for courage is a preparation made
from the gall bladder of a robber famous for his bravery, who has
died at the hands of the executioner. The sale of such a gall
bladder is one of the perquisites of a Chinese executioner.</p>

<p>Ague at certain seasons is one of the most common ailments of
the district of Chaotong, yet there is an admirable prophylactic
at hand against it: write the names of the eight demons of ague
on paper, and then eat the paper with a cake; or take out the
eyes of the paper door-god (there are door-gods on all your
neighbours' doors), and devour them--this remedy never fails.</p>

<p>Unlike the Spaniard, the Chinese disapproves of bloodletting
in fevers, "for a fever is like a pot boiling; it is requisite to
reduce the fire and not diminish the liquid in the vessel, if we
wish to cure the patient."</p>

<p>Unlike the Spaniard, too, the Chinese doctors would not
venture to assert, as the medical faculty of Madrid in the middle
of last century assured the inhabitants, that "if human excrement
was no longer to be suffered to accumulate as usual in the
streets, where it might attract the putrescent particles floating
in the air, these noxious vapours would find their way into the
human body and a pestilential sickness would be the inevitable
consequence."</p>

<p>For boils there is a certain cure:--There is a God of Boils.
If you have a boil you will plaster the offending excrescence
without avail, if that be all you plaster; to get relief you must
at the same time plaster the corresponding area on the image of
the God. Go into his temple in Western China, and you will find
this deity dripping with plasters, with scarcely an undesecrated
space on his superficies.</p>

<p>At the yamen of the Brigadier-General in Chaotong, the
entrance is guarded by the customary stone images of mythical
shape and grotesque features. They are believed to represent
lions, but their faces are not leonine--they are a reproduction,
exaggerated, of the characteristic features of the bulldog of
Western China. The images are of undoubted value to the city. One
is male and the other female. On the sixteenth day of the first
month they are visited by the townspeople, who rub them
energetically with their hands, all over from end to end. Every
spot so touched confers immunity from pain upon the corresponding
region of their own bodies for the ensuing year. And so from year
to year these images are visited. Fain accordingly is almost
absent from the city, and only that man suffers pain who has the
temerity to neglect the opportunity of insuring himself against
it.</p>

<p>I was called to a case of opium-poisoning in Chaotong. A son
came in casually to seek our aid in saving his father, who had
attempted suicide with a large over-dose of opium. He had taken
it at ten in the morning and it was now two. We were led to the
house and found it a single small unlit room up a narrow alley.
In the room two men were unconcernedly eating their rice, and in
the darkness they seemed to be the only occupants; but, lying
down behind them on a narrow bed, was the dim figure of the dying
man, who was breathing stertorously. A crowd quickly gathered
round the door and pent up the alley-way. Rousing the man, I
caused him to swallow some pints of warm water, and then I gave
him a hypodermic injection of apomorphia. The effect was
admirable, and pleased the spectators even more than the
patient.</p>

<p>Opium is almost exclusively the drug used by suicides. No
Chinaman would kill himself by the mutilation of the razor or
pistol-shot because awful is the future punishment of him who
would so dare to disturb the integrity of the body bequeathed to
him by his fathers.</p>

<p>China is the land of suicides. I suppose more people die from
suicide in China in proportion to the population than in any
other country. Where the struggle for existence is so keen, it is
hardly to be wondered at that men are so willing to abandon the
struggle. But poverty and misery are not the only causes. For the
most trivial reason the Chinaman will take his own life. Suicide
with a Chinaman is an act that is recorded in his honour rather
than to his opprobrium.</p>

<p>Thus a widow, as we have seen, may obtain much merit by
sacrificing herself on the death of her husband. But in a large
proportion of cases the motive is revenge, for the spirit of the
dead is believed to "haunt and injure the living person who has
been the cause of the suicide." In China to ruin your adversary
you injure or kill yourself. To vow to commit suicide is the most
awful threat with which you can drive terror into the heart of
your adversary. If your enemy do you wrong, there is no way in
which you can cause him more bitterly to repent his misdeed, than
by slaying yourself at his doorstep. He will be charged with your
murder and may be executed for the crime; he will be utterly
ruined in establishing, if he can establish, his innocence; and
he will be haunted ever after by your avenging spirit.</p>

<p>Occasionally two men who have quarrelled will take poison
together, and their spirits will fight it out in heaven. Opium is
very cheap in Chaotong, costing only fivepence an ounce for the
crude article. You see it exposed for sale everywhere, like thick
treacle in dirty besmeared jars. It is largely adulterated with
ground pigskin, the adulteration being detected by the craving
being unsatisfied. Mohammedans have a holy loathing of the pig,
and look with contempt on their countrymen whose chief meat-food
is pork. But each one in his turn. It is, on the other hand, a
source of infinite amusement to the Chinese to see his Mohammedan
brother unwittingly smoking the unclean beast in his
opium-pipe.</p>

<p>On our way to the opium case we passed a doorway from which
pitiful screams were issuing. It was a mother thrashing her
little boy with a heavy stick--she had tethered him by the leg
and was using the stick with both hands. A Chinese proverb as old
as the hills tells you, "if you love your son, give him plenty of
the cudgel; if you hate him, cram him with delicacies." He was a
young wretch, she said, and she could do nothing with him; and
she raised her baton again to strike, but the missionary
interposed, whereupon she consented to stay her wrath and did
so--till we were round the corner.</p>

<p>"Extreme lenity alternating with rude passion in the treatment
of children is the characteristic," says Meadows, "of the lower
stages of civilisation." I mention this incident only because of
its rarity. In no other country in the world, civilised or
"heathen," are children generally treated with more kindness and
affection than they are in China. "Children, even amongst
seemingly stolid Chinese, have the faculty of calling forth the
better feelings so often found latent. Their prattle delights the
fond father, whose pride beams through every line of his
countenance, and their quaint and winning ways and touches of
nature are visible even under the disadvantages of almond eyes
and shaven crowns" (Dyer Ball).</p>

<p>A mother in China is given, both by law and custom, extreme
power over her sons whatever their age or rank. The Sacred Edict
says, "Parents are like heaven. Heaven produces a blade of grass.
Spring causes it to germinate. Autumn kills it with frost. Both
are by the will of heaven. In like manner the power of life and
death over the body which they have begotten is with the
parents."</p>

<p>And it is this law giving such power to a mother in China
which tends, it is believed, to nullify that other law whereby a
husband in, China is given extreme power over his wife, even to
the power in some cases of life and death.</p>

<p>The Mohammedans are still numerous in Chaotong, and there are
some 3000 families--the figures are Chinese--in the city and
district. Their numbers were much reduced during the suppression
of the rebellion of 1857-1873, when they suffered the most awful
cruelties. Again, thirteen years ago there was an uprising which
was suppressed by the Government with merciless severity. One
street is exclusively occupied by Moslems, who have in their
hands the skin trade of the city. Their houses are known by a
conspicuous absence from door and window of the coloured paper
door-gods that are seen grotesquely glaring from the doors of the
unbelievers. Their mosque is well cared for and unusually clean.
In the centre, within the main doorway, as in every mosque in the
empire, is a gilt tablet of loyalty to the living Emperor. "May
the Emperor reign ten thousand years!" it says, a token of
subjection which the mosques of Yunnan have especially been
compelled to display since the insurrection. At the time of my
visit an aged mollah was teaching Arabic and the Koran to a
ragged handful of boys. He spoke to me through an interpreter,
and gave me the impression of having some little knowledge of
things outside the four seas that surround China. I told him that
I had lived under the shelter of two of the greatest mosques, but
he seemed to question my contention that the mosque in Cordova
and the Karouin mosque in Fez are even more noble in their
proportions than his mosque in Chaotong. In some of the
skin-hongs that I entered, the walls were ornamented with
coloured plans of Mecca and Medinah, bought in Chentu, the
capital city of the province of Szechuen.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X. THE JOURNEY FROM CHAOTONG TO TONGCHUAN.</h3>

<p>In Chaotong I engaged three new men to go with me to
Tongchuan, a distance of no miles, and I rewarded liberally the
three excellent fellows who had accompanied me from Suifu. My new
men were all active Chinamen. The headman Laohwan was most
anxious to come with me. Recognising that he possessed
characteristics which his posterity would rejoice to have
transmitted to them, he had lately taken to himself a wife and
now, a fortnight later, he sought rest. He would come with me to
Burma, the further away the better; he wished to prove the truth
of the adage about distance and enchantment. The two coolies who
were to carry the loads were country lads from the district. My
men were to receive 4<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. each for the no miles,
an excessive wage, but all food was unusually dear, and people
were eating maize instead of rice; they were to find themselves
on the way, in other words, they were "to eat their own rice,"
and, in return for a small reward, they were to endeavour to do
the five days' stages in three days. I bought a few stores,
including some excellent oatmeal and an annular cake of that
compressed tea, the "Puerh-cha," which is grown in the Shan
States and is distributed as a luxury all over China. It is in
favour in the palace of the Emperor in Peking itself; it is one
of the finest teas in China, yet, to show how jealous the rivalry
now is between China tea and Indian, when I submitted the
remainder of this very cake to a well-known tea-taster in Mangoe
Lane Calcutta, and asked his expert opinion, he reported that the
sample was "of undoubted value and of great interest, as showing
what muck can be called tea."</p>

<p>We left on the 3rd, and passed by the main-street through the
crowded city, past the rich wholesale warehouses, and out by the
west gate to the plain of Chaotong. The country spread before us
was smiling and rich, with many farmsteads, and orchards of pears
and peaches--a pretty sight, for the trees were now in full
blossom. Many carts were lumbering along the road on their uneven
wheels. Just beyond the city there was a noisy altercation in the
road for the possession apparently of a blunt adze. Carts stopped
to see the row, and all the bystanders joined in with their
voices, with much earnestness. It is rare for the disputants to
be injured in these questions. Their language on these occasions
is, I am told, extremely rich in allusions. It would often make a
gendarme blush. Their oaths are more ornate than the Italians';
the art of vituperation is far advanced in China. A strong wind
was blowing in our faces. We rested at some mud hovels where
poverty was stalking about with a stick in rags and nakedness.
Full dress of many of these beggars would disgrace a Polynesian.
Even the better dressed were hung with garments in rags,
tattered, and dirty as a Paisley ragpicker's. The children were
mostly stark-naked. In the middle of the day we reached a
Mohammedan village named Taouen, twenty miles from Chaotong, and
my man prepared me an al fresco lunch. The entire village
gathered into the square to see me eat; they struggled for the
orange peel I threw under the table.</p>

<p>From here the road rises quickly to the village of Tashuitsing
(7380 feet above sea level), where my men wished to remain, and
apparently came to an understanding with the innkeeper; but I
would not understand and went on alone, and they perforce had to
follow me. There are only half-a-dozen rude inns in the village,
all Mohammedan; but just outside the village the road passes
under a magnificent triple archway in four tiers made of
beautifully cut stone, embossed with flowers and images, and
richly gilt--a striking monument in so forlorn a situation. It
was built two years ago, in obedience to the will of the Emperor,
by the richest merchant of Chaotong, and is dedicated to the
memory of his virtuous mother, who died at the age of eighty,
having thus experienced the joy of old age, which in China is the
foremost of the five measures of felicity. It was erected and
carved on the spot by masons from Chungking. Long after dark we
reached an outlying inn of the village of Kiangti, a thatched mud
barn, with a sleeping room surrounded on three sides by a raised
ledge of mud bricks upon which were stretched the mattresses. The
room was dimly lit by an oil-lamp; the floor was earth; the
grating under the rafters was stored with maize-cobs. Outside the
door cooking was done in the usual square earthen stove, in which
are sunk two iron basins, one for rice, the other for hot water;
maize stalks were being burnt in the flues. The room, when we
entered, was occupied by a dozen Chinese, with their loads and
the packsaddles of a caravan of mules; yet what did the
good-natured fellows do? They must all have been more tired than
I; but, without complaining, they a'l got up when they saw me,
and packed their things and went out of the room, one after the
other, to make way for myself and my companions. And, while we
were comfortable, they crowded into another room that was already
crowded.</p>

<p>Next day a tremendously steep descent took us down to Kiangti,
a mountain village on the right bank of a swift stream, here
spanned in its rocky pass by a beautiful suspension bridge, which
swings gracefully high above the torrent. The bridge is 150 feet
long by 12 feet broad, and there is no engineer in England who
might not be proud to have been its builder. At its far end the
parapets are guarded by two sculptured monkeys, hewn with rough
tools out of granite, and the more remarkable for their fidelity
of form, seeing that the artist must have carved them from
memory. The inevitable likin-barrier is at the bridge to squeeze
a few more cash out of the poor carriers. That the Inland Customs
dues of China are vexatious there can be no doubt; yet it is open
to question if the combined duties of all the likin barriers on
any one main-road extending from frontier to frontier of any
single province in China are greater than the ad valorem duties
imposed by our colony of Victoria upon the protected goods
crossing her border from an adjoining colony.</p>

<p><b>PAGODA BY THE WAYSIDE, WESTERN CHINA</b></p>
</center>

<p>Leaving the bridge, the road leads again up the hills. Poppy
was now in full flower, and everywhere in the fields women were
collecting opium. They were scoring the poppy capsules with
vertical scratches and scraping off the exuded juice which had
bled from the incisions they made yesterday. Hundreds of pack
horses carrying Puerh tea met us on the road; while all day long
we were passing files of coolies toiling patiently along under
heavy loads of crockery. They were going in the same direction as
ourselves to the confines of the empire, distributing those
teacups, saucers, and cuplids, china spoons, and rice-bowls that
one sees in every inn in China. Most of the crockery is brought
across China from the province of Kiangsi, whose natural
resources seems to give it almost the monopoly of this industry.
The trade is an immense one. In the neighbourhood of
King-teh-chin, in Kiangsi, at the outbreak of the Taiping
rebellion, more than one million workmen were employed in the
porcelain manufactories. Cups and saucers by the time they reach
so far distant a part of China as this, carried as they are so
many hundreds of miles on the backs of coolies, are sold for
three or four times their original cost. Great care is taken of
them, and no piece can be so badly broken as not to be mended.
Crockery-repairing is a recognised trade, and the workmen are
unusually skilful even for Chinese. They rivet the pieces
together with minute copper clamps. To have a specimen of their
handiwork I purposely in Yunnan broke a cup and saucer into
fragments, only to find when I had done so that there was not a
mender in the district. Rice bowls and teacups are neatly made,
tough, and well finished; even the humblest are not inelegantly
coloured, while the high-class china, especially where the
imperial yellow is used, often shows the richest beauty of
ornamentation.</p>

<p>Inns on this road were few and at wide distances; they were
scarcely sufficient for the numbers who used them. The country
was red sandstone, open, and devoid of all timber, till,
descending again into a valley, the path crossed an obstructing
ridge, and led us with pleasant surprise into a beautiful park.
It was all green and refreshing. A pretty stream was humming past
the willows, its banks covered with the poppy in full flower, a
blaze of colour, magenta, white, scarlet, pink and blue picked
out with hedges of roses. The birds were as tame as in the Garden
of Eden; magpies came almost to our feet; the sparrows took no
notice of us; the falcons knew we would not molest them; the
pigeons seemed to think we could not.</p>

<p>All was peaceful, and the peasants who sat with us under the
cedars on the borders of the park were friendly and unobtrusive.
Long after sundown we reached, far from the regular stage, a
lonely pair of houses, at one of which we found uncomfortable
accommodation. Fire had to be kindled in the room in a hollow in
the ground; there was no ventilation, the wood was green, the
smoke almost suffocating. My men talked on far into the night
until I lost patience and yelled at them in English. They thought
that I was swearing, and desisted for fear that I should injure
their ancestors. There was a shrine in this room for private
devotions, the corresponding spot in the adjoining room being a
rough opium-couch already occupied by two lusty thickset "slaves
to this thrice-accursed drug." My men ate the most frugal of
suppers. Food was so much in advance of its ordinary price that
my men, in common with thousands of other coolies, were doing
their hard work on starvation rations.</p>

<p>On the 5th we did a long day's stage and spent the night at a
bleak hamlet 8500 feet above sea level, in a position so exposed
that the roofs of the houses were weighted with stones to prevent
their being carried away by the wind. This was the "Temple of the
Dragon King," and it was only twenty li from Tongchuan.</p>

<p>Next day we were astir early and soon after daylight we came
suddenly to the brow of the tableland overlooking the valley of
Tongchuan. The compact little walled city, with its whitewashed
buildings glistening in the morning sun, lay beyond the gleaming
plats of the irrigated plain, snugly ensconced under rolling
masses of hills, which rose at the far end of the valley to lofty
mountains covered with snow. All the plain is watered with
springs; large patches of it are under water all the year round,
and, rendered thus useless for cultivation, are employed by the
Chinese for the artificial rearing of fish and as breeding
grounds for the wild duck and the "faithful bird," the wild
goose. A narrow dyke serpentining across the plain leads into the
pretty city, where, at the north-east angle of the wall, I was
charmed to find the cheerful home of the Bible Christian Mission,
consisting of Mr. and Mrs. Sam Pollard and two lady assistants,
one of whom is a countrywoman of my own. This is, I believe, the
most charming spot for a mission station in all China. Mr.
Pollard is quite a young man, full of enthusiasm, modest, and
clever. Everywhere he is received kindly; he is on friendly terms
with the officials and there is not a Chinese home within ten
miles of the city where he and his pretty wife are not gladly
welcomed. His knowledge of Chinese is exceptional; he is the best
Chinese scholar in Western China, and is examiner in Chinese for
the distant branches of the Inland Mission.</p>

<p>The mission in Tongchuan was opened in 1891, and the results
are not discouraging, seeing that the Chinaman is as difficult to
lead into the true path as any Jew. No native has been baptized
up to date. The convert employed by the mission as a native
helper, is one of the three converts of Chaotong. He is a
bright-faced lad of seventeen, as ardent an evangelist as heart
of missionary could desire, but a native preacher can never be so
successful as the foreign missionary. The Chinese listen to him
with complacency, "You eat Jesus's ric and of course you speak
his words," they say. The attitude of the Chinese in Tongchuan
towards the Christian missionary is one of perfect friendliness
towards the missionary, combined with perfect apathy towards his
religion. Like any other trader the missionary has a perfect
right to offer his goods, but he must not be surprised, the
Chinese thinks, if he finds difficulty in securing a purchaser
for wares as much inferior to the home production as is the
foreign barbarian to the subject of the Son of Heaven.</p>

<p>There is a Catholic Mission in Tongchuan, but the priest does
not associate with the Protestant. How indeed can the two
associate when they worship different Gods!</p>

<p>The difficulty is one which cannot be easily overcome while
there exists in China that bone of contention among missionaries
which is known as the "Term Question."</p>

<p>The Chinese recognise a supreme God, or are believed by some
to recognise a supreme God--"High Heaven's ruler" (<i>Shangtien
hou</i>), who is "probably intended," says Williams, "for the
true God." The Mohammedans, when they entered China, could not
recognise this god as identical with the only one God, to whom
they accordingly gave the Chinese name of "true Lord" (<i>Chen
Chu</i>). The Jesuits, when they entered China, could not
recognise either of these gods as identical with the God of the
Hebrews, whom they accordingly represented in Chinese first by
the characters for "Supreme Ruler" (<i>Shang ti</i>), and
subsequently by the characters for "Lord of Heaven" (<i>Tien
Chu</i>). The Protestants naturally could not be identified with
the Catholics, and invented another Chinese name, or other
Chinese names, for the true God; while the Americans, superior to
all other considerations, discovered a different name still for
the true God to whom they assigned the Chinese characters for
"the true Spirit" (<i>Chen Shen</i>), thereby suggesting by
implication, as Little observes, that the other spirits were
false. But, as if such divergent terms were not sufficiently
confusing for the Chinese, the Protestants themselves have still
more varied the Chinese characters for God.</p>

<p>Thus in the first translation of the Bible, the term for God
used is the Chinese character for "Spirit" (<i>Shen</i>); in the
second translation this term is rejected and "Supreme Ruler"
(<i>Shang ti</i>), substituted; the third translation reverts to
the "Spirit"; the fourth returns to the "Supreme Ruler"; and the
fifth, by Bishop Burdon of Hong Kong, and Dr. Blodget of Peking,
in 1884, rejects the title that was first accepted by the
Jesuits, and accepts the title "Lord of Heaven" (<i>Tien
Chu</i>), that was first rejected by the Jesuits.</p>

<p>"Many editions," says the Rev. J. Wherry, of Peking, "with
other terms have since been published." "Bible work in
particular," says the Rev. Mr. Muirhead, of Shanghai," is carried
on under no small disadvantage in view of this state of things."
"It is true, however," adds Mr. Muirhead, "that God has blest all
terms in spite of our incongruity." But obviously the Chinese are
a little puzzled to know which of the contending gods is most
worthy of their allegiance.</p>

<p>But apart from the "Term Question" there must be
irreconcilable antagonism between the two great missionary
churches in China, for it cannot be forgotten that "in the
development of the missionary idea three great tasks await the
(Protestant) Church. . . . The second task is to check the
schemes of the Jesuit. In the great work of the world's
evangelisation the Church has no foe at all comparable with the
Jesuit. . . Swayed ever by the vicious maxim that the end
justifies the means, he would fain put back the shadow of the
dial of human progress by half a dozen centuries. Other forms of
superstition and error are dangerous, but Jesuitism overtops them
all and stands forth an organised conspiracy against the
liberties of mankind. This foe is not likely to be overcome by a
divided Protestantism. If we would conquer in this war we must
move together, and in our movements must manifest a patience, a
heroism, a devotion equal to anything the Jesuit can claim." (The
Rev. A. Sutherland, D.D., Delegate from Canada to the Missionary
Conference, 1888, Records, i., 145.) And, on the other hand, the
distracted Chinese reads that:--"Protestantism is not only a
veritable Babel, but a horrible theory, and an immoral practice
which blasphemes God, degrades man, and endangers society."
(Cardinal Cuesta's Catechism cited in "China and Christianity,"
by Michie, p. 8.)</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI. THE CITY OF TONGCHUAN; WITH SOME REMARKS UPON
INFANTICIDE.</h3>

<p>When I entered Tongchuan the town was in commotion;
kettledrums and tomtoms were beating, and crackers and guns
firing; the din and clatter was continuous and deafening. An
eclipse of the sun was commencing--it was the 6th of April--"the
sun was being swallowed by the Dog of Heaven," and the noise was
to compel the monster to disgorge its prey. Five months ago the
Prefect of the city had been advised of the impending disaster,
and it was known that at a certain hour he would publicly
intervene with Heaven to avert from the city the calamity of
darkness. I myself saw with my own eyes the wonderful power of
this man. The sun was darkened when I went to the Prefect's
yamen. A crowd was already gathered in the court. At the foot of
the steps in the open air, a loosely built framework of wood ten
feet high was standing, displaying on its vertex a yellow disc of
paper inscribed with the characters for "voracity."</p>

<p>As we waited the sun became gradually clearer, when, just as
the moon was disappearing across its edge, the Prefect in full
dress, stepped from his yamen into the court, accompanied by the
city magistrate and a dozen city fathers. Every instrument of
discord was still clanging over the city. Then all these men of
weight walked solemnly three times round the scaffold, and halted
three times, while the Prefect went down on his knees, and did
obeisance with nine kotows to the rickety frame and its disc of
yellow paper. There was almost immediate answer to his prayer.
With a sigh of relief we saw the lingering remnant of darkness
disappear, and the midday sun shone full and bright. Then the
Prefect retired, his suite dividing to let him pass, and we all
went home blessing the good man whose intercession had saved the
town from darkness. For there can be little doubt, I hope, that
it is due to the action of this Prefect that the sun is shining
to-day in Tongchuan. The Chinese might well ask if any barbarian
missionary could do as he did.</p>

<p>Eclipses in China are foretold by the Government almanac
published annually in Peking by a bureau of astrology attached to
the Board of Rites. The almanac is a Government monopoly, and any
infraction of its copyright is a penal offence. "It monopolises
the management of the superstitions of the people, in regard to
the fortunate or unlucky conjunctions of each day and hour. No
one ventures to be without it, lest he be liable to the greatest
misfortunes and run the imminent hazard of undertaking important
events on blackballed days."</p>

<p>The Chinese almanac is much more comprehensive than ours, for
even eclipses are foretold that never happen. Should an error
take place in their almanac, and an expected eclipse not occur,
the royal astronomers are not disconcerted--far from it; they
discover in their error reason for rejoicing; they then
congratulate the Emperor that "the heavens have dispensed with
this omen of ill-luck in his favour." For eclipses forebode
disaster, and every thoughtful Chinaman who has heard of the
present rebellion of the Japanese must attribute the reverses
caused by the revolt to the eclipse of April 6th, occurring
immediately before the insurrection.</p>

<p>Tongchuan is one of the most charming towns I have ever
visited; it is probably the cleanest city in China, and the best
governed. Its prefect is a man of singular enlightenment, who
rules with a justice that is rarely known in China. His people
regard him as something more than mortal. Like Confucius "his ear
is an obedient organ for the reception of truth." Like the
Confucian Superior Man "his dignity separates him from the crowd;
being reverent he is beloved; being loyal he is submitted to; and
being faithful he is trusted. By his word he directs men, and by
his conduct he warns them."</p>

<p>For several years he was attached to the Embassy in Japan, and
he boasts that he has made Tongchuan as clean a city as any to be
found in the empire of the Mikado. The yamen is a model of
neatness. Painted on the outflanking wall there is the usual huge
representation of the fabulous monster attempting to swallow the
sun--the admonition against extortion--and probably the only
magistrate in China who does not stand in need of the warning is
the Prefect of Tongchuan.</p>

<p>Prices in Tongchuan at the time of my visit were high and food
was scarce. It was difficult to realise that men at that moment
were dying of starvation in the pretty town. Rice cost 400 cash
for the same quantity that in a good season can be bought for 60
cash; maize was 300 cash the sheng, whereas the normal price is
only 40 cash. Sugar was 15 cash the cake instead of 6 cash the
cake, and so on in all things. Poppy is not grown in the valley
to the same extent as hitherto, because poppy displaces wheat and
beans, and the people have need of all the land they can spare to
grow breadstuffs. In the other half of the year, rice, maize, and
tobacco are grown together on the plain, and at the same season
potatoes, oats, and buckwheat are grown in the hills.</p>

<p>Part of the plain is permanently under water, but it was the
drought in the winter and the rains in the summer of successive
years that caused the famine. There are no Mohammedans in the
town--there have been none since the rebellion--but there are
many small Mohammedan villages across the hills. No district in
China is now more peaceful than the Valley of Tongchuan. The
Yangtse River--"The River of Golden Sand "--is only two days
distant, but it is not navigable even by Chinese boatmen.
Sugarcane grows in the Yangtse Valley in little pockets, and it
is from there that the compressed cakes of brown sugar seen in
all the markets of Western Yunnan are brought. Coal comes from a
mine two or three days inland; white-wax trees provide an
important industry; the hills to the west contain the most
celebrated copper mines in the empire.</p>

<p>The cash of Tongchuan are very small and inferior, 2000 being
equivalent to one tael, whereas in Chaotong, 110 miles away, the
cash vary from 1260 to 1640 the tael. Before the present Prefect
took office the cash were more debased still, no less than 4000
being then counted as one tael, but the Prefect caused all these
cash to be withdrawn from circulation.</p>

<p>Unlike Chaotong, no children are permitted to be sold in the
city, but during last year no less than 3000 children (the
figures are again Chinese), were carried through the town on
their way from Chaotong to the capital. The edict of the Prefect
which forbids the selling of children increases the cases of
infanticide, and in time of famine there are few mothers among
the starving poor who can truthfully assert that they have never
abandoned any of their offspring.</p>

<p>The subject of infanticide in China has been discussed by a
legion of writers and observers; and the opinion they come to
seems to be generally that the prevalence of the crime, except in
seasons of famine, has been enormously overstated. The prevalent
idea with us Westerns appears to be, that the murder of their
children, especially of their female children, is a kind of
national pastime with the Chinese, or, at the best, a national
peculiarity. Yet it is open to question whether the crime,
excepting in seasons of famine, is, in proportion to the
population, more common in China than it is in England. H. A.
Giles of H.B.M. Chinese Consular Service, one of the greatest
living authorities on China, says "I am unable to believe that
infanticide prevails to any great extent in China. ... In times
of famine or rebellion, under stress of exceptional
circumstances, infanticide may possibly cast its shadow over the
empire, but as a general rule I believe it to be no more
practised in China than in England, France, the United States and
elsewhere." (Journal; China Branch R.A.S., 1885, p. 28.)</p>

<p>G. Eugene Simon, formerly French Consul in China, declares
that "infanticide is a good deal less frequent in China than in
Europe generally, and particularly in France." A statement that
inferentially receives the support of Dr. E. J. Eitel. (China
Review, xvi., 189.)</p>

<p>The prevailing impression as to the frequency of infanticide
in China is derived from the statements of missionaries, who, no
doubt unintentionally, exaggerate the prevalence of the crime in
order to bring home to us Westerns the deplorable condition of
the heathen among whom they are labouring. But, even among the
missionaries, the statements are as divergent as they are on
almost every other subject relating to China. Thus the Rev.
Griffith John argues "from his own experience that infanticide is
common all over the Empire," the Rev. Dr. Edkins on the other
hand says that "infanticide is a thing almost unknown in Peking."
And the well known medical missionary, Dr. Dudgeon of Peking (who
has left the London Mission), agrees with another medical
missionary, Dr. Lockhart, "that infanticide is almost as rare in
China as in England."</p>

<p>The Rev. A. H. Smith ("Chinese Characteristics," p. 207)
speaks "of the enormous infanticide which is known to exist in
China." The Rev. Justus Doolittle ("Social Life of the Chinese,"
ii. p. 203) asserts that "there are most indubitable reasons for
believing that infanticide is tolerated by the Government, and
that the subject is treated with indifference and with shocking
levity by the mass." . . . But Bishop Moule "has good reason to
conclude that the prevalence of the crime has been largely
exaggerated." (Journal, China Branch R.A.S., ut supra.)</p>

<p>One of the best known Consuls in China, who lately retired
from the Service, told the writer that in all his thirty years'
experience of China he had only had personal knowledge of one
authentic case of infanticide.</p>

<p>"Exaggerated estimates respecting the frequency of
infanticide," says the Rev. Dr. D. J. MacGowan, "are formed owing
to the withholding interment from children who die in infancy."
And he adds that "opinions of careful observers will be found to
vary with fields of observation."(China Review, xiv., 206.)</p>

<p>Whatever the relative frequency of infanticide in China and
Europe may be, it cannot, I think, admit of question that the
crime of infanticide is less common among the barbarian Chinese
than is the crime of foeticide among the highly civilised races
of Europe and America.</p>

<p>There are several temples in Tongchuan, and two beyond the
walls which are of more than ordinary interest. There is a Temple
to the Goddess of Mercy, where deep reverence is shown to the
images of the Trinity of Sisters. They are seated close into the
wall, the nimbus of glory which plays round their impassive
features being represented by a golden aureola painted on the
wall. The Goddess of Mercy is called by the Chinese "Sheng-mu,"
or Holy Mother, and it is this name which has been adopted by the
Roman Catholic Church as the Chinese name of the Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>There is a fine City Temple which controls the spirits of the
dead of the city as the yamens of the magistrates control the
living of the city. The Prefect and the City Magistrate are here
shown in their celestial abodes administering justice--or its
Chinese equivalent--to the spirits who, when living, were under
their jurisdiction on earth. They hold the same position in
Heaven and have the same authority as they had on earth; and may,
as spirits, be bribed to deal gently with the spirits of departed
friends just as, when living, they were open to offers to deal
leniently with any living prisoner in whose welfare the mends
were prepared to express practical sympathy.</p>

<p>In the Buddhist Temple are to be seen, in the long side
pavilions, the chambers of horrors with their realistic
representations of the torments of a soul in its passage through
the eight Buddhist hells. I looked on these scenes with the
calmness of an unbeliever; not so a poor woman to whom the
horrors were very vivid truths. She was on her knees before the
grating, sobbing piteously at a ghastly scene where a man, while
still alive, was being cast by monsters from a hill-top on to
red-hot spikes, there to be torn in pieces by serpents. This was
the torture her dead husband was now enduring; it was this stage
he had reached in his onward passage through hell--the priest had
told her so, and only money paid to the priests could lighten his
torment.</p>

<p>Beyond the south gate, amid groves of lofty pine trees, are
the temple and grounds, the pond and senior wrangler bridge, of
the Confucian Temple--the most beautifully-finished temple I have
seen in China. We have accustomed ourselves to speak in ecstacies
of the wood-carving in the temples of Japan, but not even in the
Shogun chapels of the Shiba temples in Tokyo have I seen
wood-carving superior to the exquisite delicacy of workmanship
displayed in the carving of the Imperial dragons that frame with
their fantastic coils the large Confucian tablet of this temple.
Money has been lavished on this building. The inclined marble
slabs that divide the terrace steps are covered with fanciful
tracery; the parapets of the bridge are chiselled in marble;
sculptured images of elephants with howdahs crown the pillars of
the marble balustrades; the lattice work under the wide eaves is
everywhere beautifully carved. Lofty pillars of wood support the
temple roofs. They are preserved by a coating of hemp and
protected against fire by an outer coating of plaster stained the
colour of the original wood. Gilding is used as freely in the
decoration of the grand altar and tablets of this temple, as it
is in a temple in Burma.</p>

<p>On a hill overlooking the city and valley is the Temple to the
God of Literature. The missionary and I climbed to the temple and
saw its pretty court, its ancient bronze censer, and its many
beautiful flowers, and then sat on the terrace in the sun and
watched the picturesque valley spread out before us.</p>

<p>As we descended the hill again, a lad, who had attached
himself to us, offered to show us the two common pits in which
are cast the dead bodies of paupers and criminals. The pits are
at the foot of the hill, open-mouthed in the uncut grass. With
famine in the city, with people dying at that very hour of
starvation, there was no lack of dead, and both pits were filled
to within a few feet of the surface. Bodies are thrown in here
without any covering, and hawks and crows strip them of their
flesh, a mode of treating the dead grateful to the Parsee, but
inexpressibly hateful to the Chinese, whose poverty must be
overwhelming when he can be found to permit it. Pigtails were
lying carelessly about and skulls separated from the trunk. Human
bones gnawed by dogs were to be picked up in numbers in the long
grass all round the hill; they were the bones of the dead who had
been loosely buried close to the surface, through which dogs--the
domestic dogs one met afterwards in the street--had scraped their
way. Many, too, were the bones of dead children; for poor
children are not buried, but are thrown outside the wall,
sometimes before they are dead, to be eaten perhaps by the very
dog that was their playmate since birth.</p>

<p>I called upon the French priest, Pere Maire, and he came with
much cordiality to the door of the mission to receive me. His is
a pretty mission, built in the Chinese style, with a modest
little church and a nice garden and summer-house. The father has
been four years in Tongchuan and ten in China. Like most ofthe
French priests in Chinahehas succeeded in growing a prodigious
beard whose imposing length adds to his influence among the
Chinese, who are apt to estimate age by the length of the beard.
Only three weeks ago he returned from the capital. Signs of
famine were everywhere apparent. The weather was very cold, and
the road in many places deeply covered with snow. Riding on his
mule he passed at different places on the wayside eight bodies,
all recently dead from hunger and cold. No school is attached to
the mission, but there is an orphelinat of little girls,
ramassees dans les rues, who had been cast away by their parents;
they are in charge of Chinese Catholic nuns, and will be reared
as nuns. As we sat in the pavilion in the garden and drank wine
sent to him by his brother in Bordeaux--true French wine--the
priest had many things to tell me of interest, of the native
rebellion on the frontier of Tonquin, of the mission of Monsieur
Haas to Chungking, and the Thibetan trade in tea. "The Chinese?
ah! yes. He loves the Chinese because he loves all God's
creatures, but they are liars and thieves. Many families are
converted, but even the Christians are never Christian till the
third generation." These were his words.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII. TONGCHUAN TO YUNNAN CITY.</h3>

<p>From Tongchuan to Yunnan city, the provincial seat of
Government and official residence of the Viceroy, whither I was
now bound, is a distance of two hundred miles. My two carriers
from Chaotong had been engaged to go with me only as far as
Tongchuan, but they now re-engaged to go with Laohwan, my third
man, as far as the capital. The conditions were that they were to
receive 6<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. each (2.25 taels), one tael
(3<i>s</i>.) to be paid in advance and the balance on arrival,
and they were to do the distance in seven days. The two taels
they asked the missionary to remit to their parents in Chaotong,
and he promised to receive the money from me and do so. There was
no written agreement of any kind--none of the three men could
read; they did not even see the money that the missionary was to
get for them; but they had absolute confidence in our good
faith.</p>

<p>I had a mule with me from Tongchuan to Yunnan, which saved me
many miles of walking, and increased my importance in the eyes of
the heathen. I was taking it to the capital for sale. It was a
big-boned rough-hewn animal, of superior intelligence, and I was
authorised to sell it, together with its saddle and bridle, for
four pounds. Like most Chinese mules it had two corns on the
forelegs, and thus could see at night. Every Chinaman knows that
the corns are adventitious eyes which give the mule this
remarkable power.</p>

<p>We were on our way early in the afternoon of the 7th going up
the valley. Below the curiously draped pagoda which commands
Tongchuan we met two pairs of prisoners who were being led into
the city under escort. They were coupled by the neck; they were
suffering cruelly, for their wrists were so tightly manacled that
their hands were strangulated, a mode of torture to which, it
will be remembered, the Chinese Government in 1860 subjected
Bowlby, the Times correspondent, and the other prisoners seized
with him "in treacherous violation of a flag of truce," till
death ended their sufferings. These men were roadside robbers
caught red-handed. Their punishment would be swift and certain.
Found guilty on their own confession, either tendered voluntarily
to escape torture, or under the compulsion of torture,
"self-accusation wrested from their agony," they would be
sentenced to death, carried in baskets without delay--if they had
not previously "died in prison"--died, that is, from the torture
having been pushed too far--to the execution ground, and there
beheaded.</p>

<p>We stopped at an inn that was not the ordinary stage, where in
consequence we had few comforts. In the morning my men lay in bed
till late, and when I called them they opened the door and
pointed to the road, clearly indicating that rain had fallen, and
that the roads were too slippery for traffic. But what was my
surprise on looking myself to find the whole country deeply under
snow, and that it was still snowing. All day, indeed, it snowed.
The track was very slippery, but my mule, though obstinate, was
sure-footed, and we kept going.</p>

<p>We passed a huge coffin--borne by a dozen men with every
gentleness, not to disturb the dead one's rest--preceded, not
followed, by mourners, two of whom were carrying a paper sedan
chair, which would be burnt, and so, rendered invisible, would be
sent to the invisible world to bear the dead man's spirit with
becoming dignity. All day we were in the mountains travelling up
the bed of a creek with mountains on both sides of us. We passed
Chehki, ninety li from Tongchuan, and thirty li further were glad
to escape from the cold and snow to the shelter of a poor
thatched mud inn, where we rested for the night.</p>

<p>A hump-back was in charge. The only bedroom was half open to
the sky, but the main room was still whole, though it had seen
better days. There was a shrine in this room with ancestral
tablets, and a sheet of many-featured gods, conspicuous amongst
them being the God of Riches, who had been little attentive to
the prayers offered him in this poor hamlet. In a stall adjoining
our bedroom the mule was housed, and jingled his bell
discontentedly all through the night. A poor man, nearly blind
with acute inflammation of the eyes, was shivering over the
scanty embers of an open fire which was burning in a square hole
scooped in the earthern floor near the doorway. He ate the
humblest dishful of maize husks and meal strainings. That night I
wondered did he sleep out in the open under a hedge, or did the
inn people give him shelter with my mule in the next room. My men
and I had to sleep in the same room. They were still on short
rations. They ate only twice a day, and then sparingly, of maize
and vegetables; they took but little rice, and no tea, and only a
very small allowance of pork once in two days. Food was very
dear, and, though they were receiving nearly double wages to
carry half-loads, they must needs be careful. What admirable
fellows they were! In all my wanderings I have never travelled
with more good-natured companions. The attendant Laohwan was a
powerful Chinese, solid and determined, but courteous in manner,
voluble of speech, but with an amusing stammer; he had a wide
experience of travel in Western China. He seemed to enjoy his
journey--he never appeared lovesick; but, of course, I had no
means of asking if he felt keenly the long separation from his
bride.</p>

<p>At the inn there was no bedding for my men; they had to cover
themselves, as best they could, with some pieces of felt brought
them by the hunchback, and sleep all huddled together from the
cold. They had a few hardships to put up with, but their lot was
a thousand times better than that of hundreds of their countrymen
who were dying from hunger as well as from cold.</p>

<p>On the 9th, as I was riding on my mule up the mountain road,
with the bleak, bare mountain tops on every side, I was watching
an eagle circling overhead, when my men called out to me
excitedly and pointed to a large wolf that leisurely crossed the
path in front of us and slunk over the brow. It had in its mouth
a haunch of flesh torn from some poor wretch who had perished
during the night. This was the only wolf I saw on my journey,
though they are numerous in the province. Last year, not twenty
li from Chaotong, a little girl of four, the only child of the
mission cook, was killed by a wolf in broad daylight before its
mother's eyes, while playing at the cabin door.</p>

<p>Again, to-day, I passed a humpbacked dwarf on the hills,
making his solitary way towards Tongchuan, and I afterwards saw
others, an indication of the prosperity that had left the
district, for in time of famine no child who was badly deformed
at birth would be suffered to live.</p>

<p>We stopped the night at Leitoupo, and next day from the bleak
tableland high among the mountains, where the wind whistled in
our faces, we gradually descended into a country of trees and
cultivation and fertility. We left the bare red hills behind us,
and came down into a beautiful glade, with pretty streams running
in pebbly beds past terraced banks. At a village among the trees,
where the houses made some pretension to comfort, and where
poppies with brilliantly coloured flowers, encroached upon the
street itself, we rested under a sunshade in front of a teahouse.
A pretty rill of mountain water ran our feet. Good tea was
brought us in new clean cups, and a sweetmeat of peanuts, set in
sugar-like almond toffee. The teahouse was filled. In the midst
of the tea drinkers a man was lying curled on a mat, a bent elbow
his pillow, and fast asleep, with the opium pipe still beside
him, and the lamp still lit. A pretty little girl from the
adjoining cottage came shyly out to see me. I called her to me
and gave her some sweetmeat. I wished to put it in her mouth but
she would not let me, and ran off indoors. I looked into the room
after her and saw her father take the lolly from her and give it
to her fat little baby brother, who seemed the best fed urchin in
the town. But I stood by and saw justice done, and saw the little
maid of four enjoy the first luxury of her life-time. Girls in
China early learn that they are, at best, only necessary evils,
to be endured, as tradition says Confucius taught, only as the
possible mothers of men. Yet the condition of women in China is
far superior to that in any other heathen country, Monogamy is
the rule in China, polygamy is the exception, being confined to
the three classes, the rich, the officials, and those who can by
effort afford to take a secondary wife, their first wife having
failed to give birth to a son.</p>

<p>It is impossible to read the combined experiences of many
missionaries and travellers in China without forming the opinion
that the condition of women in China is as nearly satisfactory as
could be hoped for, in a kingdom of "civilised and organised
heathenism," as the Rev. C. W. Mateer terms it. The lot of the
average Chinese woman is certainly not one that a Western woman
need envy. She cannot enjoy the happiness which a Western woman
does, but she is happy in her own way nevertheless. "Happiness
does not always consist in absolute enjoyment--but in the idea
which we have formed of it."</p>

<p>There was no impertinent curiosity to see the stranger. The
people in Yunnan seem cowed and crushed. That arrogance which
characterises the Chinese elsewhere is entirely wanting here.
They have seen the horrors of rebellion and civil war, of battle,
murder and sudden death, of devastation by the sword, famine,
ruin, and misery. They are resigned and spiritless. But their
friendliness is charming; their courtesy and kindliness is a
constant delight to the traveller. At meal time you are always
pressed to join the table in the same manner, and with the
identical phrases still used by the Spaniards, but the request is
one of politeness only, and like the "<i>quiere Vd. gustar?</i>"
is not meant to be accepted.</p>

<p>We continued on our way. Comparatively few coolies now met us,
and the majority of those who did were travelling empty-handed;
but there were many ponies and mules coming from the capital,
laden with tea and with blocks of white salt like marble. Every
here and there a rude shelter was erected by the wayside, where a
dish of cabbage and herbs could be obtained, which you ate out of
cracked dishes at an improvised bench made from a coffin board
resting on two stones. Towards sundown we entered the village of
Kong-shan, a pretty place on the hill slope, with views across a
fertile hollow that was pleasant to see. Here we found an
excellent inn with good quarters. Our day's journey was
thirty-seven miles, of which I walked fifteen miles and rode
twenty-two miles. We were travelling quickly. Distances in China
are, at first, very confusing. They differ from ours in a very
important particular: they are not fixed quantities; they vary in
length according to the nature of the ground passed over.
Inequalities increase the distance; thus it by no means follows
that the distance from A to B is equal to the distance from B to
A--it may be fifty per cent, or one hundred per cent, longer. The
explanation is simple. Distance is estimated by time, and,
speaking roughly, ten li (3.33 miles) is the unit of distance
equivalent to an hour's journey. "Sixty li still to go" means six
hours' journey before you; it may be uphill all the way. If you
are returning downhill you need not be surprised to learn that
the distance by the same road is only thirty li.</p>

<p>To-night before turning in I looked in to see how my mule was
faring. He was standing in a crib at the foot of some underground
stairs, with a huge horse trough before him, the size and shape
of a Chinese coffin. He was peaceful and meditative. When he saw
me he looked reproachfully at the cut straw heaped untidily in
the trough, and then at me, and asked as clearly as he could if
that was a reasonable ration for a high-spirited mule, who had
carried my honourable person up hill and down dale over steep
rocks and by tortuous paths, a long spring day in a warm sun.
Alas, I had nothing else to offer him, unless I gave him the
uncut straw that was stitched into our paillasses. What straw was
before him was Chinese chaff, cut into three-inch lengths, by a
long knife worked on a pivot and board, like the tobacco knife of
civilisation. And he had to be content with that or nothing.</p>

<p>Next day we had an early start soon after sunrise. It was a
lovely day with a gentle breeze blowing and a cloudless sky. The
village of Kongshan was a very pretty place. It was built chiefly
on two sides of a main road which was as rugged as the dry bed of
a mountain creek. The houses were better and the inns were again
provided with heaps of bedding at the doorways. Advertisement
bills in blue and red were displayed on the lintels and
doorposts, while fierce door-gods guarded against the admission
of evil spirits. Brave indeed must be the spirits who venture
within reach of such fierce bearded monsters, armed with such
desperate weapons, as were here represented. I stood on the edge
of the town overlooking the valley while my mule was being
saddled. Patches of wheat and beans were scattered among fields
of white-flowered poppy. Coolies carrying double buckets of water
were winding up the sinuous path from the border of the garden
where "a pebbled brook laughs upon its way." Boys were shouting
to frighten away the sparrows from the newly-sown rice beds;
while women were moving on their little feet among the poppies,
scoring anew the capsules and gathering the juice that had exuded
since yesterday. Down the road coolies were filing laden with
their heavy burdens--a long day's toil before them; rude carts
were lumbering past me drawn by oxen and jolting on wheels that
were solid but not circular. Then the mule was brought to me, and
we went on through an avenue of trees that were half hidden in
showers of white roses, by hedges of roses in full bloom and
wayside flowers, daisies and violets, dandelions and
forget-me-nots, a pretty sight all fresh and sparkling in the
morning sun.</p>

<p>We went on in single file, my two coolies first with their
light loads that swung easily from their shoulders, then myself
on the mule and last my stalwart attendant Laohwan with his
superior dress, his huge sun hat, his long pipe, and umbrella. A
man of unusual endurance was Laohwan. The day's journey done--he
always arrived the freshest of the party--he had to get ready my
supper, make my bed, and look after my mule. He was always the
last to bed and the first to rise. Long before daybreak he was
about again, attending to the mule and preparing my porridge and
eggs for breakfast. He thought I liked my eggs hard, and each
morning construed my look of remonstrance into one of
approbation. It is very true of the Chinaman that precedent
determines his action. The first morning Laohwan boiled the eggs
hard and I could not reprove him. Afterwards of course he made a
point of serving me the eggs every morning in the same way. I
could say in Chinese "I don't like them," but the morning I said
so Laohwan applied my dislike to the eggs not to their condition
of cooking, and saying in Chinese "good, good," he obligingly ate
them for me.</p>

<p>Leaving the valley we ascended the red incline to an open
tableland, where the soil is arid, and yields but a reluctant and
scanty harvest. Nothing obstructs the view and you can see long
distances over the downs, which are bereft of all timber except
an occasional clump of pines that the axe has spared because of
the beneficial influence the geomancers declare they exercise
over the neighbourhood. The roadway in places is cut deeply into
the ground; for the path worn by the attrition of countless feet
soon becomes a waterchannel, and the roadway in the rains is
often the bed of a rapid stream. At short intervals are vast
numbers of grave mounds with tablets and arched gables of well
dressed stone. No habitations of the living are within miles of
them, a forcible illustration of the devastation that has ravaged
the district. This was still the famine district. In the open
uncultivated fields women were searching for weeds and herbs to
save them from starvation till the ingathering of the winter
harvest. Their children it was pitiful to see. It is rare for
Australians to see children dying of hunger. These poor
creatures, with their pinched faces and fleshless bones, were
like the patient with typhoid fever who has long been hovering
between life and death. There were no beggars. All the beggars
were dead long ago. All through the famine district we were not
once solicited for either food or money, but those who were still
living were crying for alms with silent voices a hundred times
more appealing. When we rested to have tea the poor children
gathered round to see us, skeletons dressed in skins and rags,
yet meekly independent and friendly. Their parents were covered
with ragged garments that hardly held together. Many wore over
their shoulders rude grass cloths made from pine fibre that
appear to be identical with the native petticoats worn by the
women of New Guinea.</p>

<p>Leaving the poor upland behind us, we descended to a broad and
fertile plain where the travelling was easy, and passed the night
in a large Moslem inn in the town of Iangkai.</p>

<p>All next day we pursued our way through fertile fields flanked
by pretty hills, which it was hard to realise were the peaks of
mountains 10,000 to 11,000 feet above sea-level. Before sundown
we reached the prosperous market town of Yanglin, where I had a
clean upstairs room in an excellent inn The wall of my bedroom
was scrawled over in Chinese characters with what I was told were
facetious remarks by Chinese tourists on the quality of the
fare.</p>

<p>In the evening my mule was sick, Laohwan said, and a
veterinary surgeon had to be sent for. He came with unbecoming
expedition. Then in the same way that I have seen the Chinese
doctors in Australia diagnose the ailments of their human
patients of the same great family, he examined the poor mule with
the inscrutable air of one to whom are unveiled the mysteries of
futurity, and he retired with his fee. The medicine came later in
a large basket, and consisted of an assortment of herbs so varied
that one at least might be expected to hit the mark. My Laohwan
paid the mule doctor, so he said, for advice and medicine 360
cash (ninepence), an exorbitant charge as prices are in
China.</p>

<p>On Friday, April 13th, we had another pleasant day in open
country, leading to the low rim of hills that border the plain
and lake of Yunnan city. Ruins everywhere testify to the march of
the rebellion of thirty years ago--triumphal arches in fragments,
broken temples, battered idols destroyed by Mohammedan
iconoclasts. Districts destitute of habitations, where a thriving
population once lived, attest that suppression of a rebellion in
China spells extermination to the rebels.</p>

<p>On the road I met a case of goitre, and by-and-by others, till
I counted twenty or more, and then remembered that I was now
entering on a district of Asia extending over Western Yunnan into
Thibet, Burma, the Shan States, and Siam, the prevailing
deformity of whose people is goitre.</p>

<p>Ten miles before Yunnan my men led me off the road to a fine
building among the poplars, which a large monogram on the gateway
told me was the Catholic College of the <i>Missions Etrangeres de
Paris</i>, known throughout the Province as Jinmaasuh. Situated
on rising ground, the plain of Yunnan widening before it, the
College commands a distant view of the walls and turretted
gateways, the pagodas and lofty temples of the famous city.
Chinese students are trained here for the priesthood. At the time
of my visit there were thirty students in residence, who, after
their ordination, will be scattered as evangelists throughout the
Province. Pere Excoffier was at home, and received me with
characteristic courtesy. His news was many weeks later than mine.
M. Gladstone had retired from the Premiership, and M. Rosebery
was his successor. England had determined to renew the payment of
the tribute which China formerly exacted by right of suzerainty
from Burma. The Chinese were daily expecting the arrival of two
white elephants from Burma, which were coming in charge of the
British Resident in Singai (Bhamo), M. Warry, as a present to the
Emperor, and were the official recognition by England that Burma
is still a tributary of the Middle Kingdom. I may here say that I
often heard of this tribute in Western China. The Chinese had
been long waiting for the arrival of the elephants, with their
yellow flags floating from the howdahs, announcing, as did the
flags of Lord Macartney's Mission to Peking, "Tribute from the
English to the Emperor of China," and I suppose that there are
governments idiotic enough to thus pander to Chinese arrogance.
No doubt what has given rise to the report is the knowledge that
the Government of India is bound, under the Convention of 1886,
to send, every ten years, a complimentary mission from the Chief
Commissioner of Burma to the Viceroy of Yunnan.</p>

<p><b>THE BIG EAST GATE OF YUNNAN CITY</b></p>
</center>

<p>It was late when I left Jinmaasuh, and long after sundown
before I reached the city. The flagged causeway across the plain
was slippery to walk on, and my mule would not agree with me that
there was any need to hurry. He knew the Chinese character better
than I did. Gunfire, the signal for the closing of the gates, had
sounded when we were two miles from the wall; but sentries are
negligent in China and the gates were still open. Had we been
earlier we should have entered by the south gate, which is always
the most important of the gates of a Chinese city, and the one
through which all officials make their official entry; but,
unable to do this, we entered by the big east gate. Turning
sharply to the right along the city wall we were conducted in a
few minutes to the Telegraph Offices, where I received a cordial
welcome from Mr. Christian Jensen, the superintendent of
telegraphs in the two great provinces of Yunnan and Kweichow.
These are his headquarters, and here I was to rest a delightful
week. It was a pleasant change from silence to speech, from
Chinese discomfort to European civilisation. Chinese fare one
evening, pork, rice, tea, and beans; and the next, chicken and
the famed Shuenwei ham, mutton and green peas and red currant
jelly, pancakes and aboriginal Yunnan cheese, claret, champagne,
port, and cordial Medoc.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII. ATYUNNAN CITY.</h3>

<p>Yunnan city is one of the great cities of China, not so much
in size as in importance. It is within easy access at all seasons
of the year of the French colony of Tonquin, whereas the trade
route from here to British Burma is long, arduous, and
mountainous, and in its Western portions is closed to traffic
during the rains. From Yunnan City to Mungtze on the borders of
Tonquin, where there is a branch of the Imperial Maritime Customs
of China, is a journey of eight days over an easy road. Four days
from Mungtze is Laokai on the Red River, a river which is
navigable by boat or steamer to Hanoi, the chief river port of
Tonquin. In the middle of 1889 the French river steamer, <i>Le
Laokai</i>, made the voyage from Hanoi to Laokai in sixty
hours.</p>

<p>From Yunnan City to Bhamo on the Irrawaddy, in British Burma,
is a difficult journey of thirty-three stages over a mountainous
road which can never by any human possibility be made available
for other traffic than caravans of horses or coolies on foot. The
natural highway of Central and Southern Yunnan is by Tonquin, and
no artificial means can ever alter it. At present Eastern Yunnan
sends her trade through the provinces of Kweichow and Hunan to
the Yangtse above Hankow, or via the two Kuangs to Canton.
Shortness of distance, combined with facility of transport, must
soon tap this trade or divert it into the highways of Tonquin.
Northern Yunnan must send her produce and receive her imports,
via Szechuen and the Yangtse. As for the trade of Szechuen, the
richest of the provinces of China, no man can venture to assert
that any other trade route exists, or can ever be made to exist,
than the River Yangtse; and all the French Commissioners in the
world can no more alter the natural course of this trade than
they can change the channel of the Yangtse itself.</p>

<p>I am not, of course, the first distinguished visitor who has
been in Yunnan City. Marco Polo was here in 1283, and has left on
record a description of the city, which, in his time, was known
by the name of Yachi. Jesuit missionaries have been propagating
the faith in the province since the seventeenth century. But the
distinction of being the first European traveller, not a
missionary priest, to visit the city since the time of Marco Polo
rests with Captain Doudart de la Gree of the French Navy, who was
here in 1867.</p>

<p>Margary, the British Consul, who met a cruel death at Manwyne,
passed through Yunnan in 1875 on his famous journey from Hankow;
and two years later the tardy mission under Grosvenor, with the
brilliant Baber as interpreter, and Li Han Chang, the brother of
Li Hung Chang, as delegate for the Chinese, arrived here in the
barren hope of bringing his murderers to justice.</p>

<p>Hosie, formerly H.B.M. Consul in Chung-king, and well known as
a traveller in Western China, was in Yunnan City in 1882.</p>

<p>In September, 1890, Bonvalot and Prince Henri d'Orleans
stopped here at the French Mission on their way to Mungtze in
Tonquin. It was on the completion of their journey along the
eastern edge of Tibet Inconnu--"Unknown Thibet!" as they term it,
although the whole route had been traversed time and again by
missionary priests, a journey whose success was due--though few
have ever heard his name--to its true leader, interpreter, and
guide, the brave Dutch priest from Kuldja, Pere Dedeken.</p>

<p>Another famous missionary traveller, Pere Vial, who led
Colquhoun out of his difficulty in that journey "Across Chryse,"
which Colquhoun describes as a "Journey of Exploration" (though
it was through a country that had been explored and accurately
mapped a century and a half before by Jesuit missionaries), and
conducted him in safety to Bhamo in Burma, has often been in
Yunnan City, and is a possible successor to the Bishopric.</p>

<p>M. Boell, who left the Secretaryship of the French Legation in
Peking to become the special correspondent of Le Temps, was here
in 1892 on his way from Kweiyang, in Kweichow, to Tonquin, and a
few months later Captain d'Amade, the Military Secretary of the
French Legation, completed a similar journey from Chungking. In
May, 1892, the Commissioner from the French Government opium farm
in Hanoi, M. Tomme, arrived in Yunnan City from Mungtze, sent by
his Government in search of improved methods of poppy
cultivation--the Yunnan opium, with the exception of the Shansi
opium, being probably the finest in China. Finally, in May, 1893,
Lenz, the American bicyclist, to the profound amazement of the
populace, rode on his "living wheel" to the Yesutang. This was
the most remarkable journey of all. Lenz practically walked
across China, surmounting hardships and dangers that few men
would venture to face. I often heard of him. He stayed at the
mission stations. All the missionaries praise his courage and
endurance, and the admirable good humour with which he endured
every discomfort. But one missionary lamented to me that Lenz did
not possess that close acquaintance with the Bible which was to
be expected of a man of his hardihood. It seems that at family
prayers at this good missionary's, the chapter for reading was
given out when poor Lenz was discovered feverishly seeking the
Epistle to the Galatians in the Old Testament. When his mistake
was gently pointed out to him he was not discouraged, far from
it; it was the missionary who was dismayed to hear that in the
United States this particular Epistle is always reckoned a part
of the Pentateuch.</p>

<p>I paid an early visit of courtesy to my nominal host, Li Pi
Chang, the Chinese manager of the Telegraphs. He received me in
his private office, gave me the best seat on the left, and handed
me tea with his own fat hands. A mandarin whose rank is above
that of an expectant Taotai, Li is to be the next Taotai of
Mungtze, where, from an official salary of 400 taels per annum,
he hopes to save from 10,000 to 20,000 taels per annum.</p>

<p>"Squeezing," as this method of enrichment is termed, is, you
see, not confined to America. Few arts, indeed, seem to be more
widely distributed than the art of squeezing. "Dives, the
tax-dodger," is as common in China as he is in the United States.
Compare, however, any city in China, in the midst of the most
ancient civilisation in the world, with a city like Chicago,
which claims to have reached the highest development of modern
civilisation, and it would be difficult to assert that the
condition of public morals in the heathen city was even
comparable with the corruption and sin of the American city, a
city "nominally Christian, which is studded with churches and
littered with Bibles," but still a city "where perjury is a
protected industry." No community is more ardent in its
evangelisation of the "perishing Chinese" than Chicago, but where
in all China is there "such a supreme embodiment of fraud,
falsehood, and injustice," as prevails in Chicago? An alderman in
Chicago, Mr. Stead tells us (p. 172 et seq.) receives only 156
dollars a year salary; but, in addition to his salary, he enjoys
"practically unrestricted liberty to fill his pockets by
bartering away the property of the city." "It is expected of the
alderman, as a fundamental principle, that he will steal," and,
in a fruitful year, says the <i>Record</i>, the average crooked
alderman makes 15,000 to 20,000 dollars. An assessorship in
Chicago is worth nominally 1500 dollars per annum, but "everyone
knows that in Chicago an assessorship is the shortest cut to
fortune."</p>

<p>Squeezing in China may be common, but it is a humble industry
compared with the monumental swindling which Mr-Stead describes
as existing in Chicago.</p>

<p>Besides being manager in Yunnan City, Li is the chief
telegraph director of the two provinces of Yunnan and Kweichow.
That he is entirely innocent of all knowledge of telegraphy, or
of the management of telegraphs, is no bar to such an
appointment. He is a mandarin, and is, therefore, presumably
fitted to take any position whatever, whether it be that of
Magistrate or Admiral of the Fleet, Collector of Customs, or
General commanding in the field. Of the mandarin in China it is
truly said that "there is nothing he isn't."</p>

<p>Li is also Chief Secretary of the <i>Shan-hao-Tsung-Kuh</i>,
"The Supreme Board of Reorganisation" of the province, the
members of which are the four highest provincial officials next
below the Governor (<i>Futai</i>)--viz., the Treasurer
(<i>Fantai</i>), Provincial Judge (<i>Niehtai</i>), the Salt
Comptroller, and the Grain Intendant.</p>

<p>Li, it may be said at once, is a man of no common virtue. He
is the father of seven sons and four daughters; he can die in
peace; in his family there is no fear of the early extinction of
male descendants, for the succession is as well provided against
as it is in the most fertile Royal family in Europe. His family
is far spreading, and it is worth noting as an instance of the
patriarchal nature of the family in China, that Li is regarded as
the father of a family, whose members dependent upon him for
entire or partial support number eighty persons. He has had three
wives. His number one wife still lives at the family seat in
Changsha; another secondary wife is dead; his present number two
wife lives with him in Yunnan. This is his favourite wife, and
her story is worth a passing note. She was not a "funded houri,"
but a poor <i>yatow</i>, a "forked head" or slave girl, whom he
purchased on a lucky day, and, smitten with her charms, made her
his wife. It was a case of love at first sight. Her conduct since
marriage has more than justified the choice of her master. Still
a young woman, she has already presented her lord with nine
children, on the last occasion surpassing herself by giving birth
to twins. She has a most pleasant face, and really charming
children; but the chief attraction of a Chinese lady is absent in
her case. Her feet are of natural size, and not even in the
exaggerated murmurings of love could her husband describe them as
"three-inch gold lilies."</p>

<p>That this was a marriage of inclination there can be no doubt
whatever. It is idle to argue that the Chinese are an unemotional
people, incapable of feeling the same passions that move us. We
ridicule the image of a Chinaman languishing in love, just as the
Chinaman derides the possibility of experiencing the feelings of
love for the average foreign woman he has seen in China. Their
poetry abounds in love episodes. Students of Chinese civilisation
seem to agree that a <i>mariage de convenance</i> in China is
more likely even than on the Continent to become instantly a
marriage of affection. The pleasures of female society are almost
denied the Chinaman; he cannot fall in love before marriage
because of the absence of an object for his love. "The faculty of
love produces a subjective ideal; and craves for a corresponding
objective reality. And the longer the absence of the objective
reality, the higher the ideal becomes; as in the mind of the
hungry man ideal foods get more and more exquisite."</p>

<p>In Meadows' "Essay on Civilisation in China," there is a
charming story, translated from the Chinese, of love at first
sight, given in illustration of the author's contention that "it
is the men to whom women's society is almost unknown that are
most apt to fall violently in love at first sight. Violent love
at first sight is a general characteristic of nations where the
sexes have no intercourse before marriage. . . . The starved
cravings of love devour the first object":--</p>

<p>"A Chinese who had suffered bitter disenchantments in marriage
retired with his infant son to the solitude of a mountain
inaccessible for little-footed Chinese women. He trained up the
youth to worship the gods and stand in awe and abhorrence of
devils, but he never mentioned even the name of woman to him. He
always descended to market alone, but when he grew old and feeble
he was at length compelled to take the young man with him to
carry the heavy bag of rice." He very reasonably argued, "I shall
always accompany my son, and take care that if he does see a
woman by chance, he shall never speak to one; he is very
obedient; he has never heard of woman; he does not know what they
are; and as he has lived in that way for twenty years already, he
is, of course, now pretty safe."</p>

<p>"As they were on the first occasion leaving the market town
together, the son suddenly stopped short, and, pointing to three
approaching objects, inquired: 'Father, what are these things?
Look! look! what are they?' The father hastily answered: 'Turn
away your head. They are devils.' The son, in some alarm,
instantly turned away from things so bad, and which were gazing
at his motions with surprise from under their fans. He walked to
the mountain top in silence, ate no supper, and from that day
lost his appetite and was afflicted with melancholy. For some
time his anxious and puzzled parent could get no satisfactory
answer to his inquiries; but at length the poor young man burst
out, almost crying from an inexplicable pain: 'Oh, father, that
tallest devil! that tallest devil, father!'"</p>

<p>Girls for Yunnan City are bought at two chief centres--at
Chaotong, as we have seen, and at Bichih. They are carried to the
city in baskets. They are rarely sold into prostitution, but are
bought as slave girls for domestic service, as concubines, and
occasionally as wives. Their great merit is the absence of the
"thick-neck," goitre.</p>

<p>The morning after my visit, Li sent me his card, together with
a leg of mutton and a pile of sweet cakes. I returned my card,
and gave the bearer 200 cash (fivepence), not as a return gift to
the mandarin, but as a private act of generosity to his
servant--all this being in accordance with Chinese etiquette.</p>

<p>My host in Yunnan, and the actual manager and super-intendent
of the telegraphs of the two provinces, is a clever Danish
gentleman, Mr. Christian Jensen, an accomplished linguist, to
whom every European resident and traveller in the province is
indebted for a thousand acts of kindness and attention. He has a
rare knowledge of travel in China. Mr. Jensen arrived in China in
1880 in the service of the Great Northern Telegraph Company--a
Danish company. From December, 1881, when the first Chinese
telegraph line was opened (that from Shanghai to Tientsin), till
the spring of 1883, he was one of eight operatives and engineers
lent by the Company to the Chinese Government. In December, 1883,
having returned in the meantime to the Great Northern, he
accepted an engagement under the Imperial Government, and he has
been in their employ ever since. During this time he has
superintended the construction of 7000 li (2350 miles) of
telegraph lines, and it was he who, on the 20th May, 1890,
effected the junction of the Chinese system with the French lines
at Laokai. Among the more important lines constructed by him are
those joining the two capital cities of the provinces of Yunnan
and Kweichow; that from Yunnan City to Mungtze, on the frontier
of Tonquin; that from Canton to the boundary of Fuhkien province;
and that from Yunnan City through Tali to Tengyueh (Momein), this
last line being the one which will eventually unite with the
marvellous Indian telegraph system at the Burmese frontier. In
the course of his many journeys through China, Mr. Jensen has
been invariably well treated by the Chinese, and it is pleasant
to hear one who has seen so much of the inner life of the country
speak as he does of the universal courtesy and hospitality,
attention, and kindness that has been shown him by all classes of
Chinese from the highest officials to the humblest coolies.</p>

<p><b>VIEW IN YUNNAN CITY</b></p>
</center>

<p>Many interesting episodes have marked his stay in China. Once,
when repairing the line from Pase, in Kwangsi, to Mungtze, during
the rainy season of 1889, fifty-six out of sixty men employed by
him died of what there can be little doubt was the same plague
that has lately devastated Hong Kong. On this occasion of twelve
men who at different times were employed as his chair-bearers,
all died.</p>

<p>In October, 1886, he came to Yunnan City, and made this his
headquarters. He has always enjoyed good health.</p>

<p>One of the chief difficulties that formerly impeded the
extension of the telegraph in China was the belief that the
telegraph poles spoil the "<i>fungshui</i>"--in other words, that
they divert good luck from the districts they pass through. This
objection has been everywhere overcome. It last revealed itself
in the extreme west of the line from Yunnan. Villagers who saw in
the telegraph a menace to the good fortune of their district
would cut down the poles--and sell the wire in compensation for
their trouble. The annoyance had to be put a stop to. An
energetic magistrate took the matter in hand. He issued a warning
to the villagers, but his warning was unheeded. Then he took more
vigorous measures. The very next case that occurred he had two
men arrested, and charged with the offence. They were probably
innocent, but under the persuasion of the bamboo they were
induced to acquiesce in the magistrate's opinion as to their
guilt. They were sentenced to be deprived of their ears, and then
they were sent on foot, that all might see them, under escort
along the line from Yunnan City to Tengyueh and back again. No
poles have been cut down since.</p>

<h3>CHAPTERX IV. GOLD, BANKS, AND TELEGRAPHS IN YUNNAN.</h3>

<p>Yunnan City is the great gold emporium of China, for most of
the gold found in China comes from the province of which it is
the capital. When a rich Chinaman returns from Yunnan to another
province, or is summoned on a visit to the Emperor at Peking, he
carries his money in gold not silver. Gold leaf sent from Yunnan
gilds the gods of Thibet and the temples and pagodas of
Indo-China. No caravan returns to Burma from Western China whose
spare silver has not been changed into gold leaf. In the Arracan
Temple in Mandalay, as in the Shway-dagon Pagoda in Rangoon, you
see the gold leaf that Yunnan produces, and in the future will
produce in infinitely greater quantities.</p>

<p>Gold comes chiefly from the mines of Talang, eighteen days
journey by land S.W. from Yunnan City, on the confines of the
district which produces the famous Puerh tea. The yield must be a
rich one despite the ineffective appliances that are employed in
its extraction. Gold has always been abundant in this province;
at the time of Marco Polo's visit it was so abundant that its
value in relation to silver was only as one to six.</p>

<p>When gold is worth in Shanghai 35 times its weight in silver,
it may be bought in Yunnan City or Talifu for from 25 to 27.5
times its weight in silver, and in quantities up to hundreds of
ounces. To remit silver by telegraphic transfer from Shanghai or
Hong Kong to Yunnan city costs six per cent., and either of the
two leading banks in the city will negotiate the transfer from
their agents at the seaports of any amount up to 10,000 ounces of
silver in a single transaction. The gold can always be readily
sold in Shanghai or Hong Kong, and the only risk is in the
carriage of the gold from the inland city to the seaport. So far
as I could learn, no gold thus sent has gone astray. It is
carried overland by the fastest trade route--that through Mungtze
to Laokai--and thence by boat down stream to Hanoi in Tonquin,
from which port it is sent by registered post to Saigon and Hong
Kong. Here then is a venture open to all, with excitement
sufficient for the most <i>blase</i> speculator. Ample profits
are made by the dealer. For instance, a large quantity of gold
was purchased in Yunnan city on the 21st January, 1894, at 23.2,
its value in Shanghai on the same date being 30.9; but on the
date that the gold arrived in Shanghai its value had risen to 35,
at which price it was sold. At the time of my visit gold was 25.5
to 27 in Yunnan, and 35 in Shanghai, and I have since learnt
that, while gold has become cheaper in the province, it has
become dearer at the seaport.</p>

<p>The gold is brought to the buyer in the form of jewellery of
really exquisite workmanship, of rings and bracelets, earrings
and head ornaments, of those tiny images worn by rich children in
a half circlet over the forehead, and bridal charms that would
make covetous the heart of a nun. Ornaments of gold such as these
are 98 per cent, fine and are sold, weighed on the same scales,
for so many times their weight in silver. They are sold not
because of the poverty of their owners, but because their owners
make a very large profit on their original cost by so disposing
of them. If, however, the purchaser prefer it, gold will be
brought him in the leaf 99 per cent, fine, and this is
undoubtedly the best form into which to convert your silver. The
gold beaters of Yunnan are a recognised class, and are so
numerous that they have a powerful guild or trade's union of
their own.</p>

<p>Gold-testing is also a recognised profession, but the methods
are primitive and require the skill of an expert, consisting, as
they do, of a comparison of the rubbing on a stone of the unknown
gold, with a similar rubbing of gold whose standard has been
accurately determined. One of the best gold-testers in the city
has been taught electric gilding by Mr. Jensen and does some
skilful work.</p>

<p>The principle of self-protection restrains the Chinaman from
the ostentatious exhibition of his wealth--he fears being
squeezed by the officials who are apt to regard wealth as an
aggravation of crime, to be the more severely punished the better
able is the accused to purchase exemption from punishment. I have
seen a stranger come into the room where Mr. Jensen and I were
sitting, who from his appearance seemed to be worth perhaps a
five-dollar bill, and after a preliminary interchange of
compliments, I have seen his hand disappear up his long sleeve
and produce a package of gold leaf worth perhaps 2000 taels of
silver. This he would offer for sale; there was some quiet
bargaining; when, should they agree, the gold was weighed, the
purchaser handed a cheque on his Chinese banker for the amount in
silver, and the transaction was finished as quickly and neatly as
if it had taken place in Bond Street, and not in the most inland
capital of an "uncivilized country"; whose civilization has
nevertheless kept it intact and mighty since the dawn of history,
and whose banking methods are the same now as they were in the
days of Solomon.</p>

<p>The silver of Yunnan is of the same standard as the silver of
Shanghai, namely 98 per cent, pure, and differs to the eye from
the absolutely unalloyed silver of Szechuen.</p>

<p>The cash of Yunnan vary in a way that is more than usually
bewildering. Let me explain, in a few sentences, the "cash"
currency of the Middle Kingdom. The current coin of China as
everyone knows is the brass cash, which is perforated so that it
may be carried on a string. Now, theoretically, a "string of
cash" contains 100 coins, and in the Eastern provinces ten
strings are the theoretical equivalent of one Mexican dollar. But
there are eighteen provinces in China, and the number of brass
cash passing for a string varies in each province from the full
100, which I have never seen, to 83 in Taiyuen, and down to 33 in
the Eastern part of the province of Chihli. In Peking I found the
system charmingly simple. One thousand cash are there represented
by 100 coins, whereas 1000 "old cash" consist of 1000 coins,
though 1000 "capital cash" are only 500 coins. The big cash are
marked as 10 capital cash, but count the same as 5 old cash.
Nowhere does a Chinaman mean 1000 cash when he speaks of 1000
cash. In Tientsin 1000 cash means 500 cash--that is to say 5
times 100 cash, the 100 there being any number you can pass
except 100, though by agreement the 100 is usually estimated at
98. In Nanking I found a different system to prevail. There cash
are 1075 the 1000, but of the 10 strings of 100 cash, 7 contain
only 98 cash each, and 3 only 95, yet the surplus 75 cash--that
is to say the number which for the time being is the Nanking
equivalent of 75--are added all the same. At Lanchow in Chihli on
the Imperial Chinese Railway near Shanhai-kwan, 16 old cash count
as 100 cash, yet 33 are required to make up 200; in Tientsin from
which point the railway starts, 1000 cash are really 500 cash and
98 count there as 100. Now 2000 Chihli cash are represented by
325 coins, and 1000 by 162 coins, and 6000 by 975 coins, which
again count as 1000 large cash and equal on an average one
Mexican Dollar. Therefore to convert Lanchow cash into Tientsin
cash you must divide the Lanchow cash by 3, count 975 as 1000,
and consider this equal to a certain percentage of a theoretical
amount of silver known as a tael, which is always varying of
itself as well as by the fluctuations in the market value of
silver, and which is not alike in any two places, and may widely
vary in different portions of the same place.</p>

<p>Could anything be simpler? And yet there are those who say
that the system of money exchange in China is both cumbrous and
exasperating. Take as a further instance the cash in Yunnan.
Everyone knows that theoretically there are 2000 cash in the
tael, each tael containing 20 "strings," and each "string" 100
cash, but in Yunnan 2000 cash are not 2000 cash--they are only
1880 cash. This does not mean that 1880 cash are represented by
1880 coins, not at all; because 62 cash in Yunnan are counted as
100. Eighteen hundred and eighty cash are therefore represented
by only 1240 cash coins and all prices must be paid in this
proportion. Immediately outside the city, however, a string of
cash is a "full string" and contains 100 cash or rather it
contains as few cash as possibly can be passed for 100, a fair
average number being 98.</p>

<p>Silver is weighed in the City banks and at the wholesale
houses on the "capital scale," but in the retail stores on scales
that are heavier by 14 per cent, (one mace and 4 candareens in
the tael). Outside the city on the road to Tali there is a loss
on exchange varying according to your astuteness from 3 to 6 per
cent, on the capital scale.</p>

<p>There are two chief banks in Yunnan city. Wong's whose bank,
the signboard tells us, is "Beneficent, Rich, United," and Mong's
"Bank of the Hundred Streams," which is said to be still
richer.</p>

<p>With Mr. Jensen I called one evening upon Wong, and found him
with his sons and chief dependents at the evening meal. All rose
as we entered and pressed us to take a seat with them, and when
we would not, the father and grown-up son showed us into the
guest-room and seated us on the opium-dais under the canopy. The
opium-lamps were already lit; on a beautiful tray inlaid with
mother-of-pearl there were pipes for visitors, and phials of
prepared opium. Here we insisted on their leaving us and
returning to their supper; they finished speedily and returned to
their visitors. We were given good tea and afterwards a single
cigar was handed to each of us. In offering you a cigar it is not
the Chinese custom to offer you your choice from the cigar box;
the courtesy is too costly, for there are few Chinamen in these
circumstances who could refrain from helping themselves to a
handful. "When one is eating one's own" says the Chinese proverb,
"one does not eat to repletion; when one is eating another's, one
eats till the tears run."</p>

<p>Wong is one of the leading citizens of Yunnan, and is held in
high honour by his townsmen. His house is a handsome Chinese
mansion; it has a dignified entrance and the garden court is
richly filled with plants in porcelain vases. It may thus be said
of him, as of the Confucian Superior Man, "riches adorn his house
and virtue his person, his heart is expanded, and his body is at
ease."</p>

<p>A Szechuen man, a native of Chung-king, fifty-nine years of
age, Wong is a man of immense wealth, his bank being known all
over China, and having branches in capital cities so far distant
from each other as Peking, Canton, Kweiyang, Shanghai, Hankow,
Nanchang, Soochow, Hangchow, and Chungking. I may add that he has
smoked opium for many years.</p>

<p>I formed a high opinion of the intelligence of Wong. He
questioned me like an insurance doctor as to my family history,
and professed himself charmed with the amazing richness in sons
of my most honourable family. He had heard of my native country,
which he called Hsin Chin Shan, the "New Gold Mountain," to
distinguish it from the Lao Chin Shan, the "Old Gold Mountain,"
as the Chinese term California. I was the more pleased to find
that Wong had some knowledge of Australia and its gold, because a
few months before I had been pained by an incident bearing on
this very subject, which occurred to me in the highly civilised
city of Manila, in the Philippine Islands. On an afternoon in
August, 1893, I stood in the Augustine Church, in Old Manila, to
witness the funeral service of the Padre Provincial of the
Augustines. It was the first occasion for one hundred and
twenty-three years that the Provincial of the Order had died
while in the actual exercise of his office, and it was known that
the ceremony would be one of the most imposing ever seen in the
Islands. The fine old church, built by the son of the architect
of the Escorial--the only building in Manila left standing by the
earthquake of 1645--was crowded with mourners, and almost every
notability of the province was said to be present. During the
service two young Spaniards, students from the University close
by, pushed their way in beside me. Wishing to learn who were the
more distinguished of the mourners, I asked the students to
kindly point out to me the Governor-General (Blanco), and other
prominent officials, and they did so with agreeable courtesy.
When the service was finished I thanked them for the trouble they
had taken and was coming away, when one of them stopped me.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Caballero," he said, "but will you do me the
favour to tell me where you come from?"</p>

<p>"I am from Australia."</p>

<p>"From Austria! so then you come from Austria?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, from Australia."</p>

<p>"But 'Australia'--where is it?"</p>

<p>"It is a rich colony of England of immense importance."</p>

<p>"But where is it?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"Dios mio!" I exclaimed aghast, "it is in China."</p>

<p>But his friend interposed. "The gentleman is talking in fun,"
he said. "Thou knowest, Pepe, where is Australia, where is
Seednay, and Melboornay, where all the banks have broken one
after the other in a bankruptcy colossal."</p>

<p>"Ya me figuraba donde era," Pepe replied, as I edged
uncomfortably away.</p>

<p>During my journey across China it was not often that I was
called upon to make use of my profession. But I was pleased to be
of some service to this rich banker. He wished to consult me
professionally, because he had heard from the truthful lips of
rumour of the wonderful powers of divination given to the foreign
medical man. What was his probable tenure of life? That was the
problem. I gravely examined two of his pulses--every properly
organised Chinaman has four hundred--and finding his heart where
it should be in the centre of his body, with the other organs
ranged round it like the satellites round the sun--every Chinaman
is thus constructed--I was glad to be able to assure him that he
will certainly live forty years longer--if Heaven permit him.</p>

<p>Wong has a grown-up son of twenty who will succeed to the
bank; he is at present the managing proprietor of a small general
store purchased for him by his father. The son has been taught
photography by Mr. Jensen, and has an excellent camera obtained
from Paris. He is quite an enthusiast. In his shop a crowd is
always gathered round the counter looking at the work of this
Chinese amateur. There are a variety of stores for sale on the
shelves, and I was interested to notice the cheerful promiscuity
with which bottles of cyanide of potassium and perchloride of
mercury were scattered among bottles of carbonate of soda, of
alum, of Moet and Chandon (spurious), of pickles, and Howard's
quinine. The first time that cyanide of potassium is sold for
alum, or corrosive sublimate for bicarbonate of soda there will
be an eclat given to the dealings of this shop which will be very
gratifying to its owner.</p>

<p>The telegraph in Yunnan is very largely used by the Chinese,
especially by the bankers and officials. By telegraph you can
remit, as I have said, through the Chinese banks, telegraphic
transfers to the value of thousands of taels in single
transactions. It is principally the banks and the Government who
make use of the telegraph, and their communications are sent by
private code. When the Tsungli Yamen in Peking sends a telegram
to the Viceroy in Yunnan it is in code that the message comes;
and it is by private code also that a Chinese bank in Shanghai
telegraphs to its far inland agents. Messages are sent in China
by the Morse system. The method of telegraphing Chinese
characters, whose discovery enabled the Chinese to make use of
the telegraph, was the ingenious invention of a forgotten genius
in the Imperial Maritime Customs of China. The method is
simplicity itself. The telegraph code consists of ten thousand
numbers of four numerals each, and each group so constituted
represents a Chinese character. Any operator, however ignorant of
Chinese, can thus telegraph or receive a message in Chinese. He
receives, for instance, a message containing a series of numbers
such as 0018, 0297, 5396, 8424. He has before him a series of ten
thousand wood blocks on which the number is cut at one end and
the corresponding Chinese character at the other; he takes out
the number, touches the inkpad with the other end, and stamps
opposite each group its Chinese character. The system permits,
moreover, of the easy arrangement of indecipherable private
codes, because by adding or subtracting a certain number from
each group of figures, other characters than those telegraphed
can be indicated.</p>

<p>I need hardly add that the system of wood blocks is not in
practical use, for the numbers and their characters are now
printed in code-books. And here we have an instance of the
marvellous faculty of memorising characteristic of the Chinese. A
Chinaman's memory is something prodigious. From time immemorial
the memory of the Chinese has been developed above all the other
faculties. Memory is the secret of success in China, not
originality. Among a people taught to associate innovation with
impiety, and with whom precedent determines all action, it is
inevitable that the faculty of recollection should be the most
highly developed of all the mental faculties. Necessity compels
the Chinaman to have a good memory. No race has ever been known
where the power of memory has been developed even in rare
individual cases to the degree that is common to all classes of
the Chinese, especially to the literati.</p>

<p>The Chinese telegraph clerk quickly learns all the essential
portion of the code-book by heart. The book then lies in the
drawer a superfluity. It is claimed for Chiang, the second
Chinese clerk in Yunnan, that he knows all the 10,000 numbers and
their corresponding characters.</p>

<p>Telegrams from Yunnan to Shanghai cost twenty-two tael cents
(at the present value of the tael this is equal to sixpence) for
each Chinese character; but each word in any other language is
charged double, that is, forty-four cents.</p>

<p>From Yunnan to Talifu is a distance of 307 miles. The native
banker in the capital will remit for you by wire to his agent in
Tali the sum of 1000 taels, for a charge of eight taels,
exclusive of the cost of the telegram, and, as the value of
silver in Tali is one per cent, higher than it is in Yunnan, the
traveller can send his money by wire with perfect safety, and
lose nothing in the remittance, not even the cost of the
telegram.</p>

<p><b>SOLDIERS ON THE WALL OF YUNNAN CITY</b></p>
</center>

<p>The telegraph offices are separated from the city wall by a
small common, which is quite level, and which the Chinaman of the
future will convert into a bowling green and lawn-tennis ground.
There is a handsome entrance. The large portal is painted with
horrific gods armed with monstrous weapons. The Chinese still
seem to adhere to the belief that the deadliness of a weapon must
be in proportion to the savageness of its aspect. Inside, there
are spacious courts and well-furnished guest rooms, roomy
apartments, and offices for the mandarin, as well as comfortable
quarters for Mr. Jensen and his body of Chinese clerks and
operators. There is a pretty garden all bright and sunny, with a
pond of gold fish and ornamental parapet. Wandering freely in the
enclosure are peacocks and native companions, while a constant
playmate of the children is a little laughing monkey of a kind
that is found in the woods beyond Tali. At night a watchman
passes round the courts every two hours, striking a dismal gong
under the windows, and waking the foreigner from his slumbers;
but the noise he makes does not disturb the sleep of the
Chinese--indeed, it is open to question if there is any discord
known which, as mere noise, could disturb a Chinaman.</p>

<p>The walls that flank the entrance are covered with official
posters giving the names of the men of Yunnan City who
contributed to the relief of the sufferers by a recent famine in
Shansi, together with the amounts of their contributions and the
rewards to which their gifts entitled them. The Chinese are firm
believers in the doctrine of justification by works, and on these
posters one could read the exact return made in this world for an
act of merit, apart, of course, from the reward that will be
reaped in Heaven. In a case like this it is usually arranged that
for "gifts amounting to a certain percentage of the sums
ordinarily authorised, subscribers may obtain brevet titles,
posthumous titles, decorations, buttons up to the second class,
the grade of licentiate, and brevet rank up to the rank of
Colonel. Disgraced officials may apply to have their rank
restored. Nominal donations of clothes, if the money value of the
articles be presented instead, will entitle the givers to similar
honours."--The Peking Gazette, August 22, 1892.</p>

<p>In the centre of the green stands the hollow pillar in which
Chinese printed waste-paper is reverently burnt. "When letters
were invented," the Chinese say, "Heaven rejoiced and Hell
trembled." "Reverence the characters," is an injunction of
Confucius which no Chinaman neglects to follow. He remembers that
"he who uses lettered paper to kindle the fire has ten demerits,
and will have itchy sores;" he remembers that "he who tosses
lettered paper into dirty water, or burns it in a filthy place,
has twenty demerits and will frequently have sore eyes or become
blind," whereas "he who goes about and collects, washes, and
burns lettered paper, has 5000 merits, adds twelve years to his
life, will become honoured and wealthy, and his children and
grandchildren will be virtuous and filial." But his reverence has
strict limits, and while he reverences the piece of paper upon
which a moral precept is written, he often thinks himself
absolved from reverencing the moral precept itself, just as a
deacon in England need not necessarily be one who never
over-reached his neighbours or swindled his creditors.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV. THE FRENCH MISSION AND THE ARSENAL IN YUNNAN
CITY.</h3>

<p>The most prominent structure within the city walls is the
Heavenly Lord Hall (Tien-chu-tang), the pile of buildings which
form the headquarters of the French Mission in the province of
Yunnan. It was a master-stroke to secure possession of so
important a site. The palace is on a higher level even than the
yamen of the Viceroy, and must intercept much of the good fortune
that would otherwise flow into the city. The facade of the
central hall has been ornamented with a superb cross of porcelain
mosaic, which is a conspicuous object from the city wall. A large
garden, where the eucalyptus has been wisely planted, surrounds
the buildings. In residence in the Heavenly Hall are the
venerable Vicaire Apostolique of the province, Monseigneur
Fenouil, the Provicaire, and four missionary priests, all four of
whom are from Alsace. In the province altogether there are
twenty-two French priests and eight ordained Chinese
priests--thirty in all; their converts number 15,000. Monseigneur
Fenouil is a landmark of Western China; he first set foot in the
province in 1847, and is the oldest foreign resident in the
interior of China. No Chinaman speaks purer Chinese than he; he
thinks in Chinese. Present in the province throughout the
Mohammedan insurrection, he was an eye-witness of the horrors of
religious warfare. Few men have had their path in life marked by
more thrilling episodes. He was elected Bishop, in 1880, by the
unanimous vote of all the priests in the province, a vote
confirmed by Rome; which is, I am told, the mode of election by
which Catholic Missionary Bishops in China are always chosen.</p>

<p>The grand old Bishop seemed much amused at my journey. "I
suppose you are riding a mule," he said, "for you English have
large bones, and the Chinese ponies are very small." I said that
I had come so far most of the way on foot. "You speak Chinese, of
course?"</p>

<p>"Hardly at all; I speak only a dozen words of Chinese."</p>

<p>"Then you have a Chinese interpreter? No! An English companion
who can speak Chinese? No! A Chinese servant who can speak
English? No, and no escort! But without doubt you are armed? No!
No escort, no revolver, no companion, and you can live on Chinese
food. Ah! you have a brave heart, Monsieur."</p>

<p>At the time of my visit to Yunnan, Pere de Gorostarza, the
accomplished Provicaire, was absent at Mungtze deciding a
question of discipline. Four months before one of the most
trusted converts of the mission had been sent to Mungtze to
purchase a property for the use of the mission. He was given the
purchase-money of 400 taels, but, when he arrived in Mungtze, and
the eye of the mission was no longer upon him, he invested the
money, not in premises for the mission, but in a coolie-hong for
himself. His backsliding had availed him little. And he was now
defending his conduct as best he could before the Bishop's
deputy.</p>

<p>Converts of the French Mission in China, it is well to
remember, are no longer French subjects or proteges; the
objection is no longer tenable that the mission shields bad
characters who only become converted in order to escape from the
consequences of their guilt.</p>

<p>How wonderful has been the pioneer work done by the Jesuit
Missionaries in China! It may almost be said that the foundation
of all that we know about China we owe to the Jesuit
Missionaries. All maps on China are founded upon the maps of the
Jesuit Missionaries employed for the purpose by the Emperor
Kanghi (1663-1723), "the greatest prince who ever graced the
throne of China." Their accuracy has been the wonder of all
geographers for a century past. "Now that the 'Great River' (the
Yangtse) has been surveyed," says Captain Blakiston, "for nearly
1600 miles from the ocean, and with instruments and appliances
such as were unknown in the days of those energetic and
persevering men, no small praise is due to the first Christian
explorers for the extraordinary correctness of their maps and
records." The reports of the early Jesuit Missionaries even
Voltaire describes as the "productions of the most intelligent
travellers that have extended and embellished the fields of
science and philosophy."</p>

<p>Yet we, as Protestants, are warned by a great missionary that
we must not be deluded by these insidious compliments; we must
not forget that the work of the Jesuits in China "overtops all
other forms of superstition and error in danger, and stands forth
an organised conspiracy against the liberties of mankind. The
schemes of the Jesuits must be checked."</p>

<p>One Sunday morning Mr. Jensen and I rode round the city wall.
This is one of the most massive walls in a country of walled
cities. It is built of brick and stone over a body of earth
thirty feet thick; it is of imposing height, and wide enough for
a carriage drive. When I was mounted on my mule the upper edge of
the parapet was on a level with my forehead. There are six city
gates. The great north gate is closely barred all through the
rains to prevent the entrance of the "Flood God," who,
fortunately, his intelligence being limited, knows no other way
to enter the city than by this gate. The great turreted south
gate is the most important of all, as it is in all Chinese
cities. Near this gate the Viceroy's Yamen is situated, and the
Yamen of the Futai (Governor of the Province); both buildings, of
course, looking to the south, as did the Temple of Solomon and
the tombs of the Mings, and as Chinese custom requires that every
building of importance shall do, whether temple or yamen, private
residence or royal palace. But why should they look south?
Because from the south the sun comes, bringing with it "genial
and animating influence," and putting new life into plant and
animal after the winter.</p>

<p><b>THE PAGODA OF YUNNAN CITY, 250 FEET HIGH</b></p>
</center>

<p>The south gate is a double gate in a semi-circular bastion.
Beyond it is a splendid triumphal arch erected by a grateful
community to the memory of the late viceroy. A thickly-populated
suburb extends from here to the wide common, where stands the
lofty guardian pagoda of the city, 250 feet high, a conspicuous
sight from every part of the great Yunnan plain. Rich temples are
all around it, their eaves hung with sweet-toned bells, which
tinkle with every breath of wind, giving forth what the Chinese
poetically describe as "the tribute of praise from inanimate
nature to the greatness of Buddha."</p>

<p>In the early morning the traveller is awakened by the steam
whistle of the arsenal, a strange sound to be heard in so far
inland a city in China. The factory is under Chinese management,
a fact patent to any visitor. Its two foremen were trained partly
in the arsenal in Nanking under Dr. Macartney (now Sir Halliday
Macartney), and partly in the splendid Shanghai arsenal under Mr.
Cornish. I went to the arsenal, and was received as usual in the
opium-room. There was nothing to conceal, and I was freely shown
everything. The arsenal turns out Krupp guns of 7.5 centimetres
calibre, but the iron is inferior, and the workmen are in need of
better training. Cartridges are also made here. And in one room I
saw two men finishing with much neatness a pure silver opium-tray
intended for the Fantai (provincial treasurer), but why made in
the arsenal only a Chinaman could tell you. Work in the furnace
is done at a disadvantage owing to the shortness of the furnace
chimney, which is only 25 feet high. All attempts to increase its
height are now forbidden by the authorities. There was agitation
in the city when the chimney was being heightened. Geomancers
were consulted, who saw the feeling of the majority, and
therefore gave it as their unprejudiced opinion that, if the
chimney were not stunted, the <i>fungshui</i> (good luck) of the
Futai's yamen (provincial governor), and of that portion of the
city under its protection, would depart for ever. All the
machinery of the arsenal is stamped with the name of Greenwood,
Battley and Co., Leeds. Rust and dirt are everywhere, and the 100
workmen for whom pay is drawn never number on the rare pay days
more than sixty persons, a phenomenon observed in most
establishments in China worked by government. Yet with a
foreigner in charge excellent work could be turned out from the
factory. The buildings are spacious, the grounds are ample.</p>

<p>The powderfactory isoutsidethecity, near thenortheastern angle
ofthe wall, but the powder magazine is on some rising ground
inside the city. No guns are stationed anywhere on the walls,
though they may be in concealment in the turrets; but near the
small west gate I saw some small cannon of ancient casting, built
on the model of the guns cast by the Jesuit missionaries in China
two centuries ago, if they were not the actual originals. They
were all marked in relief with a cross and the device I.H.S.--a
motto that you would think none but a Chinaman could select for a
weapon designed to destroy men, yet characteristic of this
country of contradictions. "The Chinese statesman," says Wingrove
Cooke, the famous Times correspondent, "cuts off 10,000 heads,
and cites a passage from Mencius about the sanctity of human
life. He pockets the money given him to repair an embankment and
thus inundates a province, and he deplores the land lost to the
cultivator of the soil."</p>

<p>Du Halde tells us that "the first Chinese cannon were cast
under the directions of Pere Verbiest in 1682, who blest the
cannon, and gave to each the name of a saint." "A female saint!"
says Hue.</p>

<p>Near the arsenal and drill ground there is a large intramural
swamp or reedy lake, the reeds of which have an economic value as
wicks for Chinese candles. Dykes cross the swamp in various
directions, and in the centre there is a well known Taoist
Temple, a richly endowed edifice, with superior gods and censers
of great beauty. Where the swamp deepens into a pond at the
margin of the temple, a pretty pavilion has been built, which is
a favourite resort of the Yunnan gentry. The most chic dinner
parties in the province are given here. The pond itself swarms
with sacred fish; they are so numerous that when the masses move
the whole pond vibrates. Many merits are gained by feeding the
fish, and, as it happened at the time of my visit that I had no
money, I was constrained to borrow fifteen cash from my chair
coolies, with which I purchased some of the artificial food that
women were vending and threw it to the fish, so that I might add
another thousand to the innumerable merits I have already hoarded
in Heaven.</p>

<p>Upon a pretty wooded hill near the centre of the city is the
Confucian Temple, and on the lower slope of the hill, in an
admirable position, are the quarters of the China Inland Mission,
conducted by Mr. and Mrs. X., assisted by Mr. Graham, who at the
time of my visit was absent in Tali, and by two exceedingly nice
young girls, one of whom comes from Melbourne. The single ladies
live in quarters of their own on the edge of a swamp, and surfer
inevitably from malarial fever. Mr. X. "finds the people very
hard to reach," he told me, and his success has only been
relatively cheering. After labouring here nearly six years--the
mission was first opened in 1882--he has no male converts, though
there are two promising nibblers, who are waiting for the first
vacancy to become adherents. There was a convert, baptised before
Mr. X. came here, a poor manure-coolie, who was employed by the
mission as an evangelist in a small way; but "Satan tempted him,
he fell from grace, and had to be expelled for stealing the
children's buttons." It was a sad trial to the mission. The men
refuse to be saved, recalcitrant sinners! but the women happily
are more tractable. Mr. X. has up to date (May, 1894), baptised
his children's nurse girl, the "native helper" of the single
ladies, and his wife's cook. Mr. X. works hard, far too hard. He
is of the type that never can be successful in China. He was
converted when nearing middle age, is narrow and uncompromising
in his views, and is as stern as a Cameronian. It is a farce
sending such men to China. At his services there is never any
lack of listeners, who marvel greatly at the new method of
speaking Chinese which this enterprising emissary--in London he
was in the oil trade--is endeavouring to introduce into the
province. Of "tones" instead of the five used by the Chinese, he
does not recognise more than two, and these he uses
indifferently. He hopes, however, to be understood by loud
speaking, and he bellows at the placid coolies like a bull of
Bashan.</p>

<p>I paid an early visit to my countrymen at the Yesu-tang (Jesus
Hall), the mission home, as I thought that my medical knowledge
might be of some service. I wished to learn a little about their
work, but to my great sorrow I was no sooner seated than they
began plying me with questions about the welfare of my soul. I am
a "poor lost sinner," they told me. They flung texts at my head,
and then sang a terrifying ballad by which I learnt for the first
time the awful fate that is to be mine. It is something too
dreadful to contemplate. And the cheerful equanimity with which
they announced it to me! I left the Yesu-tang in a cold sweat,
and never returned there.</p>

<p>Missionary work is being pursued in the province with
increasing vigour. Among its population of from five to seven
millions, spread over an area of 107,969 square miles, there are
eighteen Protestant missionaries, nine men and nine ladies (this
is the number at present, but the usual strength is
twenty-three). Stations are open at Chaotong (1887), Tong-chuan
(1891), Yunnan City (1882), Tali (1881), and Kuhtsing (1889). The
converts number--the work, however, must not be judged by
statistics--two at Chaotong, one at Tongchuan, three at Yunnan
City, three at Tali, and two at Kuhtsing.</p>

<p>That the Chinese are capable of very rapid conversion can be
proved by numberless instances quoted in missionary reports on
China. The Rev. S. F. Woodin (in the Records of the Missionary
Conference, 1877, p. 91) states that he converted a "grossly
immoral Chinaman, who had smoked opium for more than twenty
years," simply by saying to him "in a spirit of earnest love,
elder brother Six, as far as I can see, you must perish; you are
Hell's child."</p>

<p>Mr. Stanley P. Smith, B.A., who was formerly stroke of the
Cambridge eight, had been only seven months in China when he
performed that wonderful conversion, so applauded at the
Missionary Conference of 1888, of "a young Chinaman, a learned
man, a B.A. of his University," who heard Mr. Smith speak in the
Chinese that can be acquired in seven months, and "accepted Him
there and then." (Records of the Missionary Conference, 1888, i.
46). Indeed, the earlier the new missionaries in China begin to
preach the more rapid are the conversions they make.</p>

<p>Now, in this province of Yunnan, conversions will have to be
infinitely more rapid before we can say that there is any
reasonable hope of the proximate conversion of the province. The
problem is this: In a population of from five to seven millions
of friendly and peaceable people, eighteen missionaries in eight
years (the average time during which the mission stations have
been opened), have converted eleven Chinese; how long, then, will
it take to convert the remainder?</p>

<p>"I believe," said a late member of the House of Commons, who
was once Lord Mayor of London, speaking at the anniversary
meeting of the China Inland Mission in 1884, "I believe God
intends to accomplish great things in China," and, undoubtedly,
the opinion of an ex-Lord Mayor on such a subject is entitled to
great weight.</p>

<p>"The Gospel," he said, "is making rapid progress in China. . .
. We are amazed at the great things God hath wrought" (in the
conversion of the Chinese).</p>

<p>Let us examine for a moment an instance of the rapid progress
which excited the amazement of this good man. No missionary body
in China is working with greater energy than the China Inland
Mission. Their missionaries go far afield in their work, and they
are, what their mission intends them to be, pioneer Protestant
missionaries in Inland China. At the present time, the beginning
of 1894, the Inland Mission numbers 611 male and female
missionaries. They are assisted by 261 paid native helpers, and
the combined body of 872 Evangelists baptised during the year
just passed (1893) 821 Chinese. These figures, taken from China's
Millions, 1894, p. 122, attest a rather lower rate of progress
than the other missions can boast of; but a considerable part of
the inland work, it must be remembered, is the most difficult
work of all--the preaching of the Gospel for the first time in
newly-opened districts.</p>

<p>The Viceroy of the two provinces of Yunnan and Kweichow,
Wong-wen-shao, is one of the most enlightened rulers in China. No
stranger could fail to be impressed with his keen intellectual
face and courtly grace of manner. His career has been a
distinguished one. Good fortune attended him even at his birth.
He is a native of Hangchow, in Chehkiang, a city famous in China
for its coffins. Every Chinaman will tell you that true felicity
consists in three things: to be born in Peking (under the shadow
of the Son of Heaven); to live in Soochow (where the girls are
prettiest); and to die in Hangchow (where the coffins are
grandest). Twelve years ago he was Governor of the province of
Hunan. Called then to Peking as one of the Ministers of State of
the "Tsungli Yamen," or Foreign Office, he remained there four
years, his retirement being then due to the inexorable law which
requires an official to resign office and go into mourning for
three years on the death of one of his parents. In this case it
was his mother. (A Chinese mother suckles her child two and a
half years, and, as the age of the child is dated from a time
anterior by some months to birth, the child is three years old
before it leaves its mother's breast. Three years, therefore, has
been defined as the proper period for mourning). At the
termination of the three years, Wong was reappointed Governor of
Hunan, and a year and a half later, in May, 1890, he was
appointed to his present important satrapy, where he has the
supreme control of a district larger than Spain and Portugal, and
with a population larger than that of Canada and Australia
combined. In May, 1893, he made application to the throne to be
allowed to return to his ancestral home to die; but the privilege
was refused him.</p>

<p><b>THE VICEROY OF Two PROVINCES</b></p>
</center>

<p>Before leaving Yunnan city the Mandarin Li kindly provided me
with a letter of introduction to his friend Brigadier-General
Chang-chen Nien, in Tengyueh. Since it contained a communication
between persons of rank, the envelope was about the size of an
ordinary pillow-slip. The General was presumably of higher rank
than the traveller; I had, therefore, in accordance with Chinese
etiquette, to provide myself with a suitable visiting card of a
size appropriate to his importance. Now Chinese visiting cards
differ from ours in differing in size according to the importance
of the person to whom they are to be presented. My ordinary card
is eight inches by three, red in colour--the colour of
happiness--and inscribed in black with the three characters of my
Chinese name.</p>

<p>But the card that I was expected to present to the General was
very much larger than this. Folded it was of the same size, but
unfolded it was ten times the size of the other (eight by thirty
inches), and the last page, politely inscribed in Chinese,
contained this humiliating indication of its purport: "Your
addlepated nephew Mo-li-son bows his stupid head, and pays his
humble respects to your exalted Excellency."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI. THE JOURNEY FROM YUNNAN CITY TO TALIFU.</h3>

<p>I sold the mule in Yunnan City, and bought instead a little
white pony at a cost, including saddle, bridle, and bells, of 3
pounds 6s. In doing this I reversed the exchange that would have
been made by a Chinaman. A mule is a more aristocratic animal
than a pony; it thrives better on a journey, and is more
sure-footed. If a pony, the Chinese tell you, lets slip one foot,
the other three follow; whereas a mule, if three feet slip from
under him, will hold on with the fourth.</p>

<p>My men, who had come with me from Chaotong, were paid off in
Yunnan; but it was pleasant to find all three accept an offer to
go on with me to Talifu. Coolies to do this journey are usually
supplied by the coolie agents for the wage of two chien a day
each (7<i>d</i>.), each man to carry seventy catties (93 lbs.),
find himself by the way, and spend thirteen days on the journey.
But no coolies, owing to the increase in the price of food, were
now willing to go for so little. Accordingly I offered my two
coolies three taels each (9<i>s</i>.), instead of the hong price
of 7<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>., and loads of fifty catties instead of
seventy catties. I offered to refund them 100 cash each
(2.5<i>d</i>.) a day for every day that they had been delayed in
Yunnan and, in addition, I promised them a reward of five mace
each (1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.) if they would take me to Tali in
nine days, instead of thirteen, the first evening not to count.
To Laohwan, who had no load to carry, but had to attend to me and
the pony and pay away the cash, I made a similar offer. These
terms, involving me in an outlay of 365. for hiring three men to
go with me on foot 915 li, and return empty-handed, were
considered liberal, and were agreed to at once.</p>

<p>The afternoon, then, of the 19th April saw us again en route,
bound to the west to Talifu, the most famous city in western
China, the headquarters of the Mohammedan "Sultan" during the
great rebellion of 1857-1873.</p>

<p>By the courtesy of the Mandarin Li, two men were detailed to
"sung" me--to accompany me, that is--and take the responsibility
for my safe delivery at the next hsien. One was a "wen," a
chairen, or yamen runner; the other was a "wu," a soldier, with a
sightless right eye, who was dressed in the ragged vestiges of a
uniform that reflected both the poverty of his environment and,
inversely, the richness of his commanding officer. For in China
the officer enriches himself by the twofold expedient of drawing
pay for soldiers who have no existence, except in his statement
of claim, and by diverting the pay of his soldiers who do exist
from their pockets into his own.</p>

<p><b>THE GIANT OF YUNNAN</b></p>
</center>

<p>As I was leaving, a colossal Chinaman, sent by the Fantai to
speed the foreign gentleman on his way, strode into the court. He
was dressed in military jacket and official hat and foxtails. He
was the Yunnan giant, Chang Yan Miun, a kindly-featured monster,
whom it is a pity to see buried in China when he might be holding
levees of thousands in a Western side-show. For the information
of those in search of novelties, I may say that the giant is
thirty years of age, a native of Tong-chuan, born of parents of
ordinary stature; he is 7ft. 1in. in his bare feet, and weighs,
when in condition, 27st. 6 lb. With that ingenious arrangement
for increasing height known to all showmen, this giant might be
worth investing in as a possible successor to his unrivalled
namesake. There is surely money in it. Chang's present earnings
are rather less than 7<i>s</i>. a month, without board and
lodging; he is unmarried, and has no incumbrance; and he is
slightly taller and much more massively built than a well-known
American giant whom I once had permission to measure, who has
been shown half over the world as the "tallest man on earth," his
height being attested as 7ft. 11in. in his stockings' soles, and
who commands the salary of an English admiral.</p>

<p>We made only a short march the first evening, but after that
we travelled by long stages. The country was very pretty, open
glades with clumps of pine, and here and there a magnificent
sacred tree like the banyan, under whose far-reaching branches
small villages are often half concealed. Despite the fertility of
the country, poverty and starvation met us at every step; the
poor were lingering miserably through the year. Goitre, too, was
increasing in frequency. It was rarely that a group gathered to
see us some of whose members were not suffering from this
horrible deformity. And everywhere in the pretty country were
signs of the ruthless devastation of religious war. That was a
war of extermination. "A storm of universal fire blasted every
field, consumed every house, destroyed every temple."</p>

<p>Crumbling walls are at long distances from the towns they used
to guard; there are pastures and waste lands where there were
streets of buildings; walls of houses have returned whence they
came to the mother earth; others are roofless.</p>

<p>In the open country, far from habitation, the traveller comes
across groups of bare walls with foundations still uncovered, and
dismantled arches, and broken images in the long grass, that were
formerly yamens and temples in the midst of thriving communities.
Yet there are signs of a renaissance; many new houses are being
built along the main road; walls are being repaired, and bridges
reconstructed. When an exodus takes place from Szechuen to this
province, there is little reason why Yunnan should not become one
of the richest provinces in China. It has every advantage of
climate, great fertility of soil, and immense mineral resources
hardly yet developed. It needs population. It needs the
population that dwelt in the province before the rebellion
involved the death of millions. It can absorb an immense
proportion of the surplus population of China. During, and
subsequent to, the Tai-ping rebellion the province of Szechuen
increased by 45,000,000 in forty years (1842-82); given the
necessity, there seems no reason why the population of Yunnan
should not increase in an almost equal proportion.</p>

<p>On the 22nd we passed Lu-feng-hsien, another ruined town. The
finest stone bridge I have seen in Western China, arid one that
would arrest attention in any country in the world, is at this
town. It crosses the wide bed of a stream that in winter is
insignificant, but which grows in volume in the rains of summer
to a broad and powerful river. It is a bridge of seven beautiful
arches; it is 12 yards broad and 150 yards long, of perfect
simplicity and symmetry, with massive piers, all built of dressed
masonry and destined to survive the lapse of centuries. Triumphal
archways with memorial tablets and pedestals of carved lions are
befitting portals to a really noble work.</p>

<p>On the 23rd we reached the important city of Chuhsing-fu, a
walled city, still half-in-ruins, that was long occupied by the
Mohammedans, and suffered terrible reprisals on its recapture by
the Imperialists. For four days we had travelled at an average
rate of one hundred and five li (thirty-five miles) a day. I
must, however, note that these distances as estimated by Mr.
Jensen, the constructor of the telegraph line, do not agree with
the distances in Mr. Baber's itinerary. The Chinese distances in
li agree in both estimates; but, whereas Mr. Jensen allows three
li for a mile, Mr. Baber allows four and a-half, a wide
difference indeed. For convenience sake I have made use of the
telegraph figures, but Mr. Baber was so scrupulously accurate in
all that he wrote that I have no doubt the telegraph distances
are over-estimated.</p>

<p>We were again in a district almost exclusively devoted to the
poppy; the valley-plains sparkled with poppy flowers of a
multiplicity of tints. The days were pleasant, and the sun shone
brightly; every plant was in flower; doves cooed in the trees,
and the bushes in blossom were bright with butterflies. Lanes led
between hedges of wild roses white with flower, and, wherever a
creek trickled across the plain, its willow-lined borders were
blue with forget-me-nots. And everywhere a peaceful people, who
never spoke a word to the foreigner that was not friendly.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 24th, at a ruined town thirty li from
Luho, we received our first check. It was at a walled town, with
gateways and a pagoda that gave some indication of its former
prosperity, prettily situated among the trees on the confines of
a plain of remarkable fertility. Near sundown we passed down the
one long street, all battered and dismantled, which is all that
is left of the old town. News of the foreigner quickly spread,
and the people gathered into the street to see me--no reception
could be more flattering. We did not wait, but, pushing on, we
passed out by the west gate and hastened on across the plain. But
I noticed that Laohwan kept looking back at the impoverished
town, shaking his head and stuttering "<i>pu-pu-pu-pu-hao!
pu-pu-pu-hao!</i>" (bad! bad !) We had thus gone half a mile or
so, when we were arrested by cries behind us, and our last
chairen was seen running, panting, after us. We waited for him;
he was absurdly excited, and could hardly speak. He made an
address to me, speaking with great energy and gesticulation; but
what was its purport, <i>Dios sabe</i>. When he had finished, not
to be outdone in politeness, I thanked him in English for the
kindly phrases in which he had spoken to me, assured him of my
continued sympathy, and undertook to say that, if ever he came to
Geelong, he would find there a house at his disposition, and a
friend who would be ever ready to do him a service. He seemed
completely mystified, and began to speak again, more excitedly
than before. It was getting late, and a crowd was collecting, so
I checked him by waving my left hand before my face and bawling
at him with all my voice: "<i>Putung</i>, you stupid ass,
<i>putung</i> (I don't understand)! Can't you see I don't
understand a word you say, you benighted heathen you?
<i>Putung</i>, man, <i>putung</i>! Advance Australia, <i>dzo</i>
(go)!" And, swinging open my umbrella, I walked on. His
excitement increased--we must go back to the town; he seized me
by the wrists, and urged me to go back. We had a slight
discussion; his feet gave from under him and he fell down, and I
was going on cheerfully when he burst out crying. This I
interpreted to mean that he would get into trouble if I did not
return, so, of course, I turned back at once, for the tears of a
Chinaman are sadly affecting. Back, then, we were taken to an
excellent inn in the main street, where a respectful <i>levee</i>
of the townsfolk had assembled to welcome me. A polite official
called upon me, to whom I showed, with simulated indignation, my
official card and my Chinese passport, and I hinted to him in
English that this interference with my rights as a traveller from
England, protected by the favour of the Emperor, would--let him
mark my word--be made an international question. While saying
this, I inadvertently left on my box, so that all might see it,
the letter of introduction to the Brigadier-General in Tengyueh,
which was calculated to give the natives an indication of the
class of Chinese who had the privilege to be admitted to my
friendship. The official was very polite and apologetic. I freely
forgave him, and we had tea together.</p>

<p>He had done it all for the best. A moneyed foreigner was
passing through his town near sundown without stopping to spend a
single cash there. Was it not his duty, as a public-spirited man,
to interfere and avert this loss, and compel the stranger to
spend at least one night within his gates?</p>

<p>This was what I wrote at the time. I subsequently found that I
had been sent for to come back because the road was believed to
be dangerous, there was no secure resting-place, and the
authorities could not guarantee my safety. Imagine a Chinese in a
Western country acting with the bluster that I did, although in
good humour; I wonder whether he would be treated with the
courtesy that those Chinamen showed to me!</p>

<p>On the 25th an elderly chairen was ready to accompany us in
the morning, and he remained with us all day. All day he was
engrossed in deep thought. He spoke to no one, but he kept a
watchful eye over his charge, never leaving me a moment, but
dogging my very footsteps all the hundred li we travelled
together. Poorly clad, he was better provided than his brother of
yesterday in that he wore sandals, whereas the chairen of
yesterday was in rags and barefoot He was, of course, unprovided
with weapon of any kind--it was moral force that he relied on.
Over his shoulder was slung a bag from which projected his
opium-pipe; a tobacco pipe and tobacco box hung at his girdle; a
green glass bottle of crude opium he carried round his neck.</p>

<p>The chairen is the policeman of China, the lictor of the
magistrate, the satellite of the official; the soldier is the
representative of military authority. Now, China, in the person
of her greatest statesman, Li Hung Chang, has, through the
secretary of the Anti-Opium Society, called upon England "to aid
her in the efforts she is now making to suppress opium." If,
then, China is sincere in her alleged efforts to abolish opium,
it is the chairen and the soldier who must be employed by the
authorities to suppress the evil; yet I have never been
accompanied by either a chairen or a soldier who did not smoke
opium, nor have I to my knowledge ever met a chairen or a soldier
who was not an opium-smoker. Through all districts of Yunnan,
wherever the soil permits it, the poppy is grown for miles, as
far as the sight can reach, on every available acre, on both
sides of the road.</p>

<p>But why does China grow this poppy? Have not the literati and
elders of Canton written to support the schemes of the Anti-Opium
Society in these thrilling words: "If Englishmen wish to know the
sentiments of China, here they are:--If we are told to let things
go on as they are going, then there is no remedy and no salvation
for China. Oh! it makes the blood run cold, and we want in this
our extremity to ask the question of High Heaven, what unknown
crimes or atrocity have the Chinese people committed beyond all
others that they are doomed to suffer thus?" (Cited by Mr. S. S.
Mander, China's Millions, iv., 156.)</p>

<p>And the women of Canton, have they not written to the
missionaries "that there is no tear that they shed that is not
red with blood because of this opium?" ("China," by M. Reed, p.
63). Why, then, does China, while she protests against the
importation of a drug which a Governor of Canton, himself an
opium-smoker, described as a "vile excrementitious substance"
("Barrow's Travels," p. 153), sanction, if not foster, with all
the weight of the authorities in the ever-extending
opium-districts the growth of the poppy? To the Rev. G. Piercy
(formerly of the W.M.S., Canton), we are indebted for the
following explanation of this anomaly: China, it appears, is
growing opium in order to put a stop to opium-smoking.</p>

<p>"Moreover, China has not done with the evils of opium, even if
our hands were washed of this traffic to-day. China in her
desperation has invoked Satan to cast out Satan. She now grows
her own opium, vainly dreaming that, if the Indian supply lapse,
she can then deal with this rapidly growing evil. But Satan is
not divided against himself; he means his kingdom to stand.
Opium-growing will not destroy opium-smoking." (Missionary
Conference of 1888, Records, ii., 546.)</p>

<p>"Yet the awful guilt remains," said the Ven. Archdeacon Farrar
on a. recent occasion in Westminster Abbey, "that we, 'wherever
winds blow and waters roll,' have girdled the world with a zone
of drunkenness, until I seem to shudder as I think of the curses,
not loud but deep, muttered against our name by races which our
fire-water has decimated and our vice degraded." (National
Righteousness, December 1892, p. 4.)</p>

<p>And this patriotic utterance of a distinguished Englishman the
Chinese will quote in unexpected support of the memorial "On the
Restriction of Christianity" addressed to the Throne of China in
1884 by the High Commissioner Peng Yu-lin, which memorial stated
in severe language that "since the treaties have permitted
foreigners from the West to spread their doctrines, the morals of
the people have been greatly injured." (" The Causes of the
Anti-Foreign Disturbances in China." Rev. Gilbert Reid, M.A., p.
9.)</p>

<p><b>THE "EAGLE NEST BARRIER," ON THE ROAD TO TALIFU</b></p>
</center>

<p>Forty li from our sleeping place we came to the pretty town of
Shachiaokai, on some undulating high ground well sheltered with
trees. Justice had lately been here with her headsman and brought
death to a gang of malefactors. Their heads, swinging in wooden
cages, hung from the tower near the gateway. They could be seen
by all persons passing along the road, and, with due
consideration for the feelings of the bereaved relatives, they
were hung near enough for the features to be recognised by their
friends. Each head was in a cage of its own, and was suspended by
the pigtail to the rim, so that it might not lie upside down but
could by-and-by rattle in its box as dead men's bones should do.
To each cage a white ticket was attached giving the name of the
criminal and his confession of the offence for which he was
executed. They were the heads of highway robbers who had murdered
two travellers on the road near Chennan-chow, and it was this
circumstance which accounted for the solicitude of the officials
near Luho to prevent our being benighted in a district where such
things were possible.</p>

<p>Midway between Shachiaokai and Pupeng there was steep climbing
to be done till we reached Ying-wu-kwan, the "Eagle Nest
Barrier," which is more than 8000 feet above the sea. Then by
very hilly and poor country we came to Pupeng, and, pursuing our
way over a thickly-peopled plateau, we reached a break in the
high land from which we descended into a wide and deep valley,
skirted with villages and gleaming with sheets of water--the
submerged rice-fields. At the foot of the steep was a poor mud
town, but, standing back from it in the fields, was a splendid
Taoist temple fit for a capital. In this village we were delayed
for nearly an hour while my three men bargained against half the
village for the possession of a hen that was all unconscious of
the comments, flattering and depreciatory, that were being passed
on its fatness. It was secured eventually for 260 cash, the
vendors having declared that the hen was a family pet, hatched on
a lucky day, that it had been carefully and tenderly reared, and
that nothing in the world could induce them to part with it for a
cash less than 350. My men with equal confidence, based upon long
experience in the purchase of poultry, asserted that the real
value of the hen was 200 cash, and that not a single cash more of
the foreign gentleman's money could they conscientiously invest
in such a travesty of a hen as that. But little by little each
party gave way till they were able to <i>tomber d'accord</i>.</p>

<p>A pleasant walk across the busy plain brought us to Yunnan
Yeh, where we passed the night.</p>

<p>On the 27th we had an unsatisfactory day's journey. We
travelled only seventy li over an even road, yet with four good
hours of daylight before us my men elected to stop when we came
to the village of Yenwanshan. We had left the main road for some
unknown reason, and were taking a short cut over the mountains to
Tali. But a short-cut in China often means the longest distance,
and I was sure that this short-cut would bring us to Tali a day
later than if we had gone by the main road--in ten days, that is,
from Yunnan, instead of the nine which my men had promised me.
Laohwan, who, like most Chinamen I met, persisted in thinking
that I was deaf, yelled to me in the presence of the village that
the next stopping place was twenty miles distant, that "mitte
liao! mitte liao!" ("there were no beans") on the way for the
pony, and that assuredly we would reach Tali to-morrow, having
given the pony the admirable rest that here offered. As he
stammered these sentences the people supported what he said.
Obviously their statements were ex parte, and were promoted
solely by the desire to see the distinguished foreign mandarin
sojourn for one night in their hungry midst. So here I was
detained in a tumble-down inn that had formerly been a temple.
All of us, men and master, were housed in the old guest-room.
Beds were formed of disused coffin boards, laid between steps
made of clods of dry clay; the floor was earth, the windows
paper. The pony was feeding from a trough in the temple hall
itself, an armful of excellent grass before it, while a bucket of
beans was soaking for him in our corner. Other mules and ponies
were stationed in the side pavilions where formerly were
displayed the scenes of torture in the Buddhist Hells.</p>

<p>As I wrote at a table by the window, a crowd collected,
stretching across the street and quarrelling to catch a glimpse
of the foreign teacher and his strange method of writing, so
different from the Chinese. Poor sickly people were these--of the
ten in the first row three were suffering from goitre, one from
strabismus, and two from ophthalmia. All were poorly clad and
poorly nourished; all were very dirty, and their heads were
unshaven of the growth of days. But, despite their poverty,
nearly all the women, the children as well as the grandmothers,
wore silver earrings of pretty filigree.</p>

<p>Now, even among these poor people, I noticed that there was a
disposition rather to laugh at me than to open the eyes of
wonder; and this is a peculiarity of the Chinese which every
traveller will be struck with. It often grieved me. During my
journey, although I was treated with undeniable friendliness, I
found that the Chinese, instead of being impressed by my
appearance, would furtively giggle when they saw me. But they
were never openly rude like the coloured folk were in Jamaica,
when, stranded in their beautiful island, I did them the honour
to go as a "walk-foot buccra" round the sugar plantations from
Ewarton to Montego Bay. Even poor ragged fellows, living in utter
misery, would laugh and snigger at me when not observed, and
crack jokes at the foreigner who was well-fed, well-clad, and
well-mounted in a way you would think to excite envy rather than
derision. But Chinese laughter seems to be moved by different
springs from ours. The Chinaman makes merry in the presence of
death. A Chinaman, come to announce to you the death of a beloved
parent or brother, laughs heartily as he tells you--you might
think he was overflowing with joy, but he is really sick and sore
at heart, and is only laughing to deceive the spirits. So it may
be that the poor beggars who laughed at that noble presence which
has been the admiration of my friends in four continents, were
moved to do so by the hope to deceive the evil spirits who had
punished them with poverty, and so by their apparent gaiety
induce them to relax the severity of their punishment.</p>

<p>To within two or three miles of this village the road was
singularly level; I do not think that it either rose or fell 100
feet in twenty miles. Forty li from where we slept the night
before, having previously left the main road, we came to the
large walled town of Yunnan-hsien. The streets were crowded, for
it was market day, and both sides of the main thoroughfares,
especially in the vicinity of the Confucian Temple, were thronged
with peasant women selling garden produce, turnips, beans and
peas, and live fish caught in the lake beyond Tali. Articles of
Western trade were also for sale--stacks of calico, braid, and
thread, "new impermeable matches made in Trieste," and "toilet
soap of the finest quality." I had a royal reception as I rode
through the crowd, and the street where was situated the inn to
which we went for lunch speedily became impassable. There was
keen competition to see me. Two thieves were among the foremost,
with huge iron crowbars chained to their necks and ankles, while
a third prisoner, with his head pilloried in a cangue, obstructed
the gaze of many. There was the most admirable courtesy shown me;
it was the "foreign teacher" they wished to see, not the "foreign
devil." When I rose from the table, half a dozen guests sitting
at the other tables rose also and bowed to me as I passed out. Of
all people I have ever met, the Chinese are, I think, the
politest. My illiterate Laohwan, who could neither read nor
write, had a courtesy of demeanour, a well-bred ease of manner, a
graceful deference that never approached servility, which it was
a constant pleasure to me to witness.</p>

<p>As regards the educated classes, there can be little doubt, I
think, that there are no people in the world so scrupulously
polite as the Chinese. Their smallest actions on all occasions of
ceremony are governed by the most minute rules. Let me give as an
example, the method of cross-examination to which the stranger is
subjected, and which is a familiar instance of true politeness in
China.</p>

<p>When a well-bred Chinaman, of whatever station, meets you for
the first time, he thus addresses you, first asking you how old
you are:</p>

<p>"What is your honourable age?"</p>

<p>"I have been dragged up a fool so many years," you politely
reply.</p>

<p>"What is your noble and exalted occupation?"</p>

<p>"My mean and contemptible calling is that of a doctor?"</p>

<p>"What is your noble patronymic?"</p>

<p>"My poverty-struck family name is Mo."</p>

<p>"How many honourable and distinguished sons have you?"</p>

<p>"Alas! Fate has been niggardly; I have not even one little
bug."</p>

<p>But, if you can truthfully say that you are the honourable
father of sons, your interlocutor will raise his clasped hands
and say gravely, "Sir, you are a man of virtue; I congratulate
you." He continues--</p>

<p>"How many tens of thousands of pieces of silver have you?"
meaning how many daughters have you?</p>

<p>"My yatows" (forked heads or slave children), "my daughters,"
you answer with a deprecatory shrug, "number so many."</p>

<p>So the conversation continues, and the more minute are the
inquiries the more polite is the questioner.</p>

<p>Unlike most of the Western nations, the Chinese have an
overmastering desire to have children. More than death itself the
Chinaman fears to die without leaving male progeny to worship at
his shrine; for, if he should die childless, he leaves behind him
no provision for his support in heaven, but wanders there a
hungry ghost, forlorn and forsaken--an "orphan" because he has no
children. "If one has plenty of money," says the Chinese proverb,
"but no children, he cannot be reckoned rich; if one has
children, but no money, he cannot be considered poor." To have
sons is a foremost virtue in China; "the greatest of the three
unfilial things," says Mencius "is to have no children."
(Mencius, iv., pt. i., 26).</p>

<p>In China longevity is the highest of the five grades of
felicity. Triumphal arches are erected all over the kingdom in
honour of those who have attained the patriarchal age which among
us seems only to be assured to those who partake in sufficient
quantity of certain fruit-salts and pills. Age when not known is
guessed by the length of the beard, which is never allowed to
grow till the thirty-second year. Now it happens that I am
clean-shaven, and, as it is a well-known fact that the face of
the European is an enigma to the Oriental, just as the face of
the Chinaman is an inscrutable mystery to most of us, I have
often been amused by the varying estimates of my age advanced by
curious bystanders. It has been estimated as low as twelve--"look
at the foreigner," they said, "there's a fine fat boy!"--and
never higher than twenty-two. But it is not only in China that a
youthful appearance has hampered me in my walk through life.</p>

<p>I remember that on one occasion, some years ago, I obliged a
medical friend by taking his practice while he went away for a
few days to be married. It was in a semi-barbarian village named
Portree, in a forgotten remnant of Scotland called the Isle of
Skye. The time was winter. The first case I was called to was
that of a bashful matron, the baker's wife, who had lately given
birth to her tenth child. I entered the room cheerfully. She
looked me over critically, and then greatly disconcerted me by
remarking that: "She was gey thankfu' to the Lord, that it was a'
by afore I cam', as she had nae wush to be meddled wi' by a
laddie o' nineteen." Yet I was two years older than the doctor
who had attended her.</p>

<p>If in China you are so fortunate as to be graced with a beard,
the Chinaman will add many years to your true age. In the
agreeable company of one of the finest men in China, I once made
a journey to the Nankow Pass in the Great Wall, north of Peking.
My friend had a beard like a Welsh bard's, and, though a younger
man than his years, forty-four, there was not a native who saw
him, who did not gaze upon him with awe, as a possible Buddha,
and not one who attributed to him an age less than eighty.</p>

<p>Next day, the 28th of April, despite my misgivings, my men
fulfilled their promise, and led me into Tali on the ninth day
out from Yunnan. We had come 307 miles in nine days. They walked
all the way, living frugally on scanty rations. I walked only 210
miles; I was better fed than they, and I had a pony at my hand
ready to carry me whenever I was tired.</p>

<p>My men thus earned a reward of eighteen pence each for doing
thirteen stages in nine days. Long before daylight we were on our
way. For miles and miles in the early morning we were climbing up
the mountains, till we reached a plateau where the wind blew
piercingly keen, and my fingers ached with the cold, and the
rarefaction in the atmosphere made breathing uneasy. The road was
lonely and un-irequented. We were accompanied by a muleteer who
knew the way, by his sturdy son of twelve, and his two pack
horses. By mid-day we had left the bare plateau, had passed the
three pagoda peaks, and were standing on the brow of a steep hill
overlooking the valleys of Chaochow and Tali. The plains were
studded with thriving villages, in rich fields, and intersected
with roadways lined with hedges. There on the left was the walled
city of Chaochow, beyond, to the right, was the great lake of
Tali, hemmed in by mountains, those beyond the lake thickly
covered with snow, and rising 7000 feet above the lake, which
itself is 7000 feet above the sea.</p>

<p>We descended into the valley, and, as we picked our way down
the steep path, I could count in the lap of the first valley
eighteen villages besides the walled city. Crossing the fields we
struck the main road, and mingled with the stream of people who
were bending their steps towards Hsiakwan. Many varieties of
feature were among them a diversity of type unlocked for by the
traveller in China who had become habituated to the uniformity of
type of the Chinese face. There were faces plainly European,
others as unmistakably Hindoo, Indigenes of Yunnan province,
Thibetans, Cantonese pedlars, and Szechuen coolies. A broad
flagged road brought us to the important market town of Hsiakwan,
which guards the southern pass to the Valley of Tali. It is on
the main road going west to the frontier of Burma, and is the
junction where the road turns north to Tali. It is a busy town.
It is one of the most famous halting places on the main road to
Burma. The two largest caravanserais in Western China are in
Hsiakwan, and I do not exaggerate when I say that a regiment of
British cavalry could be quartered in either of them. At a
restaurant near the cross-road we had rice and a cup of tea, and
a bowl of the vermicelli soup known as mien, the muleteer and his
son sitting down with my men. When the time came to go, the
muleteer, unrolling a string of cash from his waistband, was
about to pay his share, when Laohwan with much civility refused
to permit him. He insisted, but Laohwan was firm; had they been
Frenchmen, they could not have been more polite and
complimentary. The muleteer gave way with good grace, and Laohwan
paid with my cash, and gained merit by his courtesy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII. THECITYOFTALI--PRISONS--POISONING--PLAGUES AND
MISSIONS.</h3>

<p>Three hours later we were in Tali. A broad paved road, smooth
from the passage of countless feet, leads to the city. Rocky
creeks drain the mountain range into the lake; they are spanned
by numerous bridges of dressed stone, many of the slabs of which
are well cut granite blocks eighteen feet in length. At a stall
by the roadside excellent ices were for sale, genuine ices, made
of concave tablets of pressed snow sweetened with treacle,
costing one cash each--equal to one penny for three dozen. We
passed the Temple to the Goddess of Mercy, and entered Tali by
the south gate. Then by the yamen of the Titai and the Great Five
Glory Gate, the northern entrance of what was for seventeen years
the palace of the Mohammedan king during the rebellion, we turned
down the East street to the Yesu-tang, the Inland Mission, where
Mr. and Mrs. John Smith gave me a cordial greeting.</p>

<p>Tali has always been an important city. It was the capital of
an independent kingdom in the time of Kublai Khan and Marco Polo.
It was the headquarters of the Mohammedan Sultan or Dictator, Tu
Wen Hsiu, during the rebellion, and seemed at one time destined
to become the capital of an independent Moslem Empire in Western
China.</p>

<p>The city surrendered to the Mohammedans in 1857. It was
recaptured by the Imperialists under General Yang Yu-ko on
January 15th, 1873, the Chinese troops being aided by artillery
cast by Frenchmen in the arsenal of Yunnan and manned by French
gunners. At its recapture the carnage was appalling; the streets
were ankle-deep in blood. Of 50,000 inhabitants 30,000 were
butchered. After the massacre twenty-four panniers of human ears
were sent to Yunnan city to convince the people of the capital
that they had nothing more to fear from the rebellion.</p>

<p>In March, 1873, Yang was appointed Titai or Commander-in-chief
of Yunnan Province, with his headquarters in Tali, not in the
capital, and Tali has ever since been the seat of the most
important military command in the province.</p>

<p>The subsequent history of Yang may be told in a few words. He
assumed despotic power over the country he had conquered, and
grew in power till his authority became a menace to the Imperial
Government. They feared that he aspired to found a kingdom of his
own in Western China, and recalled him to Peking--to do him
honour. He was not to be permitted to return to Yunnan. At the
time of his recall another rebellion had broken out against
China--the rebellion of the French--and, like another Uriah, the
powerful general was sent to the forefront in Formosa, where he
was opportunely slain by a French bullet, or by a misdirected
Chinese one.</p>

<p>After his death it was found that Yang had made a noble
bequest to the City of Tali. During his residence he had built
for himself a splendid yamen of granite and marble. This he had
richly endowed and left as a free gift to the city as a college
for students. It is one of the finest residences in China, and,
though only seventy undergraduates were living there at the time
of my visit, the rooms could accommodate in comfort many
hundreds.</p>

<p>Tali is situated on the undulating ground that shelves gently
from the base of snow-clad mountains down to the lake. The lower
slopes of the mountain, above the town, are covered with myriads
of grave-mounds, which in the distance are scarcely
distinguishable from the granite blocks around them. Creeks and
rills of running water spring from the melting of the snows far
up the mountain, run among the grave-mounds, and are then trained
into the town. The Chinese residents thus enjoy the privilege of
drinking a diluted solution of their ancestors. Halfway to the
lake, there is a huge tumulus of earth and stone over-grown with
grass, in which are buried the bones of 10,000 Mohammedans who
fell during the massacre. There is no more fertile valley in the
world than the valley of Tali. It is studded with villages.
Between the two passes, Hsia-kwan on the south, and Shang-kwan on
the north, which are distant from each other a long day's walk,
there are 360 villages, each in its own plantation of trees, with
a pretty white temple in the centre with curved roof and upturned
gables. The sunny reaches of the lake are busy with fleets of
fishing boats. The poppy, grown in small pockets by the margin of
the lake, is probably unequalled in the world; the flowers, as I
walked through the fields, were on a level with my forehead.</p>

<p><b>SNOW-CLAD MOUNTAINS BEHIND TALIFU</b></p>
</center>

<p>Tali is not a large city; its wall is only three and a half
miles in circumference. Before the rebellion populous suburbs
extended half-way to Hsia-kwan, but they are now only heaps of
rubble. In the town itself there are market gardens and large
open spaces where formerly there were narrow streets of Chinese
houses. The wall is in fairly good repair, but there are no guns
in the town, except a few old-fashioned cannon lying half buried
in the ground near the north gate.</p>

<p>One afternoon we climbed up the mountain intending to reach a
famous cave, "The Phoenix-eyed Cave" (<i>Fung-yen-tung</i>) which
overlooks a precipice, of some fame in years gone by as a
favourite spot for suicides. We did not reach the cave. My energy
gave out when we were only halfway, so we sat down in the grass
and, to use a phrase that I fancy I have heard before, we feasted
our eyes on the scene before us. And here we gathered many
bunches of edelweiss.</p>

<p>As we were coming back down the hill, picking our way among
the graves, a pensive Chinaman stopped us to ask our assistance
in finding him a lucky spot in which to bury his father, who died
a year ago but was still above ground. He was sorry to hear that
we could not pretend to any knowledge of such things. He was of
an inquiring mind, for he then asked us if we had seen any
precious stones in the hillside--every Chinaman knows that the
foreigner with his blue eyes can see four feet underground--but
he was again disappointed with our reply, or did not believe
us.</p>

<p>At the poor old shrine to the God of Riches, half a dozen
Chinamen in need of the god's good offices were holding a small
feast in his honour. They had prepared many dishes and, having
"dedicated to the god the spiritual essence, were now about to
partake of the insipid remains." "Ching fan," they courteously
said to us when we approached down the path. "We invite (you to
take) rice." We raised our clasped hands: "<i>Ching, ching</i>,"
we replied "we invite (you to go on) we invite," and passed on.
They were bent upon enjoyment. They were taking as an
<i>aperitif</i> a preliminary cup of that awful spirit
<i>tsiu</i>, which is almost pure alcohol and can be burnt in
lamps like methylated spirit.</p>

<p>On the level sward, between this poor temple and the city, the
annual Thibetan Fair is held on the 17th, 18th, and 19th of
April, when caravans of Thibetans, with herds of ponies, make a
pilgrimage from their mountain villages to the ancient home of
their forefathers. But the fair is falling into disfavour owing
to the increasing number of likin-barriers on the northern trade
routes.</p>

<p>There are many temples in Tali. The finest is the Confucian
Temple, with its splendid halls and pavilions, in a beautiful
garden. Kwanti, the God of War, has also a temple worthy of a god
whose services to China in the past can never be forgotten. Every
Chinaman knows, that if it had not been for the personal aid of
this god, General Gordon could never have succeeded in
suppressing the Taiping rebellion. In the present rebellion of
the Japanese, the god appears to have maintained an attitude of
strict neutrality.</p>

<p>The City Temple is near the drill-ground. As the Temple of a
Fu city it contains the images of both Fu magistrate and Hsien
magistrate, with their attendants. In its precincts the
<i>Kwan</i> of the beggars, (the beggar king or headman), is
domiciled, who eats the Emperor's rice and is officially
responsible for the good conduct of the guild of beggars.</p>

<p>In the main street there is a Memorial Temple to General Yang,
who won the city back from the Mohammedans. But the temple where
prayer is offered most earnestly, is the small temple near the
Yesu-tang, erected to the goddess who has in her power the
dispensation of the pleasures of maternity. Rarely did I pass
here without seeing two or three childless wives on their knees,
praying to the goddess to remove from them the sin of
barrenness.</p>

<p>Some of the largest caravanserais I have seen in China are in
Tali. One of the largest belongs to the city, and is managed by
the authorities for the benefit of the poor, all profits being
devoted to a poor-relief fund. There are many storerooms here,
filled with foreign goods and stores imported from Burma, and
useful wares and ornamental nick-nacks brought from the West by
Cantonese pedlars. Prices are curiously low. I bought condensed
milk, "Milkmaid brand," for the equivalent of 7<i>d</i>. a tin.
In the inn there is stabling accommodation for more than a
hundred mules and horses, and there are rooms for as many
drivers. The tariff cannot be called immoderate. The charges are:
For a mule or horse per night, fodder included, one farthing; for
a man per night, a supper of rice included, one penny.</p>

<p>Even larger than the city inn is the caravanserai where my
pony was stabled; it is more like a barracks than an inn. One
afternoon the landlord invited the missionary and me into his
guest-room, and as I was the chief guest, he insisted, of course,
that I should occupy the seat of honour on the left hand. But I
was modest and refused to; he persisted and I was reluctant; he
pushed me forward and I held back, protesting against the honour
he wished to show me. But he would take no refusal and pressed me
forward into the seat. I showed becoming reluctance of course,
but I would not have occupied any other. By-and-by he introduced
to me with much pride his aged father, to whom, when he came into
the room, I insisted upon giving my seat, and humbly sat on an
inferior seat by his side, showing him all the consideration due
to his eighty years. The old man bore an extraordinary
resemblance to Moltke. He had smoked opium, he told Mr. Smith,
the missionary, for fifty years, but always in moderation. His
daily allowance was two chien of raw opium, rather more than
one-fifth of an ounce, but he knew many Chinese, he told the
missionary, who smoked daily five times as much opium as he did
without apparent injury.</p>

<p>In Tali there are four chief officials: the Prefect or Fu
Magistrate, the Hsien or City Magistrate, the Intendant or
Taotai, and the Titai. The yamen of the Taotai is a humble
residence for so important an official; but the yamen of the
Titai, between the South Gate and the Five Glory Tower, is one of
the finest in the province. The Titai is not only the chief
military commander of the province of Yunnan, but he is a very
much married man. An Imperialist, he has yet obeyed the
Mahommedan injunction and taken to himself four wives in order to
be sure of obtaining one good one. He has been abundantly blessed
with children. In offices at the back of the Titai's yamen and
within its walls, is the local branch of the Imperial Chinese
telegraphs, conducted by two Chinese operators, who can read and
write English a little, and can speak crudely a few
sentences.</p>

<p>The City Magistrate is an advanced opium-smoker, a slave to
the pipe, who neglects his duties. In his yamen I saw the wooden
cage in which prisoners convicted of certain serious crimes are
slowly done to death by starvation and exhaustion, as well as the
wooden cages of different shape in which criminals of another
class condemned to death, are carried to and from the
capital.</p>

<p>The City prison is in the Hsien's yamen, but permission to
enter was refused me, though the missionary has frequently been
admitted. "The prison," explained the Chinese clerk, "is private,
and strangers cannot be admitted." I was sorry not to be allowed
to see the prison, all the more because I had heard from the
missionary nothing but praise of the humanity and justice of its
management.</p>

<p>The gaols of China, or, as the Chinese term them, the "hells,"
just as the prison hulks in England forty years ago were known as
"floating hells," have been universally condemned for the
cruelties and deprivations practised in them. They are probably
as bad as were the prisons of England in the early years of the
present century.</p>

<p>The gaolers purchase their appointments, as they did in
England in the time of John Howard; and, as was the case in
England, they receive no other pay than what they can squeeze
from the prisoners or the prisoners' friends. Poor and
friendless, the prisoners fare badly. But I question if the
cruelties practised in the Chinese gaols, allowing for the
blunted nerve sensibility of the Chinaman, are less endurable
than the condition of things existing in English prisons so
recently as when Charles Reade wrote "It is Never Too Late to
Mend." The cruelties of Hawes, the "punishment jacket," the
crank, the dark cell, and starvation, "the living tortured, the
dying abandoned, the dead kicked out of the way;" when boys of
fifteen, like Josephs, were driven to self-slaughter by cruelty.
These are statements published in 1856, "every detail of which
was verified, every fact obtained, by research and observation."
("Life of Charles Reade," ii., 33.)</p>

<p>And it cannot admit, I think, of question that there are no
cruelties practised in the Chinese gaols greater, even if there
are any equal to the awful and degraded brutality with which the
England of our fathers treated her convicts in the penal
settlements of Norfolk Island, Port Arthur, Macquarie Harbour,
and the prison hulks of Williamstown. "The convict settlements
were terrible cesspools of iniquity, so bad that it seemed, to
use the words of one who knew them well, 'the heart of man who
went to them was taken from him, and there was given to him the
heart of a beast.'"</p>

<p>Can the mind conceive of anything more dreadful in China than
the incident narrated by the Chaplain of Norfolk Island, the Rev.
W. Ullathorne, D.D., afterwards Roman Catholic Bishop of
Birmingham, in his evidence before the Commission of the House of
Commons in 1838: "As I mentioned the names of those men who were
to die, they one after another, as their names were pronounced,
dropped on their knees and thanked God that they were to be
delivered from that horrible place, whilst the others remained
standing mute, weeping. It was the most horrible scene I have
ever witnessed."</p>

<p>Those who have read Marcus Clarke's "For the Term of His
Natural Life," remember the powerfully-drawn character of Maurice
Frere, the Governor of Norfolk Island. It is well known, of
course, that the story is founded upon fact, and is a perfectly
true picture of the convict days. The original of Maurice Frere
is known to have been the late Colonel, who was killed by the
convicts in the prison hulk "Success," at Williamstown, in 1853.
To this day there is no old lag that was ever exposed to his
cruelty but reviles his memory. I once knew the convict who gave
the signal for his murder. He was sentenced to death, but was
reprieved and served a long term of imprisonment. The murder
happened forty-one years ago, yet to this day the old convict
commends the murder as a just act of retribution, and when he
narrates the story he tells you with bitter passion that the
"Colonel's dead, and, if there's a hell, he's frizzling there
yet."</p>

<p>Captain Foster Fyans, a former Governor of Norfolk Island
Convict Settlement, spent the last years of his life in the town
I belong to, Geelong, in Victoria. The cruelties imposed on the
convicts under his charge were justified, he declared, by the
brutalised character of the prisoners. On one occasion, he used
to tell, a band of convicts attempted to escape from the Island;
but their attempt was frustrated by the guard. The twelve
convicts implicated in the outbreak were put on their trial,
found guilty, and sentenced to death by strangulation, as hanging
really was in those days. Word was sent to headquarters in
Sydney, and instructions were asked for to carry the sentence
into effect. The laconic order was sent back from Sydney to "hang
half of them." The Captain acknowledged the humour of the
despatch, though it placed him in a difficulty. Which half should
he hang, when all were equally guilty? In his pleasant way the
Captain used to tell how he acted in the dilemma. He went round
to the twelve condemned wretches, and asked each man separately
if, being under sentence of death, he desired a reprieve or
wished for death. As luck would have it, of the twelve men, six
pleaded for life and six as earnestly prayed that they might be
sent to the scaffold. So the Captain hanged the six men who
wished to live, and spared the six men who prayed for death to
release them from their awful misery. This is an absolutely true
story, which I have heard from men to whom the Captain himself
told it. Besides, it bears on its face the impress of truth. And
yet we are accustomed to speak of the Chinese as centuries behind
us in civilisation and humanity.</p>

<p>I went to two opium-poisoning cases in Tali, both being cases
of attempted suicide. The first was that of an old man living not
at the South Gate as the messenger assured us, who feared to
discourage us if he told the truth, but more than a mile beyond
it. On our way we bought in the street some sulphate of copper,
and a large dose made the old man so sick that he said he would
never take opium again, and, if he did, he would not send for the
foreign gentleman.</p>

<p>The other was that of a young bride, a girl of unusual
personal attraction, only ten days married, who thus early had
become weary of the pock-marked husband her parents had sold her
to. She was dressed still in her bridal attire, which had not
been removed since marriage; she was dressed in red--the colour
of happiness. "She was dressed in her best, all ready for the
journey," and was determined to die, because dead she could repay
fourfold the injuries which she had received while living. In
this case many neighbours were present, and, as all were anxious
to prevent the liberation of the girl's evil spirit, I proved to
them how skilful are the barbarian doctors. The bride was induced
to drink hot water till it was, she declared, on a level with her
neck, then I gave her a hypodermic injection of that wonderful
emetic apomorphia. The effect was very gratifying to all but the
patient.</p>

<p>Small-pox, or, as the Chinese respectfully term it, "Heavenly
Flowers," is a terrible scourge in Western China. It is estimated
that two thousand deaths--there is a charming vagueness about all
Chinese figures--from this disease alone occur in the course of a
year in the valley of Tali. Inoculation is practised, as it has
been for many centuries, by the primitive method of introducing a
dried pock-scab, on a lucky day, into one of the nostrils. The
people have heard of the results of Western methods of
inoculation, and immense benefit could be conferred upon a very
large community by sending to the Inland Mission in Talifu a few
hundred tubes of vaccine lymph. Vaccination introduced into
Western China would be a means, the most effective that could be
imagined, to check the death rate over that large area of country
which was ravaged by the civil war, and whose reduced population
is only a small percentage of the population which so fertile a
country needs for its development. Infanticide is hardly known in
that section of Yunnan of which Tali may be considered the
capital. Small-pox kills the children. There is no need for a
mother to sacrifice her superfluous children, for she has
none.</p>

<p>Another disease endemic in Yunnan is the bubonic plague, which
is, no doubt, identical with the plague that has lately played
havoc in Hong Kong and Canton. Cantonese peddlers returning to
the coast probably carried the germs with them.</p>

<p>The China Inland Mission in Tali was the last of the mission
stations which I was to see on my journey. This is the furthest
inland of the stations of the Inland Mission in China. It was
opened in 1881 by Mr. George W. Clarke, the most
widely-travelled, with the single exception of the late Dr.
Cameron, of all the pioneer missionaries of this brave society; I
think Mr. Clarke told me that he has been in fourteen out of the
eighteen provinces. His work here was not encouraging; he was
treated with kindness by the Chinese, but they refused to accept
the truth when he placed it before them.</p>

<p>"For the Bible and the Light of Truth," says Miss Guinness, in
her charming but hysterical "Letters from the Far East"--a book
that has deluded many poor girls to China--"For the Bible and the
Light of Truth the Chinese cry with outstretched, empty, longing
hands" (p. 173). But this allegation unhappily conflicts with
facts when applied to Tali.</p>

<p>For the first eleven years the mission laboured here without
any success whatever; but now a happier time seems coming, and no
less than three converts have been baptised in the last two
years.</p>

<p>There are now three missionaries in Tali--there are usually
four; they are universally respected by the Chinese; they have
made their little mission home one of the most charming in China.
Mr. John Smith, who succeeded Mr. Clarke, has been ten years in
Tali. He is welcomed everywhere, and in every case of serious
sickness or opium-poisoning he is sent for. During all the time
he has been in Tali he has never refused to attend a summons to
the sick, whether by day or night. In the course of the year he
attends, on an average, between fifty and sixty cases of
attempted suicide by opium in the town or its environs, and, if
called in time, he is rarely unsuccessful. Should he be called to
a case outside the city wall and be detained after dark, the city
gate will be kept open for him till he returns. The city
magistrate has himself publicly praised the benevolence of this
missionary, and said, "there is no man in Tali like Mr.
Smith--would that there were others!" He is a Christian in word
and deed, brave and simple, unaffected and sympathetic--the type
of missionary needed in China--an honour to his mission. I saw
the courageous man working here almost alone, far distant from
all Western comforts, cut off from the world, and almost unknown,
and I contrasted him with those other missionaries--the
majority--who live in luxurious mission-houses in absolute safety
in the treaty ports, yet whose courage and self-denial we have
accustomed ourselves to praise in England and America, when with
humble voices they parade the dangers they undergo and the
hardships they endure in preaching, dear friends, to the
"perishing heathen in China, God's lost ones!"</p>

<p>In addition to the three converts who have been baptised in
Tali in the last two years, there are two inquirers--one the
mission cook--who are nearly ready for acceptance. At the Sunday
service I met the three converts. One is the paid teacher in the
mission school; another is a humble pedlar; the third is a
courageous native belonging to one of the indigenous tribes of
Western China, a Minchia man, whose conversion, judged by all
tests, is one of those genuine cases which bring real joy to the
missionary. He has only recently been baptised. Every Sunday he
comes in fifteen li from the small patch of ground he tills to
the mission services. His son is at the mission school, and is
boarded on the premises. There is a small school in connection
with the mission under the baptised teacher, where eight boys and
eight girls are being taught. They are learning quickly, their
wonderful gifts of memory being a chief factor in their progress.
At the service there was another worshipper, a sturdy boy of
fourteen, who slept composedly all through the exhortation. If
any boy should feel gratitude towards the kind missionaries it is
he. They have reared him from the most degraded poverty, have
taught him to read and write, and are now on the eve of
apprenticing him to a carpenter. He was a beggar boy, the son of
a professional beggar, who, with unkempt hair and in rags and
filth, used to shamble through the streets gathering reluctant
alms. The father died, and some friends would have sold his son
to pay the expenses of his burial; but the missionaries
intervened and, to save the son from slavery, buried his father.
This action gave them some claim to help the boy, and the boy has
accordingly been with them since in a comfortable, kindly home,
instead of grovelling round the streets in squalor and
nakedness.</p>

<p>The mission-house, formerly occupied by Mr. George Clarke is
near the City Temple. We went to see it a day or two after my
arrival. It is now in the possession of a family of Mohammedans,
one of the very few Moslem families still living in the valley of
Tali. "When we were in possession of the valley," said the father
sorrowfully, "we numbered '12,000 tens' (120,000 souls), now we
are '100 fives' (500 souls). Our men were slain, our women were
taken in prey, only a remnant escaped the destroyer." Several
members of the family were in the court when we entered, and
among the men were three with marked Anglo-Saxon features, a
peculiarity frequently seen in Western China, where every
traveller has given a different explanation of the phenomenon.
One especially moved my curiosity, for he possessed to an absurd
degree the closest likeness to myself. Could I give him any
higher praise than that?</p>

<p>That the Mohammedan Chinese is physically superior to his
Buddhist countryman is acknowledged by all observers; there is a
fearlessness and independence of bearing in the Mohammedan, a
militant carriage that distinguishes him from the Chinese
unbeliever. His religion is but a thinly diluted Mohammedanism,
and excites the scorn of the true believers from India who
witness his devotion, or rather his want of devotion.</p>

<p>One of the men talking to us in the old mission-house was a
comical-looking fellow, whose head-dress differed from that of
the other Chinese, in that, in addition to his queue, lappets of
hair were drawn down his cheeks in the fashion affected by old
ladies in England. I raised these strange locks--impudent
curiosity is often polite attention in China--whereupon the
reason for them was apparent. The body bequeathed to him by his
fathers had been mutilated--he had suffered the removal of both
ears. He explained to us how he came to lose them, but we knew
even before he told us; "he had lost them in battle facing the
enemy "--and of course we believed him. The less' credulous would
associate the mutilation with a case of theft and its detection
and punishment by the magistrate; but "a bottle-nosed man," says
the Chinese proverb, "may be a teetotaller and yet no one will
think so." Our milkman at the mission was a follower of the
Prophet, and the milk he gave us was usually as reduced in
quality as are his co-religionists in number. In the milk he
supplied there was what a chemist describes as a remarkable
absence of butter fat. Yet, when he was reproached for his
deceit, he used piously to say, even when met coming from the
well, "I could not put a drop of water in the milk, for there is
a God up there"--and he would jerk his chin towards the sky--"who
would see me if I did."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII. THE JOURNEY FROM TALI, WITH SOME REMARKS ON
THE CHARACTER OF THE CANTONESE, CHINESE EMIGRANTS, CRETINS, AND
WIFE-BEATING IN CHINA.</h3>

<p>The three men who had come with me the six hundred and
seventeen miles from Chaotong left me at Tali to return all that
long way home on foot with their well-earned savings. I was sorry
to say good-bye to them; but they had come many miles further
than they intended, and their friends, they said, would be
anxious: besides Laohwan, you remember, was newly married.</p>

<p>I engaged three new men in their places. They were to take me
right through to Singai (Bhamo). Every day was of importance now
with four hundred and fifty miles to travel and the rainy season
closing in. Laotseng was the name of the Chinaman whom I engaged
in place of Laohwan. He was a fine young fellow, active as a
deer, strong, and high-spirited. I agreed to pay him the fancy
wage of 24<i>s</i>. for the journey. He was to carry no load, but
undertook, in the event of either of my coolies falling sick, to
carry his load until a new coolie could be engaged. The two
coolies I engaged through a coolie-hong. One was a strongly-built
man, a "chop dollar," good-humoured, but of rare ugliness. The
other was the thinnest man I ever saw outside a Bowery dime-show.
He had the opium habit. He was an opium-eater rather than an
opium-smoker; and he ate the ash from the opium-pipe, instead of
the opium itself--the most vicious of the methods of taking
opium. He was the nearest approach I saw in China to the Exeter
Hall type of opium-eater, whose "wasted limbs and palsied hands"
cry out against the sin of the opium traffic. Though a victim of
the injustice of England, this man had never tasted Indian opium
in his life, and, perishing as he was in body and soul, going
"straight to eternal damnation," his "dying wail unheard," he yet
undertook a journey that would have deterred the majority of
Englishmen, and agreed to carry, at forced speed, a far heavier
load than the English soldier is ever weighted with on march. The
two coolies were to be paid 4 taels each (12<i>s</i>.) for the
twenty stages to Singai, and had to find their own board and
lodging. But I also stipulated to give them <i>churo</i> money
(pork money) of 100 cash each at three places--Yung-chang,
Tengyueh, and Bhamo--100 cash each a day extra for every day that
I detained them on the way, and, in addition, I was to reward
them with 150 cash each a day for every day that they saved on
the twenty days' journey, days that I rested not to count.</p>

<p>Of course none of the three men spoke a word of English. All
were natives of the province of Szechuen, and all carried out
their agreement to the letter.</p>

<p>On May 3rd I left Tali. The last and longest stage of all the
journey was before me, a distance of some hundreds of miles,
which I had to traverse before I could hope to meet another
countryman or foreigner with whom I could converse. The two
missionaries, Mr. Smith and Mr. Graham, kindly offered to see me
on my way, and we all started together for Hsiakwan, leaving the
men to follow.</p>

<p>Ten li from Tali we stopped to have tea at one of the many
tea-houses that are grouped round the famous temple to the
Goddess of Mercy, the <i>Kwanyin-tang</i>. The scene was an
animated one. The open space between the temple steps and the
temple theatre opposite was thronged with Chinese of strange
diversity of feature crying their wares from under the shelter of
huge umbrellas. There is always a busy traffic to Hsiakwan, and
every traveller rests here, if only for a few minutes. For this
is the most famous temple in the valley of Tali. The Goddess of
Mercy is the friend of travellers, and no thoughtful Chinese
should venture on a journey without first asking the favour of
the goddess and obtaining from her priests a forecast of his
success. The temple is a fine specimen of Chinese architecture.
It was built specially to record a miracle. In the chief court,
surrounded by the temple buildings, there is a huge granite
boulder lying in an ornamental pond. It is connected by marble
approaches, and is surmounted by a handsome monument of marble,
which is faced on all sides with memorial tablets. This boulder
was carried to its present position by the goddess herself, the
monument and bridges were built to detain it where it lay, and
the temple afterwards erected to commemorate an event of such
happy augury for the beautiful valley.</p>

<p><b>MEMORIAL IN THE TEMPLE OF THE GODDESS OF MERCY NEAR
TALI-FU</b></p>
</center>

<p>But the temple has not always witnessed only scenes of mercy.
Two years ago a tragedy was enacted here of strange interest. At
a religious festival held here in April, 1892, and attended by
all the high officials and by a crowd of sightseers, a thief,
taking advantage of the crush, tried to snatch a bracelet from
the wrist of a young woman, and, when she resisted, he stabbed
her. He was seized red-handed, dragged before the Titai, who
happened to be present, and ordered to be beheaded there and
then. An executioner was selected from among the soldiers; but so
clumsily did he do the work, hacking the head off by repeated
blows, instead of severing it by one clean cut, that the friends
of the thief were incensed and vowed vengeance. That same night
they lay in wait for the executioner as he was returning to the
city, and beat him to death with stones. Five men were arrested
for this crime; they were compelled to confess their guilt and
were sentenced to death. As they were being carried out to the
execution-ground, one of the condemned pointed to two men, who
were in the crowd of sightseers, and swore that they were equally
concerned in the murder. So these two men were also put on their
trial, with the result that one was found guilty and was equally
condemned to death. As if this were not sufficient, at the
execution the mother of one of the prisoners, when she saw her
son's head fall beneath the knife, gave a loud scream and fell
down stone-dead. Nine lives were sacrificed in this tragedy: the
woman who was stabbed recovered of her wound.</p>

<p>Hsiakwan was crowded, as it was market day. We had lunch
together at a Chinese restaurant, and then, my men having come
up, the kind missionaries returned, and I went on alone. A river,
the Yangki River, drains the Tali Lake, and, leaving the
south-west corner of the lake, flows through the town of
Hsiakwan, and so on west to join the Mekong. For three days the
river would be our guide. A mile from the town the river enters a
narrow defile, where steep walls of rock rise abruptly from the
banks. The road here passes under a massive gateway. Forts, now
dismantled, guard the entrance; the pass could be made absolutely
impregnable. At this point the torrent falls under a natural
bridge of unusual beauty.</p>

<p>We rode on by the narrow bank along the river, crossed from
the left to the right bank, and continued on through a beautiful
country, sweet with the scent of the honeysuckle, to the charming
little village of Hokiangpu. Here we had arranged to stay. The
inn was a large one, and very clean. Many of its rooms were
already occupied by a large party of Cantonese returning home
after the Thibetan Fair with loads of opium.</p>

<p>The Cantonese, using the term in its broader sense as applied
to the natives of the province of Kuangtung, are the Catalans of
China. They are as enterprising as the Scotch, adapt themselves
as readily to circumstances, are enduring, canny, and successful;
you meet them in the most distant parts of China. They make
wonderful pilgrimages on foot. They have the reputation of being
the most quick-witted of all Chinese. Large numbers come to Tali
during the Thibetan Fair, and in the opium season. They bring all
kinds of foreign goods adapted for Chinese wants--cheap pistols
and revolvers, mirrors, scales, fancy pictures, and a thousand
gewgaws useful as well as attractive--and they return with opium.
They travel in bands, marching in single file, their carrying
poles pointed with a steel spearhead two feet long, serving a
double use--a carrying pole in peace, a formidable spear in
trouble.</p>

<p>Everywhere they can be distinguished by their dress, by their
enormous oiled sunshades, and by their habit of tricing their
loads high up to the carrying pole. They are always well clad in
dark blue; their heads are always cleanly shaved; their feet are
well sandalled, and their calves neatly bandaged. They have a
travelled mien about them, and carry themselves with an air of
conscious superiority to the untravelled savages among whom they
are trading. To me they were always polite and amiable; they
recognised that I was, like themselves, a stranger far from
home.</p>

<p>This is the class of Chinese who, emigrating from the
thickly-peopled south-eastern provinces of China, already possess
a predominant share of the wealth of Borneo, Sumatra, Java,
Timor, the Celebes and the Philippine Islands, Burma, Siam, Annam
and Tonquin, the Straits Settlements, Malay Peninsula, and Cochin
China. "There is hardly a tiny islet visited by our naturalists
in any part of these seas but Chinamen are found." And it is this
class of Chinese who have already driven us out of the Northern
Territory of Australia, and whose unrestricted entry into the
other colonies we must prevent at all hazards. We cannot compete
with Chinese; we cannot intermix or marry with them; they are
aliens in language, thought, and customs; they are working
animals of low grade but great vitality. The Chinese is
temperate, frugal, hard-working, and law-evading, if not
law-abiding--we all acknowledge that. He can outwork an
Englishman, and starve him out of the country--no one can deny
that. To compete successfully with a Chinaman, the artisan or
labourer of our own flesh and blood would require to be degraded
into a mere mechanical beast of labour, unable to support wife or
family, toiling seven days in the week, with no amusements,
enjoyments, or comforts of any kind, no interest in the country,
contributing no share towards the expense of government, living
on food that he would now reject with loathing, crowded with his
fellows ten or fifteen in a room that he would not now live in
alone, except with repugnance. Admitted freely into Australia,
the Chinese would starve out the Englishman, in accordance with
the law of currency--that of two currencies in a country the
baser will always supplant the better. "In Victoria," says
Professor Pearson, "a single trade--that of furniture-making--was
taken possession of and ruined for white men within the space of
something like five years." In the small colony of Victoria there
are 9377 Chinese in a population of 1,150,000; in all China, with
its population of 350,000,000, there are only 8081 foreigners
(Dyer Ball), a large proportion of whom are working for China's
salvation.</p>

<p>There is not room for both in Australia. Which is to be our
colonist, the Asiatic or the Englishman?</p>

<p>In the morning we had another beautiful walk round the
snow-clad mountains to the village of Yangpi, at the back of
Tali. There was a long delay here. News of my arrival spread, and
the people hurried along to see me. No sooner was I seated at an
inn than two messengers from the yamen called for my passport.
They were officious young fellows, sadly wanting in respect, and
they asked for my passport in a noisy way that I did not like, so
I would not understand them. I only smiled at them in the most
friendly manner possible. I kept them for some time in a fever of
irritation at their inability to make me understand; I listened
with imperturbable calmness to their excited phrases till they
were nearly dancing. Then I leisurely produced my passport, as if
to satisfy a curiosity of my own, and began scanning it. Seeing
this, they rudely thrust forth their hands to seize it; but I had
my eye on them. "Not so quick, my friends," I said, soothingly.
"Be calm; nervous irritability is a fruitful source of trouble.
See, here is my passport; here is the official seal, and here the
name of your unworthy servant. Now I fold it up carefully and put
it back in my pocket. But here is a copy, which is at your
service. If you wish to show the original to the magistrate, I
will take it to his honour myself, but out of my hands it does
not pass." They looked puzzled, as they did not understand
English; they debated a minute or two, and then went away with
the copy, which in due time they politely returned to me.</p>

<p>If you wish to travel quickly in China, never be in a hurry.
Appear unconscious of all that is passing; never be irritated by
any delay, and assume complete indifference, even when you are
really anxious to push on. Emulate, too, that leading trait in
the Chinese character, and never understand anything which you do
not wish to understand. No man on earth can be denser than a
Chinaman, when he chooses.</p>

<p>Let me give an instance. It was not so long ago, in a police
court in Melbourne, that a Chinaman was summoned for being in
possession of a tenement unfit for human habitation. The case was
clearly proved, and he was fined 1 pound. But in no way could
John be made to understand that a fine had been inflicted. He sat
there with unmoved stolidity, and all that the court could
extract from him was: "My no savvy, no savvy." After saying this
in a voice devoid of all hope, he sank again into silence. Here
rose a well-known lawyer. "With your worship's permission, I
think I can make the Chinaman understand," he said. He was
permitted to try. Striding fiercely up to the poor Celestial, he
said to him, in a loud voice, "John, you are fined two pounds."
"No dam fear! Only one!"</p>

<p>Crossing now the river by a well-constructed suspension
bridge, we had a fearful climb of 2000 feet up the mountain. My
coolie "Bones" nearly died on the way. Then there was a rough
descent by a jagged path down the rocky side of the
mountain-river to the village of Taiping-pu. It was long after
dark when we arrived; and an hour later stalked in the gaunt form
of poor "Bones," who, instead of eating a good meal coiled up on
the kang and smoked an opium-pipe that he borrowed from the
chairen. All the next day, and, indeed for every day till we
reached Tengyueh, our journey was one of the most arduous I have
ever known. The road has to surmount in succession parallel
ridges of mountains. The road is never even, for it cannot remain
where travelling is easiest, but must continually dip from the
crest of the ranges to the depths of the valleys.</p>

<p>Shortly before reaching Huanglien-pu my pony cast a shoe, and
it was some time before we were able to have it seen to; but I
had brought half a dozen spare shoes with me, and by-and-by a
muleteer came along who fixed one on as neatly as any farrier
could have done, and gladly accepted a reward of one halfpenny.
He kept the foot steady while shoeing it by lashing the fetlock
to the pony's tail.</p>

<p>Caravans of cotton coming from Burma were meeting us all day.
Miles away the booming of their gongs sounded in the silent
hills; a long time afterwards their bells were heard jingling,
and by-and-by the mules and horses appeared under their huge
bales of cotton, the foremost decorated with scarlet tufts and
plumes of pheasant tails, the last carrying the saddle and
bedding of the headman, as well as the burly headman himself,
perched above all. A man with a gong always headed the way; there
was a driver to every five animals. In the sandy bed of the river
at one place a caravan was resting. Their packs were piled in
parallel rows; their horses browsed on the hillside. I counted
107 horses in this one caravan.</p>

<p>The prevailing pathological feature of the Chinese of Western
Yunnan is the deformity goitre. It may safely be asserted that it
is as common in many districts as are the marks of small-pox.
Goitre occurs widely in Annam, Siam, Upper Burma, the Shan
States, and in Western China as far as the frontier of Thibet. It
is distinctly associated with cretinism and its interrupted
intellectual development. And the disease must increase, for
there is no attempt to check it. To be a "thickneck" is no bar to
marriage on either side. The goitrous intermarry, and have
children who are goitrous, or, rather, who will, if exposed to
the same conditions as their parents, inevitably develop goitre.
Frequently the disease is intensified in the offspring into
cretinism, and I can conceive of no sight more disgusting than
that which so often met our view, of a goitrous mother suckling
her imbecile child. On one afternoon, among those who passed us
on the road, I counted eighty persons with the deformity. On
another day nine adults were climbing a path, by which we had
just descended, every one of whom had goitre. In one small
village, out of eighteen full-grown men and women whom I met in
the street down which I rode, fifteen were affected. My diary in
the West, especially from Yunnan City to Yungchang, after which
point the cases greatly diminished in number, became a monotonous
record of cases. At the mission in Tali three women are employed,
and of these two are goitrous; the third, a Minchia woman, is
free from the disease, and I have been told that among the
indigenes the disease is much less common than among the Chinese.
On all sides one encounters the horrible deformity, among all
classes, of all ages. The disease early manifests itself, and I
have often seen well-marked enlargement in children as young as
eight.</p>

<p>Turn any street corner in any town of importance in Western
Yunnan and you will meet half a dozen cases; there must be few
families in the western portion of the province free from the
taint.</p>

<p>On a day, for example, like this (May 5th), when the road was
more than usually mountainous, though that may have been an
accident, my chairen was a "thickneck" and my two soldiers were
"thicknecks." At the village of Huang-lien-pu, where I had lunch,
the landlady of the inn had a goitrous neck that was swelled out
half-way to the shoulder, and her son was a slobbering-mouthed
cretin with the intelligence of an animal. And among the people
who gathered round me in a dull, apathetic way every other one
was more or less marked with the disease and its attendant mental
phenomena. Again, at the inn in a little mountain village, where
we stopped for the night, mother, father, and every person in the
house, to the number of nine, above the age of childhood was
either goitrous or cretinous, dull of intelligence, mentally
verging upon dementia in three cases, in two of which physical
growth had been arrested at childhood.</p>

<p>Rarely during my journey to Burma was I offended by hearing
myself called "Yang kweitze" (foreign devil), although this is
the universal appellation of the foreigner wherever Mandarin is
spoken in China. Today, however, (May 6th), I was seated at the
inn in the town of Chutung when I heard the offensive term. I was
seated at a table in the midst of the accustomed crowd of
Chinese. I was on the highest seat, of course, because I was the
most important person present, when a bystander, seeing that I
spoke no Chinese, coolly said the words "Yang kweitze" (foreign
devil), I rose in my wrath, and seized my whip. "You Chinese
devil" (Chung kweitze), I said in Chinese, and then I assailed
him in English. He seemed surprised at my warmth, but said
nothing, and, turning on his heel, walked uncomfortably away.</p>

<p>I often regretted afterwards that I did not teach the man a
lesson, and cut him across the face with my whip; yet, had I done
so, it would have been unjust. He called me, as I thought, "Yang
kweitze," but I have no doubt, having told the story to Mr.
Warry, the Chinese adviser to the Government of Burma, that he
did not use these words at all, but others so closely resembling
them that they sounded identically the same to my untrained ear,
and yet signified not "foreign devil," but "honoured guest." He
had paid me a compliment; he had not insulted me. The Yunnanese,
Mr. Warry tells me, do not readily speak of the devil for fear he
should appear.</p>

<p>On my journey I made it a rule, acting advisedly, to refuse to
occupy any other than the best room in the inn, and, if there was
only one room, I required that the best bed in the room, as
regards elevation, should be given to me. So, too, at every inn I
insisted that the best table should be given me, and, if there
were already Chinese seated at it, I gravely bowed to them, and
by a wave of my hand signified that it was my pleasure that they
should make way for the distinguished stranger. When there was
only the one table, I occupied, as by right, its highest seat,
refusing to sit in any other. I required, indeed, by politeness
and firmness, that the Chinese take me at my own valuation. And
they invariably did so. They always gave way to me. They
recognised that I must be a traveller of importance, despite the
smallness of my retinue and the homeliness of my attire; and they
acknowledged my superiority. Had I been content with a humbler
place, it would quickly have been reported along the road, and,
little by little, my complacence would have been tested. I am
perfectly sure that, by never verging from my position of
superiority, I gained the respect of the Chinese and it is
largely to this I attribute the universal respect and attention
shown me during the journey. For I was unarmed, entirely
dependent upon the Chinese, and, for all practical purposes,
inarticulate. As it was, I never had any difficulty whatever.</p>

<p>Chinese etiquette pays great attention to the question of
position; so important indeed, is it that, when a carriage was
taken by Lord Macartney's Embassy to Peking as a present, or, as
the Chinese said, as tribute to the Emperor Kienlung, great
offence was caused by the arrangement of the seats requiring the
driver to sit on a higher level than His Majesty. A small enough
mistake surely, but sufficient to mar the success of an
expedition which the Chinese have always regarded as "one of the
most splended testimonials of respect that a tributary nation
ever paid their Court."</p>

<p>On the morning of May 7th, as we were leaving the village
where we had slept the night before, we were witnesses of a
domestic quarrel which might well have become a tragedy. On the
green outside their cabin a husband with goitre, enraged against
his goitrous wife, was kept from killing her by two elderly
goitrous women. All were speaking with horrible goitrous voices
as if they had cleft palates, and the husband was hoarse with
fury. Jealousy could not have been the cause of the quarrel, for
his wife was one of the most hideous creatures I have seen in
China. Throwing aside the bamboo with which he was threatening
her, the husband ran to the house, and was out again in a moment
brandishing a lone native sword with which he menaced speedy
death to the joy of his existence. I stood in the road and
watched the disturbance, and with me the soldier-guard, who did
not venture to interfere. But the two women seized the angry
brute and held him till his wife toddled round the corner. Now,
if this were a determined woman, she could best revenge herself
for the cruelty that had been done her by going straightway and
poisoning herself with opium, for then would her spirit be
liberated, ever after to haunt her husband, even if he escaped
punishment for being the cause of her death. If in the dispute he
had killed her, he would be punished with "strangulation after
the usual period," the sentence laid down by the law and often
recorded in the Peking Gazette (e.g., May 15th, 1892), unless he
could prove her guilty of infidelity, or want of filial respect
for his parents, in which case his action would be praiseworthy
rather than culpable. If, however, in the dispute the wife had
killed her husband, or by her conduct had driven him to suicide,
she would be inexorably tied to the cross and put to death by the
"Ling chi," or "degrading and slow process." For a wife to kill
her husband has always been regarded as a more serious crime than
for a husband to kill his wife; even in our own highly favoured
country, till within a few years of the present century, the
punishment for the man was death by hanging, but in the case of
the woman death by burning alive.</p>

<p>Let me at this point interpolate a word or two about the
method of execution known as the Ling chi. The words are
commonly, and quite wrongly, translated as "death by slicing into
10,000 pieces"--a truly awful description of a punishment whose
cruelty has been extraordinarily misrepresented. It is true that
no punishment is more dreaded by the Chinese than the <i>Ling
chi</i>; but it is dreaded, not because of any torture associated
with its performance, but because of the dismemberment practised
upon the body which was received whole from its parents. The
mutilation is ghastly and excites our horror as an example of
barbarian cruelty; but it is not cruel, and need not excite our
horror, since the mutilation is done, not before death, but
after. The method is simply the following, which I give as I
received it first-hand from an eye-witness:--The prisoner is tied
to a rude cross: he is invariably deeply under the influence of
opium. The executioner, standing before him, with a sharp sword
makes two quick incisions above the eyebrows, and draws down the
portion of skin over each eye, then he makes two more quick
incisions across the breast, and in the next moment he pierces
the heart, and death is instantaneous. Then he cuts the body in
pieces; and the degradation consists in the fragmentary shape in
which the prisoner has to appear in heaven. As a missionary said
to me: "He can't lie out that he got there properly when he
carries with him such damning evidence to the contrary."</p>

<p><b>THE DESCENT TO THE RIVER MEKONG</b></p>
</center>

<p>In China immense power is given to the husband over the body
of his wife, and it seems as if the tendency in England were to
approximate to the Chinese custom. Is it not a fact that, if a
husband in England brutally maltreats his wife, kicks her
senseless, and disfigures her for life, the average English bench
of unpaid magistrates will find extenuating circumstances in the
fact of his being the husband, and will rarely sentence him to
more than a month or two's hard labour?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX. THE MEKONG AND SALWEEN RIVERS.--HOW TO TRAVEL IN
CHINA</h3>

<p>Today, May 7th, we crossed the River Mekong, even at this
distance from Siam a broad and swift stream. The river flows into
the light from a dark and gloomy gorge, takes a sharp bend, and
rolls on between the mountains. Where it issues from the gorge a
suspension bridge has been stretched across the stream. A
wonderful pathway zigzags down the face of the mountain to the
river, in an almost vertical incline of 2000ft. At the riverside
an embankment of dressed stone, built up from the rock, leads for
some hundreds of feet along the bank, where there would otherwise
have been no foothold, to the clearing by the bridge. The
likin-barrier is here, and a tea house or two, and the guardian
temple. The bridge itself is graceful and strong, swinging easily
30ft. above the current; it is built of powerful chains, carried
from bank to bank and held by masses of solid masonry set in the
bed-rock. It is 60 yards long and toft, wide, is floored with
wood, and has a picket parapet supported by lateral chains. From
the river a path led us up to a small village, where my men
rested to gather strength. For facing us were the mountain
heights, which had to be escaladed before we could leave the
river gulch. Then with immense toil we climbed up the mountain
path by a rocky staircase of thousands of steps, till, worn out
and with "Bones" nearly dead, we at length reached the narrow
defile near the summit, whence an easy road brought us in the
early evening to Shuichai (6700ft.).</p>

<p>In the course of one afternoon we had descended 2000ft. to the
river (4250ft. above the sea), and had then climbed 2450ft. to
Shuichai. And the ascent from the river was steeper than the
descent into it; yet the railway which is to be built over this
trade-route between Burma and Yunnan will have other engineering
difficulties to contend with even greater than this.</p>

<p>My soldier to-day was a boy of fifteen or sixteen. He was
armed with a revolver, and bore himself valiantly. But his
revolver was more dangerous in appearance than in effect, for the
cylinder would not revolve, the hammer was broken short off, and
there were no cartridges. Everywhere the weapon was examined with
curiosity blended with awe, and I imagine that the Chinese were
told strange tales of its deadliness.</p>

<p>Next morning we continued by easy gradients to Talichao
(7700ft.), rising 1000ft. in rather less than seven miles. It was
bitterly cold in the mists of the early morning. But twenty miles
further the road dipped again to the sunshine and warmth of the
valley of Yungchang, where, in the city made famous by Marco
Polo, we found comfortable quarters in an excellent inn.</p>

<p>Yungchang is a large town, strongly walled. It is, however,
only a remnant of the old city, acres of houses having been
destroyed during the insurrection, when for three years, it is
said, Imperialists and Mohammedans were contending for its
possession. There is a telegraph station in the town. The streets
are broad and well-paved, the inns large, and the temples
flourishing. One fortunate circumstance the traveller will notice
in Yungchang--there is a marked diminution in the number of cases
of goitre. And the diminution is not confined to the town, but is
apparent from this point right on to Burma.</p>

<p>Long after our arrival in Yungchang my opium-eating coolie
"Bones" had not come, and we had to wait for him in anger and
annoyance. He had my hamper of eatables and my bundle of bedding.
Tired of waiting for him, I went for a walk to the telegraph
office and was turning to come back, when I met the faithful
skeleton, a mile from the inn, walking along as if to a funeral,
his neck elongating from side to side like a camel's, a lean and
hungry look in his staring eyes, his bones crackling inside his
skin. Continuing in the direction that he was going when I found
him, he might have reached Thibet in time, but never Burma. I led
him back to the hotel, where he ruefully showed me his empty
string of cash, as if that had been the cause of his delay; he
had only 6 cash left, and he wanted an advance.</p>

<p>This was the worst coolie I had in my employ during my
journey. But he was a good-natured fellow and honest. He was
better educated, too, than most of the other coolies, and could
both read and write. His dress on march was characteristic of the
man. He was nearly naked; his clothes hardly hung together; he
wore no sandals on his feet; but round his neck he carried a
small earthenware phial of opium ash. In the early stages he
delayed us all an hour or two every day, but he improved as we
went further. And then he was so long and thin, so grotesque in
his gait, and afforded me such frequent amusement, that I would
not willingly have exchanged him for the most active coolie in
China.</p>

<p>On the 9th we had a long and steep march west from the plain
of Yungchang. At Pupiao I had a public lunch. It was market day,
and the country people enjoyed the rare pleasure of seeing a
foreigner feed. The street past the inn was packed in a few
minutes, and the innkeeper had all he could do to attend to the
many customers who wished to take tea at the same time as the
foreigner. I was now used to these demonstrations. I could eat on
with undisturbed equanimity. On such occasions I made it a
practice, when I had finished and was leaving the inn, to turn
round and bow gravely to the crowd, thanking them in a few kindly
words of English, for the reception they had accorded me. At the
same time I took the opportunity of mentioning that they would
contribute to the comfort of future travellers, if only they
would pay a little more attention to their table manners. Then,
addressing the innkeeper, I thought it only right to point out to
him that it was absurd to expect that one small black cloth
should wipe all cups and cup-lids, all tables, all spilt tea, and
all dishes, all through the day, without getting dirty.
Occasionally, too, I pointed out another defect of management to
the inn-keepen and told him that, while I personally had an open
mind on the subject, other travellers might come his way who
would disapprove, for instance--he would pardon my mentioning
it--of the manure coolie passing through the restaurant with his
buckets at mealtime, and halting by the table to see the stranger
eat.</p>

<p>When I spoke in this way quite seriously and bowed, those
whose eyes met mine always bowed gravely in return. And for the
next hour on the track my men would tell each other, with cackles
of laughter, how Mo Shensen, their master, mystified the
natives.</p>

<p><b>INSIDE VIEW OF A SUSPENSION BRIDGE</b></p>
</center>

<p>From Pupiao we had a pleasant ride over a valley-plain,
between hedges of cactus in flower and bushes of red roses, past
graceful clumps of bamboo waving like ostrich feathers. By-and-by
drizzling rain came on and compelled us to seek shelter in the
only inn in a poor out-of-the-way hamlet. But I could not stop
here, because the best room in the inn was already occupied by a
military officer of some distinction, a colonel, on his way, like
ourselves, to Tengyueh. An official chair with arched poles
fitted for four bearers was in the common-room; the mules of his
attendants were in the stables, and were valuable animals. The
landlord offered me another room, an inferior one; but I waved
the open fingers of my left hand before my face and said,
"<i>puyao! puyao!</i>" (I don't want it, I don't want it). For I
was not so foolish or inconsistent as to be content with a poorer
quarter of the inn than that occupied by the officer, whatever
his button. I could not acknowledge to the Chinese that any
Chinaman travelling in the Middle Kingdom was my equal, let alone
my superior. Refusing to remain, I waited in the front room until
the rain should lift and allow us to proceed. But we did not
require to go on. It happened as I expected. The Colonel sent for
me, and, bowing to me, showed by signs that one half his room was
at my service. In return for his politeness he had the privilege
of seeing me eat. With both hands I offered him in turn every one
of my dishes. Afterwards I showed him my photographs--I treated
him, indeed, with proper condescension. On the loth we crossed
the famous River Salween (2600 ft.). Through an open tableland,
well grassed and sparsely wooded, we came at length to the cleft
in the hills from which is obtained the first view of the river
valley. There was a small village here, and, while we were taking
tea, a soldier came hurriedly down the road, who handed me a
letter addressed in Chinese. I confess that at the moment I had a
sudden misgiving that some impediment was to be put in the way of
my journey. But it was nothing more than a telegram from Mr.
Jensen in Yunnan, telling me of the decision of the Chinese
Government to continue the telegraph to the frontier of Burma.
The telegram was written by the Chinese operator in Yungchang in
a neat round hand, without any error of spelling; it had come to
Yungchang after my departure, and had been courteously forwarded
by the Chinese manager. The soldier who brought it had made a
hurried march of thirty-eight miles before overtaking me, and
deserved a reward. I motioned Laotseng, my cash-bearer, to give
him a present, and he meanly counted out 25 cash, and was about
to give them, when I ostentatiously increased the amount to 100
cash. The soldier was delighted; the onlookers were charmed with
this exhibition of Western munificence. Suppose a rich Chinese
traveller in England, who spoke no English, were to offer Tommy
Atkins twopence halfpenny for travelling on foot thirty-eight
miles to bring him a telegram, having then to walk back
thirty-eight miles and find himself on the way, would the English
soldier bow as gratefully as did his perishing Chinese brother
when I thus rewarded him?</p>

<p>We descended by beautiful open country into the Valley of the
Shadow of Death--the valley of the River Salween. No other part
of Western China has the evil repute of this valley; its
unhealthiness is a by-word. "It is impossible to pass," says
Marco Polo; "the air in summer is so impure and bad and any
foreigner attempting it would die for certain."</p>

<p>The Salween was formerly the boundary between Burma and China,
and it is to be regretted that at the annexation of Upper Burma
England did not push her frontier back to its former position.
But the delimitation of the frontier of Burma is not yet
complete. No time could be more opportune for its completion than
the present, when China is distracted, by her difficulties with
Japan. China disheartened could need but little persuasion to
accede to the just demand of England that the frontier of Burma
shall be the true southwestern frontier of China--the Salween
River.</p>

<p>There are no Chinese in the valley, nor would any Chinaman
venture to cross it after nightfall. The reason of its
unhealthiness is not apparent, except in the explanation of
Baber, that "border regions, 'debatable grounds,' are notoriously
the birthplace of myths and marvels." There can be little doubt
that the deadliness of the valley is a tradition rather than a
reality.</p>

<p>By flights of stone steps we descended to the river, where, at
the bridge-landing, we were arrested by a sight that could not be
seen without emotion. A prisoner, chained by the hands and feet
and cooped in a wooden cage, was being carried by four bearers to
Yungchang to execution. He was not more than twenty-one years of
age, was well-dressed, and evidently of a rank in life from which
are recruited few of the criminals of China. Yet his crime could
not have been much graver. On the corner posts of his cage white
strips of paper were posted, giving his name and the particulars
of the crime which he was so soon to expiate. He was a burglar
who had escaped from prison by killing his guard, and had been
recaptured. Unlike other criminals I have seen in China, who
laugh at the stranger and appear unaffected by their lot, this
young fellow seemed to feel keenly the cruel but well-deserved
fate that was in store for him. Three days hence he would be put
to death by strangulation outside the wall of Yungchang,</p>

<p>Another of those remarkable works which declare the
engineering skill of the Chinese, is the suspension bridge which
spans the Salween by a double loop--the larger loop over the
river, the smaller one across the overflow. A natural piece of
rock strengthened by masonry, rising from the river bed, holds
the central ends of both loops. The longer span is 80 yards in
length, the shorter 55; both are 12ft. wide, and are formed of
twelve parallel chain cables, drawn to an appropriate curve. A
rapid river flows under the bridge, the rush of whose waters can
be heard high up the mountain slopes.</p>

<p>None but Shans live in the valley. They are permitted to
govern themselves under Chinese supervision, and preserve their
own laws and customs. They have a village near the bridge, of
grass-thatched huts and open booths, where travellers can find
rest and refreshment, and where native women prettily arrayed in
dark-blue, will brew you tea in earthenware teapots. Very
different are the Shan women from the Chinese. Their colour is
much darker; their head-dress is a circular pile formed of
concentric folds of dark-blue cloth; their dress closely
resembles with its jacket and kilt the bathing dress of
civilisation; their arms are bare, they have gaiters on their
legs, and do not compress their feet. All wear brooches and
earrings, and other ornaments of silver filigree.</p>

<p><b>THE RIVER SAL WEEN</b></p>
</center>

<p>From the valley the main road rises without intermission 6130
feet to the village of Fengshui-ling (8730 feet), a climb which
has to be completed in the course of the afternoon. We were once
more among the trees. Pushing on till I was afraid we should be
benighted, we reached long after dark an encampment of bamboo and
grass, in the lonely bush, where the kind people made us welcome.
It was bitterly cold during the night, for the hut I slept in was
open to the air. My three men and the escort must have been even
colder than I was but at least we all slept in perfect security,
and I cannot praise too highly the constant care of the Chinese
authorities to shield even from the apprehension of harm, one
whose only protection was his British passport.</p>

<p>All the way westward from Yunnan City I was shadowed both by a
yamen-runner and a soldier; both were changed nearly every day,
and the further west I went the more frequently were they armed.
The yamen-runner usually carried a long native sword only, but
the soldier, in addition to his sword, was on one occasion, as we
have seen, armed with the relics of a revolver that would not
revolve. On May 10th, for the first time, the soldier detailed to
accompany me was provided with a rusty old musket with a very
long barrel. I examined this weapon with much curiosity. China is
our neighbour in Eastern Asia, and is, it is often stated, an
ideal power to be intrusted with the government of the buffer
state called for by French aggression in Siam. In China, it is
alleged, we have a prospective ally in Asia, and it is preferable
that England should suffer all reasonable indignities and
humilities at her hands rather than endanger any possible
relations, which may subsequently be entered into, with a
hypothetically powerful neighbour.</p>

<p>On my arrival in Burma I was often amused by the serious
questions I was asked concerning the military equipment of the
Chinese soldiers of Western Yunnan. The soldier who was with me
to-day was a type of the warlike sons of China, not only in the
province bordering on Burma, but, with slight differences, all
over the Middle Kingdom. Now, physically, this man was fit to be
drafted into any army in the world, but, apart from his
endurance, his value as a fighting machine lay in the weapon with
which the military authorities had armed him. This weapon was
peculiar; I noted down its peculiarities on the spot. In this
weapon the spring of the trigger was broken so that it could not
be pulled; if it had been in order, there was no cap for the
hammer to strike; if there had been a cap, it would have been of
no use because the pinhole was rusted; even if the pinhole had
been open, the rifle would still have been ineffective because it
was not loaded, for the very good reason that the soldier had not
been provided with powder, or, if he had, he had been compelled
to sell it in order to purchase the rice which the Emperor,
"whose rice he ate," had neglected to send him.</p>

<p>An early start in the morning and we descended quickly to the
River Shweli.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="0500681h-28a"></a><img alt="" src=
"0500681h-images/0500681h-28a.jpg"></p>

<p><b>THE RIVER SHWELI AND ITS SUSPENSION BRIDGE</b></p>
</center>

<p>The Salween River is at an elevation of 2600 feet. Forty-five
li further the road reaches at Fengshui-ling a height of 8730,
from which point, in thirty-five li, it dips again to the River
Shweli, 4400 feet above sea level. There was the usual suspension
bridge at the river, and the inevitable likin-barrier. For the
first time the Customs officials seemed inclined to delay me. I
was on foot, and separated from my men by half the height of the
hill. The collectors, and the underlings who are always hanging
about the barriers, gathered round me and interrogated me
closely. They spoke to me in Chinese, and with insufficient
deference. The Chinese seem imbued with the mistaken belief that
their language is the vehicle of intercourse not only within the
four seas, but beyond them, and are often arrogant in
consequence. I answered them in English. "I don't understand one
word you say, but, if you wish to know," I said, energetically,
"I come from Shanghai."</p>

<p>"Shanghai," they exclaimed, "he comes from Shanghai!" "And I
am bound for Singai" (Bhamo) ;--"Singai," they repeated, "he is
going to Singai!"--"unless the Imperial Government, suspicious of
my intentions, which the meanest Intelligence can see are
pacific, should prevent me, in which case England will find a
coveted pretext to add Yunnan to her Burmese Empire." Then,
addressing myself to the noisiest, I indulged in some sarcastic
speculations upon his probable family history, deduced from his
personal peculiarities, till he looked very uncomfortable indeed.
Thereupon I gravely bowed to them, and, leaving them in dumb
astonishment, walked on over the bridge. They probably thought I
was rating them in Manchu, the language of the Emperor. Two boys
staggering under loads of firewood did not escape so easily, but
were detained and a log squeezed from each wherewith to light the
likin fires.</p>

<p>A steep climb of another 3000 or 4000 feet over hills carpeted
with bracken, with here and there grassy swards, pretty with
lilies and daisies and wild strawberries, and then a quick
descent, and we were in the valley of Tengyueh (5600ft.). A plain
everywhere irrigated, flanked by treeless hills; fields shut in
by low embankments; villages in plantations round its margin;
black-faced sheep in flocks on the hillsides; and, away to the
right the crenellated walls of Tengyueh. A stone-flagged path
down the centre of the plain led us into the town. We entered by
the south gate, and, turning to the left, were conducted into the
telegraph compound, where I was to find accommodation, the clerk
in charge of the operators being able to speak a few words of
English I was an immediate object of curiosity.</p>

<p><a name="ch-20"></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX. THE CITY OF TEN GYUEH--THE CELEBRATED WUNTHO
SAWBWA--SHAN SOLDIERS.</h3>

<p>I was given a comfortable room in the telegraph offices, but I
had little privacy. My room was thronged during all the time of
my visit. The first evening I held an informal and involuntary
reception, which was attended by all the officials of the town,
with the dignified exception of the Brigadier-General. The three
members of the Chinese Boundary Commission, which had recently
arranged with the British Commission the preliminaries to the
delimitation of the boundary between Burma and China, were here,
disputing with clerks, yamen-runners, and chair-coolies for a
sight of my photographs and curiosities. The telegraph Manager
Pen, Yeh (the magistrate), and a stalwart soldier (Colonel Liu),
formed the Commission, and they retain hallowed recollections of
the benignity of the Englishmen, and the excellence of their
champagne. Colonel Liu proved to be the most enlightened member
of the party. He is a tall, handsome fellow, fifty years of age,
a native of Hunan, the most warlike and anti-foreign province in
China. He was especially glad to see a foreign doctor. The
gallant Colonel confided to me a wish that had long been
uppermost in his heart. From some member, unknown, of the British
Commission he had learnt of the marvellous rejuvenating power of
a barbarian medicine--could I get him some? Could I get him a
bottle of hair-dye? Unlike his compatriots, who regard the
external features of longevity as the most coveted attribute of
life, this gentleman, in whose brain the light of civilisation
was dawning, wished to frustrate the doings of age. Could I get
him a bottle of hair-dye? He was in charge of the fort at Ganai,
two days out on the way to Bhamo, and would write to the officer
in charge during his absence directing him to provide me with an
escort worthy of my benefaction.</p>

<p>One celebrity, who lives in the neighbourhood of Tengyueh, did
not favour me with a visit. That famous dacoit, the outlawed
Prince of Wuntho--the Wuntho Sawbwa--lives here, an exile
sheltered by the Chinese Government. A pure Burmese himself, the
father-in-law of the amiable Sawbwa of Santa, he is believed by
the Government of Burma to have been "concerned in all the Kachin
risings of 1892-1893." A reward of 5000 rupees is offered for his
head, which will be paid equally whether the head be on or off
the shoulders. Another famous outlaw, the Shan Chief Kanh-liang,
is also believed to be in hiding in the neighbourhood of
Tengyueh. The value of his head has been assessed at 2000
rupees.</p>

<p>Tengyueh is more a park than a town. The greater part of the
city within the walls is waste land or gardens. The houses are
collected mainly near the south gate, and extend beyond the south
gate on each side of the road for half a mile on the road to
Bhamo. There is an excellent wall in admirable order, with an
embankment of earth 20ft. in width. But I saw no guns of any kind
whatever, nor did I meet a single armed man in the town or
district.</p>

<p>Tengyueh is so situated that the invading army coming from
Burma will find a pleasant pastime in shelling it from the open
hills all around the town. This was the last stronghold of the
Mohammedans. It was formerly a prosperous border town, the chief
town in all the fertile valley of the Taiping. It was in the
hands of the rebels till June loth, 1873, when it was delivered
over to the Imperialists to carnage and destruction. The valley
is fertile and well populated, and prosperity is quickly
returning to the district.</p>

<p>There is only one yamen in Tengyueh of any pretension, and it
is the official residence of a red-button warrior, the
Brigadier-General (Chentai) Chang, the successor, though not, of
course, the immediate successor, of Li-Sieh-tai, who was
concerned in the murder of Margary and the repulse of the
expedition under Colonel Horace Browne in 1875. A tall, handsome
Chinaman is Chang, of soldierly bearing and blissful innocence of
all knowledge of modern warfare. Yung-chang is the limit of his
jurisdiction in one direction, the Burmese boundary in the other;
his only superior officer is the Titai in Tali.</p>

<p>The telegraph office adjoins the City Temple and Theatre of
Tengyueh. At this time the annual festival was being celebrated
in the temple. Theatrical performances were being given in
uninterrupted succession daily for the term of one month. Play
began at sunrise, and the curtain fell, or would have fallen if
there had been a curtain, at twilight. Day was rendered hideous
by the clangour of the instruments which the blunted senses of
Chinese have been misguided into believing are musical. Already
the play, or succession of plays, had continued fifteen days, and
other thirteen days had yet to be endured before its completion.
Crowds occupied the temple court during the performance, while a
considerable body of dead-heads witnessed the entertainment from
the embankment and wall overlooking the open stage. My host, the
telegraph Manager Pen, and his two friends Liu and Yeh, were
given an improvised seat of honour outside my window, and here
they sat all day and sipped tea and cracked jokes. No actresses
were on the stage; the female parts were taken by men whose
make-up was admirable, and who imitated, with curious fidelity,
the voice and gestures of women. The dresses were rich and
varied. Scene-shifters, band, supers, and friends remained on the
stage during the performance, dodging about among the actors.
There is no drop curtain in a Chinese theatre, and all scenes are
changed on the open stage before you. The villain, whose nose is
painted white, vanquished by triumphant virtue, dies a gory
death; he remains dead just long enough to satisfy you that he is
dead, and then gets up and serenely walks to the side. There is
laughter at sallies of indecency, and the spectators grunt their
applause. The Chinaman is rarely carried away by his feelings at
the theatre; indeed, it may be questioned if strong emotion is
ever aroused in his breast, except by the first addresses of the
junior members of the China Inland Mission, the thrilling effect
of whose Chinese exhortations is recorded every month in China's
Millions.</p>

<p>The Manager of the telegraph, to show his good feeling,
presented me with a stale tin of condensed milk. His second clerk
and operator was the most covetous man I met in China. He begged
in turn for nearly every article I possessed, beginning with my
waterproof, which I did not give him, and ending with the empty
milk tin, which I did, for "Give to him that asketh," said
Buddha, "even though it be but a little." The chief operator in
charge of the telegraph offices speaks a little English, and is
the medium by which English messages and letters are translated
into Chinese for the information of the officials. His name is
Chueh. His method of translation is to glean the sense of a
sentence by the probable meaning, derived from an inaccurate
Anglo-Chinese dictionary, of the separate words of the sentence.
He is a broken reed to trust to as an interpreter. Chueh is not
an offensively truthful man. When he speaks to you, you find
yourself wondering if you have ever met a greater liar than he.
"Three men's strength," he says, "cannot prevail against truth;"
yet he is, I think, the greatest liar I have met since I left
Morocco. Indeed, the way he spoke of my head boy Laotseng, who
was undoubtedly an honest Chinese, and the opinion Laotseng
emphatically held of Chueh, was a curious repetition of an
experience that I had not long ago in Morocco. I was living in
Tangier, when I had occasion to go to Fez and Mequinez. My visit
was arranged so hurriedly that I had no means of learning what
was the degree of personal esteem attaching to the gentleman, a
resident of Tangier, who was to be my companion. I accordingly
interrogated the hotel-keeper, Mr. B. "What kind of a man is D.?"
I asked. "Not a bad fellow," he replied, "if he wasn't such a
blank, blank awful liar!" On the road to Wazan I became very
friendly with D., and one day questioned him as to his private
regard for Mr. B. of the hotel. "A fine fellow B. seems," I said,
"very friendly and entertaining. What do you think of him?" "What
do I think of him?" he shouted in his falsetto. "I know he's the
biggest blank liar in Morocco." It was pleasant to meet, even in
Morocco, such a rare case of mutual esteem.</p>

<p>My pony fared badly in Tengyueh. There was a poor stable in
the courtyard with a tiled roof that would fall at the first
shower. There were no beans. The pony had to be content with rice
or paddy, which it disliked equally. The rice was 1.5<i>d</i>.
the 7.5 lbs. There was no grass, Chueh said, to be obtained in
the district. He assured me so on his honour, or its Chinese
equivalent; but I sent out and bought some in the street round
the corner.</p>

<p>Silver in Tengyueh is the purest Szechuen or Yunnanese silver.
Rupees are also current, and at this time were equivalent to 400
cash--the tael at the same time being worth 1260 cash. Every 10
taels, costing me 30<i>s</i>. in Shanghai, I could exchange in
Tengyueh for 31 rupees. Rupees are the chief silver currency west
from Tengyueh into Burma.</p>

<p>On May 31st I had given instructions that we were to leave
early, but my men, who did not sleep in the telegraph compound,
were late in coming. To still further delay me, at the time of
leaving no escort had made its appearance. I did not wait for it.
We marched out of the town unaccompanied, and were among the
tombstones on the rise overlooking the town when the escort
hurriedly overtook us. It consisted of a quiet-mannered chairen
and two soldiers, one of whom was an impudent cub that I had to
treat with every indignity. He was armed with a sword carried in
the folds of his red cincture, in which was also concealed an old
muzzle-loading pistol, formidable to look at but unloaded. This
was one of the days on my journey when I wished that I had
brought a revolver, not as a defence case of danger, for there
was no danger, but as a menace on occasion of anger.</p>

<p>Rain fell continuously. At a small village thronged with
muleteers from Bhamo we took shelter for an hour. The men sipping
tea under the verandahs had seen Europeans in Bhamo, and my
presence evoked no interest whatever. Many of these strangers
possessed an astonishing likeness to European friends of my own.
Contact with Europeans causing the phenomena of "maternal
impression," was probably in a few cases accountable for the
moulding of their features, but the general prevalence of the
European type has yet to be explained. "My conscience! Who could
ever have expected to meet you here?" I was often on the point of
saying to some Chinese Shan or Burmese Shan in whom, to my
confusion, I thought I recognised a college friend of my own.</p>

<p>Leaving the village, we followed the windings of the River
Taiping, coasting along the edge of the high land on the left
bank of the river.</p>

<p><b>THE SUBURB BEYOND THE SOUTH GATE OF TENGYUEH</b></p>
</center>

<p>Rain poured incessantly; the creeks overflowed; the paths
became watercourses and were scarcely fordable. "Bones," my
opium-eating coolie with the long neck, slipped into a hole which
was too deep even for his long shanks, and all my bedding was
wetted. It was ninety li to Nantien, the fort we were bound to
beyond Tengyueh, and we finished the distance by sundown. The
town is of little importance. It is situated on an eminence and
is surrounded by a wall built, with that strange spirit of
contrariness characteristic of the Chinese, and because it
incloses a fort, more weakly than any city wall. It is not more
substantial nor higher than the wall round many a mission
compound. Some 400 soldiers are stationed in the fort, which
means that the commander draws the pay for 1000 soldiers, and
represents the strength of his garrison as 1000. Their arms are
primitive and rusty muzzle-loaders of many patterns; there are no
guns to be seen, if there are any in existence--which is
doubtful. The few rusty cast-iron ten-pounders that lie hors de
combat in the mud have long since become useless. There may be
ammunition in the fort; but there is none to be seen. It is more
probable, and more in accordance with Chinese practice in such
matters, that the ammunition left by his predecessor (if any were
left, which is doubtful) has long ago been sold by the colonel in
command, whose perquisite this would naturally be.</p>

<p>The fort of Nantien is a fort in name only--it has no need to
be otherwise, for peace and quiet are abroad in the valley.
Besides, the mere fact of its being called a fort is sufficiently
misleading to the neighbouring British province of Burma, where
they are apt to picture a Chinese fort as a structure seriously
built in some accordance with modern methods of
fortification.</p>

<p>I was given a comfortable room in a large inn already well
filled with travellers. All treated me with pleasant courtesy.
They were at supper when I entered the room, and they invited me
to share their food. They gave me the best table to myself, and
after supper they crowded into another room in order to let me
have the room to myself.</p>

<p>Next day we continued along the sandy bed of the river, which
was here more than a mile in width. The river itself, shrunk now
into its smallest size, flowed in a double stream down the
middle. Then we left the river, and rode along the high bank
flanking the valley. All paved roads had ended at Tengyueh, and
the track was deeply cut and jagged by the rains. At one point in
to-day's journey the road led up an almost vertical ascent to a
narrow ledge or spur at the summit, and then fell as steeply into
the plain again. It was a shortcut, that, as you would expect in
China, required five times more physical effort to compass than
did the longer but level road which it was intended to save. So
narrow is the ridge that the double row of open sheds leaves
barely room for pack mules to pass. The whole traffic on the
caravan route to Burma passes by this spot. The long bamboo sheds
with their grass roofs are divided into stalls, where Shan women
in their fantastic turbans, with silver bracelets and earrings,
their lips and teeth stained with betel-juice, sit behind the
counters of raised earth, and eagerly compete for the custom of
travellers. More than half the women had goitre. Before them were
laid out the various dishes. There were pale cuts of pork, well
soaked in water to double their weight, eggs and cabbage and
salted fish, bean curds, and a doubtful tea flavoured with
camomile and wild herbs. There were hampers of coarse grass for
the horses, and wooden bowls of cooked rice for the men, while
hollow bamboos were used equally to bring water from below, to
hold sheaves of chopsticks where the traveller helped himself,
and to receive the cash. Trade was busy. Muleteers are glad to
rest here after the climb, if only to enjoy a puff of tobacco
from the bamboo-pipe which is always carried by one member of the
party for the common use of all.</p>

<p>Descending again into the river valley, I rode lazily along in
the sun, taking no heed of my men, who were soon separated from
me. The broad river-bed of sand was before me as level as the
waters of a lake. As I was riding slowly along by myself, away
from all guard, I saw approaching me in the lonely plain a small
body of men. They were moving quickly along in single file, and
we soon met and passed each other. They were three Chinese Shan
officers on horseback, dressed in Chinese fashion, and
immediately behind them were six soldiers on foot, who I saw were
Burmese or Burmese Shans. They were smart men, clad in loose
jerseys and knickerbockers, with sun-hats and bare legs, and they
marched like soldiers. Cartridge-belts were over their left
shoulders, and Martini-Henry rifles, carried muzzle foremost, on
their right. I took particular note of them because they were
stepping in admirable order, and, though small of stature, I
thought they were the first armed men I had met in all my journey
across China who could without shame be presented as soldiers in
any civilised country.</p>

<p>They passed me, but seemed struck by my appearance; and I had
not gone a dozen yards before they all stopped by a common
impulse, and when I looked back they were still there in a group
talking, with the officers' horses turned towards me; and it was
very evident I was the subject of their conversation. I was alone
at the time, far from all my men, without weapon of any kind. I
was dressed in full Chinese dress and mounted on an unmistakably
Chinese pony. I rode unconcernedly on, but I must confess that I
did not feel comfortable till I was assured that they did not
intend to obtrude an interview upon me. At length, to my relief,
the party continued on its way, while I hurried on to my coolies,
and made them wait till my party was complete. I was probably
alarmed without any reason. But it was not till I arrived in
Burma that I learnt that this was the armed escort of the
outlawed Wuntho Sawbwa, the dacoit chief who has a price set on
his head. The soldiers' rifles and cartridge-belts had been
stripped from the dead bodies of British sepoys, killed on the
frontier in the Kachin Hills.</p>

<p>My men, when we were all together again, indicated to me by
signs that I would shortly meet an elephant, and I thought that
at last I was about to witness the realisation of that story,
everywhere current in Western China, of the British tribute from
Burma. Sure enough we had not gone far when, at the foot of a
headland which projected into the plain, we came full upon a
large elephant picking its way along the margin of the rocks--a
remarkable sight to my Chinese. Its scarlet howdah was empty; its
trappings were scarlet; the mahout was a Shan. It was the
elephant of the Wuntho Prince--a little earlier and I might have
had the privilege of meeting the dacoit himself. The elephant
passed unconcernedly on, and we continued down the plain of sand
to the village of Ganai, where we were to stay the night.</p>

<p>It was market-day in the town. A double row of stalls extended
down the main street, each stall under the shelter of a huge
umbrella. Japanese matches from Osaka were for sale here, and
foreign nick-nacks, needles and braid and cotton, and Manchester
dress stuffs mixed with the multitudinous articles of native
produce. This is a Shan town, but large numbers of native
women--Kachins--were here also with their ugly black faces, and
coarse black fringes hiding their low foreheads. Far away from
the town an obliging Shan had attached himself to us as guide. He
was dressed in white cotton jacket and dark-blue knickerbockers,
with a dark-blue sash round his waist. He was barelegged, and
rode as the Chinese do, and as you would expect them to do who do
everything al reves, with the heel in the stirrup instead of the
toe. His turban was dark-blue, and the pigtail was coiled up
under it, and did not hang down from under the skull cap as with
the Chinese. When I rode into the town accompanied by the guide,
all the people forsook the market street and followed the
illustrious stranger to the inn which had been selected for his
resting-place. It was a favourite inn, and was already crowded.
The best room was in possession of Chinese travellers, who were
on the road like myself. They were dozing on the couches, but
what must they do when I entered the room but, thinking that I
should wish to occupy it by myself, rise and pack up their
things, and one after another move into another apartment
adjoining, which was already well filled, and now became doubly
so. Their thoughtfulness and courtesy charmed me. They must have
been more tired than I was, but they smiled and nodded pleasantly
to me as they left the room, as if they were grateful to me for
putting them to inconvenience. They may be perishing heathen, I
thought, but the average deacon or elder in our enlightened
country could scarcely be more courteous.</p>

<p>Ganai is a mud village thatched with grass. It is a military
station under the command of the red-button Colonel Liu, whom I
met in Tengyueh. The Colonel had earned his bottle of hair-dye.
He had written to have me provided with an escort, and by-and-by
the two officers who were to accompany me on the morrow came in
to see me. As many spectators as could find elbow-room squeezed
into my room behind them. Both were gentlemanly young fellows,
very amiable and inquisitive, and keenly desirous to learn all
they could concerning my honourable family. Their curiosity was
satisfied. By the help of my Chinese phrasebook I gave them all
particulars, and a few more. You see it was important that I
should leave as favourable an impression as possible for the
benefit of future travellers. More than one of my ancestors I
brought to life again and endowed a patriarchal age and a beard
to correspond. As to my own age they marvelled greatly that one
so young-looking could be so old, and when, in answer to their
earnest question, I modestly confessed that I was already the
unhappy possessor of two unworthy wives, five wretched sons, and
three contemptible daughters, their admiration of my virtue
increased tenfold.</p>

<p>The officers left me after this, but till late at night I held
<i>levees</i> of the townsfolk, our landlady, who was most
zealous, no sooner dismissing one crowd than another pressed into
its place. The courtyard, I believe, remained filled till early
in the morning, but I was allowed to sleep at last.</p>

<p>A large crowd followed me out of the town in the morning, and
swarmed with me across the beautiful sward, as level as the Oval,
which here widens into the country. No guest was ever sped on his
way with a kindlier farewell. The fort is outside the town; we
passed it on our left; it is a square inclosure of considerable
size, inclosed by a mud wall 15 feet high; it is in the
unsheltered plain, and presents no formidable front to an
invader. At each of the four corners outside the square are
detached four-sided watch-towers. No guns of any kind are mounted
on the walls, and there are no sentries; one could easily imagine
that the inclosure was a market-square, but imagination could
never picture it as a serious obstacle to an armed entry into
Western China. The river was well on our right. The plain down
which we rode is of exceeding richness and highly cultivated,
water being trained into the paddy-fields in the same way that
everywhere prevails in China proper. Buffaloes were
ploughing--wearily plodding through mud and water up to their
middles. We were now among the Shans, and those working in the
fields were Shans, not Chinese. Ganai, Santa, and other places
are but little principalities or Shan States, governed by
hereditary princelets or Sawbwas, and preserving a form of
self-government under the protection of the Chinese. There are no
more charming people in the world than the Shans. They are
courteous, hospitable, and honest, with all the virtues and few
of the vices of Orientals. "The elder brothers of the Siamese,
they came originally from the Chinese province of Szechuen, and
they can boast of a civilisation dating from twenty-three
centuries B.C." So Terrien de Lacouperie tells us, who had a
happy faculty of drawing upon his imagination for his facts.</p>

<p>Under the wide branches of a banyan tree I made my men stop,
for I was very tired, and while they waited I lay down for an
hour on the grass and had a refreshing sleep. While I slept, the
rest of the escort sent to "sung" me to Santa arrived. Within a
few yards of my resting place there is a characteristic monument,
dating from the time when Burma occupied not only this valley but
the fertile territory beyond it, and beyond Tengyueh to the River
Salween. It is a solid Burmese pagoda, built of concentric layers
of brick and mortar, and surmounted with a solid bell-shaped dome
that is still intact. It stands alone on the plain near a group
of banyans, and its erection no doubt gained many myriads of
merits for the conscience-stricken Buddhist who found the money
to build it. All goldleaf has been peeled off the Pagoda years
ago.</p>

<p>It was a picturesque party that now enfiladed into the wide
stretch of sand which in the rainy season forms the bed of the
fiver. Mounted on his white pony, there was the inarticulate
European who had discarded his Chinese garb and was now dressed
in the aesthetic garments of the Australian bush; there were his
two coolies and Laotseng his boy, none of whom could speak any
English, the two officers in their loose Chinese clothes, mounted
on tough little ponies, and eight soldiers. They were Shans of
kindly feature, small and nimble fellows, in neat uniforms--green
jackets edged with black and braided with yellow, yellow sashes,
and loose dark-blue knickerbockers--the uniform of the Sawbwa of
Ganai. They were armed with Remington rifles, carried their
cartridges in bandoliers, and seemed to be of excellent fighting
material. All their accoutrements were in good order.</p>

<p>Now we had to cross the broad stream, here running with a
swift current over the sand, in channels of varying depths that
are frequently changing. For the width of nearly half a mile at
the crossing place the water was never shallower than to my knee,
nor deeper than to my waist. We all crossed safely, but, to my
tribulation, the soldier who was carrying my two boxes tripped in
the deepest channel and let both boxes slip from the carrying
pole into the water. All the notes and papers upon which this
valuable record is founded were much damaged. But it might have
been worse. I had a presentiment that an accident would happen,
and had waded back to the channel and was standing by at the
time. But for this the papers might have been floated down to the
Irrawaddy and been lost to the world--loss irreparable!</p>

<p>The sun was very hot. I laid out my things on the bank and
dried them. Long and narrow dugouts, as light and swift as the
string-test gigs of civilisation, paddled or poled, were gliding
with extraordinary speed down the channel near the bank. Riding
then a little way, we dismounted under a magnificent banyan tree,
one of the finest specimens, I should think, in the world. Ponies
and men were dwarfed into Liliputians under the amazing canopy of
its branches. A number of villagers, come to see the foreigner,
were clambering like monkeys over its roots, which "writhed in
fantastic coils" over half an acre. Their village was hard by, a
poor array of mud houses; the teak temple to which we were
conducted was raised on piles in the centre of the village. The
temple was lumbered like an old curiosity shop with fragmentary
gods and torn missals. Yet the ragged priest in his smirched
yellow gown, and shaven head that had been a week unshaven,
seemed to enjoy a reputation for no common sanctity, to judge by
the reverence shown him by my followers, and the contemptuous
indifference with which he regarded their obeisance. He was
club-footed and could only hobble about with difficulty--an
excuse he would, no doubt, urge for the disorder of his
sanctuary. To me, of course, he was very polite, and gave me the
best seat he had, while Laotseng prepared me a bowl of cocoa.
Then we rode along the right bank of the river, but kept moving
away from the stream till in the distance across the plain at the
foot of the hills, we saw the Shan town of Santa, the end of our
day's stage.</p>

<p>Native women, returning from the town, were wending their way
across the plain--lank overgrown girls with long thin legs and
overhanging mops of hair like deck-swabs. They were a favourite
butt of my men, who chaffed them in the humorous Eastern manner,
with remarks that were, I am afraid, more coarse than witty.
Kachins are not virtuous. Their customs preclude such a
possibility. No Japanese maiden is more innocent of virtue than a
Kachin girl.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI. THE SHAN TOWN OF SANTA, AND MANYUEN, THE SCENE
OF CONSUL MARGARY'S MURDER.</h3>

<p>It was market day in Santa, and the accustomed crowd gathered
round me as I stood in the open square in front of the Sawbwa's
yamen. I was hot and hungry, for it was still early in the
afternoon, and the attentions of the people were oppressive.
Presently two men pushed their way through the spectators, and
politely motioning to me to follow them, they led me to a
neighbouring temple, to the upper storey, where the side pavilion
off the chief hall was being prepared for my reception. My
quarters overlooked the main court; the pony was comfortably
stabled in the corner below me. Nothing could have been
pleasanter than the attention I received here. Two foreign chairs
were brought for my use, and half a dozen dishes of good food and
clean chopsticks were set before me. The chief priest welcomed
me, whose smiling face was good-nature itself. With clean-shaven
head and a long robe of grey, with a rosary of black and white
beads hung loosely from his neck, the kind old man moved about my
room giving orders for my comfort. He held authority over a
number of priests, some in black, others in yellow, and over a
small band of choristers. Religion was an active performance in
the temple, and the temple was in good order, with clean matting
and well-kept shrines, with strange pictures on the of elephants
and horses, with legends and scrolls in Burmese as well as in
Chinese.</p>

<p>Towards evening the Santa Sawbwa, the hereditary prince (what
a privilege it was to meet a prince! I had never met even a lord
before in my life, or anyone approaching the rank of a lord,
except a spurious Duke of York whom I sent to the lunatic
asylum), the Prince of Santa paid me a State call, accompanied by
a well-ordered retinue, very different indeed from the ragged
reprobates who follow at the heels of a Chinese grandee when on a
visit of ceremony. The Sawbwa occupied one chair, his
distinguished guest the other, till the chief priest came in,
when, with that deep reverence for the cloth which has always
characterised me, I rose and gave him mine. He refused to take
it, but I insisted; he pretended to be as reluctant to occupy it
as any Frenchman, but I pushed him bodily into it, and that ended
the matter.</p>

<p>A pleasant, kindly fellow is the Prince; even among the Shans
he is conspicuous for his courtesy and amiability. He was a great
favourite with the English Boundary Commission, and in his turn
remembers with much pleasure his association with them. Half a
dozen times, when conversation flagged, he raised his clasped
hands and said "Warry Ching, ching!" and I knew that this was his
foolish heathen way of sending greeting to the Chinese adviser of
the Government of Burma. The Shan dialect is quite distinct from
the Chinese, but all the princes or princelets dress in Chinese
fashion and learn Mandarin, and it was of course in Mandarin that
the Santa Sawbwa conversed with Mr. Warry. This Sawbwa is the
son-in-law of the ex-Wuntho Sawbwa. He rules over a territory
smaller than many squatters' stations in Victoria.</p>

<p>He is one of the ablest of Shans, and would willingly place
his little principality under the protection of England. He is
thirty-five years of age, dresses in full Chinese costume, with
pigtail and skullcap, is pock-marked, and has incipient goitre.
He is polite and refined, chews betel nut "to stimulate his
meditative faculties," and expectorates on the floor with easy
freedom. I showed him my photographs, and he graciously invited
me to give him some. I nodded cheerfully to him in assent, rolled
them all up again, and put them back in my box. He knew that I
did not understand.</p>

<p>We had tea together, and then he took his leave, "Warry
<i>Ching, ching</i>!" being his parting words.</p>

<p>As soon as he had gone the deep drum--a hollow instrument of
wood shaped like a fish--was beaten, and the priests gathered to
vespers, dressed in many-coloured garments of silk; and, as
evening fell, they intoned a sweet and mournful chant.</p>

<p>The service over, all but the choristers entered the room off
the gallery in which I was lying, where, looking in, I saw them
throw off their gowns and coil themselves on the sleeping
benches. Opium-lamps were already lit, and all were soon inhaling
opium; all but one who had rheumatism, and who, lying down,
stretched himself at full length, while a brother priest punched
him all over in that primitive method of massage employed by
every native race the wide world over.</p>

<p>In the City Temple some festival was being celebrated, and
night was turbulent with the beating of gongs and drums and the
bursting of crackers. Long processions of priests in their yellow
robes were passing the temple in the bright moonlight. Priests
were as plentiful as blackberries; if they had been dressed in
black instead of yellow, the traveller might have imagined that
he was in Edinburgh at Assembly time.</p>

<p>In the morning another escort of half a dozen men was ready to
accompany me for the day's stage to Manyuen. They were in the
uniform of the Santa Sawbwa, in blue jackets instead of green.
They were armed with rusty muzzle-loaders, unloaded, and with
long Burmese swords (<i>dahs</i>). They were the most amiable of
warriors, both in feature and manner, and were unlike the
turbaned braves of China, who, armed no better than these men,
still regard, as did their forefathers, fierceness of aspect as
an important factor in warfare (<i>rostro feroz ao
enemigo!</i>)--an illusion also shared in the English army, where
monstrous bearskin shakos were introduced to increase the
apparent height of the soldiers. The officer in command was late
in overtaking me. As soon as he came within horse-length he let
down his queue and bowed reverently, and I could see pride
lighting his features as he confessed to the honour that had been
done him in intrusting such an honourable and illustrious charge
to the mean and unworthy care of so contemptible an officer.</p>

<p>The country before us was open meadow-land, pleasant to ride
over, only here and there broken by a massive banyan tree. Herds
of buffaloes were grazing on the hillsides. The mud villages were
far apart on the margin of the river-plain, inclosed with superb
hedges of living bamboo.</p>

<p>Thirty li from Santa is the Shan village of Taipingkai. It was
market-day, and the broad main street was crowded. We were taken
to the house of an oil-merchant, who kindly asked me in and had
tea brewed for me. Earthen-Ware jars of oil were stacked round
the room. The basement opened to the street, and was packed in a
moment. "<i>Dzo! Dzo!</i>" (Go! go!) cried the master, and the
throng hustled out, to be renewed in a minute by a fresh body of
curious who had waited their turn.</p>

<p>Then we rode on, over a country as beautiful as a nobleman's
park, to the town of Manyuen. Every here and there by the
roadside there are springs of fresh water, where travellers can
slake their thirst. Bamboo ladles are placed here by devotees,
whose action will be counted unto them for righteousness, for "he
that piously bestows a little water shall receive an ocean in
return." And, where there are no springs, neat little bamboo
stalls with shelves are built, and in the cool shelter pitchers
of water and bamboo cups are placed, so that the thirsty may
bless the unknown hand which gives him to drink.</p>

<p>Manyuen--or, to use the name by which it is better known to
foreigners, Manwyne--is a large and straggling town overlooking
the river-plain. It was here that Margary, the British Consular
Agent, was murdered in 1875. I had a long wait at the yamen gate
while they were arranging where to send me, but by-and-by two
yamen-runners came and conducted me to the City Temple. It was
the same temple that Margary had occupied. Many shaven-pated
Buddhist priests were waiting for me, and received me kindly in
the temple hall. A table was brought for me and the only foreign
chair, and Laotseng was shown where to spread my bedding in the
temple hall itself. And here I held levees of the townspeople of
all shades of colour and variety of feature--Chinese, Shan,
Burmese, Kachin, and hybrid. The people were very amiable, and I
found on all sides the same courtesy and kindliness that Margary
describes on his first visit. But the crowd was quiet for only a
little while; then a dispute arose. It began in the far corner,
and the crowd left me to gather round the disputants. Voices were
raised, loud and excited, and increased in energy. A deadly
interest seemed to enthral the bystanders. It was easy to imagine
that they were debating to do with me as they had done with
Margary. The dispute waxed warmer. Surely they will come to
blows? When suddenly the quarrel ceased as it had begun, and the
crowd came smiling back to me. What was the dispute? The priests
were cheapening a chicken for my dinner.</p>

<p>The temple was built on teak piles, and teak pillars supported
the triple roof. It was like a barn or lumber room but for the
gilt Buddhas on the altar and the gilt cabinets by its side,
containing many smaller gilt images of Buddha and his disciples.
Umbrellas, flags, and the tawdry paraphernalia used in
processions were hanging from the beams. Sacerdotal vestments of
dingy yellow--the yellow of turmeric--were tumbled over bamboo
rests. When the gong sounded for prayers, men you thought were
coolies threw these garments over the left shoulder, hitched them
round the waist, and were transformed into priests, putting them
back again immediately after the service. Close under the tiles
was a paper sedan-chair, to be sent for the use of some rich man
in heaven. Painted scrolls of paper were on the walls, and on old
ledges were torn books in the Burmese character, which a few boys
made a pretence of reading. Where I slept the floor was raised
some feet from the ground, and underneath, seen through the
gaping boards--though previously detected by another of the
senses--were a number of coffins freighted with dead, waiting for
a fit occasion for interment. Heavy stones were placed on the
lids to keep the dead more .securely at rest. The lucky day for
burial would be determined by the priests--it would be determined
by them as soon as the pious relatives had paid sufficiently for
their fears. So long, then, as the coffins remained where they
were, they might be described as capital invested by the priests
and returning heavy interest; removed from the temple, they
ceased to be productive.</p>

<p>As is the case in so many temples, there is an opium-room in
the temple at the back of the gilded shrine, where priests and
neophytes, throwing aside their office, can while away the
licentious hours till the gong calls them again to prayers.</p>

<p>In the early morning, while I was still lying in my pukai on
the floor, I saw many women, a large proportion of whom were
goitrous, come to the hall, and make an offering of rice, and
kneel down before the Buddha. As time went on, and more kept
coming in, small heaps of rice had collected in front of the
chief altar and before the cabinets. And when the women retired,
a chorister came round and swept with his fingers all the little
heaps into a basket. To the gods the spirit! To the priests the
solid remains!</p>

<p>It was in Manyuen, as I have mentioned, that Margary met his
death on February 21st, 1875. He had safely traversed China from
Hankow to Bhamo, had been everywhere courteously treated by the
Chinese and been given every facility and protection on his
journey. He had passed safely through Manyuen only five weeks
before, and had then written: "I come and go without meeting the
slightest rudeness among this charming people, and they address
me with the greatest respect." And yet five weeks later he was
killed on his return! Even assuming that he was killed in
obedience to orders issued by the cruel Viceroy at Yunnan City,
the notorious Tsen Yu-ying, and not by a lawless Chinese
train-band which then infested the district and are believed by
Baber to have been the real murderers, the British Government
must still be held guilty of contributory negligence. Margary,
having passed unmolested to Bhamo, there met the expedition under
Colonel Horace Browne, and returned as its forerunner to prepare
for its entry into China by the route he had just traversed. The
expedition was a "peace expedition" sent by the Government of
Burma, and numbered only "fifty persons in all, together with a
Burmese guard of 150 armed soldiers."</p>

<p>Seven years before, an expedition under Major Sladen had
advanced from Burma into Western China as far as Tengyueh; had
remained in Tengyueh from May 25th to July 13th, 1868; had
entered into friendly negotiations with the military governor and
other Mohammedan officials in revolt against China: and had
remained under the friendly protection of the Mohammedan
insurgents who were then in possession of Western China from
Tengyueh to near Yunnan City. "To what principles," it has been
asked, "of justice or equity can we attribute the action of the
British in retaining their Minister at the capital of an empire
while sending a peaceful mission to a rebel in arms at its
boundaries?"</p>

<p>The Mohammedan insurrection was not quelled till the early
months of 1874. And less than a year later the Chinese learned
with alarm that another peaceful expedition was entering Western
China, by the same route, under the same auspices, and with the
identical objects of the expedition which had been welcomed by
the leaders of the insurrection.</p>

<p>The Chinese mind was incapable of grasping the fact that the
second expedition was planned solely to discover new fields for
international commerce and scientific investigation. Barbarians
as they are, they feared that England thereby intended to "foster
the dying embers of the rebellion." No time for such an
expedition, a peaceful trade expedition, could have been more
ill-chosen. The folly of it was seen in the murder of Margary and
the repulse of Colonel Horace Browne, whose expedition was driven
back at Tsurai within sight of Manyuen. And this murder, known to
all the world, is the typical instance cited in illustration of
the barbarity of the Chinese.</p>

<p>China may be a barbarous country; many missionaries have said
so, and it is the fashion so to speak; but let us for a moment
look at facts. During the last twenty-three years foreigners of
every nationality and every degree of temperament, from the
mildest to the most fanatical, have penetrated into every nook
and cranny of the empire. Some have been sent back, and there has
been an occasional riot with some destruction of property. But
all the foreigners who have been killed can be numbered on the
fingers of one hand, and in the majority of these cases it can
hardly be denied that it was the indiscretion of the white man
which was the exciting cause of his murder. In the same time how
many hundreds of unoffending Chinese have been murdered in
civilised foreign countries? An anti-foreign riot in China--and
at what rare intervals do anti-foreign riots occur in its vast
empire--may cause some destruction of property; but it may be
questioned if the destruction done in China by the combined
anti-foreign riots of the last twenty-three years equalled the
looting done by the civilised London mob who a year or two ago on
a certain Black Monday played havoc in Oxford-street and
Piccadilly. "It is less dangerous," says one of the most accurate
writers on China, the Rev. A. H. Smith, himself an American
missionary, "for a foreigner to cross China than for a Chinese to
cross the United States." And there are few who give the matter a
thought but must admit the correctness of Mr. Smith's
statement.</p>

<p>On May 17th I was on the road again. The fort of Manyuen is
outside the town, and some little distance beyond it the dry
creek bends into the pathway at a point where it is bordered with
cactus and overshadowed by a banyan tree. This is said to be the
exact spot where Margary was killed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII. CHINA AS A FIGHTING POWER.--THE KACHINS.--AND
THE LAST STAGE INTO BHAMO.</h3>

<p>We now left the low land and the open country, the pastures
and meadows, and climbed up the jungle-clad spurs which form the
triangular dividing range that separates the broad and open
valley of the Taiping, where Manyuen is situated, from the
confined and tropical valley of the Hongmuho, which lies at the
foot of the English frontier fort of Nampoung, the present
boundary of Burma. Two miles below Nampoung the two rivers join,
and the combined stream flows on to enter the Irrawaddy a mile or
two above Bhamo.</p>

<p>No change could be greater or more sudden. We toiled upwards
in the blazing sun, and in two hours we were deep in the thickest
jungle, in the exuberant vegetation of a tropical forest. We had
left the valley of the peaceful Shans and were in the forest
inhabited by other "protected barbarians" of China--the wild
tribes of Kachins, who even in Burma are slow to recognise the
beneficent influences of British frontier administration. Nature
serenely sleeps in the valley; nature is throbbing with life in
the forest, and the humming and buzzing of all insect life was
strange to our unaccustomed ears.</p>

<p>A well-cut path has been made through the forest, and caravans
of mules laden with bales of cotton were in the early stages of
the long overland journey to Yunnan. Their bells tinkled through
the forest, while the herd boy filled the air with the sweet
tones of his bamboo flute, breathing out his soul in music more
beautiful than any bagpipes. Cotton is the chief article of
import entering China by this highway. From Talifu to the
frontier a traveller could trace his way by the fluffs of cotton
torn by the bushes from the mule-packs.</p>

<p>The road through the forest reaches the highest points,
because it is at the highest points that the Chinese forts are
situated, either on the road or on some elevated clearing near
it.</p>

<p>The forts are stockades inclosed in wooden palisades, and
guarded by chevaux de frise of sharp-cut bamboo. The barracks are
a few native straw-thatched wooden huts. Perhaps a score or two
of men form the garrison of each fort; they are badly armed, if
armed at all. There are no guns and no store supplies. Water is
trained into the stockades down open conduits of split bamboo. To
anyone who has seen the Chinese soldiers at home in Western
China, it is diverting to observe the credence which is given to
Chinese statements of the armed strength of Western China. How
much longer are we to persist in regarding the Chinese, as they
now are, as a warlike power? In numbers, capacity for physical
endurance, calm courage when well officered, and powers
unequalled by any other race of mankind of doing the greatest
amount of labour on the smallest allowance of food, their
potential strength is stupendous. But they are not advancing,
they are stationary; they look backwards, not forwards; they live
in the past. Weapons with which their ancestors subdued the
greater part of Asia they are loath to believe are unfitted for
conducting the warfare of to-day Should Japan bring China to
terms, she can impose no terms that will not tend towards the
advancement of China. Victories such as Japan has won over China
might affect any other nation but China; but they are trifling
and insignificant in their effect upon the gigantic mass of
China. Suppose China has lost 20,000 men in this war, in one day
there are 20,000 births in the Empire, and I am perfectly sure
that, outside the immediate neighbourhood of the seat of
operations, the Chinese as a nation, apart from the officials,
are profoundly ignorant that there is even a war, or, as they
would term it, a rebellion, in progress. Trouble, serious
trouble, will begin in China in the near future, for the time
must be fast approaching when the effete and alien dynasty now
reigning in China--the Manchu dynasty--shall be overthrown, and a
Chinese Emperor shall rule on the throne of China.</p>

<p>At a native village called Schehleh there is a likin-barrier.
The yellow flag was drooping over the roadway in the hot sun. The
customs officer, an amiable Chinese Shan, invited me in to tea,
and brought his pukai for me to lie down upon. Like thousands of
his countrymen, he had played for fortune in the Manila lottery.
Two old lottery tickets and the prize list in Chinese were on one
wall of his room, on the other were a number of Chinese visiting
cards, to which I graciously permitted him to add mine.</p>

<p>Soldiers accompanied me from camp to camp, Chinese soldiers
from districts many hundreds of miles distant in China. Some were
armed, some were unarmed, and there was equal confidence to be
reposed in the one as in the other; but all were civil, and
watched me with a care that was embarrassing.</p>

<p>At the first camp beyond Schehleh the gateway was ornamented
with trophies of valour. From two bare tree-trunks baskets of
heads were hanging, putrefying in the heat. They were the heads
of Kachin dacoits. And thus shall it be done with all taken in
rebellion against the Son of Heaven, whose mighty clemency alone
permits the sun to shine on any kingdom beyond his borders.
Kachin villages are scattered through the forest, among the
hills. You see their native houses, long bamboo structures raised
on piles and thatched with grass, with low eaves sloping nearly
to the ground. In sylvan glades sacred to the nats you pass
wooden pillars erected by the roadside, rudely cut, and rudely
painted with lines and squares and rough figures of knives, and
close beside them conical grass structures with coloured
weathercocks. Split bamboos support narrow shelves, whereon are
placed the various food-offerings with which is sought the
goodwill of the evil spirits.</p>

<p>The Kachin men we met were all armed with the formidable dah
or native sword, whose widened blade they protect in a
univalvular sheath of wood. They wore Shan jackets and dark
knickerbockers; their hair was gathered under a turban. They all
carried the characteristic embroidered Kachin bag over the left
shoulder.</p>

<p>The Kachin women are as stunted as the Japanese, and are
disfigured with the same disproportionate shortness of legs. They
wear Shan jackets and petticoats of dark-blue; their ornaments
are chiefly cowries; their legs are bare. Unmarried, they wear no
head-dress, but have their hair cut in a black mop with a deep
fringe to the eyebrows. If married, their headdress is the same
as that of the Shan women--a huge dark-blue conical turban.
Morality among the Kachin maidens, a missionary tells me, is not,
as we understand the term believed to exist. There is a tradition
in the neighbourhood concerning a virtuous maiden; but little
reliance can be placed on such legendary tales. Among the Kachins
each clan is ruled by a Sawbwa, whose office "is hereditary, not
to the eldest son, but to the youngest, or, failing sons, to the
youngest surviving brother." (Anderson.) All Kachins chew
betel-nut and nearly all smoke opium--men, women and children.
Goitre is very prevalent among them; in some villages Major
Couchman believes that as many as 25 per cent, of the inhabitants
are afflicted with the disease. They have no written language,
but their spoken language has been romanised by the American
missionaries in Burma.</p>

<p>We camped within five miles of the British border at the
Chinese fortlet of Settee, a palisaded camp whose gateway also
was hung with heads of dacoits. A Chinese Shan was in command, a
smart young officer with a Burmese wife. He was active, alert,
and intelligent, and gave me the best room in the series of sheds
which formed the barracks. I was made very comfortable. There
were between forty and fifty soldiers stationed in the
barracks--harmless warriors--who were very attentive. At
nightfall the tattoo was beaten. The gong sounded; its notes died
away in a distant murmur, then brayed forth with a stentorian
clangour that might wake the dead. At the same time a tattoo was
beaten on the drum, then a gun was fired and the noise ceased, to
be repeated again during the night at the change of guard. All
foes, visible and invisible, were in this way scared away from
the fort.</p>

<p>Hearing that I was a doctor, the commandant asked me to see
several of his men who were on the sick list. Among them was one
poor young fellow dying, in the next room to mine, of remittent
fever. When I went to the bedside the patient was lying down
deadly ill, weak, and emaciated; but two of his companions took
him by the arms, and, telling him to sit up, would have pulled
him into what they considered a more respectful attitude. In the
morning I again went to see the poor fellow. He was lying on his
side undergoing treatment. An opium-pipe was held to his lips by
one comrade, while another rolled the pellet of opium and placed
it heated in the pipe-bowl, so that he might inhale its
fumes.</p>

<p>In the morning the officer accompanied me to the gate of the
stockade and bade me good-bye, with many unintelligible
expressions of good will. His eight best soldiers were told off
to escort me to the frontier, distant only fifteen li. It was a
splendid walk through the jungle across the mountains to the
Hongmuho. We passed the outlying stockade of the Chinese, and,
winding along the spur, came full in view of the British camp
across the valley, half-way up the opposite slope. By a very
steep path we descended through the forest to the frontier fort
of the Chinese, and emerged upon the grassy slope that shelves
below it to the river.</p>

<p>There are a few bamboo huts on the sward, and here the Chinese
guard left me; for armed guards are allowed no further. I was led
to the ford, my pony plunged into the swift stream, and a moment
or two later I was on British soil and passing the Sepoy outpost,
where the guard, to my great alarm, for I feared being shot,
turned out and saluted me. Then I climbed up the steep hill to
the British encampment, Where the English officer commanding,
Captain R. G. Iremonger, of the 3rd Burma Regiment, gave me a
kind reception, and congratulated me upon my successful
journey.</p>

<p>He telegraphed to headquarters the news of my arrival. It was
of no earthly interest to anybody that I, an unknown wanderer,
should pass through safely; but it was of interest to know that
anyone could pass through so easily. Reports had only recently
reached the Government that Western China was in a state of
disaffection; that a feeling strongly anti-foreign had arisen in
Yunnan; and that now, of all times, would it be inexpedient to
despatch a commission for the delimitation of the boundary. My
quiet and uninterrupted journey was in direct conflict with all
such reports.</p>

<p>The encampment of Nampoung is at an elevation of 1500 feet
above the river. It is well exposed on all sides, and has been
condemned by military experts. But the law of fortifications
which applies to any ordinary frontier does not apply to the
frontier of China, where there is no danger whatsoever. The
palisade is irregularly made, and is not superior, of course, to
any round the Chinese stockades.</p>

<p>The houses are built of bamboo, are raised on piles, and
thatched with grass. A company of the 3rd Burma Regiment is
permanently stationed here under an English officer, and consists
of 100 men, who are either Sikhs or Punjabis, all of splendid
stature and military bearing. A picket of six men under a
non-commissioned native officer guards the ford, and permits no
armed Chinese to cross the border.</p>

<p>There are numbers of transport mules and ponies. In the creek
there are plenty of fish; the rod, indeed, is the chief amusement
of the officers who are exiled on duty to this lonely spot to
pass three months in turn in almost uninterrupted solitude. There
is a telegraph line into Bhamo, and it is at this point that
connection will be made with the Imperial Chinese Telegraphs.</p>

<p>At the ford from fifty to one hundred loaded pack-animals,
mostly carrying cotton, cross into China daily. A toll of six
annas is levied upon each pack-animal, the money so collected
being distributed by the Government among those Kachin Sawbwas
who have an hereditary right to levy this tribute. The money is
collected by two Burmese officials, and handed daily to the
officer commanding. No duty is paid on entering Burma. Chinese
likin-barriers begin to harass the caravans at Schehleh.</p>

<p>Beautiful views of the surrounding hills, all covered with
"lofty forest trees, tangled with magnificent creepers, and
festooned with orchids," are obtained from the camp. All the
country round is extremely fertile, yielding with but little
labour three crops a year. Cultivation of the soil there is none.
Fire clears the jungle, and the ashes manure the soil; the ground
is then superficially scratched, and rice is sown. Nothing more
is done. Every seed germinates; the paddy ripens, and, where one
basketful is sown, five hundred basketfuls are gathered. And the
field lies untouched till again covered with jungle. Thus is the
heathen rewarded five-hundred-fold in accordance with the law of
Nature which gives blessing to the labour of the husbandman
inversely as he deserves it.</p>

<p>In the evening the officer walked down with me to the creek,
where I bathed in the shadow of the bank, in a favourite pool for
fishing. As we crossed the field on our return, we met the two
Burmese tribute-gatherers. They had occasion to speak to the
officer, when, instead of standing upright like a stalwart and
independent Chinaman, they squatted humbly on their heels, and,
resting their elbows on their knees in an attitude of servility,
conversed with their superior. How different the Chinaman, who
confesses few people his superior, and none of any race beyond
the borders of China!</p>

<p>From Nampoung to Bhamo is an easy walk of thirty-three miles.
This is usually done in two stages, the halting place being the
military station of Myothit, which is fourteen miles from
Nampoung. On leaving Nampoung, an escort of a lance-corporal and
two soldiers was detailed to accompany me. They were Punjabis,
men of great stature and warlike aspect; but they were presumably
out of training, for they arrived at Myothit, limp and haggard,
an hour or more after we did. There is an admirable road through
the jungle, maintained in that excellent order characteristic of
military roads under British supervision. My Chinese from time to
time questioned me as to the distance. We had gone fifteen li
when Laotseng asked me how much farther it was to Santien
(Myothit). "Three li," I said. We walked ten li further. "How far
is it now?" he asked. "Only five li further," I replied, gravely.
We went on another six li, when again he asked me: "Teacher Mo,
how many li to Santien?" "Only eight more li," I said, and he did
not ask me again. I was endeavouring to give him information in
the fashion that prevails in his own country.</p>

<p>At Myothit we camped in the <i>dak</i> bungalow, an
unfurnished cottage kept for the use of travellers. The
encampment is on the outskirts of a perfectly flat plain, skirted
with jungle-clad hills and covered with elephant grass. Through
the plain the broad river Taiping flows on its muddy way to the
Irrawaddy. One hundred sepoys are stationed here under a native
officer, a Sirdar, Jemadar, or Subadar (I am not certain which),
who called upon me, and stood by me as I ate my tiffin, and, to
my great embarrassment, saluted me in the most alarming way every
time my eye unexpectedly caught his. I confess that I did not
know the gentleman from Adam. I mistook him for an ornamental
head-waiter, and, as I regarded him as a superfluous nuisance, I
told him not to stand upon the order of his going but go. I
pointed to the steps; and he went, sidling off backwards as if
from the presence of royalty. Drawing his heels together, he
saluted me at the stair-top and again at the bottom, murmuring
words which were more unintelligible to me even than Chinese.</p>

<p>During the night our exposed bungalow was assailed by a
fearful storm of wind and rain, and for a time I expected it to
be bodily lifted off the piles and carried to the lee-side of the
settlement. The roof leaked in a thousand places, rain was driven
under the walls, and everything I had was soaked with warm
water.</p>

<p>Next day we had a pleasant walk into Bhamo, that important
military station on the left bank of the Irrawaddy. We crossed
the Taiping at Myothit by a bridge, a temporary and very shaky
structure, which is every year carried away when the river rises,
and every year renewed when the caravans take the road after the
rains.</p>

<p>Bhamo is 1520 miles by land from Chungking; and it is an equal
distance further from Chungking to Shanghai. The entire distance
I traversed in exactly one hundred days, for I purposely waited
till the hundredth day to complete it. And it surely speaks well
of the sense of responsibility innate in the Chinese that, during
all this time, I never had in my employ a Chinese coolie who did
not fulfil, with something to spare, all that he undertook to do.
I paid off my men in Bhamo. To Laotseng I gave 400 cash too many,
and asked him for the change. At once with much readiness he
ranged some cash on the table in the form of an abacus, and,
setting down some hieroglyphics on a sheet of paper, he worked
out a calculation, by which he proved that I owed him 400 cash
and, therefore, the accounts were now exactly balanced. For my
own expenses I gave him 1175 cash in Tengyueh and 400 more in
Bhamo, so that my entire personal expenses between two points
nine days distant from each other were rather more than
3<i>s</i>. My entire journey from Shanghai to Bhamo cost less
than 20 pounds sterling, including my Chinese outfit. Had I
travelled economically, I estimate that the journey need not have
cost me more than 14 pounds. Had I carried more silver with me, I
would still further have reduced the total cost of my tour. The
gold I bought in Yunnan with my surplus silver, I sold in Burma
for 20 per cent. profit; the rupees which I purchased in Tengyueh
for 11<i>d</i>. were worth 13<i>d</i>. in Bhamo. For some curios
which I purchased in the interior for 2 pounds 5<i>s</i>. I was
offered when I reached civilisation 14 pounds. Without doubt the
journey across China is the cheapest that can be done in all the
world.</p>

<p>I was sorry to say good-bye to my men, who had served me so
faithfully. And I cannot speak more highly of the pleasure of my
journey than to declare that I felt greater regret when it was
finished than I ever felt on leaving any other country. The men
all through had behaved admirably, and it is only fair to add
that mine was the common experience of travellers in far Western
China. Thus a very great traveller in China and Thibet (W. W.
Rockhill), writing in the Century, April, 1894, on the
discomforts of his recent journey, says:</p>

<p>"But never a word of complaint from either the Thibetans or my
Chinese. They were always alert, always good-tempered, always
attentive to me, and anxious to contribute to my comfort in every
way in their power. And so I have ever found these peoples, with
whom I am glad to say, after travelling over 20,000 miles in
their countries, I have never exchanged a rough word, and among
whom I think I have left not one enemy and not a few
friends."</p>

<p>Two days after their arrival in Bhamo my three men started on
their return journey to Talifu. They were laden with medicines,
stores, newspapers, and letters for the mission in Tali, which
for months had been accumulating in the premises of the American
Mission in Bhamo, the missionary in charge, amid the multifarious
avocations pertaining to his post, having found no time to
forward them to their destination to his lonely Christian brother
in the far interior. And, had I not arrived when I did, they
could not have been sent till after the rains. A coolie will
carry eighty pounds weight from Bhamo to Tali for 12<i>s</i>; and
I need hardly point out that a very small transaction in teak
would cover the cost of many coolies. Besides, any expenditure
incurred would have been reimbursed by the Inland Mission. My
three men were pursued by cruel fate on their return; they all
were taken ill at Pupiao. Poor "Bones" and the pock-marked coolie
died, and Laotseng lay ill in the hotel there for weeks, and,
when he recovered sufficiently to go on to Tali, he had to go
without the three loads, which the landlord of the inn detained,
pending the payment of his board and lodging and the burial
expenses of his two companions.</p>

<p><a name="ch-23"></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII. BHAMO, MANDALAY, RANGOON, AND CALCUTTA.</h3>

<p>The finest residence in Bhamo is, of course, the American
mission. America nobly supports her self-sacrificing and devoted
sons who go forth to arrest the "awful ruin of souls" among the
innumerable millions of Asia, who are "perishing without hope,
having sinned without law." The missionary in charge told me that
he labours with a "humble heart to bring a knowledge of the
Saving Truth to the perishing heathen among the Kachins." His
appointment is one which even a worldly-minded man might covet. I
will give an instance of his methods. This devoted evangelist
told me that a poor woman, a Kachin Christian, in whose welfare
he felt deep personal interest, was, he greatly feared dying from
blood-poisoning at a small Christian village one hour's ride up
the river from Bhamo; and he had little doubt that some surgical
interference in her case would save her life. I at once offered
to go and see her. I had received great kindness from many
American missionaries in China, and it would give me great
pleasure, I said, if I could be of any service.</p>

<p>The missionary professed to be grateful for my offer, but,
instead of arranging to go that afternoon, named seven o'clock
the following morning as the hour when he would call for me to
take me to the village. At the time appointed I was ready; I
waited, but no missionary came. There was a slight drizzle,
sufficient to prevent his going to the sick woman but not
sufficient to deter him from going to market to the Irrawaddy
steamer, where I accidentally met him. So far from being abashed
when he saw me, he took the occasion to tell me what he will, I
know, pardon me for thinking an inexcusable untruth. He had
written, he said, to the poor woman telling her, dying as he
believed her to be, to come down to Bhamo by boat to see me.</p>

<p>In Bhamo I stayed in the comfortable house of the Deputy
Commissioner, and was treated with the most pleasant hospitality.
To my regret, the Deputy Commissioner was down the river, and I
did not see him. He is regarded as one of the ablest men in the
service. His rise has been rapid, and he was lately invested with
the C.I.E.--there seems, indeed, to be no position in Burma that
he might not aspire to. In his absence his office was being
administered by the Assistant Commissioner, a courteous young
Englishman, who gave me my first experience of the Civil Service.
I could not but envy the position of this young fellow, and
marvel at the success which attends our method of administering
the Indian Empire. Here was a young man of twenty-four, acting as
governor with large powers over a tract of country of hundreds of
square miles--a new country requiring for its proper
administration a knowledge of law, of finance, of trade,
experience of men, and ability to deal with the conflicting
interests of several native races. Superior to all other
authorities, civil and military, in his district he was
considered fit to fill this post--and success showed his
fitness--because a year or two before he had been one of forty
crammed candidates out of 200 who had taken the highest places in
a series of examinations in Latin, English mathematics, etc. With
the most limited experience of human life, he had obtained his
position in exactly the same way that a Chinese Mandarin does
his--by competitive examination in subjects which, even less than
in the case of the Chinese, had little bearing upon his future
work; and now, like a Chinese Mandarin, "there are few things he
isn't."</p>

<p>On the face of it no system appears more preposterous; in its
results no system was ever more successful. The Assistant
Commissioner early learns self-reliance, decision, and ability to
wield authority; and he can always look forward to the time when
he may become Chief Commissioner.</p>

<p>There is a wonderful mixture of types in Bhamo. Nowhere in the
world, not even in Macao, is there a greater intermingling of
races. Here live in cheerful promiscuity Britishers and Chinese,
Shans and Kachins, Sikhs and Madrasis, Punjabis, Arabs, German
Jews and French adventurers, American missionaries and Japanese
ladies.</p>

<p>There are many ruined pagodas and some wooden temples which,
however, do not display the higher features of Burmese
architecture. There is a club, of course; a polo and football
ground, and a cricket ground. Inside the fort, among the
barracks, there is a building which has a double debt to pay,
being a theatre at one end and a church at the other, the same
athletic gentleman being the chief performer at both places. But,
at its best, Bhamo is a forlorn, miserable, and wretched station,
where all men seem to regard it as their first duty to the
stranger to apologise to him for being there.</p>

<p>The distinguished Chinese scholar and traveller, E. Colborne
Baber, who wrote the classic book of travel in Western China, was
formerly British Resident in Bhamo. He spoke Chinese unusually
well and was naturally proud of his accomplishment. Now the
ordinary Chinaman has this feature in common with many of the
European races, that, if he thinks you cannot speak his language,
he will not understand you, even if you speak to him with perfect
correctness of idiom and tone. And Baber had an experience of
this which deeply hurt his pride. Walking one day in the
neighbourhood of Bhamo, he met two Chinese--strangers--and began
speaking to them in his best Mandarin. They heard him with
unmoved stolidity, and, when he had finished, one turned to his
companion and said, as if struck with his discovery, "the
language of these foreign barbarians sounds not unlike our
own!"</p>

<p>In Bhamo I had the pleasure of meeting the three members of
the Boundary Commission who represented us in some preliminary
delimitation questions with the Chinese Government. A better
choice could not have been made. M. Martini, a Frenchman, has
been twenty years in Upper Burma, and is our D.S.P. (District
Superintendent of Police). Mr. Warry, the Chinese adviser to the
Burmese Government, is one of the ablest men who ever graduated
from the Consular Staff in China; while Captain H. R. Davies, of
the Staff Corps, who is on special duty in the Intelligence
Department, is not only an exceptionally able officer, but is the
most accomplished linguist of Upper Burma. These were the three
representatives.</p>

<p>I sold my pony in Bhamo. I was exceedingly sorry to part with
it, for it had come with me 800 miles in thirty days, over an
unusually difficult road, at great variations of altitude, and
amid many changes of climate. And it was always in good spirit,
brave and hardy, carrying me as surely the last twenty miles as
it had the first twenty. Yet, when I came to sell it, I was
astonished to learn how many were its defects. Its height, which
was 12.3 in Nampoung, had shrunk three days later to 11.3 in
Bhamo. This one subaltern told me who came to look at the pony
with the view, he said, of making me an offer. Another officer
proved to me that the off foreleg was gone hopelessly; a third
confirmed this diagnosis of his friend, and in a clinical lecture
demonstrated that the poor beast was spavined, and that its near
hind frog was rotten, "as all Chinese ponies' are," he added. One
of the mounted constabulary, a smart officer, fortunately
discovered in time that the pony was a roarer; while the
Hungarian Israelite who lends help on notes of hand, post-obits,
personal applications, and other insecurities, and is on terms of
friendly intimacy with most of the garrison, when about to make
an offer, found, to his great regret, that the pony's hind legs
were even more defective than the fore. The end of it was that I
had to sell the pony--for what it cost me. I am indebted to the
Reverend Mr. Roberts, of the American Baptist Mission, for
helping me to sell my pony. Mr. Roberts has a pious gift for
buying ponies and selling them--at a profit. He offered me 40
rupees for my pony. I mentioned this offer at the Bhamo Club,
when a civilian present at once offered me 50 rupees for the
pony; he did not know the pony, he explained, but--he knew
Roberts.</p>

<p>In a steamer of the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company I came down the
river from Bhamo to Mandalay. When I left the Commissioner's
bungalow, the entire staff of the establishment and of some
neighbouring bungalows assembled to do me honour, creeping up to
me, and with deep humility carrying each an article of my
possessions from my room down to the porch. There were the dhobie
and bearer, the waterman with his goatskin waterbag, the
washerman who washed my blue Chinese garments as white as his
own, the syce who did not collect grass, the cook who sent me ten
bad eggs in three days, and the Christian Madrasi, the laziest
rascal in Bhamo, who early confessed to me his change of faith
and the transformation it had effected in the future prospects of
his soul. There was the Burmese watchman, and the
English-speaking Burmese clerk, and the coolie who went to the
bazaar for me, and many others. They lined the stairs as I came
out, and placed their hands reverently to their foreheads when I
passed by. It was pleasant to see such disinterested evidence of
their good will, and my only regret was that I could not reward
them according to their deserts. But to the Chinese coolie who
was grinning to see my paltry outfit carried by so many hands,
and who gathered together all I possessed and swung off with it
down past the temples to the steamer landing in the native city,
I gave a day's pay, and cheerfully--though he then asked for
more.</p>

<p>In Mandalay I was taken to the club, and passed many hours
there reading the home papers and wandering through its gilded
halls. Few clubs in the world have such a sumptuous setting as
this, for it is installed in the throne-room and chambers and
reception-halls of the palace of King Theebaw.</p>

<p>In the very centre of the building is a seven-storeyed spire,
"emblematic of royalty and religion," which the Burmese look upon
as the "exact centre of creation." The reception-hall at the foot
of the throne is now the English chapel; the reading-room with
its gilded dais where the Queen sat on her throne, with its lofty
roof, its pillars of teak, and walls all ablaze with gilding, was
the throne-room of Theebaw's chief Queen.</p>

<p>Mandalay is largely Chinese, and on the outskirts of the city
there is a handsome temple which bears the charming inscription,
so characteristic of the Chinese, "enlightenment finds its way
even among the outer barbarians."</p>

<p>There is a military hospital with two nursing sisters, highly
trained ladies from Bart.'s. Australians are now so widely
distributed over the world that it did not surprise me to find
that one of the two sisters comes from Melbourne.</p>

<p>From Mandalay I went by train to Rangoon, where I lived in a
pretty villa among noble trees on the lower slope of the hill
which is crowned with the famous golden pagoda, the
"Shway-dagon," the most sacred temple of Indo-China. We looked
out upon the park and the royal lake. I early went to the
Intelligence Department and saw Major Couchman. In his office I
met the chief Chinese interpreter, a Chinaman with a rare genius
for languages. He is a native of Fuhkien province, and, of
course, speaks the Fuhkien dialect; he knows also Cantonese and
Mandarin. In addition, he possesses French, Hindustani, Burmese,
Shan, and Sanscrit, and, in an admirable translation which he has
made of a Chinese novel into English, he frequently quotes Latin.
Fit assistant he would make to Max Muller; his services command a
high salary.</p>

<p>The Chinese in Rangoon are a predominating force in the
prosperity of the city. They have deeply impressed their
potentiality upon the community. "It seems almost certain," says
a great authority, perhaps the greatest authority on Burma--J. G.
Scott (Shway Yoe)--"that in no very long time Burma, or, at any
rate, the large trading towns of Burma, will be for all practical
purposes absorbed by the Chinese traders, just as Singapore and
Penang are virtually Chinese towns. Unless some marvellous
upheaval of energy takes place in the Burmese character, the
plodding, unwearying Chinaman is almost certainly destined to
overrun the country to the exclusion of the native race."</p>

<p>The artisans of Rangoon are largely Chinese, and the
carpenters exclusively so. The Chinese marry Burmese women, and,
treating their wives with the consideration which the Chinaman
invariably extends to his foreign wife in a foreign country, they
are desired as husbands even above the Burmans. Next to the
British, the only indispensable element in the community is now
the Chinese.</p>

<p>The best known figure in Burma is the Reverend John Ebenezer
Marks, D.D., Principal of the St. John's College of the S.P.G.
Dr. Marks has been thirty-five years in Burma, is still hale and
hearty, brimful of reminiscences, and is one of the most amusing
companions in the world. I think it was he who converted King
Theebaw to Christianity. His school is a curiosity. It is an
anthropological institute with perhaps the finest collection of
human cross-breeds in existence. It is away out beyond the gaol,
in large wooden buildings set in extensive playgrounds. Here he
has 550 students, all but four of whom are Asiatics of fifteen
different nationalities--Chinese, Karens, Kachins, Shans, and a
varied assortment of Hindoos and Malays, both pure and blended
with the native Burmese. All the different races represented in
Burma have intermarried with the native Burmese, and the
resulting half-breeds have crossed with other half-breeds. Most
of the better class Eurasian boys (European-Asian) are educated
here some being supported by their fathers, some not. The former
Dr. Marks ingeniously calls after their mothers; the latter, who
have been neglected, retain the names (when they are known), of
their fathers. It is amusing to meet among the latter the names
of so many brave Englishmen who, in the earlier days when morals
had not attained the strictness that now characterises them,
gallantly served their country in Burma.</p>

<p>No woman in the world is more catholic in her tastes than the
Burmese. She bestows her loves as variously as the Japanese. She
marries with equal readiness Protestant or Catholic, Turk,
Infidel, or Jew. She clings cheerfully to whichever will support
her; but above all she desires the Chinaman. No one treats her so
well as the Chinaman. If she is capable of experiencing the
emotion of love for any being outside her own race, she feels it
for the Chinaman, who is of a cognate race to her own, is
hardworking, frugal, and industrious, permits her to live in
idleness, and delights her with presents, loving her children
with that affection which the Chinaman has ever been known to
bestow upon his offspring. The Chino-Burmese is not quite the
equal of his father, but he is markedly superior to the Burmese.
The best half-caste in the East is, of course, the Eurasian of
British parentage. Englishmen going to Burma are, as a rule,
picked men, physically powerful, courageous, energetic, and
enterprising; for it is the possession of these qualities which
has sent them to the East, either for business or in the service
of their country. And their Burmese companions--of course I speak
of a condition of things which is gradually ceasing to exist--are
all picked women, selected for the comeliness of their persons
and the sweetness of their manners.</p>

<p>After a stay of two or three weeks in Rangoon, I went round by
the British India steamer to Calcutta. Ill fortune awaited me
here. The night after my arrival I was laid down with remittent
fever, and a few days later I nearly died. The reader will, I am
sure, pardon me for obtruding this purely personal matter. But,
as I opened this book with a testimony of gratitude to the
distinguished surgeon who cut a spear point from my body, where
nine months before it had been thrust by a savage in New Guinea,
so should I be sorry to close this narrative without recording a
word of thanks to those who befriended me in Calcutta.</p>

<p>I was a stranger, knowing only two men in all Calcutta; but
they were friends in need, who looked after me during my illness
with the greatest kindness. A leading doctor of Calcutta attended
me, and treated me with unremitting attention and great skill. To
Mr. John Bathgate and Mr. Maxwell Prophit and to Dr. Arnold Caddy
I owe a lasting debt of gratitude. And what shall I say of that
kind nurse--dark of complexion, but most fair to look upon--whose
presence in the sick room almost consoled me for being ill? Bless
her dear heart! Even hydrochlorate of quinine tasted sweet from
her fingers.</p>
