<p>Production Notes:</p>
<p>The various typographical schemes used in "Early Tasmania" are
not consistent from paper to paper; each separate scheme has been
retained here.</p>
<p>In this electronic format, the marginal references have been
omitted, but a few marginal dates retained [ in ] to assist
readers. Each footnote has been placed at the end of the relevant
paragraph. The order of Papers 5 and 6 has been reversed so as to
group similar topics. In the lists of Aboriginal words, the
symbol for "y breve" has been rendered "&#375;". The CONTENTS
table has been expanded one level, and the CHARTS labelled below
them. Various spellings of names, <i>e.g.</i> "Heemskirk", "Zeehan",
etc., stand. A few obvious typographical errors have been corrected.</p>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.<br>
<br>
<small>JAMES BACKHOUSE WALKER, F.R.G.S.</small></h3>
<p align="center"><small>(Born 14th Oct., 1841; died 4th Nov.,
1899,)</small></p>
<p><small>IT</small> is the privilege of the writer to have known
the late and much lamented Mr. James Backhouse Walker, F.R.G.S.,
through all his life, and he has been asked to supply a short
memorial preface to the following papers which were read before
the Royal Society of Tasmania.</p>
<p>Mr. Walker was born at Hobart in the year 1841. His father,
Mr. George Washington Walker, was a well-known and much respected
member of the Society of Friends, and transmitted his simple and
altruistic ways to his children. In the early years of these
Colonies he was deputed, with Mr. Backhouse, by the Society of
Friends, to visit the Australian settlements, and to inquire into
and report upon their social condition. They did so at much cost
of time and labour, and their representations were not without
effect on the Colonial Office in Downing-street, which, in the
old times, was the most perfunctory of State Institutions, very
ignorant, very indifferent, and very contemptuous of communities
which they regarded as almost wholly made up of the scum of the
Empire. When his mission was fulfilled, Mr. Walker, the elder,
came back to Tasmania, took his place as a leader in
philanthropic work, and became Manager of the Savings Bank in
Hobart, and occupied the position to the time of his death. At an
early age the son, James, was sent to school in England, and when
he came back to his home was a pupil of the late Rector of the
High School, the Rev. E. D. Poulett-Harris. As a scholar, he was
steady, bright, and intelligent, and much regarded by his fellows
for his simple and genial ways. Even then he was prone to wander
in the paths of literature, and cared more for Homer than Euclid.
In due time he passed the A.A. Examination of the Council of
Education, and when he left school he was put on the staff of the
Savings Bank, under the charge of his father. No doubt the
discipline of his work as an accountant was of great service to
him through all his subsequent career, but it was very irksome,
and made no appeal to his ambition. He determined to give it up,
and to qualify himself for the legal profession, though it might
involve the patience of years. Through all his routine work he
drank deeply from the wells of general literature, and
passionately studied many of the masters of immortal memory. He
knew, though he never made a parade of his knowledge. In the
practise of his profession he took a high stand, and won the
confidence and esteem of his brethren for his sound judgment,
integrity, and honour, and they have shown their appreciation of
his work by contributing to the foundation of a scholarship in
his memory in the University of Tasmania.</p>
<p>Mr. Walker, as might be expected from his bringing up, was
very sympathetic with all movements for the uplifting of our
social and moral condition, though sufficiently alive to the
futility of many well-meant but ill-considered schemes of doing
good. He had a singular power of winning the affection and
confidence of young people, who believed in his judgment, and
trusted in his good will. He took boys one by one with a due
consideration for their personal equation, and many a Tasmanian
lad owes much of his success in life to the wise and sympathetic
counsels of their friend. Little children gathered round him as
they did about Lewis Carroll, and clung to him with perfect trust
and joy. He was, at any rate, very lovable to them all.</p>
<p>Mr. Walker was a broad-minded man, and he took an intelligent
and sympathetic interest in scientific research of every kind,
though he never claimed to be an expert in many questions
discussed at the meetings of the Royal Society. The special bent
of his mind was towards literature and history. The story of our
earliest Australian days was to him a theme deserving the most
careful study, and that ought to be rightly told and thoroughly
sifted. To know about Tasman and the first discoverers he thought
worth painstaking labour; and to correct the legends that have
gathered round the fact as it was, seemed to him almost a
religious duty. He would take nothing at second hand if he could
help it, but went back to the original sources, even to
ransacking the archives of Holland for anything that would throw
light on Tasman and his career. And so it was all through, and
his papers show how hard he worked to secure accuracy where
accuracy was possible.</p>
<p>Next, if next, to Mr. Walker's interest in the Royal Society,
was his interest in the cause of higher education, though,
indeed, it was as a branch of higher education that he set so
much value on the work of scientific research, which the Royal
Society was designed to promote. He had much to do with starting
the University of Tasmania, and guiding and supporting it through
the difficulties of its earliest years. He was, perhaps, the
hardest worker in the Council, and certainly he was second to no
one in wise and loyal service to the Institution. His colleagues
in the University know best the loss that they have suffered by
Mr. Walker's passing from among us.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are sacred things on which one can hardly
touch in a paper like this, but, perhaps, in the circumstances, I
may be allowed to say that my dear friend seemed to me to be a
man who tried to pitch his life to the old Hebrew oracle, "He
hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord
require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk
humbly with thy God."</p>

<h3>THE FRENCH IN VAN DIEMEN'S LAND,<br>
AND THE FIRST SETTLEMENT<br>
AT THE DERWENT.</h3>
<p align="center"><small>BY JAMES BACKHOUSE WALKER.<br>

(Read November, 1888.)</small><br>

<h4>PREFATORY NOTE.</h4>
<p>As the subject of the present Paper may appear to be scarcely
within the scope of the objects of the Royal Society, it seems,
proper to state briefly the occasion of its being written and
submitted to the consideration of the Fellows.</p>
<p>Some two years ago, the Tasmanian Government&mdash;of which
the Hon. James Wilson Agnew, Honorary Secretary of the Royal
Society, was Premier&mdash;following the good example set by the
Governments of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia,
Queensland, and New Zealand, directed search to be made in the
English State Record Office for papers relating to the settlement
and early history of this Colony. The idea originated in a
suggestion from Mr. James Bonwick, F.R.G.S., the well-known
writer on the Tasmanian Aborigines, who had been employed for
years on similar work for various Colonial Governments, and to
him the task was entrusted by Dr. Agnew. Mr. Bonwick searched,
not only the Record Office, but the papers of the Admiralty, the
Foreign Office, the Privy Council, and the British Museum, and
discovered and copied a large mass of documents relating to the
early days of Tasmania. In the early part of this year, these
copies, extending over some 640 foolscap pages, were received in
Hobart, and the present Premier&mdash;the Hon. Philip Oakley
Fysh&mdash;obligingly allowed me to peruse them. I found them to
be of great interest. They threw quite a new light on the causes
which led to the first occupation of this Island; gave a complete
history of Bowen's first settlement at Risdon Cove; and supplied
materials for other hitherto unwritten chapters of Tasmanian
history. Upon informing Mr. Fysh of the result of my examination,
he entered warmly into my proposal to put before the public in a
narrative form the information acquired, and placed the documents
at my disposal for that purpose. It is at Mr. Fysh's suggestion
that this first paper on the subject is now submitted to the
Royal Society. The introductory sketch of the operations of the
French in Tasmania has been compiled from the original published
narratives of the expeditions. Some history of preceding events
seemed necessary for a proper understanding of the transactions
referred to in the documents under notice. My object has been,
not to give a history of the discovery and early exploration of
our Island, but merely such an outline of the rivalries of the
French and English in these seas as would suffice for a better
apprehension of the motives which prompted the first occupation
of the Derwent.</p>
<p>The story of the first settlement of Tasmania, and of
Lieutenant Bowen's little colony at Risdon Cove, has never yet
been told, so far as I can discover. West, Fenton, and other
authors give meagre, inaccurate, and contradictory particulars.
No writer records even the date of Bowen's landing. Mr. Bonwick's
researches now, for the first time, enable us to give this
missing first chapter of Tasmanian history.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a></p>
<h4>I. THE FRENCH IN VAN DIEMEN'S LAND.</h4>
<p>The Cambridge Professor of Modern History, in a recent
remarkable book, has shown that the great English event of the
18th century, indeed, the greatest fact of modern English
History, has been the expansion of England into lands beyond the
seas&mdash;the foundation and growth of a Greater Britain.
Professor Seeley holds that the great hundred years' struggle
between England and France, lasting from the time of Louis XIV.
to the days of Napoleon, was, in the main, a duel between the two
nations for the possession of the New World. Even in the English
conquest of India the Professor traces, not so much the ambition
of conquest and the lust of empire, as fear of the French and
rivalry with them. By the close of the last century the issue of
the strife was no longer doubtful. In India, Wellesley had
annihilated French influence, and was rapidly consolidating the
English dominion. France had lost for ever her finest possessions
in America, though she, on her side, had dealt us a return blow
in assisting to tear from England her North American
Colonies.</p>
<p>But the struggle was not over, and it was destined to yield
yet wider triumphs for the English race. The very humiliation
which, France had helped to inflict on her rival was to prove a
potent factor in the further expansion of "Greater Britain". It
is probably no exaggeration to say that it is to the hostility of
France, and her action in America, that we owe in no small
measure the British colonisation of Australia&mdash;a work which
must ever stand as the most momentous event of our century.</p>
<p>The secession of her North American provinces had well nigh
left England without a colonial empire. Englishmen straightway
set themselves to search for a compensation for their lost
possessions, and to And a new outlet for their energies and for
their surplus population. A new world lay ready to their hand. As
David Livingstone, in our own days, has called into existence a
new realm in the dark continent of Africa, so in the days of our
great grandfathers, the genius of Captain Cook, England's
greatest circumnavigator, had opened up a new realm in the
unknown and mysterious seas of the South. But in these Southern
seas, as formerly in America and India, England and France were,
and indeed still are, rivals. In exploration each nation can
boast of distinguished names. The English navigators, Anson,
Vancouver, Cook, Furneaux, and Flinders, had active competitors
in the Frenchmen, Bougainville, Marion, Surville, La
P&eacute;rouse, D'Entrecasteaux, and Baudin. Nor were the English
the first to entertain the design of colonising the new lands. So
far back as the year 1756, an eminent and learned French
advocate, M. le President Charles de Brosses, in his <i>Histoire
des Navigations aux Terres Australes</i>, had strongly urged upon
the Government of France the wisdom of establishing a French
colony in the South seas. In the work cited the author passes in
review the relative advantages of various portions of the
Southern world, and concludes that some part of Australasia *
offers the best prospects for settlement, the country being
favourable, and access easy, with Pondicherry as a base of
operations.** He rejects New Zealand and Van Diemen's Land as
too remote; and after hesitating for a while over Quiros' Terre
du St. Esprit (the coast between Cooktown and Townsville),
finally inclines to New Britain as the most suitable locality.
With a sagacious foresight, since amply justified by events, he
declares that any colony planted in these regions would hold
Ariadne's clew for the whole Southern world. From such a centre,
every part of this new realm could in time be explored and
conquered, from the Equator to the Antarctic Circle. He
elaborately discusses the best means of forming such a
settlement, and recommends that after its first establishment a
certain number of convicts, male and female, should be sent to it
every year to supply the necessary labour, and to be in time
transformed from a danger and burden to the State into
industrious and useful citizens.*** Still further to strengthen
the new colony, he would deport to it, as free citizens, numbers
of foundlings, who are in a sense the property of the State which
has reared them, and can therefore dispose of them at its
pleasure. He warns his countrymen against the danger of waiting
until some other nation had proved the practicability of a colony
by trying the experiment; for when once any nation has gained a
foothold it will not suffer another to share the territory to
which it has thus acquired a right by conquest.**** Although
various discovery expeditions were despatched from France to the
South Seas after the days of De Brosses, the President's warning
remained unheeded. France missed her opportunity, and it was left
to England to take the first step, and found a new empire in
these southern seas, from which&mdash;justifying the Frenchman's
forecast&mdash;she did not scruple from the very first
peremptorily to warn off all intruders.</p>
<p class="foot">[* De Brosses was President of the Parliament of
Dijon. To him we owe the invention of the name
<i>Australasia</i>. Nav. aux Terres Aus., i., 80.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Nav. aux Terres Aust., ii., 367, et seq.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>Ibid</i>., i., 28, et seq.]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** <i>Ibid</i>., ii., 408.]</p>
<p>It was probably due to the fact of the coincidence of Captain
Cook's discoveries with the loss of the American colonies, quite
as much as to her naval supremacy, that England chanced to be
beforehand with her rival. It takes an effort of imagination to
realise the New World which Cook revealed, and how he opened up
to men's minds the possibilities and promise of the new field for
enterprise. Until his time, New Holland&mdash;for as yet
Australia was not *&mdash;had been little more than a
geographical expression. Parts of the Northern and Western
coasts, and one ominous Bay of Storms at the South, were laid
down more or less vaguely on the maps from the reports of Dutch
navigators of the preceding century, and those old and infrequent
voyagers had brought back only reports of forbidding shores and
desolate territory. The right to these dreary coasts was conceded
without dispute to the Dutch, for it was a land that no man
desired. The English had no part in its discovery. One
Englishman, indeed, and one only&mdash;William Dampier&mdash;had
touched on the Western coast in the year 1688, had found a barren
sandy soil, inhabited by wretched savages, with no redeeming
advantage, and had left it gladly, thinking it the most miserable
spot on the face of the earth. Such was the state of affairs when
Cook appeared on the scene. In 1770, on his return from the
observation of the Transit of Venus at Tahiti, and in pursuance
of instructions to try to solve the mystery of the great South
Land, the <i>Endeavour</i>, after rediscovering and surveying the
islands of New Zealand, sailed west till the eastern shore of New
Holland was sighted. Cook explored the coast from Cape Howe to
Cape York; landed at Botany Bay, hoisted the English flag, took
possession of the country in the name of King George, and
returned home to report the existence of a fine and fertile
territory in a temperate climate, well suited for English
settlers. At home the growth of feeling in favour of a milder
penal code had rendered it necessary to devise some scheme for
disposing of criminals, and Pitt and the English Government
resolved to choose Botany Bay as the field for a project which
should relieve English difficulties, and lay the foundation of a
new colony. The first fleet sailed from England, and in January,
1788, Governor Phillip planted the first settlement in New
Holland, substantially on the lines indicated in detail by the
French President more than a quarter of a century before.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Quiros (1606) named his discovery Australia
del Espiritu Santo, in honour of Philip of Austria. Purchas, in
his English translation of Quiros' voyage (1625) called it
Australia Incognita&mdash;(<i>See</i> Petherick's Bibliography of
Australasia). Dalrymple, in his Collection of Voyages (1770)
suggests the name, and Flinders revived it in the Introduction to
his Voyage to Terra Australis, 1814, p. iii.]</p>
<p>But the French had never ceased to turn longing eyes towards
the new Southern world. If the mind of France had not been so
fully occupied in the desperate effort to maintain her naval
power against the English in other seas, it is quite possible
that to her, and not to England, would have fallen the dominion
of Australia. And, probably, suspicion of French designs had its
effect in hastening English action. Already, in 1785, the French
Government had despatched the celebrated La P&eacute;rouse with
an expedition to circumnavigate the world, and explore the coasts
of New Holland, doubtless, with some more or less definite design
of settlement. When, on the 26th January, 1788, La
P&eacute;rouse, with his ships, the <i>Boussole</i> and the
<i>Astrolabe</i>, sailed into Botany Bay, he found an English
fleet at anchor there, having arrived five days before him.
Governor Phillip had just left the Bay in the <i>Supply</i> to
find in Port Jackson a more suitable site for a town; and on the
very day La P&eacute;rouse's ships came to an anchor the city of
Sydney was founded. The French remained in Botany Bay for six
weeks, the English and they maintaining a friendly and pleasant
intercourse. Collins says that the French were very unfavourably
impressed with the prospects of the settlement, the officers
having been heard to declare that in their whole voyage they had
never found so poor a country, or such wretched people as the
natives of New South Wales. On the 10th March La P&eacute;rouse
sailed from New South Wales to vanish into space&mdash;the
mystery which shrouded his fate not being solved until nearly 40
years had elapsed.</p>
<p>The English foothold on the Australian continent was now
securely established, and disregarding the western half, to with
the Dutch were still considered as having a title&mdash;something
like their present title to Western New Guinea&mdash;England, by
solemn proclamation, formally laid claim to the whole eastern
territory from Cape York to the extreme South Cape of Van
Diemen's Land, and as far west as the 135th degree of east
longitude.</p>
<p>Still France did not relinquish her dreams of colonisation,
but seemed to cherish the idea of disputing with her great rival
her exclusive possession of the new territories. There is reason
to think that the French designs, if ever distinctly formulated,
pointed to the southern extremity of Van Diemen's Land as the
locality for a settlement. The Terre de Di&eacute;men and the
Baie des Temp&ecirc;tes exercised a particular fascination over
successive French navigators, and excited the attention of the
French Government. It was a spot known only for a forbidding
rock-bound coast, washed by an angry sea, and lashed by perpetual
tempests. For more than a century after its discovery by Abel
Tasman in 1642 no European had invaded its solitudes, until on
the 4th March, 1772, the French navigator, Marion du Fresne,
anchored his ships, the <i>Mascarin</i> and the <i>Castries</i>,
in the Frederic Hendric Bay of Tasman.** He remained there six
days, landed, and attempted to establish intercourse with the
natives, the attempt resulting in an encounter in which the first
Tasmanian aborigine fell under the fire of European muskets.
After Marion, the English, navigators Furneaux (1773) Cook
(1777), Cox (1789), and Bligh (1788 and 1792) paid passing visits
to Adventure Bay; but it was a Frenchman, again, who made the
first survey of the approaches to the Derwent. The instructions
to La P&eacute;rouse in 1785 had directed him to explore this,
the extreme southern point of New Holland; and the last letter
written by him from Botany Bay, on 7 February, 1788, notes his
intention to proceed there before his return,&mdash;an intention
there is some reason to believe he executed.*** The exploration
was made four years later by Admiral Bruny D'Entrecasteaux,
Commander of the expedition sent out by the National Assembly in
1791 to search for the missing navigator. It was to Storm Bay
that his ships, the <i>Recherche</i> and <i>Esperance</i>, first
directed their course from the Cape of Good Hope. The autumn of
1792 was far advanced before the French Admiral sighted the
basaltic cliffs of Van Diemen's Land. Through an error of his
pilot, Raoul, he missed Adventure Bay, which he had intended to
make, and on 21st April cast anchor at the entrance of the inlet
afterwards known to the English as Storm Bay Passage, but which
now more fittingly bears the name of D'Entrecasteaux Channel,
after its discoverer. Recherche Bay, close at hand, offered a
safe and commodious harbour for the ships; and here they remained
for a month, their boats exploring and surveying the channel and
the various inlets on the coast, while the scientific men
journeyed inland, made observations, collected specimens of
natural history, and revelled in the examination of a new flora
and fauna. The natives, at first timid and distrustful, were soon
conciliated, and showed themselves most friendly to the
Europeans. On the 17th May the ships entered the Channel, and the
French viewed with astonishment the extent of the harbours which
unfolded themselves to their delighted gaze, affording a secure
shelter spacious enough to contain easily the combined fleet of
all the maritime powers of Europe. After a fortnight employed in
examining the Channel, the Admiral sailed out of the Passage into
Storm Bay, rounded the Pillar, and proceeded to New Caledonia. In
the summer of the following year he returned to Van Diemen's
Land, and spent another five weeks in the Channel (21 January to
28 February, 1793). During the second stay the French completed
the surveys which they had begun in the preceding autumn,
explored Norfolk Bay and Frederick Henry Bay (Baie du Nord), and
ascended 20 miles up the Derwent, which they named Rivi&egrave;re
du Nord. Flinders, with his usual generous recognition of the
work of previous navigators, says of the charts of Beautems
Beaupr&eacute;, the hydrographer of the expedition, that "they
contain some of the finest specimens of marine surveying perhaps
ever made in a new country." Labillardi&egrave;re, the naturalist
and historian of the expedition, devotes more than 160 pages of
his work to a description of the Terre de Diemen. He speaks with
enthusiasm of the country and its productions, of its magnificent
forests of blue-gum and other timber, of its soil and fertility,
and of the amiability of its peaceful inhabitants, and dilates
with pardonable pride and satisfaction on the grandeur and extent
of the harbours which French enterprise had discovered in this
hitherto dreaded coast. The lengthened stay of D'Entrecasteaux,
the minute and elaborate nature of his surveys, and the space his
historian devotes to a description of the country and its
advantages, indicate some further object than mere geographical
research. The names which stud our southern coast, and are
familiar in our mouths as household words,&mdash;Bruny Island,
D'Entrecasteaux Channel, Recherche Bay, Port Esperance, River
Huon, Cape Raoul, and others,&mdash;stand a perpetual monument to
the memory of the French navigators.</p>
<p class="foot">[** This it not the Frederick Henry Bay of the
colonists, but that marked on the maps as Marion Bay, on the East
Coast.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Bent's Almanac for 1827 states that in the
year 1809 Captain Bunker, of the ship <i>Venus</i>, found, buried
on the shore of Adventure Bay, a bottle containing letters from
La P&eacute;rouse dated one month after his leaving Port Jackson.
In the year 1826 Captain Peter Dillon discovered traces of La
P&eacute;rouse's expedition at Vanikoro, in the Santa Cruz
Group.]</p>
<p>And now, at length, English explorers appear upon the scene.
In 1794, Lieut. John Hayes, of the India Navy, was despatched
from India in the ships <i>Duke of Clarence</i> and
<i>Duchess</i> on a voyage of discovery, including the
exploration of the coasts of Van Diemen's Land. He sailed up the
Rivi&egrave;re du Nord&mdash;which he re-christened the
Derwent&mdash;as far as Herdsman's Cove. As the admirable charts
of D'Entrecasteaux were unknown to the English until long years
after, it was on Hayes' sketch that subsequent visitors had to
rely, and in many cases the names he gave have been substituted
for those given by the French.</p>
<p>In December, 1797, the adventurous Bass, leaving Port Jackson
in an open whaleboat, had solved the vexed problem of the strait
which bears the name and immortalises the intrepid daring of its
discoverer; and late in the year 1798, Bass and Flinders, in the
<i>Norfolk</i>, a little sloop of 25 tons, sailed through Bass'
Strait, explored Port Dalrymple, circumnavigated Tasmania, and
made a careful examination and survey of the Derwent and its
approaches and neighbourhood.</p>
<p>On the 19th October, 1800, when Bonaparte was first Consul, an
expedition, consisting of two ships, the <i>G&eacute;ographe</i>
and <i>Naturaliste</i>, sailed out of Havre, amidst great
demonstrations, for a voyage of discovery round the world.
Commodore Baudin, in the <i>G&eacute;ographe</i>, was chief of
the expedition; Captain Hamelin commanded the <i>Naturaliste</i>.
Although fierce war was raging at the time between the two
nations, the English Admiralty granted a passport or safe conduct
to Baudin, on the ground that scientific expeditions should be
exempt from hostilities. Notwithstanding these courtesies of the
English Government to the French commander, it was shrewdly
suspected that the real design of the expedition was to spy out
the state of the English possessions in New Holland, and, if
practicable, hoist the standard of Bonaparte at some convenient
point of the coast and establish a French colony. Certain it is
that Baudin's instructions&mdash;afterwards published in
P&eacute;ron's account of the voyage&mdash;give colour to the
belief. They direct the captain to proceed direct from the
Mauritius to the southern point of the Terre Diemen, double the
South Cape, carefully examine the Canal D'Entrecasteaux in every
part, ascend all the rivers in this portion of the island as far
as they were navigable, explore all the eastern coast, carefully
survey Banks' Straits, sail through Bass' Strait, and after
exploring Hunter's Islands, proceed to the continent of New
Holland and search for the great strait which was supposed to
separate the eastern part occupied by the English, from the
western portion claimed by the Dutch. All this certainly looks
very like some further object than geographical discovery. The
French expedition doubtless stirred the English to renewed
activity, and through the influence of Sir Joseph Banks, Earl
Spencer (then at the head of the Admiralty) consented, early in
1801, to despatch the <i>Investigator</i>, a sloop of 334 tons,
to make a complete survey of the coast of New Holland. The
command was given to Lieut. Matthew Flinders, who had already
distinguished himself by some daring explorations in company with
Dr. George Bass: and amply did he justify his appointment. The
ship's complement was 88 persons, amongst whom served, as a
midshipman, John Franklin, afterwards destined, as Sir John
Franklin, to become Governor of Tasmania, and to die in solving
the problem of the North-West Passage. The <i>Investigator</i>
sailed from Spithead on the 18th July, 1801, and sighted Cape
Leeuwin on 6th December following. Meantime Commodore Baudin,
deviating from his instructions, had gone to the western coast of
Australia, and it was not until the 13th January, 1802, that he
sighted the De Witts Islands (known to our fishermen as "The
Witches"), off the south coast of this island. The French
commander anchored next day off Partridge Island, in the Channel;
remained there until the 17th February&mdash;36 days; occupied
the warm summer season in making a very complete examination and
survey of the Channel, the River Huon and Port Cygnet, Frederick
Henry and Norfolk Bays, and exploring the Derwent carefully
nearly as far as Bridgewater. The French had many interviews with
the natives, doing everything in their power to conciliate them,
and with complete success. P&eacute;ron, the naturalist, who
wrote the history of the expedition, devotes nearly 100 pages of
his first volume to Van Diemen's Land. He gives a glowing
description of the beauty and capabilities of the country, and a
poetical and highly-coloured picture of the kindliness and good
qualities of the aborigines. On leaving Storm Bay the Frenchmen
sailed for the east coast; they examined Maria Island, visited
the Schoutens and Freycinet's Peninsula, and surveyed the
remainder of the coast until they reached Banks' Strait. Here the
ships were separated by a storm. The <i>Naturaliste</i> surveyed
Banks' Strait, and explored the Hunter Islands and other islands
in Bass' Strait; and the <i>G&eacute;ographe</i> sailed for the
south coast of New Holland&mdash;or, as Baudin christened it,
Napoleon Land&mdash;to search for the channel which was supposed
to divide New Holland. The French expedition had surveyed the
whole coast-line of Van Diemen's Land, with the exception of the
west coast from Cape Grim to Port Davey.</p>
<p>On the 8th April, 1802, the ships of Baudin and Flinders met
off Kangaroo Island. Flinders states that Baudin was
communicative of his discoveries in Van Diemen's Land, and
declares that he, on his part, furnished the French commander
with every information as to his own explorations of the coast,
and gave him directions for his guidance. P&eacute;ron, in his
brief notice of the interview between the two commanders, simply
remarks that Flinders showed great reserve on the subject of his
own operations. The object of this suppression of facts by the
Frenchman will appear later on.</p>
<p>On the 25th April, 1802, Captain Hamelin, in the
<i>Naturaliste</i>, arrived off Port Jackson. His provisions were
exhausted, his crew prostrated by scurvy. He was in urgent need
of succour. Yet he approached Port Jackson with many misgivings.
War, so far as he knew, was raging in all its bitterness and fury
between France and England, and though he bore a safe conduct
from the Admiralty, he fully anticipated that he would not be
allowed to enter the Port, or, if he was, that the aid he so much
needed would be refused him. But his doubts were soon dispelled,
for, as he says, he was instantly welcomed by the English with
magnanimous generosity. Not only were all the resources of the
country placed at the disposal of the French captain, but the
most distinguished houses of the colony were thrown open to his
officers, and during the whole time they remained they
"experienced that delicate and affectionate hospitality which is
equally honourable to those who confer it and to those who are
its objects." The news of the Peace of Amiens (proclaimed 27
March, 1802), which reached Sydney a short time later, though it
made intercourse more pleasant, "could not", P&eacute;ron says,
"increase the kindness which the English displayed towards us." A
fortnight later (May 9) Flinders, who had completed a thorough
survey of the South Coast, arrived at Port Jackson in the
<i>Investigator</i>.</p>
<p>Baudin, in the <i>G&eacute;ographe</i>, had been some six
weeks on the South coast of New Holland, rediscovering and
renaming the discoveries already made by Flinders. His crew were
suffering terribly from scurvy, and his officers urged his going
to Port Jackson to recruit. Whether the Commodore doubted the
nature of his reception, or whether the attractions of the Terre
de Diemen proved irresistible, does not appear, but Baudin
disregarded their protests, and to their intense chagrin, though
winter was fast approaching, headed his ship for the cold and
stormy south, and on 20th May once more cast anchor in Adventure
Bay. The state of his ship's company, however, was such that
after only two days' stay he was obliged to give orders to sail
for Sydney. Baffled by contrary winds, battered by violent
storms, with a crew unable, from illness, to handle the ship, it
took him a whole month to make the passage. On the 20th June the
G&eacute;ographe approached the heads of Port Jackson. Not only
were they apprehensive respecting the fate of the
<i>Naturaliste</i>, and as to the nature of their own reception,
but the condition of the crew was most deplorable. Flinders says
"it was grievous to see the miserable condition to which both
officers and crew were reduced by scurvy, there being, according
to the commander's account, out of 170 men not more than 12
capable of doing their duty." P&eacute;ron quotes the Commander's
journal as stating that but four of the crew, including a
midshipman, were able to keep the deck, and he adds "there was
not one on board who was free from the disease." Many had died,
and the surgeon, M. Taillefer, gives a horrible description of
the sufferings of the survivors.* In fact, on arriving off Port
Jackson the <i>G&eacute;ographe</i> was unable to make the
harbour, until Governor King had sent the <i>Investigator</i>'s
boat with a number of hands to work the vessels into port. It is
hardly necessary to say that the distressed Frenchmen were
received with the greatest kindness. The numerous sick were
removed to the Colonial Hospital, and tenderly cared for by the
English surgeons. Whatever they had need of that the place could
furnish was placed at their disposal, and the Governor gave the
Commander an unlimited credit at the Public Treasury to enable
him to revictual and refit, and also purchase a third vessel.
More than this: the Colony was at the time in great want of fresh
provisions, floods on the Hawkesbury having destroyed the wheat
harvest, salt meat was exceedingly scarce, and fresh meat almost
unprocurable; yet so soon as the strangers' necessities were
known, Government oxen were killed, and by a common consent the
ration of wheat issued to garrison and inhabitants, including the
Governor and officers, was reduced one-half, so that the
scurvy-stricken crew might not want what was so essential for
their recovery. This statement is made on the authority of a
letter written by Baudin himself. Both he and P&eacute;ron
handsomely acknowledge the kindness they received, and exhaust
their phrases in describing the affectionate and obliging care of
Governor King and his unexampled conduct, the courtesy and
unremitting attention of the inhabitants, the generosity of the
Government, the absolute freedom accorded to their movements, and
the sentiments of gratitude which these kindnesses inspired.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The scurvy was at this period the scourge of
the naval and mercantile marine, and especially of discovery
expeditions. Vancouver attributes the high position England had
attained, in a great degree, to the attention her captains paid
to naval hygiene. The French discovery crews always suffered
terribly from want of proper precautions, and from P&eacute;ron's
account Baudin's ships were miserably victualled, and their
commander culpably indifferent to the health of his men. Out of
23 scientific men who left France in the <i>G&eacute;ographe</i>
and <i>Naturaliste</i> only three returned to their country. Out
of 219 men who sailed with D'Entrecasteaux, 89 died before the
ships returned to Mauritius. The French voyages of discovery were
singularly fatal to their commanders. Besides La P&eacute;rouse,
who perished with all his ship's company, not one of the
commanders who visited Tasmania lived to return to his native
country. Marion du Fresne was killed at New Zealand. Admiral
D'Entrecasteaux died at sea off the Admiralty Isles, and his
second in command, Huon Kermadec, at New Caledonia. Baudin
himself died at Mauritius on the voyage home.]</p>
<p>I have dwelt particularly on these incidents, not only because
it is matter of pardonable pride to record how chivalrously
Englishmen can behave towards an enemy in distress, but because
of the striking contrast which the aid and courtesies extended to
the Frenchmen by Governor King and the English colonists offer to
the treatment Flinders experienced from the Governor of a French
Colony within little more than a year of the arrival of Baudin's
expedition at Sydney. In December, 1803, on his way to England in
the little <i>Cumberland</i>, Flinders was obliged to put into
Mauritius in distress; when, in spite of his safe conduct from
the French Admiralty, his ship was seized as a prize, he himself
subjected to close imprisonment, his papers and charts
confiscated, and when, after three years, tardy orders for his
release came from France, he was detained on one pretext or
another until 1810, six years and a half after his seizure. In
the meantime the narrative of Baudin's voyage was published in
Paris, all mention of Flinders' explorations being suppressed,
and the credit of his discoveries being claimed by the French for
themselves. In Sydney, at any rate, the French officers had made
no pretensions to priority of discovery, for Flinders tells us
that Lieut. Freycinet (the joint editor of the history of the
voyage), remarked to him, in Governor King's
house&mdash;"Captain, if we had not been kept so long picking up
shells and collecting butterflies at Van Diemen's Land, you would
not have discovered the South Coast [of New Holland] before us;"
and Flinders, in P&eacute;ron's presence, showed his chart to
Baudin and pointed out the limits of his discovery. Flinders
generously acquits P&eacute;ron of blame in the matter, and says
that he believes his candour to have been equal to his
acknowledged abilities, and that what he wrote was from
overruling authority, and smote him to the heart. He attributes
the suppressions in P&eacute;ron's work, and his own treatment,
to the secret instructions of the French Government, and possibly
to have "been intended as the forerunner of a claim to the
possession of the countries so said to have been first discovered
by French navigators."</p>

<h4>II. THE FIRST SETTLEMENT AT THE DERWENT.</h4>
<p>The foregoing sketch of the operations of the French
navigators in these waters will, I think, have made ii pretty
plain that the French Government entertained serious designs of
planting a colony at the first convenient opportunity somewhere
in Tasmania, presumably in the neighbourhood of the Derwent. How
disastrous to the English colonies in Australia the successful
accomplishment of such a design would have been we can partly
appreciate from our recent experience of the trouble and vexation
caused to the Australians by the existence of a French penal
settlement even so far removed from our shores as New
Caledonia.</p>
<p>The following particulars of the circumstances which were the
immediate occasion of the English occupation of Van Diemen's Land
are drawn almost wholly from unpublished documents preserved in
the English State Record Office, and which I have already
referred to as having been lately copied by Mr. Bonwick for the
Tasmanian Government. They will show that the colonisation of
Tasmania was not an isolated or chance event, but one link of a
chain,&mdash;a ripple in the great current of influence which has
been shaping English and European history.</p>
<p>On the 18th November, 1802, after a six months' stay, the two
French ships sailed out of. Port Jackson for Bass' Straits. The
<i>Naturaliste</i> was intended to take home the sick, leaving
the <i>G&eacute;ographe</i> to complete her voyage of discovery
alone. Governor King had not been without misgivings respecting
the movements of the French, and had given expression to them in
a despatch to Lord Hobart written a few days before; but his
suspicions only proceeded from the circumstance of the long time
they were engaged in surveying at Storm Bay Passage. Moreover,
the recent discovery of Bass' Straits, by proving Van Diemen's
Land to be an island, had given rise to a new cause for
apprehension, since it might now be fairly contended that the
island could not form part of the territory of New South Wales,
and that the English, having no prior right of discovery, could
not make good their claim, while the French expeditions, by their
explorations and surveys, had established a superior title. But a
few hours after the French ships were out of sight, a piece of
gossip reached the Governor's ears which fairly startled him out
of his equanimity. This was a report that some of the French
officers had stated, in conversation with Lieut.-Colonel Paterson
and others, possibly in a convivial moment, that a principal
object of their voyage was to fix on a place at Van Diemen's Land
for a settlement. The alarmed Governor sent off forthwith to
Colonel Paterson for more precise information, and the answer he
received, on that same Tuesday morning on which the ships had
sailed, more than confirmed his worst fears. Not only had the
talk among the French officers been so general that the Colonel
could not understand how it was that the Governor had not heard
of it, but one of the officers had sent Paterson a chart, and had
pointed out the very spot selected&mdash;the place where they and
D'Entrecasteaux also had spent so much time&mdash;the Baie du
Nord [now known as Frederick Henry Bay], in Storm Bay Passage,
or, as the French called it, Le Canal D'Entrecasteaux. King, of
course, knew very well that Baudin could, at most, take formal
possession, for, with his small and sickly crew, and without
stores or provisions, he had not the means to found a colony.
There was no immediate danger on that score, but he did not know
what recommendations might have been sent to the French
Government, or how soon a properly equipped expedition might be
on its way from France to plant a settlement, and, being a man of
action, accustomed to act promptly and on his own responsibility,
without waiting for instructions that might be twelve months in
reaching him, he proceeded forthwith to take steps to prevent an
invasion of His Majesty's territory of New South Wales, of which
territory he was the guardian. His first difficulty was to find a
ship. The naval strength at the command of the Governor of New
South Wales was not large. His Majesty's ships in these seas were
few in number, small, and often unseaworthy, and there was a
constant difficulty in finding vessels that could be spared for
any special service. Of those under his orders the <i>Buffalo</i>
was essential at Port Jackson, the <i>Lady Nelson</i> was off
north with Flinders, the <i>Porpoise</i>, the only other king's
ship, was away at Tahiti salting pork for the necessities of the
colony. But there was in Port Jackson a little armed schooner
called the <i>Cumberland</i>, which had been built at Sydney a
few years before for the purpose of pursuing runaways. She was
only 29 tons burden, it is true, but she would do to checkmate
French designs. This little craft was therefore hastily prepared
for sea, a crew was selected, Lieut. Chas. Robbins, master's mate
of H.M.S. <i>Buffalo</i>, was put in command, and in four days
she was ready to sail. Robbins received several sets of
instructions, indicating the uncertainty into which the Governor
was thrown. His general instructions required him to proceed
without loss of time to Storm Bay Passage,&mdash;"the dominion of
which, and all Van Diemen's Land, being", says King, "within the
limits of His Majesty's territory and my government,"&mdash;and
to fix on the most eligible places in Frederick Henry Bay and the
River Derwent, agreeable to the separate instructions on that
head. If, however, Robbins met with southerly or westerly winds,
he was to go to King's Island and Port Phillip, for the
examination and survey of which places he had separate
instructions, and afterwards proceed to Storm Bay Passage. He was
to hoist the English flag whenever on shore, placing a guard at
each place, who were to turn up the ground and sow seeds. As the
<i>Porpoise</i> was intended to follow with soldiers and settlers
immediately on her return from Tahiti, he was to keep the King's
colours flying to indicate the intended settlement. Captain
Robbins was also charged with a letter from King to the French
commander, if he should happen to overtake him in Bass' Straits;
and he received very precise instructions respecting the action
he was to take to assert English rights if the French ventured to
infringe them. Having his preparations made, and his little
vessel ready for sea, King sat down to report to Lord Hobart the
position of affairs. He tells the Secretary for War * that, on
hearing Colonel Peterson's report, he had lost no time in
expediting the <i>Cumberland</i>, armed colonial schooner; that
she was on the point of sailing, and that, from the arrangements
he had made, His Majesty's claim to the threatened part of this
territory could not be disputed; for, whatever might be in
contemplation, it could not be performed by Baudin in his present
condition; it was only necessary to guard against any action of
the French Government which Baudin might have recommended. It was
his intention, therefore, when the <i>Porpoise</i> arrived from
Tahiti, to despatch her with a small establishment to the most
eligible spot at Storm Bay Passage, and also with one for Port
Phillip or King's Island.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Secretary for War was also at that time
Minister for the Colonies.]</p>
<p>The <i>Cumberland</i> sailed the same day (23rd November). She
had on board Mr. Charles Grimes ** (Acting Surveyor-General),
M'Callum (the surgeon), Jas. Flemming (the gardener), and three
marines; with the crew, 17 persons. In the journal *** kept by
Flemming, the gardener, who was sent to report on the soil and
productions of the almost unknown regions to which they were
going, we have a chronicle of their proceedings.**** They had a
quick run of two days to Cape Howe, but, baffled by contrary
winds and calms, were nine days more in reaching Kent's Group,
and it was not until the 8th December&mdash;a fortnight after
leaving Port Jackson&mdash;that they made Sea Elephant Bay, on
the east coast of King's Island. Here they found the French ships
lying at anchor, and at 5 o'clock on that summer evening the
little <i>Cumberland</i> dropped anchor alongside them. The
<i>Naturaliste</i> was on the point of sailing for France.
Captain Robbins boarded the <i>G&eacute;ographe</i>, announced
his mission, and delivered to the Commodore the Governor's
letter. It was short, and friendly in tone. King begins by
remarking that his intention to send a vessel to the southward,
to fix on a place for a settlement, was already known to Baudin
himself. He then mentions the report that had led to the
departure of this vessel being hastened, and goes on to say that,
while wholly disbelieving that the French commander had any
thought of such a design as had been imputed to him, yet it
seemed but proper that he should be informed of the rumour, and
of the orders the captain of the <i>Cumberland</i> had received
in consequence. The version of the Governor's letter given by
P&eacute;ron in his history of the expedition represents it as
couched in more forcible and less conciliatory terms.
P&eacute;ron says that hardly Lad they anchored at King's Island
when the little schooner <i>Cumberland</i> arrived from Port
Jackson, bringing Surveyor-General Grimes, who had been sent by
Governor King to make a declaration, as singular in its form as
it was remarkable in its object. "A report having reached me,"
wrote Mr. King to our Commander, "that you entertain a design of
leaving some people either at Diemen's Land or on the south-west
coast of New South Wales, to found a French Colony there, I deem
it my duty to declare to you, Monsieur le Commandant, that, by
virtue of the proclamation of 1788 whereby England formally took
possession, all these countries form an integral part of the
British Empire, and that you cannot occupy any part of them
without breaking the friendly relations which have been so
recently re-established between the two nations. I will not even
attempt to conceal from you that such is the nature of my
positive instructions on this point that it will be my duty to
oppose by every means in my power the execution of the design you
are supposed to have in view. Accordingly, H.M.S.
<i>Cumberland</i> has received orders not to leave you until the
officer in command of her is convinced that your proceedings are
wholly unconnected with any attempt at invasion of the British
territory in these parts." ***** With King's own copy of his
letter before us ****** we can hardly accept P&eacute;ron's
version as accurate. Probably, while professing to give the
letter textually, he really relied on his memory, and interwove
the substance of the English Captain's verbal communications to
the Commodore. It is sufficiently clear, however, that Robbins,
with the downrightness of a sailor, had left nothing doubtful or
ambiguous with respect to the object of his mission. During the
week after the arrival of the <i>Cumberland</i> and the delivery
of the despatches, the representatives of the two nations
fraternised and interchanged hospitalities on the disputed shores
of King's Island. The French, meanwhile, set up an observatory on
land, and pitched their tents near the beach. Perhaps it was
this proceeding that confirmed Robbins' suspicions, or perhaps
the French Commander would not give him the assurances he wanted;
at all events, before the end of the week the Englishman made up
his mind that the time for decisive action had come; so, on the
14th, he made a formal lading in full view of the Frenchmen,
marched his little party to the rear of the tents, hoisted His
Majesty's colours on a large tree, posted at the foot of the tree
his guard of three marines with loaded muskets, fired three
volleys, gave three cheers, and took formal possession of the
island in the name of King George. This defiant assertion of
British claims by a handful of English sailors, in the teeth of
ten times their number of traditional enemies, might well have
wounded the vanity of people less susceptible than Frenchmen, and
we need not, therefore, wonder that we hear of no more mutual
hospitalities. P&eacute;ron remarks that "such proceedings may
probably seem childish to people unacquainted with the English
policy, but to the statesman such formalities have a more
important and serious aspect. By these repeated public
declarations England continually aims at strengthening her claim,
and establishing her rights in a positive fashion, and uses these
pretexts to repel, even by force of arms, all nations who may
desire to form settlements in these lands." * P&eacute;ron must
often have recalled to mind the warning of the President of the
Parliament of Dijon half a century before, and reflected with
some bitterness how amply the prophecy had been fulfilled.</p>

<p class="foot">[* The high-handed and exclusive policy of the
English is a frequent topic of complaint in P&eacute;ron's work.
Thus, he relates that two days after leaving Port Jackson they
fell in with a schooner, on board of which was a M. Coxwell from
the Isle of France, who had accompanied another Frenchman,
Lecorre, on a sealing cruise to Bass' Straits in the
<i>Enterprise</i>, of Bordeaux. He goes on to explain that, while
other nations had been indifferent to the importance of New
Holland, England had, in 1788, despatched a fleet thither and
founded a Colony, and had, without remark from European
statesmen, taken possession of half the Continent. Emboldened by
the silence of other Governments, the British Government had
published the instructions to Governor Phillip claiming the
country from Cape York to the South Cape (lat. 10&deg; to 43&deg;
S.), and as far to the West as the 135th parallel, besides all
the islands in the Pacific, and had established a policy of
exclusion of other nations from the fisheries. So that, on the
arrival of the <i>Enterprise</i>, Governor King, although peace
had been declared, warned Lecorre off the coast under a threat of
seizing his vessel, and, though he finally allowed the Frenchman
to fish at the Two Sisters, it was only on the condition that he
should undertake not to enter Bass' Straits, and that no vessels
in future would be allowed even so much indulgence. Lecorre's
vessel was wrecked at the Two Sisters, and he himself and
two-thirds of his crew perished. P&eacute;ron says it is plain
that the intentions of the English Government are so hostile that
it will be dangerous for other speculators to venture into these
waters. (P&eacute;ron's Voyage, 2nd ed., vol. 3, p. 3.)<br>
<br>
Governor King, in a despatch to the Admiralty (9th May, 1803),
states his intention of restricting seal fishing by foreigners;
and, in another despatch to Lord Hobart, referring to Lecorre's
vessel, remarks with some satisfaction that the French schooner
had been wrecked at the Cape Barren Islands, "which may stop more
adventurers from that quarter."]</p>
<p>The French Commander's answer to Governor King's letter is
worthy of notice, as showing that the French had by no means
relinquished their claim to a share of Australian territory. His
letter is dated from the <i>G&eacute;ographe</i>, and bears date
the 3rd of the month Nivose, in the 11th year of the French
Republic (23rd December, 1802). He tells King that the arrival of
the <i>Cumberland</i>, and especially the letter which the
Governor had done him the honour to write, would have surprised
him if Mr. Robbins had not, by his conduct, made clear to him the
true motive of the expedition which had been despatched after him
in such headlong haste. "But, perhaps", says the Commodore,
"after all, it may have come too late, for several days before
the gentleman who commands it thought proper to hoist his flag
above our tents, we had taken care to place in four prominent
parts of this island&mdash;which I intend shall continue to bear
your name&mdash;proofs sufficient to show the priority of our
visit." He then declares that the report-of which they suspected
Captain Anthony Fenn Kemp to have been the author, was entirely
without foundation, and he does not believe that his officers or
scientific men had by their conduct given any ground for it.
"But," he concludes, "in any case, you ought to have been
perfectly certain that if the French Government had given me
orders to establish myself in any place, either at the north or
at the south of Diemen's Land&mdash;discovered by Abel
Tasman&mdash;I should have done so without keeping it a secret
from you." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** See Appendix B for Baudin's letter.]</p>
<p>A week after the date of his letter to King (31st December),
Baudin sailed from King's Island for the Gulf of Carpentaria, and
from thence made his way to Mauritius, where he died.
Surveyor-General Grimes and Flemming spent some six weeks in a
thorough exploration of King's Island.*** Their report of the
island as a place for settlement was unfavourable. They then
proceeded in the <i>Cumberland</i> to Port Phillip, where they
remained six weeks, Grimes making an accurate survey of the Port
both by sea and land, discovering the River Yarra, and bringing
away a more favourable impression of the country, but, as King
says, with no very promising hopes that either that place or
King's Island would ever be found an eligible place for an
agricultural settlement. On leaving Port Phillip, Robbins sailed
direct for Port Jackson, where he arrived on 7th March, having
been absent about three months and a half. It does not appear why
he did not fulfil the rest of his instructions, and go on to
Storm Bay Passage. Perhaps, having seen the French ships sail
away to the westward, and fairly off the English premises, he
conceived the danger to be at an end. King, at any rate, was
perfectly satisfied, and writes to the Admiralty that Robbins had
conducted the service entrusted to him very much to his
satisfaction, and remarks that "making the French Commander
acquainted with my intention of settling Van Diemen's Land was
all I sought by this voyage."</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The island was in those days a favourite
resort of sealers. P&eacute;ron says that when they reached Sea
Elephant Bay the beach was covered with sea elephants, their
brown colour making them strikingly visible on the white strand,
where they lay like great black rocks. At the approach of the
French some of the animals plunged into the sea, roaring
frightfully, while others remained motionless on the sand gazing
on their visitors with a placid and indifferent air. In he same
year Captain Campbell, of the <i>Snow Harrington</i>, at New
Year's Island, on the western side of King's Island, in 10 weeks
(19th March to 27th May) killed 600 sea elephants and 4300
seals.]</p>
<p>The fear that the French might yet make a descent on Van
Diemen's Land still weighed on King's mind. As we have seen,
before the <i>Cumberland</i> sailed he had determined to send the
<i>Porpoise</i>, on her arrival from Tahiti, to make a
settlement. The return of Robbins with unfavourable reports of
King's Island and Port Phillip had satisfied him that neither of
those places was adapted for settlement, and he once more fixed
his attention on the point which, now that Baudin had left Bass'
Straits, appeared to be most threatened. He, therefore, resolved
to limit his action to Storm Bay Passage, and immediately took
steps to carry out his resolution.</p>
<p>He reported his intention to the Admiralty, and says in his
despatch, "My reasons for making this settlement are the
necessity there appears of preventing the French gaining a
footing on the east side of these islands; to divide the
convicts; to secure another place for obtaining timber with any
other natural productions that may be discovered and found
useful; the advantages that may be expected by raising grain; and
to promote the seal fishery."</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Governor King was in perfect accord
with the Home Government in his apprehension of French designs,
and in his policy of anticipating them by occupying important
points "for political reasons".*</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Professor Seeley on Napoleon's intentions
in the war that ensued on the rupture of the Peace of Amiens,
18th May, 1803. Exp. of England, p. 34.]</p>
<p>Already, in January of this very year, the Authorities in
Downing-street had determined to form a settlement at Port
Phillip, and had selected Lieut.-Col. David Collins to be its
Lieutenant-Governor, and the date corresponds with the
communications that King had made to the English Government with
respect to Baudin's expedition.</p>
<p>Five months later (24th June, 1803), in consequence of King's
despatch of 23rd November, 1802, informing the Admiralty of the
report that the French were about to colonise Van Diemen's Land,
Lord Hobart instructed the Governor to remove part of the
establishment at Norfolk Island to Port Dalrymple, "the
advantageous position of which, upon the <i>southern</i> coast of
Van Diemen's Land and near the <i>eastern</i> entrance of Bass Straits,
renders it, in a political view, peculiarly necessary that a
settlement should be formed there." The amusing confusion of
localities does not say much for the state of geographical
knowledge at Downing-street, but the anxiety of the Government to
anticipate French action is very clearly indicated.</p>
<p>The Governor's mind was now firmly made up to establish a
colony at the Derwent, but some months were yet to elapse before
he could carry out his plans. One of his difficulties had been to
find, out of the slender establishment at Port Jackson, a
competent officer to whom he could entrust the command of the
intended settlement. The arrival of H.M.S. <i>Glatton</i> at
Sydney, in March, 1803, relieved him from this embarrassment.
There was on board the <i>Glatton</i> a Lieutenant who had made
several voyages to the colony, and so far back as 1792 had been
engaged in conveying cattle and provisions from Bengal to New
South Wales in the <i>Atlantic</i> storeship, at a time of great
scarcity.** He was a son of Commissioner Bowen,*** and we have
King's testimony that he came of a family various members of
which, including his father, had distinguished themselves in the
navy during the French wars. Peace had now been declared, and
Lieut. John Bowen saw little prospect of speedy promotion. When,
therefore, the Governor spoke of the difficulty he was in through
not being able to find a man competent to take charge of the
Derwent establishment, it occurred to Bowen that here was a
chance for him to earn a claim to notice as the founder of a new
colony, and so possibly win a promotion he could hardly hope for
as a junior lieutenant in time of peace. He obtained Captain
Colnett's permission, and offered his services to the Governor.
King was glad to accept them, and on 28th March, 1803, he issued
a Commission, in which, after premising that it had become
necessary to establish His Majesty's right to Van Diemen's Land,
within the limits of the territory of New South Wales, he
directed Lieut. John Bowen to proceed in H.M. armed tender
<i>Lady Nelson</i> to choose a suitable place for an
establishment, and appointed him Commandant and Superintendent of
the settlement. The more detailed instructions to the new
Commandant, bearing the same date as the commission, direct him
to proceed in H.M. armed vessel <i>Porpoise</i>, or <i>Lady
Nelson</i> tender, with people and stores for a settlement, and
fix on a proper spot in the Derwent, about Risdon's Cove; to
begin immediately to clear ground and sow wheat and other crops;
and to furnish full reports on the soil, timber, capabilities,
and productions of the country. He was to have six months'
provisions; was to employ the convicts in labour for the public
good; to hold religious services every Sunday; and to enforce a
due observance of religion and good order. No trade or
intercourse was to be allowed with any ships touching at the
port. Arrangements were to be made for laying out a town,
building fortifications, and appropriating land for cultivation
on the public account. The free settlers who accompanied him, in
consideration of their being the first to volunteer, were to have
a location of 200 acres for each family, and be allowed rations,
the labour of two convicts each for 18 months, and such corn,
seeds, and other stock as could be spared. Bowen also received
sealed orders with respect to any French ships which might
arrive; he was to inform them of His Majesty's right to the whole
of Van Diemen's Land, and was to repel any attempt to form a
settlement,&mdash;if possible, without recourse to hostile
measures.</p>
<p class="foot">[** So Mr. Bonwick, who gives an extract of a
letter from Bowen to the Under-Secretary of State, dated from the
storeship <i>Atlantic</i>, March, 1792; Collins, however, gives
the name of the Admiralty Agent on board the <i>Atlantic</i> as
Richard Bowen. Collins, New South Wales, i., 174.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Jorgensen's Shred of Autobiography in Ross'
Almanac, 1835.]</p>
<p>Another three months elapsed after Bowen had received his
Commission before King had vessels at his disposal which he could
spare for the service. It was not until the 30th June, 1803, that
at last the <i>Porpoise</i> and <i>Lady Nelson</i> sailed from
Port Jackson with the Commandant and people and stores for the
Derwent. Yet even then the attempt was destined to be thwarted
for a time. Both ships were much out of repair and sadly leaky,
and on leaving Port Jackson they met with such strong head winds
that they were compelled to give up all idea of proceeding on
their voyage, and put back to the harbour, arriving on the 4th
July. The <i>Porpoise</i> was now required to take Flinders to
England, and, after undergoing repairs, she sailed on 10th
August, only to be lost a week afterwards, in company with the
<i>Cato</i>, on Wreck Reef, to the north of Rockhampton (Lat.
22&deg; 11' S.). King forthwith ordered the Colonial vessel
<i>Francis</i> to be fitted out to accompany the <i>Lady
Nelson</i> on a second attempt, and wrote to Lord Hobart that he
hoped these ships would complete the service, which he deemed the
more essential from the inclination the French had shown to keep
up a correspondence with Port Jackson.</p>
<p>In those days the exigencies of the service compelled
Governors to take whatever offered to aid them in accomplishing
their plans. Many were the missions of relief or mail despatch
that were entrusted to whalers, or even American sealers, and
their remuneration was sometimes odd enough. Thus, on one
occasion, Governor King desired Governor Collins to pay for the
despatches sent to him by a sealing sloop going to King's Island,
by giving the skipper 30 empty salt-meat casks&mdash;surely as
odd a postage as ever was paid. And it must be admitted that at
times the Yankees fleeced the Britishers handsomely for the
humane help they afforded&mdash;for a consideration.</p>
<p>Let us be thankful that it was not a Yankee sealing schooner
that carried the first Governor of Tasmania to the seat of his
Government, but a British whaler, which turned up at the right
moment&mdash;the <i>Albion</i>, 326 tons&mdash;whose skipper,
Captain Ebor Bunker, was afterwards well known at the Derwent
Settlement in early times.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* In 1809, when in the ship <i>Venus</i>, he put
into Adventure Bay, and there found a bottle containing the last
letters of the unfortunate La P&eacute;rouse. And his name is yet
perpetuated on a tombstone at Crayfish Point, near Hobart, which
records that under it lies buried James Batchelor, Second Officer
of the ship <i>Venus</i>, commanded by E. Bunker, and that he
died 28th January, 1810.]</p>
<p>On the 31st August, 1803, the <i>Albion</i> and <i>Lady
Nelson</i> set sail from Port Jackson. The <i>Lady Nelson</i>
took the bulk of the people and stores. She was a brig of 60 tons
burden, and had been originally sent out in 1800 under the
command of Lieutenant Grant to explore the newly-discovered Bass'
Straits. A little while before she had been employed as a tender
to Flinders' vessel, the <i>Investigator</i>, on the survey of
the coast within the Great Barrier Reef. She was commanded by
Acting Lieutenant C. G. Curtoys, and had for Chief Officer the
redoubtable Dane, Jorgen Jorgensen, the conqueror of Iceland. The
same plan of colonisation with convicts and a few free settlers
that had obtained in the planting of the settlement at Port
Jackson 15 years before, and in settling Norfolk Island in 1788
by King himself, was followed in this little off-shoot from the
parent colony. Governor Bowen's Civil Establishment consisted of
three persons, including himself. His subordinates were Dr. Jacob
Mountgarret, Surgeon of the <i>Glatton</i>, as Medical Officer,
and Mr. Wilson as Storekeeper. His military force consisted of
one lance-corporal and 7 privates of the New South Wales Corps,
There were 21 male and 3 female convicts. Three free settlers
accompanied the party&mdash;Birt, who took his wife; Clark, a
stonemason; and another whose name is not given, who was made
overseer of convicts. Three other free persons, a man and two
women, also obtained leave to try their fortunes in the new
settlement. Thus the whole colony consisted of 49 persons, of
whom 13 were women and children. They took about six months'
provisions and some live stock&mdash;viz., 10 head of cattle and
about 50 sheep&mdash;while the Governor had the only horse, and
the settlers a few goats, pigs, and fowls.</p>
<p>The <i>Albion</i> and <i>Lady Nelson</i> put to sea on the
31st August; but Governor Bowen was invariably unlucky at sea,
and on the second day of their voyage they encountered a heavy
gale, which obliged the <i>Albion</i> to heave-to, and cost them
heavy losses among the live-stock. Then it fell calm, for which,
however, Captain Bunker found consolation by catching three sperm
whales. The <i>Albion</i> had a reputation for fast
sailing&mdash;having made the passage from Spithead to Port
Jackson in the then unprecedented time of 108 days&mdash;but,
baffled by light unfavourable winds, she did not make Storm Bay
until the tenth day out. Even then she was two days beating up
the river against head winds, so that it was not until Sunday,
the 12th September, 1803, that, passing along the lonely and
thickly wooded banks of the Derwent, the <i>Albion</i>, with the
first Governor of Tasmania on board, came to an anchor in Risdon
Cove. Here they found the <i>Lady Nelson</i> already lying at
anchor, having arrived five days before, on the 7th
September.</p>
<p>I have searched in vain hitherto in printed accounts for the
correct date of Bowen's settlement. The dates given vary from
June to August, but I think we may henceforth consider it
settled, on the authority of official documents, that the
birthday of Tasmania was Tuesday, the 7th day of September,
1803.</p>
<p>Here I must pause. On a future occasion I hope to be able to
draw further on the store of material which has been provided by
the wise liberality of the Government, and to give some
particulars of the history of Bowen's abortive colony at Risdon,
and of Collins' settlement at Sullivan's Cove.</p>

<p><small>SIR</small>,<br>
<br>
You will be surprised to see a vessel so soon after you. You know
my intention of sending a vessel to the southward to fix on a
place for a Settlement, but this has been hastened by a report
communicated to me soon after your departure&mdash;"that the
French intended to settle in Storm Bay Passage, somewhere about
what is now called Frederick Hendrick Bay, and that it was
recommended by you to the Republic", as a proof of which a chart
pointing out the situation (Baye du Nord) was, as Colonel
Paterson informs me, given him a short time before you sailed by
a gentleman of your ship.</p>
<p>You will easily imagine that if any information of that kind
had reached me before your departure I should have requested an
explanation; but, as I knew nothing of it, and at present totally
disbelieving anything of the kind ever being thought of, I
consider it but proper to give you this information. In case the
<i>Cumberland</i> should fall in with your ships, the Commander
of that vessel has my -directions to communicate to you the
orders he is under.</p>
<p>Myself and family join in the kindest good wishes for your
health, and shall long remember the pleasure we enjoyed in your
society. We request you will offer our good wishes to Captain
Hamelin and all your officers.</p>

<h3>THE ENGLISH AT THE DERWENT,<br>
AND THE RISDON SETTLEMENT.</h3>
<p align="center"><small>BY JAMES BACKHOUSE WALKER.<br>
<br>
(Read 14th October, 1880.)</small><br>
<br>

<h4>I. THE ENGLISH AT THE DERWENT.</h4>
<p><small>IN</small> a paper which I had the honour to read
before the Royal Society last November, entitled "The French in
Van Diemen's Land", I endeavoured to show how the discoveries of
the French at the Derwent, and their supposed design of
occupation, influenced Governor King's mind, and led him to
despatch the first English colony to these shores. That paper
brought the story to the 12th September, 1803, when the
<i>Albion</i> whaler, with Governor Bowen on board, cast anchor
in Risdon Cove, five days after the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, which had
brought the rest of his small establishment.</p>
<p>The choice of such an unsuitable place as Risdon for the site
of the first settlement has always been something of a puzzle;
and, in order to understand the circumstances which led to this
ill-advised selection, it will be necessary to go back some
years, and follow the history of English discovery and
exploration in the south of Tasmania.</p>
<p>I have already noticed the elaborate and complete surveys of
the Canal D'Entrecasteaux, and the Rivi&egrave;re du Nord, made
by the French navigators in 1792, and again in 1802; but it must
be remembered that the results of these expeditions were long
kept a profound secret, not only from the English, but from the
world in general. Contemporaneously with the French, English
navigators had been making independent discoveries and surveys in
Southern Tasmania; and it was solely the knowledge thus acquired
that guided Governor King when he instructed Bowen "to fix on a
proper place about Risdon's Cove" for the new settlement.</p>
<p>The English discoverer of the Derwent&mdash;a navigator who,
though less fortunate than Admiral D'Entrecasteaux, yet merits
the title of original discoverer equally with the illustrious
Frenchman&mdash;was Lieutenant John Hayes, of the Bombay Marine,
to whom I have already alluded. The occasion of Hayes' expedition
is sufficiently curious to justify a few words of remark. It was
the only exploring expedition ever sent out by the East India
Company into Australian waters. In those days the great Company
was at the height of its power. Its royal charter secured it an
absolute monopoly of trade, not only with India and China, but
with the entire East, including the whole of the Pacific Ocean.
So exclusive were its privileges, and so jealously maintained,
that the colonists of New South Wales could not trade with the
home country except by permission of the Company. So late as the
year 1806 * it successfully resisted the sale in England of the
first cargo of whale-oil and sealskins shipped by a Sydney firm
in the Lady Barlow, on the ground that the charter of the colony
gave the colonists no right to trade, and that the transaction
was a violation of the Company's charter and against its welfare.
It was urged on behalf of the Court of Directors that such
"piratical enterprises" as the venture of the owners of the Lady
Barlow must at once be put a stop to, as "the inevitable
consequence of building ships in New South Wales will be an
intercourse with all the ports of the China and India Seas, and a
population of European descent, reared in a climate suited to
maintain the energies of the European character, when it becomes
numerous, active, and opulent, may be expected to acquire the
ascendancy in the Indian Seas." The Lords Commissioners of Trade
decided that the action of the colonists was irregular in respect
to the Company's charter. Sir Joseph Banks exerted himself
strenuously on behalf of the colonists, and represented to the
Court of Directors that the Lords Commissioners in future cases
"are disposed to admit the cargo to entry, in case the Court of
Directors see no objection to this measure of indulgence towards
an infant and improving colony," and, further, that their
Lordships intend, without delay, "to prepare instructions for the
future government of the shipping concerns of the colony, on a
plan suited to provide the inhabitants with the means of becoming
less and less burdensome to the mother country, and framed in
such a manner as to interfere as little as possible with the
trade prerogatives and resources of the East India Company." It
was mainly owing to Banks' diplomacy and energy that an Order of
Council was obtained allowing future cargoes from Sydney to be
landed and sold in England.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Pamphlet containing a summary of the
contents of the Brabourne Papers, Sydney, 1886, p. 11.]</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, not surprising that the Company should have
contributed so little towards the exploration of regions which it
held to be an appanage to its Indian dominions, for at that time
the Southern Seas offered few or no temptations of profit to a
great trading corporation. As to New Holland, and Van Diemen's
Land, its supposed southern extension, they were merely obstacles
in the way of the lucrative China trade&mdash;jutting out
inconveniently into the South Sea, lengthening the voyage and
increasing its dangers. For the sake of the vessels employed in
this trade, a knowledge of the Australian coast and its harbours
was desirable.** It was probably with the object of finding a
convenient harbour of refuge for ships following the southern
route to China in their passage round the stormy South Cape of
the Australian continent, that, in the year 1793, the Company
fitted out an expedition destined for Van Diemen's Land. Cook and
Bligh had recently brought home reports which encouraged the idea
that a suitable port might be found there, and it is quite
possible that rumours of the visit of D'Entrecasteaux the year
before had stimulated the Board of Directors to action.</p>
<p class="foot">[** It was considered a chief object of every
exploring expedition to find harbours suitable for the East India
Company's ships. When Flinders was about to sail in the
<i>Investigator</i> to explore the Australian coast, the Court of
Directors, on being "applied to, made him an allowance of
&pound;1200 as "batta money"&mdash;a practical recognition of
their interest in his expedition.&mdash;Brabourne Pamphlet, p.
13.]</p>
<p>Lieutenant John Hayes was appointed to the command of the
expedition, which consisted of two ships, the <i>Duke of
Clarence</i> and the <i>Duchess</i>, and was despatched from
India to explore the coasts of Van Diemen's Land and its
harbours, and to make its way back to India by the South Sea
Islands and the Malay Archipelago. This service Lieut. Hayes
performed in a very satisfactory manner. He surveyed the coasts
of Tasmania, parts of New Caledonia, of New Guinea and other
islands, his voyage extending over two or three years. Unhappily,
the results of these valuable surveys were lost to his employers
and to England, for the ship taking home his charts and journals
was captured by a French man-of-war, all his papers were taken to
Paris and have never since seen the light.* A rough sketch of the
Derwent made by Hayes found its way to Sydney, and is frequently
referred to by Flinders in the account of his voyage. This is all
we know of his exploration of Tasmania, and of the Honourable
East India Company's first, last, and only discovery expedition
to Australian waters.</p>

<br>
<p class="foot">[* There is good reason to believe that Hayes'
charts and journals are in the National Library in Paris, or,
possibly, in the Department of Marine and Colonies. It would be
well if an effort were made to discover them and have them
published. See Appendix.]</p>
<p>Lieut. Hayes' ships reached Storm Bay in the year 1794. He had
heard of the visit of the French to these shores two years
before, but knew nothing of what D'Entrecasteaux had done. He
explored and surveyed the approaches of the Derwent, and sailed
up that river nearly as far as Bridgewater; while, in the belief
that he was making an original discovery, he gave new names to
various localities. These have in some instances superseded those
bestowed by his predecessor D'Entrecasteaux. Thus it is to Hayes
that we owe the name of the Derwent, which has replaced the
French appellation of the Rivi&egrave;re du Nord, and
D'Entrecasteaux Channel was long known to the English by the name
of Storm Bay Passage, which it bears on Hayes' chart. Other names
which are still remembered are Betsey's Island, Prince of Wales
Bay, Mount Direction, and, lastly, Risdon Cove.** It is said that
Risdon Cove and River were named by him after one of the officers
of the ship, but this I have not been able to verify.***</p>
<p class="foot">[** Adamson's Peak, Mount Lewis, Cornelian Bay,
Taylor's Bay, Court's Island, Fluted Cape, Ralph's Bay, were also
named by Hayes.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Mr. Justin Browne informs me that Risdon is
a name borne by a county family of Devonshire; (see "Marshall's
Genealogist's Guide", p. 524), and that it occurs also as a place
name in Gloucestershire, (see also Burke's Armoury, Ed. 18.) The
popular derivation from, a supposed "Rest-down" may, perhaps, be
credited to the fancy of the enterprising and pugnacious printer,
Andrew Bent. So far as I have been able to discover, it first
occurs in "Bent's Tasmanian Almanac" for 1827. It has been copied
by West and other writers.]</p>
<p>It was in the early spring of the year 1798 that Governor
Hunter gave to Flinders&mdash;then a young Lieutenant of H.M.S.
<i>Reliance</i>&mdash;the <i>Norfolk</i>**** a little colonial
sloop of 25 tons, to try to solve the vexed question of the
existence of a strait between New Holland and Van Diemen's Land.
Flinders secured Dr. George Bass as his companion in the
expedition, and on the 7th October, 1798, the <i>Norfolk</i>
sailed from Port Jackson with a crew of 8 volunteers, taking
twelve weeks' provisions. . They examined the North Coast of
Tasmania, entering Port Dalrymple, and sailed for the first time
through the Straits, to which, at Flinders' request, Governor
Hunter gave the name of Bass' Straits.*****</p>
<p class="foot">[**** The <i>Norfolk</i>, which has the credit of
having first circumnavigated Van Diemen's Land, was built at
Norfolk Island, of the pine for which that island is celebrated.
She was afterwards used by Flinders in his exploration of Moreton
Bay. Labilliere's Early History of Victoria. Vol. i., p. 26.]</p>
<p class="foot">[***** "No more than a just tribute", says the
generous Flinders, "to my worthy friend and companion for the
extreme dangers and fatigues he has undergone in first entering
it in the whale-boat, and to the correct judgment he had formed
from various indications of the existence of a wide opening
between Van Diemen's Land and New South Wales."&mdash;Voyage to
Terra Australis, Intro., p. 193.]</p>
<p>Leaving Bass' Straits the <i>Norfolk</i> sailed southwards
along the West Coast&mdash;Flinders naming Mount Heemskirk and
Mount Zeehan after Tasman's two vessels&mdash;and on 14th
December, arrived at the entrance of Storm Bay. Flinders had with
him a copy of Hayes' sketch chart of the Derwent, but had never
even heard of D'Entrecasteaux's discoveries six years before.
Bass, in speaking of Adventure Bay, says&mdash;"This island, the
Derwent, and Storm Bay Passage were the discovery of Mr. Hayes,
of which he made a chart." More than a fortnight was employed by
Flinders in making a careful survey of Norfolk Bay, and of the
Derwent from the Iron Pot to a point some 5 miles above
Bridgewater. In the Introduction to his <i>Voyage to Terra
Australis</i>, he gives the result of his observations. Bass
devoted his attention more particularly to an examination of the
neighbouring country, its soil, productions, and suitableness for
agriculture. He took long excursions into the country, having
seldom other society than his two dogs, examining in this way the
western shore of the river from below the Blow Hole at Brown's
River to beyond Prince of Wales Bay, visiting various parts of
the eastern shore, and ascending Mount Wellington and Mount
Direction. His original journal has never come to light, but the
substance of it was published in 1802, by Collins, in the second
volume of his <i>Account of New South Wales</i>.</p>
<p>It is interesting to learn how the country with which we are
so familiar struck the first visitor to its shores, when as yet
the land was in all its native wildness, and untouched by the
hand of man, and I shall therefore give some of Bass's
observations on the country about the Derwent. The explorers had
some difficulty in getting the <i>Norfolk</i> as far up the river
as the mouth of the Jordan, which Flinders named Herdsman's Cove.
Thence they proceeded in their boat some 5 or 6 miles higher up.
They expected to have been able to reach the source in one tide,
but in this they were mistaken, falling, as they believed, some
miles short of it. I regret to say that Bass did not show the
good taste of the Frenchmen who were so enthusiastic on the
grandeur and beauty of the harbours and rivers which they had
entered. He describes our noble river as a "dull, lifeless
stream, which after a sleepy course of not more than 25 or 27
miles to the north-west, falls into Frederick Henry Bay. Its
breadth there is two miles and a quarter, and its depth ten
fathoms." He further remarks, "If the Derwent River has any claim
to respectability, it is indebted for it more to the paucity of
inlets into Van Diemen's Land than to any intrinsic merits of its
own." Yet his impression of the country on its banks was
distinctly favourable. "The river", he says "takes its way
through a country that on the east and north sides is hilly, on
the west and north mountainous. The hills, to the eastward arise
immediately from the banks; but the mountains to the westward
have retired to the distance of a few miles from the water, and
have left in their front hilly land similar to that on the east
side. All the hills are very thinly set with light timber,
chiefly short she-oaks, but are admirably covered with thick
nutritious grass, in general free from brush or patches of
shrubs. The soil in which it grows is a black vegetable mould,
deep only in the valleys, frequently very shallow, with
occasionally a mixture of sand or small stones. Many large tracts
of land appear cultivable both for maize and wheat, but which, as
pasture land, would be excellent. The hills descend with such
gentle slopes, that the valleys between them are extensive and
flat. Several contain an indeterminate depth of rich soil,
capable of supporting the most exhausting vegetation, and are
tolerably well watered by chains of small ponds, or occasional
drains, which empty themselves into the river by a cove or
creek." Black swans were seen in great numbers, and kangaroo
abounded, but Bass came to the conclusion that the natives must
be few in number, as although they frequently found their rude
huts and deserted fires, during a fortnights' excursions they
fell in with none of the aborigines, except a man and two women,
with whom they had a friendly interview some miles above
Herdsman's Cove. Bass contrasts New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land in respect of their fitness for agriculture: his opinion was
that they were both poor countries, but in point of productive
soil the preference was to be given to Van Diemen's Land. He
founds on the banks of the Derwent various tracts of land which
he considered admirably adapted for grain, for vines, and for
pasturage, and no place combined so many advantages as Risdon
Cove. Bass grows almost enthusiastic in describing Risdon. "The
land at the head of Risdon Creek, on the east side," he remarks,
"seems preferable to any other on the banks of the Derwent. The
creek runs winding between two steep hills, and ends in a chain
of ponds that extend into a fertile valley of great beauty. For
half-a-mile above the head of the creek the valley is contracted
and narrow, but the soil is extremely rich, and the fields are
well covered with grass. Beyond this it suddenly expands and
becomes broad and flat at the bottom, whence arise long grassy
slopes, that by a gentle but increasing ascent continue to mount
the hills on each side, until they are hidden from the view by
woods of large timber which overhang their summits The soil along
the bottom, and to some distance up the slopes, is a rich
vegetable mould, apparently hardened by a small mixture of clay,
which grows a large quantity of thick juicy grass and some few
patches of close underwood."</p>
<p>Flinders was, however, disappointed with Hayes' Risdon River,
and notices the insignificance of the little creek, which even
his boat could not enter, and at which he could barely manage to
fill his water casks. Among "the many local advantages of the
Derwent" to which King alludes in his despatches to Lord Hobart,
and which determined him to choose that place for a settlement,
there is no doubt that Bass's glowing description of the beauty
and fertility of Risdon filled a large place, and induced him to
direct Bowen to choose its neighbourhood for the new colony.</p>

<h4>II. THE RISDON SETTLEMENT.</h4>
<p>It is now time for us to return to Lieut. Bowen and his little
colony, whom we left on the 12th September, 1803, in the
<i>Albion</i> and <i>Lady Nelson</i> at anchor in Risdon Cove. A
week later Bowen writes to Governor King by the <i>Albion</i>,
reporting his arrival, and his definite selection of Risdon as
the site of the new settlement. He seems to have accepted Risdon
as a foregone conclusion, for although he tells the Governor that
he had explored the river to a point rather higher than Flinders
went, it does not appear that he made any sufficient examination
of the western bank. If he had done so he could hardly have
written to King&mdash;"There are so many fine spots on the
borders of the river that I was a little puzzled to fix upon the
best place; but there being a much better stream of fresh water
falling into Risdon Cove than into any of the others, and very
extensive valleys lying at the back of it, I judged it the most
convenient, and accordingly disembarked all the men and stores."
He could never have written thus if he had examined either
Humphrey's Rivulet or the stream falling into Sullivan's Cove.
Bowen's choice of Risdon does not lead us to form a high opinion
of his qualifications as the founder of a new colony. On the
other hand, it is only fair to take into account his
difficulties. Doubtless, he felt himself in a great degree bound
by the instructions he had received from Governor King to fix on
a spot in the neighbourhood of Risdon Cove. He also knew that
Bass had carefully examined both shores of the river and had
found no place so eligible. Moreover, it would be unjust to judge
his choice by our present knowledge. Every settlement in an
unknown and thickly wooded country must be more or less
tentative, and the objections to the locality were not so evident
in its original state as they now are. At present the Cove is
silted up in consequence of a causeway having been built across
it, but when Bowen entered it it was a fairly deep and commodious
harbour. There was much to recommend the site to a new-comer.
When the <i>Albion</i> sailed up the Derwent the best valleys
running down to the river were full of a dense scrub, most
discouraging to a settler, and at that period Risdon probably
presented the most open land on this side Herdsman's Cove. It was
early spring, and at that season there would be a good stream of
water in the creek, the open land of the Risdon valley was
covered with rich and luxuriant grass, and higher up the creek
was a fair amount of the good agricultural land described by
Bass. The unsuitability of the valley as a site for a large town
would never occur to Bowen, who was content if he could find for
his handful of settlers a sufficient space for their gardens, and
a few cornfields to supply their immediate requirements. The
small scale of the establishment with which he was entrusted
would inevitably limit his ideas. Still, after every allowance
has been made, it remains evident that Lieut. John Bowen was not
one of the men who are born to be the successful founders of new
States.</p>
<p>The site of this first settlement is on the farm so well known
as the home of the late Mr. Thos. Geo. Gregson, M.H.A. It lies
about two miles from the landing-place of the Risdon ferry. A
stone causeway crosses the cove not far from the mouth of the
creek. For some 100 or 150 yards before the little stream falls
into the cove it finds its way through a small marsh of some 20
acres, shut in on each side by steep hills. In Bowen's time this
stream was fresh and clear-flowing; now it is brackish, sluggish,
and muddy, choked with weeds and slime, and altogether uninviting
in aspect. At the upper end of the marsh, where the valley
suddenly contracts, a dilapidated stone jetty marks the old
landing-place on the creek, at present quite inaccessible for a
boat. On the narrow strip of flat ground between the jetty and
the steep hill beyond are the barely discernible foundations of a
stone building, the first stone store in Tasmania. From this
point a road leads upwards along the hillside for some 150 or 200
yards to the top of the rise, where there is a level piece of
land of no great extent, bounded on the north by rough hills, and
on the south sloping steeply to the valley. On the edge of this
level ground, overlooking the flat, and commanding a fine view of
the Derwent and of the mountains behind it, stand some
dilapidated wooden buildings, for many years well known as the
residence of Mr. Gregson, the little cottage in front being, not
improbably, Lieut. Bowen's original quarters. A good garden
extends to the rear of the house, and in this garden, about 100
yards behind the cottage, there still stand the ruins of an oven
with brick chimney, which Mr. Gregson for many years religiously
preserved as the remains of the first house erected in Van
Diemen's Land. From this point the valley is narrow, the ground
sloping down steeply, but there is good agricultural land in the
bottom, and on the northern slope where Bowen's free settlers
were located&mdash;the other side being stony and barren. A plan
which Bowen sent to Governor King enables us to identify the
locality with absolute precision. He tells King&mdash;"We are
situated on a hill commanding a perfect view of the river, and
with the fresh water at the foot of it&mdash;the land
excellent."</p>
<p>After pitching his tents at Risdon, Bowen was not idle. He set
his people at once to work to build huts. During the first week
he made a boat excursion up the river; examined Herdsman's Cove,
and thought of locating his free settlers there. He describes the
Derwent as "perfectly fresh" above Herdsman's Cove, and "the
banks more like a nobleman's park in England than an uncultivated
country; every part is beautifully green, and very little trouble
might clear every valley I have seen in a month. There are few
rocky spots except on the high hills, and in many places the
plough might be used immediately; but our workmen are very few
and very bad. I could with ease employ a hundred men upon the
land about us, and with that number&mdash;some good men among
them&mdash;we should soon be a flourishing colony." Next week he
made another trip up the Derwent, but without further results. He
sends King a plan of his settlement,* and already within a
fortnight of his arrival he had got quarters built for his
soldiers and prisoners, had located his free settlers on their
five-acre allotments up the valley about a quarter of a mile from
his tent, and had Clark, the stonemason, at work building a stone
store.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Appendix.]</p>
<p>He had&mdash;probably in accordance with King's
instructions&mdash;named the new settlement "Hobart",** after
Lord Hobart, the Secretary of State for the Colonies.</p>
<p class="foot">[** "Town" was not added to the name until some
time after the settlement was removed by Collins to Sullivan's
Cove.]</p>

<small>Sketch of Bowen's First Settlement at Risdon Cove,
1803.<br>
["The Risdon Settlement"]</small></p>
<br>
<p>His Returns, dated "Hobart, Van Diemen's Land, 27th September,
1803", show an effective strength of 22 men&mdash;21 convicts and
their overseer&mdash;of whom 2 were in charge of stock, 4
employed on buildings, (viz., a blacksmith, carpenter, and two
sawyers), the bulk of the convicts forming a town gang. The three
women are returned as "cutting grass", probably for thatching. Of
the stock, the Government owned 9 cattle and 25 sheep, the
Commandant had a mare, and the Doctor a cow, while the Officers
and Birt and Clarke, the free settlers, were possessors of 7
sheep, 8 goats, and 38 swine.</p>
<p>Within a fortnight from his landing, as I have said, Bowen had
all his people housed, and reports to King that the soldiers and
prisoners have got very comfortable huts. He fixed his own
quarters on the spot where Mr. Gregson's house now stands; the
soldiers' huts were a little behind Dr. Mountgarret's quarters,
and the prisoners' huts were placed on the brow of the steep bank
overlooking the creek. (See plan). The Commandant tells King that
he has not yet drawn any lines for the town, waiting till he can
cut down the large timber which obstructed his view. To lay out a
town in such a situation must have been a difficult problem; for
his little settlement was perched on the top of a high almost
precipitous bank, on the edge of a very narrow gully, and the
narrow plateau on which it stood, shut in at the back by rough
hills, did not afford room for a fair-sized village. But the
difficulties of the locality were as nothing to the difficulties
of the human material out of which he had to form his colony.</p>
<p>The soldiers of the New South Wales Corps, who formed his
guard, and on whom he had to depend for the maintenance of order,
were discontented, almost mutinous. Within a week of his arrival
they were grumbling at the hard duty of mounting one sentry
during the day and two at night. The Commandant thought they had
been spoilt by too easy a life in Sydney, and begged the Governor
to send him down an active officer or sergeant who would keep
them to their duty.</p>
<p>As to the prisoners, they were of the worst class,
ill-behaved, useless, and lazy. Indeed, when we find that some of
the worst offenders in New South Wales had been sentenced by the
Criminal Court in Sydney to serve a certain number of years at
Risdon Creek, we cannot wonder at Bowen's complaints of their
conduct, nor can we be surprised that he was able to effect so
little.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Governor King did not forget the interests of the
new colony. In his reply to Bowen's first letters, he expressed
himself as well pleased with the selection of Risdon, and with
the progress that had been made with the settlement. He also
promised the reinforcements for which Bowen asked, and,
accordingly, towards the end of October the <i>Dart</i> brig was
despatched to the Derwent. She took 42 prisoners&mdash;of whom 20
were volunteers&mdash;and these latter were told that, if their
behaviour was good, they should be allowed, at the end of two
years, to choose between settling at the Derwent and returning to
Sydney. The Governor also strengthened the Military force by
sending down 15 soldiers under the command of Lieut. Moore. He
strongly urged Bowen to leave their discipline entirely to their
officer, to give them good huts, full rations, a plot of ground
for a garden, and to employ them on military duty only, so that
they might have no just ground for complaint. The <i>Dart</i>
took six months' supplies of pork and flour for the new arrivals,
and also two carronades which had belonged to the
<i>Investigator</i>, and as to the care of which King gave the
Commandant very special cautions. No more free settlers were
sent, as the Governor wished first to get a better knowledge of
the country and of its suitableness for agriculture. To this end
he sent down James Meehan, a surveyor who had done good work in
New South Wales under Surveyor-General Grimes, and had recently
formed one of the party who had made the survey of Port Philip in
the <i>Cumberland</i>. Meehan was to be employed in surveying and
making observations on the soil and natural productions of the
colony, and was to advise with respect to the distribution of the
town, church, and school lands, fortification, court-house,
settlers' allotments, and government grounds for the purpose of
agriculture and grazing. He remained some four months at Hobart,
returning to Sydney in March, 1804, after having completed the
first surveys in Tasmania. Flinders' map shows that Meehan
explored from the Coal River in a north-east direction, returning
by way of Prosser's Plains and the Sorell District, but we have
no particulars of the result of his observations.</p>
<p>Bowen's little colony now numbered something like 100 souls.
It had been established about two months, and might fairly have
been expected to have made at least a start towards definite
progress. But it was pre-destined to failure. The few meagre
facts that can be gleaned from the Record Office papers show that
matters went most persistently wrong. The Commandant may not have
been to blame for this ill success&mdash;possibly no man could
have achieved success with the like material. The first arrivals
had been bad, the second batch was certainly no better. We have
Collins' testimony, very emphatically given, that many of them
were "abandoned, hardened wretches"&mdash;more atrocious than
those imported from the gaols of England." The story of the
escape of seven of these convicts, under the leadership of one
Duce, gives us an idea of their lawlessness, their ignorance, and
their utter recklessness. One night, Duce and his six companions
stole the Commandant's boat as she lay in the cove, gained
possession of two guns, and got away down the river. Some of the
party wanted, without compass or provisions, to run for New
Zealand, which they thought could easily be done. Others, not
quite so ignorant, preferred to try to make Timor. Violent
quarrels ensued, but they kept on their course along the east
coast, living on fish and such vegetable food as they could
collect on the shore, and constantly on the verge of murderous
conflict, until they reached Bass Strait. Here one of the party
was left on a desolate rock, Duce threatening to shoot any one
who interfered. The rest made Cape Barren Island, where they fell
in with a sealing party. Duce and three others designed to seize
the vessel, but were betrayed by their companions. The sealers
overpowered them, and put the four, with some provisions, on one
of the islands, where they left them. Whether they perished, or
whether they helped to swell the number of lawless runaways who
for so long a time infested the islands in the Straits, no one
knows.</p>
<p>The soldiers were almost as great a trouble to the Commandant
as the convicts. They were always discontented, occasionally
mutinous. At times, instead of guarding the stores from
depredation, they connived at the prisoners plundering them. An
occasion of this sort, when a soldier was proved to have been
accomplice in a robbery, led to Bowen taking a very extraordinary
step. He could not try the man, not being able to constitute a
court-martial, and was so puzzled to know what to do with him,
that when the <i>Ferret</i> whaler chanced to put into the
Derwent, he actually determined to leave his post, and himself
take the culprit to Sydney for trial. Accordingly, he sailed from
Risdon for Sydney in the <i>Ferret</i>, on the 9th January,
1804.</p>
<p>With all these signs of the utter disorganisation of the
settlement, we cannot wonder that no progress had been made, and
that when Collins arrived a few weeks later, he found that after
five months' residence not a single acre of land was in
preparation for grain upon Government account.</p>
<p>But the Risdon settlement was already doomed, owing to a
series of events of which neither Governor King nor his
Commandant was yet aware. Before Bowen had made his first
abortive start for the Derwent, and before Governor King's
despatch of 23rd November, 1802, respecting French designs, could
have reached England the Home Government had taken a resolution
which&mdash;not by any intention of theirs&mdash;was destined to
bring Lieut. Bowen's colony to an end, by its extinction in a
more systematic and extensive settlement on the banks of the
Derwent. In January, 1803, an Order in Council appointed
Lieut.-Colonel David Collins, of the Royal Marines,
Lieutenant-Governor of a settlement intended to be formed at Port
Phillip, in New South Wales. The new establishment sailed from
Spithead on the 24th April, 1803&mdash;a month before King had
given Bowen his commission as Commandant of Hobart&mdash;had just
left Cape Town when Bowen sailed from Sydney in the
<i>Albion</i>, and arrived in Port Phillip on the 9th October,
1803.</p>
<p>This is not the place to give an account of Collins'
proceedings, at Port Phillip or elsewhere, except in so far as
they affected the fortunes of the Risdon settlement. Suffice it
to say, that Collins found, or fancied, that Port Phillip was
unfit for a settlement, and after corresponding with Governor
King, and dawdling near the Heads for some three months, he
finally decided to remove his establishment to the Derwent.
Thereupon, King sent Collins a letter addressed to Bowen,
directing the latter to hand over to Collins his command at the
Derwent, and to send back to Port Jackson his detachment of the
New South Wales Corps. And so a game of cross purposes began. For
while Collins was still fuming and fidgetting at Port Phillip,
balancing the comparative advantages of Port Dalrymple and the
Derwent, and gradually making up his mind in favour of the latter
place, Bowen had sailed from Risdon in the <i>Ferret</i> with his
burglarious soldier, and had presented himself to the astonished
Governor King at Port Jackson. The Governor seems to have taken
no pains to conceal the annoyance he felt at his Commandant
leaving his post on so trifling an occasion, and sarcastically
remarks in a despatch to Lord Hobart, that Bowen's "return was
occasioned by the necessity he conceived himself to be under of
bringing up a soldier who had been implicated with the rest in
robbing the stores." He was the more vexed at this inopportune
return, as he knew that Collins was on the point of leaving Port
Phillip, and he was particularly anxious that the Risdon
Commandant should be at hand to give the new Lieutenant-Governor
the benefit of his experience and knowledge of the locality.</p>
<p>The colonial cutter <i>Integrity</i> had just been launched.
She was hastily fitted for sea, and Bowen was ordered to return
in her to the Derwent forthwith, calling at Port Phillip to join
Collins, to give him all necessary assistance, and accompany him
to Risdon. The <i>Integrity</i> sailed on the 5th February; but
Bowen's ill luck still attended him. When he reached Port Phillip
he found only a remnant of Collins' establishment, under the
charge of Lieut. Sladden, the Lieutenant-Governor himself having
sailed for the Derwent in the <i>Ocean</i> with the bulk of his
people two or three days before. Bowen accordingly hastened on
with his despatches, but shortly after sailing the cutter's
rudder fastenings carried away, and she was placed in a very
dangerous position. However, she managed to reach Kent's Bay,
Cape Barren Island, and there they found a sealing party
belonging to the American ships <i>Pilgrim</i> and
<i>Perseverance</i>. The necessity for getting on was imperative;
so Bowen made a verbal agreement with the American skipper,
Captain Amasa Delano, to carry them on in his ship, and
afterwards, if required, to proceed to Port Jackson. From the
diary of the Chaplain of Collins' party, the well known Rev.
Robert Knopwood, we learn that the <i>Pilgrim</i> cast anchor in
Sullivan's Cove on 10th March, and that at six in the evening, a
boat brought ashore "the Governor of Risdon Creek, Lieut. Bowen,
of the Royal Navy."</p>
<p>It must have proved a considerable mortification to the
Governor of Risdon Creek to learn the events that had occurred
during his unlucky absence. Lieutenant-Governor Collins had
arrived in the evening of the 15th February, and next morning had
landed at the Risdon settlement under a salute of 11 guns from
the <i>Ocean</i>. On landing, he had been received by the officer
in charge, Lieut. Moore, of the New South Wales' Corps, and the
rest of the establishment&mdash;consisting of the doctor,
storekeeper, and military force of 16 privates, one sergeant, and
one drum and fife. After examining the camp, gardens, water,
&amp;c., the new Lieutenant-Governor had at once come to the
conclusion&mdash;which, indeed, was pretty evident&mdash;that
Risdon was not, in the Chaplain's words, "calculated for a town".
Accordingly, on the following day, the Governor, with the
Chaplain and Wm. Collins, had gone exploring, and had returned
much delighted, having found, at a place on the opposite side of
the river, six miles below Risdon, "a plain well calculated in
every degree for a settlement." Forthwith the tents of the new
establishment had been struck and taken on board the ships, which
had dropped down the river to the selected spot, and anchored in
Sullivan's Cove. So that on the 20th February&mdash;five days
after Collins' arrival&mdash;his tents had been pitched at the
mouth of the creek on the present site of Hobart, and the glory
of Risdon had departed.</p>
<p>Bowen's settlement had had its own internal troubles, which,
no doubt, Lieut. Moore duly reported to the Governor of Risdon
Creek. On the 21st February, the day after the founding of the
new Hobart at Sullivan's Cove, a further batch of five convicts
had escaped from Risdon, having found means to steal half a
barrel of gunpowder from under the very feet of the sentry, and
also two "musquets", with which they had got off into the woods.
The runaways, however, did not find the woods inviting enough for
a permanent residence, and one of them having voluntarily come
in, the others followed his example next day, bringing the arms
and ammunition with them. It was too troublesome and expensive to
send them to Sydney for trial; they were, therefore, heavily
ironed, and kept to work as a gaol gang.</p>
<p>The only consolation that the Risdon Governor could have found
in his adversity&mdash;besides the greater opportunities of good
fellowship which were now afforded him, with, no doubt, better
fare than the salt pork and bread, which had hitherto been the
regulation diet&mdash;was the consideration that the religious
wants of his people, about which Governor King had been so
emphatic, were now under proper regulation, and that on Sundays,
when the weather was not unfavourable, the Chaplain, after divine
service at Sullivan's Cove, had occasionally gone over to Risdon
in the afternoon, and, as he phrases it, "done his duty to all
the convicts, &amp;c., &amp;c.", dining afterwards with Dr.
Mountgarret.</p>
<p>Captain Delano, meanwhile, was making a good thing out of
Bowen's misfortunes. The <i>Integrity</i> was still lying at Cape
Barren Island, disabled, and she had to be brought on. So, after
enjoying and returning the hospitalities of the place for a
fortnight, the American captain sailed again for the Straits,
with new rudder fastenings for the disabled vessel, and in less
than a month the <i>Pilgrim</i> once more appeared in the Derwent
[17th April] with the <i>Integrity</i> in company. The
<i>Pilgrim</i> sailed away a few days later to continue her
sealing voyage, and her captain carried with him not only the
reward of an approving conscience, but also Bowen's bill on
Governor King for &pound;400. When the bill was presented in the
following August, King's surprise was considerable, and he made
some vigorous protests. But the bill was in due form, for
services performed, and the Governor had to pay. He could only
relieve his feelings by writing to Lord Hobart in strong terms as
to the American's conduct; but he says, "I did not consider I
could, with that respect due to the British character, either
curtail or refuse payment of the bill, notwithstanding the
extortionate advantage that had been taken of Mr. Bowen's
necessities, and his not entering into a written agreement."</p>
<p>We hear again of Captain Delano and his party a month or two
later, and they seem to have been very undesirable visitors. Not
only had they been smuggling spirits against the stringent
regulations, and decoying prisoners, but they had made themselves
still more obnoxious by their brutal treatment of a sealing party
at Kent's Bay belonging to the <i>Surprise</i> sloop, of Sydney.
According to the statement of the master of the <i>Surprise</i>,
he had been flogged and nearly killed by Delano's men for
venturing to come into the Straits and interfere with them by
killing seals in their neighbourhood. Governor King was inclined
to take vigorous measures to put a stop to the lawless conduct
which was then only too common amongst the American sealers in
Bass' Straits, and proposed to the Home Government that he should
be authorised to go the length of seizing their ships as the only
means of teaching them better behaviour.</p>
<p>But to return to the fortunes of the Risdon Settlement.
Lieutenant-Governor Collins was altogether disappointed with the
condition of Bowen's colony, and made a very unfavourable report
on it to Governor King. The site was quite unsuitable; the
landing-place on the creek was choked with mud, and only
accessible at high tide; the stores were placed on a low
position, and likely to be flooded by any heavy rain; the land
was by no means first class; and the rivulet, on which they
depended for their fresh water, and which in September had been a
running stream, was in February dwindled to a few pools of dirty
water. The indifferent capabilities of the place had not been
made the most of. No grain had been sown, and no Government land
had been even prepared for sowing. Dr. Mountgarret, and Clark and
Birt, the free settlers, had each about five acres ready, but
they had no seed, so Collins had to supply them with sufficient
to crop their land. The five months' occupation had been wasted;
there was nothing to show but a few wretched huts, cottages
somewhat better for the officers, and a few acres of land roughly
cleared of trees and scrub. The people were in a miserable
condition, having been for some time on two-thirds of the
standard rations, so that Collins had to supply them with food,
and even to remove their starving pigs to his own camp to save
their lives. A more dismal failure for a new colony could
scarcely be imagined. It is difficult to decide how far Bowen was
to blame for this wretched state of things. The human material
that had been given him to mould into shape was desperately bad.
Collins says that the officer in charge on his arrival (probably
Lieut. Moore) described them "as a worthless and desperate set of
wretches"; and this language does not appear to have been too
strong. The Sydney authorities seem to have taken the opportunity
of Bowen's settlement to rid themselves of their worst criminals,
including the most turbulent of the United Irishmen, who had
lately given so much trouble by their rising in the older colony.
Even the soldiers of the New South Wales Corps, sent to curb
these undesirable colonists, were lazy and mutinously inclined.
It is a satisfaction to know that Collins eventually shipped the
whole lot back to Sydney:&mdash;both soldiers and convicts, with
but few exceptions&mdash;so that they never had any part in the
new Hobart.</p>
<p>Collins did not interfere with Bowen or with Lieut. Moore in
their command, but left them in uncontrolled charge. Indeed, he
seems to have been only too anxious to wash his hands of Risdon
and all its works. Governor Bowen and the Risdon officers,
however, made the best of their circumstances, and, if we can
trust the chaplain's diary, took life easily&mdash;shooting,
hunting, excursionising, and exchanging frequent visits with the
officers of the new camp. Towards the end of March Mr. Knopwood
goes to Risdon for a few days, and "they caught six young emews
the size of a turkey, and shot the old mother." On Easter Sunday
[1 April], after Divine Service, they all go to the chaplain's
marquee at the camp, and "partook of some Norfolk ham, the best
we ever eat". At 4 <small>P.M</small>. he adjourns to Lieut.
Lord's to dinner, "and was very merry". Mr. Knopwood records many
visits to Risdon, and excursions with Bowen up the river, to
Mount Direction, to Ralph's Bay, and other places. "The Governor
of Risdon Creek", as Knopwood called him, had, however, enough
trouble with his refractory people. His soldiers had long
grumbled at the sentry duty as too hard for their small numbers;
and the discontent at last broke out into direct mutiny. On
Sunday 22nd April, the men flatly refused to mount guard, and
became so insolent and insubordinate that Lieut. Moore promptly
put four of the ringleaders into irons, and took them down to
Sullivan's Cove. Lieut.-Governor Collins sent the mutineers under
a guard on board the Colonial cutter <i>Integrity</i>, then on
the point of sailing for Port Jackson. At the same time a plot
was on foot amongst some of the Irish convicts, at Risdon. Their
object was to seize the storehouse, supply themselves with
provisions, and make good their escape from the settlement. On
the discovery of the plot, three of the ringleaders were
forthwith flogged, and, to prevent further mischief, Captain
Bowen and Mr. Wilson, the storekeeper, a few days later, took the
mutinous prisioners to Norfolk Bay in the Risdon whaleboat.
"Eight of them, and all Irishmen", remarks the chaplain. They
were left on Smooth Island (now known as Garden Island), with a
month's provisions, and Bowen went on to explore the River
Huon.</p>
<p>With that fatality which always kept Bowen out of the way when
he was wanted, an important and disastrous event occurred at
Risdon in his absence. This was the first affray of the English
with the natives. It was on the 3rd May, 1804, that this first of
the long series of fatal encounters between the two races took
place. Up to this time it does not appear that any natives had
been seen in the neighbourhood of Risdon. Knopwood relates that
there had been some friendly intercourse with the tribe on the
other side of the river, and that some of them had come to
Collins' camp. We also learn from him that he and Bowen had seen
many natives in the neighbourhood of Frederick Henry Bay. The
blacks had always shown themselves shy and suspicious, but
relations had hitherto been quite friendly. The unhappy event of
the 3rd May sowed the seeds of a hostility on the part of the
blacks, which, exasperated from time to time by mutual injuries,
filled the colony with deeds of outrage and horror, with savage
murders of innocent settlers, and almost equally savage
retaliation, until the native race was nearly exterminated, and
the miserable remnant removed to Flinders' Island, to perish of
slow decay. Of the origin of the affray the accounts are very
contradictory. Two of these are contemporary; one recorded by Mr.
Knopwood in his diary, the other in a letter by Lieut. Moore, the
officer in charge of Risdon. The Chaplain says, under date
Thursday, 3rd May:&mdash;"At 2 <small>P.M</small>. we heard the
report of cannon once from Risdon. The Lieut.-Governor sent a
message to know the cause. At half-past 7, Lieut. Moore arrived
at the camp to Lieut.-Governor Collins, and I received the
following note from Risdon:&mdash;</p>
<p><small>DEAR SIR</small>,</p>
<p>I beg to refer you to Mr. Moore for the particulars of an
attack the natives made on the camp to-day, and I have every
reason to think it was premeditated, as their number far exceeded
any that we ever heard of. As you express a wish to be acquainted
with some of the natives, if you will dine with me to-morrow, you
will oblige me by christening a fine native boy who I have.
Unfortunately, poor boy, his father and mother were both killed;
he is about 2 years old. I have, likewise, the body of a man that
was killed. If Mr. Bowden wishes to see him dissected, I will be
happy to see him with you to-morrow. I would have wrote to him,
but Mr. Moore waits.</p>
<p align="center">Your friend,</p>
<p align="right"><small>J. MOUNTGARRET</small>.<br>
Hobart, six o'clock.</p>
<p>The number of natives, I think, was not less than 5 or 6
hundred.</p>
<p align="right">J.M."</p>
<p>Knopwood continues:</p>
<p>"At 8, Lieut. Moore came to my marquee, and stayed some time;
he informed me of the natives being very numerous, and that they
had wounded one of the settlers, Burke, and was going to burn his
house down, and ill-treated his wife, &amp;c., &amp;c."</p>
<p>Lieut. Moore's letter&mdash;a copy of which is preserved in
the Record Office&mdash;is dated Risdon Cove, 7th May, 1804, and
is addressed to Governor Collins. He says&mdash;</p>
<p><small>SIR</small>,<br>
<br>
Agreeable to your desire, I have the honour of acquainting you
with the circumstances that led to the attack on the natives,
which you will perceive was the consequence of their own hostile
appearance.</p>
<p>It would appear from the numbers of them, and the spears,
&amp;c., with which they were armed, that their design was to
attack us. However, it was not until they had thoroughly
convinced us of their intentions, by using violence to a
settler's wife, and my own servant&mdash;who was returning into
camp with some kangaroos, one of which they took from
him&mdash;that they were fired upon. On their coming into camp
and surrounding it, I went towards them with five soldiers. Their
appearance and numbers I thought very far from friendly. During
this time I was informed that a party of them was beating Birt,
the settler, at his farm. I then despatched two soldiers to his
assistance, with orders not to fire if they could avoid it.
However, they found it necessary; and one was killed on the spot,
and another found dead in the valley.</p>
<p>But at this time a great party was in the camp; and, on a
proposal from Mr. Mountgarret to fire one of the carronades to
intimidate them, they departed.</p>
<p>Mr. Mountgarret, with some soldiers and prisoners, followed
them some distance up the valley, and have reason to suppose more
was wounded, as one was seen to be taken away bleeding. During
the time they were in camp, a number of old men were perceived at
the foot of the hill, near the valley, employed in preparing
spears.</p>
<p>I have now, Sir, as near as I can recollect, given you the
leading particulars, and hope inhere has nothing been done but
what you approve of.</p>
<p align="center">I have the honour to be, &amp;c.,</p>
<p align="right"><small>WILLIAM MOORE,</small><br>
Lieut. N.S.W. Corps.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that in this letter Lieut. Moore, who had
every reason to represent the conduct of the natives in the worst
light, can show no direct act of hostility. He assumed that they
were hostile, from their numbers; and, for the beating of Birt,
and the proposed burning of his hut, he has no evidence to offer
but a report brought to him in the midst of the panic which the
appearance of the blacks had caused among his people. That the
doctor's proposal to fire the carronade should have induced
savages, who did not understand the language, and had never seen
fire-arms, to withdraw, is too great a stretch on one's
credulity. We know, from Knopwood, that the gun was fired; but,
whether it was loaded with blank cartridge or with grape, we have
no means of deciding.</p>
<p>The only other eye-witness of the affair whose account we have
directly contradicts Lieut. Moore; and his story looks probable,
like the story of a man who had kept his head amidst the general
panic. This witness is one Edward White, who was examined before
Governor Arthur's Aborigines' Committee in 1830. In considering
his evidence, it should be remembered that, at the time he gave
it, the exasperation of the whole colony against the blacks, on
account of their brutal outrages, was at fever heat, and the
witness had every inducement to represent their conduct in this
affair in an unfavourable light. White came to the colony with
Bowen, and was an assigned servant to the settler Clark. He was
the first man who saw the approach of the natives. He was hoeing
new ground on the creek near Clark's house, which was about half
a mile up the valley behind the camp. As he was hoeing, he saw
300 natives, men, women, and children, coming down the valley in
a circular, or, rather, a semi-circular, form, with a flock of
kangaroo between them. They had no spears, but were armed with
waddies only, and were driving the kangaroo into the bottom. On
catching sight of him, they paused, astonished, and, to use his
expression, "looked at him with all their eyes." White had very
probably been accustomed to the Port Jackson natives; at any
rate, he says that he felt no alarm at the approach of the
blacks, but he thought it advisable to go down the creek and
inform some soldiers. He then went back to his work. On his
return the natives were near Clark's house. They did not molest
him or threaten him in any way. Birt's house was on the other
side of the creek, some hundreds of yards off, and White was very
positive that, so far from attacking Birt or his house, they
never even crossed over to that side of the creek, and "were not
within half a quarter of a mile" of the hut. He knew nothing of
their going into the camp itself; but they did not attack the
soldiers, and, he believed, would not have molested them. When
the firing commenced there were a great many of the natives
slaughtered and wounded, how many he did not know.</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Knopwood gave evidence before the same committee.
He stated that he had heard different opinions as to the origin
of the attack; that it was said the natives wanted to encamp on
the site of Birt's hut, half a mile from the camp, and had
ill-used his wife, but that the hut was not burnt or plundered.
They did not attack the camp, but our people went from the camp
to attack the natives, who remained at Birt's hut. He thought
only five or six natives were killed. The general opinion was
that the blacks had gone to Risdon to hold a corroboree.</p>
<p>These accounts throw great doubt on the accuracy of Lieut.
Moore's version of the affair. It is significant that Knopwood,
who had every opportunity of learning the truth at the time,
should state so positively that the natives never left the
neighbourhood of Birt's hut, but that the soldiers went out to
attack them.</p>
<p>It seems clear that the natives had no hostile intention in
their visit, and this was the conclusion of Governor Arthur's
committee. Everything goes to show that they were a party coming
from the east, probably the Oyster Bay tribe, engaged on a
hunting expedition, and that they were more astonished than the
English on coming into contact with them. The fact of their
having their women and children with them is perfectly conclusive
proof that no attack was contemplated. We can easily understand
how terrifying to the Risdon people must have been this sudden
inroad of a horde of excited savages, yelling and gesticulating.
Utterly ignorant of their customs, unable to understand them, or
to make themselves understood, the panic of the English,
convinced that the natives had collected in force to destroy
them, was natural enough. Doubtless the soldiers shared in the
general scare, and, moreover, were probably quite inclined to
take pot shots at the black savages. But Lieut. Moore ought not
to have lost his head. He, at least, should have grasped the
situation, and restrained his men. A little more presence of mind
on his part, the exercise of a little tact and forbearance, and a
collision would have been avoided, the natives would have been
conciliated, and the history of the black race in Tasmania might
have been different. That the aborigines of Tasmania would, in
any case, have melted away before the white man, as the
aborigines of the other colonies are melting away, is certain;
but if it had not been for Lieut. Moore's error at Risdon, a war
of extermination, with all its attendant horrors, might have been
averted.</p>
<p>There is little to add respecting this occurrence, except
that, according to White, some of the bones of the slaughtered
natives were sent in two casks to Port Jackson by Dr.
Mountgarret, and that the chaplain, ever anxious to extend the
bounds of his church, records that he went to Risdon a week later
and "xtiand a young native boy whose name was Robert Hobert
May"&mdash;the good chaplain having thus the honour of bestowing
his name on this first innocent aboriginal Christian. Collins
tells Governor King that the baptism had taken place without his
knowledge or consent, and when he found that Dr. Mountgarret
intended to take this two-year-old native to Sydney, he had the
boy brought to the camp, and directed that he should be returned
to his own people, for fear they should think he had been killed
and eaten by the English. "For," he remarks, "we have every
reason to believe them to be cannibals, and they may entertain
the same opinion of us." * The incident made Collins very
apprehensive of further attacks; and, indeed, a few days after
this affray the crew of the cutter, while collecting oyster
shells on the river bank opposite Hobart, was attacked by a
numerous party of natives, and beaten off with stones and
clubs.</p>
<p class="foot">[* There is no foundation for this opinion]</p>
<p>As I have already observed, Lieut.-Governor Collins was very
reluctant to have anything to do with the Risdon people and
would willingly have shipped them all off to Port Jackson; but he
now received express and positive instructions from Governor King
to take over the command; and, accordingly, on the 8th May
(immediately after Bowen's return from the Huon), a General Order
was issued, notifying that he had taken upon himself the command
of Risdon; that Lieut. Bowen was to continue in the direction of
the settlement under him until further orders, and that the
officers and prisoners were to return to Port Jackson in the
<i>Ocean</i>. The stores were immediately removed to Sullivan's
Cove, the few remaining prisoners being victualled from the
Hobart camp. The stock was also removed&mdash;17 head of cattle,
and 45 sheep and lambs; and, a few days later, the whole of the
prisoners were removed to the camp, where they could be kept at
work in one gang, under a strict guard and a vigilant
overseer.</p>
<p>Although Collins badly wanted more military, he did not care
to keep the small detachment of the New South Wales Corps, as he
had at first thought of doing; for, out of the 23 soldiers, one
had been taken to Sydney by Bowen for robbery, and he himself had
sent four others thither on a charge of mutiny. He, therefore,
determined to despatch them all to Sydney, where a Court Martial
could be assembled to correct and punish their evil propensities.
Of the convicts, 50 in number, there were only 11 men and 2 women
whom the Governor deemed it expedient to keep.</p>
<p>It was not until the 9th August that the <i>Ocean</i> got
under way for Sydney, and carried with her the whole civil and
military establishment,&mdash;Capt. John Bowen, Dr. Mountgarret,
Wilson the storekeeper, the turbulent soldiers and the mutinous
convicts, 40 or so, who had formed the first Settlement in Van
Diemen's Land. Thus ended the first and abortive Hobart.</p>
<p>The only free settler who remained was Richard Clark, who had
been made superintendent of stonemasons. Both King and Collins
speak highly of his character and capacity. Collins gave him a
similar position in the new Hobart at Sullivan's Cove; and in
this office he acquitted himself well. A few sheep were given
him, and a location of 200 acres on the other side of the river,
nearly opposite Hobart.</p>
<p>The other settler, Birt, had applied for and obtained leave to
remain; but at the last moment he changed his mind, and sailed
with the rest in the <i>Ocean</i>, which brought him under the
displeasure of Governor King, who refused to allow him a grant of
land. Dr. Mountgarret, also, at first desired to stay, as he had
been combining commerce with medicine, and had a large stock on
hand which he wished to dispose of; but he, eventually, changed
his mind, and he also sailed in the <i>Ocean</i>.</p>
<p>The net balance of the Risdon Settlement, therefore, remaining
with Collins, was Richard Clark and the 11 male and 2 female
convicts above mentioned. Collins afterwards ordered all the
houses at Risdon to be pulled down; but it does not appear
whether this was carried into effect. The <i>Ocean</i> did not
arrive in Port Jackson until the 23rd August, King having almost
given her up for lost. Dr. Mountgarret got a fresh appointment as
Surgeon to the new Settlement at Port Dalrymple, under
Lieut.-Colonel Paterson.</p>
<p>Lieut. Bowen had left a mare at the Derwent for which he had
paid &pound;120, and he offered her to King at that price. The
Governor agreed to purchase her on Government account, and paid
Bowen with four cows, which he stopped out of his next shipment
to Collins. This was the first horse taken to Van Diemen's
Land.</p>
<p>It only remains to state what more we know of the Governor of
Risdon Creek. On his arrival at Sydney he was desirous of
returning to England, in order that he might again enter on
active service in the navy. Governor King had offered him the
munificent pay of 5<i>s</i>. per day from the 30th June, 1803,
when he first sailed from Sydney in the <i>Porpoise</i>, to the
24th August, 1804, when he returned thither in the <i>Ocean</i>,
viz., 420 days, at 5<i>s</i>. per day, or
&pound;105&mdash;exactly one hundred guineas for 14 months'
governorship&mdash;certainly not an extravagant salary for a
governor&mdash;not enough to pay his passage to England. He
refused the colonial pay offered, and addressed a letter to King,
in which he reminds the Governor that pecuniary considerations
had not been in his view in accepting the appointment, but simply
the advancement of his interest in His Majesty's naval service;
but that, as he had been at great expense consequent on that
appointment, he trusted the Governor would recommend him to the
Home authorities for a sufficient remuneration. King enclosed the
letter to Lord Hobart, strongly recommending the application, as
he believed Bowen had done his utmost to forward the service he
undertook, and expressing a hope that, in addition to this, his
character, and that of his father and other relatives in the
navy, might open a way for the promotion he was so anxious to
obtain. King also paid his passage home in the <i>Lady
Barlow</i>, amounting to &pound;100.</p>
<p>It would seem that Lieut. Bowen obtained the promotion he
sought. Jorgensen&mdash;who, however, was not the most accurate
of men&mdash;states in his autobiography that the Commandant of
Risdon was a son of Commissioner Bowen. Mr. Leslie Stephen's
"Dictionary of National Biography", in a notice of Captain James
(afterwards Admiral) Bowen, who performed brilliant services at
sea during the French wars, mentions the fact that he was one of
the Commissioners of the Navy from 1816 to 1825, and that his son
John, also a captain, after serving in that rank through the
later years of the war, died in the year 1828.</p>
<p>With this brief notice of its founder, I close the story of
the first settlement at Risdon Cove.</p>

<h4>APPENDIX A.</h4>
<p align="center"><small>CAPTAIN HAYES' CHARTS.</small></p>
<p>A manuscript map, evidently the result of Lieut. Hayes'
surveys of the Derwent, was recently discovered by Mr. James R.
M'Clymont in the National Library. Mr. Alfred Mault has obtained,
through his friends in Paris, a <i>fac simile</i> of this map,
which he has courteously placed at the disposal of the Royal
Society, and a photo-lithograph of it will appear in this year's
volume of the Society's Proceedings. The map bears the imprint of
A. Arrowsmith, London, but apparently was never published. Mr.
Mault thinks it is Lieut. Hayes' own draft of his chart prepared
for publication. This is probable; but the map in question is not
identical with the sketch Flinders refers to, since that sketch
showed Risdon Cove, which does not appear in Mr. Mault's <i>fac
simile</i>. His Excellency the Governor has kindly interested
himself in the matter, and it is probable that, through his
influence, some further information respecting Hayes' expedition
may at last be brought to light.</p>

is stated that amongst the despatches carried by the

of troops, which might at any time be sent against the Spaniards
in South America, and it is suggested that the discovery of this
despatch amongst Flinders' papers gave Governor De Caen a
plausible excuse for the detention of the English navigator. It
is difficult to believe that this surmise has any sufficient

drawn from an entry in Flinders' journal.</p>

<h4>I. THE CHOICE OF SULLIVAN'S COVE.</h4>
<p>On the 30th January, 1804, the <i>Ocean</i> and <i>Lady
Nelson</i>, with the first detachment of Lieut.-Governor Collins'
establishment, sailed from the Heads of Port Phillip for the
Derwent. The <i>Lady Nelson</i> was commanded by Lieut. Simmons,
with Jorgen Jorgenson as first mate. She took the settlers and
their families, and the stores. The <i>Ocean</i> had on board 178
prisoners, with some women and children, a guard of 25 marines,
under Lieut. Edward Lord, and the civil establishment, consisting
of the Lieut.-Governor, the Rev. Robert Knopwood,
Surveyor-General Geo. Prideaux Harris, Mr. Adolarius W. H.
Humphreys, the Mineralogist, Dr. Bowden, and two Superintendents
of Convicts. The ship was greatly overcrowded. She had been
fitted up in England to carry some 30 people besides her crew.
She had now over 200 souls on board, and we can well believe Mr.
J. P. Fawkner when he says that they had a miserable time of it
during their 15 days' passage, cooped up in a small vessel of 480
tons. Fawkner says they suffered terribly from the want of cooked
food, as the cooking accommodation for 25 had to serve for the
whole 200. They were 10 days reaching the Pillar, and were there
caught in a heavy south-wester, which kept them two days off the
Raoul. It then came on to blow hard from the north-west, which
obliged Capt. Mertho to bear up for Frederick Henry Bay, where he
came to an anchor off Pipe Clay Lagoon. Here Lieut. Lord and Mr.
Humphreys were landed, with four men, to walk up to Risdon with
despatches, while the vessel lay wind-bound for another three
days, the officers amusing themselves by going ashore, where they
were very much pleased with the appearance of the country and the
abundance of game and wild fowl. The boat's crew filled their
boat with fine oysters in half an hour on the shores of the
lagoon. They also fell in with a party of 17 natives, who were
very friendly. On the 5th February a change of wind enabled them
to make the entrance of the river, where they were met by the
boat of the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, which had arrived before them,
and they ran up before the sea breeze, anchoring at half-past six
in Risdon Cove, off the settlement of which Lieut. Moore was in
charge, Lieut. Bowen being absent at Port Jackson.</p>
<p>At 10 the next morning, the Lieut.-Governor, with Lieut. Lord
and the Chaplain, landed under a salute of 11 guns from the
<i>Ocean</i>&mdash;the first salute fired in the Derwent&mdash;to
inspect the Risdon settlement. They were received with military
honours by Lieut. Moore and the 16 privates of the New South
Wales Corps drawn up under arms. After inspecting the settlement,
the Lieut.-Governor came to the conclusion that Risdon was not a
suitable site for a town, and returned on board the <i>Ocean</i>
very much disappointed. It was the report of the advantages of
Risdon that "had led him to decide in favour of the Derwent
rather than the Tamar, and now he had brought his people to a
spot that promised as little as the abandoned Port Phillip.
However, the next morning was bright with sunshine, and as he
looked out over the waters of the Derwent, with its picturesque
scenery of hill and valley and thickly wooded plains, things
looked less gloomy. To be prepared for the worst, he directed the
tents to be pitched at Risdon. Then the boat was ordered out and
put in charge of the trusted William Collins, and the Governor,
taking with him his favourite companion, Mr. Knopwood, was pulled
down the river to a cove on the opposite shore some five miles
below Risdon, and which had probably attracted attention on the
way up. Here Collins landed, and, after a short examination, made
up his mind that it was the very place for his settlement. We can
imagine his admiration of the fine cove, with deep water up to
the shore, and his profound satisfaction, after four months on
the dry sandhills of Sorrento, at finding himself on a
well-wooded and fertile plain, lying at the foot of the great
Table Mountain, and watered by a copious stream of splendid fresh
water. In his first despatch to Lord Hobart, he says that the
situation was all he could wish. There was land of good quality
immediately about him sufficient for extensive agricultural
purposes. The timber and stone were in sufficient quantity and
quality for all his needs, and the cove would make an admirable
harbour. Knopwood describes the site, not very accurately, as an
"extensive plain, with a continual run of water, which comes from
the lofty mountain much resembling the Table Mountain at the Cape
of Good Hope. The land is good, and the trees excellent. The
plain is calculated in every degree for a settlement. At five we
returned and dined with the Governor, much delighted with the
excursion." Collins devoted another day to the examination of a
plain further up the river&mdash;probably in the neighbourhood of
Glenorchy&mdash;which, he thought, might serve for the location
of his free settlers. The trees were large and good, but the
ground was so cut up by torrents that he decided it to be
unsuitable. In the meantime the officers had been sent to look at
the first site, and they returned with their unanimous approval
of it. The Governor forthwith ordered the tents to be struck and
sent on board the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, and the two ships were
moved out of the cove. On the Sunday morning, in a strong
northerly breeze, they dropped down the river and anchored off
the bay, to which the Lieut.-Governor gave the name of Sullivan's
Cove, in honour of his friend Mr. John Sullivan, the Permanent
Under-Secretary at the Colonial Office.</p>
<p>Monday morning (20th February) was squally and wet, but in the
afternoon the weather cleared, and a body of prisoners with a
military guard was landed to pitch the tents on the selected
site. At four o'clock the Lieut.-Governor himself, with his
officers, went on shore for a short time to superintend
operations. That night the marines and convicts slept at the new
camp&mdash;the first Europeans to sleep on the site of the future
capital of Tasmania.</p>
<p>In a despatch to Governor King [29th Feb., 1804], Collins
gives a description of the Cove in its original state. "In the
centre of the Cove", he writes, "is a small island, connected
with the mainland at low water, admirably adapted for the landing
and reception of stores and provisions. Round this island is a
channel for a boat, at the head of which is a run of clear fresh
water, proceeding from a distance inland, and having its source
in a rock in the vicinity of Table Mountain. The ground on each
side of the run is of gradual ascent, and upon that next the Cove
I have formed my camp. The <i>Ocean</i> and <i>Lady Nelson</i>
are lying within half a cable-length of the shore in nine fathoms
water." The inhabitants of Hobart will hardly recognise their
harbour in Collins' description. The filling up has been so
considerable as to obliterate the original natural features. The
creek has been diverted from its course, and the island, which
Collins named Hunter's Island, after his old patron, has been
swallowed up in the Old Wharf. Originally the Cove was much more
extensive than it is at present. The island, which now forms the
extremity of the Old Wharf, was then in the middle of the bay.
This island was connected with the mainland by a long sandspit,
covered at high water, and the site of which is now occupied by
the long range of stores forming the Old Wharf. The bottom of the
Cove was marked by a yellow sandstone bluff, since cut away, and
now forming the cliff overhanging the creek at the back of the
hospital. A little below this was the original mouth of the
creek, which issued out of a dense tangle of tea-tree scrub and
fallen logs, surmounted by huge gum trees. It fell into the river
just at the intersection of Campbell-street and Macquarie-street,
at the lower angle of the New Market building. The land at the
creek mouth was flat and marshy for some distance. On the side
towards the town the beach curved round the site of the old
Bonded Stores, thence, along a slope covered with gum trees, by
the back of the Town Hall, by Risby's Sawmill and the Parliament
Houses, past St. David's churchyard, and thence along the line of
stone stores on the New Wharf to the Ordnance Stores, and round
the old Mulgrave Battery Point. On the side of the creek towards
the Domain was a low swampy flat, extending over Wapping and
Lower Collins and Macquarie streets to the Park-street Rivulet
and the present bridge leading to the Domain. Thence the beach
ran round the foot of a wooded slope by the present Gas Company's
office, along the course of the railway embankment, to Macquarie
Point.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* I am indebted to my friend Mr. Mault for a
beautifully executed plan (<i>see</i> Appendix) which shows very
clearly the original features of the ground, and the position of
the first camp, and also indicates the alterations which have
since taken place. It is taken from a survey made by
Surveyor-General Harris in 1804-5. The original plan was
discovered many years ago in the Lands Office at Sydney, and was
presented by the New South Wales Government to our Lands
Department. The Deputy-Commissioner of Crown Lands, Mr. Albert
Reid, kindly presented me with a tracing of it.]</p>
<br>

<h4>2. THE FOUNDING OF HOBART.</h4>
<p>On Tuesday, the 21st February, 1804, the <i>Ocean</i> and
<i>Lady Nelson</i> were warped up to within half a cable length
of Hunter's Island, the rest of the people were landed, and the
discharge of the stores began. The Lieut.-Governor's tent was
pitched on the slope overlooking the cove near the spot where the
Town Hall now stands. The Chaplain's marquee was pitched next to
the Governor's, and those of the other civil officers in close
proximity on the same slope. The tents of the convicts were
further inland, extending from about the present Telegraph Office
at the corner of Macquarie and Elizabeth streets, back to
Collins-street to the edge of the scrub in the valley of the
creek. The camp of the marines was placed higher up towards the
Cathedral. On the Tuesday night, Knopwood says, "I slept at the
camp for the first time, and so did the Lieut.-Governor."
Jorgensen, who, as mate of the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, had assisted
at the settlement of Risdon in the preceding September, and was
now in the same capacity assisting at the founding of Hobart,
gives us a graphic sketch of the scene on that first day. As soon
as the tents had been pitched under the shadow of the great
gum-trees, spades, hoes, saws, and axes were put into the hands
of the prisoners, and they began clearing away as fast as they
could. The block just opposite the Tasmania Museum, behind the
old Bank of Van Diemen's Land building to the neighbouring mouth
of the creek, was then an impervious grove of the densest
tea-tree scrub, surmounted by some of the largest gum-trees that
this island can produce. All along the rivulet, as far up as the
old mill beyond Molle-street Bridge, was impassable from the
denseness of the scrub, and the huge collections of fallen trees
and dead timber which had been washed down the stream and were
strewed and piled in confusion in its bed. In many places the
stream was dammed back, and spread out into marshes covered with
rushes and water.</p>
<p>Governor Collins had amongst his various stores a small
printing press, which had already done service at the Port
Phillip camp. This was set up under a convenient gum-tree, and on
the day of landing the first printed work issued from the
Tasmanian press. It was a General Order, fixing the weekly
rations to be issued to each person&mdash;viz., 7 lbs. beef or 4
lbs. pork, 7 lbs. flour, and 6 ozs. sugar. The second day's
Order, with a backward glance at the casks sunk at the foot of
the Port Phillip sandhills, expressed the Governor's satisfaction
at having been enabled to fix the settlement advantageously, and
in a situation blessed with that great comfort of life, a
permanent supply of pure running water, and cautioned the people
against polluting the stream. On the third day the hours of
labour were fixed. The Lieut.-Governor having thus given his
people some elementary lessons, enforced by appropriate
sanctions, on the mutual rights and duties of the individual and
the State, proceeded to care for their spiritual requirements,
and on the fourth day issued an order for a general muster of the
prisoners, and notified that on Sunday, weather permitting,
divine service would be performed, at which all were expected to
attend.</p>
<p>Hunter's Island had been appropriated for the site of the
store tents, for which purpose it was admirably adapted, not only
on account of its handiness as a landing place, but also because
its isolated position made it comparatively safe from plunderers.
All available hands were now employed to discharge the stores.
The ships were moored at a short distance from the shore, and the
cargo taken off in boats. A wharf was begun at the landing-place
on the island, and a way was formed along the sandspit by means
of which the mainland could be more conveniently reached at low
tide. These works were placed under the superintendence of Mr.
William Collins, the hero of the boat expedition to Port Jackson,
and who had already given the Governor many proofs of his
capacity. Even the Chaplain, usually the only idle man in the
settlement, found employment during the first week. His diary
tells us that it cost him three days' work to prepare a sermon
worthy to be the first preached in the new colony. On Sunday,
then, under the gum-trees on the slope near the Governor's tent,
overlooking the waters of the Derwent sparkling in the bright
February sunshine, the military paraded, the prisoners were drawn
up, the officers and settlers formed a group apart, and the Rev.
Robert Knopwood conducted the first service in Tasmania. "The
sermon, by request of the Lieut.-Governor, was upon the
prosperity of the new settlement, and to pray to God for a
blessing upon the increase of it." This first Sunday had,
however, practical duties, and after service the <i>Ocean</i>'s
boats moved the settlers, with their families and baggage, to the
spot which had been fixed upon for them on the shores of New Town
Bay, then known as Stainsforth's Cove, not far from where the
Risdon Road leaves the Main Road.</p>

<p>Of the group who landed at Sullivan's Cove in February, 1804,
with our first Governor, the best remembered, and, indeed, the
only one of whom tradition has anything to say, is the Chaplain,
the Rev. Robert Knopwood. The survivor of all Collins' officers,
he lived to times well within living memory, and many an old
settler still tell stories of his eccentricities. His spare wiry
little figure, on the well-known cream-coloured pony, is familiar
to us from Mr. Gregson's painting, taken in his later days when
the camp had grown into a town, and he had bachelor quarters at
Cottage Green, Of his qualifications as the spiritual guide of
the young colony not much can be said, and of this he must have
been fully sensible if the tradition is correct which reports his
favourite saying to have been, "Do as I say, not as I do." The
choice of Mr. Knopwood as Chaplain was an unfortunate one. There
was a fine field in those early days for a man who would have
devoted himself&mdash;as Bishop Willson and others did in later
years&mdash;with wise enthusiasm to the elevation of the society
in which his work lay. It is doubtful whether Mr. Knopwood,
clergyman though he was, ever made any serious attempt to raise
the moral or religious tone of the community. He had been a
chaplain in the navy, and, like too many chaplains of those days,
was content to acquiesce easily and without uncomfortable
protestations in the ways which were current. As a colonist, or
in any other capacity than a clergyman, he would have been
valuable; as a chaplain he was a failure. Yet he was a genial
little fellow, fond of good company and of a good dinner, not
averse to a glass of good wine or a pipe with a friend, a lover
of animals, an ardent sportsman, of a kindly nature, always ready
to give good-natured help to any one in need. In spite of his
grave deficiencies, and the conviction that he would have been
better in a secular calling, one cannot help having a kindly
feeling for the man who was always popular in the settlement, and
was long familiarly remembered amongst early settlers as "Old
Bobby Knopwood". The diary of the chaplain is the only
contemporary material, except grave official documents, which we
have for the history of the founding of Hobart. It runs to the
end of 1804. The entries are meagre, and too much limited to
records of dinners and the interchange of hospitalities amongst
the officers; yet it is naive and candid, and supplies
interesting detail. Official records are dry reading, but even
they yield unexpected treasures to careful study; and, from the
early despatches of Lieut.-Governor Collins to Governor King and
Lord Hobart, and from Collins' General Orders, with occasional
side-lights from the Chaplain's diary, we can form an idea of
life in the quaint little camp which at the beginning of this
century was pitched on the narrow rise between the waters of
Sullivan's Cove and the thick belt of tea-tree scrub shading the
course of the Hobart Creek.</p>
<p>The Governor had planted his settlers at a safe distance at
New Town Bay, and his total strength at Sullivan's Cove consisted
of 178 convicts and the guard of 25 marines under Lieut. Edward
Lord. The selection of prisoners for the settlement had been very
carelessly made. The frequent burden of Collins' complaint to the
Colonial Office is that he was encumbered with so many old, worn
out, or useless men, who ate the precious provisions, better
bestowed on artificers and stout labourers. Out of the whole 307
men who sailed with him 137 were labourers, but the trades useful
in a new colony were very insufficiently represented, and the
weavers, silversmiths, engravers, and clerks supplied to him by
the authorities with more than sufficient liberality were likely
to have long to wait before finding scope for their talents. In
fact, the usual official bungling was exemplified in the new
colony. The stores supplied by contract were as bad as usual. The
Governor makes an exception in favour of the provisions, which he
says were excellent, the salt beef and pork being better than any
he had seen in New South Wales. But with respect to the other
stores he has one long complaint to make. The tools were bad; the
axes so soft that the commonest wood would turn their edges; of
the gimlets scarce one in a dozen would stand boring twice. The
materials for clothing were of poor quality, and the thread
rotten. The shoes were made of inferior leather, and were all of
one size. The surgical instruments were of an obsolete pattern,
and many of them worn out. The iron was rolled and not wrought,
while neither glue, borax, resin, nor bar steel had been thought
of, so that the carpenters and smiths were in difficulties. The
ordnance that had been given him for defence was incomplete, the
guns of different sizes and patterns, while the ammunition was
all of one sort. The seed corn brought from England would not
vegetate, and if it had not been for some good seed which he
obtained at the Cape, and some more which Governor King sent him,
he could not have raised a crop of wheat. Except the provisions,
the printing press was the only item of which he could speak with
satisfaction, but for this they had not given him a sufficient
supply of type or of paper. Of course, when the contractors were
communicated with they all protested that the goods were
carefully selected, of a quality superior to the pattern, and
quite equal to those which the convicts had had heretofore.
Perhaps this last statement was correct.</p>
<p>In spite of these minor difficulties, the work of settlement
and improvement was pushed on with an energy and system
presenting a strong contrast to the inaction and disorder of the
Port Phillip camp. When the landing jetty at Hunter's Island was
completed, all the strength that could be spared from the work of
clearing was bent to the building of a Government House. He had
178 men in all, but when the necessary deductions were made for
overseers, servants, cooks, boats' crews, labourers clearing away
scrub or employed in other necessary work, and for the
sick&mdash;always a large item, owing to the prevalence of scurvy
and other ailments induced by the exclusive use of salt
provisions&mdash;it will be seen that no large number would be
left for the actual work of building.* It is most probable that
the Governor selected and brought with him in the first
detachment all the skilled workmen, leaving the most useless at
Port Phillip with Lieut. Sladden; but still the number available
was small.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Appendix: Return of Employments.]</p>
<p>No idle time was allowed in the settlement. The bell rang at
five in the morning, and the convicts turned out, clad in blue
kersey jackets and trousers, and proceeded at once under their
overseers to their various employments. Work was continued, with
intervals of an hour for breakfast and an hour and a half for
dinner, until six o'clock in the evening, when the bell gave the
signal for the close of the day's labour. On Tuesday an extra
hour was allowed for the issue of rations; Saturday was a
half-holiday after 11 <small>A.M</small>.; and it was only under
exceptional circumstances that any labour was required on
Sunday.</p>
<p>There was ample work for all hands. A large proportion of the
people had to be employed clearing away and burning the scrub,
grubbing stumps, trenching, digging and preparing garden ground.
Building operations were necessarily slow. A quarry had to be
opened on the sandstone point near the mouth of the creek to
supply stone for foundations. Oyster shells were gathered from
the beaches and burnt for lime. Governor King had sent a quantity
of bricks from Port Jackson, and these were utilised for
chimneys. The fine gums on the banks of the creek furnished an
abundant supply of good timber. Stringent regulations were
enforced against the useless destruction of the timber, and no
trees might be felled without the permission of the
Superintendent of Carpenters, to which office the Governor had
appointed Mr. Wm. Nicholls, who had come out in the <i>Ocean</i>
as a free settler. With the inferior axes supplied by the
Government contractors, and which had their edges turned by the
hard gum wood, felling was a tedious operation; and when the
trees were felled and sawn into lengths, the logs had to be
dragged to the sawpits by hand labour, and the sawn timber
carried thence by the same means, for as yet there were neither
horses nor oxen in the colony. The sawyers, of whom it appears
there were nine, were constantly employed at the saw-pits cutting
the logs into posts and planks&mdash;two men at each log with a
ripping saw&mdash;in the slow and laborious method so familiar to
those whose memory goes back to the days when steam sawmills were
not. The progress at the sawpits was so slow that the Governor,
notwithstanding his preference for day work, found it necessary
at a later period to put the sawyers on task work; and no sawyer
was allowed to work for his own profit unless he and his mate had
turned out at least 400 feet of sawn timber in the week on the
public account. It speaks well for the industry of the community
and the energy of the administration, that the sawyers,
carpenters, and other mechanics made such good progress with
their work that in less than three weeks from the day of landing
Government House was completed, and the Chaplain records in his
diary on the 9th March, "The Lieut.-Governor slept in his house
for the first time." This first wooden Government House was not
on the same site as the brick building of later years, but stood
on the spot now marked by the main entrance of the Town Hall.</p>
<p>So soon as the Lieut.-Governor had got his house built he
turned his attention to agriculture. A gang of some thirty men
was sent to prepare ground for wheat for the use of the
settlement. The place chosen was near the locations where the
settlers had been set down a month before, on the shore of a bay
named Farm Bay. This appears to have been at Cornelian Bay, at
what was long known as the Government Farm, but is now occupied
by the Cornelian Bay Cemetery. The farm was placed under the
charge of Mr. Thomas Clark, who had been brought out from England
as Agricultural Superintendent.</p>
<p>Collins' next care was to get his people housed under better
shelter than canvas tents afforded. They were encouraged to use
their spare time in building huts. This was an employment for
Saturday afternoons, for Sundays&mdash;after service, when that
was held&mdash;and for the occasional holidays allowed for the
purpose by the indulgence of the Governor. The huts were of most
primitive construction, being for the most part what old settlers
will remember under the name of wattle-and-dab&mdash;or
wattle-and-daub&mdash;with a rush thatch. Let me give you an idea
of what a wattle-and-dab hut was like, and how it was built. Four
corner posts were stuck in the ground, and upon these wall-plates
were rested or nailed; further uprights were then added, and long
rods of wattle from the bush were interwoven with the uprights,
openings being left for door and windows. Mortar was then made of
clay and loam, into which was mixed and beaten up wiry grass
chopped up as a substitute for hair. This mortar was dabbed and
plastered against the wattles outside and in, the roof covered in
with flag-grass, a chimney built of stones or turf, a door and
window added, the earthen floor levelled, and a coat of whitewash
completed the cottage. It is said that the first house in Hobart
was a wattle-and-dab hut built by Lieut. Lord on land adjoining
Macquarie House. In less than two months after the <i>Ocean</i>
and <i>Lady Nelson</i> had anchored in Sullivan's Cove the huts
were completed and the people were all provided with fairly
comfortable habitations, occupying a line from the Commercial
Bank to the Hobart Club in Collins-street, and thence along the
edge of the scrub to the Australian Mutual Provident Society's
Building. A General Order of 17th April enjoins strict attention
to the cleanliness and order of the huts, and to precautions
against danger by fire.</p>
<p>When the huts were finished the prisoners were at liberty to
work in their spare time for the officers and settlers, in
clearing locations, preparing and fencing in gardens, trenching
and hoeing the ground for corn or vegetables, and building
houses. Labour was scarce, and the demand being greater than the
supply, the work people were not slow to take advantage of the
necessity by demanding exorbitant prices for their labour. The
abuse became so considerable that by General Order (1st June),
the Lieut.-Governor appointed a Committee composed of the civil
and military officers, together with three of the settlers, to
meet on Sunday, after service, and fix the rate of wages. The new
prices for labour were promulgated by General Order of 22nd June.
Mechanics for the day of 10 hours were to be paid 3<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>., and labourers 2<i>s</i>. <i>6</i>d. For felling and
burning timber, 30<i>s</i>. per acre; for grubbing and burning,
&pound;4 per acre; for breaking up new ground, &pound;2 per acre.
For reaping wheat, 10<i>s</i>. per acre. For sawing, 8<i>s</i>.
4<i>d</i>. per 100 feet. Splitting 7-feet palings, 3<i>s</i>. per
100; 5-feet palings, 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per 100. Oyster shells
for lime, 3<i>d</i>. per bushel. Thatch, 6<i>d</i>. per bundle of
9 feet girth. The workmen were often paid for their labour in
provisions, and the Order fixed the following equivalent
rates:&mdash;Salt beef, 9<i>d</i>. per lb.; salt pork,
1<i>s</i>.; kangaroo, 8<i>d</i>. per lb.; flour, 1<i>s</i>. per
lb. So that for a day's work of 10 hours, a labourer could
procure 1 lb. of pork and 1&frac12; lbs. of flour, and a mechanic
2 lbs. of beef and 2 lbs. flour. Payment for labour, however, was
often made in a more objectionable medium, raw spirit. At a very
early period the Governor issued a stringent order against this
most pernicious practice. Nevertheless, in spite of Government
regulations it continued to be a crying evil, and for many a long
year the abuse continued. Many a Hobart building has been paid
for in rum. More could be got for spirits than for cash. A bottle
of rum was long recognised currency for &pound;1, or even a
higher value. It is probable that very little labour in those
early days was paid for in cash. The want of specie prevented the
payment of the salaries of the officers and superintendents, and
to meet this difficulty, and to supply the officers with the
means of purchasing necessary articles brought by vessels coming
from Sydney, the Commissary was directed to issue small
promissory notes of not less than &pound;1 sterling in value.
These were to pass in circulation until specie was sent out.</p>
<p>The little camp on the hill above Sullivan's Cove must have
been a grotesque and rough-looking village, with its collection
of wattle-and-dab huts thatched with grass. The officers, for the
most part, still occupied tents, the hospital was a marquee, and
the only piece of architecture making any pretence to be a
civilised dwelling was the wooden cottage of the Governor.
Hunter's Island was the citadel of the colony. Here all the
stores were kept in large tents under a strong guard, which,
however, did not always prevent robberies. At low water the
island could now be reached by the sandspit. The approach was
carefully guarded, and the most minute regulations were laid down
for the issue of stores and provisions, only one person at a time
being allowed to come up to the store tent. Those who landed at
the jetty were not permitted to make any stoppage at the island;
no boat was allowed to land passengers at the jetty Or come into
the creek after sunset, nor was any person suffered to approach
the island after that hour without a special permit from the
Governor. These precautions were necessary, not only for the
protection of the stores, but to secure the safety of the boats,
always in danger of seizure by intending runaways. The boats were
moored every night by a locked chain, a sentinel was always on
guard over them, and one of the earliest works, after the
completion of Government House, was the building of a boat-house
for their security.</p>
<p>Mr. William Collins was supreme in the direction of the works
in and about the island, and the Governor was already planning
the erection of substantial store-houses there, in which the
precious provisions and stores, on which the very existence of
his little community depended, might be safely housed beyond the
reach of marauders. This William Collins was a prominent man in
the new colony, a position which his training as a master in the
navy, his enterprising character, and his capacity and judgment
fully justified. His adventures and plucky voyage in an open boat
from Port Phillip to Port Jackson with despatches will be
remembered. Since that time he had done good service in examining
Port Dalrymple, in company with Surveyor-General Harris and
Agricultural Superintendent Clark, while the Governor was still
lingering at Port Phillip undecided as to his final destination.
He was now raised to the dignity of Harbour Master of the port,
and was a person of no small consequence in the settlement.</p>
<p>The Lieut.-Governor, in his despatches to the Colonial Office,
enlarges on the advantages of Hobart for purposes of commerce,
and speaks of the spot chosen for the settlement as "a port the
advantages of which, when once known, will ensure its being the
general rendezvous of all shipping bound into these seas." For
the present, however, merchant ships were absolutely for bidden,
under severe penalties, from entering the Derwent, except in case
of absolute necessity. The masters of vessels sailing from Port
Jackson for Van Diemen's Land had to enter into a recognizance of
&pound;100, and two sureties in &pound;50 each, to be forfeited
if they landed any person or took any one away without the
Governor's written permission. No one but the Harbour Master was
allowed to board any vessel arriving in the river. These
restrictions on merchant ships were not removed until the year
1813.</p>
<p>But while trading was thus prohibited, the development of the
whale fishery, from which Hobart in after years drew so much
wealth, early engaged the Governor's attention. By his desire
William Collins drew up a scheme for the establishment of an
extensive whaling station at Sullivan's Cove. This memorandum,
which was forwarded to the Secretary for the Colonies for his
approval, is well written, and shows that the Harbour Master was
a man of good education and shrewd practical sense. He works out
a plan for making Sullivan's Cove the centre of a South Sea sperm
whale fishery&mdash;advising on the description of the vessels to
be employed, their plant and equipment, the number of men
required, the mode of their remuneration by lays on the take, the
necessary local superintendence, and all the details of the
scheme, with an estimate of probable profits. The sperm whale
season lasted from December to April. William Collins says that
when the season for sperm whales and for sealing on the islands
was over, the vessels could arrive in the Derwent in time to get
rid of their catch, and then pursue the beach whale fishery,
which commenced early in July and continued until September.
During these months Storm Bay Passage, Frederick Henry Bay, and
the Derwent abounded with the black whale or right fish, and a
dozen vessels yearly could be freighted and sent home with their
oil. The right whale was frequently seen in the Derwent in
considerable numbers out of the regular season, but during the
months of July, August, and September they were so numerous in
the shoal parts of the river that from his tent in the camp at
Sullivan's Cove he had counted as many as 50 or 60 whales in the
river at one time.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Knopwood in his diary (1st July) speaks of
whales being so numerous in the river that his boat had to keep
close along the shore, it being dangerous to venture into the
mid-channel. The <i>Alexander</i> whaler, Captain Rhodes, fished
in the Derwent and Storm Bay Passage from August to the end of
October in this same year, and went home a full ship. There are
persons yet living who can remember the time when bay-whaling, as
it was called, had not ceased to be profitable. We have a
reminiscence of this old industry in the name of Tryway Point, by
which one of the promontories in the Derwent is still sometimes
known.]</p>
<p>The Lieut.-Governor had his time fully occupied in directing
the development of the settlement. Everything had his daily
supervision. The planning of the buildings, the clearing of the
ground, the marking off of gardens, the allotment of servants to
the officers, the regulation of labour, the provisions, the
stores, the punishment of offences, and the general discipline
and regulation of the people, down to the smallest detail,
required the personal sanction of His Honor. In addition to the
care of the camp, the new Government farm demanded his constant
attention, for the prosperity of the new settlement largely
depended on the progress of cultivation. The intervening scrub
made it difficult to reach the farm by land, and Henry Hacking,
the Governor's coxswain, with his boat's crew, frequently pulled
His Honor to Cornelian Bay to inspect the work of Superintendent
Clark and his thirty men, who had now some 19 acres in crop, and
to pay a visit to the settlers' locations a short distance beyond
at Stainforth's Cove. The officers of the settlement, too, had
little spare time on their hands, for the Governor was eager to
get on with the public buildings, and the workmen could only be
kept industrious by close and constant supervision and the
strictest discipline. The Chaplain was probably the only really
idle man in the camp. His professional duties were not heavy,
consisting of one service and a sermon on Sundays, when the
weather was fine, for there was no building large enough for the
people to assemble in. Occasionally there was a burial or a
marriage. During the first six months there were three weddings.
On Sunday, the 18th March, Corporal Gangell of the Royal Marines
was married to Mrs. Ann Skelthorn, the widow of a settler, at
Governor Collins' house. On the 1st July, at the same place, Mr.
Superintendent Ingle was married to Miss Rebecca Hobbs, and on
the 23rd July, Mr. Gunn to Miss Patterson. But the Chaplain had
plenty of idle time. His poultry yard occupied a good deal of his
attention, and he chronicles his successes with sittings of eggs,
and the raids made upon his hens by spotted cats, which he
occasionally captured. His chief resource was his gun. During the
first fortnight he shot quail in the camp, on one occasion
putting up three by Mr. Bowden's marquee and bagging them.
Bronzewing pigeons he sometimes shot. On the 13th March he killed
his first kangaroo, adding&mdash;"the first kangaroo that had
been killed by any of the gentlemen in the camp." Many a walk
through the adjoining bush he took, gun in hand, and accompanied
by his dog "Nettle". Sometimes he went by himself, sometimes with
his man Salmon, who was a better sportsman than his master, and
shot the largest kangaroo recorded as being killed on the present
site of Hobart. Mr. Knopwood has preserved the weight and
measurements. It weighed 150 lbs., and measured 3 feet 10 from
the tip of the nose to the root of the tail, the tail being 3
feet 4 long, and 16 inches in girth at the root. Sometimes Lieut.
Bowen, or some of the officers from Risdon joined the Chaplain in
his shooting expeditions, more rarely Surveyor-General Harris, or
Mr. Humphreys, the mineralogist. The parson's skill was scarcely
equal to his zeal, for though he extended his walks as far as the
Government farm and the settler's locations at Stainforth's Cove,
and game was fairly plentiful, the diary often contains! the
entry "no success". It was not altogether the love of sport that
spurred the Chaplain to these excursions&mdash;he went to shoot
something for dinner. Twelve or fifteen months of salt beef and
salt pork, without even vegetables, would have made a man less
fond of good things than the parson long for a change, and
kangaroo was greatly appreciated. Of the first kangaroo he tasted
at Port Phillip, he says, "and very excellent it was". He is
equally emphatic as to the excellence of the emu, on which he
dined at Risdon. On one occasion he gave a dinner in his tent to
all the civil and military officers. Here is the bill of
fare:&mdash;"Fish, kangaroo soup, roast kid saddle, roast
kangaroo saddle, 2 fowls pellewed with rice and bacon, roast
pig." Game was plentiful at the camp, and kangaroo sold at
8<i>d</i>. per lb. Sometimes good hauls of fish were made. Soon
after his landing, the Lieut.-Governor tells Lord Hobart that on
the preceding day he had served out 328 lbs. of fish, thereby
saving 164 lbs. of salt beef. At Risdon game was much more
abundant than in the neighbourhood of the Camp. Kangaroo, emu,
ducks, and black swans were very plentiful. Immense flights of
black swans frequented the river above Risdon in the breeding
season. The people destroyed them so recklessly that the
Governor, fearing lest such a valuable resource for fresh food
might be extinguished, issued an Order [10th March] prohibiting
their being molested during the breeding season . This first game
law was one of the earliest products of civilisation.</p>
<p>We have little information respecting the numbers of the
natives about the neighbourhood of the Camp. During the first
week their fires were seen at a little distance, and Mr.
Knopwood, in his walks, saw many of their huts. There is no doubt
that they reconnoitred the strangers closely, but they were very
shy, and only once did a party of them approach the settlement.
Captain Mertho and Mr. Brown, the botanist, had an interview with
them on the beach near Macquarie Point, but could not induce them
to venture into the Camp. They were probably not very numerous
about Sullivan's Cove&mdash;at any rate, we hear nothing of such
large bodies of them as visited Risdon and caused a panic on the
3rd May, when the fatal affray took place. At other places, such
as Frederick Henry Bay and the Huon, they were numerous, and
quite friendly with the English.</p>
<p>During this first year few attempts were made to explore the
neighbouring country. In a former paper I noticed Mr. James
Meehan's exploring trip from Risdon in the early part of 1804, by
way of the Coal River to Prosser's Plains, and through the Sorell
district. Of Meehan's journey there is no record, except the
track of his route given in Flinders' map. The few officers at
Sullivan's Cove had too much to do at the Camp to allow of their
leaving it for any extended excursions. The first explorations
from the Hobart settlement were made by Mr. Robert Brown,* the
celebrated botanist, who had come to the Derwent with Collins'
settlers, to examine the flora of Tasmania. Lieut. Bowen had
ascended the river for some distance above Bridgewater, but on
5th March Mr. Brown, accompanied by Capt. Mertho and Mr.
Knopwood, set out in the <i>Ocean</i>'s boat on a more extended
exploration. They were three days absent, and Knopwood says they
reached a spot more than 40 miles from the Camp, where there was
an extensive plain, with very few trees&mdash;probably Macquarie
Plains. Game&mdash;kangaroo, emu, and pigeons&mdash;was;
abundant. They saw many traces of the blacks, who, however,
carefully avoided them. Towards the end of the month, Brown and
Humphreys, with a party provisioned for ten days, made a further
attempt to reach the sources of the Derwent, but had to return
disappointed. A few days later the indefatigable botanist set off
alone through the bush, intending to go to the Huon. He was
unable to get further than the North-West Bay River; but on the
1st May he and Humphreys started again, and this time they
succeeded in reaching the Huon, returning to the Camp after an
absence of sixteen days. Lieut. Bowen had already been a short
distance up this river, and had given but a poor account of the
country. In June, William Collins, the Harbour Master, went in
the white cutter to Betsy's Island, to land two refractory
convicts there, and to look out for the anxiously-expected ship
<i>Ocean</i>, with the rest of the people from Port Phillip. From
Betsy's Island Collins proceeded up the Huon River. He was away a
fortnight, and on his return reported that it was a very
favourable site for a settlement, with an abundance of fresh
water, good land, and fine trees. He saw many of the natives who
were friendly, and took him to their camp, where there were about
twenty families. Knopwood says that on this trip Collins saw
three of the native "catamarans, or small boats made of bark,
that would hold about six of them."</p>
<p class="foot">[* Robert Brown was a botanist of European
reputation, and his "Prodromus Flor&aelig;
Nov&aelig;-Hollandi&aelig; et Insula Van Diemen" (London, 1810),
is still a standard work. He arrived at the Derwent in the
<i>Lady Nelson</i> early in February, 1804, and returned to Port
Jackson in the <i>Ocean</i>, 9th August in the same year.]</p>
<p>The only other exploration recorded is Surveyor-General
Harris' survey of the Hobart Rivulet. Harris was accompanied by
Mr. Humphreys, the mineralogist, and three men. They followed the
rivulet to its source, and thence went to the top of the
mountain. The old plan which I have mentioned was probably the
result of this survey.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that when the Lieut.-Governor removed
his people to Sullivan's Cove, he did not interfere with Lieut.
Bowen at Risdon, but left that officer in-charge at the site
chosen by him in the previous September. It was not until after
Lieut. Moore's fatal affray with the blacks (3rd May) that
Collins took over the command of the unlucky first settlement,
and removed the people to Sullivan's Cove, preparatory to their
being sent back to Port Jackson. The Risdon colony had been named
"Hobart", under instructions from Governor King, and, on the
abandonment of that place, Collins appropriated the name, and
called his new settlement at Sullivan's Cove "Hobart Town". This
name it retained until 1881, when the Legislature dropped the
superfluous "Town", and reverted to the simple original
designation "Hobart". The name "Hobart Town" first appears in a
General Order of 15th June, 1804. Hobart Town was henceforth the
official designation of the colony; "but the memory of the first
encampment lingered long with the early settlers, and at that
time, and for long years afterwards, even as late as the year
1825, the new town at Sullivan's Cove was familiarly known as
"The Camp."</p>
<p>The Lieut.-Governor had now been settled at the Derwent for
four months, and as yet had only half his establishment with him.
The <i>Lady Nelson</i>, after landing the settlers and the
stores, had sailed for Port Jackson early in March, and before
the end of the month the <i>Ocean</i> had also left for Port
Phillip to bring Lieut. Sladden and the remainder of the people
[24th March.]. The <i>Ocean</i> might have been reasonably
expected to be back in a month at furthest; but week after week
went by, April and May had passed, June was well advanced, and
yet there was no sign of the missing vessel. The Governor grew
very anxious, and almost made up his mind to give her up for
lost. The Harbour Master was sent at intervals to Betsy's Island
to look out for her, but returned without news. At last, on the
22nd June, the Governor's fears were set at rest by her
appearance in the river. Lieut. Johnson landed, and reported that
they had been 33 days on the voyage, during which they had had
violent gales, the ship having been under bare poles for days at
a time, the captain hour by hour expecting her to founder. It
took her three days to come up the river, making her total
passage 36 days. The misery and semi-starvation of those wretched
five weeks, during which they were cooped up and tossed about in
that little vessel of 480 tons, were not soon forgotten by her
160 passengers. The live-stock brought in the <i>Ocean</i> also
suffered severely during the long rough passage, and Collins
ruefully enumerate the losses, which he could ill afford seeing
that the whole of the live-stock at the settlement at the end of
July consisted of only 20 head of cattle, 60 sheep, and some
pigs, goats, and poultry.</p>
<p>The reinforcement of people he had received now brought up the
strength of the Governor's establishment to 433
persons&mdash;viz., 358 men, 39 women, and 36 children.* The new
arrivals were temporarily distributed amongst the huts already
built, and the considerate Governor allowed them a few days'
exemption from work to enable them to build themselves houses. He
was so pleased with Lieut. Sladden's report of his little
detachment of marines that he issued a Garrison Order commending
them, and expressing his gratification at their soldier-like
demeanour. His civil staff was now complete. Mr. Leonard
Fosbrook, the Deputy Commissary-General, who had been left at
Port Phillip in charge of the stores and live stock, was
quartered in a marquee on Hunter's Island. Three magistrates were
appointed under a Commission from the Governor-General King. This
first Tasmanian Commission of the Peace consisted of the Rev.
Robert Knopwood, Lieut. Sladden, and Surveyor-General Harris. The
night watch was also re-organised, and placed under the direction
of Mr. Wm. Thos. Stocker, who in after years became a respected
citizen of Hobart as the proprietor of the best inn in the town,
the <i>Derwent Hotel</i>, situated in Elizabeth-street, on the
spot now occupied by Mr. Henry Cook's tailors' shop. Collins was
not altogether satisfied with this night watch, for he had to
complain of frequent robberies, which he characterised as a
disgrace to the settlement, and which he was of opinion could not
have been perpetrated if the watch had been properly vigilant.
Such irregularities were, no doubt, inevitable with the class of
people the Governor had to control; but, for all that, the
community, taking all things into consideration, seems to have
been fairly orderly and well-behaved, and to have been free from
the flagrant abuses and general demoralisation which disgraced
the early years of the Port Jackson settlement, and which
afterwards sprung up in this colony under less capable Governors
than Collins.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The return is printed in the Appendix. It
bears date July, 1804, and is, presumably, the record of the
muster taken about three weeks after the <i>Ocean</i>'s arrival,
and referred to in General Order, 17th July. It does not include
Lieut. Bowen's Risdon people, who were separately victualled. A
comparison of figures leads to the belief that it does include
the few prisoners selected from the Risdon establishment, and
whom Collins retained at the Derwent.]</p>
<p>That Collins must have had first-rate qualities as a ruler is
evidenced by the fact of the rapid progress made by the colony
during the first six months of its existence&mdash;from February
to the beginning of August&mdash;the time covered by the present
paper. When, on the 9th August, 1804, the <i>Ocean</i> sailed for
Port Jackson with Lieut. Bowen and the rest of the Risdon people,
whom the Governor was so glad to be rid of, the new settlement at
Sullivan's Cove was already organised, and with every prospect of
permanent success.</p>
<p>After the lapse of well nigh a century, we, the inhabitants of
the fair city which has arisen on the site of the Camp of 1804,
would show ourselves strangely unmindful of what we owe to the
past if we did not hold in honour the name of David Collins, and
if we failed to keep in grateful remembrance the sagacity and
energy which he, our first Lieut.-Governor, displayed in the
founding of Hobart, 85 years ago.</p>

<h3>THE EXPEDITION UNDER LIEUTENANT-<br>
GOVERNOR COLLINS, IN 1803-4.</h3>
<p align="center"><small>BY JAMES BACKHOUSE WALKER.<br>
<br>
Read 14th October, 1889.</small></p>
<br>
<a name="ch-19" id="ch-19"></a>
<h4>1. THE ORIGIN OF THE EXPEDITION AND THE VOYAGE TO PORT
PHILLIP.</h4>
<p><small>IN</small> former papers which I have had the honour to
read before the Royal Society, I have endeavoured to trace the
influence of French rivalry in hastening the English settlement
of Australia. I have shown that to the pioneer work of French
navigators we owe the first admirable surveys of the southern
coasts of Tasmania, and that it was wholly due to the
apprehensions that those surveys excited that Governor King sent
Lieut. Bowen from Port Jackson to take possession of the
Derwent.</p>
<p>I have also briefly touched on the explorations of our own
English sailors in the neighbourhood of the Derwent and in Bass'
Strait, and the influence of their reports in deciding the choice
of localities for new colonies, while I have followed the
misfortunes of the unlucky settlement at Risdon, and described
its collapse after a short and troubled life of little more than
half a year.</p>
<p>The real history of Tasmania as an English colony begins with
the departure from England, in the spring of 1803, of the
expedition of Lieut.-Governor Collins,* the founder of Hobart;
and it is with the origin and misadventures of that expedition on
its way to the Derwent that I have to deal in the present
paper.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The first lieutenant of the <i>Calcutta</i>
published a narrative of the voyage of the expedition to Port
Phillip, and of its failure there. "Account of a Voyage to
establish a Colony at Port Phillip, in Bass' Straits, in H.M.S.
<i>Calcutta</i>, in 1802-3-4. By James Kingston Tuckey." London,
1805.<br>
<br>
The principal official documents relating to the expedition down
to the date of its departure from Port Phillip, have been printed
by Mr. Francis Peter Labilliere, in his "Early History of the
Colony of Victoria", 2 vols., London, 1878, and also by Mr. James
Bonwick, in his "Port Phillip Settlement", London, 1883. The Rev.
Robert Knopwood's Diary has been printed by Mr. John J.
Shillinglaw in his "Early Historical Records of Port Phillip",
Melbourne, 1878; 2nd edition, 8vo., 1879. The diary was copied
from the original then in the possession of the late Mr. Vernon
W. Hookey, of Hobart.]</p>
<p>The project of the English Government to found a colony on the
shores of Bass' Strait, and the unsuccessful attempt of Governor
Collins to plant that settlement at Port Phillip in 1803, may at
first sight appear to be beyond the scope of the history of
Tasmania, and to belong exclusively to that of Victoria. But
Collins' expedition has absolutely nothing to do with the history
of our Victorian neighbours. The sandhills of Port Phillip merely
served for a month or two as a resting-place for the colonists on
their way to the Derwent. The short stay of Collins' people on
Victorian soil was only an incident in their passage from England
to Van Diemen's Land, like their touching at Rio or the Cape; and
the story of those months is an essential part of the history of
the first settlers of Hobart.</p>
<p>The idea of the settlement emanated from Captain Philip Gidley
King, the then Governor of New South Wales, and was, doubtless,
suggested to him by the arrival at Port Jackson of the French
ship the <i>Naturaliste</i> from Bass' Strait, and the suspicions
thus excited in his mind with respect to French designs on His
Majesty's territories in New Holland.</p>
<p>On the 21st May, 1802&mdash;shortly after the arrival of the
<i>Naturaliste</i>, but before Commodore Baudin's own ship had
reached Port Jackson&mdash;the Governor addressed a despatch to
the Duke of Portland pressing upon him the importance of founding
a colony at the newly-discovered harbour of Port Phillip, of the
soil, the climate, and advantageous position of which he had just
received a very favourable report from Captain Flinders, who had
explored it in the preceding month. The reason most strongly
urged by King was the necessity of being beforehand with the
French, who, in his opinion, were bent on getting a footing
somewhere in Bass' Straits.</p>
<p>When the Governor's despatch reached England there was for the
moment peace with France, but French movements were viewed with
the utmost suspicion, and a speedy renewal of the war was
regarded as inevitable. Home Office H.M.S. <i>Calcutta</i> was
under orders to take to New South Wales a further detachment of
400 male convicts and some 50 free settlers, and preparations
were being made to send her off immediately. King's
recommendation, therefore, came at an opportune juncture, and was
at once taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Amongst miscellaneous Colonial Office documents in the Record
Office, Mr. Bonwick found a paper which records the result of
these deliberations. It has neither superscription nor address,
and is undated, though from other evidence its date can be fixed
at somewhere in the latter half of the month of December,
1802.</p>
<p>This document is of so much interest as setting forth the
views of the Government on Australian colonisation at this
important period, that it is here given in full:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>"MEMORANDUM OF A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IN
BASS'S STRAIGHTS.</small></p>
<p>"The attention of the French Government has recently been
directed to New Holland, and two French ships have, during the
present year, been employed in surveying the western and southern
coasts, and in exploring the passage through Basses Straights to
New South Wales. By the accounts which have been recently
received from Governor King at Port Jackson, there is reason to
believe that the French navigators had not discovered either of
the two most important objects within those Straights, namely,
the capacious and secure harbour in the North, to which Governor
King has given the name of Port Phillip, nor a large island
called King's Island, situated nearly midway on the western side
of the Straights, and which extends about 50 miles in every
direction.</p>
<p>"Governor King represents each of these objects as deserving
the attention of Government, but especially Port Phillip, where
he urgently recommends that an Establishment should be
immediately formed, at the same time observing that, if the
resources of his Government could have furnished the means; he
should have thought it his duty, without waiting for
instructions, to have formed a settlement there.</p>
<p>"The reasons adduced by Governor King in support of this
opinion are principally drawn from the advantages which the
possession of such a port naturally suggests for the valuable
fishery that may be carried on in the Straights, where the seal
and the sea elephant abound, and from the policy of anticipating
the French, to whom our discovery of this port and of King's
Island must soon be known, and who may be stimulated to take
early measures for establishing themselves in positions so
favourable for interrupting in any future war the communication
between the United Kingdom and New South Wales, through the
channel of Basses Straight.</p>
<p>"In addition to these reasons, it may be stated that it would
be of material consequence to the settlement at Port Jackson,
which has now arrived to a population of near six thousand
persons, if an interval of some years were to be given for moral
improvement, which cannot, be expected to take place in any
material degree while there is an annual importation of convicts,
who necessarily carry with them those vicious habits which were
the cause of their having fallen under the sentence of the
law.</p>
<p>"From a due consideration of all these circumstances, it is
proposed to adopt the recommendation of Governor King, and to
appoint a competent person to proceed in the <i>Calcutta</i>,
direct for Port Phillip, for the purpose of commencing the
establishment there, by means of a certain number of settlers and
male convicts, now ready to be embarked in that ship, and,
further, that the establishment shall be placed under the control
of the principal Government at Port Jackson, upon a similar
footing to that on Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>"The expense of this new settlement, beyond what would
necessarily attend the conveyance and supplies for the convicts
if sent to Port Jackson, may be calculated at a sum not exceeding
&pound;15,000 a year, subject to a small additional charge, if
circumstances should render it advisable to send some of the
convicts under a sufficient guard to secure the possession of
King's Island.</p>
<p>"With a view to this service, and for the purpose of keeping
open the communication between the two settlements and with Port
Jackson, it is thought necessary that a small vessel should be
stationed in the Straights, to be employed in such manner as the
Lieut.-Governor, acting under the orders of Governor King, may
point out.</p>
<p>"Experience having proved the great inconvenience arising from
the establishment of the New South Wales Regiment at Port
Jackson, it is conceived, that considerable benefit would result
from selecting a detachment of the Royal Marines for this
service.</p>
<p>"With a view of exciting the convicts to good behaviour, it is
proposed that such of them as shall merit the recommendation of
the Governors abroad shall be informed that their wives and
families will be permitted to go to them at the public expense as
indentured servants; and, to render this act of humane policy as
conducive to the benefit of the Colony as the circumstances of
the case will permit, it will be necessary that these families
shall on no account be sent upon ships on which convicts shall be
embarked, and that they shall be informed their reunion with the
objects of their regard would depend upon their own good
behaviour, as well as upon that of their husbands."</p>
<p>The recommendations of the memorandum were adopted by the
Cabinet. Early in January, 1803, it was ordered that the
destination of the <i>Calcutta</i> should be changed, and that
the convicts, with a detachment of 100 Royal Marines as guard,
should proceed direct to Port Phillip, under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel David Collins, who was appointed Lieut.-Governor
of the new Settlement. An urgent appeal was made to the
authorities by Mr. Secretary King, of the Home Office, to send a
proportion of women&mdash;to allow the wives of the married
convicts to accompany their husbands, and to add a number of
female convicts. Secretary King pointed out the mischief that had
ensued in the Port Jackson colony from the disproportion of the
sexes, and remarked, "To begin with a colony of men, <i>populus
vivorum</i>, will do for nothing in nature but what Virgil
applies it to a Hive of Bees." It would have been well if this
sensible advice had been acted upon; as it was, out of 307
convicts who sailed from England, only 17 were accompanied by
their wives. The military guard, officers and men, consisted of
51, of whom some seven had their wives with them. Free settlers
were not much encouraged in those days; for, though it was the
policy of the Government to introduce a certain proportion, the
number was rigidly limited. Mr. Bonwick says that up to the year
1803 the whole number of free settlers introduced into New
Holland was only 320, to a total population of over 7000.
Thirteen persons obtained Lord Hobart's permission to throw in
their lot with the new colony as settlers; and, of these, not
more than three or four had wives with them. The Civil
Establishment consisted of a Chaplain, the Rev. Robert Knopwood;
three Surgeons, Messrs. Wm. F Anson, Matthew Bowden, and Wm.
Hopley; a Commissary, Mr. Leonard Fosbrook; a Surveyor, Mr.
George Prideaux Harris; a Mineralogist, Mr. Adolarius William
Henry Humphreys; and two Superintendents of Convicts.</p>
<p>The Colonial Office could probably have chosen no more
suitable man than Lieut.-Colonel David Collins as Governor of the
new settlement. Collins was an Irishman, having been born in
King's County in 1756. He had seen military service; and, as a
young Lieutenant of Marines, had been present at the battle of
Bunker's Hill. When Governor Phillip sailed with the "First
Fleet", in 1788, to found Sydney, Captain Collins accompanied
him, as Judge Advocate. He served in this important capacity, and
also as Secretary to the Governor, for eight years, returning to
England in 1796, with high recommendations from Governor Hunter
to the Duke of Portland for his merit and services to the young
colony. During his stay in England he wrote and published his
well-known and valuable "Account of the English Colony of New
South Wales", the first volume appearing in 1798, and the second,
which carried on the history to August, 1801, being published in
1802. The book met with a very favourable reception, and was
reviewed by Sydney Smith, in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. The
reviewer says, "Mr. Collins's book is written with great
plainness and candour; he appears to be a man always meaning
well; of good plain common sense; and composed of those
well-wearing materials which adapt a person for situations where
genius and refinement would only prove a source of misery and
error." Collins is said to have been a remarkably handsome man,
with delightful manners. He seems to have had not a little tact
in managing men, and to have possessed many of the qualities
requisite in the founder of a colony. If he erred in his judgment
of the capabilities of Victoria as a place for settlement, he
certainly showed sagacity in his choice of a site for Hobart.</p>
<p>The preparations for the new settlement were quickly pushed
on; and, in April, 1803, the expedition was ready for sea. The
307 male convicts, and their military guard, were to be conveyed
by H.M.S. <i>Calcutta</i>, in which vessel the Lieut.-Governor
himself, and a select few of his staff&mdash;viz., Lieut.
Sladden, the First Lieutenant of Marines; Mr. Knopwood, the
Chaplain; and Mr. I'Anson, the Principal Surgeon&mdash;were also
to be accommodated. At the period of which we are speaking, which
was during the short peace which followed upon the Treaty of
Amiens, the ships of the Navy were frequently employed for the
conveyance of convicts to New South Wales. In the early days of
the colony the convicts were brought out under
contract,&mdash;the contractors receiving as much as &pound;17
7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per head for all shipped. The contractors
had no interest in treating the people well, or even in keeping
them alive. The consequence was a most scandalous state of
things. It was estimated that during the first eight years at
least one-tenth of those transported died on the voyage. In the
"Second Fleet", in 1790, the mortality was awful. In one ship
more than a fourth part died on board, and a large number after
arrival. The unhappy people were shut up below, in filthy and
stifling quarters; seldom allowed on deck, for fear of mutiny;
kept under no discipline; and often subjected to brutal
ill-usage. Besides the dreadful mortality on the voyage, "the
survivors arrived so enfeebled that the hospitals were filled
with sick, many of whom succumbed; while a considerable
proportion of the remainder never recovered from the effects of
the passage. Afterwards, by the adoption of the system of paying
a premium for each person landed, thereby giving the contractors
a direct interest in caring for the health of the convicts, a
great improvement in their treatment was secured. During the
peace, however, the Government preferred using ships of the navy
as transports, thus giving employment to officers and seamen whom
it was undesirable to discharge, in view of a probable renewal of
hostilities, and at the same time ensuring that the convicts
would be kept in a better state of order and cleanliness. The
vessels could also, on their return voyage, bring home cargoes of
timber for naval purposes at a small expense. The ships best
adapted for transports were those which had been originally built
for the East India Company, and had been purchased into the
King's service during the war. The <i>Calcutta</i> was a ship of
this class. She was commanded by Captain Daniel Woodriff, who had
been in New South Wales in 1792 and 1793, and had been so
favourably impressed with the capabilities of the settlement
that, when he received orders to take out a transport, he
petitioned Lord Hobart for a grant of land for his sons, with the
view of settling his whole family in the colony. He had as his
first lieutenant Lieutenant Tuckey, a young Irishman of great
energy and ability, who afterwards wrote an account of the
expedition, which was published in 1805.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* "An Account of a Voyage to establish a Colony
at Port Phillip in Bass' Strait, on the South Coast of New South
Wales, in H.M.S. <i>Calcutta</i>". By Lieut. J. K. Tuckey.
London, 1805. Lieutenant James Kingston Tuckey was born in 1776,
at Mallow, County Cork. He entered the navy at an early age, and
served with distinction in the Eastern Archipelago and the Indian
Seas, and afterwards in the Red Sea. Broken in health, he was, in
1802, appointed first lieutenant of the <i>Calcutta</i>, and
served during the voyage to Port Phillip, returning to England in
1804, and publishing his book. In 1805 the <i>Calcutta</i>, in
convoying ships from St. Helena, was captured by the French,
after a gallant defence, in which Tuckey particularly
distinguished himself. He remained in a French prison for nine
years. During his imprisonment in France he married a lady who
was his fellow prisoner. On his release, in 1814, he was made
commander, and in 1316 he obtained the command of an expedition
to explore the River Congo. The members of the expedition
suffered terribly from fever, which was fatal to 21 out of a
total number of 66. Tuckey was one of the victims, dying on 4
October, 1816.&mdash;"Narrative of an Expedition to explore the
River Zaire (Congo) in South Africa in 1816." London, 1818.]</p>
<p>The <i>Calcutta</i> was to take the convicts and military; but
a tender was necessary to carry the stores for the whole
establishment. For this purpose the Transport Office chartered
the <i>Ocean</i>, a ship of 481 tons, belonging, to Mr. Hurris,
of Newcastle, and commanded by Captain John Mertho. The stores,
exclusive of provisions, amounted to the value of &pound;8047 *;
the freight and probable demurrage were put at &pound;2568;
total, &pound;10,615. The remainder of the civil establishment,
seven in number; two of the officers of the Royal Marines
(Lieuts. J. M. Johnson and Edward Lord); and the 13 free settlers
and their families, were passengers on board the
<i>Ocean</i>.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In the list of stores are the following
items:&mdash;Ironmongery, &pound;2525; clothing, &amp;c.,
&pound;1930; naval stores, &pound;723; carts and implements of
husbandry, &pound;500: medical and hospital stores, &pound;1380;
six pipes port wine, &pound;282.]</p>
<p>On Sunday, 24th April, 1803, the <i>Calcutta</i> and the
<i>Ocean</i> left Spithead in company, and three days later took
their final departure from the Isle of Wight. For the events of
the voyage Mr. Knopwood's diary is our principal source of
information.** The diary is taken for the most part from the
ship's log; and the chaplain, while he tells us a great deal
about the ports at which they touched, and about the dinners and
amusements which they enjoyed at those places, says nothing about
the condition of the convicts, and but little of the incidents of
the voyage. The ships touched at Teneriffe and at Rio de Janeiro,
where they stayed three weeks off the Island of Tristan d'Acunha
the <i>Ocean</i> was lost sight of in a storm, and the
<i>Calcutta</i> put into Simon's Bay, Cape of Good Hope, where
she remained a fortnight. The good chaplain was a man who dearly
loved good company and genial society, and from the fond way in
which he lingers over the delights of Rio and the Cape, at both
of which he managed to have a very good time, we can judge how
irksome he must have found the long sea life of five months.
Though well on in middle-age, he was still susceptible, for at
Rio he remarks of the Convent de Adjuda, which received as
boarders young ladies who had lost their parents:&mdash;"This I
frequently visited, where I conversed with a very beautiful young
lady named Antonia Januaria. Her polite attention I shall not
easily forget, having received great friendship from her, and
should I ever return there again shall be happy to see her." And
a few days later he writes:&mdash;"I visited De Adjuda for the
last time. I saw Antonia this eve at 5, and we took leave of each
other with regret. Vale!"</p>
<p class="foot">[** Mr. Labilliere discovered the log book of the
<i>Calcutta</i> at Deptford Dockyard, and gives extracts from it
in his book.]</p>
<p>It is so seldom that the chaplain indulges in sentiment that I
cannot forbear quoting his reflections on leaving the Cape. "On
our departure from the Cape", he writes, "it was natural for us
to indulge at this moment a melancholy reflection which obtruded
itself on the minds of those who were settlers at Port Phillip.
The land behind us was the abode of a civilised people&mdash;that
before us was the residence of savages. When, if ever, we might
again enjoy the commerce of the world was doubtful and uncertain.
The refreshments and the pleasures of which we had so liberally
partaken at the Cape and Simon's Bay were to be exchanged for
coarse fare and hard labour at Port Phillip, and we may truly
say, all communication with families and friends now cut off, we
were leaving the world behind us to enter on a state unknown."
After leaving the Cape the <i>Calcutta</i> encountered a severe
storm, and reached Port Phillip on the 9th October, where she
found the <i>Ocean</i> at anchor, shaving arrived two days before
her.</p>
<p>From the Chaplain's diary it appears that the voyage was
uneventful, and that good order was preserved throughout, for
there are only two or three entries of punishments, for trifling
offences. The health of the convicts must have been fairly looked
after, only four deaths from illness being noted and one from
drowning. This presents a pleasing contrast to the mortality and
ill-usage which had been too common in the transports to New
South Wales.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Lieut.-Governor Collins, in his despatch to
Governor King reporting his arrival, states that he had brought
with him 299 male convicts and 16 married women. Prom this it
would appear that 8 convicts and 1 convict's wife had died on the
voyage. It is difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the
varying statements contained in different documents with regard
to the number and names of the free settlers. In a despatch to
King, dated 16th December, 1803, Collins says that he has
eighteen free settlers with their families, yet his official
returns of 26th February and of July, 1804, show only thirteen at
the Derwent. We have a list of thirteen persons who had obtained
permission from Lord Hobart to accompany Collins' settlement, but
apparently this list does not contain the names of all who
eventually sailed with him. Thus, it omits the names of Messrs.
Pitt, Nicholls, Ingle, Dacres, and Blinkworth, who are known to
have come out with Collins to the Derwent as free settlers. The
<i>Calcutta</i>'s log records receiving on the 17th October six
passengers from the <i>Ocean</i> to proceed from Port Phillip to
Port Jackson. Deducting these from the total so far as known,
would leave the balance within one of the number given in
Collins' return.]</p>

<h4>2. THE PORT PHILLIP FAILURE.</h4>
<p>Collins' ships anchored within Port Phillip Heads about a mile
and a half to the eastward of the entrance. On the day of their
arrival the Lieut.-Governor and Capt. Woodriff went on shore.
They returned in the evening, having found no water, and reported
that the soil was very bad. The next morning they set off again
to look for a good spot for the settlement. They examined the
eastern shore for some miles as far as Arthur's Mount, and
although they found a small stream of fresh water, the soil was
so poor and sandy, and the shoal water made approach to the shore
so difficult that they returned to the ship much discouraged. The
next two days were spent in exploring the west side of the Bay
for a distance of many miles, but with no better result. The soil
was rather better, but there was no fresh water. In the words of
the Chaplain&mdash;"Along the shore we returned by no means
satisfied with the country." From this time Collins made up his
mind that Port Phillip was unsuited for settlement, and that his
stay could be only temporary, until some more favourable locality
were found elsewhere to which he could remove his people. For the
present, however, the necessity of immediately unloading his
ships was imperative. Capt. Woodriff had instructions to proceed
at once to Port Jackson to take in a cargo of timber; the
<i>Ocean</i> was bound for China, and could not be detained
without considerable expense. He therefore gave up further search
for a good locality, and, on the fourth day after his arrival,
fixed on a spot about eight miles to the eastward of the
Heads&mdash;near the present town of Sorrento&mdash;where very
good water had been got by sinking half a dozen casks in the
sand, and here, on a small flat of some 5 acres in extent, he
resolved to pitch his tents and encamp his people and stores. The
ships were moved opposite to the selected spot, the convicts and
military put on shore, the ground cleared, and the landing of the
stores begun. This was a task of some difficulty, as the men had
to go up to their middle through the water to carry in the goods
from the boats. The bulk of the stores were piled in the open
air, and the more valuable and perishable were placed in three
large tents, a guard of ten marines being posted to protect them.
This done, Lieut. Tuckey, accompanied by Mr. Surveyor Harris and
Mr. Wm. Collins, was sent in the <i>Calcutta</i>'s launch to
survey the upper part of the harbour. They proceeded to the
north-west, and after two attempts reached the head of the
Western Arm of Corio Bay, near to where Geelong now stands. The
report brought back was not encouraging. The soil was mostly
sandy, and, except a few acres at the head of the Port, there was
no land within five miles of the water which would grow corn.
Water was everywhere scarce. Snakes were common, and insects
innumerable and tormenting, but game was not plentiful, and fish
scarce. At the head of the Bay, where a level plain stretching to
the horizon appeared more promising, the blacks were numerous and
hostile. A mob of 200 attacked Tuckey's party, and were so
pertinacious and threatening that Tuckey had to fire upon them
with fatal effect.</p>
<p>It seemed to the Lieut.-Governor that any attempt to plant his
colony in this apparently more favourable situation, amidst
swarms of hostile savages, with his little military force of 40
men&mdash;already hardly sufficient to restrain the
convicts&mdash;must only end in disaster. He wrote to Lord
Hobart, "Were I to settle in the upper part of the harbour, which
is full of natives, I should require four times the strength I
have now." Yet this was the only alternative he could see to his
present position in a waste of waterless sand. So gloomy was the
view he took of the situation, that he even found the Bay itself
wholly unfit for commercial purposes on account of its difficulty
of access, and that, owing to the dangerous entrance and strong
tides, it required a combination of favourable circumstances to
enable a vessel to enter without disaster. His sole idea was to
remove as soon as possible from these forbidding shores. His
instructions from the Colonial Office had contemplated such a
possibility, and allowed him considerable latitude of choice as
to the final destination of the colony. "Although Port Phillip
has been pointed out as the place judged most convenient and
proper for fixing the first settlement of your establishment in
Bass' Straits, nevertheless, you are not positively restricted
from giving the preference to any other part of the said southern
coast of New South Wales, or any of the islands in Bass' Straits,
which, upon communication with the Governor of New South Wales,
and with his concurrence and approbation, you may have
well-grounded reasons to consider as more advantageously situated
for that purpose." With the idea, therefore, fixed in his mind
that at Port Phillip nothing but failure was possible, it became
his most anxious thought to obtain Governor King's permission to
remove his settlement. But here was a new source of
embarrassment.</p>
<p>By the beginning of November the <i>Ocean</i> had landed her
stores. Captain Mertho was anxious to proceed on his voyage to
China, and to charter the ship for Port Jackson would entail a
heavy expense. The Governor was anxious to detain the
<i>Calcutta</i> as long as he could, both for protection and to
be at hand to assist his removal if affairs took a more serious
turn. In this dilemma he found a friend in need in one of the
settlers, This William Collins, formerly a master in the navy,
who had come out in the <i>Ocean</i> on a seal-fishing
speculation. This William Collins volunteered to go to Port
Jackson in an open six-oared boat to carry despatches to Governor
King and to bring back his reply. Six convicts volunteered as a
crew,* the boat was victualled for a month, and on the 6th
November Mr. Collins started on his plucky trip. The surf was so
bad at the Rip that he could not get out of the entrance for four
days. A week later the <i>Ocean</i> was ready for sea, and sailed
out of Port Phillip on her way to China. She was, however,
destined to play a further part in the history of Tasmanian
colonisation. When within 60 miles of Port Jackson, Captain
Mertho came upon William Collins in his cutter. The boat had been
nine days at sea, and had had a very rough time of it. The
captain took the people on board and carried them to Sydney,
arriving on the 24th November, and the despatches were delivered
to Governor King. King acted promptly, the more so, as, from
Grimes' report, he was prepared for Collins' unfavourable account
of Port Phillip. The <i>Lady Nelson</i> was on the point of
sailing for Norfolk Island; he immediately changed her
destination, and sent her to Port Phillip with what little fresh
provisions and livestock he could spare, and with orders to
return with despatches. He wrote to Captain Woodriff, begging
him, if it was consistent with his instructions from the
Admiralty, to assist by removing the convicts to the Derwent or
Port Dalrymple; and, finally, he arranged with Captain Mertho for
a charter of the <i>Ocean</i> for four months, at 18<i>s</i>. per
ton per month, to proceed to Port Phillip to remove the stores.
The <i>Ocean</i> and <i>Lady Nelson</i> sailed within four days
after receipt of the despatches.</p>
<p class="foot">[* For this service the six men received
conditional pardons.]</p>
<p>Governor King, in his despatch, fully endorses Collins'
opinion about Port Phillip. "It appears," he says, "as well by
Mr. Grimes' and Mr. Robbins' surveys, as by your report, that
Port Phillip is totally unfit in every point of view to remain
at, without subjecting the Crown to the certain expensive
prospect of the soil not being equal to raise anything for the
support of the settlement, unless you shall have made any further
observations to encourage your remaining there. Perhaps the upper
part of the bay at the head of the rivers may not have escaped
your notice, as this is the only part Mr. Grimes and those that
were with him speak the least favourably of. From this
circumstance, I shall presume, it will appear to you that
removing from thence will be the most advisable for the interest
of His Majesty's Service." He then refers to Bowen's settlement
at Risdon, and the reports from thence, and sends to the
Lieut.-Governor Bass' and Flinders' MS. journals containing a
description of the Derwent. He next discusses the relative
advantages of the Derwent and Port Dalrymple (<i>i.e</i>., the
Tamar). The Derwent has the recommendation of being already
settled on a small scale, and as being an excellent harbour for
the China ships to touch at, and also for sealers and whalers.
However, if it were not for the difficulties of approach in the
channel of Port Dalrymple, and the possibility of not finding
good land there, he would decidedly prefer the northern locality,
as more advantageously situated, and particularly as a place of
resource for the sealing and fishing vessels in Bass' Straits and
to protect the fisheries at Cape Barren and King's Island from
the Americans. However, he leaves to Collins full freedom of
choice between the two places.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Governor Collins had got ail his people
encamped in tents, and had placed his sixteen settlers in a
valley near his encampment, where they established themselves in
temporary huts. For the first few weeks the general health was
good, but after that time sickness began to appear, and he had
some 30 under medical treatment. A matter which troubled Collins
more was the desertion of the convicts. The people had been very
orderly for the first three weeks, but soon a spirit of
discontent arose, and, immediately after the boat left for
Sydney, three men absconded,&mdash;with some vague idea of
reaching Port Jackson, or getting on board a whaler off the
coast,&mdash;and within a week twelve were missing from the camp.
Parties were organised in pursuit, and, at a distance of 60 miles
from the camp, five of the runaways were recaptured and brought
back. Hitherto the Governor had not caused his commission to be
read, reserving this ceremony till he should be finally settled.
Now he wished to make a public example of the delinquents; and,
to add solemnity to the punishment, he had the garrison drawn up
under arms, the convicts, clean dressed, on the opposite side,
while the chaplain read the commission, the marines fired three
volleys, and all gave three cheers for His Honor. The Governor
then addressed the people, pointing out the comforts they enjoyed
and the ill use they made of them, and the folly of desertion,
which could only end in suffering and death, either from the
attacks of the savages, or from starvation and hardships in the
fruitless attempt to travel 1000 miles through a wild and
inhospitable country inhabited only by savages. The five
deserters were then brought up for punishment, and, in the
presence of all, received 100 lashes each, administered by the
drummers. Notwithstanding this example, desertions still
continued in spite of all the vigilance that could be exercised.
Some of the runaways, after a bitter experience of the miseries
of the bush, voluntarily returned, in a deplorable state of
illness and exhaustion, having travelled over 100 miles and
subsisted on gum and shellfish. One or two were shot, others were
recaptured, but on Collins' departure at least seven were left in
the woods. What became of them was never known, except in one
instance. Thirty years after, when the first party from
Launceston went over to settle Port Phillip, they found amongst a
tribe of blacks a white man, unable to speak English, and hardly
distinguishable from an aborigine. This was William Buckley, one
of the runaways from Collins' settlement. Buckley received a free
pardon and settled in Tasmania. His huge ungainly form and heavy
face were familiar in the streets of Hobart in the memory of many
now living.</p>
<p>Considering the character of the people, and the fact that
they were broiling on the sandhills in a Victorian summer, with
an insufficient supply of water, and unemployed on any useful
work, it is not to be wondered that disorder broke out in the
camp. From Collins' General Orders, and Mr. Knopwood's diary, we
learn of drunkenness amongst the marines, of plundering of the
stores by the convicts. After some particularly daring robberies
on Christmas eve, it was found that the military guard was
insufficient, and, by the Governor's desire, the officers of the
civil establishment, including the chaplain, formed themselves
into an association to patrol as a watch at night for the
protection of property and the maintenance of order.</p>
<p>The Governor did his best to find employment for his men by
setting them to build huts, and to construct a stone magazine for
ammunition, but he made no further effort at exploration, nor did
he attend to King's hint that better country might be found at
the head of the port. If he had done so, it is probable that the
systematic settlement of Hobart might have been long deferred. It
is the more inexplicable that the country on which Melbourne now
stands was not examined, as the <i>Calcutta</i> proceeded up the
Harbour and anchored in Hobson's Bay off the present site of
Williamstown, actually taking in 55 tons of water from the River
Yarra. Yet, although the ship was away for some ten days, no
attempt was made to explore the shores of that river.</p>
<p>On the 13th December the <i>Ocean</i> returned from Port
Jackson, and with her the <i>Francis</i> schooner, bringing
despatches from Governor King. The appearance of the <i>Ocean</i>
was hailed with delight, and the satisfaction of Collins was
shared by all when they learnt the news of Bowen's settlement at
the Derwent, and that the <i>Ocean</i> had been chartered to
remove the people thither, or wherever the Lieut.-Governor
thought proper. Collins' pleasure was rather damped by Capt.
Woodriff's informing him that, as the <i>Ocean</i> had arrived to
remove the colony, the <i>Calcutta</i>, in accordance with the
Admiralty instructions, must immediately proceed to Port Jackson,
where a cargo of timber for the use of the navy was awaiting her,
and that she could give no assistance in removing the settlement.
This would render it necessary to divide the convicts, the
military and civil establishments, and the stores into two
detachments, as the <i>Ocean</i> could not take them all at
once.</p>
<p>Collins immediately set to work to prepare for removal. He set
the people to build a temporary jetty, 500 feet long, over the
flats, and soon had all hands busily at work loading the
<i>Ocean</i>. As to his ultimate destination he was still in much
perplexity, and for some weeks it was doubtful whether the Tamar
or the Derwent would be the site of the principal settlement in
Van Diemen's Land. Indeed, in those days the ignorance of the
different localities was so great&mdash;being limited to the
information acquired by Flinders in his flying visits&mdash;that
the data upon which to base a decision were wanting. By the
<i>Calcutta</i>, which left him on the 18th December, he writes
to King that he will not come to a decision on a point of so much
importance until Port Dalrymple had been examined by Wm. Collins,
who was leaving in the <i>Francis</i> for that purpose. He will,
in deference to King, give the northern port the preference,
though he himself inclined to the Derwent. King, in reply, tells
him that a schooner which had just arrived from Port Dalrymple
reported the entrance and channel very dangerous, and the natives
troublesome, and advises him to give up the idea of going there,
and to decide for the Derwent.</p>
<p>This advice only confirmed the conclusion to which Collins had
at last brought himself. He gives as his reasons, in addition to
King's recommendation, that the advantages of being in a place
already settled had great weight with him, but that a stronger
consideration was the mutinous spirit amongst his soldiers,
which, he thought, would be checked by the presence of the
detachment of the New South Wales Corps at Risdon; and, moreover,
that he considered the Derwent better for commercial purposes
than any place in the Straits, and that he hoped before long to
see it a port of shelter for ships from Europe, America, and
China, and a favourite resort of whaling ships.</p>
<p>The Lieut.-Governor was so anxious to get away from the place
he detested that he kept his people at work loading the
<i>Ocean</i> all the week round, Sundays included. He says, in
his General Order of Sunday, 31st December, "It has never been
the Lieut.-Governor's wish to make that day any other than a day
of devotion and rest; but circumstances compel him to employ it
in labour. In this the whole are concerned, since the sooner we
are enabled to leave this unpromising and unproductive country,
the sooner we shall be able to reap the advantages and enjoy the
comforts of a more fertile spot; and as the winter season will
soon not be far distant, there will not be too much time before
us wherein to erect more comfortable dwellings for every one than
the thin canvas coverings which we are now under, and which are
every day growing worse."</p>
<p>When Wm. Collins, on 21st January, returned from Port
Dalrymple in the <i>Lady Nelson</i>&mdash;which vessel had taken
him from Kent's Group, the <i>Francis</i> having proved too leaky
to venture across the Straits&mdash;he found the <i>Ocean</i>
loaded and ready to go to the Derwent. The fact that he brought a
report on the whole very favourable to Port Dalrymple did not
induce the Lieut-Governor to alter his mind.</p>
<p>A few days sufficed to select the people he intended to leave
behind him, some 150 in number, of whom Lieut. Sladden, with a
small guard, was to have charge, and to embark the majority, some
200 souls, on board the <i>Ocean</i>, the settlers finding a
place on board the <i>Lady Nelson</i>. On the 27th January,
Collins writes to King that he was now only waiting for an
easterly wind to clear the Heads and leave this inhospitable land
behind. They had to wait four days for the wind; and, on the 30th
January, 1804, the <i>Ocean</i> and <i>Lady Nelson</i> sailed out
of Port Phillip in company, and headed for the Derwent.</p>
<p>In his narrative of Collins' expedition, Lieut. Tuckey says of
the country he had just left: "The kangaroo seems to reign
undisturbed lord of the soil, a dominion which, by the evacuation
of Port Phillip, he is likely to retain for ages."&mdash;Surely
as unlucky an attempt at prophecy as was ever made!</p>
<p>Could some truer prophet have lifted the veil of the future
for Collins, he would have shown the disappointed Lieut.-Governor
a picture which would have more than surprised him. He would have
shown him, within little more than thirty years, a small party of
adventurous squatters leaving Van Diemen's Land to seek a new
land of wealth on the shores of Port Phillip. Amongst them he
would have noticed a man&mdash;whom he himself had brought out as
a boy in the <i>Ocean</i>, and taken to the Derwent,* and who was
now returning to the unpromising and unproductive country which
the Lieut.-Governor had abandoned in despair, to find in it a
land of fair plains and of springs of water&mdash;a land of
promise&mdash;a veritable Australia Felix&mdash;soon to be
wealthy in flocks and herds. Such a prophet would have shown him
this country, which he and Governor King agreed in thinking
wholly unsuited for settlement, within another fifteen short
years invaded by tens of thousands of eager emigrants, rushing to
secure at least some small share of its wonderful wealth, until
in another generation it had grown into a land of gardens and
farms, rich in corn and wine, crowded with villages and cities;
and on the unpromising shores of Port Phillip there stood a great
city, the centre of a free and prosperous state numbering more
than a million souls.</p>

<h3>THE DISCOVERY AND OCCUPATION OF PORT DALRYMPLE.</h3>
<p align="center"><small>BY JAMES BACKHOUSE WALKER.</small></p>
<a name="ch-22" id="ch-22"></a>
<h4>I. THE DISCOVERY.</h4>
<p>It is a fact, often forgotten, that an interval of a century
and a half separated the discovery of the eastern coast of
Australia from that of her western shores. The western coast was
visited by the Dutch in the early part of the 17th century. It
was not until the last half of the 18th that the eastern coast
was first seen by European eyes. The discovery of Southern
Tasmania belongs to the old period&mdash;to the days of the Dutch
East India Company, and of Tasman's search for the Great South
Land&mdash;to the days when New Holland had an evil reputation as
the most forbidding and inhospitable country on the face of the
earth. The discovery of our northern coast was one of the last of
the modern epoch, when English navigators had laid open to the
world the rich promise of the fertile lands of Eastern Australia,
and when the first of the great English southern colonies had
already been planted at Port Jackson.</p>
<p>A short sketch of the exploration of the Straits, and
particularly Port Dalrymple, although it may traverse some ground
already touched upon in former papers, may prove of interest as
an introduction to the story of the settlement of Northern
Tasmania. Such a sketch will serve to bring into due prominence
the achievements of two men, whose names should be held in honour
by every Tasmanian, as practically the discoverers of our island
home, and the pioneers who opened it for English colonisation.
These two men were George Bass and Matthew Flinders.</p>
<p>I trust, therefore, that my readers will forgive my detaining
them for a time from the settlement of Port Dalrymple by a
prefatory history of the events which led to its discovery.</p>
<p>The existence of a great southern continent surrounding the
Antarctic Pole, and pushing itself northward far into the Pacific
Ocean, was a fixed belief of the old geographers. The hope of
discovering such a continent prompted not only the voyage of Abel
Tasman towards the unknown South Land in 1642, when he discovered
the southern coast of Van Diemen's Land, but many another
expedition of the old navigators. As is well known, Captain
Cook's first voyage in the <i>Endeavour</i>, in 1768, was
undertaken for the purpose of observing the transit of Venus from
a station in the South Seas. But when the observations had been
made, Cook, in accordance with his instructions, headed the
<i>Endeavour</i> from Tahiti to the far south, to make one more
effort to solve the old geographical problem. After reaching lat.
40&deg; S. without seeing any sign of land, he turned north, and
then west, until he sighted what he at first took for the
long-sought Terra Australis Incognita. It is scarcely necessary
to say that this was the east coast of New Zealand. After
circumnavigating the islands, in March, 1770, the question arose
as to the homeward route. Cook himself had a strong desire to
return by Cape Horn, in order finally to determine whether there
was or was not a continent in that direction. As, however, winter
was approaching, it was thought inadvisable to venture into the
stormy seas of those high latitudes. It was resolved, therefore,
to return by the East Indies, and, with this view, to sail
westward until they should fall in with the undiscovered east
coast of New Holland, and then follow that coast to its northern
extremity. The <i>Endeavour</i> took her departure from Cape
Farewell, and, on 19th April, 1770, sighted land at Point Hicks,
about 60 miles westward of Cape Howe. Cook had expected to see
the coast of Tasman's Van Diemen's Land to the south, and from
the sudden falling of the sea, concluded that it was not far off,
but was not able to determine whether it was joined to New
Holland or not. From Point Hicks he sailed north, exploring the
whole length of the eastern coast, which he named New South
Wales, until he reached its northern extremity at Cape York, and
returned home by Torres Straits.</p>
<p>Two years later, Cook sailed on his second voyage in the
<i>Resolution</i>. He was accompanied by the <i>Adventure</i>,
commanded by Capt. Tobias Furneaux. The ships were separated in a
fog in 50&deg; S. lat., between the Cape and New Zealand, and
Furneaux shaped his course for the land marked on the charts as
Van Diemen's Land, which he sighted on 5th March, 1773. After a
short stay, he sailed out of Adventure Bay with the intention of
exploring the east coast as far as Point Hicks, Cook's most
southern point, in order to discover whether the coast of Van
Diemen's Land was joined to that of New Holland. The
<i>Adventure</i> sailed northwards till land was lost sight of, a
little to the north of the Furneaux Group, but, continuing a
northerly course, Furneaux saw, or fancied he saw, land again in
about lat. 39&deg;. Here the soundings indicated the presence of
shoals, and, thinking the navigation too dangerous, he stood away
for New Zealand. His conclusion is thus expressed: "It is my
opinion that there is no strait between New Holland and Van
Diemen's Land, but a very deep bay."</p>
<p>No further exploration in that direction took place before the
settlement of Port Jackson in 1788, and for years subsequently
the resources of the new colony were too limited to allow of more
than boat expeditions to short distances from the Sydney
Heads.</p>
<p>In June, 1797, however, the wreck of a vessel named the
<i>Sydney Cove</i>, on Cape Barren Island, in the Furneaux Group,
led to the despatch of the colonial schooner <i>Francis</i> to
the scene of the wreck. The trips of the <i>Francis</i> not only
extended geographical knowledge, but aroused a keen interest in
the locality, as the seat of a most lucrative seal fishery.</p>
<p>Just at this time H.M.S. <i>Reliance</i> arrived at Port
Jackson from the Cape of Good Hope, with a cargo of cattle. She
was in a very leaky condition, and had to be detained for
extensive repairs. Amongst her officers were two eager and
adventurous spirits, her Second Lieut., Matthew Flinders, and her
Surgeon, George Bass They were both young&mdash;Flinders was
23&mdash;both ardent, and full of zeal for exploration. On a
previous voyage of the <i>Reliance</i> they had made a daring
expedition down the coast in a boat only 8 feet long, and Bass
had travelled inland to try to cross the Blue Mountains. On this
occasion Flinders could not leave his ship, but Bass, tired of
inaction, prevailed on Governor Hunter to lend him a whaleboat
for a more extended voyage. The Governor gave him a boat, six
weeks' provisions, and a crew of six seamen from the King's
ships. In this whaleboat Bass made his way down the coast,
examining the inlets and harbours, and battling with head winds
and gales, for a distance of more than 600 miles. Rounding Cape
Howe, and passing Cook's furthest point (Cape Hicks), he sighted
the high land afterwards known as Wilson's Promontory, but the
contrary winds preventing him from reaching it, he stood across
for the Furneaux Islands, where he hoped to replenish his stock
of provisions. The wind, however, now drove him to the
south-west, and as the gale and sea increased, the water rushed
in fast through the boat's side, and he was obliged to go on the
other tack. After a time of considerable danger, he once more
reached the Promontory, this time on the west side, and,
proceeding along the coast, discovered and entered Western Port.
He was detained in the Port for a fortnight by contrary gales,
and, as the seventh week of absence from Port Jackson had
expired, want of provisions forced him very reluctantly to turn
the boat's head homeward. On his way back, he examined Wilson's,
Promontory, and came to the conclusion from various indications
that there must be a strait between Van Diemen's Land and the
mainland. He found that the flood-tide swept westward past the
Promontory at the rate of two or three miles an hour, the ebb
setting to the eastward. "Whenever it shall be decided", he says
in his journal, "that the opening between this and Van Diemen's
Land is a <i>strait</i>, this rapidity of tide, and the long
south-west swell that seems to be continually rolling in upon the
coast to the westward, will then be accounted for." Strong
contrary gales delayed Bass on his homeward voyage, and it was
not until after an absence of 12 weeks, during a great part of
which he and his crew had subsisted chiefly on mutton-birds, that
he returned to Port Jackson, and reported his discoveries to
Governor Hunter.</p>
<p>The Governor, in his despatch to the Duke of Portland, says
that Bass "found an open ocean westward, and, by the mountainous
sea which rolled from that quarter, and no land discoverable in
that direction, we have much reason to conclude that there is an
open strait through, between the latitude of 39&deg; and 40&deg;
12' S., a circumstance which, from many observations made upon
tides and currents, I had long conjectured . . . I presume it
will appear that the land called Van Diemen's, and generally
supposed to be the southern promontory of this colony, is a group
of islands separated from its southern coast by a strait, which,
it is probable, may not be of narrow limits, but may, perhaps, be
divided into two or more channels by the islands near that on
which the <i>Sydney Cove</i> was wrecked."</p>
<p>During Bass' absence in the whaleboat, the <i>Francis</i> was
again sent to the wreck, and this time Flinders accompanied her.
The schooner went as far south as the entrance of Banks' Strait,
and Flinders got his first sight of the north coast of Van
Diemen's Land. The smoke rising from the land showed that there
were inhabitants on it, and as there were none on the adjoining
islands, Flinders was Shaken in his belief in the existence of a
strait, for he could not understand how, unless by a connecting
isthmus, men could have reached the more distant Van Diemen's
Land, and yet failed to have attained the intervening islands,
more especially as those islands were so abundantly supplied with
birds and other food.</p>
<p>When Flinders met Bass in Sydney, and heard of his
observations at Wilson's Promontory, he declared that there
wanted no other proof of the existence of a strait than that of
sailing positively through it; and this the two friends now
anxiously waited for an opportunity to do. Their professional
duties, however, delayed the execution of the project, but, six
months later, when the <i>Reliance</i> returned from her voyage
to Norfolk Island, Flinders explained his views to Governor
Hunter, and the Governor gave him the <i>Norfolk</i>, a sloop of
25 tons, with a crew of eight volunteers, to attempt the
circumnavigation of Van Diemen's Land. This voyage was briefly
mentioned in a former paper, and it is not now necessary to
follow it in detail, except so far as concerns our immediate
subject, the discovery of Port Dalrymple. On the 7th October,
1798, Flinders and Bass sailed in their tiny vessel on their now
famous voyage. Their first point was Cape Barren Island, and
thence they sailed through Banks' Strait, and proceeded along the
north coast of Tasmania. On the 3rd November, at two o'clock in
the afternoon, Flinders saw with great interest indications of an
opening in the land, and bore tide, and, rounding a low head,
entered a broad inlet. Sailing up this inlet some three miles,
they passed a low green island, when suddenly the sloop grounded.
Fortunately, the ground was soft, the strong flood dragged the
sloop over into deep water, and drove her rapidly onward, till
the harbour suddenly expanded into a broad and beautiful basin,
on which swam numbers of black swans, ducks, and wild fowl. Its
shores were broken into points and projections, covered with wood
and grass down to the water's edge,&mdash;a strong contrast to
the rocky and sterile banks observed in sailing up Port Jackson.
There appeared to be three arms or rivers discharging themselves
into this extensive basin, and, as evening was coming on, the
sloop was anchored near to the mouth of the western arm. Flinders
was greatly pleased with his discovery, to which Governor Hunter
gave the name of Port Dalrymple, in compliment to Alexander
Dalrymple, the well-known Hydrographer to the Admiralty. He
employed 16 days in examining the place, explored Western and
Middle Arms, worked his way up Whirlpool Reach, and got as far as
Shoal Point and Crescent Shore, when, although he believed that
half the river was still unexplored, the limited time allowed him
compelled his return. The <i>Norfolk</i> took her departure from
Low Head, and, sailing along the north coast, rounded Cape Grim,
her commander finally settling the problem of the insularity of
Van Diemen's Land by his circumnavigation.</p>
<p>The importance of the discovery was at once recognised in
England; and early in 1800 the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, a brig of 60
tons, was fitted out and despatched under Lieut. Grant to examine
the new strait. It was, however, left to Flinders himself, in the
<i>Investigator</i>, two years later, to complete his own work by
making the first reliable survey of its northern shores.</p>
<p>As we have already seen, the discovery of Bass Strait, and the
possible colour it might give to French claims to the island,
were among the causes which prompted King's hasty occupation of
the Derwent by Bowen in 1803; and it was owing to King's urgent
representations of the importance of forming settlements in the
Straits, to assist the seal fisheries, and anticipate the French,
that Governor Collins' expedition was despatched to Port Phillip.
When Governor Collins found his position at Port Phillip
untenable, he was doubtful whether he should not remove his
people to Port Dalrymple rather than to the Derwent. Governor
King was also, in the first instance, strongly in favour of the
northern locality, considering it more advantageously situated
for the principal settlement in Van Diemen's Land, chiefly on
account of the protection it would afford to English sealers in
the Straits from the attacks of American interlopers. His only
doubt was whether the soil was as good as that on the Derwent,
and whether the entrance to the port was not too dangerous. To
enable Governor Collins to satisfy himself on these points, he
sent the schooner <i>Francis</i> to Port Phillip to serve as a
surveying vessel. She was in a very leaky condition, and though
they tried to patch her up at Port Phillip, and sent her, with
William Collins Clark, the agricultural superintendent, and
Humphreys, the mineralogist, to make an examination of Port
Dalrymple, she proved so unseaworthy that William Collins had to
send her back to Sydney, and complete his voyage in the <i>Lady
Nelson</i>, which he fell in with at Kent's Group.</p>
<p>The <i>Lady Nelson</i> entered Port Dalrymple on New Year's
Day, 1804. William Collins immediately proceeded with his
examination. The <i>Lady Nelson</i> anchored above Upper Island
(now Pig Island), and from thence the examination of the yet
unvisited portion of the river was made in a boat. William
Collins was delighted with the appearance of the country about
the present site of Launceston, diversified with hill and plain,
with good land both for pasture and agriculture. He went some
distance up the Main River (North Esk), and found excellent land.
Then he entered the Cataract Gorge. Grand as its towering rocks
are now, the Gorge in its natural state, when clothed with the
wild beauty of its native bush, and full of wild fowl, must have
been magnificent. William Collins says of it: "The beauty of the
scene is probably not surpassed in the world. The great
waterfall, or cataract, is most likely one of the greatest
sources of this beautiful river, every part of which abounds with
swans, ducks, and other kinds of wild fowl. On the whole, I think
the River Dalrymple possesses a number of local advantages
requisite for a settlement."</p>
<p>Collins had been 18 days in Port Dalrymple, and was anxious to
get back to the Lieut.-Governor with his good news. A fair wind
carried the <i>Lady Nelson</i> across the Straits in two days,
and, on the 21st January, Lieutenant Symons brought his ship to
an anchor off the Camp, inside Port Phillip Heads. The Camp was a
scene of busy activity, and when Wm. Collins landed to present
his report, he found that the Lieutenant-Governor had at last
made up his hesitating mind, and that the establishment was on
the point of sailing to the Derwent. It so happened that Governor
King had heard such a bad account from the captain of a schooner
which had touched at Port Dalrymple for water, who painted such a
picture of the dangers of the entrance and the hostile attitude
of the blacks, that he had written, advising Collins to give up
all idea of the northern port. The Lieutenant-Governor, therefore
had the satisfaction; before sailing, of having his superior
officer's approval of his final choice.</p>
<p>The reports of the explorers had now lost their immediate
interest, and the Lieutenant-Governor forwarded them to King with
the despatch announcing his departure.</p>
<br>
<a name="ch-23" id="ch-23"></a>
<h4>II. THE OCCUPATION OF THE TAMAR.</h4>
<p>Possibly, Governor King, if left to himself, would have been
contented, at least for a time, with the establishment of the
Colony at the Derwent as a sufficient safeguard against French
designs. But the apprehensions of the Home Government had been
thoroughly aroused by the Governor's despatches pressing the
urgent necessity of occupying certain points in Bass Straits and
Van Diemen's Land to prevent the probable intrusion of French
claims to the territory. In was the consideration of these
despatches which had led to the writing of the Minute of
December, 1802, quoted in a former paper, and to the sending of
Governor Collins to Port Phillip with instructions to place a
post on King Island also. The Cabinet, however, was not yet
satisfied with the precautions taken, and six months later, Lord
Hobart addressed a despatch * (24th June, 1803, p. 429) to
Governor King, in the following terms:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* As an instance of the roundabout way in which
even important Government Despatches reached the Colony in those
days, it may be mentioned that Lord Hobart's despatch was landed
at Norfolk Island by the <i>Adornis</i> whaler, and brought
thence to Port Jackson by the <i>Alexander</i> whaler.]</p>
<p>"It appears to be advisable that a part of the establishment
now at Norfolk Island should be removed, together with a
proportion of the settlers and convicts, to Port Dalrymple, the
advantageous position of which, upon the <i>southern</i> coast of
Van Diemen's Land, and near the <i>eastern</i> entrance of Bass'
Streights, renders it, in a political view, peculiarly necessary
that a settlement should be formed there, and, as far as the
reports of those who have visited that coast can be depended
upon, it is strongly recommended by the nature of the soil and
the goodness of the climate."</p>
<p>The despatch proceeded to designate Lieutenant Colonel Wm.
Paterson, of the New South Wales Corps. Lieutenant-Governor under
Governor King, as the Administrator of the new Colony, at a
salary of &pound;250 a year.</p>
<p>Lord Hobart's despatch was very perplexing to King. The
direction to occupy Port Dalrymple was too positive to be
disregarded, and yet the grotesquely inaccurate description of
Port Dalrymple as on the <i>southern</i> ** coast of Van Diemen's
Land, and near the <i>eastern</i> entrance of Bass Straits,
introduced an element of uncertainty that threw him into a
difficulty as to his course of action. It was probable that Lord
Hobart's directions were the result of a despatch of his own,
dated 23rd November, 1802, in which he had strongly urged a
settlement at Storm Bay Passage, Port Phillip, or King's Island,
to counteract any intention of the French intruding a claim
within the limits of his government. But, if so, it might be
"respectfully presumed" that a mistake had been made in naming
Port Dalrymple as on the south coast of Van Diemen's Land, and
then the inference was that Storm Bay Passage was really
intended. If this construction were right, then Colonel Collins'
removal to the Derwent had anticipated the Minister's wishes.
Furthermore, as Lord Hobart, when writing, had supposed Port
Phillip to be already occupied by Collins, would his commands be
best fulfilled by settling Port Dalrymple or re-settling Port
Phillip? Or, if the despatch were literally obeyed, and Port
Dalrymple occupied, would it not be advisable to send, also, a
small post to Port Phillip or Western Port?</p>
<p class="foot">[** It does not seem to have struck King that
"southern" was probably merely a clerical error for "northern".
In fact, this is the only possible explanation.]</p>
<p>The Governor propounded these questions to his principal
officers, Lieutenant-Governor Colonel Paterson and Major
Johnston, of the New South Wales Corps, for their consideration
and advice. They were unanimously of opinion that the commands of
the Secretary of State to occupy Port Dalrymple, "with a
political view", were too explicit and peremptory to admit of
hesitation, and that they must be immediately carried into
effect. They thought that the north side of the Straits should
also be occupied, and a post established either at Port Phillip
or Western Port, whichever might be found the more eligible
situation. They recommended that Colonel Paterson should
forthwith be despatched to Port Dalrymple with a small
establishment, and a guard of not less than 20 soldiers.</p>
<p>Having thus settled his course of action, the Governor lost no
time in taking steps to send a force to occupy the post, pending
the transference of the colonists from Norfolk Island. The armed
colonial cutter <i>Integrity</i>, 56 tons, was at once fitted for
sea, and a small private vessel of 25 tons, called the
<i>Contest</i>, was chartered to assist. The two ships were to
take 20 convicts and a force of 34 soldiers, in all 56 persons.
On the morning of the 7th June, the New South Wales Corps was
drawn up on the Government wharf as a guard of honour, and
Lieutenant-Governor Paterson embarked in the pinnace to go on
board his vessel. The pinnace left the wharf, the battery fired a
salute, and, to quote the reporter of the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>,
"the most animated acclamations issued from the shore", as the
new Lieutenant-Governor set out to found another British
Colony&mdash;or, rather, to attempt to found it&mdash;for the
same fate which befell the first attempt to found the Derwent
Settlement attended that to the Tamar. It was now the depth of
winter, and storms such as had driven back Lieutenant Bowen on
his attempt to reach the Derwent, just twelve months before, met
the ships at the entrance to Bass Straits. The <i>Integrity</i>,
on rounding Cape Howe, battled in vain against the strong
westerly winds which prevailed in the Straits, and had to put
back to Port Jackson, which she reached on 21st June,* her
passengers all ill, in consequence of being battened down in the
hold. The Contest, after beating about for a month, had to follow
her consort's example. King was much disappointed, and made
offers to the masters of two East India Company's ships then in
harbour to take Paterson and his people to their destination,
offers which their charter parties prevented them from accepting.
There was, therefore, no alternative but to delay the expedition
until the approach of spring, when H.M.S. <i>Buffalo</i> would be
available for the service required.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Paterson, in his despatch to Lord Camden, 14th
November, 1805, says he arrived in Port Jackson 17th June, 1804,
but this is probably an error.]</p>
<p>During the interval between the return of the <i>Integrity</i>
and the departure of the <i>Buffalo</i>, a question of some
difficulty arose respecting Paterson's relations to the
Lieut.-Governor at the Derwent. Colonel Collins claimed that his
appointment as Lieutenant-Governor extended to the whole of Van
Diemen's Land, that the northern settlement was, therefore,
within his jurisdiction, and Paterson under his command. This
claim Paterson wholly repudiated. He contended that he had
received an appointment from the King as Lieutenant-Governor of
Port Dalrymple at a time when Collins was supposed to be at Port
Phillip; that, consequently, his command was wholly independent
of Collins, and he absolutely refused to tolerate any
interference by the Lieut.-Governor at the Derwent with him or
his settlement. Governor King admitted the cogency of Paterson's
argument, and issued a General Order, dividing the island into
two independent governments, to be known respectively as the
Counties of Buckingham and Cornwall, the dividing-line to be the
42nd parallel of south latitude, each government to be
subordinate only to himself as Governor-in-Chief of New South
Wales and its dependencies.</p>
<p>Governor King's instructions to the new Lieut.-Governor
present curious matter for study. We may pass over the usual
directions as to the treatment of the aborigines, the
investigation of the products of the country, the care of
clothing, stores, and live stock, the oversight of the convicts,
the regulations for the occupation of lands and their
cultivation, religious worship, and so forth. But there are other
features in the instructions which present a very striking
contrast to what would, in these days, be thought proper to
inculcate on the founder of a new colony. It must never be
forgotten that these early establishments were not colonies at
all in the modern sense, but military posts, established for
political purposes, in which a limited number of convicts were
utilised to provide the labour necessary for their maintenance.
Instead, therefore, of encouraging trade and settlement, every
possible precaution was taken to ensure the most complete
isolation. This had the double object of keeping out foreign
intruders and guarding against the escape of the convicts.
Paterson was expressly enjoined to take particular care that all
communication with the East India Company's possessions, with
China, or with the islands visited by any European nation, should
be rigorously interdicted, or only allowed on the special
authorisation of the Indian Government. No craft of any sort was
to be built by any private person without a written licence from
the Governor in Sydney. No intercourse was to be permitted
between persons arriving in any vessel and the inhabitants of the
settlement without the Lieut.-Governor's special permission. The
American sealers who had given so much trouble to King had been
building vessels from the wrecks of the Sydney Cove and other
ships. These, if met with, were to be seized by putting the
King's mark upon them. The introduction and sale of spirits by
private persons was prohibited, and any which were introduced
were to be seized and destroyed.</p>
<p>By the end of September, H.M.S. <i>Buffalo</i> was fitted and
ready for sea. The armed tender <i>Lady Nelson</i> and the
Colonial schooners <i>Francis</i> and <i>Integrity</i> were to
accompany her, and assist in conveying the people and stores to
the new colony. Paterson's establishment consisted of Dr. Jacob
Mountgarrett (who had come up with Lieut. Bowen in the
<i>Ocean</i> on 24th August, and on leaving Risdon had received
the appointment of Surgeon); Mr. Alexr. Riley, Storekeeper, at a
salary of 5<i>s</i>. per day; Capt. Anthony Fenn Kemp, Ensigns
Hugh Piper and Anderson, 64 non-commissioned officers and
privates of the N.S. Wales Corps, and 74 convicts. One settler,
James Hill, accompanied the party, and, possibly, another. In
all, there were some 146 persons, all told. The troops were
embarked on Wednesday, 3rd October,&mdash;the music of the band,
says our reporter of the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>, being "only
interrupted by reiterated peals of acclamation from the
spectators." On Sunday, October 14th, the Lieut.-Governor
embarked from the Government wharf, under a salute of 11 guns
from the battery, the band of the N.S. Wales Corps playing "God
Save the King" and "Rule Britannia". Governor King and a number
of ladies and officers accompanied him on board the
<i>Buffalo</i>, which saluted with 11 guns. The little squadron
got clear of the Heads the next forenoon. The ships had a very
rough voyage down, and a succession of heavy gales separated
them. Most of the live stock died; and it was not until the
28th&mdash;a fortnight after leaving Port Jackson&mdash;that the
<i>Buffalo</i> reached Eastern Cove, Kent's Group, where she
found the <i>Francis</i>. Here she lay at anchor for six days,
while it blew a strong gale from the westward. On the 3rd
November, the ships left their anchorage, and next morning the
<i>Buffalo</i> made the entrance of Port Dalrymple. None of her
consorts were in sight to try the channel for the larger vessel;
and Captain Kent, with many misgivings, determined to make the
venture; for he says, in his report to Governor King, "I saw
little probability of the settlement ever being formed unless
some risk was run. I therefore bore up, in dark, cloudy weather,
blowing strong at north-west right on shore, for a harbour
little&mdash;very little&mdash;known, hoping, should any accident
happen to the ship, I might meet with every consideration for my
zeal." After what he had heard of the strength of the tides, he
was surprised to find it running only 1&frac14; miles per hour,
and avers "that a common four-oared jolly-boat, rowed ill, could
always, even in the height of the springs, head the tide between
Green Island and Outer Cove, as it never exceeded three miles an
hour." The night coming on, the ship came to an anchor below
Green Island. It blew very hard in the night, and harder in the
morning, the anchor came home, and the ship drove on shore on the
eastern shoals. Here she lay beating for three days; but the
Integrity, Acting Lieut. Robbins, coming in, they lightened the
ship of part of her cargo; and on the 4th day, after great
exertions, she was got off, fortunately, without damage, and came
to an anchor in Outer Cove (George Town). Here the military,
prisoners, and stores were, landed, the tents were pitched, and
on the 11th November possession was formally taken by hoisting
H.M. Colours under a royal salute from the <i>Buffalo</i> and
three volleys from the troops.</p>
<p>The other two ships did not arrive till the 21st, the <i>Lady
Nelson</i> having suffered much damage from the storm, having had
her decks swept, and having lost all her live stock. Before
leaving, Captain Kent erected a flagstaff at Low Head, and other
beacons, for the guidance of vessels entering the port.</p>
<p>The day after taking possession (12th November), the camp was
approached by a body of some 80 natives, under the lead of a
chief. Presents were offered to the chief&mdash;a looking-glass,
two handkerchiefs, and a tomahawk. Paterson says that the
looking-glass puzzled them much, and that, like monkeys, on
looking at it, they put their hands behind it, to feel if there
was any one there. When they came to the boat, they wanted to
carry off everything they saw, but when made to understand that
this could not be allowed, they retired peaceably. Shortly
afterwards, however, the blacks returned in greater force, and
made an attack on an outpost. A correspondent of the <i>Sydney
Gazette</i> thus describes the incident:&mdash;"An interview took
place with the natives, which began very amicably, but,
unfortunately, their natural impetuosity has caused a temporary
suspension of civilities, they having attempted to throw a
sergeant from a rock into the sea and attacked his guard of two
men, which compelled them to fire in their own defence." One
black was killed, and another wounded, in this affray.</p>
<p>The hurried landing at Outer Cove was necessitated by the
accident to the <i>Buffalo</i>, and the pressing need of
immediately unloading her. As there was a sufficient stream of
water for present use, and about 100 acres of land that might do
for cultivation, Paterson thought it best to keep his people at
the spot where they had landed until he should have had time to
explore the river. Captain Kemp, Dr. Mountgarrett, and Mr.
Reilly, the storekeeper, were appointed the first magistrates of
the settlement, Dr. Mountgarrett acting as Superintendent of
Public Works. Mr. Thos. Massey was made chief constable, with
three subordinates; two overseers were appointed, and Jas. Hill,
the solitary settler, was put in charge of the live stock. His
duties were not onerous, for only a horse, four head of cattle,
three sheep, and 15 swine had survived the storms of the passage.
There was no chaplain, and, as Paterson was at a loss for a
person to perform Divine service, he induced Captain Kent to
discharge from the <i>Buffalo</i> a Mr. Edward Main, who, we may
presume, had some qualifications for the office, and who was
thereupon installed to attend to the spiritual wants of the
little community. The prisoners were set to work to erect
temporary huts for themselves, which were placed clear of the
camp on the opposite side of the creek, to prevent, as far as
possible, communication with the troops, The prisoners worked
hard and cheerfully from daylight to dark every day, and in a
fortnight from the time of landing the huts were completed.</p>
<p>The Governor's next care was to begin cultivation, for, with a
salt meat diet, a plentiful supply of vegetables was most
important to the health of his people. A gang of men was,
therefore, set to work to break up ground. The means at hand for
cultivation were limited; hardly any agricultural implements had
been provided. The seeds had nearly all been destroyed by rats on
the passage down, and most of the plants sent had died, though a
few fruit trees and strawberry and hop plants had been saved. The
Governor had to buy potatoes for seed from the master of the
Integrity, as the authorities had not thought it worth while to
send any for the use of the colony. Paterson's despatches show
that, in fitting out the expedition, there had been the same
extraordinary want of care and foresight in providing necessary
things which seems to have been characteristic of official
preparations for all these early settlements. He complains to
Governor King that the prisoners were wholly destitute of shoes,
and that he had been compelled to ask the purser of the
<i>Buffalo</i> to let him have 100 pairs from the vessel's stock;
while, in such a vital matter as the supply of provisions, the
quantity sent was so inadequate, in view of the difficulty and
uncertainty of obtaining timely aid from headquarters, that he
had thought it necessary to supplement his stock with salt meat
from the <i>Buffalo</i>'s stores.</p>
<p>The Lieut.-Governor had already made some short excursions
from Outer Cove, and Captain Kent, of the <i>Buffalo</i>, had
examined Western Arm, where he had found good streams of water,
land fit for cultivation, and good timber; and, from his report,
Paterson thought that it appeared to be the most eligible
situation for the seat of government. It had taken him three
weeks to get his people fairly settled at Outer Cove, and he was
now free to go up the river, and thoroughly examine the country.
On the 28th November, therefore, he went on board the <i>Lady
Nelson</i>. He took with him Surgeon Mountgarrett; with Ensign
Piper, and a corporal and 3 privates of the N.S. Wales Corps, as
a guard. They ascended the river, making observations of the
country and soil as they went, till they arrived at the junction
of the two rivers forming the present port of Launceston; and
here the vessel came to anchor. Paterson was greatly pleased with
the park-like country on the present site of Launceston, and
considered it better pasture land than the Seven Hills, near
Parramatta. The party now proceeded up the main river (now North
Esk) in the ship's boat and the Governor's wherry. The journal
notes the rich plains on the river banks; and, further on (near
St. Leonard's), the beautiful rising ground to the left, the
green hills covered to the top with trees, and on the other side
of the river&mdash;which was about 20 yards wide&mdash;the plain
with stately gums, great wattles 60 to 80 feet high, and dense
scrub. They pushed on with difficulty, the river being blocked
with drift-wood and fallen trees, and various rapids giving them
much trouble, until they reached a point&mdash;apparently about
the White Hills&mdash;above which they found it impossible to
take the boat. Here they pitched their tent on a rising ground,
and looked with delight over the rich plains, or, rather,
meadows, covered with luxuriant herbs and pasture, and waiting
for the plough. Paterson says, "From my tent there is an extent
which is seen in one view of nearly three miles in length, and,
at places, one in breadth, along the banks of the river, where
thousands of acres may be ploughed without falling a tree. These
plains extend upwards of ten miles along the winding banks, and
everywhere equally fertile." He found good clay for bricks,
abundant timber for building, reeds for thatching, with
everything necessary for agricultural settlement, and considered
the country superior to any yet discovered. They made excursions
on foot some miles further up the liver; and then, "having
ascertained to a certainty that the country in general can hardly
be equaled either for agricultural or pasture land", they made
their way back down the river, and reached the <i>Lady Nelson</i>
near the Cataract, after an absence of four days. Paterson
describes the Cataract Gorge, with its stupendous columns of
basalt rising one above another to over 500 feet in height, as
picturesque beyond description&mdash;the effect being heightened
by the number of black swans, unable to fly, in the smooth water
close to the fall. Paterson named the Cataract River the South
Esk; and, to the main river, including what is now known as the
North Esk, he gave the name of the Tamar, out of compliment to
Governor King, whose birthplace was on the English stream of that
name. After an absence of a fortnight, the <i>Lady Nelson</i> got
back to Western Arm, and entered that shallow inlet. Here
Paterson landed to examine, for the second time, a piece of land
at the head of the Arm, between two streams a quarter of a mile
apart, and which he had named Kent's Burn and M'Millan's Burn. He
says, "On landing, the soil is very forbidding, being a hard
whitish clay mixed with quartz; but towards the hills there are
patches of excellent ground, and the finest timber I ever saw
(gum and wattle). Boats, at high water, can come up close to
either of the runs. After much labour and attention I have paid
in examining every part of the river, I have seen none so
advantageously situated for a permanent settlement as this, where
there is an easy communication with vessels arriving in this
port, as well as with settlements higher up the river. These
favourable circumstances have induced me to determine upon
removing the principal part of my small military force, with most
of the prisoners, and commence clearing ground and erecting the
necessary buildings before the winter sets in."</p>
<p>The question naturally arises, by what extraordinary
perversity of reasoning did Paterson arrive at the conclusion
that the miserable patch of land at the head of Western Arm was
pre-eminently the best place for his chief settlement? He had
just come back from a visit to the splendid site of Launceston,
and the fertile banks of the North Esk, which he described as
superior to any country yet discovered, either in Van Diemen's
Land or New South Wales, and as possessing every possible
advantage for a settlement, including approach to it by a fine
river, navigable for large ships. What induced him, then, after
anxious thought, to pass this by, and deliberately make choice of
a narrow strip of land which he describes as having a forbidding
soil, and which was situated at the head of a shallow and muddy
inlet not accessible even to boats except at high water? The
explanation, I think, is to be found in the policy of the Home
Government. Founding a colony, according to modern ideas, means
to open up the country as speedily as possible, to settle the
lands with energetic cultivators, who will develop the natural
resources of the soil, to attract a population who will thrive
themselves, and advance the colony by the extension of an export
trade. Nothing was further from the thoughts of the Home
authorities than any plan for colonising in this sense. New
Holland was to be, not a colony, but a place for the reception of
criminals&mdash;a settlement to relieve the Home country of the
ever-growing and overwhelming difficulty of disposing of her
criminal population. The British Government not only did not
encourage colonisation, they endeavoured as far as possible to
prevent it, or, at least, to confine it within the narrowest
limits, permitting it only in so far as it might be made to serve
as an auxiliary to their sole object&mdash;the maintenance of a
penal settlement at the smallest possible cost. The subordinate
establishments at Port Phillip, the Derwent, Port Dalrymple,
Newcastle, and other places, were planted, in the first instance,
as military posts, to prevent France establishing herself in
spots where she might be able to harrass the great penal
establishment at Port Jackson. The expeditions of Bowen, of
Collins, and Paterson were mainly precautionary measures, part of
the military policy of England in her great struggle with France.
Prisoners were a useful part of these early establishments, as
providing labour which, by the erecting of buildings and
cultivation of the soil, might make these posts as little
burdensome as possible to the national exchequer. These outlying
settlements, also, if favourably situated, might, in course of
time, become valuable penal stations. Some of them, such as the
Derwent and Port Dalrymple, would further serve the useful
purpose of ports of refuge for the East India Company's vessels
in the China trade, and form convenient posts for the protection
of the whale and seal fisheries from American and other foreign
intruders.</p>
<p>Bowen's choice of Risdon, and Collins' abandonment of Port
Phillip, when he could not find a suitable locality near the
Heads, were not, as is too often supposed, the result of
incapacity and blindness. They wanted to form a station, not to
plant a colony&mdash;a station readily accessible from the
sea&mdash;and the resources of the interior of the country were
of little concern to them, so long as they could find in their
immediate neighbourhood sufficient pasture for their cattle, and
enough agricultural land to yield a food supply for their people.
It was, doubtless, considerations such as these which led
Paterson deliberately to turn away from the fertile banks of the
North Esk, and fix his people on the little strip of forbidding
soil at the head of Western Arm.</p>
<p>The Lieut.-Governor gave the name of York Town to the spot he
had chosen for his town. He marked out the ground for erecting
dwellings, and set the prisoners to work to load the <i>Lady
Nelson</i> and <i>Francis</i> with a portion of the stores and
with two wooden houses which he had brought with him from Port
Jackson. He detained the <i>Lady Nelson</i> until after the new
year, in order to assist in the removal from Outer Cove, and when
she sailed for Port Jackson, on the 11th January, 1805, she took
some tons of the iron ore which he had found in great abundance
in the neighbourhood of his settlement.</p>
<p>From this point it is difficult to trace the history of York
Town from the official papers. Paterson's despatches present a
great contrast to the careful and voluminous reports sent by
Governor Collins from the Derwent. Collins could give interest
even to an official document, and introduced into his despatches
an amount of graphic detail which not only gives us a full
history of events, but enables us to reconstruct the actual
condition of his colony. Paterson was neither so precise nor so
picturesque as Collins; his official communications are meagre,
and his carelessness in supplying regular and full returns
brought upon him the censure of Governor Bligh. The
Lieut.-Governors deficiencies can, however, be partly supplied
from the columns of the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>, which, during the
year 1805, contained many letters giving information with regard
to the new settlement at Port Dalrymple.</p>
<p>In January, or early in February, 1805, the schooner
<i>Integrity</i> was despatched by Governor King to examine a
port situated to the westward of the mouth of the
Tamar&mdash;presumably, Port Sorell&mdash;which had been
discovered by Surgeon Mountgarrett and Ensign Piper, and by them
named Supply River. On the 22nd she left, carrying a report that
the country between the Supply River and York Town had been found
so good that it was intended to give the first free settlers
locations of land in that district. The buildings at York Town
were rapidly approaching completion. The colony at Outer Cove was
doing well, the gardens had flourished, and on the 18th January
(ten weeks after the first landing) the Governor and others who
had cultivated small plots of ground had peas, French beans,
potatoes, and turnips. Vegetables were plentiful, and it was
fully expected that the cultivation of grain would be an equal
success. Towards the end of March, H.M.S. <i>Buffalo</i> again
sailed for the Tamar, carrying an additional military force, 50
prisoners&mdash;mostly from Norfolk Island&mdash;2 horses, 8 head
of cattle, 135 sheep, and a quantity of stores. This made the
total strength about 200 persons. Mrs. Paterson was a passenger
by the <i>Buffalo</i>, and the transference of headquarters to
York Town was completed before the end of March.</p>
<p>By this time Paterson had received a welcome addition to his
resources. Lord Hobart had, in 1803, directed Governor King to
enter into an arrangement with Campbell and Co., of Sydney, to
import cattle from India for the use of Collins' Port Phillip
settlement. When Collins removed to the Derwent, King arranged
with Campbell and Co. to supply these cattle to one or other of
the Van Diemen's Land settlements. The directions as to their
final destination were given in a way sufficiently curious, and
which illustrates the primitive methods in use in those early
days. The master of the vessel bringing the stock, on his arrival
at the entrance of Bass Strait, was to send a boat ashore at Sea
Elephant Bay, King's Island, where he would find a shed, from the
rafters of which a bottle would be suspended, and in the bottle
he would find a letter with the Governor's directions as to the
port at which the cattle were to be landed. The contract price
was to be &pound;25 per head for the cows landed, and &pound;5
per head for the calves. Nine hundred and ten cows were put on
board the ship Sydney at <i>Calcutta</i>. Of these, 298 died on
the passage; the remaining 612, with 10 calves, being safely
landed at Port Dalrymple at the end of March. The cost to the
Imperial Government of this shipment was &pound;15,350.</p>
<p>As York Town did not afford sufficient pasture for the stock,
the Lieutenant-Governor had them landed at Outer Cove, where
Ensign Piper was placed in charge of them. The change of climate
and food, however, was so injurious to them that their numbers
rapidly diminished, and they were removed to the less exposed
western shore, where sheds were erected for their shelter. In
spite of all care and the labour of a large number of men in
providing them with fodder, the winter reduced them so much that
the return of spring saw only 251 of the Bengal cows surviving.
Paterson, therefore, had them removed, first to Point Rapid, and
then to the plains on the North Esk, where they found better
pasture and a more congenial climate. Although York Town was now
the headquarters, Paterson still kept up an establishment at
Outer Cove, as his port and his depot for stock. He also had a
small post at the Low Head flagstaff and at Green Island, which
formed his store depot. This did not meet with the approval of
the Governor at Sydney, who objected to the division of his
forces, and thought they ought to be concentrated at his
principal settlement.</p>
<p>There is little more to tell respecting the York Town
Settlement. After a few months' trial, Paterson found the site so
unsuitable that, in March, 1806, he moved his headquarters to the
banks of the North Esk&mdash;the present site of Launceston. A
small establishment was, however, maintained in the old port for
upwards of a year longer, and then York Town was finally
abandoned.</p>
<p>For long years afterwards the whole district was deserted,
save for a few scattered and insignificant holdings. Towards the
year 1870 (I think) attention was directed to the working of the
rich iron deposits in the neighbourhood of Western Arm, and large
smelting works were erected at Ilfracombe. The enterprise proved
a failure.</p>
<p>Though the iron industry had failed, gold was destined to
restore the fortunes of the district. Gold was discovered, in
1870, at Cabbage-tree Hill, in the vicinity of Middle Arm, and,
by the development of the Tasmania Mine, a considerable
population has been attracted, so that in the present year we
have the town of Beaconsfield a prosperous mining centre,
claiming to be the third town in the Colony, within less than
five miles of the spot which Lieutenant-Governor Paterson
designed to make the capital of northern Tasmania.</p>
<p>Anyone who has the curiosity to see the ruins of this early
settlement may easily reach the spot from Beaconsfield. A rough
bush-track, practicable for a chaise-cart, winds in a
north-westerly direction through miserably-poor country, covered
with gum forest and a heath-like scrub, intermingled with the
dwarf grass-tree. After travelling for about 5 miles along this
track, and crossing the Anderson's Creek of Paterson, we reach
McMillan's Burn, now known as Massey's Creek, and emerge from the
bush. Between this creek and a creek on the north, called by
Paterson Kent's Burn, but now known as the York Town Rivulet,
just at the head of the Western Arm, is a cleared flat of
indifferent land, 300 to 400 yards wide. This is the site of
Paterson's settlement. On the banks of the northern creek are
some fair grass paddocks; and, immediately beyond, rises an
abrupt, almost precipitous, wooded ridge, to which Paterson gave
the name of Mount Albany. From the side of this hill the flat on
which York Town stood lies spread out below us. Two little wooden
cottages, or huts, surrounded by neglected orchards, are the only
habitations. To the left stretch the shallow waters of Western
Arm. fringed with extensive mud-flats, which are bare at low
water. The owner of one of the huts on the desolate clearing is
an old man, the son of a man who came with Paterson's first
establishment. He is ready to tell the visitor of blacks and
bushrangers, and of the days when there was a Government House,
and York Town was busy with soldiers and prisoners.</p>
<p>Ruins of the original Settlement there are none. The old
inhabitant points to a hole, from which the foundations have been
long ago removed, as the site of Government House, and to a clump
of wattles as the spot where once stood Captain Kemp's house, the
birthplace of the late Mr. George A. Kemp. This is
all;&mdash;except there, back in the bush, where the little
valley widens, are a few mounds under the gum-trees, half hidden
by the low scrub, and indicating neglected and forgotten
graves.</p>

<h3>THE DEPORTATION OF THE NORFOLK ISLANDERS TO THE DERWENT IN
1808.</h3>
<p align="center"><small>BY JAMES BACKHOUSE WALKER.</small></p>
<br>
<a name="ch-25" id="ch-25"></a>
<h4>I. THE SETTLEMENT OF NORFOLK ISLAND.</h4>
<p><small>THE</small> laborious and valuable researches made in
the English State Record Office by the veteran historian, Mr.
James Bonwick, have a great interest for Australians, and mark a
new departure for the historian of the Australian Colonies.</p>
<p>The Government of New South Wales has shown its sense of the
value of the documents which Mr. Bonwick has discovered by
printing them <i>in extenso</i>.* Our own Government, equally
mindful of the importance of these records for the elucidation of
our early history, has, with a wise forethought, availed itself
of Mr. Bonwick's special knowledge to secure copies of the papers
relating to the settlement and earliest history of Tasmania. Of
this period no contemporary records have been preserved in our
local archives; our knowledge of those early times has hitherto
been derived merely from vague and inaccurate tradition. The
material supplied by Mr. Bonwick, and placed at my disposal by
the courtesy of the Government, has enabled me to lay before the
Royal Society the first authentic story of the planting of
Tasmania and of the motives which led to it.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Up to this date (1895) five volumes have
appeared, viz., Historical Records of New South Wales, 1762-1795
(3 vols.): History of New South Wales from the Records, 1783-1789
(2 vols.).]</p>
<p>In former papers which I have had the honour of reading before
the Society, we have seen how the occupation of our Island came
about. It was merely one episode of the long life-and-death
struggle which England waged with France under the first
Napoleon. It was due to the dread of possible injury to England
from the sudden intrusion of a hostile French settlement in such
close proximity to the young English colony at Port Jackson. The
first puny occupation by Bowen at Risdon, in September, 1803; the
expedition of Collins to Port Phillip, and its transfer to
Hobart, in February, 1804; the occupation of the Tamar by
Patterson, in August of the same year, and the consequent
settlement of northern Tasmania, were all parts of the far-seeing
and persistent policy by which the great English statesmen of
that day did much to ensure the fall of Napoleon's power, and to
give to England her world-wide dominion.</p>
<p>The next chapter in our colonial history to which I ask your
attention demands for our comprehension of its significance that
we should leave these high questions of statesmanship, and turn
our view for a time to a small and solitary island, separated
from us by more than a thousand miles of ocean, the fortunes of
which have, nevertheless, been strangely interwoven with those of
our own colony.</p>
<p>Situated in seas where perpetual summer reigns, endowed with
great natural beauty, rich in the fruits of the tropics, few
spots in our modern world have had a history so strange, so
various, so horrible, and yet so romantic, as that of Norfolk
Island. At the present time it is the secure retreat of an easy
and indolent race, who are yet the descendants of the actors in
one of the most noted and picturesque piratical deeds recorded in
English annals. It is, moreover, the peaceful headquarters of a
Christian mission to the savage islands, where the saintly
Paterson laid down his life. It is most familiar to us as a
synonym for cruelty and crime, a reminiscence of the days when
the distant island formed a dependency and a part of the then
penal settlement of Van Diemen's Land. To the majority this,
which is within the memory of many still living amongst us, is
the only known link between our colony and it&mdash;perhaps the
only known fact respecting its earlier history. Comparatively few
are aware that&mdash;with the single exception of
Sydney&mdash;Norfolk Island is the oldest English colony in the
South Seas. Perhaps still fewer know that to that same far-off
island so familiar to us in later days under another aspect,
Tasmania was indebted for a large proportion of her earliest
colonists. To this historical fact the familiar names of New
Norfolk in the south, and Norfolk Plains in the north, of this
colony remain a perpetual but unappreciated memorial.</p>
<p>The history of Norfolk Island and its early colonists thus
becomes an essential part of the history of Tasmania. The history
of its colonisation and settlement can be gathered from scattered
references in the works of Collins and other contemporary
writers, but Mr. Bonwick's researches in the Record Office enable
me to lay before the Royal Society the first authentic story of
the evacuation of the island and the transference of all its free
settlers to the Derwent in 1808.</p>
<p>And, first, as to its discovery. The first voyage of Captain
Cook, lasting from 1768 to 1771, was that in which he did his
most memorable work. The immediate object of the expedition was
the observation of the Transit of Venus at Tahiti, in the South
Seas. But the voyage had more important results than astronomical
observations, valuable as these were to science. In his little
north-country collier of 370 tons, the <i>Endeavour</i>, Cook
re-discovered and examined the islands of New Zealand, and then,
steering for the as yet unknown coast of New Holland, anchored in
Botany Bay (28th April, 1770), and examined the whole eastern
coast, to which he gave the name of New South Wales. In two short
years of this memorable voyage, our great navigator had,
practically, added the possessions of Australia and New Zealand
to the English Crown, a work, possibly, only second in its
importance in the world's history to the discovery of
America.</p>
<p>Though Cook's first voyage was, beyond question, the most
fruitful in results, yet the more leisurely explorations of his
second voyage, in the <i>Resolution</i> and the <i>Adventure</i>,
extending from 1772 to 1775, are fuller of interest to the
reader. Cook himself states the object of this second expedition
to have been "to complete the discovery of the Southern
Hemisphere." His first voyage had proved that if, as the
geographers believed, any great southern continent did exist, it
must lie far to the south of the latitude of New Holland. In
three successive years during this second voyage, Cook sailed to
the far south, making three unsuccessful attempts to penetrate
the frozen sea, and finally demonstrating that the dream of
centuries had no foundation, and that there was no <i>Terra
Australis Incognita</i> outside the limits of the circumpolar
ice. In the intervals between his attempts on the Antarctic
Ocean, Cook employed the winter months in making further
explorations in the Pacific, and his journals contain most
fascinating descriptions of this first view of the islands of the
south, and of their inhabitants in their original wild condition.
In 1774, he employed his time in cruising among the Pacific
Islands, beginning at Easter Island, with its gigantic stone
figures, mysterious relics of a forgotten civilisation. Thence,
after a stay at his beloved Tahiti, he worked westward among the
islands to New Caledonia, on his way to make his third and final
attempt on the Antarctic Circle.</p>
<p>On the 10th October, 1774, as the <i>Resolution</i> was slowly
ploughing her way from New Caledonia towards New Zealand, land
was discovered bearing S.W. It was found to be an island of good
height, five leagues in circumference. The island was bounded by
rocky cliffs on nearly every side, with 18 to 20 fathoms water
close to the shore. Cook says, "I named it Norfolk Isle, in
honour of the noble family of Howard."</p>
<p>The boats were launched, and, the weather being exceptionally
favourable, the captain landed without difficulty behind some
large rocks on the north-east side, near what was afterwards
known as the Cascades. Along the shore was a belt of thick scrub,
and beyond this a dense forest of a sort of spruce pine, the
trees as thick as two men could fathom, and exceedingly straight
and tall. The soil was rich and deep, and the Captain found many
trees and plants common to New Zealand, particularly the
flax-plant, growing near the sea most luxuriantly, and much finer
than he had seen it in New Zealand. The woods abounded with
pigeons, parrots, parrakeets, hawks, and many New Zealand birds.
The island was uninhabited. The party from the <i>Resolution</i>
may have been the first human beings to tread its tangled
forests, though it is possible that, at isolated periods
previously, Maori canoes had been driven by heavy south-east
storms from the coast of New Zealand, and that shipwrecked Maoris
had maintained an existence on the island for years; for, in the
early days of the settlement, two canoes were found on the
beaches, and, it is said, stone adzes resembling those in use in
New Zealand, were turned up when the land was being broken up for
cultivation. Cook gave but a few hours to the examination of the
island, and, on the following day sailed away for New Zealand. On
the publication of his book, his description, brief as it was, of
the capabilities of Norfolk Island, of its rich soil, its dense
pine forests, and profuse growth of New Zealand flax, attracted
attention to it as a desirable possession. Consequently, when the
Government, in the year 1787, resolved on establishing a penal
settlement at Botany Bay, it was determined to occupy this
promising island as a dependency of the principal colony. In the
Royal instructions to Governor Phillip, the following passage
occurs:&mdash;"Norfolk Island . . . . being represented as a spot
which may hereafter become useful, you are, as soon as
circumstances admit of it, to send a small establishment thither
to secure the same to us, and prevent it being occupied by the
subjects of any other European power." The instructions also
contain directions to the Governor as to the cultivation of the
flax-plant, and its use in manufacturing clothing for the
convicts and also for maritime purposes.</p>
<p>Little more than a week after Governor Phillip had landed on
the site of Sydney (6th February, 1788), Philip Gidley King, then
a young lieutenant on board H.M.S. <i>Sirius</i>, received his
commission as Superintendent and Commandant of the settlement of
Norfolk Island, with orders to take a small party of people and
some live-stock to this distant isle, which was intended to serve
as a place of seclusion for troublesome characters, and as a
possible succour for the main settlement in case of famine. The
party placed under King's charge was very similar to that which,
15 years later, he himself despatched under Lieut. Bowen to
occupy Risdon, on the Derwent. It consisted of an officer and
surgeon from H.M.S. <i>Sirius</i>, four seamen, and two marines
from the same vessel, with nine male and six female convicts.
They sailed from Port Jackson in the armed tender <i>Supply</i>,
and were 14 days before, on 29th February, they came in sight of
their destination. For days they cruised round the island,
searching in vain for a harbour, or even a landing-place,
sometimes in the ship, sometimes exploring the shores in a boat,
but everywhere baffled by the inaccessible cliffs or the
thundering surf of the ocean swell on the rocky beaches. At last,
after live days' search, and when they had almost despaired of
success, they found a beach in a bay on the south side of the
island, protected by a long reef, extending parallel with the
shore, and about 150 yards distant from it. At the end of the
reef was an opening, little more than sufficient to allow two
boats to pass each other, which gave access to the smooth water
inside. Here King got his little party landed, with their stores,
and soon had a small patch of ground cleared and tents pitched.
Having settled his colony, King now proceeded to explore his new
domain. He describes the island as six miles long and four broad,
and estimated it to contain about 11,000 acres. The ground was
everywhere covered with an almost impervious forest, through
which he forced his way with great difficulty. The principal tree
Was the pine, which grew everywhere. These great trees were often
140 to 200 feet high, 30 feet round at the base, and 80 feet to
the first branch. The roots sometimes ran two feet above the
ground, twisted in all directions. In this forest grew a sort of
supplejack as thick as a man's leg, hanging in festoons from tree
to tree, and forming a network which was well nigh impenetrable.
From the highest point of the island, 1200 feet above the
sea-level, which he named Mount Pitt, he had a view of a
continuous forest without a break, for, in its natural state,
there was not a yard square of clear ground on the whole island.
The soil was deep and rich, but not a blade of grass grew
anywhere. Pigeons and parrots were in great numbers; the pigeons
so tame that they could be knocked over with a stick. These
explorations were made with great difficulty, and the explorers
often returned with their clothes torn to shreds. To conquer the
virgin forest King had only 12 men, and one of these was an old
man of 72, another a boy of 15. Small as the company was, it was
a difficult one to manage. Before a month passed, the boy, having
been caught stealing rum, was punished with 100 lashes, which
King, in his diary, remarks, he hoped would have a good effect;
and, later on, we hear of a woman being punished in a similar
way. To add to the Commandant's troubles, all his people were ill
with scurvy, from their salt diet, and his first attention was
given to obtaining fresh provisions. At first they got turtle,
but these were soon scared away. The fish supply was precarious,
as fishing was only possible in calm weather. Their chief
resource was the pigeons, and the birds which abounded on Mount
Pitt gave them many a good meal. A few banana trees were found
growing not far from the settlement, but for vegetables they were
chiefly dependent on nikau-palm, the crown of which furnished a
good vegetable, not unlike a cabbage.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the progress of the settlement was
very slow, but gradually, as the little colony was reinforced by
fresh drafts from Sydney, ground was cleared and brought under
cultivation, huts and store-houses were erected, and a
weatherboard cottage, 24 feet by 12 feet, was built for a
Government house. In January, 1790, two years after his first
landing, there were on the island 79 male and 33 female convicts
and 32 free settlers; in all, 144 souls. King's administration of
Norfolk Island lasted (with one interval) from February, 1788, to
September, 1796, a period of eight and a half years. He has left
a diary of those days, extending over many quarto pages of print.
It is dreary reading, being a chronicle of petty crimes and rough
punishments, of crops destroyed by blight or grub, of disorders,
conspiracies, and mutinies among the prisoners, of discontent
among the settlers, whether free or emancipated. King ruled this
turbulent community like a sailor, with a mixture of rough
severity and good-natured lenity, dealing out barbaric punishment
to offenders, and equally barbaric indulgences as a reward for
improved behaviour.</p>
<p>The early attempts at agriculture were not very successful.
When his first little patch of wheat came up, the south-west wind
blighted it, and turned it black; the next crop (and many a one
after that) was nipped off by a small black caterpillar, which
came in thousands; others were destroyed by a great worm; much
was eaten by parrakeets; and, even when the wheat was harvested,
it was attacked by the weevil and rendered useless. The
rats&mdash;the only animals on the island&mdash;ate his Indian
corn, in spite of traps and pounded glass mixed with oatmeal,
which slew them in hundreds. The most successful crops were
potatoes and vegetables. Nor was he more successful with his live
stock than with his agriculture. There being no grass on the
island, the stock had to be fed with herbs and plants. The sheep
succumbed and died, partly from starvation, partly from scab. The
pigs suffered greatly from poisonous herbs, and he had great
difficulty in feeding them until he discovered that a tall palm,
or fern, growing 80 feet high, had a soft core tasting like a bad
turnip, on which the hogs throve splendidly.</p>
<p>In spite of all these misfortunes, however, and in spite of
the calamity of a hurricane of wind and rain from the south-east,
which laid waste and nearly destroyed the camp and the
plantations, the little settlement struggled ahead.</p>
<p>In January, 1790, the Commandant records with pride that he
had 30 acres of land in cultivation, and his free settlers 18
acres. He had in store 300 bushels of wheat and 140 bushels of
Indian corn.</p>
<p>While King was thus rejoicing in the progress of his little
colony, he little thought of the troubles which were impending,
and which were destined to make the year 1790 a sad and memorable
year for the Norfolk Islanders.</p>
<p>To understand the position of affairs, we must turn for a
moment to the principal settlement at Port Jackson. The two
years' supply of provisions which the First Fleet had brought out
was now nearly exhausted, and every one at Port Jackson was in
daily and anxious expectation of the arrival of ships from
England with a fresh supply. In February only four months'
provisions, calculated at half-allowance, remained in store. It
was impossible to say when relief might arrive, and the prospect
of starvation began to stare them in the face.</p>
<p>In this emergency, Governor Phillip resolved to divide the
settlement, and send a large body of convicts and soldiers to
Norfolk Island. The Commandant had constantly written in such
high terms of the rich soil of the island that it seemed a garden
of fertility in comparison with. New South Wales, and the
Governor thought it would easily support a larger population, and
thus relieve the distress of those left in the principal colony.
Accordingly, Captain Hunter was ordered to prepare H.M.S.
<i>Sirius</i> for sea, and embark 186 convicts and a company of
marines, while the armed tender <i>Supply</i> was to accompany
her with 20 convicts and another company of marines. This would
make an almost equal division of the people between the island
and the main settlement at Port Jackson: Major Ross, the
Lieut.-Governor, was to be placed in command of the dependency,
in place of Lieut. King, who had obtained leave to visit England.
A proper proportion of the remaining provisions and stores were
put on board, and the ships sailed for Norfolk Island on the 6th
March, 1790. A week's sail brought them to the island, and not
being able to land in Sydney Bay on account of the surf, they ran
round to Cascade Bay, on the north side, and in two days
contrived to land the people, 270 in all. Before they could land
the stores, a storm came on, and the ships were driven out of
sight of land. It was four days before the <i>Sirius</i> could
make the island again. The <i>Supply</i> was already in Sydney
Bay, and the signal was flying that the landing was safe. Captain
Hunter, therefore, stood in, loaded the boats with provisions,
and sent them in to the landing-place within the reef. Meanwhile,
as the <i>Sirius</i> was settling fast to leeward, Hunter made
sail to get her out of the bay, but could not weather the rocks
off Point Ross, on the western side. The ship twice missed stays,
and then slowly drifted stern first towards the reef opposite the
settlement, and struck. The masts were instantly cut away, so
that she might lift on to the reef, as she was in danger of going
to pieces from the force of the seas that struck her. This was 11
<small>A.M</small>. All the provisions that could be reached were
immediately got on deck and secured. This accomplished, a line
was floated over the reef with an empty cask, and a hawser hauled
on shore and made fast to a tree. At 5 o'clock the surgeon's mate
was hauled ashore through the surf on a traveller fastened to the
hawser, and by dark Captain Hunter and most of the seamen were
landed, having been dragged through a heavy surf, many being much
bruised. The captain was so exhausted that he was nearly drowned.
The rest of the crew got ashore next day.</p>
<p>The situation of the settlement was extremely critical. There
were now on the island 506 souls, on half-allowance of
provisions, which would last a very short time, unless the stores
could be saved from the <i>Sirius</i>. Lieut.-Governor Ross
therefore assembled the officers, and it was resolved that, as,
under the ordinary law, there was no power to punish serious
offences on the spot, it was absolutely necessary, for the
general safety, to establish martial law. Further, that all
provisions, public and private, should be thrown into a common
stock in the storehouse, and put under the charge of three
persons, viz., Captain Hunter, a person appointed by the
Governor, and a third person, to be named by the convicts. On the
fifth day after the wreck, and before any of the provisions had
been saved from the <i>Sirius</i>, the <i>Supply</i> sailed for
Sydney, with Lieut. King and part of the crew of the
<i>Sirius</i>, to carry the disastrous news to Port Jackson,
where it created fresh consternation, and deepened the prevailing
gloom; the more so from the impossibility of sending relief to
the unfortunate Norfolk Islanders.</p>
<p>Fortunately, after the <i>Supply</i> left, they were able to
get out of the wreck a large part of the provisions, though much
was lost or spoiled. For some weeks, Lieut.-Governor Ross,
Captain Hunter, and the people shut up in the lonely isle
entertained a glimmering hope that they might see the
<i>Supply</i> return with the comfortable news of arrivals from
England. Long and anxiously they scanned the sea, and, when hope
failed, and they had come to the reluctant conclusion that
Governor Phillip could not relieve them, but had been obliged to
send Lieut. Ball on more pressing service, their situation began
to wear a very alarming aspect.</p>
<p>The weekly allowance of food was now still, further reduced,
and Captain Hunter records in his journal his apprehension that,
before long, many of the convicts, who often ate at one meal the
whole week's allowance, would be dead from starvation, or
executed for depredations. This gloomy anticipation would,
doubtless, have been realised but for an unexpected resource
which was discovered.</p>
<p>In the month of April, the people, who were searching the
island for food, found that Mount Pitt was crowded with birds.
These sea-birds were away all day in search of food, but as soon
as dark came on they hovered in vast flocks over the
breeding-ground, which was hollowed by innumerable burrows. The
seamen, marines, and convicts went out to Mount Pitt every
evening, arriving soon after dark. They lighted small fires to
attract the birds, which alighted faster than the people could
knock them down. After killing 2000 to 3000 birds every night,
there was no sensible diminution in their numbers at the end of
May. The people called the birds "Pittites"; Phillip, in his
voyage, gives it the name of the Norfolk Island Petrel. It is
known to us in Tasmania as the Mutton Bird.</p>
<p>Captain Hunter, in his journal, calls it the <i>Bird of
Providence</i>. Such it undoubtedly was to the Norfolk Islanders,
who, but for its timely and wholly unexpected arrival, must have
perished in numbers from starvation. It is true that the sea
abounded in fish, and the neighbouring islets (Phillip Island and
Nepean Island) swarmed with countless multitudes of sea fowl, but
they were unattainable. For a month together the surf ran so high
that not more than once or twice during that time was it possible
to launch a boat, and even then the fishing was often
unsuccessful, while the islands that the sea-birds frequented
were usually inaccessible on account of the tremendous surf.</p>
<p>Towards the end of July, the birds on Mount Pitt began to get
scarce. As only 10 or 12 days' salt provisions, at short
allowance, were now left, the Lieut.-Governor reduced the ration
to three lbs. flour, or maize meal, and one pint of rice per
week. The people were so reduced by want of food that hardly any
work could be done, and it was with great difficulty that the
little crops could be got in.</p>
<p>On the 4th August, while in this deplorable state, with famine
staring them in the face, one of the sailors came running into
the settlement, crying out&mdash;"A ship! a ship!" Men, women,
and children rushed out to welcome her, and Captain Hunter and
many of the people hurried across to the north of the island to
communicate with her; but when they arrived in sight of her, in
spite of their signals, she stood off before the wind, and sailed
away. Hunter, in his journal, published some years later, speaks
of their bitter disappointment and indignation at the want of
humanity in the captain, who, although he might have nothing for
them, might, at least, have informed them of the near approach of
relief.</p>
<p>From the appearance of the ship, the people were convinced
that relief was not far distant, and, three days later, two ships
hove in sight. They proved to be the <i>Justinian</i> and
<i>Surprise</i>, from Port Jackson, with provisions and 200
-convicts. The mystery of the non-arrival of supplies from
England was now cleared up. The <i>Guardian</i>, Captain Riou,
had sailed from Plymouth for Sydney with provisions in August,
1789, but she had been wrecked at the Cape, and it was not until
the arrival at Port Jackson of the Second Fleet, in June, 1790,
that the people felt the danger of starvation to be past.</p>
<p>The relief at last sent to the islanders had, with
unaccountable want of consideration, been delayed two months
after the arrival of the fleet, and it arrived only just in time.
The mutton birds, had deserted the island, the fish also had
failed them entirely, and a delay of another six weeks would have
meant death by starvation for the greater part of the
inhabitants.</p>
<p>Captain Hunter did not get away from the island, which was
associated with so much suffering and anxiety to him, until
February, 1791. He considered its capabilities much over-rated,
for&mdash;while he admits the richness of the soil&mdash;the
crops were liable to destruction by blight, grub, caterpillar,
and other plagues. The timber, of which so much had been
expected, was very inferior. Instead of being able to support
2000 people, as Governor Phillip expected, he thought 500 too
many, and these should be such as had forfeited all hope of
seeing their native country again, and would know that their
existence depended on their industry. He recommended the
Government to remove the establishment to Port Dalrymple, as its
only use could be to supply South Sea whalers with fresh meat and
vegetables; though he admitted that, as a place for incorrigible
criminals, the colony had this advantage&mdash;that escape was
impossible. Of the island, he says, "It is a dreadful place,
almost inaccessible with any wind."</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the unfavourable opinion of Captain Hunter and
others, Governor Phillip continued to send fresh batches of
convicts and small settlers, and when Lieut.-Governor Ross gave
up the command to King, on the return of the latter from England,
in September, 1791, the population had increased to over 800
souls.</p>
<p>King had now the rank of Lieut.-Governor of Norfolk Island. He
had founded the colony, and took the most sanguine view of its
capabilities, and of the practicability of making it prosperous
and self-supporting. Besides getting a large area of land under
cultivation by the labour of the prisoners, he encouraged those
whose time had expired to take up small allotments for growing
vegetables and grain. A number of soldiers and sailors were also
induced, by the offer of grants of land up to 60 acres, to become
agricultural settlers.</p>
<p>The greatest obstacle to the progress of the settlement lay in
the character of the people. Kings says of the prisoners that,
while some were well behaved, the bulk of them were miserable
wretches. Collins, in his account of New South Wales, gives a
deplorable picture of the disorder and crime which were rampant
at Port Jackson, and as the selection for Norfolk Island
consisted of the worst and the doubly-convicted, the condition of
affairs in the island was not likely to be better than in Sydney.
The settlers were mostly soldiers and sailors and others who had
little or no knowledge of agriculture, and were full of
grievances and complaints. Still, the colony increased in
population and production. At the end of 1793, there were 1008
souls on the island. The settlers had become a considerable body,
and they had command of a plentiful supply of labour in the
expiree prisoners, who had hired themselves out to farm-work. The
Government took into store all grain grown by the settlers at a
fixed price per bushel. This so stimulated production that, in
the year ending May, 1794, there were grown 34,000 bushels of
maize and wheat. The settlers were all prosperous, and the
Lieut.-Governor was able to offer to send, if required, 20,000
bushels to Sydney for commissariat use. The supply was now so
large that the Governor was obliged to refuse to purchase grain
which he could make no use of, and the settlers found themselves
without a market. Many gave up their farms; many left the island;
others turned their attention to raising hogs, which had
multiplied exceedingly. In 1795, King could offer the Sydney
commissariat 40 tons of cured pork, which had been salted on the
island.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the New Zealand flax-plant was most
plentiful at Norfolk Island. Lieut.-Governor King was very
anxious to develop the manufacture of the fibre into cordage and
canvas. Many attempts were made, but with small success, as no
proper method of dressing the fibre could be discovered. King's
method of grappling with this difficulty is sufficiently
characteristic of the times. He offered to Captain Bunker, of the
whaler <i>William and Ann</i>, &pound;100 to kidnap two natives
of New Zealand, and bring them to Norfolk Island, as instructors
in the art of flax-dressing. Captain Bunker did not succeed in
earning the money. King seems to have made his views known to the
Admiralty, for, when the <i>D&aelig;dalus</i> storeship was
employed to carry provisions to the Sandwich Islands for
Vancouver's discovery ships, Lieut. Hanson, who commanded her,
was directed to touch at New Zealand on his way back to Sydney,
and try to supply King's wants. The <i>D&aelig;dalus</i>
accordingly touched at New Zealand, about Doubtless Bay, and
Lieut. Hanson having enticed on board his ship two Maoris, named
Tuki and Uru, at once made sail, and carried them away to
Governor King. The Maoris, who had been frantic with grief when
they found themselves entrapped, were very sullen on their
arrival at Norfolk Island, and absolutely refused any information
respecting the flax. King says:&mdash;"The apprehension of being
obliged to work at it was afterwards found, to have been a
principal reason for their not complying so readily as was
expected. By kind treatment, however, and indulgence in their own
inclinations, they soon began to be more sociable. They were then
given to understand the situation and short distance of New
Zealand from Norfolk Island, and were assured that, as soon as
they had taught our women to work the flax, they should be sent
home again. On this promise, they readily consented to give all
the information they possessed, and which turned out to be very
little. This operation was found to be among them the peculiar
province of the women; and as Uru was a warrior and Tuki a
priest, they gave the Governor to understand that the dressing of
flax never made any part of their studies." Whatever may be
thought of the means King employed to obtain the services of Uru
and Tuki, it must be acknowledged that he fulfilled his promises
to them very handsomely. He decided to accompany them to New
Zealand, and embarked with them and a guard of soldiers on board
the Britannia to take them back to their homes. This was safely
accomplished, and the Governor and his Maori friends parted with
great expressions of mutual regard.</p>
<p>The instruction given by Tuki and Uru, meagre as it was, was
sufficient to enable a few hands, with very primitive appliances,
to manufacture 30 yards of coarse canvas in a week, and the
Lieut.-Governor stuck pluckily to his manufactory, maintaining to
the last that it was a valuable industry, and could easily give
employment to 500 hands.</p>
<p>On the 25th October, 1796, Lieut.-Governor King gave up the
government, which he had held, with a short interval, for nearly
nine years, and proceeded by the Britannia to England. Shortly
afterwards, he received the appointment of Governor of New South
Wales, in which capacity, in 1803, he despatched Lieutenant
Bowen to establish the first settlement in Tasmania.</p>
<p>On leaving Norfolk Island, he wrote an account of the
condition of the settlement; which is printed in Collins' "New
South Wales"; the population was 887, and of these only 198 were
convicts. He says that 1528 acres had been cleared. Besides huts
and cottages, a Government-house, storehouses, and military
barracks had been built. A water-mill had been erected at the
Cascades, and this and two wind-mills ground the corn which each
man had formerly to grind for himself. There were two schools on
the island.</p>
<p>Of the fertility of the land he spoke highly; the principal
products were maize, wheat, potatoes, and vegetables. The yield
of wheat averaged 18 bushels per acre. Maize gave two crops a
year, averaging 45 bushels per acre, and often reaching as much
as 70 to 80 bushels. He calculated that, if the whole of the
arable land was put under cultivation, it would produce 225,000
bushels of grain, or even 450,000, if fully cultivated. There was
little live stock, a few cattle and sheep, a number of goats, and
fully 5000 swine. The swine might be a great source of revenue;
up to that time, 500,000 lbs. of pork had been used or
exported.</p>
<p>With King's departure, the settlement began to retrograde; but
the story of its gradual decline, and the final deportation of
its settlers to Tasmania, must be left to be dealt with in a
future paper.</p>
<br>
<a name="ch-26" id="ch-26"></a>
<h4>II. THE DEPORTATION TO THE DERWENT.</h4>
<p>In the last paper which I read before the Society, I sketched
the strange story of the first planting of a European colony in
an island of the South Sea,&mdash;the settlement of Norfolk
Island by Lieut. King, in the year 1788, and its fortunes during
a period of eight years. I now propose to trace the history of
its failure and abandonment, and the transfer of its settlers to
our own island.</p>
<p>From his first landing, in February, 1788, Lieut. King had
formed the most sanguine expectations of the future. He was
charmed with the beauty of the island. With such a genial climate
and such a fertile soil, it should grow into one of the most
flourishing and valuable of colonies. From this view he never
wavered. To secure this result he struggled bravely and
pertinaciously to overcome the difficulties of nature and the
perversity of man. Nature met him on the threshold with a
well-nigh inaccessible coast, and a dense and tangled forest, and
fought him with hurricanes and blighting winds, with drought and
caterpillars, which marred his labour. But to rule and organise
the unpromising human material with which he had to work, and to
turn it to account in the face of laziness and disaffection, was
a more trying task than to conquer nature. Still, during those
eight or nine years, he had fought his way through difficulty,
and not a few disasters, to the attainment of a very fair
success. When, in September, 1796, he resigned his government, he
left, with the feeling that the settlement to which he had given
some of the best years of his life had overcome its first
difficulties, and was firmly established, with a bright outlook
for the future. The little island had a population of nearly 900
people, who dotted its surface with clearings and cottages. More
than a third of its area (5247 acres) was occupied, and 1528
acres cleared and cultivated. The production of grain and pork
not only sufficed for the wants of the inhabitants, but left a
large surplus for exportation to New South Wales. And yet the
resources of the island were, in his view, only beginning to be
developed. Instead of a population of 1000, he considered it
could easily support more than twice that number, and could more
than quadruple its products. By ordinary methods it would be easy
to produce a quarter of a million of bushels of grain; careful
husbandry might even double that quantity. In King's opinion, it
might become a paradise for small land-holders, who would be
enriched by the labour of those convicts whom it was desirable to
isolate from the main settlement. The settlers would consist of
soldiers, sailors, and the better class of expiree prisoners,
while forced labour would clear and cultivate their lands and
build their houses. New South Wales would benefit by the removal
of the worst and the most turbulent, and these would be easily
controlled in an isolated dependency by a small military force,
and, under strict discipline, would be transformed into a means
of wealth to the community, instead of being a menace to its
order. The mistake of the New South Wales settlement had been
that it had been formed exclusively of convicts; but in Norfolk
Island the true solution of the transportation question would be
found. It would be a community of free settlers, to which the
convicts would supply labour. It would be not only a
self-supporting, but a profitable penal colony.</p>
<p>When Captain King left Norfolk Island for England, in the
<i>Britannia</i>, in 1796, he handed over the command to the
principal military officer, Captain Townson, of the New South
Wales Corps. Now that the island produced grain and meat enough
to feed its inhabitants, its most pressing want was a vessel
expressly appropriated to its service, and always ready, for
communication with Sydney. Vessels were so few at Port Jackson
that none could be -spared for the exclusive use of Norfolk
Island. Captain Townson, therefore, determined to try what the
island could do for itself. The indigenous pine provided timber
in plenty, but appliances were few, and the want of a harbour
presented almost insuperable obstacles to ship-building. However,
after some months' labour, there stood upon the beach before the
settlement a little, craft of 25 tons, built of Norfolk Island
pine, completely rigged and equipped for sea. An ingenious man on
the island made a quadrant with which to navigate her. She was
launched from the shore, and had to go on her voyage to Sydney
without any further preparation. Probably, she was strained in
launching, for she proved to be very leaky. With the aid of two
pumps, however, the little crew managed to keep the water under,
and she safely reached Port Jackson (15th June, 1798), with the
Commandant's despatches to Governor Hunter. This vessel, the
first and the only one built at Norfolk Island, was named the
<i>Norfolk</i>, and though little more than a decked longboat,
she was destined to do good service, and attain a certain
celebrity. Captain Townson and the Norfolk Islanders were not
allowed to benefit by the vessel which they had built with so
much difficulty. When she reached Port Jackson, Flinders and Bass
were burning with anxiety to solve once for all the vexed problem
of Bass Strait and the insularity of Van Diemen's Land. They
persuaded Governor Hunter to fit up the Norfolk for a voyage of
discovery, and four months after her arrival at Sydney she sailed
with those two adventurous explorers, passed through Bass Strait,
and accomplished the first circumnavigation of Van Diemen's
Land.</p>
<p>In April, 1800, Captain King returned to New South Wales from
England, but he did not go back to his old government at Norfolk
Island. He had brought with him His Majesty's Commission as
Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales, and when Governor Hunter
left Sydney for England in September, 1800, King succeeded him in
the government of the principal Colony.</p>
<p>Before Governor Hunter's departure, and in accordance with
orders from Home, Major Joseph Foveaux, of the New South Wales
Corps, was appointed Commandant of Norfolk Island, and assumed
the Government in July, 1800. Matters where in a bad way in the
island. With the withdrawal of King's zeal and energy improvement
had ceased. The population had increased somewhat, but in all
other respects the settlement was steadily going back. Governor
Hunter, who touched at the island on his way to England in H.M.S.
<i>Buffalo</i> (October, 1800) to land sortie mutinous Irish
prisoners, gave a deplorable account of its condition. Its
appearance was most unpromising. All the buildings were in a
state of rapid decay, and but few signs of industry were visible.
The people were idle and refractory, the crops were mostly a
failure. All they could supply to the <i>Buffalo</i> was a few
hogs and some vegetables.</p>
<p>The sanguine hopes of King were doomed to disappointment. The
island had been at first occupied chiefly with a view to
developing the manufacture of New Zealand flax. This had proved a
complete failure. Much had been expected from the pine forests;
but the timber was found to be unfit for ship-building and too
brittle for spars, even if it had been possible for ships to lie
there and take it in. The soil was fertile, it is true, but from
the uncertainty of the climate and the many
plagues&mdash;drought, blight, and caterpillars&mdash;the crops
oftener than not yielded but a poor return. The project of
settling pensioners and expirees had proved abortive. The
soldiers and sailors were mostly too ignorant of farming to
succeed, and the inveterate idleness of the bulk of the settlers
of another class had been a still more insuperable obstacle to
their prosperity. Moreover, they were discontented and
disaffected, and laid the blame of all their misfortunes upon the
Government.</p>
<p>Governor Hunter was not alone in his opinion. Collins, who had
ample opportunities of forming a correct judgment, speaks in his
work on New South Wales of Norfolk Island as the place for
transporting offenders who had been again convicted in New South
Wales, and that this was more dreaded than the first
transportation. He thought that for this purpose it might be
continued as an alternative for the gallows, but as a settlement
the expense was quite disproportionate to any advantage to be
derived from it. From the reports of Flinders and Bass on the
climate, soil, and harbours of Van Diemen's Land, he thought that
territory would be found much more profitable than this parched
and inaccessible island.</p>
<p>Such was the condition of affairs when Major Foveaux took over
the command in July, 1800. Foveaux was not the man to cope with
the situation, or to infuse a spirit of order into a disorganised
society. As if with the intention of making his task more
difficult Governor King added a new trouble by banishing to the
island a number of the most turbulent of the Irishmen who had
been exiled to New South Wales for their participation in the
rising of 1798: they had given much trouble at Port Jackson
through their mutinous conduct, and it was thought that by
banishing the most turbulent to the distant settlement they could
be kept under better restraint. But in Norfolk Island society was
even more anarchial than in the principal colony, and there was
abundant opportunity for plotting. In December, 1800, a
conspiracy was discovered among the Irish, the object being to
overpower the officers, seize; the island, and escape. As the
Irish numbered only 36 men, while there was a force of 100
soldiers and 26 constables, the plot could scarcely have been
called formidable. But, if Foveaux was unable to preserve order,
he could at least take summary and barbarous vengeance. He
received full information of the plot on a Saturday evening. On
the Sunday morning the people went to church as usual. When
service was over all the Irish were ironed and put into gaol. At
two o'clock the Commandant had a gallows erected, and two of the
ringleaders, John Whollahan and Peter M'Lean, were brought out
and forthwith hanged without trial or examination.</p>
<p>In the memoirs of the so-called General Holt we have some
graphic sketches of the state of Norfolk Island under Major
Foveaux's government in 1804. Joseph Holt was a prominent leader
of the United Irishmen during the rising of 1798, and was
transported&mdash;or to speak correctly, exiled&mdash;to New
South Wales as a political prisoner. As a State prisoner Holt was
allowed full liberty in the Colony, and being a man of ability
and energy, attained a fairly comfortable position. At the time
of the Castle Hill rising in 1804, however, he came under
suspicion, more on account of his antecedents as a rebel leader
than from any actual proof of his complicity in the plot.
Governor King, however, made up his mind that Holt was a
dangerous character, and banished him to Norfolk Island. There is
no doubt that Holt's picture is strongly coloured by his
prejudices, and must be taken with large allowances, but the
account he gives of the arbitrary cruelty which reigned under
Foveaux is too surely corroborated from other sources to be very
far from the truth. As a political exile Holt was legally a free
man in New South Wales, though subject to certain restrictions.
He had not been convicted of any crime when exiled to Norfolk
Island, yet immediately on arrival he was clapped into gaol, and
by Foveaux's orders was illegally put into the working gang as a
convict. At first he refused to work, but, mindful of the
absolute power of the Commandant, who was sole judge and jury, he
finally submitted. For some three or four months he was kept in
the gang, in which the men were subjected to most brutal
treatment from the overseers. At length, under the combined
effect of severe labour and exposure and insufficient rations
Holt broke down, and in consequence of strong representations
from Surgeon D'Arcy Wentworth to Foveaux of the illegality of
this treatment, he was exempted from further labour and given his
liberty. He remained on the island for 15 months longer, until
Major Foveaux was succeeded in the command by Captain Piper. Holt
described Norfolk Island in these terms: "The dwelling of devils
in human shape, the refuse of Botany Bay, the doubly damned."</p>
<p>In spite of Governor King's partiality for the settlement he
had founded, it was becoming evident to the Home Authorities that
Norfolk Island was never likely to become a successful Colony,
and that it would always continue to be an expensive burden on
the Government. Dr. Lang, in his "History of New South Wales",
roundly charges King with having, from some interested motive,
done his best to discredit the settlement at the Colonial Office.
In the absence of any direct proof, and from the general tenor of
King's conduct with regard to the changes in the establishment,
this charge seems to be wholly without foundation. It is much
more probable that the views of such men as Hunter and Collins,
with the unsatisfactory reports of the condition of the
settlement, and its great expense, prompted the Home Government
to decide to reduce the establishment, if not to abandon the
island altogether.</p>
<p>At the same time, Governor King's urgent representations of
the danger which was impending over the new Colonies from the
designs of the French had roused the English Government to take
active measures to forestall them. In December, 1802, the Cabinet
had decided to form a settlement at Port Phillip, and in the
following April Colonel Collins' expedition had been despatched
for that purpose.</p>
<p>Still the Government was uneasy; and in June, 1803, Lord
Hobart wrote to Governor King that the position of Port Dalrymple
in Bass Strait rendered it particularly necessary, from a
political point of view, that an establishment should be placed
there, and directed him for that purpose to remove from Norfolk
Island a portion of the settlers and the convicts, and send them
to Port Dalrymple under the command of Lieut.-Col. Paterson, at
the same time recalling Major Foveaux to Sydney. Lord Hobart's
despatch did not arrive at Port Jackson until May, 1804, nearly
12 months after it was written. Collins having in the meantime
abandoned Port Phillip for the Derwent, the importance of
occupying a station in Bass Straits became more urgent, and King
at once applied himself to carry out his instructions respecting
the settlement of Port Dalrymple, which was eventually
accomplished by Paterson settling at George Town in November,
1804.</p>
<p>King did not show the same alacrity in complying with the
instructions respecting Norfolk Island. There is little doubt
that they were distasteful to him. He contented himself with
writing to Foveaux (26 June, 1804) that the establishment was to
be reduced, and that towards the end of the year he would send a
vessel or vessels to remove any settlers who were inclined to go
to the new colony at Port Dalrymple. At the same time he said
that he did not wish to force removal on any settlers who were
valuable and industrious, and who might be ruined by having to
give up their land after the expenditure of so much labour and
the endurance of so much hardship. Nor, on the other hand, did he
want the useless and idle, who might be only too willing to move.
Still, out of the 33 larger landholders there might be some who
would be willing to go, and they should be encouraged by the
offer of liberal terms. They and their stock would be removed at
the public expense, and what was necessarily left behind would be
taken by the Government at a valuation. On surrendering their
grants they were to have four acres for every acre cultivated at
Norfolk Island, and two acres for every acre of waste land. They
were to have rations for twelve months for themselves and their
households, and be allowed the labour of two convicts for the
same period. Of the 180 little occupiers there might be a few who
were worthy of encouragement and removal.</p>
<p>On the receipt of the Governor's instructions Foveaux
assembled the settlers (19th July, 1804), and laid the proposal
before them. It was well received, and some 40 at once gave, in
their names as ready to try their fortunes in Van Diemen's Land.
These 40 were free settlers, most of them being men who had been
either in the army or the navy. A considerable proportion held
grants of from 30 to 120 acres each. A few had flocks of sheep;
one, George Guest, as many as 600. Amongst those who were
strongly recommended by Foveaux as the most industrious and
Attest for selection we find the names of Daniel Stanfield,
Abraham Hand, John and Joseph Beresford, George Guest, Wm.
Pentony, Joseph Bullock, Edward Fisher, James Morrisby, and James
Belbin. The only stipulation they made was that they should be
allowed to wait until their crops were ripe, so as to take with
them their corn and maize, and not be wholly dependent on rations
from the public stores.</p>
<p>But the settlers soon repented of their hastly decision. When
the <i>Integrity</i> arrived from Sydney a fortnight later (4th
August) with further despatches from the Governor, and their
contents were communicated to two of the principal inhabitants,
out of the 41 who had sent in their names all but 10 withdrew. As
the settlers would not move voluntarily, and as King had no
instructions to use compulsory measures, the only thing left to
do was to reduce the establishment. Foveaux was of opinion that
such half measures were a mistake, and that the choice lay
between continuing the colony on its existing footing or
abandoning it altogether. To cut down salaries and discharge
officers would work great injustice to men who had spent
considerable sums in building houses and making improvements.
They must be compensated, and the saving effected would be
minute. But indeed, any material reduction would be impossible.
Courts of justice must be kept up, and there must be a sufficient
number of officers to make a jury, Governor King proposed sending
a vessel annually with officers to make a court, the vessel to
bring back salt pork for the supply of Port Jackson. But a court
once a year was quite insufficient, and their experience of
salting pork was not encouraging. The pork was often so badly
cured that it was useless for food, and the supply of swine could
not be depended on. Corn was absolutely necessary both for their
rearing and fattening, and the frequent scarcity of corn caused
great mortality. Indeed, the expectations formed of the island
were never likely to be realised. In 1801 there had been a famine
owing to the scarcity of grain and pork, and the inhabitants had
been dependent for food on fish. In 1802 the crops were better,
but since then they had either failed generally, or had been so
poor as hardly to reward the settlers' labour. But for the large
yield from Government land in 1802, large supplies would have
been required from Port Jackson. As it was, they had been obliged
to get afloat from Sydney, and even then could only allow a
reduced ration. Many of the settlers were in great distress, and
if the crops failed again&mdash;as indeed was afterwards the
case&mdash;they would be in absolute want.</p>
<p>Yet, in spite of all these disadvantages, many of the
settlers, especially those who had come over with the first
settlement, showed a great reluctance to move. They were attached
to their homes, and did not care again to face the difficulties
and privations which they would have to encounter in a new
settlement before they could get round them even such comforts
for their families as they had at Norfolk Island. If they knew
that the Government meant to abandon the settlement altogether,
probably they would be willing to remove. One of the greatest
obstacles was their debts. But perhaps the offer of greater
inducements might overcome their reluctance, and eventually they
would all benefit by the change.</p>
<p>Governor King had no authority to abandon the settlement, and
was probably only too pleased that the settlers whom he had
planted showed such an attachment to his favourite island, or at
least so much reluctance to leave it. It only remained for him to
make such reductions in the establishment as were possible. Some
of the civil officers were discharged and others transferred to
Port Dalrymple, the military guard was reduced by one-half, and
most of the convicts were withdrawn, some being removed to Port
Dalrymple and the remainder to Port Jackson. With the few small
vessels available for the service, the difficulty of approach to
the island, and the storms which on more than one occasion
disabled the badly found and unseaworthy ships, the removal of
even a small part of the people was a tedious business, extending
over many months. By the end of 1805 about 250 people had been
removed, leaving more than 700 still on the island. The stores
were for the most part transferred to Port Dalrymple and the
Derwent. A large quantity of the salt pork sent to the latter
settlement was condemned as unfit for human food.</p>
<p>In accordance with Lord Hobart's instructions, Major Foveaux
resigned his charge on 12th February, 1805, when the reductions
began. Captain John Piper, the senior military officer, took his
place as Commandant. If Holt is to be trusted, Captain Piper's
rule presented a favourable contrast to that of Foveaux, both in
the humanity and consideration he showed to those under him and
in his general conduct. To Piper was left the troublesome and
unpleasing task of superintending the removal of the settlers.
With but few exceptions they obstinately refused to stir. The
first to leave were five settlers who sailed with Foveaux to
Sydney, and thence preceeded to Paterson's Settlement at Port
Dalrymple, where they arrived in April, 1805. These were the
first Norfolk Islanders to settle in Van Diemen's Land. Paterson
wanted them to take up their locations on the Supply River on the
west bank of the Tamar; but they chose their allotments on a
creek two miles south-east of York Town. The soil on the hills
was bad, the flats were liable to floods. Their crops turned out
so poor that they threw up their locations, and Paterson
eventually gave them fresh grants in the fertile country on the
banks of the South Esk, somewhere in the neighbourhood of
Longford. Seven months later two more of the Norfolk Island
settlers found their way to the banks of the Tamar.</p>
<p>With a disabled little warship and a couple of small schooners
for his whole available fleet, King had to look for some chance
private ship to remove stores and people from Norfolk Island. In
September, 1805, the Sydney arrived at Port Jackson from India.
As she was bound to the Derwent for oil, King agreed with Captain
Forrest to touch at Norfolk Island on the way and take a cargo to
Collins' settlement. For this charter he paid the captain
&pound;600. He had by this time relented of his harshness to
Holt, and given him permission to leave his place of exile, so
that when the Sydney sailed from Norfolk Island on the 1st of
November, Holt took a passage in her and paid a visit to the new
settlement of which he has left us a lively account in his
journal. In the Sydney also there came the first Norfolk Island
settler to the Derwent&mdash;George Guest&mdash;who brought a
wife and six children and also 300 ewes, of which only 265
survived the three weeks' passage. Of 200 ewes belonging to
Government, shipped at the same time, only 148 were landed. Six
head of cattle arrived safely.</p>
<p>Thus, at the end of 1806, after the exertions of more than two
years, only eight settlers with their families had been prevailed
upon to remove to Van Diemen's Land. The convicts had been nearly
all withdrawn, the military guard reduced to 25 men, but there
were still 700 people on the island, a number nearly equal to the
combined population of the two recently founded settlements in
Van Diemen's Land, viz., Hobart, 471; Port Dalrymple, 301; total,
772. Lord Hobart's despatch ordering the deportation of the
settlers was dated June, 1803. If it had taken more than three
years to move eight settlers, how long would it take to remove
700? The Colonial Office was beginning to grow impatient,
especially as news had arrived that there was once more a bad
harvest at Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in December, 1806, the Secretary of State wrote a
peremptory despatch on the subject to Governor Bligh, who had
succeeded King as Governor of New South Wales. In this despatch
Lord Norfolk recapitulated the reasons which had led Lord Hobart
more than three years before to decide on the evacuation of the
island. He remarked with dissatisfaction that the measures
hitherto taken had had little effect in promoting the object of
freeing the Government from the expense of an unproductive
settlement; that it was plain that the crops were less
satisfactory each year, while the expenses were ever increasing;
that Port Jackson would soon be self-supporting, while Hobart
Town and Port Dalrymple appeared to have everything to recommend
them in regard to climate and fertility. It was now evident to
the Government that no advantage could arise from the partial
evacuation of Norfolk Island, and he therefore gave orders that
measures were to be taken forthwith for the withdrawal of all
settlers and stock and their removal to the new settlements in
Van Diemen's Land, on the terms recommended by Foveaux nearly two
years before, with certain modifications. The settlers were to be
compensated for what they had to leave behind, the money
compensation not to exceed &pound;1000, and they were to have
grants in the proportion of two acres only to one acre of
cultivated land surrendered. On the other hand they were to have
houses erected of value equal to those given up; were to be
victualled for two years at the public cost; those of the better
class were to be allowed the labour of four convicts for nine
months and of two for fifteen months, those of less desert being
allowed lesser privileges.</p>
<p>The deportation now began in earnest. H.M.S. <i>Porpoise</i>,
the armed tender <i>Lady Nelson</i>, and the <i>Estramina</i>
were to remove the people and their stock. Governor Bligh gave
the settlers their choice between Port Dalrymple and the Derwent.
Most of them chose the latter settlement. He then gave Collins
notice to be ready to receive 120 settlers and their families,
386 souls in all, and at the same time sent him seven months'
supplies.</p>
<p>The first vessel to arrive (28th November, 1807) was the armed
tender <i>Lady Nelson</i>. She was already well known at the
Derwent. In 1803 she had brought to Risdon a portion of Bowen's
party, and had assisted at the founding of Hobart by Collins in
February, 1804, and she now brought the first detachment of
settlers deported from, Norfolk Island. They consisted of 15
families, comprising 34 persons. Three months later (17th
January, 1808) came the <i>Porpoise</i> with 43 families,
altogether 187 persons, and on the 2nd March the <i>Lady
Nelson</i> brought a further instalment of 50. Another three
months saw the <i>Estramina</i> arrive with an additional 62.
Thus in little more than six months Collins had had 330 people
thrown on his hands with but little means to provide for their
wants. Many of them were in a most wretched condition, and,
immediately applied to Collins for clothing and bedding, which it
was not in his power to give them. They had come with the
expectation that all their wants would be provided for by the
Government. All Collins could do was to billet the majority
amongst the inhabitants. Some few he assisted to build houses for
themselves. Some few he found sufficiently skilled to be employed
at wages on the works he had then in hand, the principal of which
was the large brick store which still stands at the bottom of
Macquarie-street. Some of the new arrivals received their grants
of land in the neighbourhood of the settlement at Sandy Bay, but
the greater part were fixed some 20 or 30 miles up the river, at
a new settlement which, in memory of their old home, was called
New Norfolk. The sudden accession of over 300 people to a small
community which did not number 500 was a great strain on Collins'
resources. His supplies were scanty enough, and when he learned
that still more people were coming, and that he was to have
thrust upon him more than double the number which Bligh had led
him to expect, he was loud in his complaints both to the Home
Authorities and to Sydney at the want of thought with which he
had been treated.</p>
<p>In the meantime a little revolution had taken place in Sydney.
Governor Bligh had been deposed by the officers of the New South
Wales Corps, and the government had been assumed by Colonel
Johnston. The work of removal from Norfolk Island was then pushed
on even more rapidly. Colonel Johnston chartered the <i>City of
Edinburgh</i>, a vessel of 500 tons, to remove the rest of the
settlers. The deposed Bligh, in his despatches to the Secretary
of State, protested strongly against the folly of crowding a host
of people into a settlement so ill prepared to receive them, a
proceeding which must, he foresaw, involve the whole population
at the Derwent in great distress.</p>
<p>Already there were loud complaints from the Norfolk Islanders
of the hardships they had had to endure, so different from what
they had been led to expect from the representations made to them
when they left the island. Many of them were in the most
destitute condition, and were glad to compound their claims
against the Government by taking a few live stock as compensation
for the houses and effects they had left. Probably, however,
their own improvident habits were their worst enemy. Foveaux
states that a ship named the Rose, belonging to Campbells, of
Sydney, had touched at the Derwent on her way from England. In
direct contravention of his orders from head quarters, Collins
allowed the Captain to land several thousand gallons of spirit
for sale. He further permitted it to be sold to the new arrivals,
who parted with their little store of salted pork to the
Government store to raise money to purchase the spirits. Thus,
many in a few days dissipated the whole of their small means of
subsistence.</p>
<p>The <i>City of Edinburgh</i> sailed from Sydney to remove the
rest of the settlers on the 26th May, 1808; she met with a
succession of heavy gales, and was repeatedly blown off the
island, so that she did not complete her loading for more than
three months; she sailed from the island on the 9th September,
carrying 226 people to the already overcrowded settlement at the
Derwent, where she arrived on the 2nd October. The unfortunate
people suffered much on the long voyage of nearly a month, and
complained that they had been plundered on the way of much of
their small property. The greater number were in a most destitute
state&mdash;almost naked&mdash;and their arrival necessarily
increased the prevailing distress at Hobart. The population of
the settlement had been more than doubled by the 554 people who
had come from Norfolk Island, and now stood at over 1000. Floods
on the Hawkesbury in New South Wales had destroyed nearly the
whole crops in March, 1808, and the Governor at Port Jackson
could spare nothing in response to Collins' urgent appeals for
help.</p>
<p>It is true that the Norfolk Islanders had brought some store
of provisions, but a quite insufficient supply, and the Derwent
settlement, as yet, produced practically nothing. In view of his
probable necessities Collins sometime before had made an
agreement with Campbell, of Sydney, to bring him 500 head of
Bengal cattle from India, but Lieut .-Governor Foveaux had set
aside the contract as too costly, which was perhaps wise, as the
shipment would have cost the English Exchequer some
&pound;20,000.</p>
<p>The Derwent settlement was now in great straits for food. The
ration of salt meat had long since been reduced to one-half.
There were only a few weeks' full rations in hand, and starvation
was staring them in the face. Collins got some few stores from
the rare vessels which touched at Van Diemen's Land, but this was
a mere trifle. His only resource was to fall back on what the
bush yielded. He, therefore, issued an order offering U\ per lb.
for all the kangaroo meat brought into store.</p>
<p>For the next year or two it was a struggle at Hobart Town for
bare existence, and the people were on the verge of absolute
starvation.</p>
<p>Lieut. Edward Lord, in his evidence before a Committee of the
House of Commons in 1812, said that the whole settlement for a
considerable time lived on kangaroo, not having a bit of other
provisions. He says:&mdash;"During the great scarcity, when we
lived for 13 months, except at small intervals, upon 2 lbs. of
biscuit per week, we had not a single death. We were living on
the wild game of the country. The people certainly suffered
inconvenience and very great privations from want of provisions.
I have often myself been glad to go to bed from want of bread,
and have often been without the little comforts of wine and
sugar."</p>
<p>Kangaroo meat brought 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per lb. Later the
Sydney was chartered to bring wheat from India, but she was
wrecked. The <i>Venus</i>, Capt. Bunker, was then despatched. She
was more fortunate, arriving in 1810 with a cargo of wheat, which
at last relieved the inhabitants from their dread of famine.
Wheat sank from &pound;4, or even &pound;6 per bushel, to
12<i>s</i>.</p>
<p>With respect to Norfolk. Island, it was found undesirable, if
not impossible, to abandon it entirely. There was still a herd of
cattle and also some 3000 sheep which could not be at once
removed. A small party was to be left to look after the stock and
to try whether it was possible to cultivate coffee. Captain Piper
reports, 30 Sept., 1808, after sailing of the City of Edinburgh,
that there were still 250 persons on the island.</p>
<p>From the report of the Parliamentary Committee above quoted it
appears that in 1812 the Island was not wholly deserted. There
were still a few settlers and some soldiers. A Return, dated 30
April, 1810, shows 98 free persons (of whom 61 were men) and 26
convicts, the military and officers numbering 53; total, 177.</p>
<p>The settlers from Norfolk Island were given lands at New
Norfolk and Sandy Bay, at Pittwater (Sorell), and Clarence plains
in the South, and at Norfolk plains on the Northern side of the
island. These grants were at first small, seldom exceeding 40
acres. A certain proportion, of the Norfolk
Islanders&mdash;especially the marines and sailors who came out
with Governor Phillip in 1788, and went to the island with King,
and some of the crew of the <i>Sirius</i>&mdash;who had prospered
in Norfolk Island, prospered also in Van Diemen's Land, and their
families have continued to hold respectable and honourable
positions in this Colony. But, as a rule, the Norfolk Island
settlers did not add much to the welfare and progress of the
settlement at the Derwent.</p>
<p>The great majority, idle and improvident in their old home,
did not improve by removal. They were content to draw their
rations from the stores so long as that privilege was allowed
them, and then bartered away their grants for a trifle, to sink
out of sight in poverty and wretchedness.</p>

<h3>THE DISCOVERY OF VAN DIEMEN'S LAND, IN 1642; WITH NOTES ON
THE LOCALITIES MENTIONED IN TASMAN'S JOURNAL OF THE VOYAGE.</h3>
<p align="center"><small>BY JAMES BACKHOUSE
WALKER.</small><br></p>
<p><small>ABEL</small> Janszoon Tasman was unquestionably one of
the greatest, if not the greatest, of the navigators between
Magellan, who in the early years of the 16th century first
crossed the Pacific Ocean, and Cook, who in the latter years of
the 18th practically opened Oceania and Australia to Europe.</p>
<p>Little is known of Tasman's personal history, except that he
was born about the year 1602, at Hoorn on the Zuyder Zee, a
seaport which produced many another hardy navigator. Tasman has
made familiar in our seas the name of one of these fellow
townsmen, the Corneliszoon Schouten, who in 1616 doubled the
Gape, afterwards called the Horn in honour of the birthplace of
its discoverer.</p>
<p>That Tasman's merit has not received due recognition, and that
his fame has not been as wide as his achievements deserved, is
the fault of his own countrymen. In the 16th and 17th centuries
the persistent policy of the Dutch was to conceal the discoveries
of their navigators, and suppress their charts, for fear other
nations should reap advantage from the knowledge and rival them
in the eastern seas. In later times when this motive had lost its
force, Tasman's countrymen were strangely indifferent to the
honour which their great sailor had won for his native land. Of
his second voyage in 1644&mdash;in which he explored the northern
coast of Australia, and laid down with painstaking accuracy the
shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria&mdash;we have to this day only
meagre hints and the record contained in a sketch map. Of his
more famous voyage to the Great Southland in 1642&mdash;in which
he discovered Tasmania and New Zealand, and made a great step
towards solving the vexed problem of the fancied Terra
Australis&mdash;the journal remained unpublished for more than
two centuries. It is true that a short abstract of this voyage
was published in Holland late in the 17th century, and was
shortly afterwards translated into English, and included in
several collections of voyages made by English and French
editors, and that Valentyn, in his great work on the Dutch East
Indies published in 1726, gave a more extended account,
illustrated by copies of Tasman's maps and sketches. But the
journal itself remained practically unknown until a copy of it
and of the original sketches and charts was discovered in London
in 1776 and purchased for half a guinea. This MS. afterwards came
into the possession of Sir Joseph Banks, and he employed the Rev.
C. G. Woide, a Dutch clergyman living in London, to make a
translation of it. Thirty years later the substance of this
translation was printed by Dr. Burney in his "History of
Discovery in the South Sea", published in 1814. Woide's MS. is
now in the British Museum, and a verbatim copy of the part
relating to our island has lately been made by Mr. Bonwick for
the Tasmanian Government. In Tasman's own country his original
journal remained neglected for more than two centuries, until in
the year 1860 it was printed <i>in extenso</i> at Amsterdam, under the
editorship of Mr. Jacob Swart.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Journaal van de reis naar net onbekende
Zuidland in den jare 1642, door Abel Jansz, Tasman; medegedeeld

<p>Tasman's expedition was probably the first systematic attempt
made by the Dutch to explore the Great South Land. In the early
years of the 17th century the Western Coast of Australia had been
several times sighted by Dutch Captains. Ships, bound for the
Dutch settlements at Batavia, had been driven to the southward by
storms, and the resulting discoveries had, therefore, been to a
large extent involuntary, or at least accidental. In the year
1642, however, the Governor-General Anthony Van Diemen, and the
Council of Netherlands-India, determined to despatch from Batavia
a properly equipped expedition, having for its sole object the
discovery of the Great Southern Continent. The instructions to
the commander, prepared by their direction, have been preserved.
They contain a detailed statement of all that was then known by
the Dutch of the geography of those parts, and they prescribe the
course that the ships were to pursue. The command of the
expedition was entrusted to Tasman, then 40 years old, and the
ship <i>Heemskerk</i> was assigned to him for the service, with
the little fly-boat <i>Zeehan</i> as tender. Tasman sailed from
Batavia on August 14; reached Mauritius (then a Dutch settlement)
on September 5, and sailed thence for the South on October 5. He
held a S.E. course until on November 6 he had reached 100 deg. E.
long, in lat. 49 deg. S., without finding any signs of the
supposed continent. A council of officers was held, and the chief
pilot, Francis Jacobsen, advised that the course should be
altered, and that the ships should make for lat. 44 deg. S. until
130 deg. E. lon. was reached, then, if no mainland was met with,
they should sail into 40 deg. E. lat., and steer on that parallel
until they reached 200 deg. E. long. By this course he thought
they would be sure to fall in with islands, and having so far
solved the problem of the great southern continent, he advised
that they should stand north for the Solomon Islands, whence they
might shape their course for home. By the middle of November they
came to the conclusion that they had passed the extreme limits of
the supposed continent, but on the 24th of the month land was
seen bearing east by north, distant 10 Dutch miles (40 miles
English). Unlike the invariable low sandy shore which former
captains had described as characteristic of the Great Southland,
the country before them was mountainous, and clothed with dark
forest. Tasman says: "This is the furthest land in the South Sea
we met with, and as it has not yet been known to any European we
called it Anthony Van Diemen's Land, in honour of the
Governor-General, our master, who sent us out to make
discoveries. The islands round about, as many as were known to
us, we named in honour of the Council of India." They skirted the
newly discovered land, and on December 1 came to an anchor in a
bay on the east coast. On December 3 they weighed anchor and
sailed north until they reached a point about St. Patrick's Head,
from whence they stood away eastward to make new discoveries.
After eight days they sighted land, which Tasman called Staten
Land, thinking that it might be part of the Southern continent
and joined to Staten Land, east of Tierra del Fuego. (When this
supposition was shortly afterwards shown to be an error,* the
name was changed to that of New Zealand.) After a fatal encounter
with the Maoris, Tasman sailed along the west coast of New
Zealand to Cape Maria Van Diemen, and thence took a north-east
course, discovering Amsterdam and other islands, and after
skirting the north coast of New Guinea, he returned to Batavia.
In his second voyage in 1644, Tasman again sailed from Batavia
and explored the west, north-west, and north coasts of Australia,
the Gulf of Carpentaria, and the south coast of New Guinea. Thus
in the two voyages, though he left the question of the existence
of a southern continent still unsolved, he had made the first
complete circumnavigation of Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p class="foot">[* By the voyage of Brouwer round Cape Horn in
1643.]</p>
<p>We may now turn our attention to identifying the parts of the
coast of our island which were sighted by Tasman. The difficulty
is that his longitudes are very uncertain, and his latitudes,
though less variable, do not agree with modern observations,
being in general some 9 or 10 miles too southerly.** His
longitudes are quite hopeless. Their uncertainty is shown by the
fact that he makes a difference of 3 deg. 40 min. between the
west coast and Frederick Henry Bay, while the true difference is
only 2 deg. 48 min.&mdash;an error of 52, or nearly a degree in
that short distance. Many of his positions are stated to have
been estimated by reckoning, and we know that in those days the
ascertainment of longitude by observation was always very
uncertain.</p>
<p class="foot">[** This conclusion is reached by a comparison of
the latitudes shown on his chart for his anchorage on the east
coast, for Maria Island, the Friars, and Maatsuyker Island. On
the other hand, he gives the latitude of the point where he
approached close to shore as 42 deg. 30 min., the true latitude
of Point Hibbs being 42 deg. 38 min.]</p>
<p>It is generally stated that the first land sighted by Tasman
was near Point Hibbs, and his little chart of Van Diemen's Land
appears to favour this opinion, but an examination of his journal
leads us to a different conclusion. From the entries in the
journal it is evident that his position on November 24, when he
first saw the land, is not laid down on the chart at all. The
latitude entered for noon that day is 42 deg. 25 min. As the
weather was clear this was probably the observed latitude, and
making allowance for the usual error we may place it some miles
more to the north, say 42 deg. 20 min. or 42 deg. 15 min. From
noon he sailed four hours E. by N. before he sighted land bearing
E. by N. 40 English miles distant. When evening fell some three
hours later this course would have brought him to a latitude a
little to the northward of Cape Sorell (42 deg. 12 min.) This
position would agree very well with his description of the land
as he saw it on that evening, and which he describes as "very
high". "Towards evening we saw three high mountains to the E.S.E.
and to the N.E. We also saw two mountains, but not so high as
those to the southward."</p>

<br>
<p>Flinders in his circumnavigation of the island identified the
two mountains to the N.E. as those named by him Heemskirk and
Zeehan, after Tasman's ship. They are visible at about 30 miles
distance. Now, with Heemskirk and Zeehan bearing N.E., at a
distance of say 20 miles, Mount Sorell, the southern peaks of the
West Coast Range, and the Frenchman's Cap, would be nearly
E.S.E., while the centre of the West Coast Range, seen over the
low sandy foreshore north of Macquarie Harbour, would fit
Tasman's description of the very high land in front of him. If
the land near Point Hibbs had been first sighted, Mount Heemskirk
would have been at least 50 miles distant, and not visible. It is
therefore probable that the first land seen by the Dutch
navigator was the mountainous country to the north of Macquarie
Harbour. Without further observation the point must remain
doubtful, but when we get the much-needed and long-expected
Admiralty survey of the West Coast it will doubtless be possible
to fix precisely the spot of Tasman's landfall.</p>
<p>When the shades of evening fell over the strange shore they
had just discovered it was deemed prudent to run out to sea
during the night, and when morning broke the land was far
distant. The breeze had died away, and it was noon before they
had enough wind to run in again towards the shore. By 5 in the
evening they were within 12 miles of the land, and they kept on
their course until within one Dutch mile (4 English miles) of
what was without doubt Point Hibbs.</p>
<p>This was the opinion of Flinders, than whom there could be no
higher authority on such a question, and Tasman's sketch, rough
as it is, seems conclusive. Point Hibbs is there laid down as an
island, but its distinctive form&mdash;unlike any point lying to
the northward&mdash;is correctly shown.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The only difficulty in reconciling the
positions of the two days (Nov. 24 and 25) lies in the fact that
the difference of latitude given in the journal is 5 min. only.
The difference of latitude between Cape Sorell, where we suppose
him to have been on the first evening, and Point Hibbs, where he
certainly was on the second, is 26 miles. The discrepancy may,
however, be accounted for. On the second day they had southerly
wind and thick weather, and probably got no observation. They had
been standing off and on for 24 hours, and currents unknown to
them would probably lead to error in estimating their position.
The probability of error in Tasman's latitude is increased by the
fact that he makes the latitude 42 deg. 30 min. instead of 42
deg. 38 min., the error being too northerly instead of too
southerly, as usual.]</p>
<p>The ships stood out to sea again and sailed south-east in
thick, foggy weather, in which only glimpses of the coast were
obtained. Tasman took some of the high headlands and mountains
about Port Davey for islands, calling them De Witt and Sweers
Islands. Then he rounded the South-West Cape, and named the
Maatsuyker Islands, passing close to a small island about 12
miles from the mainland which looked like a lion, and which was
identified afterwards by Flinders as the rock named by Furneaux
the Mewstone. Thence he passed between the mainland and a rock
which he named Pedra Branca ** (White Rock) from its resemblance
to Pedra Branca off the coast of China, and sailed past the
entrance of D'Entrecasteaux Channel without entering it, though
in his chart he marks an opening in the coast. Hounding the
Friars (which he called Boreels Isles) on November 29 he bore up
for a large bay, intending to anchor there. When he had almost
reached his intended anchorage *** a heavy storm arose, and he
was driven out so far to sea that next morning he could hardly
discern the land. It was from this incident that Storm Bay got
its name. When the wind moderated he continued his easterly
course, and rounding Tasman's Island (the Pillar) he turned
northward along the east coast of Tasman's and Forestier's
Peninsulas until, on December 1, an hour after sunset, he came to
anchor in a good port in 22 fathoms, the bottom fine, light-grey,
sand. "Wherefore", says Tasman piously, "we ought to lift up
thankful hearts to Almighty God." The position of this anchorage,
as shown in Tasman's chart, is north-west of the rocky islet now
called Green Island, just north of the basaltic cliffs of Cape
Frederick Henry.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Known to our fishermen as "Peter's
Bank".]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The anchorage he aimed at was the same where
Furneaux anchored in 1773, and which he named Adventure Bay.]</p>
<p>On December 2, early in the morning, the boat was sent to
explore, and entered a bay a good 4 miles to the north-west
(Blackman's Bay). The boat was absent all day, and returned in
the evening with a quantity of green-stuff which was found fit to
cook for vegetables. The crew reported that they had rowed some
miles after passing through the entrance to the bay (now known as
the Narrows). They had heard human voices, and a sound like a
trumpet or small gong (probably a cooey), but had seen no one.
They saw trees from 12 to 15 feet round, and 60 to 65 feet up to
the first branch. In the bark of these trees steps had been
hacked with a flint for the purpose of climbing to the birds'
nests. From the steps being five feet apart they inferred that
the natives were either very tall,* or had some unknown method of
climbing. The forest was thin and unencumbered by scrub, and many
of the tree trunks were deeply burnt by fire. In the bay were
great numbers of gulls, ducks, and geese. At various times during
the day both the boats' crews and the people on board the ships
had seen smoke rising from different points on shore, "so that
without doubt in this place must be men, and these of uncommon
height."</p>
<p class="foot">[* The early navigators had a fixed idea that
these southern lands were inhabited by giants. At the Three
Kings, north of New Zealand, Tasman describes the men they saw
walking on the shore as being of gigantic stature.]</p>
<p>The next day (Dec. 3) the boats went to the south-east corner
of the bay in which the ships were anchored, in order to get
fresh water, but, though they found a lagoon, the shore was so
low that the waves had broken through, and the water was too
brackish for use. The wind blew strongly from the east and
south-east, and in the afternoon, when they again tried to effect
a landing with the boats, the sea ran so high that one boat was
obliged to return to the ship. The other larger boat, under the
command of Tasman himself, made for a little bay to the W.S.W. of
the ships, but the sea was too rough to allow of landing. The
carpenter, Peter Jacobsen, volunteered to swim ashore with a pole
on which was the Prince's flag. He planted the flag-pole in the
ground on the shore of the bay, and thus Tasman took possession
of our island for the Dutch.</p>
<p>Next morning at daybreak (Dec. 4), the storm having subsided,
and the wind blowing off shore, they weighed anchor and stood to
the northward, passing Maria Island and Schouten Island, so named
by Tasman after his fellow-townsman of the good port of
Hoorn.</p>
<p>On the following morning (Dec. 5), he took his departure from
a high round mountain (St. Patrick's Head) and stood away to the
eastward to make fresh discoveries.</p>
<p>Of the localities associated with the discovery of this
island, the one round which the chief interest centres is
Frederick Henry Bay and its neighbourhood. The name has been
dislocated from its rightful position on the map, and has been
transferred to another part of the coast, where it is now fixed by
long usage. Tasman never saw what is now popularly known as
Frederick Henry Bay. The bay to which he gave the name of the
Stadtholder of Holland was in the immediate vicinity of his
anchorage on the north-east coast of Forestier's Peninsula. Its
exact locality the records of the voyage leave a little doubtful.
The journal contains no names of places, but the account of the
planting of the flag would lead to the inference that he gave the
Prince's * name to the bay in which his ships lay at anchor, on
the shore of which the Prince's flag was set up, and which is now
known as Marion Bay. The charts, however, lead rather to the
conclusion that it is the inner port or arm of the sea (now
Blackman's Bay) which is the true Bay of Frederik Hendrik. The
copy of the map in Burney leaves the point doubtful, the name
being written on the land between the two ports. But in the chart
as reproduced by Vallentyn, and stated to have been copied by him
from the original journal, the name is distinctly written in
Blackman's Bay. On the whole, therefore, it seems probable that
this is the Frederik Hendrik Bay of Tasman.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Prince Frederik Hendrik of Orange was
Stadtholder of Holland from 1625 to 1647. He was the grandfather
of William of Orange, afterwards William <small>III</small>. of
England.]</p>
<p>The eastern shore of Forestier's Peninsula is wild and rugged,
and scarcely known except to the hardy fishermen who, in their
trips northward along the coast, fish in its quiet nooks, or run
for shelter into the beautiful inlet of Wilmot Harbour. With the
exception of a solitary shepherd's dwelling on the shore of this
harbour&mdash;locally known as Lagoon Bay&mdash;the eastern part
of the Peninsula is uninhabited, and so difficult of access that
it is seldom visited. In the early part of 1889 I had an
opportunity of thoroughly exploring a locality which must alway
be of interest as the spot where the sailors of the great
Dutchman first set foot on the island which bears his name.</p>
<p>Our party&mdash;which included my friend Mr. R. M.
Johnston&mdash;left East Bay Neck in a fishing-boat to camp at
Chinaman's Point just within "The Narrows", or entrance of
Blackman's Bay. During the time of our ten days' camping we
cruised in our boat over the great bay outside, seeing the coast
from the point of view which Tasman occupied when the
<i>Heemskerk</i> lay at anchor off rocky little Green Island. We
could thus realise the scene, unaltered after two centuries and a
half, which presented itself to the old navigator when he caught
his first near view of the picturesque shores of this outpost of
the Great South Land, the mysterious continent of his search. To
the south stood the jutting basaltic columns of Cape Frederick
Henry&mdash;a lesser Cape Raoul&mdash;backed by the high round of
Humper's Bluff. Thence his eye travelled northward round twenty
miles of curving shore, its white beaches broken here and there
by dark cliffs and rocky points. On the north, beyond the long
stretch of white sand barring Blackman's Bay, rose steep-wooded
hills, buttressed at their eastern end by the abrupt mass of Cape
Bernier, thrusting its almost precipitous slope into the ocean,
and flanked by the hills of Maria Island, shutting in the great
bay on the north-east. The coast view from the offing is fine,
but if the visitor wishes to appreciate fully the picturesqueness
of the shore, and to identify the spots mentioned in the quaint
old Dutch journal, he must be prepared for some rough scrambing
on the Peninsula itself. The country inland is poor, almost
without water, covered with thin gum forest, scrub, and meagre
grass. It is only the shore that is interesting. The rocky
headlands, cliffs, and islands, against which the ocean dashes,
are rent and scarred by sudden fissures and chasms, into which
the waves rush roaring and tumbling. Between the points lie a
variety of lovely bays; now a broad white beach with long rollers
of breaking surf, now a rocky nook, now a quiet and sheltered
cove.</p>
<p>Our centre of observation was the camping ground within "The
Narrows", from whence we looked out over the broad expanse of
Blackman's Bay. This extensive inlet or arm of the sea is shallow
and full of shoals and sandbanks, which make the navigation even
of a boat dangerous to the inexperienced. It is shut in from the
sea by a long tongue of land and by shoals, leaving only a small
outlet, very appropriately called "The Narrows", through which
the tide rushes with great force. Early on the first morning
after the ships had come to an anchor the two boats, under the
command of Pilot Francis Jacobszoon, rowed through this narrow
inlet to explore the new-found country. The Pilot's description
of the watering places, where the water trickled so slowly that
they could with difficulty fill a bowl, is thoroughly
characteristic of the eastern shores of Blackman's Bay. In the
evening Pilot Jacobszoon returned on board with his collection of
strange vegetables, and his report of the well-wooded country,
the great trees scarred by fire, with marks on their bark of the
steps of gigantic climbers, whom they had not seen, but whose
mysterious voices they had heard.</p>
<p>The various localities mentioned in Tasman's journal were
easily reached from our camp. Outside "The Narrows" the shore
rises in high cliffs, at the foot of which a broad rocky shelf
affords access to little nooks, which, in the early days of the
colony, were the sites of stations for bay whaling, and are still
known as Gardiner's and Watson's Fisheries. Some two miles from
"The Narrows" is Cape Paul Lamanon. A fishing excursion to the
neighbourhood gave me an apportunity of landing on the Cape. It
is a low point, the soil of which is stony and arid, covered with
small timber and rough scrub. From the Cape a short walk took me
to the little cove marked on the maps as Prince of Wales Bay. It
was on the shore of this little cove (<i>cleene bochtien</i>),
situated to the west-south-west of Tasman's anchorage, that the
Dutch flag was planted two centuries and a half ago. The shores
of the bay on each side of the entrance are rocky and broken, but
further in the rocks give place to a beach of large grey shingle.
As you advance along the shore up the bay the banks of shingle on
each side curve into two horns shelving out towards the centre of
the bay, and forming a bar extending nearly the whole way across
the entrance to the inner cove. Within the bar of shingle lies
enclosed a lovely cove, its quiet waters fringed by a curved
beach of great smooth stones. On either hand it is shut in by
steep banks crowned with dark forest, and from the steep grey
beach at the bottom of the cove a wooded valley runs inland.
Standing just outside the shingle bar at the entrance to this
inner harbour it needs no great effort of the imagination to call
up the scene on that 3rd December, 1642. Away out in the offing,
near yonder grotesquely shaped Green Island, the high-pooped old
Dutch ships lie at anchor. The wind is blowing fresh from the
eastward, and two boats put off from the ships and stand for the
shore. The wind increases to half a gale, and while the smaller
boat runs back to the ships the larger boat changes her course
and heads for this bay. As she approaches we can see on board of
her Tasman himself, and some of the <i>Heemskerk</i>'s officers;
Gerrit Janszoon, the master; Abraham Coomans, the supercargo; and
Peter Jacobszoon, the carpenter. The surf breaks violently on the
shingle, and Tasman finds that to land in such a sea is
impossible without great danger of wrecking the boat. Must he,
then, after all, sail away without taking formal possession of
the newly-discovered land? There is a short deliberation as the
rowers rest on their oars, and then the carpenter, Jacobszoon,
hastily throws off his clothes, plunges into the sea, and,
pushing his flag-pole before him, strikes out for the shore.
Making his way through the breaking surf he lands on the shingle
beach, and there, at the foot of the steep slope, where four
stately gums stand in a crescent on the hill side, he plants the
flag of the Prince Stadtholder. We can imagine the cheer which
greeted the raising of the flag as the carpenter, in the name of
the States-General, thus took possession of the new territory of
the Great South Land. Then the boat is brought as close in to the
shore as possible, the carpenter swims out to her again through
the surf, and they return on board the <i>Heemskerk</i>. "Leaving
the flag", says Tasman, "as a memento to posterity and to the
inhabitants of the country, who, though they did not show
themselves, we thought were not far off, carefully watching the
proceedings of the invaders of their territory."</p>
<p>Another place of interest on this coast to which we paid a
visit is Wilmot Harbour, locally known as Lagoon Bay, a deep cove
to the south of the basaltic promontory of Cape Frederick Henry.
Here is the one solitary dwelling on this part of the Peninsula.
It is probably the only locality which has altered much in
appearance since the time of Tasman. Everywhere else the wild
bush remains untouched, but here is green pasture, and even a
small cornfield or two. The southern headland of the harbour is
one of the wildest and most picturesque of spots. Standing on the
grassy surface of its narrow extremity, which is rent into chasms
and fissures, you look down upon the sea breaking tumultuously
into a deep gulf below. On the other side of the gulf, to the
south, there rises abruptly out of the water the grassy and
wooded steep of a headland, with bold outline like Mount
Direction. Turning to the north you see at your feet two rocky
islands, their precipices crowned with wood and scrub, the waves
heaving and swirling round their bases. Across the mouth of the
harbour stand the basaltic columns of Cape Frederick
Henry&mdash;a lesser Cape Raoul. Beyond, over outlying rocks and
islets, is the place of Tasman's anchorage; while in the
distance, twelve or fifteen miles off across the sea, loom the
peaks of Maria Island.</p>
<p>On our return we took the way of the Two Mile Beach (the North
Bay of the maps). Behind the sandhills at the back of the beach
lies a large lagoon, which discharges its brackish waters by a
narrow sandy channel at the south corner of the beach. This is
the spot where Tasman's boat's crew landed&mdash;on the morning
after their exploration of Blackman's Bay&mdash;to search for
water, and where they found that the sea breaking through into
the lagoon had made the water too brackish for use. The spot is
easily identified from Tasman's description, and is probably
hardly altered in appearance by the lapse of two centuries and a
half. The beach is a fine stretch of broad white sand two miles
long, on which the great ocean rollers break splendidly, and is
backed by a line of low sandhills, behind which lies the
lagoon.</p>
<p>For more than a century after Tasman anchored off Green Island
no navigator ventured to follow him into the stormy seas that
wash the dark cliffs of the Great South Land. The first of the
moderns who sighted the coast, of Van Diemen's Land was the
French captain Marion du Fresne in 1772. Marion made the West
Coast a little to the south of Tasman's landfall, and, following
almost the same course as the earlier navigator, his ships, the
<i>Mascarin</i> and <i>Marquis de Castries</i>, on the 5th March,
1772, anchored at a spot somewhat to the north-west of the
<i>Heemskerk</i>'s anchorage in 1642. Marion took this to be the
Frederick Henry Bay of Tasmania, but, as we have already seen,
this was almost certainty an error, and since the visit of the
<i>Mascarin</i> the outer bay, as distinguished from the inner,
has borne on the charts the more appropriate designation of
Marion Bay. The description in the narrative of the voyage * is
not sufficiently exact to enable us to determine the precise spot
where the French landed, but it appears to have been on the Two
Mile Beach (North Bay of our present maps). On this beach it was
that the aborigines of Tasmania first came into contact with
Europeans. The meeting was an ill-omened one. The blacks resisted
the landing, and attacked Marion's party with stones and spears.
The French, in retaliation, fired upon them, killing one man and
wounding others. The ships lay at anchor in the bay for six days,
during which the French explored the country for a considerable
distance, searching for fresh water, and timber for spars, but
they saw nothing more of the natives after this first fatal
encounter. Being unable to find either good water or timber
suitable for his needs, Marion sailed on March 10 for New
Zealand, where he met his death in a treacherous attack on his
people by the Maoris.</p>

<p>The next navigator who visited the Tasmanian coast was Captain
Tobias Furneaux, Cook's second in command on his second voyage of
discovery. It is to Furneaux's blunders that the confusion
respecting Frederick Henry Bay is due. The two ships, the
<i>Resolution</i> and the <i>Adventure</i>, were separated by a
storm in latitude 50&deg; south, between the Cape and Australia.
Cook, in the <i>Resolution</i>, kept on his course for New
Zealand; Furneaux, in the <i>Adventure</i>, being short of water,
bore up for the land laid down by Tasman as Van Diemen's Land. On
March 9, 1773, Furneaux sighted the land at a point which he took
to be Tasman's South Cape. The point was, in fact, South West
Cape, and from this initial error the whole course of subsequent
blunders arose. From South West Cape he sailed eastward intending
to make Tasman's anchorage in Frederick Henry Bay. Reaching the
South Cape, he mistook it for the Boreel Islands, south of Bruny,
and mistook the entrance of D'Entrecasteaux Channel for Tasman's
Storm Bay. The south point of Bruny he mistook for Tasman's
Island (the Pillar), and called it Tasman's Head. Rounding Bruny
Island he stood north, under the impression that he was sailing
along the east coast of Van Diemen's Land, and in the evening
came to an anchor in a bay of which he says&mdash;"We at first
took this bay to be that which Tasman called Frederick Henry Bay,
but afterwards found that his is laid down five leagues to the
northward of this." Furneaux named his anchorage Adventure Bay,
the point to the north he called Cape Frederick
Henry&mdash;believing that Tasman's Frederick Henry Bay lay to
the north of this cape&mdash;and the opposite shore of Tasman's
Peninsula he laid down on his chart as Maria's Isles. After five
days' stay in Adventure Bay, he sailed out and rounded the
Pillar, under the impression that he was rounding the south point
of Maria Island. Thence he proceeded north as far as the Furneaux
Group, and then bore away for New Zealand to rejoin Cook.</p>
<p>Cook, on his third voyage, cast anchor in Adventure Bay on
January 24, 1877, without detecting Furneaux's mistake or
correcting his charts.</p>
<p>In 1789, Captain J. H. Cox, in the brig <i>Mercury</i>,
anchored in the strait between Maria Island and the mainland,
but, misled by the charts of Furneaux and Cook, never suspected
that he was within a few miles of Tasman's Frederick Henry
Bay.</p>
<p>In April, 1792, Admiral D'Entrecasteaux, with the ships
<i>Recherche</i> and <i>Esperance</i>, sighted the Mewstone, and
bore up for the mainland, intending to make Cook's anchorage in
Adventure Bay. Through an error of his pilot, instead of rounding
Bruny Island, he stood to the west of it, and found that he was
not in Adventure Bay, but in the entrance of the channel, which
he (like Cook) believed to be the Storm Bay of Tasman.
D'Entrecasteaux explored the channel which bears his name,
ascended our river, which he named Rivi&egrave;re du Nord, and
explored the wide bay to the north-east, which he named Baie du
Nord. This bay, he thought, communicated with Tasman's Frederick
Henry Bay on the east coast, and under this impression the land
which Cook had erroneously laid down as Maria Island he named Ile
d'Abel Tasman.</p>
<p>In 1794, Capt. John Hayes, in the ships <i>Duke of
Clarence</i> and <i>Duchess</i>, visited Storm Bay&mdash;although
the name does not appear on his charts.* He evidently had only
Cook's chart, since he places Adventure Bay, Tasman's Head, and
Maria's Isles as they are laid down by Cook. Capt. Hayes re-named
all the other localities in Storm Bay, and it is to him that we
owe the name of the River Derwent. The Baie du Nord of
D'Entrecasteaux he called Henshaw's Bay.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Mr. A. Mault's paper, with <i>fac
simile</i> of Hay's chart, in the Society's Papers and
Proceedings for 1889.]</p>
<p>In December, 1798, Flinders and Bass, in their first
circumnavigation of the Island in the <i>Norfolk</i>, sailed up
Storm Bay and explored and surveyed the Baie du Nord of
D'Entrecasteaux. Flinders says that he was at the time quite
ignorant that this bay had ever been entered before, and, misled
by the errors of Furneaux and Cook, he laid it down on his first
sketch chart ** as Frederick Henry Bay.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See Mr. A. Mault's paper and <i>fac
simile</i> of chart, cited above.]</p>
<p>In January, 1802, the French discovery expedition under
Admiral Baudin, in the ships <i>G&eacute;ographe</i> and
<i>Naturaliste</i>, arrived in D'Entrecasteaux Channel. During a
stay of some weeks they completed the surveys of Admiral
D'Entrecasteaux, and explored and surveyed the Baie du Nord. They
then sailed for the east coast and anchored their ships in the
passage between Maria Island and the mainland. From this point
Freycinet, Baudin's lieutenant, made the first thorough
examination of Tasman's Frederik Hendrik Bay. He explored it as
far as East Bay Neck, and was thus enabled to correct the
mistakes of former navigators. He found that D'Entrecasteaux had
been mistaken in supposing that there was channel between
Frederick Henry Bay and the Baie du Nord, and that the supposed
Ile d'Abel Tasman was a double peninsula, to which he gave the
names of Forrestier's and Tasman's Peninsula (Presqu'ile d'Abel
Tasman). He also proved that Flinders *** had been in error in
applying the name Frederick Henry to the Baie du Nord. The charts
of Baudin's expedition, constructed by Faure, were the first to
show this coast accurately: in them for the first time the outer
port was laid down as Baie Marion, and the inner one as Baie
Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rick Hendrick.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** P&eacute;ron's narrative of Baudin's voyage
was published in 1807. The author had, therefore, the opportunity
of comparing Flinders' charts which were seized at the Mauritius
in 1803.]</p>
<p>Many years later, after his liberation from his long Mauritius
captivity, Flinders came to write his "Voyage to Terra
Australis". He had then had the opportunity of comparing his own
surveys of fifteen years before with the French charts, and
correcting his errors. In his atlas, therefore, the Baie du Nord
is correctly named North Bay, and the name of Frederick Henry Bay
is restored to its proper place on the east coast; though
Flinders applies it to the outer port and not to the inner, which
bears the name on Tasman's map.</p>
<p>The original error of Furneaux, perpetuated as it was by the
high authority of Cook and of Flinders' first chart, had obtained
too firm a hold to be displaced. On all the early English charts
the Baie du Nord was laid down as Frederick Henry Bay, and by
this name it is alluded to in all the early records; in Collins'
despatches;* in Knopwood's diary;** as such it continued to be
known to the early settlers, and so it is universally known to
the present day.</p>
<p class="foot">[* King to Collins, January 8, 1805; Collins to
King, June 24, 1805.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Knopwood's diary, February 12, 1804.]</p>
<p>After the publication of Flinders' atlas some of the early
map-makers endeavoured to restore the names to their proper
localities. Thus in a chart of Van Diemen's Land compiled by G.
W. Evans, Surveyor-General, and published in London in 1821, and
also in a chart published in London by Cross in 1826, North Bay
is correctly placed, and the name Frederick Henry is in the first
map applied to the outer bay, and in the second more correctly to
the inner one. In Assistant Surveyor-General Scott's map
published in Hobart by Boss in 1830, the name Frederick Henry
appears in North Bay, but in Arrowsmith's map published in London
in 1842, the alternative names are given, viz.&mdash;Frederick
Henry Bay <i>or</i> North Bay; while the name Frederick Henry
also appears correctly in the inner bay to which it was
originally applied by Tasman. In all modern maps, however,
D'Entrecasteaux's name of North Bay has been most inappropriately
transferred to what I have described as the Two Mile Beach, on
the east coast of Forestier's Peninsula.</p>
<p>The Fredrik Henrik Bay of Tasman is now known as Blackman's
Bay. On early maps the name of Blackman's Bay is applied
sometimes to the Two Miles Beach, and sometimes to Wilmot
Harbour. By what freak of the map-makers of our Survey Department
these names have been shuffled about so oddly I am quite at a
loss to imagine.</p>
<p>The names as they stand are perhaps now too firmly established
to be changed at once. But I would venture to offer to the Lands
Office two suggestions:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.) As there is already a Cape Frederick Henry on the east
coast of Forestier's Peninsula, which rightly marks Tasman's
anchorage, a more appropriate name should be given to the other
Cape Frederick Henry, forming the north point of Adventure Bay on
Bruny Island. Let the last-mentioned Cape bear the name of its
discoverer, and be re-christened "Cape Furneaux". This would
remove one source of misapprehension.</p>
<p>(2.) Though it may not be possible at once to restore the
correct names of the bays, yet they may be indicated without
causing confusion, and indeed with distinct advantage to the
popular apprehension of our history. In all future maps let the
names originally given be added in brackets. D'Entrecasteaux's
Baie du Nord would then appear as "Frederick Henry Bay <i>or</i>
North Bay", and in Blackman's Bay would also be added "Fredrik
Hendrik's Bay of Tasman".</p>
<p>Thus to perpetuate the remembrance of the landing-place of
Tasman would be a graceful act of justice to the memory of the
great seaman who, two centuries and a half ago, first
circumnavigated Australia, and has given his illustrious name to
this fair island of Tasmania.</p>

<h3>ABEL JANSZOON TASMAN:<br>
HIS LIFE AND VOYAGES.</h3>

<h4>INTRODUCTION.</h4>
<p><small>THE</small> modern era of maritime discovery may be
said to begin with the work of Prince Henry of Portugal, surnamed
"The Navigator" (1394-1460). Prince Henry devoted his life to the
furtherance of geographical discovery. He was inspired by the
hope of finding the sea-route to the East, and winning for his
country the rich trade of India and Cathay. During forty years he
sent out from Lagos fleet after fleet bound for the exploration
of the coasts of Africa. Further and further south, into the
unknown and dreaded Atlantic, his caravels pushed their way,
until, at his death, in 1460, his captains had reached the mouth
of the Gambia beyond Cape Verde, and had colonised the Azores.
The discoveries made under this Prince's inspiring influence were
the stepping-stone to the great voyages which marked the close of
the century. Following the initiative of Henry, the bold genius
of Columbus conceived the splendid idea of finding the East by
sailing west; and, in 1492, when he fell upon America, he
believed that he had reached the further shores of India. Five
years later, Henry's countryman, Vasco da Gama, in a voyage
almost as important as that of Columbus, doubled the Cape of Good
Hope, and opened the gates of the sea-way to Calicut and the
East. Pope Alexander the Sixth, by his famous Bull, apportioned
the world between the discoverers&mdash;allotting the western
half to Spain, and the eastern to Portugal. From that time the
gold and silver of the West were poured into the lap of Spain,
while Portugal gathered in as her sole property the rich profits
of the coveted trade of the East. For well nigh a century the two
nations Enjoyed a practical monopoly of the regions which the
daring of their sailors had won. Spain, in particular, through
the wealth she acquired from her American possessions, became the
dominant power in the world, and the mistress of the sea. Her
fall from that high eminence was due to her arrogant greed for
universal dominion, and her attempt to crush a free nation of
traders.</p>
<p>In the 15th and 16th centuries the Netherlands&mdash;the Low
Countries of common English parlance&mdash;were the most
prosperous nation in Europe. While other nations exhausted
themselves in war, they devoted themselves to the arts of peace.
In agriculture they were far, in advance of all other countries
of the time. The Flemish weavers were the first in the world, and
their looms supplied England and all Europe with the best linen
and woollen fabrics. In an age when salted provisions were almost
the sole winter diet of all classes, the fisheries of the North
Sea were nearly as important as the manufactures of Flanders.
These fisheries were well nigh monopolised by the Hollanders, and
were a rich mine of wealth to the northern towns, while they
trained a hardy and daring race of sailors. In addition to their
manufactures and their fisheries, the Dutch had become the
traders and carriers of the European world. It was Dutch ships
and Dutch sailors that distributed throughout Europe the
treasures brought by Spanish and Portuguese fleets front the East
and West Indies.</p>
<p>The Netherlands were an appanage of the Spanish Crown. But the
rich manufacturing and trading cities of Flanders and Holland
enjoyed considerable liberties and powers of local
self-government, granted to them from time to time by their
over-lords in exchange for heavy annual payments. It was the
attempt of the Spanish King Philip the Second to abolish the
charters of their towns, to stamp out their liberties, and to
suppress the Reformed Religion by means of the Inquisition, that
led to the rise of the Dutch Republic, and the long and cruel war
with the revolted Provinces, which lasted eighty years
(1566-1648), and finally resulted in the humiliation of
Spain.</p>
<p>The Dutch revolt forms one of the most striking epochs in
history. It was the first blow struck in modern times for human
freedom and liberty of conscience against the despotism of kings
and the intolerance of priests. The power of the strongest empire
in the world was put forth to crush the revolted citizens.
Treachery, torture, and massacre were freely and ruthlessly
employed. The butcheries of the Duke of Alva still stand out
pre-eminent in the bloody annals of tyranny and persecution. The
story, as we read it in the graphic pages of Motley, bristles
with deeds of ferocious cruelty and blood.</p>
<p>The struggle would have been hopeless, but that their
extremity taught the Dutch to find their strength upon the sea.
Powerless before their enemies on land, the patriots took to the
ocean. In small vessels their hardy sailors cut off the Spanish
supplies, made daring descents on sea-coast towns, and, in
process of time, set themselves to work to strike Spain in her
most vulnerable part, her commerce with the New World, from which
she drew her wealth. The Beggars of the Sea, as the Dutch rovers
styled themselves, became the terrors of the richly-laden
galleons and haughty fleets of Spain. Not only did they cut off
the supplies of gold and silver from the New World on which the
Spanish King depended, but in the spoils which they wrested from
the enemy, and in the trade which they were continually
extending, they found the means for their country to carry on the
conflict. England, -almost equally in danger from Spanish
designs, made common cause against the enemy. Even when the
countries were not at open war, Drake and the English seamen
acknowledged no peace with Spain beyond the Line, but captured
her ships and sacked her settlements on the Spanish Main,
returning home laden with treasure. Foiled in his disastrous
attempt to conquer England with his Great Armada, Philip was
equally unsuccessful in his efforts to destroy the Dutch
commerce. In vain did he prohibit the Hollanders from trading
with his dominions. In vain did he, from time to time, lay
embargoes on their ships, and send thousands of her sailors to
languish in the dungeons of the Inquisition. The bold Hollanders
only replied by vigorous reprisals. They mocked at his
prohibitions, and continued to carry on an ever-increasing and
enormously-profitable illicit-trade. Dutch and English privateers
triumphantly swept the seas, and harried the Spaniards at their
pleasure. Subjugated Flanders had become an obedient Spanish
province; her rich merchants had fled, and her people were
starving in a desolated country. But the unconquered United
Provinces of the north were actually profiting by the war, and
every day growing richer and more powerful.</p>
<p>The long struggle on the seas, and its successful issue,
roused, both in England and Holland, an insatiable spirit of
adventure. In England, this spirit found its outlet in
privateering or piratical exploits, such as those of Hawkins and
Drake; or in romantic expeditions, such as that of Raleigh to
Guiana; and led, in its ultimate development, to the
establishment of our Colonial and Indian Empire.</p>
<p>In Holland, the adventurous spirit received a strong stimulus
from the blind and stupid policy of the Spanish King. For a
hundred years&mdash;ever since the discovery of the Cape route to
the East Indies&mdash;Lisbon had been the great centre of the
eastern trade. It was thither the Dutch traders came to bring
wheat, fish, and other products of Northern Europe, and to carry
away, in return, and distribute, the spices and merchandise of
the East. In 1594, Philip&mdash;who had some time before acquired
the crown of Portugal&mdash;closed the port of Lisbon, and
prohibited Dutch and English ships, even under a neutral flag,
from trading with any part of his empire. The blow not only
failed of its effect, but recoiled on the striker. It ruined
Lisbon, crippled Spain, and made the Dutch East Indian Empire.
With a sagacious daring, the Hollanders immediately formed the
steady resolve to find these eastern treasures for themselves,
and wrest the trade from their enemies.</p>
<p>Their first attempt to reach the Indies was discouraging. It
was a favourite idea in those days that a short and practicable
route to China and India could be found by the north-east passage
round the north of Europe. To find this passage, and take the
Portuguese in the rear, was the object of the first Dutch
enterprise. The expedition proved disastrous, getting no further
than Nova Zembla. Two subsequent expeditions in the same
direction met with no better fate.</p>
<p>Baffled in their efforts to find a passage through the frozen
seas of the North, the Dutch turned their attention to the old
route round the Cape. The merchants of Amsterdam formed a
company, under the quaint name of "The Company of Far Lands", and
fitted out four vessels, the largest 400 tons, and the smallest
only 30 tons burden. The little fleet sailed from the Texel, 2nd
April, 1595. After a fifteen months' voyage, it reached Java, and
laid the foundation of the Dutch eastern trade. From this time
new companies were formed in Holland; every year fresh fleets
left for the east, many of them returning with rich cargoes, and
making enormous profits. In spite of the violent attacks of the
Spaniards and Portuguese, the Dutch steadily pushed their way in
the Eastern Archipelago, and made reprisals on their enemies with
telling effect. Their humane and prudent conduct contributed
greatly to their success in establishing trade relations with the
native princes, by whom the Portuguese were detested for their
cruelty, arrogance, and overbearing behaviour.</p>
<p>The English had now entered into competition with the Dutch in
the India trade, and, in 1600, the first English East India
Company was founded. But the English company found their rivals
too powerful. In 1602, the various companies in Holland agreed to
cease their mutual competition, and unite. This was the beginning
of the famous Dutch East India Company, which, on 20th March,
1602, received from the States-General a charter for twenty-one
years, giving it an exclusive monopoly of the trade with the
East. The company had a capital of six and a half millions of
florins, or &pound;550,000, more than eight times that of its
English rival. It was managed by a body of seventeen directors,
known as the Council of Seventeen.</p>
<p>The Dutch had already (1602) established themselves
permanently in Java. Here they founded the city of Batavia, which
became the centre of their trade, and the residence of the
Governor-General of their Eastern possessions. They established
factories in Malabar, drove the Spaniards from Amboyna, and took
possession of the island, wrested Malacca from the Portuguese,
and expelled the same nation from the Moluccas, or Spice Islands.
In 1621, less than twenty years after its foundation, the Company
had a practical monopoly of the trade in cloves, nutmegs,
cinnamon, and other products of the Archipelago. The Portuguese
had been driven out, and England only waged an obstinate but
unsuccessful rivalry. In 1638, the Dutch supplanted the
Portuguese in Japan, and, in 1656, got possession of the island
of Ceylon.</p>
<p>In a work by Sir Walter Raleigh, entitled, "Observations
touching Trade and Commerce with the Hollanders and other
Nations", presented to King James in the year 1603, we find a
striking picture of the commerce of the Netherlands as compared
with that of England.</p>
<p>Raleigh attributes the sudden and astonishing rise of the
Netherlander, among other causes, to the "embargoing and
confiscating of their ships in Spain, which constrained them, and
gave them courage to trade by force into the East and West
Indies, and in Africa, where they employ 180 ships and 8700
mariners." (This, it should be noted, was only seven years after
the first Dutch vessel had reached Java.) Sir Walter gives a
number of interesting particulars respecting the extent of Dutch
trade. He says, "We send into the Eastern kingdoms [of Europe]
yearly but 100 ships; the Low Countries 3000. They send into
France, Portugal, and Italy, from the Eastern kingdoms, through
the Sound and our narrow seas, 2000 ships; we, none. They trade
with 500 or 600 ships into our country; we, with 40 ships to
three of their towns. They have as many ships as eleven kingdoms
of Christendom, let England be one. They build yearly 1000 ships,
having not one timber tree growing in their own country, nor
home-bred commodities to lade 100 ships, yet they have 20,000
ships and vessels, and all employed." In shipbuilding and
seamanship, also, the Dutch sailors in those days were the
superiors of the English, for Sir Walter says that, while an
English ship of a hundred tons required a crew of thirty men, the
Hollanders would sail a ship of the same size with ten men.</p>
<p>We are accustomed to dwell on the naval exploits of Drake,
Hawkins, and Frobisher, on the enterprise of the Elizabethan
sailors and merchant-adventurers, and on the marvellous success
of our own great East India Company. We have good reason to feel
pride in the deeds of the gallant English seamen of those days,
and in the trade which, in later times, has carried the English
flag into every sea. But we are apt to forget how comparatively
recent is the predominant position of England in commerce and in
naval power. In the 17th century, it was the Dutch who were the
sailors, and the merchants of the world, and the masters of the
sea. Not London, but Amsterdam, was the great emporium for the
products of East and West, the centre of the world's trade, and
the richest city on the globe. The commerce of Europe and of the
world was in the hands of the merchants of the Low Countries, who
had a hundred ships afloat for every one owned by Englishmen.</p>

<h4>I. YOUTH AND EARLY VOYAGES, 1603-1638.</h4>
<p>It was in the midst of the Eighty Years' War, in the year
after the foundation of the Company in whose service he was to
win his fame, and in the same year that Sir Walter Raleigh
presented to King James his memorial on the trade of the
Hollanders, that Abel Janszoon Tasman stepped on to this world's
stage. He was born in the little inland village of Luytjegast, in
the province of Groningen, in the year 1603. Groningen is the
most north-easterly province of Holland, and formed part of the
ancient Friesland. It is flat, even for proverbially flat
Holland. The highest hill, the Doeseberg, rises to a height of
only 35 feet above the level of the ocean, and some of the
country lies even below the sea-level. It is protected from the
furious inroads of the North Sea by magnificent dykes of timber
and stone. Behind these massive ramparts stretch wide and fertile
fields and meadows, rich in agricultural and dairy produce. The
cultivators, who hold their lands under a species of
tenant-right, are at present the richest and most prosperous
peasant farmers in the whole of Europe. In Roman times the
Frisians occupied the country from the Elbe to the Rhine,
including the extensive tract now covered by the Zuyder Zee, over
which the sea burst so late as the thirteenth century. They were
sea rovers as well as cattle herdsmen, and were distinguished for
their fierce independence and indomitable love of liberty. They
were one of the tribes that took part in the conquest of Britain.
At this day the Frisian language, spoken by a handful of people,
is the most nearly related of all Low German dialects to the
English, and the men are nearest to the English in blood. The
Frieslanders are of a different race from the inhabitants of
Holland proper. The typical Dutchman is squat and short-legged;
the Frieslander, tall, yellow-haired, blue-eyed, and of powerful
build. We may fairly believe that Tasman belonged to this tall,
bold, and impetuous race, who supplied no small portion of the
hardy fishermen and sailors whose daring made Holland a great
sea-power.</p>
<p>We have no information as to the Tasman family, but it is to
be presumed that its social status was a humble one. How Abel
came by the surname which is now world-renowned is a matter of
dispute. In the Luytjegast district family names were unknown
until the beginning of this century. The son added to his own
Christian name the Christian name of his father; thus, Abel, the
son of John, became Abel Janszoon, and by this name simply Tasman
is often designated in the old records. A nickname was often
acquired, derived from some personal peculiarity, from a trade, a
sign, or a ship. It has been conjectured that either Abel Jansz
or his father took the name Tasman or Taschman from a boat or
vessel named the <i>Tasch</i> (bag or net), belonging to the
family.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* In the Archives of Hoorn there is a document
relating to a ship called the <i>Tasch</i>, of which the skipper
was Cornelis Gerritszoon Taschman.]</p>
<p>Of young Abel's early life in the flat polders or meadows of
Luyjegast there is no record. The boy would see little or nothing
of the horrors of the war which, for forty years, had been
desolating a great part of the Low Countries. The most desperate
part of the struggle was over with the death of Alexander of
Parma. The gloomy bigot and tyrant, Philip the Second, was dead.
Flanders had fallen, and had become an obedient and desolate
Spanish province, under the rule of the Archduke Albert and his
wife, Isabella of Spain; but the United Provinces, under Prince
Maurice of Nassau, son of William the Silent, were not only
holding their own against the Spaniards, but were daily growing
in prosperity and power. When young Abel was six years old, they
had succeeded in wringing from their exhausted, enemy a twelve
years' truce, with the acknowledgment of the Republic, and of its
right to carry on the India trade. The boy's imagination must
have been often stirred by tales of the daring deeds of the
Beggars of the Sea, and the heroic resistance of Hollanders and
Zeelanders to the mighty power of Spain. Not less must his spirit
of adventure have been stimulated by the stories that drifted to
his quiet village, telling of the riches of India, of the Spice
Islands, and of far Cathay. Small wonder that the old sea-roving
Frisian blood asserted itself, and that Abel Jansz, like the
majority of Hollanders in that age, found his vocation as a
sailor. That he had managed to acquire some education is evident
from the fact that he had at least learned to write, a somewhat
rare accomplishment in those days for persons in his humble
station.</p>
<p>It is not unlikely that in the fisheries of the North Sea,
that nursery of daring sailors, he served his first
apprenticeship to the ocean. But the adventurous spirit was
strong within him, and it was natural that he should soon find
his way to Amsterdam, the centre of the commerce of the world,
eager to seek his fortune in the rich eastern lands which his
countrymen had won. He had married young&mdash;either in his
native province or in Amsterdam&mdash;and his wife, Claesjie
Heyndricks, had died, leaving him an only daughter. When we get
the first definite information respecting him he was a widower,
living in the Terketelsteeg (Tarkettle Lane), one of the poorest
quarters of Amsterdam. Here, on the 27th December, 1631, he
married his second wife, Jannetjie Tjaers.** He was not
encumbered with property,&mdash;at least, his name does not
appear in the contemporary register of assessment for the half
per cent. tax. His wife was not greatly his superior in social
position, and could not sign the marriage register. She belonged
to a working-class family,&mdash;her father being a powder-maker,
and her brother a sailor, like her husband. The family were not,
however, altogether without means. They were owners of one, if
not two, small houses in Amsterdam. The young couple began life
in a more respectable locality than Tarkettle Lane, setting up
house in the Palm-street. It cannot have been long after his
marriage that Abel Jansz, then 28 or 29 years old, made what was
probably his first voyage to the East Indies, in the service of
the Dutch East India Company. That shortly after this time he was
in the service of the Company in the Eastern Seas we know from
independent evidence. Mr. Heeres has found in the old Colonial
archives two declarations, signed by Tasman in 1634, which inform
us of his rapid rise, during the space of two years at most, from
the position of a simple sailor to that of master of a ship. In
May, he was mate of the ship <i>Weesp</i> (<i>Wasp</i>), trading
from Batavia, in Java, to Amboyna, in the Moluccas. In July, the
Governor of Amboyna appointed him master&mdash;"skipper" was the
term in those days&mdash;of the jacht *** <i>Mocha</i>.</p>

<p>Tasman was, therefore, employed in the spice trade, the chief
centre of which was the Moluccas, or Spice Islands, and
especially Amboyna and the Banda Isles, the native home of the
nutmeg and the clove. In these days it is difficult for us to
understand the value which our forefathers, even down to the end
of the 17th century, set upon eastern spices&mdash;pepper,
cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and especially cloves. It has been
remarked that, at banquets in England, in the Middle Ages, a
place next to the spice-box was more coveted than the proverbial
place above the salt. This may, probably, be explained by the
fact of the little variety of food possible during the Middle
Ages, when (in the winter especially) all classes had to live
mostly on salt provisions&mdash;especially salt fish&mdash;and
had hardly any fresh vegetables, until the Dutch taught Europe
how to grow them, Before the discovery of the route round the
Cape, a pound of spice was often worth as much as a quarter of
wheat. After Da Gama's voyage the trade remained for a century in
the hands of the Portuguese, and the monopoly yielded them
enormous profit, sometimes as much as fifty-fold. The hope of
getting possession of this coveted trade was the chief incentive
to Dutch efforts to reach the Indies. Pepper, ginger, and
cinnamon were too widely grown to enable them to command a
monopoly, and in these articles the English East India Company
was able, with more or less success, to divide the trade with the
Dutch. It was otherwise with the more valued spices, such as
nutmeg and cloves. These were limited to a few of the East India
Islands. Cloves, in particular, grew nowhere but on two or three
islands of the Moluccas. To secure the monopoly of these, the
Dutch, accordingly, bent all their energies. In 1605, they
succeeded in driving the Portuguese out of Amboyna, and obtaining
the mastery of the whole of the Moluccas. The English East India
Company kept Tip an obstinate rivalry, but the Dutch met them
with determined hostility. They attacked the English factories on
small pretext, captured their vessels, and, after the massacre of
a number of English traders at Amboyna, in 1623, finally excluded
their rivals from all share in the trade. This contest for the
spice trade was the origin and chief cause of the long and bitter
enmity between the two nations. To such lengths did the Dutch go
that, some years later, they ruthlessly rooted up the clove
plantations on all the islands of the Moluccas, except Amboyna
and Band a. Here, alone, did they allow the clove to be produced,
in order that they might enhance the price, and make certain of
preserving their monopoly.</p>
<p>But to return to Tasman. It is evident that his singular
capacity had soon made itself evident to the colonial
authorities, for, in August, 1635, we find the simple sailor of
three years before, now as "Commandeur Abel", cruising at the
head of a fleet of small vessels (<i>kiels</i>), to protect the
jealously-guarded monopoly from foreign intrusion, and,
generally, to harass the ships of hostile European rivals in the
waters of Amboyna and the Banda Sea. In September, 1636, he was
on his way back to Batavia, the centre of Dutch rule, and the
residence of the Governor-General of the Indies. On his arrival,
he found himself involved in difficulties with his crew. They
cited him before the Chief Magistrate's Court, complaining that,
while cruising in the Banda Sea, he had, presumably in the
interests of his own pocket, stinted them of their necessary
allowance of rations. As he was acquitted by the Court, which was
sufficiently experienced in such matters, we may conclude that he
was unjustly accused; at least, we may give him the benefit of
the doubt.</p>
<p>He was now bent on revisiting the Home country, and to
acomplish this he was ready to accept, for the time, a
subordinate post, and, accordingly, shipped as mate on board the
<i>Banda</i>. The <i>Banda</i> was the flagship of a
homeward-bound fleet (<i>retour vloot</i>) of several sail. Her
skipper was Matthys Quast, a bold and capable sailor, of whom we
shall hear more presently. When on the point of sailing, on 30th
December, 1636, the officers and crew, 111 in number, were
required to make a declaration, which is interesting as
illustrative of the troubled state of the times, of the dangers
of war, and the prevalence of privateering. It also shows the
survival of the ancient usage&mdash;a part of the old maritime
law of the 13th century, the Roles d'Ol&eacute;ron&mdash;which
gave to the ship's Council, and even to the common sailors, a
voice in the control of the voyage. By this declaration&mdash;to
which the whole 111 set their signatures or marks&mdash;the
Governor, skipper, merchant, mates, officers, soldiers, and
seamen, presently appointed and sailing on the ship <i>Banda</i>,
solemnly promised that, in view of the Spanish men-of-war and the
privateers of Dunkirk, they would in no wise pass through the
English Channel, but would hold their course round England,
Ireland, and Scotland, so that they might in safety make the
harbours of the Fatherland.</p>
<p>The <i>Banda</i> arrived at the Texel on 1st August, 1637,
after a seven months' voyage. Tasman remained at Amsterdam for
some months with his wife Jannetie, who had recovered from an
illness so serious that she had made her will. This will is still
in existence. It was drawn up on 18th December, 1636, by the
Notary, Pieter Barcman. It recites that the worthy Jannetje
Tjercks, wife of Abel Jansz Tasman, citizen, was then lying ill
in bed, but was of good memory and understanding. Her residence
was at the corner of the Palmcross-street, on the Braeck. Should
the testatrix die without issue, then, after certain bequests to
the poor, she constituted her sister, Geertje Tjercks, her sole
legatee. There is no mention of her husband or of the little
step-daughter, Claesjen. We need not, therefore, assume that
there had been any quarrel between the married pair. The absence
of Abel in the Indies, from which return was so uncertain, may
explain why the wife should leave her property to relations on
the spot.</p>
<p>Meantime, Abel and his brothers-in-law appeared before the
Amsterdam magistrates, with the object of selling the family
house in the Palm-street for 500 florins. For some reason, the
contract was cancelled, and the family retained the house until
1650, when Powels Barentsz, in his own name, and as attorney for
his brother-in-law Tasman, who was then in the Indies, conveyed
the property to Andries Barents.</p>
<p>After a stay of some nine months in Amsterdam, Abel Jansz once
more set his face eastward. He entered into a new ten years'
engagement with the Company, and, in consideration of this, he
was allowed to take his wife with him&mdash;the Council of
Seventeen having just passed a new regulation whereby the chief
officers were permitted to take their wives to the East Indies,
provided they were lawfully wedded, were of good lives, and could
show good credentials. Tasman was put in command of the fly-ship
* <i>Engel</i> (<i>Angel</i>), fitted out by the Amsterdam
Chamber. The <i>Engel</i> sailed from the Texel, 15th April,
1638, and arrived at Batavia on 11th October following. The
skipper's pay was 60 guilders (&pound;5) per month. On arrival at
Batavia, he was continued in his post for three -years, at an
increased pay of 80 guilders (&pound;6 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.)
per month.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Fly-ships (<i>fluit</i>) were long
quick-sailing ships, of light draught, varying from 200 to 400

<h4>II. VOYAGES IN JAPAN SEAS, &amp;c., 1639-1642.</h4>
<p>It is in the year following his return to Batavia, some six
years after his first voyage thither, that we find Abel Jansz
first chosen to take a prominent part in a discovery
expedition.</p>
<p>The enterprise of the early Dutch governors in their efforts
to open up new trade for their Company was ceaseless. Jan
Pieterszoon Coen, Governor-General between 1618 and 1629, was the
most illustrious, and the one who did most to consolidate the
Dutch power. He it was who built the fort at Batavia, and fixed
the centre of government there. He it was who, in Java, baffled
the English, and overmastered them in the Moluccas. During his
rule, Dutch ships first made the coast of Australia. After Coen,
the most famous governor&mdash;he who showed the greatest energy
in his persistent search for new lands and new markets&mdash;was
Antony van Diemen, the Governor-General who was in power when
Tasman returned to the Indies, and with whom his fame will be for
ever associated.</p>
<p>Early in the career of the Dutch Company in the Eastern
Archipelago, the Directors had cast longing eyes towards the
powerful kingdom of the Great Khan&mdash;the Cathay whose wonders
had been first revealed to Europe by the traveller Marco Polo, in
the 13th century. Not many years after Da Gama's discovery of the
Cape route (1516), the Portuguese had penetrated to Canton, and
by the middle of the 16th century (1542) had established
relations with Japan, where, for a time, they exerted a great
influence, and carried on a lucrative trade. When the Dutch
reached the East, they were not slow to follow in the footsteps
of their rivals. Seven years after the foundation of the Company,
they sent ships to Japan, and continued to trade there every
year, in spite of the violent opposition of the Portuguese.
Finally, they were allowed to set up a factory on Firando, an
island to the west of Kiusiu, and this soon became one of the
most profitable stations of the Company's trade.</p>
<p>In 1635, a certain William Verstegen, residing at Firando,
sent a letter to Batavia, stating that the Japanese reported
that, many miles to the eastward, in latitude 37&frac12;&deg;
North, there was "a very great country or island, rich without
measure in gold and silver, and inhabited by civilised and
friendly people." This was just the sort of report to excite the
imaginations of those early traders, who were constantly
tantalised by dreams of a new Mexico or Peru to be discovered in
the Pacific. It was known that, in 1620, the Spaniards had
searched in vain for this golden island; but, undeterred by the
former failure, Governor-General Van Diemen and his Council
resolved to fit out an expedition to make the discovery. The
scheme, through various domestic troubles, lay in abeyance for
some years, but, in 1639, two ships were fitted out for the
adventure. Tasman's ship, the <i>Engel</i>, was one of the
vessels chosen. The other was named the <i>Gracht</i>
(<i>Canal</i>), and was under the command of an experienced
sailor and pilot, Matthys Hendrikszoon Quast, under whom Abel had
sailed as mate in the <i>Banda</i> on the homeward voyage three
years before. Quast was chief and Tasman second in command.
Tasman was now about 35 years old; he had been but six years in
the Company's service, and had not only risen from the grade of a
simple sailor to that of captain of a ship, but was now entrusted
with the second place in a difficult and important enterprise.
His rapid promotion proves that Quast and the Colonial
authorities had recognised in him high qualities as a seaman and
a leader of men. The ships sailed from Batavia on 2nd June, and
made their way round the north of the Philippine Islands, keeping
a north-easterly course, until, on 20th July, they sighted some
islands belonging to a group now known as the Bonin Archipelago.
Thence they steered north-east, and then back to the Japan coast,
searching for the land of gold. From this point they pushed out
again into the great ocean further than any one before them, to a
distance of some 2000 miles east from Japan. For two months
longer they cruised backwards and forwards in those far northern
seas, between 37&frac12;&deg; and 46&deg; north latitude,
straining their eyes in vain for some indication of the golden
island. They were in a wretched condition. Many of the crew had
died, and the number of sick increased daily. The remnant were
worn out with the hardships of the voyage, and barely able to do
the incessant pumping necessary to keep their leaky vessels
afloat. Their provisions were running short, and there was still
no faintest sign of land. Disappointed and dejected, the
commanders and ships' council reluctantly resolved to give up a
fruitless search. On the 25th October, they turned their ships
for Formosa, to obtain refreshment for the sick, and to refit.
Taking the coast of Japan on their way, they came to an anchor on
the 24th November, before Fort Zealandia, on the island of
Tayouwan or Formosa, then a Dutch possession. They had been
nearly six months at sea, and out of a crew of ninety, had lost
nearly forty men. No further search was ever made for the
wonderful island.</p>
<p>In the following year, Tasman made another voyage to Japan,
this time for the purposes of trade, as skipper of the fly-ship
<i>Oostkappel</i> (<i>Eastchapel</i>). The fleet with which he
sailed consisted of eleven ships, carrying freight valued at
&pound;525,000; the <i>Oostkappel</i>'s cargo, alone, was worth
&pound;80,000. This gives us an idea of the value of the Japan
trade. The Hollanders were now the only Europeans allowed to
trade with the country. The Portuguese had, for nearly a century,
carried on a most profitable trade, but their arrogance and
intrigues, and, above all, the proselytising zeal of the Jesuit
missionaries&mdash;who had made many thousand converts, and
acquired an enormous influence&mdash;excited the jealousy and
hostility of the Government. Christianity was suppressed.
Foreigners were excluded from the Empire, and only allowed to
trade with Firando and Nagasaki. In 1639, an insurrection led to
a general massacre of the Christians, and the absolute expulsion
of the Portuguese, under pain of death.</p>
<p>The <i>Oostkappel</i> arrived at Firando on 25th August, 1640,
and lay there for some three months. During her stay the Dutch
got into serious trouble with the Japanese Government, and were
compelled to demolish their factory, which was too much like a
fort to satisfy the susceptibilities of the Imperial Government.
Mr. Lauts has given us the resolutions of the Council of the
Dutch Factory at Firando, in 1640. When the Imperial rescript
arrived, Tasman, in virtue of his commission as captain of the
<i>Oostkappel</i>, sat as a member of the Council, and signed its
resolutions. The situation was most perilous, but Francis Caron,
the president of the Council, returned the prudent answer: "All
that His Imperial Majesty is pleased to command, we will
punctually obey." Still, the Dutch were slow in proceeding with
the work of demolition, and it was not until another Imperial
rescript arrived, threatening to put the members of the Council
to death if the order was not instantly obeyed, that the great
stone factory&mdash;which had cost the Dutch 100,000 guilders to
build&mdash;was finally levelled to the ground. They were
compelled to submit to the most vexatious restrictions, and to
put up with countless humiliations, in order to maintain their
position. But the trade was too valuable to be lightly
relinquished, and by their submission the Dutch alone, of
European nations, for more than 200 years, managed to retain
trade relations with Japan, though living, as the Japanese said,
"like frogs in a well", until, in 1853, the American squadron,
under Commodore Perry, broke in upon Japanese isolation, and
paved the way for that remarkable revolution, the latest
development of which we have seen in the recent war between Japan
and China.</p>
<p>In May, 1641, Tasman sailed from Batavia to take in a cargo at
Lauwek, the capital of Cambodia, and then to proceed to Japan.
The Cambodian Kingdom, at that time, extended over a great
portion of south-eastern Further India, now Cochin China. Its
capital, Lauwek, on the great river Cambodia, was, one of the
most important cities of the east; it was the centre of a great
trade in furs, ivory, silk stuffs, and other merchandise, which
were brought from the interior and from China, and exported to
Japan and other places. The Dutch, as the price of assistance
given to the King in some of his wars, had, a few years
previously, obtained leave to set up a factory at Lauwek, which
was of great value to them in the Japan trade. For this factory
Tasman sailed in his ship the <i>Oostkappel</i>, and, in July,
came to an anchor in the Lauwek Roads. On his arrival, he found
the Dutch and Portuguese in violent conflict. A few days before a
dispute had arisen between the crew of the Dutch fly-ship
<i>Zaijer</i> and the Portuguese, and this, through the
overbearing arrogance of the latter, had grown into a fight, and
had cost some of the Dutch their lives. The Directors of the
factory had appealed to the King to punish the offenders, but the
Portuguese, having won him over by bribes, were only sentenced to
pay a fine. This blood-money the Dutch refused with contempt,
and, since neither by entreaty nor in any other way could they
obtain a juster sentence, they resolved to exact satisfaction
themselves. At this critical juncture Tasman made his appearance
at Louwek, and, as he lacked neither the courage nor the
inclination to avenge the murder of his countrymen, he soon found
an opportunity of inflicting an exemplary punishment on the
enemy.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Voormeulen van Boekeren, p. 33.]</p>
<p>Since their expulsion from Japan, the Portuguese had contrived
to keep a share of the trade by importing their wares under the
Cambodian flag. On the <i>Oostkappel</i>'s arrival, a rich cargo
of silks from Macao (the Portuguese settlement at the mouth of
the Canton River) was being transhipped into two junks flying the
Cambodian flag, in order to be sent to Japan. Tasman had express
instructions to attack and make prizes of all Spanish,
Portuguese, and other foreign ships not provided with free passes
from the Dutch Company, giving them permission to trade. He,
therefore, rapidly discharged his cargo, loaded for Formosa, and
then weighed anchor, and cruised outside the river to look out
for the Portuguese junks. A few days after leaving the river, the
junks hove in sight, and Tasman gave chase. He soon overhauled
one of them, and, after a sharp fight, the junk surrendered, and
her silks, worth 5500 dollars, were transferred to the
<i>Oostkappel</i>. The other junk (with a cargo worth 5000
dollars), aided by the gathering darkness, succeeded in escaping,
and Tasman, abandoning further pursuit, proceeded with his spoil
to Formosa. His conduct in this matter did not, however, meet
with the approval of the authorities at Batavia, and Abel, for
his alleged negligence in not capturing the second junk, was
condemned to forfeit two months' wages. On leaving Formosa, the
<i>Oostkappel</i> was overtaken by a violent storm. She lost her
mainmast, and was so disabled that the ship's council judged it
impossible to proceed with the voyage to Japan. The ship,
therefore, made for Formosa, and, after a most perilous voyage,
contrived to reach Fort Zealandia. Here the cargo for Japan was
transhipped to the <i>Zaijer</i>, and the <i>Oostkappel</i> was
sufficiently repaired to be able to sail, under jury rig, with a
cargo of silks for Batavia, where she arrived on 20th
December.</p>
<p>Although Tasman, as we have said, was fined two months' wages
for dereliction of duty in allowing the Portuguese junk to escape
him, it would appear that this was but a necessary part of the
rigid discipline of the Company, and involved no real disgrace.
His voyage with Quast, in search of the "golden island", had
tested his qualities of hardihood and endurance; his voyages to
Japan had proved his skill and resource in seamanship; his
services in the Banda Sea, and his smart action at Lauwek (in
spite of nominal blame), had shown his courage and capacity, and
his zeal and determination as a stout upholder of the rights and
privileges&mdash;not to say of the arrogant assumptions&mdash;of
the Company. Van Diemen, ever on the watch for capable and
resolute men who could further his plans for the extension of the
Dutch supremacy in the East, had recognised Abel's great
qualities. This is plain from the important enterprises with
which he was constantly entrusted. So little did his failure to
capture the junk affect his standing, that, within three or four
months after the infliction of the fine the Governor-General
offered him the conduct of an important mission, in which not
only his resolution, but his diplomatic skill would be put to
proof. Amongst other countries in which the Dutch had early
established themselves was the great island of Sumatra. They had
soon elbowed out the Portuguese, and now had factories at Acheen,
Djambi, and other places. The most important of these was at
Palembang (not far from the coasts of Java). This post commanded
the pepper trade of the south of the island. The powerful Sultan
of Palembang had long been on most friendly terms with the Dutch,
but, through the machinations of a Chinese, named Bencki, who had
fled from Batavia in debt to the Company, and had managed to
ingratiate himself with the Sultan, these relations were
seriously imperilled. The differences and misunderstandings which
had arisen now threatened to end in war. It was with the view of
bringing the Sultan to a better mind that Tasman was despatched
to Palembang with a fleet of four vessels. He left Batavia on
23rd April, 1642, And, two or three days later, the little
squadron cast anchor in the mouth of the river on which the
Sultan's capital was situated. Here, by way of preliminary, Abel
Jansz took possession of some junks loaded with pepper, and,
having transferred their cargoes to his own vessels, he sailed up
the river to Palembang. His instructions were to do his best to
arrange matters by friendly means before having recourse to
hostile measures. He, therefore, sought an interview with the
Sultan. To the surprise of the Dutch, the audience was not only
granted, but the ambassador met with a most friendly reception.
Abel showed himself a skilful diplomatist. He disabused the
Sultan's mind of the prejudices instilled by the Chinaman, and
dwelt on the good disposition of the government at Batavia. He
showed the importance, not only to the Company, but also to the
kingdom of Palembang, of the maintenance of the trade and of the
amicable relations hitherto existing. Finally, he urged, in
forcible terms, the mischief that would ensue from a war between
the two hitherto friendly powers. It is, perhaps, doubtful
whether the diplomatist's words would have been as convincing if
they had not been supported by the tangible argument of a
squadron of ships, commanded by a man who, clearly, was not to be
trifled with. But, however that may be, the Sultan was completely
won over, and, without further hesitation, renewed the treaty of
friendship. Tasman's mission being thus successfully completed,
he returned with his fleet to Batavia, carrying with him the
obnoxious Chinaman, and was received by Van Diemen and his
Council with the warmest acknowledgments for his services in
having extricated them from what had at one time threatened to be
a very serious trouble.</p>

<h4>III. THE GREAT DISCOVERY VOYAGES TO THE SOUTHLAND,
1642-1644.</h4>
<p align="center">1. <i>The Unknown Southland</i>.</p>
<p>Tasman was now in his fortieth year. In ten years' wanderings
and fightings in the service of the Company he had grown inured
to hardships and danger. He was familiar with the great trade
routes from Europe to India, with the intricacies of the waters
of the Eastern Archipelago, and with the navigation of the Seas
of China and Japan. He had sailed a thousand miles beyond the
limits reached by any previous navigator into the unknown and
mysterious regions of the cold and stormy North Pacific Ocean. In
his many voyages he had proved himself a keen trader, a capable
and daring seaman, a bold fighter, and an able commander. He was
now ready to undertake the great adventure, the crowning
achievement of his adventurous life&mdash;that voyage to the
Great Southland, which, as a Dutch historian says, "must
specially immortalise him; the expedition which must ever give
him an honourable place amongst the greatest navigators and
discoverers."</p>
<p>The Great Unknown Southern Continent&mdash;Terra Australia
Incognita, or Nondum Cognita&mdash;had for ages been the dream of
geographers. The ancient cosmographers had formulated a theory as
to the existence of a huge continent in the south, which they
considered necessary to balance the large continents in the
Northern Hemisphere. The discovery of North and South America
only lent fresh weight to this conjecture, and it was commonly
supposed in the 16th and 17th centuries&mdash;and indeed was
almost an article of faith&mdash;that below the Equator there was
a huge continent which had still to be discovered and
explored.</p>
<p>It was in 1513 that the Spaniard Vasco Nunez de Balboa first
saw the Pacific from a mountain in Panama. Ferdinand Magellan was
the first to enter it. Leaving Spain, in 1519, with five small
ships of from 130 to 60 tons, this heroic navigator felt his way
through the Strait which bears his name, and, crossing the great
ocean, after months of suffering, reached the Ladrones. He
himself was killed at the Philippines, but one of his ships, the
Victoria, with a handful of men, returned to Spain, after a
voyage lasting three years, having been the first to
circumnavigate the globe. Magellan's voyage was prompted by the
desire of Spain to find a way to the Moluccas on the west, with
the object of disputing the claims of Portugal, and wresting from
her the spice trade. With a similar object, the Spanish Viceroys
of Mexico and Peru despatched various expeditions to the
Moluccas. In one of these voyages, in 1528, Saavedra, sent out by
Cortez, sighted New Guinea, which had previously been seen by the
Portuguese. In 1564, the Philippines were colonised by the
Spaniards. In another voyage, in 1568, Mendana discovered the
Solomons, and brought to Peru such a glowing account of their
wealth that, in 1595, he was despatched with a fleet to found a
settlement there. He failed, however, to find the islands, and
unsuccessfully attempted to plant a colony on Santa Cruz.
Fernandez de Quiros, his pilot on this voyage, was firmly
persuaded that here, at last, was the great Terra Australis. He
petitioned the King of Spain to be allowed to colonise it, and in
his memorial "it is soberly affirmed to be a terrestrial paradise
for wealth and pleasures." He declares that the country abounds
in fruits and animals, in silver and pearls, probably, also, in
gold, and is nothing inferior to Guinea in the land of Negroes.
In 1605, Quiros set out from Peru with a powerful fleet to settle
a plantation in the southern paradise. On a large island which he
discovered, and which he took to be a part of the Southern
Continent, and named Australia del Espiritu Santo&mdash;it is, in
fact, one of the New Hebrides&mdash;he founded the short-lived
and unfortunate town of New Jerusalem. One of his companions,
Luis Paz de Torres, separated from the fleet and steered
westward, sailing through the strait which now bears his name,
and skirting the south coast of New Guinea. The first Englishman
to enter the Pacific was Sir Francis Drake. In his "Famous
Voyage", in 1577, he stole through Magellan Strait, fell upon and
plundered the Spanish settlements in Peru, and, following in
Magellan's track across the South Sea, made the Moluccas, and
returned to England laden with booty. In the latter part of the
16th and early part of the 17th centuries several Dutch
navigators accomplished similar circumnavigations. All these
expeditions crossed the Pacific near the equator, and though they
discovered islands, they threw no light on the problem of the
Terra Australis. More important was the voyage of the Dutch
navigators Le Maire and Schouten, in 1616. They found a new
passage into the South Sea, between Tierra del Fuego and
Statenland. Sailing through this Strait of Le Maire, they reached
the open ocean, doubled Cape Horn, and crossed the Pacific in a
higher latitude than Magellan and Drake. Being so far to the
south as 17&deg; S. lat., they confidently expected to fall in
with the great Southland, but were constantly disappointed,
finding nothing but a few islands. Le Maire's ships, on reaching
Batavia after their long voyage, were seized and confiscated by
his countryman, Governor-General Coen, for having come into the
Indies in violation of the charter of monopoly of the Dutch East
India Company. This damped the ardour of explorers for many
years, so much so that for nearly a century no Dutch navigator
ventured again to attempt the circumnavigation of the globe.</p>
<p>These various expeditions had somewhat circumscribed the
possible area within which the Southland might be found. Still,
the old cartographers found the idea of a sea full of islands so
little in harmony with their prepossessions, that, in the early
part of the 17th century (even so late as 1640), they boldly drew
on their maps of the world a huge "Terra Australis Nondum
Cognita." This was depicted as surrounding the South Pole, and
occupying a very considerable portion of the Southern Hemisphere.
In the South Atlantic, the Promontorium Terra Australia jutted
northwards towards Africa. On the west, only the narrow Straits
of Magellan and Le Maire broke its continuity with South America,
and gave the sole means of passage into the South Sea. On the
eastern side, this continent of the map-makers blocked all access
to the Pacific. It extended in a solid but gradually narrowing
mass from the Pole up to the very Equator. In this respect, the
maps were a jumble compounded of discoveries, actually made but
imperfectly known, fitted on to a baseless theory. It is pretty
certain that Portuguese ships sailing from the Eastern
Archipelago had, somewhere between 1512 and 1542, seen the
north-west coast of Australia, and that these discoveries were
vaguely indicated on some of the early charts. They appeared on
the cartographers' maps as the land of Beach, exceedingly rich in
gold. New Guinea had been sighted by the Portuguese Maneses in
1511, and again by the Spaniard Saavedra in 1528; therefore, Nova
Guinea appeared as the most northerly extension of the continent
under the Equator&mdash;sometimes as an island separated by a
narrow strait, sometimes as an integral part of the continent
itself. Beyond New Guinea it is probable that the reported
discovery by the Portuguese of certain vague and
imperfectly-known lands, forming part of the coast of Australia,
justified the delineation of the north-eastern shores of the
continent. But, from the point where information failed,
imagination stepped in, boldly carrying the coastline from
Queensland down in a south-easterly direction to Magellan's
Strait and Cape Horn, and filling the South Pacific with an
imaginary continent.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The prepossession in favour of a Southern
Continent was inveterate in the 17th and 18th centuries. When
Tasman made the west coast of New Zealand lie was confident that
at last he had discovered the west side of the long-sought Terra
Australis Incognita. So late as 1771, Alexander
Dalrymple&mdash;the Hydrographer to the Admiralty, and the
jealous rival of Cook&mdash;published a collection of voyages to
the South Sea with the express object of demonstrating the
existence of a huge Southern Continent. The only part of the
Pacific then unexplored was that lying between New Zealand and
Magellan Strait. This gave nearly the area which, by elaborate
calculation, Dalrymple showed was necessary to preserve the
equilibrium of land between the northern and southern
hemispheres. He therefore concluded that this space south of the
Equator must be almost entirely solid land. Within four years of
the publication of Dalrymple's work, Cook, in his second voyage,
by sailing over the site of the imaginary continent, finally
dissipated the fable, and reduced the Terra Australis Incognita
to the frozen mass within the Antarctic circle.]</p>
<p>When the Dutch had established themselves in the Eastern
Archipelago, their spirit of enterprise and adventure, and their
ambition to win new realms for the Company's trade, were only
stimulated by their unprecedented success. It became an object of
ardent desire to the Home Directors, the Council of Seventeen,
and to the successive Governors-General of the Indies, to explore
the mystery of the Great South Land; if, perchance, they might
there find a second Mexico or Peru, rich in gold and silver, or
new spice islands, to increase the profits of their trade; or, at
the least, to discover a direct way from their eastern
possessions, by the Great South Sea, to Peru and Chili, which
would make it easy for them to harass and plunder the Spanish
ships and the settlements of South America. It was in
1605&mdash;only three years after the foundation of the
Company&mdash;that the first attempt was made; and the object of
this expedition was limited to the exploration of the regions
lying to the east of the Banda Islands. With this view, the
<i>Duyfke</i> (<i>Little Dove</i> or <i>Darling</i>) sailed from
Batavia, in 1605, visited the Island of Aru, sailed along the
south coast of New Guinea, and reached Cape Keer Weer, in 13&deg;
S. lat., on the east side of the Gulf of Carpentaria&mdash;her
captain thinking, however that he was still on the west coast of
New Guinea.</p>
<p>For a number of years the want of suitable vessels which could
be spared from the needs of the East India settlements, and the
hostilities in which they were constantly involved with their
European rivals in the spice trade, coupled with the necessity of
consolidating their power in the Eastern Archipelago, prevented
the Colonial authorities from engaging in distant adventures. The
first Dutch discoveries on the west coast of Australia were not
the result of design, but were accidental&mdash;or, at least,
unpremeditated.</p>
<p>When the Hollanders first made their way to the East Indies,
they naturally followed the old routes taken by their Portuguese
predecessors and rivals. After rounding the Cape of Good Hope,
they shaped their course either inside or outside Madagascar, and
thence made their way as best they could&mdash;either north to
India or east to Java. This route had many disadvantages.
Numerous rocks and islands, the position of which were
imperfectly known, lay in the track, and were a constant source
of danger. The south-east trade winds drove the ships to the
northward, and, as they got into the tropics, they met with
light, variable, and baffling winds, which delayed them for long
weeks, so that it was no uncommon thing for the outward voyage to
last thirteen months. Nor was the loss of time, and consequent
damage to cargo, the only evil. Scurvy&mdash;the scourge of all
early voyagers&mdash;produced by the long and exclusive use of
salt diet, attacked the crews. Many died, and the survivors
arrived at their destination broken down by sickness, and often
short of provisions and water.</p>

<br>
<p>Bad as the Madagascar route was, the Dutch, for more than
fifteen years, were unable to find a better. At last, however, in
December, 1611, Commander Hendrik Brouwer, who had sailed with
two ships from Holland to the east, wrote to the Council of
Seventeen, reporting his arrival at Java. After leaving the Cape,
he had run due east, in about 36&deg; S. lat., for some 3000
miles. He had kept a strong south-westerly wind for 28 days, and
had reached Batavia, after a passage of less than seven months,
having lost only two men from sickness. This was unprecedented;
and he strongly advised that all outward-bound ships should be
ordered to take the south route, by which they might make sure of
short passages&mdash;seeing that if they failed to get west winds
in 36&deg; S. they would be certain to do so if they ran to
40&deg; or 44&deg; S. Although the long distance run to the south
seemed a disadvantage, it was largely compensated for by the gain
of running down the easting in a high latitude. It was open sea
all the way in this southern ocean, with none of the rocks and
dangers which beset the northern route, and the coolness of the
weather was of great importance to the health of the crews.</p>
<p>In consequence of Brouwer's report, seconded by the
recommendation of Governor-General Coen, the Directors ordered
their outward-bound ships to take the new route. Rewards were
offered for quick passages&mdash;150 guilders for a passage under
nine months, 600 guilders if they arrived within seven months.
The superiority of the new route was soon apparent. Of three
ships sailing at the same time from Holland, in 1614, the
<i>Hardt</i> took Brouwer's route, and reached Batavia in six
months, while the two others, by the Madagascar passage, were 16
and 18 months in making the voyage. It was in running far east
under the new sailing directions that, in 1616, the ship
<i>Eendragt</i> (<i>Concord</i>) first sighted the South Land
(<i>i.e., the west coast of Australia</i>), in 26&deg; S. lat.,
at Shark Bay; her captain Dirk Hartog, landing on an island which
still bears his name, and putting up an inscribed metal plate,
which remained there up to the early part of the present century.
The voyage was not without danger, as an English ship, the
<i>Tryal</i>, found to her cost; for, following the new Dutch
route, in 1621, she ran on to the Trial Rocks, in 20&deg; S.
lat., and was totally wrecked, only a few of her crew succeeding
in reaching Batavia in the boats.</p>
<p>From Hartog's ship, the new discovery received the name of
Eendragt Land, and, in the next four or five years the captains
of other ships on the same voyage sighted the west coast, amongst
them Edel and Houtman, who, in 1619, made the South Land, in
32&frac12;&deg; S. lat.&mdash;north of the present site of
Perth&mdash;and sailed along it some hundreds of miles, giving it
the name of Edel Land, and also naming Houtman's Abrolhos.</p>
<p>Instructions were issued by the Directors, in 1620, and 1621,
that outward-bound ships leaving the Cape should keep an east
course between 30&deg; and 40&deg; S. lat. for 4000 miles, or
until they should sight the "New Southland of the Eendragt" With
our modern notions, these instructions appear extraordinary, but
in the then existing state of navigation they were practical and
well-judged. The appliances at the command of ship captains in
those days were very imperfect. Without the sextant or the
chronometer there was the greatest, difficulty in determining the
ship's position. It is true that they could find the latitude by
the cross-staff with reasonable accuracy, but they had no means
of finding the longitude, except by the rude process of dead
reckoning by the log. They had no reliable charts, and had to
depend very largely either on their own personal experience of
former voyages, or on the advice of pilots who had sailed the
seas before. It was, therefore, no uncommon thing at the end of a
long voyage for the captain to find himself some hundreds of
miles out of his reckoning&mdash;sometimes even as much as 400 or
600 miles. Thus Brouwer, in the voyage above-mentioned, made
Sumatra, when, according to his estimated position on the chart,
he was still 320 miles to the westward of the island. The object
of the new instructions was, therefore, to enable the ships to
ascertain their position after their long run to the east. When
they made the Southland, they ran to the north, along the coast,
until they reached the known point of Eendragt Land, in 25&deg;
or 26&deg; S. lat. Prom this they took a new departure, and, by
steering a N.N.W. course, could make pretty sure of striking the
south coast of Java. The new plan led to several ships sighting
various parts of the west coast of Australia in the course of the
next six or seven years. Amongst others, the despatch jacht
<i>Leeuwin</i> (<i>Lioness</i>), in 1622, doubled the Cape, to
which she gave her name. Even by the new route, the voyage to the
Indies was often very protracted, the <i>Leeuwin</i>, for
instance, taking 13 months to reach Batavia. There was also the
danger of overshooting the mark, as Pieter Nuyts found (1627),
when, in the <i>Gulde Zeepaert</i> (<i>Golden Seahorse</i>), he
found himself at the islands of St. Peter and St. Francis, at the
head of the Great Australian Bight, and had to coast back some
hundreds of miles until he could round Cape Leeuwin.</p>
<p>The new discoveries quickly attracted the attention and
interest, not only of the Colonial Government, but of the Home
Directors, and were a frequent subject of correspondence between
the Council of Seventeen and their Governors-General. As early as
1618, the Directors wrote to Governor-General Coen respecting the
discovery of a great land situate to the south of Java, reported
by the ship <i>Eendragt</i>, Commanders Houtman, Edel, and
others, recommending that ships should be sent to examine it, and
report on its inhabitants and resources, and the opening it might
offer for profitable trade; and, also, to try to find a passage
eastward into the Great South Sea. Accordingly, in the next few
years, several attempts at systematic exploration were made, but
with little success. The only result was the discovery by the
ships <i>Pera</i> and <i>Arnhem</i>, in 1623, of a portion of the
north coast of Australia (now part of the Northern Territory of
South Australia), which was named Arnhem Land, and the naming of
the Gulf of Carpentaria, after the Governor-General
Carpentier.</p>
<p>One further addition to the knowledge of these coasts was made
by De Wit, whose ship, the <i>Vianen</i>, leaving the East
Indies, in January, 1628, in the north-west monsoon, was driven
on to the north-west coast of Australia, about the Kimberley
District, and who named the country De Wit Land.</p>
<p>The total result of these various discoveries and explorations
was that the coast of Australia, from Cape York on the north to
the centre of the Great Australian Bight on the south, had been
traced more or less continuously by Dutch ships in the twelve
years between 1616 and 1628. This coast was now called by the
Dutch "The Known South Land", to differentiate it from those
unexplored and supposititious regions for which, with practical
sense, they retained the old appellation of "The Unknown South
Land". Down to very recent times, the names of these early Dutch
discoveries were retained on the maps of Western Australia. Half
a century ago, when across the centre of Australia was written
the simple word "Unexplored", almost the only names appearing on
the Western Coast were those given 200 years before by the
captains of the ships of the Dutch East India Company in the
early years of the 17th century. Beginning with Nuyts Land, in
the Great Australian Bight, and going north, we had Leeuwin Land,
Edel Land, Eendragt Land, De Wit Land, and Arnhem Land. A few
names still remain as evidence of the Dutch
discoveries&mdash;Cape Leeuwin, Houtman's Abrolhos, Dirk Hartog's
Island, and the Gulf of Carpentaria.</p>
<p>Such was the state of Dutch knowledge of Australia when Antony
Van Diemen became Governor-General of the Dutch Indies, in the
year 1636. Van Diemen was one of the most notable of the many
notable men who served the East India Company in the early years
of its power. Being involved in debt, he had gone to the Indies,
either to escape his creditors or to retrieve his fortunes. He
showed so much capacity that he was appointed Secretary to
Governor-General Coen. From this time his rise was rapid. In
1626, he became one of the Councillors of the Indies, and, after
important services, he was appointed Governor-General, in
1636.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Du Bois; <i>Vies des Gouverneurs
G&eacute;n&eacute;raux</i>.]</p>
<p>He came to his government at a time when the Dutch power had
been so firmly consolidated by Coen, Carpentier, Brouwer, and
others of his predecessors in office, that the Dutch were
undisputed masters of the Eastern Archipelago, and had a virtual
monoply of the trade. Freed from the difficulties with the native
powers and foreign rivals which had embarrassed his predecessors,
he had the leisure and the means to prosecute new enterprises.
His zeal for discoveries which might bring increased wealth and
power to his Company was unbounded, and is shown not only by his
frequent despatches on the subject to the Council of Seventeen in
Holland, but by the expeditions which he planned and sent out
during the term of his nine years' government.</p>
<p>It will be observed that the first attempts at exploration
from the Dutch East India Settlements were directed to the
regions east of the Banda Sea, and had for their chief object the
exploration of New Guinea, and especially the determination of
the question whether New Guinea and the known South Land formed
one continent, or whether there was a strait between them by
which access could be gained to the Great South Sea. It was to
the solution of this problem that Van Diemen first applied
himself in the very year in which he received his appointment as
Governor-General, ignorant of the fact that the Spaniard Torres
had already solved the problem by sailing through the strait that
now bears his name, in the year 1606.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The discovery of Torres remained unknown until
the English took Manilla in 1762, and discovered in the Archives
a copy of Torres' original letter to the King of Spain. Set
Major; <i>Early Voyages</i>.]</p>
<p>In the year 1636, Van Diemen despatched two ships from Banda,
under the command of Captain Gerrit Thomasz Pool, with
instructions to proceed along the south coast of New Guinea. If,
contrary to all expectations, a strait was found between New
Guinea and the South Land, Pool was to sail through it, and
trace, if possible, the east coast of the Known South Land,
circumnavigating it, and returning home along Nuyts Land and
Eendragt Land. If, however, as seemed most probable, New Guinea
was joined to the Known South Land, he was to sail along the
northern and western coasts of Australia as far south as
Houtman's Abroehos, searching all the way for any possible
passage to the Pacific. More particularly was he to search the
more northerly parts, as it was presumed that a strait was more
likely to be found in that quarter than further south, where the
South Land was, presumably, much wider. If Pool, with some of his
crew had not been murdered by the savages of New Guinea, it is
possible that he might have sailed through the strait already
traversed by Torres, and have anticipated Captain Cook in the
discovery of New South Wales. As it happened, however, the ships
returned without having discovered anything of importance. In the
same year, Van Diemen planned the expedition to search for the
supposed "golden island", east of Japan, which, three years
later, was undertaken by Quast and Tasman, with the result we
have already seen.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">2. <i>The Planning of the Great Discovery
Voyage</i>.</p>
<p>Governor Van Diemen's heart was now set on a complete
exploration of the Unknown South Land, in which he hoped to
discover a new Peru, rich in silver and gold, or, at the least,
fertile countries inhabited by civilised people, in which might
be found new and yet undreamed of commodities, to bring fresh
wealth into the already overflowing coffers of the East India
Company. For some years domestic troubles and the want of
suitable ships delayed the execution of his plans but, in the
year 1641, he writes to the Council of Seventeen:&mdash;"We are
very desirous to make the discovery of the South Land. The
fly-ship <i>Zeehaen</i> was intended for this service, but,
through the strange delay of the ships from Persia and Suratte,
we were compelled to employ this same <i>Zeehaen</i> for the last
voyage to Tayouwan and Japan. Moreover, we have kept here, in the
harbour, idle, as much to his vexation as to our own, the
renowned pilot, Frans Visscher, whom we intend to employ for the
discovery of the South Land; however, this shall, as we hope, be
yet effected, once for all."</p>
<p>This same Frans Jacobszoon, <i>alias</i> Visscher, took an
important part as the adviser of Governor-General Van Diemen in
his plans for the projected voyage of discovery. Visscher was a
native of Flushing, and had been for many years in the service of
the Company. He had repeatedly made the outward and homeward
voyages. In 1623, as mate of the ship <i>Hope</i>, he had sailed
round the world in the celebrated Nassau fleet, under the command
of L'Hermite and Schapenham. He had traded in the East for many
years, chiefly in the Japan trade, and was thoroughly acquainted
with the coasts of Tonquin, China, and Formosa. In those days,
when navigation had not been reduced to a science, and charts
were either wanting or not to be depended on the Dutch captains
in the uncharted eastern seas had to place their chief reliance
for safe and prosperous voyages on the personal experience of
those officers and seamen who, in former voyages, had gained a
knowledge of the coasts and rocks, the currents, and the winds of
the seas they were traversing. These pilots, for the most part,
were jealous of their knowledge, and indisposed to make it
public, notwithstanding the repeated complaints and injunctions
of the Company. Amongst these pilots, Visscher, from his long and
varied experience, and from his skill and capacity, was one of
the most renowned. His knowledge and experience were freely
placed at the disposal of the Company, as is often made matter of
honourable mention in the despatches of the Governor-General. He
had made charts of the coasts and islands of the China Seas, of
Formosa, the Piscadores, and Japan, and is continually referred
to as one of the best chart-makers of his time. It was this man
that Van Diemen consulted on the projected expedition, and, as we
have seen, for this purpose he detained him&mdash;very much to
Visscher's chagrin in those stirring times&mdash;for nine months
in idleness at Batavia, for the benefit of his advice.</p>
<p>In January, 1642, Visscher wrote a report to the
Governor-General on the proposed discovery of the Unknown South
Land. This report is a masterly document, and gives us a high
idea not only of Visscher's practical ability and knowledge as a
seaman, but, also, of his sagacity and sound judgment. The old
pilot wastes no words on fanciful speculations about the
mysterious South Land. He goes straight to the point, states the
conditions necessary for success, discusses possible
difficulties, and, in short and concise terms, lays down a
clearly-defined and carefully-thought-out scheme&mdash;or,
rather, choice of schemes&mdash;for exploring both the Unknown
and the Known South Lands, and, indeed, for obtaining a knowledge
of the whole Southern world.</p>
<p>The report begins with a recommendation that the expedition
should leave Batavia in August, when they would have the most
favourable winds, and have the whole of the summer before them,
with long days and good weather. From Batavia the ships should
first proceed to Mauritius, then a Dutch possession. As the
expedition was intended to go to the east, this, at first sight,
seems a strange recommendation. But there were good grounds for
the advice. Visscher, as we shall see, had certain reasons for
wishing to make the point of departure as far to the west as
possible. Mauritius, moreover, was easily reached with the
south-east trades, and, when there, the ships would have run down
nearly 1000 miles of their southing, and would have a
comparatively short distance to run to the south before reaching
the region of the westerly winds, on which they must depend for
success. Moreover, at Mauritius, and this is the only reason
explicitly stated in the report, they could conveniently take in
wood, water, and other supplies necessary for the voyage.</p>
<p>Leaving Mauritius, early in October, the ships were to get
away south, as quickly as possible, to 51&deg; or 54&deg; south
latitude, or until they fell in with land. From this point they
should run due east upon the same latitude to the longitude of
the east end of New Guinea, and then steer a course north by west
until they got New Guinea on board; or else they might run
further to the east to the supposed longitude of the Solomon
Islands&mdash;or, perhaps, 500 or 700 miles beyond&mdash;then
steer north, explore those islands&mdash;where, according to-all
accounts, they would find many things worth their
trouble&mdash;and return by the north coast of New Guinea to
Banda or Amboyna.</p>
<p>But Visscher had an alternative scheme, or, rather, a
combination of two schemes, by which a much more complete
exploration could be made. If an exploring expedition was fitted
out in Holland, the ships might make the Cape of Good Hope, and
thence sail south to latitude 54&deg; S., or make Rio Janeiro,
and begin from the east side of Staten Land, near Cape Horn; in
either case, running east to the longitude of the Solomon
Islands, and making the homeward voyage as before. Such a voyage
would give a knowledge of the whole Southern Ocean from Cape Horn
to the Solomon Islands, Of course, if land was met with, the
plans would be modified, but Visscher, apparently, had not much
faith in the common belief in a huge Southern Continent, at least
in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. About the South Pacific he was
more doubtful. Here the difficulty of exploration would be
greater. The strong westerly winds prevailing in the latitude of
Cape Horn would make it impossible for any ship to make the
voyage to the west in a high latitude; but if the Dutch had a
settlement in Chili, the expedition might start from there, and
run up into the Tropics with the south-east trades to latitude
12&deg; or 15&deg; S., crossing the Pacific in that latitude
until it made the Solomons. If they could only be sure of getting
refreshment at the Solomons, this would be an excellent plan, for
they could then sail south from the Solomons, and, getting into
westerly winds, run back east to the Strait of Le Maire and Cape
Horn.</p>
<p>By the accomplishment of these two voyages, says Visscher.
"You will be able to explore the southern portion of the world
round about the whole globe, and find out what is there; whether
it be land, or sea, or icebergs&mdash;whatever God has ordained
to be there." The old pilot's views as to the South Land, and the
best means to search for it, show that he was in advance of his
time, and free from many of the traditional prepossessions then
common amongst navigators and geographers. If the Council of
Seventeen could only have been induced to enter into Visscher's
plans, the riddle of the South Land might have been solved in the
17th century, and the discoveries of Captain Cook anticipated by
more than one hundred and twenty years.</p>
<p>These large schemes were beyond the province of the East India
Government, but the plan Visscher had sketched far the expedition
from Batavia was adopted in its entirety. Van Diemen, in his
despatches, describes the voyage as having been projected on the
advice of Visscher. The resolution of the Governor-General and
Council, decreeing the expedition, is dated 1st August, 1642. It
begins by stating the great desire of both the Colonial and Home
Governments for the exploration of southern and eastern lands,
with the hope of opening up important countries for trade, or, at
least, of finding a more convenient way to the rich countries
already known in South America. The Governor then states that he
has consulted divers persons of approved judgment in such
matters, and especially the renowned and most experienced pilot,
Frans Jacobsz Visscher, as to the explorations and the best way
to accomplish them, and, in accordance with their written
opinions, has decided to despatch for the discovery of these
apparently rich countries two ships,* the <i>Heemskerck</i>, with
a crew of 60 men, and the fly-ship <i>Zeehaen</i>
(<i>Cormorant</i>), with 50. The expedition to be under the
command of the Hon. Abel Tasman, who is very eager to make the
exploration; with him are to be associated the said Pilot-Major
Visscher, and other capable officers.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The <i>Heemskerck</i> was a jagt or small
ship, perhaps 200 tons. The <i>Zeehaen</i> was a fluit or
fly-boat, a vessel of light draught, built for quick sailing; she
was smaller than the <i>Heemskerck</i>.]</p>
<p>The ships were ready for sea. The <i>Heemskerck</i> had for
skipper Ide Tjercxszoon, the <i>Zeehaen</i> Gerrit Janszoon.
Tasman, as commander, and Visscher, as pilot-major, were on board
the <i>Heemskerck</i>, Gilsemans, the merchant, or supercargo, on
the <i>Zeehaen</i>. In all Dutch discovery and trading
expeditions, the merchant, or supercargo, was an important
personage. He had the direction of the commercial
part&mdash;which in the Company's voyages was the chief part of
the undertaking&mdash;and, consequently, had a large voice in the
direction of the expedition. Gilsemans is spoken of as having a
competent knowledge of navigation, and as being also a skilful
draftsman, and it is doubtless to his capable pencil that we owe
the vigorous sketches which illustrate the original journal of
the voyage.</p>
<p>The instructions to Tasman were printed by Swart, in 1859, and
are entitled, "Instructions for the Captain-Commander, Abel Jansz
Tasman, the Pilot-Major, Franchoys Jacobsz Visscher, and the
Council of the ship <i>Heemskerck</i> and fly-boat the
<i>Zeehaen</i>, destined for the exploration of the Unknown and
Discovered Southland, the South-east Coast of New Guinea, with
the Islands lying round about." They begin with an elaborate
exordium recounting the priceless riches, profitable commerce,
useful traffic, excellent dominion, great might and power, which
the kings of Castile and Portugal had brought to their crowns by
the discovery of America by Columbus, and of the Cape route to
the Indies by Vasco da Gama; likewise, what uncounted blind
heathen had thus come to the wholesome light of the Christian
religion. Yet, hitherto, no serious attempt had been made by any
Christian king, prince, or republic, to explore the still unknown
part of the globe situated in the south, which might be supposed
to be as great as either the old or the new world, and might,
with good reason, be expected to contain many excellent and
fruitful countries, and also lands as rich in mines of precious
metals as the gold and silver provinces of Peru, Chili, or
Sofala. No European colony was so suitable for the starting-point
of such an expedition as the town of Batavia, situated in the
centre of the known and unknown Eastern India; therefore, the
Governor and Council of India had resolved to take the discovery
in hand, and to despatch for that service the ships
<i>Heemskerck</i> and <i>Zeehaen</i>.</p>
<p>The instructions then prescribe the course which the vessels
are to take, following exactly the recommendations of Visscher's
report, except that, if the ship's council, for any sufficient
reason, thought it best, they might vary the route by making the
east end of the known South Land, or the islands of St. Peter and
St. Francis, at the head of the Great Australian Bight, and then,
sailing due north, along the coast (which, it was presumed, would
here turn to the north), to try to discover a passage between it
and New Guinea. However, this was not recommended; the course
advised being to keep on south latitude 48&deg; to 54&deg; until
400 to 800 miles east of the supposed longitude of the Solomon
Islands, so as to be assured that there was a way through from
the Indies to the South Pacific, which would give a short route
to Chili.</p>
<p>Minute directions are given for the survey and description of
lands discovered; observation of winds, currents, and weather;
precautions to be taken in navigation; discipline and rations of
the crews; care in conciliating the natives, and avoiding any
injury to them; precautions to be observed against possible
treachery when landing from boats; and injunctions to obtain
information as to the resources of the countries visited, and the
possibilities of trade with them.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that this, like other Dutch expeditions,
was essentially commercial. It was no scientific or adventurous
thirst for discovery that prompted these old Dutchmen, but plain,
practical business, and the hope of profit for the Company. The
merchant to whom was entrusted the management of the commercial
venture had a large voice in the direction of the expedition.
Consequently, the instructions are specially precise in their
injunctions to enter in the journal full particulars of the
productions of the countries, what sort of goods the people had
for trade, and what they would take in exchange. For this purpose
the ships were laden with a great variety of articles of
merchandise. Gold and silver were specially to be sought for,
but, says the Governor-General, with cynical candour, "Keep them
ignorant of the value of the same, appear as if you were not
greedy for them; and, if gold or silver is offered in any barter,
you must feign that you do not value those metals, showing them
copper, zinc, and lead, as if those minerals were of more value
with us."</p>
<p>Tasman was to hoist his flag on the <i>Heemskerck</i> as
commander of the expedition, and was to preside in the ship's
council, consisting of skippers of the two ships, Pilot-Major
Visscher, the chief mates, and the two merchants. The commander
had a deliberative and a casting vote. In the administration of
justice, the boatswains were also to be summoned, and have votes.
But, in all matters which concerned navigation, such as courses
to be steered, and discovery of lands, the Pilot-Major was to
have two votes, and his advice to be held in proper respect,
seeing that the voyage had been projected on his advice and
information. In these matters, too, the second mates were to have
votes.</p>
<p>In case of Tasman's death, the skipper of the
<i>Heemskerck</i>, Ide Tjercxszoon, was to succeed to the
command.</p>
<p>The Instructions conclude:&mdash;"We commend you to the
blessing of the Almighty, whom we pray to endue you with manly

<br>
<p align="center">3. <i>The Voyage of</i> 1642.</p>
<p>The next day (14th August), the ships sailed from Batavia, and
on this day Tasman's Journal begins as follows:&mdash;"Journal or
description by me, Abel Jansz Tasman, of a voyage made from the
Town of Batavia, in the East Indies, for the discovery of the
Unknown Southland, in the year Anno 1642, the 14th August. May it
please Almighty God to grant his blessing thereto! Amen."</p>
<p>Sailing through the Sunda Strait, the ships carried the
south-east trades with them to Mauritius, where they arrived 5th
September, after an exceptionally quick passage of 22 days. An
entry in Tasman's Journal shows us how hopelessly abroad the best
sailors in those days were in regard to longitude. He says, "By
our reckoning, we were still 200 miles to the east of Mauritius
when we saw it." And he mentions the arrival, at the same time,
of another ship, the <i>Arent</i>, outward bound, which had made
the Island of Rodrigues, in the belief that it was Mauritius,
because it lay in nearly the same latitude, though 300 miles to
the eastward.</p>
<p>They had other difficulties to contend with. A letter from Van
der Stel, the Dutch Commandant at Mauritius, to the
Governor-General at Batavia, states that the ships arrived in a
very bad condition, and wanting almost everything. The
<i>Zeehaen</i> was partly rotten, and in need of extensive
repairs. Both ships were leaky, their rigging was old and weak,
their yards and other spars frequently giving way. To refit the
ships, caulk the seams throughout, strengthen the rigging, cut
the ship spare spars, took the crews nearly a month. Meantime,
they took in supplies of water, firewood, and other stores; and
added to their stock of provisions by shooting wild hogs, wild
goats, and other game abounding in the woods. Van der Stel gave
to Tasman journals and maps relating to the Solomon Islands, and
vocabularies of the languages of those islands, and of New
Guinea. The ships were ready for sea on 4th October, but, through
contrary winds, they could not get out of the harbour of Fort
Fredrik Hendrik until the 8th. Taking a departure from the south
end of Mauritius,* Tasman stood to the southward, getting
variable winds to 31&deg; or 32&deg; S., when he came into the
westerly winds. Passing far to the west of St. Paul's and
Amsterdam, and between those islands and Kerguelen, he came, in
43&deg; S., on floating seaweed and other indications of land.
The ship's council was called together, and it was resolved to
keep a man constantly on the look-out at the masthead, and to
offer as a reward to whoever should first see land three reals of
eight and a mug of arrack. On 29th October, three weeks out, he
made 46&deg; S. latitude, and, meeting with strong gales and
fogs, thought it too dangerous to keep a southerly course, for
fear of falling in with land. The course was, therefore, changed
to nearly east. On 6th November, four weeks out, he reached his
highest latitude, 49&deg; 4' S., seeing many indications of land,
which kept him anxious.</p>
<p class="foot">[* As might be expected, Tasman's longitudes are
very inexact. They are reckoned east from the meridian of the
Peak of Teneriffe. His longitude for the south point of
Mauritius, when reduced to the meridian of Greenwich, is 3&deg;
33' easterly of the true longitude. Similarly, that of Batavia is
4&deg; 23' too easterly.]</p>
<p>The Pilot-Major now delivered to Tasman an elaborate paper, in
which he carefully discussed the future course of the voyage. He
proposed that they should fall off to 44&deg; S. latitude until
they had passed the 150th meridian,* when he judged that, if they
had not made the Southern Continent, they would be in an open
sea. Then they should fall off to 40&deg; S., and sail east to
220&deg; longitude (about 160&deg; W. according to our
reckoning), which he judged would bring them well to the eastward
of the Solomons, and enable them to make these islands with the
south-east trades&mdash;as, indeed, it would, seeing that this
would be about 15&deg; east of the true position of the
Solomons.</p>
<p class="foot">[* About 130&deg; E. of Greenwich&mdash;nearly
the longitude of the head of the Great Australian Bight.]</p>
<p>This resolution was communicated to the <i>Zeehaen</i> by
enclosing the paper in a wooden case, and floating it astern by a
long line for the <i>Zeehaen</i> to pick up. The councils of both
ships having given their approval, the course was altered
accordingly, and, on 18th November, they passed the longitude of
Nuyts Land (Great Australian Bight), the furthest known extension
of the discovered South Land. Here they had heavy westerly gales,
and gradually fell off to lat. 42&deg; 25', when, on the 24th
November, they sighted their first land, which they called Antony
Van Diemen's Land, after the Governor-General.</p>
<p>This landfall was somewhere to the north of Point Hibbs, on
the West Coast of Tasmania, probably near the entrance of
Macquarie Harbour&mdash;Mounts Heemskirk and Zeehan ** being
noticeable objects to the north-east. After standing off for the
night, the ships next day made the land again, approaching within
one Dutch mile (<i>i.e</i>., four English miles) of Point Hibbs.
By carefully comparing reckonings, the longitude was fixed at
163&deg; 50',*** and a new departure taken. The wind now came
easterly with thick weather, so that they could not see the land.
Rounding South-West Cape, they got the wind from the north, and
sailed along the south coast. Tasman named the outlying islands
and some peaks on the broken coast, which he mistook for islands,
after members of the Council of India&mdash;Wit, Maatsuyker,
Sweers, and Boreel. Passing between Pedra Branca and the main,
and rounding the Friars (which he called Boreel Islands), south
of Bruni, Tasman stood up for Adventure Bay, but was caught in a
violent north-west gale, which drove the ships out to sea. From
this incident, the Day received its well-known name of Storm Bay.
Rounding Tasman's Island, on the 1st December, he came to an
anchor off what is now known, as Blackman's Bay, but, which
Tasman called Fredrik Hendrik Bay, in honour of the Stadtholder
of the United Provinces. His anchorage was off Green Island, near
Cape Frederick Henry, on Forestier's Peninsula. Next day,
Pilot-Major Visscher was sent in the <i>Zeehaen</i>'s boat
through the narrows, to explore Fredrik Hendrik (or Blackman's
Bay). On the 3rd, Tasman, with two boats, made for a little bay,
now known as Prince of Wales Bay,**** but the wind was so stiff
from the south-east that the <i>Zeehaen</i>'s launch, with
Visscher and Gilsemans on board, had to run back to the ship. The
<i>Heemskerck</i>'s longboat with Tasman on board, made the bay,
but the surf was too high to allow of landing. The carpenter,
therefore, swam through the surf, and, planting the Prince's flag
on shore, took formal possession of the newly-discovered
country.</p>
<p class="foot">[** These mountains were so named by Flinders
when he made the first circumnavigation of Tasmania in the
Norfolk in 1798.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** East from Teneriffe.]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** Mr. Gell thinks that this Prince of Wales
Bay is the Fredrik Hendrik Bay of Tasman.]</p>
<p>On the 4th December, Tasman weighed anchor, intending to sail
northwards, along the coast, and take in water; the wind,
however, was unfavourable, blowing from the north-west, and,
being unable to hold the land aboard, the ship's council resolved
to stand away to the east. After naming Maria Island, Schouten
Island, and Van der Lyn (Freycinet Peninsula), he took his
departure from "a high round mountain"&mdash;probably St.
Patrick's Head, or, perhaps, St. Paul's Dome.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Tasman's longitudes, reduced to the meridian
of Greenwich are for Point Hibbs, 147&deg; 11'; for the anchorage
off Green Island, 150&deg; 51'. The true longitudes are 145&deg;
15' and 148&deg; 1' respectively. The first shows an error of
1&deg; 56', the second an error of 2&deg; 50', thus making
Tasmania too broad by nearly one whole degree of longitude.<br>
<br>
In the Papers and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Tasmania
for 1890, is a paper by the present writer, in which the
localities mentioned by Tasman in his journal are identified and
described.]</p>
<p>Steering due east from the coast of Antony Van Diemen's Land,
after nine days, he sighted land again (13th December). This was
the west coast of the South Island of New Zealand, to the south
of Cook's Strait.</p>
<p>In an interesting paper by Dr. T. M. Hocken, of Dunedin, on
Tasman's discoveries in New Zealand, it is stated that "the great
high land" that Tasman first saw is situated between Hokitika and
Okarito. Further north, the low point described in the journal is
Cook's Cape Foul wind, with its outlying rocks, the Steeples,
near "Westport. North of this, the Karamea Bight, and the
"furthermost point, which stood out so boldly that we had no
doubt it was the extreme point", is Cook's Cape Farewell.</p>
<p>Coasting north-eastwards, he made a bay on the north coast of
the South Island, where he anchored. Here the Maoris, in their
war canoes, attacked one of the <i>Zeehaen</i>'s boats, killed
three of the crew, and mortally wounded a fourth man. Tasman gave
this bay the name of Moordenaars (or Massacre) Bay. He says,
"This is the second land we have discovered; we have given it the
name of the Staten Land, in honour of Their High Mightinesses the
States General, and also because it may be that this land is
joined to Staten Land (near Cape Horn), but this is uncertain. It
appears to be a very fine country. Believing that this is the
main continent of the Unknown Southland, we have given this
strait the name of Abel Tasman's Passage, as he has been the
first to sail through it." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** The English Admiralty has lately given to the
sea between Australia and New Zealand the name of the Tasman
Sea.]</p>
<p>Massacre Bay is near the western entrance of Cook's Strait; it
is now called Golden Bay, and the scene of the tragedy, according
to Dr. Hocken, lies close to Parapara.</p>
<p>Although Tasman noted a south-east current, and suspected that
there must be a passage, the weather was so bad that he did not
stay to look for it; if he had done so, he would have sailed
through Cook's Strait, and corrected his idea that he had found
the Great Southern Continent. However, he sailed north, along the
west coast of the North Island, and sighted the Three Kings
Islands, on which they would have landed to get fresh water, but
were deterred by seeing thirty or forty men of uncommon stature,
who showed themselves in a threatening attitude. He did not land
in New Zealand, partly on account of bad weather, and partly
owing to the hostile attitude of the Maoris. After rounding the
north of New Zealand, he steered north-east, after consultation
with the ship's council, and found a great swell from the
south-east, which must have made him doubt the existence of the
great Southern Continent. It did, indeed, assure him that here
was a clear passage from Batavia to Chili. Still holding a
north-east course, on 21st January, he came to several islands,
to which he gave the names of Amsterdam, Middleburg, and
Roterdam, now known as Tongataboo, Eooa, and Annamooka, part of
the Tonga, or Friendly, Group. He was very hospitably received by
the natives, and, after a few days' stay, he weighed anchor (1st
February), and, after discovering Willems' Shoals, south-east of
Fiji, by the advice of Visscher and the Council he stood north by
west to 5&deg; or 6&deg; S. lat., and then west for New Guinea.
He sailed along the north coast of New Guinea, and arrived at
Batavia on 15th June, 1643, after an absence of ten months,
during which he had lost ten men by sickness, besides the four
men killed by the Maoris. His journal concludes thus:&mdash;"God
be praised and thanked for a safe voyage! Amen."</p>
<br>
<p align="center">4. <i>The Voyage of</i> 1644.</p>
<p>Tasman had not, as Van Diemen had hoped, discovered any rich
gold or silver mines, or, indeed, any rich trade for the Company,
but he had circumnavigated New Holland, or, as he called it on
his chart, "Compagnies Nieuw Nederlandt", and had found a clear
way to Chili, which opened up a good prospect for trade, or, at
least, for great spoil, to be come at from the Spanish
settlements in South America. From this last Governor-General Van
Diemen hoped much: On 4th January, 1644, he wrote to the Home
Directory that he contemplated fitting out a fleet in September
to open up a Chili trade, and to plunder the Spaniards in Peru.
He also intended to send two or three ships to make an
examination of the newly-discovered South Land, which Tasman had
not found possible. For he hoped that such great countries must
contain much that would be profitable to the Company, and
especially gold and silver mines, as in Peru, Chili, and Japan.
But, in the meantime, it would much facilitate the attempts on
Chili and Peru if a shorter passage could be found between New
Guinea and the Known South Land. This, the Governor-General
announced, was to be immediately undertaken by two ships and a
smaller vessel under the same commanders as before,
viz.&mdash;Commander Tasman and Pilot-Major Frans Visscher;
Gilsemans was again to be merchant, or supercargo.</p>

<br>
<p>On 13th January, 1644, by resolution of the Governor-General
in Council, the ships <i>Limmen</i> and <i>Zeemeeuw</i> (<i>Sea
Gull</i>), with the little tender <i>Braek</i> (<i>Setter</i>),
carrying only 14 men, were commissioned for the work. They
carried a complement of 111 hands, and were provisioned for 8
months. On 29th January, the instructions for the voyage were
drawn up and signed. They were printed in England by Mr. Major,
in 1859.* They contain a most interesting and valuable summary of
former Dutch voyages and discoveries in the South Land. The
vessels were to coast along the south and west coasts of New
Guinea to the furthest discovery in 17&deg; S. lat. (<i>i.e</i>.,
in the Gulf of Carpentaria), and endeavour to find a strait or
passage into the South Sea. If a strait was found, which might be
known by the south-east swell running through it, they were to
sail through it, and thence as far to the south-east as the new
Van Diemen's Land. From thence they were to make the islands of
St. Peter and St. Francis, and run along the coast of the Known
Southland to De Wit Land, in 22&deg; S. lat., when the Known
Southland would be circumnavigated, and be found to be the
largest island in the globe. But if, as was to be presumed, New
Guinea was joined to the South Land, forming one continent, then
they were to run along the coast to 28&deg; S. to the Land of
Eendragt and Houtman's Abrolhos, and thence return to
Batavia.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Early voyages to Terra
Australis.&mdash;Hakluyt Society, 1859.]</p>
<p>The ships sailed from Batavia next day (30th December, 1644).
The journals of the voyage are lost, and we have only the
briefest notices of the expedition.** But Tasman's chart shows
the route of the ships. For some: reason or other, probably on
account of the wind, Tasman and Visscher did not follow the
instructions exactly. Instead of sailing first to New Guinea,
they made a straight-course to the Land of Eendragt. From thence
Tasman coasted northwards, and carefully charted, with soundings,
the west and north coasts of Australia, including the Gulf of
Carpentaria. He actually got into the mouth of Torres Strait, but
did not discover the passage. Probably he was deterred from
further examination by the multitude of islands and reefs that
block the way, and was, moreover, ignorant of the fact that the
Spaniard Torres had, in 1606, sailed through the strait from the
east. Failing to find the strait, he returned along the south
coast of New Guinea to Batavia, where he arrived in August,
1644.</p>
<p class="foot">[** N. Witsen: "Noord en Oost Tartarye",
translated, by R. H. Major, in "Early Voyages to Terra Australis"
pp. 91-98. The journal has been sought for in vain both in
Holland and at Batavia, especially by Messrs. Van der Chijs and
Norman, in 1862.]</p>
<p>Van Diemen, in his despatch to the Home Directory, the Council
of Seventeen (23rd December, 1644), reports the result of the
voyage, and expresses his discontent and disappointment that the
expedition had not discovered a strait between New Guinea and the
Known South Land, but only a great bay or gulf, and, also, that
they had done nothing but sail along the coasts, and had gained
no knowledge of the country and its productions, alleging as a
reason that they were not strong enough to venture to land in
face of the savages. This was very disappointing, since
discoveries were of little use unless the country was explored at
the same time. "For it is certain that, so long as we merely run
along the coasts and shores, we shall very slowly open up
anything profitable, it being well known to everybody that the
coast people are ordinarily poor, miserable, and evil disposed;
therefore, we must go inland." (Letter: 29 Nov.) Yet, he says,
Tasman, in his two voyages, had circumnavigated the hitherto
Unknown South Land, which was calculated to have an extent of
8000 miles of coast; and it was very improbable that, in so great
a country, with such a variety of climates, there should not be
found something of great importance and profit for the Company.
There were, also, the great northern lands of America, which had
been made accessible by the new discoveries, and every
opportunity would be taken to explore them, from time to time, by
vigilant and courageous persons; "for", says Van Diemen, "the
discovery of new countries is not work for everyone." "God
grant", he concludes, "that, in either one or the other
(<i>i.e</i>., in North America or the South Land), may be found a
rich silver or gold mine, to the satisfaction of those engaged in
the venture, and to the honour of the finders." It is plain that
Van Diemen was dissatisfied with Tasman. He had looked for
immediate results in the extension of trade, or, at least, for
the finding of the New Guinea strait, and, disappointed in this,
he could not appreciate the importance of the discoveries from a
geographical standpoint.</p>
<p>Tasman's services were recognised somewhat grudgingly. By
resolution of the Governor-General and Council (4th Oct., 1644),
his salary was raised to 100 florins (&pound;9 6<i>s</i>.
8<i>d</i>.) per month, and the reasons are stated in measured
language:&mdash;"In which two voyages (of 1642 and 1644), he has
given us reasonable contentment, in respect of his services, and
the duties he has accomplished. It is, therefore, on account of
this, at his request, and in consideration of his ability, also
by reason of his having been again about six years in the
country; and, moreover, that we find in him the spirit to render
further good service to the General Council on like occasions In
searching for rich countries and profitable trade."</p>
<br>
<a name="ch-33" id="ch-33"></a>
<h4>IV. TASMAN'S LATER YEARS, 1644-1659.</h4>
<p>Tasman's failure to find what the Governor-General and the
East India Company wanted&mdash;immediate and profitable
trade&mdash;seems to have brought him under a cloud. He remained
at Batavia, but without any important employment. In October,
1644, he and Frans Visscher laid down a route for an expedition
fitted out to attack the Spanish ships coming from America to
Manilla. But Visscher only was employed on the expedition, and
Martin de Vries in a subsequent one. Tasman was passed over.</p>
<p>Governor-General Van Diemen died in 1645, and with him the era
of great discovery expeditions closed. His successors in the
Government were not animated by the same zeal for exploration and
adventure, but devoted their attention to strictly commercial
matters, and Tasman found small opportunity for distinguishing
himself. He was not wholly neglected. He was appointed (2nd
November, 1644) a member of the Council of Justice at Batavia. It
seems a somewhat inappropriate post for a sailor, but the special
functions allotted to him may explain the appointment, for the
resolution proceeds, "Commissioning and qualifying the said
Tasman to demand and search for the journals of all incoming
ships, and to report to us therefrom what is proper." He still
held this post in December, 1646, but this did not prevent his
occasional employment on more important and, doubtless, more
congenial expeditions. Thus, in September, 1646, we find him
sailing as Captain Commander in a mission to Djambi in Sumatra,
and in August, 1647, going to Siam charged with letters from the
Company to the King. He still kept up his relations with the Home
Country, as there is mention on more than one occasion of his
remitting sums of money to Holland. That he was a man of good
repute amongst his fellow citizens is evidenced by the fact that
in January, 1648, he was elected an elder of the Reformed
Congregation at Batavia.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Church Consistory at Batavia was a body
which exercised a great influence in the Dutch East Indies.
During the time Tasman sat as a member, a subject much discussed
by the Consistory was a proposal for the suppression of Chinese
idolatry, the destruction of all Chinese temples, and the
punishment of the Priests. In April, 1648, the Consistory sent a
Missionary, Dr. Hambroek, to Formosa, where he was shortly
afterwards killed by the natives.&mdash;(Lauts, p. 290.)]</p>
<p>After four years of comparative inactivity, he was once more
entrusted with an important expedition. On 14th May, 1648, he
took command of a fleet of eight ships, with 1150 men, which was
to proceed to Manilla to lie in wait for the Spanish silver ships
from America, to do what mischief it could to the enemy, and
afterwards to sail to Siam. A further object was the suppression
of the Chinese trade to Manilla and the extension of the
Company's monopoly. The expedition was expected to accomplish
great things for the Company. The Governor-General gave a dinner
party to the officers on the eve of their departure, and the
fleet left Batavia confident of success. The result did not
justify their hopes. A descent was made on the island of Luzon
(or Manilla), a number of villages and monasteries were pillaged
and destroyed, and a rich booty carried off, but the main object
of the enterprise was not accomplished. The Chinese trade was not
suppressed, neither did the Dutch fleet capture the silver ships.
One of the Dutch vessels was wrecked in a storm, and the Spanish
ships contrived to escape. Tasman reached Siam in November, and
the conclusion of the Peace of Westphalia, which brought to an
end the Eighty Years War between Spain and the United
Netherlands, put a stop to further hostilities.</p>
<p>The fleet returned to Batavia in January, 1649. An incident
had occurred during the expedition which led to Tasman being
tried before the Criminal Court, 23rd November, 1649. It is
interesting, as giving us one of the few personal glimpses we
have of the man, and as showing the severity with which the
Company visited the delinquencies of their most valued officers,
and vindicated the right of their meanest servants to a fair
trial, even in war time. It must be confessed that the incident
does not present our navigator in a favourable light. According
to the statement of the Advocate Fiscal, or prosecuting counsel,
the facts were as follow:&mdash;In August, 1648, Tasman had
landed at the Baviauw Islands with a military force, and had
pitched a camp. He had issued orders that no one was to go
outside the limits of the camp under pain of capital punishment.
On the next day, "after he and some of his officers had all day
been making good cheer at a certain monastery", on their return
in the evening they came upon one of the supernumeraries and
another sailor rambling outside the camp. Tasman was furious. He
ordered the dilinquents to be seized, and sentenced them to be
hanged on the spot. He himself prepared the rope, and put it
round the neck of the supernumerary, and made his Vice-Commander
Ogel, climb a tree and make fast the rope. This done, Tasman
himself drew away the bench on which the man was standing, and
left him hanging from the tree. He then made a rope ready for the
second man. Luckily Ogel let go "the patient", but only just in
time. Tasman made some defence, but the Court set it aside, and
decided that not even the exigencies of war could excuse the
Commander for hanging a man without a trial. The punishment
inflicted was exemplary. Tasman was sentenced to be suspended
from his office of Commander during the Governor-General's
pleasure, to pay a compensation of 1000 reals to the relatives of
the sailor, a fine of 150 reals, and the costs of suit. In
addition to this, he was to stand bareheaded in open Court, and
publicly declare that he had unjustly and unlawfully, without
form of trial, of his own mere pleasure, and with his own hands,
infamously executed the aforesaid innocent Coenraad Janssen, of
Amsterdam. It would appear that he was at the same time removed
from his office in the Church Consistory&mdash;at least, his name
does not appear in the list of elders for the ensuing year.</p>
<p>The suspension from office lasted two years. In October, 1650,
we find him again employed as Commander, and on the 5th January,
1651, by a resolution of the Governor-General and Council of
India, he was formally reinstated in his rank, his reappointment
to date from the 24th September preceding, when it is said he had
again began to serve the Company.</p>
<p>After this time we have little information about him. It would
appear that he Considered his services were not sufficiently
recognised, or at least that he had grievances which he laid
before the Council of Seventeen in Holland. In October, 1651, the
Directors ordered that a letter of complaint from Abel Jansz
Tasman be enquired into and reported on, but the result of the
inquiry does not appear. In January, 1653, he wrote again to the
Directory, the Colonial authorities curtly noting in the margin,
"Abel Jansz Tasman fails to prove his rash assertions." Whatever
his grievance was, it is evident that he failed to obtain
satisfaction, and that it led to his retirement from the
Company's service. The daily journal of Fort Batavia, two months
later, records, under date 15th March, 1653, the arrival of
Djapara of "Ex-Commander Tasman" in his own private vessel.</p>
<p>Of his last days we know nothing, except that he was a
substantial and well-to-do citizen of Batavia, living just
outside the town on the Tygersgracht (Tiger Canal), one of the
best and wealthiest quarters, and that he had considerable landed
property. There were only a few larger landholders in the town,
amongst them Fran&ccedil;ois Caron, Chief Councillor for India
and Director-General, who has been mentioned as head of the Dutch
Factory in Japan in 1640. Lauts found from a contemporary map of
Batavia that Tasman owned a pleasure garden of nearly six acres
in one quarter, and no less than 282 acres on the Tiger's Canal,
where he resided. Nieuwhoff, who was in the Indies from 1654 to
1670, says that the handsomest buildings in Batavia were situated
on the Tiger's Canal, which was planted on both sides with fine
trees. Valentyn says: "The view of this straight canal, so
beautifully planted, surpasses anything I have ever seen in
Holland."</p>
<p>On 10th April, 1657, Tasman made his Will, which is still
preserved in the Registry of the Probate Court of Batavia. It
opens with the quaint old formula, "In the name of God, Amen!"
and states that the testator is up and about, sick in body, but
having good memory and understanding, and being used to think
upon the shortness of life, that there is nothing more certain
than death, and nothing more uncertain than the hour of the same,
he has therefore resolved to make a solemn testament. First, he
bequeaths twenty-five guilders to the poor of Luytgegarst, his
native village; secondly, to Abel Heylman, his daughter's son,
living in Batavia, a gold cup and silver-mounted sword. All the
remainder of his property he gives to his beloved wife, Joanna
Tjercx. If, however, she marries again, half of her bequest is to
go over to the children of his only daughter, Claesjen. If his
daughter or her children dispute the Will, or require accounts
from the widow, then their half-share is to be reduced to
one-fourth (the ordinary legal portion of a child). After his
widow's death the half is to fall to the children of Claesjen;
but, as to the widow's half, she may use and treat it as her own
free property without contradiction of any.</p>
<p>Tasman had no children by his second wife, Joanna Tjercx.
Claesjen was the daughter of his first wife, Claesgie Heyndricks.
Claesjen had been twice married, and had children by both
husbands. The first, Philip Heylman, held an important office in
the Fort; the second, Jacob Breemer, was an officer of the
Probate Court of Batavia.</p>
<p>In October, 1659, the Will was deposited in the Probate Court
of Batavia; so that Tasman must have died in that year, fifteen
years after his second great voyage.</p>
<p>The great navigators have seldom been long-lived. Magellan and
Cook died at fifty-one, Vasco da Gama at fifty-six. Tasman
reached the latter age.</p>
<p>His widow, though forty-seven years old at her husband's
death, did not long remain unconsoled. Eighteen months later,
under date 5th February, 1661, the daily journal of Batavia
records that permission was granted for the marriage of Jan
Meynderts Springer, burgher of Batavia, to Madame Anna Tjerks,
widow of the deceased Commander Abel Tasman, to be celebrated at
her sick bed in consideration of her severe illness; Springer to
pay to the Church a hundred reals of eight for the privilege.</p>
<p>It remains to mention the well-known story of Tasman's
supposed attachment to a daughter of Governor-General Van Diemen,
evidenced by his naming various places, <i>e.g</i>., Cape Maria
Van Diemen, Maria Island, Maria Bay at Tonga. Flinders first
suggested this little romance in his Voyage to Terra Australis,
published in 1814. It pleased the fancy of the French geographer
Eyries, somewhere about 1820, and has been repeated and enlarged
upon for some eighty years.</p>
<p>It is a pretty story, but, unfortunately for the romance, it
has not the slightest foundation. In the light of recent
investigations Tasman appears as a twice-married man of middle
age, with a grown-up daughter. But this is not conclusive.
Perhaps the next argument against the story is more cogent: Van
Diemen had no daughter. If, however, anyone is still unconvinced,
we may clinch the argument with the express statement of Tasman
attached to one of the drawings in his Journal:&mdash;"We have
named this bay Maria Bay in compliment to the wife of
Governor-General Van Diemen." If anyone after this requires
further proof, let him consult the papers of the Dutch East India
Company, or continue to write sentiment on the ardent young
sailor's unrequited love.</p>
<p>To conclude. Tasman's discoveries, great as they were from a
geographical point of view, bore no fruit for more than a hundred
years. His tracks were marked on the charts, but as to the
countries he discovered, his countrymen in the East Indies, whose
sole object was trade, felt no temptation to explore the wild
bush of Van Diemen's Land, or to face the fierce tribes of
Massacre Bay, or even to plant colonies on the barren and
inhospitable shores of Western Australia, peopled by naked
savages. Only the Englishman Dampier in 1688, and again in 1699,
visited the western coast, and was glad to leave what he
described as the most miserable country on earth. Had Tasman but
discovered the way through Torres Strait, it is possible that New
South Wales might have been colonised by the Dutch. It was
reserved, however, for an English navigator, more than a century
after Tasman's voyage, to make the practical discovery of
Australia as a land for European colonisation. When Captain Cook,
in his first famous voyage in the <i>Endeavour</i>, on Sunday,
29th April, 1770, cast anchor in Botany Bay, the Australian
Continent was first laid open to European enterprise; eighteen
years later Sydney was founded by Englishmen. Would that the
first planting of these Colonies had been other than it was, and
that the wise warning of Lord Bacon had been heeded; for, says
he&mdash;"It is a shameful and unblessed thing to take the scum
of the people and wicked condemned men to be the people with whom
you plant; and not only so, but it spoileth the plantation, for
they will ever live like rogues and not fall to work, but be
lazy, and do mischief, and spend victuals and be quickly weary,
and certify over to their country to the discredit of the
plantation." All which things were verified in the early history
of these Colonies. But Australia "has burst her birth's invidious
bar, and grasped the skirts of happy chance; breasted the blows
of circumstance, and grappled with her evil star; has made by
force her merit known, and lived to clutch the golden keys." A
hundred years' growth has now made Australia well nigh a nation;
but as yet it is a nation in the gristle only. When the petty
jealousies of the Colonies are laid aside, and when the several
States&mdash;as we hope may soon be the case&mdash;are united in
one great Federation, we may feel a perfect confidence that,
amongst the children of the old English mother, not the least
important will be those dwelling in the island Continent
circumnavigated by Tasman two hundred and fifty years ago, who
will claim the title of Citizens of the Commonwealth of
Australia.</p>

<h4>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES.</h4>
<p align="center">MAPS OF THE VOYAGES, 1642 AND 1644.<br>
<br>
<i>Manuscript Maps</i>.</p>
<p class="bindent">1. In the collection of Van Keulen of
Amsterdam. A large and handsome map on Japanese paper, showing
both voyages. Mr. Leupe thinks it to be the work of Pilot-Major
Visscher. Australia bears the name of <i>Compagnis Nieu
Nederlandt</i>. This map was reproduced in coloured facsimile in
Mr. Swart's edition of the complete journal published in
1860.</p>
<p class="bindent">2. In the British Museum. Sloane MSS. 5222,
Art. 12. A large sketch map, roughly executed, showing both
voyages. In the centre of Australia is written "This large Land
of New Guinea was first discovered to joyne to ye South Land by
ye Yot Lemmen as by this Chart Ffrancois Jacobus Vis. Pilot Maior
Anno 1643." Mr. Major, who gives a reduced copy of this chart in
his <i>Early Voyages</i>, thinks it to be a copy of a map by
Visscher, and that it was made by Captain Thomas Bowrey, of Fort
St. George, about 1687. Mr. Alfred Mault, of Hobart, has made a
facsimile of the original map, and this has been
photo-lithographed for the Royal Society of Tasmania.</p>
<p class="bindent">3. In the India Museum, South Kensington. A
coloured Chart of the coast of Van Diemen's Land, endorsed in an
old hand: "A Draught of the South Land lately discovered, 1643."
Mr. A. Mault found this chart amongst the Records of the India
Office. He contributed to the Transactions of the Australasian
Association for the advancement of Science, 1892, a description
of this map, with coloured facsimile.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p align="center"><i>Early Maps</i>.</p>
<p>In 1648, four years after Tasman's second voyage, the building
of the new Stadhuis, or Town Hall of Amsterdam, was begun. The
opportunity was taken to commemorate Tasman's discoveries by
showing them in a great map of the world in two hemispheres, cut
in the stone pavement of the Great Hall (Burgerzaal) of the
Stadhuis. This pavement has long since been boarded over.</p>
<p>Mr. Major says that an outline of the coast visited by Tasman
is given in Turquet's Mappemonde, published in Paris in 1647;
also in the 1650 edition of Janssen's Atlas, and in the 1660
edition of J. Klencke's Atlas. The discoveries are also shown in
Fredk. de Wit's map, published in 1660; and a representation of
the hemispheres is given in the fine work describing the
Stadhuis, and published in 1661. The map in Thévenot (1663) is
from the Stadhuis pavement, but with names added. Some of the
published maps contain the names Hollandia Nova and Zeelandia
Nova.</p>
<p align="center"><small>MANUSCRIPTS OF THE JOURNAL OF
1642.</small></p>
<p>Mr. Leupe describes three contemporary manuscripts which are
preserved in Holland:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bindent">1. R.A. 1. In the State Archives at the Hague.
Consists of 28 double folio leaves, bound in a volume which forms
part of a collection made by Cornelis Sweers. It is badly written
and kept in a slovenly manner, probably by a young officer on
board the <i>Heemskerck</i>.</p>
<p class="bindent">2. R.A. 2. In the State Archives. In a large
folio volume containing 196 pages, very neatly written, with a
large number of charts and drawings, some coloured. It bears the
autograph signature of Tasman, and is apparently a fair copy of
the official journal kept on board the <i>Heemskerck</i>. It is
probably the manuscript used by Valentyn in compiling his
account. He reproduced most of the maps and sketches. This
manuscript, with the charts and drawings, is to be reproduced in
facsimile in Messrs. Fred. Muller &amp; Co.'s forthcoming;
edition.</p>
<p class="bindent">3. H. v. M. In the possession of Mr.
Huydecoper van Marsseveen. In a folio volume, smaller than R.A.
2, contains 112 pages, neatly written, with three small charts
and some sketches. It also is a copy of an original journal, and
is not signed. It has some particulars not given in R.A. 2. It is
from Cornelis Sweers' collection.</p>
<p>The following manuscripts are also known:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bindent">4. Brit. Mus. 8946. Plut. C.L.
<small>XXII.</small> D. In the British Museum. It is carelessly
written, and contains 38 charts and sketches. Probably a copy of
R.A. 2. This manuscript was bought in London at Mr. Lloyd's sale,
some time before 1776, for half-a-guinea, and was subsequently
acquired by Sir Joseph Banks. In 1776 Banks employed the Revd.
Charles G. Woide, Chaplain of the Dutch Chapel at St. James's, to
translate it. Woide's translation was used by Captain Burney in
his work. About 1868 the late Mr. J. E. Calder published in the
<i>Tasmanian Times</i> the account of the discovery of Tasmania
taken from Burney.</p>
<p class="bindent">5. Amongst the hydrographical documents
belonging to the publishing firm of Van Keulen of Amsterdam,
there was formerly a manuscript copy of the Journal. It was
probably a copy agreeing with R.A. 2, and, it is said, bore
Tasman's signature. Mr. Swart printed the complete Journal from
this copy, 1854-59.</p>
<p class="bindent">6. Mr. Lauts mentions that a manuscript copy
of the Journal was bought by the bookseller Bom, of Amsterdam, in
1835.</p>

<h4>APPENDIX.<br>
<br>
<small>THE DISCOVERY OF TASMANIA</small></h4>
<p align="center"><small>FROM TASMAN'S JOURNAL,
1642.</small>*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Translated from Swart's edition of the
Journal, with notes, &amp;c., published at <i>Amsterdam</i> in
1860. A strictly literal translation has been preferred, as
giving a better idea of the quaintness of the original.[and see
Heeres, above.]]</p>
<p>23<small>RD NOVEMBER</small>.**&mdash;Good weather, and the
wind S.W., with a fresh gale. In the morning found that our
rudder-head was broken in two in the tiler-mortise; whereupon lay
to under shortened sail, and put a plank on either side. Noon
found our latitude 42&deg; 50', and longitude 162&deg; 51'.
Course, held E., and sailed 25 (100) miles. Here found one degree
north-westerly variation, which here decreases very rapidly.
According to our reckoning had the west side of <i>Nova
Guinea</i> to the north of us.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The days are reckoned from midnight to
midnight. The longitude is calculated from the meridian of the
<i>Peak of Teneriffe</i>.]</p>
<p>24th November.&mdash;Good weather and clear sky. Noon, found
latitude 42&deg; 25', and longitude 163&deg; 31'. Course kept E.
by N., and sailed 30 (120) miles. The wind from the S.W., and
afterwards S., with a gentle top-gallant breeze. Afternoon, about
4 o'clock, saw land. Had it E. by N. from us 10 (40) miles by our
reckoning. It was very high land. Towards evening saw in the
E.S.E. three high mountains, and in the N.E. also saw two
mountains, but not so high as those to the south. Here had a true
pointing compass. In the evening, in the first: glass when the
watch *** was set (8 <small>P.M</small>.), proposed to the
council of our ship with the under mates, whether it would not be
best to stand off the shore to sea; and required their opinion,
when they thought this to be most advisable. Whereupon
unanimously approved after 3 glasses (9.30 <small>P.M</small>.)
to lie out from the shore and run from it 10 glasses (5 hours),
when we should stand back to the land: all more fully appearing
in the resolution of this date to which we refer. At night, after
3 glasses (1&frac12; hours), the wind was S.E. Tacked from the
shore, and sounded in 100 fathoms, clean white fine sand with
small shells; afterwards sounded again, and had black coarse sand
with small stones. At night had the wind S.E. with gentle
breeze.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The first watch was from 8
<small>P.M</small>. to midnight. A half-hour sand-glass was used
to measure the time.]</p>
<p>25th November.&mdash;Morning, nearly calm. Hoisted the white
flag and the flag at the mizzen-top-gallant-mast, whereupon the
officers of the <i>Zeehan</i> with their mates came on board us,
when we called the council and resolved with them, as is to be
seen by the resolution of this day, and is there set out at
length, to which we here refer. Towards noon got the wind S.E.,
and afterwards S.S.E. and S. Tacked for the shore. In the
evening, about 5 o'clock, came under the shore. Three miles (12)
out from the shore had 60 fathoms, coral bottom; 1 mile out (4
miles) had clean, fine, white sand. Found this coast stretching
S. by E. and N. by W., a smooth [bare] coast, and had reached
latitude 42&deg; 30', and mean longitude 163&deg; 50'. Tacked
again from the shore. The wind blew S.S.E., top-gallant breeze.
When you come from the W. and find that you have 4&deg;
north-westerly variation, then you may look out for land, because
the variation here decreases very rapidly. If it happens that you
get rough weather from the westerly quarter, then you may well
lie to, and not sail ahead. Here, on the coast, you have a
compass pointing true. We have also the mean longitude, which we
determined by each working out his reckoning and taking the mean.
Wherefrom we find this land to be in the longitude of 163&deg;
50'.</p>
<p>The land is the first land in the <i>South Sea (Zuytzee</i>)
that we have met with, and is yet known by no European nations.
So we have given this land the name of <small>ANTHOONY VAN
DIEMENSLANDT</small>, in honour of the Most Honourable the
Governor-General, our High Master, who sent us out to make these
discoveries. The islands lying round about it, as many as are
known to us, we have named after the Honourable Members of the
Council of India, and may be seen on the small chart made
thereof.</p>
<p class="negindent">[Here there are in the manuscript some
sketches of land, of which two are found in
<small>VALENTYN</small>, p. 48, No. 1<small>A</small> and No.
5<small>E</small>. The other, No. 5<small>E</small>, I have not
found in the manuscript.&mdash;<small>JACOB SWART</small>.]</p>
<p>26th November.&mdash;Had the wind easterly, gentle breeze,
hazy weather, so that we could not see land. Reckoned we were
about 9&frac12; (38) miles from the shore. Towards noon, hoisted
the flag at the main-top-gallant-mast, whereupon the
<i>Zeehaen</i> immediately came up under our stern, when we
hailed her people that Sr. <small>GILSEMANS</small> should come
aboard. Whereupon the said <small>GILSEMANS</small>, without
delay, came on board us, and we made known to him the matters
which are mentioned in the under-written note, and are to be
taken with him to his ship, in order to show the same to the
Skipper, <small>GERRIT JANSZ</small>, and also for orders to
their mates.</p>
<p>"The officers of the fly-ship <i>Zeehaen</i> shall in their
daily log describe this land, which we saw yesterday and are now
near, as in longitude 163&deg; 50', because, by mutual reckoning,
we find it thus, and this longitude as settled&mdash;and begin to
reckon the longitude afresh from thence. He who before this has
longitude 160&deg; or more, shall now make his reckoning from
that land. This is therefore done in order to avoid all mistakes
as much as is in any way possible. The officers of the
<i>Zeehaen</i> shall give the same charge to the mates, and shall
also observe it, because we find this to be fitting; and the
charts which are hereafter made by any one shall lay down that
land in the mean longitude as before stated of 163&deg; 50'.</p>
<p>"Given on the <i>Heemskercq</i>, date as above.</p>
<p align="right">"(Undersigned) <small>ABEL JANSZ
TASMAN."</small></p>
<p>Noon, reckoned we were in S. latitude 43&deg; 36', and
longitude 163&deg; 2'. Course kept S.S.W., and sailed 18 (72)
miles. Had half a degree north-westerly variation. Got the wind
N.E. Set our course E.S.E.</p>
<p>27th November.&mdash;Morning, saw the coast again. Our course
was still E.S.E. Noon, reckoned we were in S. latitude 44&deg;
4', and longitude 164&deg; 2'. Course held S.E. by E., and sailed
13 (52) miles. It was drizzling, misty, hazy, and rainy weather;
the wind N.E. and N.N.E., with gentle breeze. At night, after 7
glasses in the first watch (11.30 <small>P.M</small>.), lay to
under shortened sail. We dared not sail on, by reason that it was
so dark.</p>
<p>28th November.&mdash;Morning, still cloudy, misty, rainy,
weather. Made sail again. Set our course E., and afterwards N.E.
by N. Saw land N.E. and N.N.E. from us, and stood straight for
it. The coast here stretches S.E. by E. and N.W. by W. This land
runs away here to the east, so far as I can observe. Noon, by
reckoning in latitude 44&deg; 12', and longitude 165&deg; 2'; and
course held E. by S., and sailed 11 (44) miles. The wind from the
N.W., with gentle breeze. In the evening came under the shore.
There are under the shore some small islands, one of which looks
like a lion. This lies about 3 (12) miles out to sea from the
mainland. Evening, got the wind E. At night, lay to under
shortened sail.</p>
<p>29th November.&mdash;Morning, were still near the rock which
looks like a lion's head.* Had the wind westerly, with
top-gallant breeze. Sailed along the coast, which here stretches
east and west. Towards noon passed two rocks, the most westerly
looking like <i>Pedra Branca</i>, which lies on the coast of
<i>China</i>; the most easterly, looking like a high rugged
tower, lies about 4 (16) miles out from the mainland. Ran through
between these rocks and the land. Noon, reckoned we were in
latitude 43&deg; 53', longitude 166&deg; 3'. Course held E.N.E.,
and sailed 12 (48) miles. Still sailed along the shore. In the
evening, about 5 o'clock, came before a bay.** It seemed that we
would likely find a good anchorage there. Wherefore resolved with
our ships' council to run into it, as appears by the said
resolution. Were almost in the bay when there presently arose
such a violent wind that we were obliged to take in our sails and
run back to sea under shortened sail, because it was impossible,
with such a wind,' to come to an anchor. In the evening resolved
to stand out to sea for the night under shortened sail that we
might not fall on a lee shore in such a storm. All which is to be
seen more at large in the above-mentioned resolution, whereto (to
avoid prolixity) we here refer.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The <i>Mewstone</i>.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Storm Bay</i>, or, rather, <i>Adventure
Bay</i>.]</p>
<p>Ultimo November.&mdash;Morning, at dawn, tacked to the shore.
Had been driven off from the shore so far by wind and current
that we could scarcely see land. Did our best to approach it
again. Noon, had land N.W. from us; tacked to the west, the wind
northerly, but not serving us to fetch the land. Noon, found
latitude 43&deg; 41', longitude 168&deg; 3'. Course held E. by
N., and sailed 20 (80) miles, with stormy and unsettled weather.
Here the compass showed true. A little after noon tacked to the
west, with hard unsteady breeze. Tacked to the north under
shortened sail.</p>
<p>Primo December.&mdash;Morning, weather somewhat more moderate.
Set our topsails; the wind W.S.W., with top-gallant breeze.
Steered our course for the shore. Noon, found latitude 43&deg;
10', and longitude 167&deg; 55'. Course held N.N.W., and sailed 8
(32) miles, and was almost calm. At noon, hoisted the white flag,
whereupon our friends of the <i>Zeehaen</i> came on board, when
we resolved together that it would be best and most expedient, if
wind and weather but permitted, to get on land, the sooner the
better, so as to obtain a nearer knowledge of its situation, and
also to see what refreshments were to be had, as the resolution
of to-day shows more at large. Afterwards got a little breeze
from the eastward. Ran towards the shore to examine whether some
good anchorage can be got hereabouts. About an hour after sunset
let go the anchor in a good harbour, in 22 fathoms, between white
and grey fine sand, good holding ground; for which we must show
thankful hearts to Almighty God.</p>

<p>2nd December.&mdash;Early in the morning sent the Pilot-Major
<small>FRANCOY JACOBSZ</small>, with our long-boat
(<i>chaloup</i>), with 4 musketeers and 6 rowers, every one
provided with a pike and sidearms, together with the launch
(<i>praeutien, sloep</i>) of the <i>Zeehaen</i>, and one of their
second mates and 6 musketeers, to an inlet (<i>inwijck</i>), which was
situated fully a long mile (<i>i.e</i>., over 4 miles) north-west
of us, in order to see what useful things&mdash;such as fresh
water, refreshments, timber, and other things&mdash;might be
obtainable there. About 3 hours before evening our boats
returned, bringing various samples of vegetables, which they had
seen growing in abundance, some not unlike certain herbs which
grow at the <i>Cabo de Bona Esperance</i> (<i>Cape of Good
Hope</i>), and are fit for use as pot herbs. Others were long and
saltish, which have no ill-likeness to sea-parsley. The
Pilot-Major and the second-mate of the <i>Zeehaen</i> reported
what follows, namely:&mdash;</p>
<p>That they had rowed above a mile (4 miles) to the said point,
where they had found high out level land with herbs (not planted,
but springing from God and nature), fruitful timber in plenty,
and a running watering-place, and many open valleys; which water
was good indeed, but very troublesome to draw, and running so
slowly that it could only be taken out with a bowl.</p>
<p>That they had heard some sound of people; also a playing
nearly like a trumpet or small gom [gong], which was not far from
them, but they had not got to see anyone.</p>
<p>That they had seen two trees about 2 to 2&frac12; fathoms
thick, 60 to 65 feet high below the branches, which trees had
been hacked into with flints, and the bark peeled off in the form
of steps (in order to climb up thereby and take birds' nests),
each being full 5 feet from the other. So that they presumed that
there were very tall men here, or that they must know how to
climb the said trees by some device. In one tree these cut steps
seemed so fresh and green as if not four days had passed since
they had been hewn.</p>
<p>That they had observed in the earth footprints or scratchings
of some beasts, not ill-resembling the claws of a tiger. They
also brought on board some dung of four-footed beasts (as they
presumed and could observe), besides a little gum, fine in
appearance, which drops out of the trees, and has a resemblance
to gumlac (<i>gomma lacca</i>). That about the east point of this
bay, having sounded at high-water, they had found 13 to 14 feet;
the ebb and flood there about 3 feet.</p>
<p>That in the entrance of the said point they had seen a
multitude of gulls, wild ducks, and geese, but none landward;
though they had indeed heard the noise of them; and had observed
no fish, but divers mussels sticking in sundry places on
bushes.</p>
<p>That the country is generally occupied with trees, which stand
so thinly scattered that you may pass through everywhere and see
to a far distance; so that you could always get sight of people
or wild beast in the country, as it is unencumbered by thick wood
or underwood; which should give great facility for the exploring
of the country.</p>
<p>That in various places in the interior they had seen many
trees which had been deeply burnt into above their roots. The
earth was here and there beaten down and burnt as hard as stones
by the lighting of fires on it.</p>
<p>A little before our boats (which were coming on board) got
within sight, we saw at times a thick smoke rising on the land,
which lay about W. by N. from us. We therefore presumed that our
people were doing it for a signal, because they were delayed so
long in returning; for they had their orders to come back to us
with speed, partly in order to inform us of their discoveries, or
otherwise, if they saw there was nothing useful there, that they
might go to examine other places, so that no time should be spent
uselessly. Our people having come on board we asked them whether
they had been thereabouts and had lighted fires, whereupon they
replied that they had not, but that at divers times and places in
the woods they also had seen smokes; so that without doubt there
must be men in this place, and these of an uncommon stature.</p>
<p>To-day, had much variable wind from the eastward, but the most
of the day a stiff steady gale from the S.E.</p>
<p>3rd December.&mdash;To-day we went with the Merchant
<small>GILSEMANS</small> and our boats, as yesterday, with
musketeers, the rowers being provided with pikes and side arms,
to the S.E. side of this bay, where we found water, but the land
so low that the fresh water was made brackish and salt through
the breaking of the sea, and the ground was too rocky to sink
wells. Therefore, returned on board, summoned the council of our
two ships, with whom we resolved and found to be good, as is
shown by the resolution of this date, where it is to be seen at
length and is set forth; whereto for brevity's sake we here
refer. Afternoon, we went with the said boats, together with the
Pilot-Major <small>FRANCOYS JACOBSZ</small>, the Skipper
<small>GERRIT JANSZ ISACK GILSEMANS</small>, Merchant of the
<i>Zeehaen</i>, the Junior Merchant <small>ABRAHAM
COOMANS</small>, and our Chief <small>CARPENTER PIETER
JACOBSZ</small>, to the S.E. corner of this bay, having with us a
pole with the Company's mark cut therein, and the Prince's flag,
in order to set the same up there, so that it may be evident to
posterity that we have been here and taken the said land for a
possession and property. Having rowed with our boats about half
way, it began to blow hard and the sea to rise so high that the
launch of the <i>Zeehaen</i>, in which were the Pilot-Major and
Sr. <small>GILSEMANS</small>, was obliged to return on board. We
went on with our long-boat (<i>chaloup</i>), coming close under
the shore into a little bay which lay W.S.W. from the ships. The
surf broke at such a rate that the land could not be approached
without danger of the boat being dashed in pieces. We ordered the
said carpenter to swim ashore by himself with the pole and
Prince's flag, and remained with the long-boat lying to the wind.
We made him set up the said pole with the flag at the top in the
earth before a decaying tree, the lowest one of a group of four
noticeable high trees standing in the form of a crescent about
the middle of this bay. This tree is burnt just above the foot,
and is indeed the tallest of the other three,* though it appears
to be not so high, since it stands on the declivity of the
cluster. It has at the top above its crown two high dry branches
sticking out, so uniformly set about with dry twigs and
branchlets that it looks like the great horns of a stag.
Moreover, on the undermost side there stands a very green and
round well-crowned branch, the shoots of which, by their even
proportion, made the said tree very elegant and like the top of a
larding pin. After the head carpenter had accomplished the matter
above rehearsed, in view of me, <small>ABEL JANSZ TASMAN</small>,
the Skipper <small>GERRIT JANSZ</small>, and the Junior Merchant
<small>ABRAHAM COOMANS</small>, we rowed the boat as near to the
shore as we dared venture, and the said carpenter swam back again
to the long-boat through the surf; when after accomplishing this
matter, we rowed bark again on board, leaving the above-mentioned
as a memorial to posterity and to the inhabitants of this
country, who did not show themselves, although we suspected that
some of them were not far from there, and kept watchful eyes on
our proceedings.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Sic</i> in original.]</p>
<p>We did not look for herbs, for, on account of the roughness of
the sea, no one could reach the shore, save by swimming, so that
it was impossible to bring anything to the long-boat. All day the
wind was mostly northerly. In the evening took observation of the
sun, and found 3&deg; N.E. variation. With sunset got a strong
north wind, which rapidly increased to so violent a storm from
the N.N.W. that we were constrained to strike both yards and to
let go our bower anchor.</p>
<p>4th December.&mdash;With the dawning of day the storm abated.
The weather moderate, and the wind being off shore W. by N. Hove
in the bower anchor again. The said anchor being hove up and got
above water, saw that both flukes were so far gone that we got
home nothing but the bare shaft. Weighed the other anchor also,
and got under sail, in order to sail to the north between the
most northerly islands, and to seek a more convenient
watering-place. We have lain at anchor here in S. lat. 43&deg;,
long. 167&frac12;&deg;. Before noon the wind westerly. At noon
found lat. 42&deg; 40', long. 168&deg;. Course held N.E., and
sailed 8 (32) miles. Afternoon, the wind N.W. The whole day very
variable winds. In the evening again had W.N.W. with strong wind,
W. by N., and W.N.W. Tacked about to the northward. In the
evening saw a round mountain N.N.W. of us about 8 (32) miles.
Course close hauled by the wind northwards. In sailing out of
this bay, and also the whole day through, saw away along the
coast much smoke rising from fires. We should here describe the
trend of the coast and of the neighbouring islands, but excuse
the same in order to be brief, referring to the small chart that
has been made of it, and is subjoined herewith.</p>
<p>[Here is probably meant the chart of which mention made in the
conclusion of this Journal for 1st December.&mdash;<small>JACOB
SWART</small>.]</p>
<p>5th December.&mdash;In the morning the wind N.W. by W. Still
made our course as before. The high round mountain which we had
seen the day before bore due W. of us 6 (24) miles, from whence
the land falls off to the N.W., so that we could no longer hold
the land on board, because the wind was almost ahead. Wherefore
we summoned the Council and second mates, who proposed, and it
was therewith resolved&mdash;the officers of the <i>Zeehaen</i>
having been spoken&mdash;to set our course due east, according to
the resolution of the 11th ulto., and to run on this course
<i>Salomonis Islands</i>, as may be more fully seen by the until
we reach the longitude of 195&deg;, or that of the resolution of
this date. Noon, reckoned lat. 41&deg; 34', long. 169&deg;.
Course held N.E. by N., and sailed 20 (80) miles. Set our course
due east, in order to make further discoveries, and also in order
not to fall into the variable winds between the trades and
counter-trades. The wind N.W., fresh gale. At night the wind W.,
strong fresh gale and good clear weather.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON THE ABORIGINES OF TASMANIA, EXTRACTED FROM THE
MANUSCRIPT JOURNALS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON WALKER, WITH AN
INTRODUCTION BY JAMES B. WALKER, F.R.G.S.</h3>
<p><small>IN</small> the year 1832 Messrs. James Backhouse and
George Washington Walker, two members of the Society of Friends,
arrived at Hobart from England. The objects of their visit to the
Australian Colonies were philanthropic. One purpose they had in
view was an investigation of the condition of the prisoner
population and the working of the penal system. Another was an
enquiry into the treatment of the Aboriginal inhabitants. The
various Governors afforded them every facility in their
enquiries, and the reports which they made from time to time had
a considerable influence in obtaining an amelioration of the
condition of the large number of men then under penal
discipline.</p>
<p>In October, 1832, (just 65 years ago), they paid a visit to
the aboriginal establishment at Flinders Island. Mr. Backhouse
was an accomplished naturalist, a keen and accurate observer, and
rendered good service to science by by his contributions to the
Botany of Tasmania; and his "Narrative of a Visit to the
Australian Colonies", (London, 1843), has given an account of the
visit to Flinders Island, and has preserved a mass of information
respecting the aborigines and their habits, which forms a
valuable addition to our very limited knowledge of this extinct
race. On examining Mr. Walker's MS. Journal, which is in my
possession, I found a vocabulary of native words and also some
songs, which have never been printed. The relics of the native
language are so few, that this list of Words, taken down from the
lips of the natives, has a distinct value; more especially so as
it precedes by nearly fifteen years Dr. Milligan's well-known and
more extensive vocabulary, which was complied many years after
the blacks had come under European influences. In submitting
these fragments to the Royal Society it seemed desirable to take
the opportunity of collecting Mr. Walker's observations on the
aborigines, although part has already been published in his
Memoirs. (London, 1862). The accounts of the race are so meagre
that even the smallest reliable details respecting it recorded by
an independent observer will have a value for
anthropologists.</p>
<p>The deadly feud between the natives and the settlers which
raged between 1825 and 1830, led to Governor Arthur's military
operation known as the "Black Line". In October, 1830, some 3000
men took the field, to sweep the island from north to south, with
the view of converging on the Oyster Bay and Big River tribes,
and driving them into the <i>cul de sac</i> of Tasman's
Peninsula. The march commenced on 7th October, 1830, and the line
advanced southwards. But the blacks easily slipped through its
straggling ranks, and when on 26th November it closed on East Bay
Neck it was found that the prey had escaped. The total result of
this levy en masse, at a cost of &pound;30,000, was the capture
of one solitary aborigine. Some months later it was discovered
that the supposed formidable force opposed to the 3000 men of the
line was considerably less than a hundred naked savages.</p>
<p>Consequent on the failure of Arthur's Military Movements,
efforts were made to capture, either by persuasion or force, the
"mobs" scattered over the Island with the view of removing them
to a place of safely, where they would be under the care and
protection of the Government, and powerless to molest the
settlers further. By the end of 1830 some 56 had been captured.
They were placed temporarily on Swan Island, in Bass Strait. This
was only a desolate granite rock, and the blacks were soon
removed to Gun Carriage, or Vansittart Island. This also proving
unsuitable, they were finally transferred in 1831 to Flinders
Island. As George Augustus Robinson, in his daring mission of
conciliation, accomplished what the whole force of the colony had
failed in, and persuaded other "mobs" to surrender themselves,
fresh captives were continually transported to the new
settlement. For 15 years Flinders was the home of the miserable
remnant of the native tribes of Tasmania, and for the greater
part of them it was destined to become their grave.</p>
<p>Messrs. Backhouse and Walker visited the settlement in the
spring of 1832 (October), a few months after the blacks had been
transported thither, and it is from a report made by them to
Governor Arthur, at his request, and from the MS. journal of Mr.
Walker, that I have gleaned a few particulars respecting the
aborigines as they appeared when undergoing the process of
civilisation on Flinders Island.</p>
<p>It was in September, 1832, that the friends sailed from Hobart
in the Government cutter <i>Charlotte</i>, placed at their
disposal by Governor Arthur. The vessel touched at Port Arthur,
which had been established two years before as a penal station,
and then proceeded on her voyage to Flinders Island. After
running considerable risk of shipwreck in the dangerous
navigation of the Straits, the <i>Charlotte</i> anchored under
Green Island, and a boat took the visitors to the Aboriginal
Station, three miles off, at "The Lagoons". They say: "Though,
according to their usual custom towards strangers, they at first
seemed scarcely to notice us, yet, when spoken to by the
Commandant, their cheerful countenances, hearty laughs, and
good-natured manners, produced an agreeable impression." The
visitors noted (perhaps with surprise) that "their countenances
exhibited none of that marked ferocity which has been ascribed to
them." Further observation strengthened the first impression, and
they came to the conclusion that the Tasmanian aborigines
deserved the character of a good-tempered race.</p>
<p>There were at this time at the settlement 78 natives in
all&mdash;44 men, 29 women, and only 5 children. They looked
plump and healthy, notwithstanding that they had been suffering
from shortness of provisions. The arrangements for supplies had
been shamefully deficient. The white people had for some time
been living on oatmeal and potatoes, which were far from good.
The blacks, who abhorred oatmeal, lived on potatoes and rice.
Fortunately mutton-birds (<i>Nectris brevicaudus</i>)
supplemented their scanty provision. A little while before, when
left in charge of Surgeon M'Lachlan on desolate Gun Carriage, if
it had not been for some potatoes they obtained from the sealers,
the unfortunate blacks would have been actually starved.</p>
<p>The site of the settlement at "The Lagoons" was most
unsuitable. It was a narrow sandbank, running parallel with the
shore, and producing nothing but fern and scrub. It was bounded
on one side by the sea, and on the other side by a salt lagoon
bordered with thick ti-tree, and cutting off access to the
main.</p>
<p>When first placed on the islands the blacks had been put under
the charge of most unsuitable officers&mdash;ignorant men, quite
unfit for the difficult and delicate task of managing savages
fresh from their native forests. It was not therefore strange
that at first there was much disorder, and that quarrels between
members of different tribes were of frequent occurrence. At this
time, however, they were under the care of a commandant, who
threw himself into the work before him with an unselfish
enthusiasm. The commandant was Lieutenant William J. Darling, a
young officer of the 63rd Regiment, a brother of Sir Charles
Darling, who was afterwards (1863-66) Governor of Victoria. He
was ably seconded by the surgeon, Archibald M'Lachlan. The
self-denying exertions of these two officers for the welfare of
the poor blacks cannot be too highly praised. To promote their
advancement in civilisation the Commandant and Surgeon spared no
pains. They treated them with uniform and patient kindness and
consideration. They seldom sat down to breakfast or tea in their
own little weatherboard huts without having some aborigines as
guests, with the view of exciting in them a desire for
improvement in civilisation.</p>
<p>Yet the arrangements for the aborigines, well meant as they
undoubtedly were, seem to have been singularly injudicious. They
were lodged at night in shelters or "breakwinds". These
"breakwinds" were thatched roofs sloping to the ground, with an
opening at the top to let out the smoke, and closed at the ends,
with the exception of a doorway. They were twenty feet long by
ten feet wide. In each of these from twenty to thirty blacks were
lodged. The fires were made along the centre of the breakwind,
and the people squatted or lay on the ground around them.
Blankets were provided for them to sleep in. To savages
accustomed to sleep naked in the open air beneath the rudest
shelter, the change to close and heated dwellings tended to make
them susceptible, as they had never been in their wild state, to
chills from atmospheric changes, and was only too well calculated
to induce those severe pulmonary diseases which were destined to
prove so fatal to them.</p>
<p>The same may be said of the use of clothes. In their wild
state the blacks had gone entirely naked in all weathers,
protecting their bodies against the elements by rubbing them with
grease. At the settlement they were compelled to wear clothes,
which they threw off when heated or when they found them
troublesome, and when wetted by rain, allowed them to dry on
their bodies. In the case of the Tasmanians, as with other wild
tribes accustomed to go naked, the use of clothes had a most
mischievous effect on their health. In their native bush the
constant and strenuous exertion which they were compelled to make
in hunting wild animals for necessary food kept them hardy and
healthy. Cooped up in the settlement and regularly fed, they lost
the motive for exertion, and sank into a life of listless
inaction, in which they lost their natural vigour, and became an
easy prey to any disease that attacked them.</p>
<p>Mr. R. H. Davies, who has given us one of the most reliable of
all the accounts of the aborigines, remarks that in spite of them
having been treated with uniform kindness in their captivity,
their numbers rapidly decreased; the births were very few, and
the deaths numerous. "This", says he, "may have been in great
measure owing to their change of living and food, but much more
to their banishment from the mainland of Van Diemen's Land, which
is visible from Flinders Island; and the natives have often
pointed it out to me with an expression of the deepest sorrow
depicted on their countenances." In fact, the unhappy captives
pined and died from "home sickness".</p>
<p>How to treat the poor remnant of the native tribes was a
difficulty, perhaps an insoluble problem under the circumstances.
If they could have been left in possession of a portion of their
ancient hunting-grounds&mdash;a reserve to which they could have
been confined&mdash;they might have lived healthily and even
happily for a long period of years, though even that would not
have averted the final doom. But the feud between the two races
had been too deadly to permit of their being left in proximity,
and the seclusion of an island was imperative, as much for the
protection of the blacks as for the safety of the whites.</p>
<p>To the credit of the authorities, it must be said that from
the time Lieut. Darling took charge in 1832 every possible effort
was made to secure the well-being of the few survivors of the
native tribes. They were well supplied with food, and they
supplemented the ordinary supplies by taking mutton-birds and
their eggs, and, while the game lasted, by occasional hunting
excursions. Tea and potatoes were their favourite diet. Of tea
highly sweetened they seemed to be able to drink any quantity.
Milk they grew very fond of. Mutton and beef they preferred to
salt meat, and even to kangaroo; but such rare luxuries they
seldom had the opportunity of enjoying. Their appetites were
enormous. Davies states that a native woman at the settlement was
one day watched by an officer, and seen to eat between fifty and
sixty mutton-bird eggs&mdash;as large as those of a
duck&mdash;besides a double allowance of bread. "Whether this
story is true or not, I do not venture an opinion. But it is well
known that the Australian native, like other savages accustomed
to long compulsory fasts, has a boaconstrictor-like power of
gorging himself far beyond the extreme capacity of a
European.</p>
<p>The blacks on Flinders also developed an extreme fondness for
tobacco. When not occupied in cooking or in hunting they were
rarely without a pipe. One pipe was made to serve several. After
the husband had taken a few whiffs it was passed to the wife, and
then to others. If a stranger was present, nothing would please
them more than he also should take a whiff from the pipe.</p>
<p>The care of the authorities extended far beyond ensuring them
plentiful food. No exertion was spared to drill these children of
nature into the habits of a civilisation unto which they were not
born. If not apt, they were certainly docile pupils. Their good
humour, which, struck the French voyages as remarkable, is
constantly referred to by the Friends. They say: "The
opportunities we have had of forming an estimate of the
aboriginal character have strongly impressed us with the opinion
that they are not naturally a treacherous and ferocious nor a
vindictive people. Their uniform cheerfulness and agreeableness
of manner forbid the idea of inherent ferocity. The treachery and
outrages they have experienced at the hands of Europeans excited
at one time a spirit of revenge, under the influence of which
retaliation was made on some of the innocent people of Van
Diemen's Land as well as on the guilty, a thing not uncommon even
in what are termed civilised wars. Some of those on the
Settlement, who are known to have taken a part in avenging the
wrongs of their countrymen, have since proved themselves to be
men of kind and affectionate dispositions, and have won the
return of the same kindly feelings which they have shown in their
intercourse with each other."</p>
<p>Instances of their good-natured readiness to please are
related by the Friends. One woman, on the visitors expressing a
wish to have a sample of the inside of the fern-tree, which was
an article of ordinary food with the blacks, made a journey of
some miles into the bush to procure it. Another collected a
considerable quantity of fern root, and prepared it in the native
manner, because one of the visitors had desired to see it in the
state in which the blacks were accustomed to eat it. In their
intercourse with each other they showed a like good nature. The
Friends noticed that in the daily distribution of food, though
the division was often very unequal, there was no dissatisfaction
because one got more than another. They showed the most perfect
good temper throughout.</p>
<p>The absence of disturbances or crimes of violence during their
captivity on Flinders Island is of itself a sufficient proof
that the idea, so commonly entertained at the time, of their
untamable ferocity, was not well founded. Yet, the Aborigines
Committee, in 1830, in their Report to the Governor, stated their
belief "that the Aborigines of this Colony are insensible to
kindness, devoid of generous feelings, bent on revenge."</p>
<p>The tractability of the captive blacks at the Settlement was
remarkable. They acted like good-natured children, and were as
imitative as monkeys. Thus, at a religious service, at which some
of them were present, they behaved with great decorum, and during
prayer turned their faces to the wall in imitation of the whites.
When they were presented with Scotch caps the young men drew
themselves up in a line and imitated the manoeuvres of soldiers.
They showed a great desire to copy the ways of their white
instructors. The men were particularly anxious to be supplied
with trousers, but resented the offer of yellow trousers, the
usual garb of prisoners. They also wanted to have stools to sit
upon, and tables for their meals, and to be supplied with knives
and forks, like Europeans.</p>
<p>Some of the women learned to make bread, to wash clothes, and
to sew, and to use soap and water daily.</p>
<p>The Friends remark: "The scrupulous care they evince not to
take anything that does not belong to them entitles them to the
character of honesty. They are observing, and have retentive
memories, affording very sufficient proofs that they are not
deficient in intellect. Among other traits, we remarked less
indisposition to personal exertion than is usually attributed to
savages. The willingness and promptitude with which they perform
little services for those whom they consider their friends, as in
bringing wood and water for daily use, show that they are not of
a sluggish disposition when there is a sufficient inducement to
labour. . . In the morning, daily, they may be seen walking in
procession, each bearing a lode of wood on his shoulder, which is
cheerfully deposited in the proper place. They are said to have
taken great pleasure in cutting and bringing in the wattles and
grass for building and thatching; also in fencing, breaking up,
and planting with potatoes the acre and a half of ground in front
of their cottages [at Wybalenna]. The latter was accomplished
almost entirely by their own unassisted efforts . . . They will
generally do anything they are required to do that is reasonable.
It is kind treatment that ensures its performance."</p>
<p>They showed all the usual improvidence of savages. Though they
were finally led to take care of their tin plates and eating
utensils and to keep them clean, it was at first difficult to
prevent them throwing away these articles. They had been
accustomed to a mutton-fish shell, or something as simple, as a
drinking vessel, and could not understand the necessity of taking
care of things adapted for permanent use. In hunting, they
destroyed the game recklessly, and could not be restrained from
killing the kangaroo as long as their dogs would run. On an
adjoining island, where there were large numbers of wallaby, the
blacks, in three or four hunting excursions, killed over a
thousand head. By this kind of wholesale destruction, kangaroo,
once very abundant in the neighbourhood of the Flinders
Settlement, soon became extremely scarce.</p>
<p>The Commandant found the greatest difficulty in inducing them
to save the wallaby skins, it being the custom to throw the
wallaby on the fire and singe off the fur. He explained to them
the value of the skins, and the articles they could get in
exchange. He gave presents to those who brought in skins; but it
seemed impossible to teach them any idea of barter, or, indeed,
to get them to look beyond the immediate moment.</p>
<p>In January, 1834, Messrs. Backhouse and Walker again visited
Flinders Island at the request of Governor Arthur. They found the
blacks removed to a place called by the sealers Pea Jacket Point,
then rechristened "Civilisation Point". about fifteen miles north
of their old location. The village was named "Wybalenna",
signifying, in the language of the Ben Lomond tribe, "Blackman's
Houses". There were at this time 111 aborigines on the
island&mdash;55 males and 56 females. Of the whole number only 16
were children. Wybalenna was a much better location than The
Lagoons. There was sufficient water, good pasturage, and land fit
for cultivation as gardens. The officers of the establishment had
weatherboard houses, and about twenty thatched wattle and plaster
huts had been built for the blacks.</p>
<p>The visitors found that in two years the aborigines showed
progress in at least the outward appearance of civilisation. They
now had a regular instructor or catechist, who tried to instil
into their minds some ideas of religion. To aid in this work he
had attempted a translation of the first three chapters of
Genesis into the language of the Ben Lomond tribe! The worthy
catechist's version is obviously worthless from a linguistic
point of view, whatever effect it may have had on the native mind
in other ways.</p>
<p>The catechist made most persevering efforts to instruct the
blacks, and even succeeded in teaching some of the boys and
younger men to read a little.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* In 1834 five or six of the boys were removed
from Flinders Island and placed in the Government Orphan School
at New Town, near Hobart. It is stated that some of them showed
very fair intelligence. Mr. Walker mentions that two lads (Arthur
and Friday) who in 1832 were sunk in the barbarous habits of
their race, showed considerable improvement after two years'
instruction at the Orphan School. One of them&mdash;George Walter
Arthur&mdash;had not only learnt to read fairly well, but also
wrote a hand which would not have disgraced a European youth of
the same age. The master of the school informed Mr. Walker that,
with some exceptions, the aboriginal children were not inferior
in capacity to the European children in his charge.]</p>
<p>At the time of the Friends' visit to the Flinders Settlement
in 1834, the health of the surviving aborigines was good. A great
mortality had occurred in the rainy season of the preceding year,
chiefly among the men from the West Coast tribes, who had been
the shortest time on the island. Between 1st January and 31st
December, 1833, out of some 140 at the Settlement, 31 had died:
of these, sixteen belonged to the West Coast tribes. Most of the
deaths resulted from sudden and acute affections of the
chest&mdash;pneumonia or phthisis. This kind of disease appears
to have often made great havoc among them when at large in their
own country. In the previous winter it had been more fatal among
the few aborigines at large on the West Coast than amongst those
at the Settlement on Flinders. It was proposed, as likely to
conduce to the better health of the natives, that they should
wear shoes!</p>
<p>Thus far I have followed Mr. Walker's account. The rest of the
brief and melancholy history of the remnant of the Tasmanian
aborigines is soon told.</p>
<p>In 1835, George Augustus Robinson, who had just completed his
mission by bringing in the last party of wanderers, was sent by
the Governor to take charge of the Flinders establishment. In a
speech which he made at Sydney some few years later, he gave a
long account of his administration. He boasted that his efforts
to lead forward the blacks in the scale of civilisation had met
with flattering success. Their minds were beginning to expand. In
their intercourse with each other they were affable and
courteous. They were placed under no restraint, but enjoyed the
fullest degree of personal freedom. They were instructed in the
Christian religion. Two services were held on Sunday, and others
during the week. The services were conducted in English, which
the natives well understood. Attendance was voluntary, yet all
attended. He had established schools&mdash;a day-school for boys,
a day-school for girls, an evening-school, and a Sunday-school.
Periodical examinations were held, from which it appeared that
the youths were able to answer questions in the leading events of
Scripture, in Christian doctrine, arithmetic, geography, and
several points of general information. Some of them could write
very fairly. The girls were taught sewing and knitting, and could
make clothes. The people had neat cottages and gardens, and
conformed in every respect to European habits. He had formed an
aboriginal police, and a court composed of himself and three
chiefs, who acted as constables. He had established a circulating
medium, and also a market to which the natives brought their
produce. The men had in three years cleared a considerable area
of ground, and had made a road nine miles long into the interior
of the island. He concludes with the remark, "The only drawback
on the establishment is the great mortality among them; but those
who survive are happy, contented, and useful members of
society."</p>
<p>A significant comment on his "flattering success!" While
Robinson and others were doing their best to make them into a
civilised people, the poor blacks had given up the struggle, and
were solving the difficult problem by dying. The very efforts
made for their welfare only served to hasten their inevitable
doom. The white man's civilisation proved scarcely less fatal to
them than the white man's musket. Yet it would be wrong to
estimate lightly the disinterested labours of the men who
perseveringly worked for the fading race. Amongst these men the
name of Mr. Robert Clark, the catechist, stands first. From the
time of his appointment to Flinders Island in 1834 to his death
in 1850 this estimable man gave himself with an absolute devotion
to the care of the unhappy remnant of the captive tribes. The
poor blacks on their part showed that they were not "insensible
to kindness, or devoid of generous feelings." While Mr Clark
lived they regarded him with a touching love and veneration. When
he died, after sixteen years spent in their service, they mourned
him as their one true and constant friend, and to the last the
miserable remnant of Tasmania's native tribes affectionately
cherished the memory of their beloved "Father Clark".</p>
<p>In 1838 the aborigines on Flinders, probably at the suggestion
of Robinson, who had been appointed Protector of the Aborigines
in Port Phillip, petitioned Governor Franklin to be removed to
that colony. The Home Authorities interposed and forbade the
removal. On Robinson's departure from Flinders, Captain Smith,
and afterwards Mr. Fisher, took charge of the Settlement. In 1842
Dr. Jeannerett received the appointment of Commandant from Sir
John Franklin. Five years later, in 1847, there remained only 44
individuals, viz., 12 men. 22 women, and ten children from 4 to
17 years of age. Some of the children were half-castes.</p>
<p>In the face of considerable opposition from the colonists, the
Government resolved to remove the few survivors to Oyster Cove,
in D'Entrecasteaux Channel. Dr. James Milligan was appointed
superintendent, and under his care the transfer was effected.
Among the children thus removed was Fanny Cochrane (now Mrs.
Fanny Smith), who is still living on her farm at Port Cygnet, the
sole survivor of the Flinders Island settlement. At Oyster Cove
the blacks rapidly deteriorated A new phase of civilisation was
here presented to them in the shape of low whites and rum. The
mortality was accelerated by the drunken habits into which many
of them fell. A few lingered on&mdash;a disgraced and degraded
remnant. In 1854 there remained only three men, eleven women, and
two children&mdash;sixteen in all. In 1865, Billy Lann&eacute;,
the last male aborigine, died, and only four women remained.
Truganini, the last survivor of her race, died in 1877.</p>
<p>Such is the melancholy history of the native inhabitants of
Tasmania.</p>

<h4>NOTES FROM MR. WALKER'S JOURNAL.</h4>
<p>The Aborigines of Van Diemen's Land are rather below the
average stature of Englishmen. Both sexes are stout, and their
limbs well proportioned; a few incline to corpulency. They walk
remarkably erect, assuming a dignified mien, and in all their
movements exhibit agility and ease. Their complexion is very
dark, almost black; a few are of lighter hue, approaching to the
colour of copper. The soles of their feet are as light as those
of Europeans who go without shoes. The palms of their hands are
also much lighter than their bodies. There is a considerable
variety of features among them. Generally, thick lips and flat
distended nostrils, are the characterists of the race. Many of
their countenances are pleasing, and very few of them forbidding;
one man, with a black beard and moustache, had a countenance
strikingly Jewish. Their hair is uniformly black and woolly, like
the African negroes, whom, in many respects, they nearly
resemble. In their savage state the men let their hair grow, and
ornament it with grease and red ochre, or, as they term it,
<i>balldowinny</i>. The women shave their heads. Neither sex wear
any clothing, unless a few strips of fur, which are sometimes
tied round the thickest part of their limbs, can be called such.
Both sexes wear strings of shells as necklaces. The shells are of
spiral form, varying in size from that of a pea to a horse-bean.
In their natural state they are not remarkable for beauty, but
when the outer coating is stripped off they show varied colours
of considerable brilliancy. The aborigines prepare them for use
by burning grass over wood embers, when the action of the
pyroligneous acid removes the thin coating from the shell. Some
of their necklaces were formed of kangaroo sinews, one twisted
round another so as to resemble braid, and then dyed with red
ochre, their favourite colour, and hung in several folds round
the neck. They are fond of smearing their bodies with grease and
red ochre, which enables them to bear with more ease the exposure
to the weather. They make incisions in their flesh, particularly
on the thighs, arms, and breasts. This is done with a sharp
flint, so as generally to form longitudinal lines parallel to
each other. The wounds are kept open by artificial means until
proud flesh is formed, and a lasting protuberant scar produced.
These marks are rendered more numerous by a custom which prevails
among them of lacerating any part of their bodies affected with
pain. This they suppose to be productive of relief. The bones of
deceased relatives, which some of them wear about them as tokens
of remembrance, are frequently tied on the affected limb for the
same purpose. Roomeh-tymyenna, the wife of a chief, carries
constantly on her bosom the skull of an infant. They connect some
superstitious notions with the practice, evidently regarding it
in the light of a charm.</p>
<p>As soon as it was dark, on the evening of our arrival,
preparations were made for a <i>corrobberry</i>, or dance, for
joy at the arrival of the cutter. The men strip off their
clothes, but the women, who occasionally join in the dance, make
no alteration in their adopted dress. A fire of sticks, or boughs
that make a lively blaze, was made, around which the men formed a
circle, and began a kind of song or chant, consisting of
expressions frequently repeated, and uttered in a drawling
monotone. The subjects of these songs are various; sometimes the
pursuits of hunting, and the enumeration of the animals that
become a prey to their dexterity; at other times the feats of
war, and their sanguinary conflicts with adverse tribes. A very
common description relates to the habits of animals, such as the
emu and kangaroo; and, since they have become acquainted with
Europeans, to the horse, the cow, &amp;c. They accompany the words
with significant gestures and actions. Thus, in the emu-dance, by
bending forward an arm over the fire, and making a movement with
the hand, like the motion of a bird's head, they imitate the bird
in its peculiar habits. In the horse-dance, which they call
<i>barracoota</i>,* they lay hold of each other's loins, one
following another, and imitate the prancing of the animal, while
a woman stands by and imitates the driver, gently tapping them
with a stick as they pass before her. They have also the
thunder-and-lightening dance, in which they stamp with their feet
and whirl round the fire. A frequent manoeuvre during their
<i>corrobberrys</i> is to leap from the ground while running in a
circle round the fire, and, in descending, to turn their faces to
it, crouching at the same time to the ground on their haunches,
and striking the earth with their hands. The exertion during
these performances is often very violent, occasioning individuals
to drop out of the ring, bathed in perspiration, until they have
recovered. The good humour they exhibit throughout the amusement,
which generally lasts for some hours, often till midnight, is
remarkable, considering the excitement that prevails. Sometimes
one will jostle against another, and perhaps occasion a fall to
both, which is sure to be succeeded by a general laugh. Though
the nudity of the men must necessarily offend the eye of a
European, there is not the slightest action or gesture that would
offend the modesty of the most scrupulous.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Jorgenson gives as the equivalent for "horse",
baircoutaua; Norman gives <i>parcoutenar</i>.]</p>
<p>On another evening we visited their shelters or "breakwinds".
From twenty to thirty sleep in each shelter. Here they generally
cook their food and eat their meals, and here, in the evening,
they sit round the fire and talk, or one sings, while the rest
listen with deep interest and attention, frequently applauding by
a general shout. At the suggestion of Mr. Archibald M'Lachlan,
the surgeon, they sang two of their songs for our benefit. The
first was sung by the chief of the Port Dalrymple tribe. The same
words were repeated many times in succession, accompanied by many
impassioned gestures, and an exertion of breath almost painful to
witness. Occasionally the singer gave a short sigh, as if his
breath was spent, in which the rest united with one accord. The
shout that succeeded allowed the performer a moment's pause, when
he resumed the song with great animation. During the course of
the song the chief often became highly excited, pointing
significantly with his finger, and showing remarkable expression
in his countenance, as if the subject was most important, the
people listening meanwhile with profound attention. After the
chief had concluded, the women began a song in chorus, which
showed a greater knowledge of music. I was very much surprised to
hear some sing tenor, while others sang treble. It was a hunting
song, enumerating the animals that the young married women are
wont to chase. I afterwards took down the words of the song from
the lips of some of the women.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** See p. 258, for song with interlinear
translation.]</p>
<p>The tribes now show little appearance of jealously. Many, when
in the bush, were in a state of hostility; but their animosities
are merged in the general feeling of good-will which seems to
pervade the settlement. If there is anything that betrays the
remembrance of former feuds, it is hunting. They show a
reluctance to hunt together if the tribes that compose the party
have once been at warfare, unless the Commandant or Surgeon be
with them, when his influence is considered a sufficient
guarantee against harm.</p>
<p>Two men of the Western or Port Dalrymple tribe exhibited
before us the manner in which quarrels are decided amongst them;
or, it may be described as the mode of giving vent to those
feelings of irritation which amongst Englishmen, would end in a
pugilistic encounter. The parties approach one another face to
face, and, folding their arms across their breasts, shake their
heads (which occasionally come into contact) in each other's
faces, uttering at the same time the most vociferous and angry
expressions, until one or other of them is exhausted. This custom
is called by them <i>growling</i>, and, from the specimen
afforded us by the Western lads, will not probably issue in
anything worse than a bloody nose or lip.</p>
<p>Quarrels are rare among the aborigines of the Settlement, but
when they do occur some of their tokens of displeasure are odd
and unaccountable. One of the men had a difference with his wife,
because she had broken something which he highly prized. Instead
of showing his displeasure by taking a stick and retaliating on
the offender, he rose and deliberately cut the feet of seven who
happened to be lying near him asleep, but offered no kind of
violence to his wife. After this burst of rage, his anger was
appeased, and they were reconciled. The Commandant, hearing of
the circumstance, had the man brought before him, and told him
that, as through his misconduct the women would be unable to
bring their quantum of water from the well, the offender was
required to bring all the water himself. Without saying a word or
making the least difficulty, the man set about his task, which he
soon completed, and there the affair ended.</p>
<p>It is curious that the aborigines, on occasions of this sort
mentioned above, do not generally show a disposition to retaliate
on the person who thus wreaks his vengeance upon them; they
rather endeavour to get out of his way.</p>
<p>Another quarrel fell out thus:&mdash;A married woman had
selected a certain tree, according to their practice when in the
bush, which tree, in such case, is considered the representative
of the person who makes choice of it, and is regarded as their
inviolable property, at all times to be held sacred. Through some
accident this tree, which had been selected by Roomtyenna, was
pulled down or mutilated by a party of her countrymen, which she
so violently resented that, snatching up a firebrand, she ran in
amongst them and dealt her blows very freely around. Her husband,
who was of the party, at length struck her on the head with his
waddy, and drew blood. When he saw that she bled, he was
apparently as disconcerted as she was, and would have gladly made
it up; but the lady was not so easily appeased, and it was some
time before Trygoomy-poonauh could regain his wife's smiles.</p>
<p>On a visit to the site of the intended new settlement, at a
place named by the sealers Pea-Jacket Point, we were accompanied
by the Commandant, four native men, and two of their wives. The
history of the attachment that led to the union of one of these
couples is somewhat romantic. Panneh-rooneh had long felt an
affection for Pellouny-myna, but no persuasions of his could
induce her to become his wife. One day they were crossing a river
along with many more of their countrymen, when Pellouny-myna was
suddenly seized with an attack of illness, and became unable to
support herself. The faithful lover was at her side. Seizing her
in his arms, he bore her to a place of safety, and during her
illness, which was tedious, he nursed her with the greatest
attention and most affectionate assiduity. She at length
recovered, when, overcome with gratitude, she declared that none
but Panneh-rooneh should be her husband; and from that time they
have become united by the most inviolable attachment.</p>
<p>On our return the day was very wet and boisterous. The
aborigines are not fond of travelling in the wet, nor will they
do so, except in cases of necessity. They show the same
reluctance to travelling in the dark. As soon as it is dusk they
take care to remind you that it is time to <i>crackney</i>, that
is to rest. It is well known that in their wild state they hardly
ever encamped for two nights together in the same place, in
consequence of their aversion to the dirt which accumulates about
a camp. The number of fires which this custom has given rise to
is perhaps one of the causes that the number of these people has
been so greatly over-rated. I was surprised to remark their
susceptibility of fatigue in going long distances. It does not
appear that they have been in the habit of making long or forced
marches. Each tribe confining themselves generally to a district
seldom exceeding twenty to thirty miles in its widest extent;
this peculiarity may be easily accounted for. Their principal
journeys were those made in the summer season to the highlands
from the lower tracks (the haunt of the game), which were their
resort in the winter; and these journeys did not generally
require any extraordinary expedition.</p>
<p>This short excursion has given us a further opportunity of
estimating the character of the aborigines; and the favourable
opinion we had previously formed of their disposition, and
especially of their capabilities for improvement, is more than
ever confirmed. They require to be treated with much discretion
and forbearance. They are more easily led than driven; for,
though they are very tractable and accessible to kindness, it is
easy to perceive that they consider themselves a free people. If
they do service for others, they do it through courtesy. There is
nothing that is servile or abject in their character when they
are not under the influence of fear. We are perpetually reminded
that in their taste for amusement, and in some respects in their
capacities, they are children, though more tractable than the
generality of children; but, in many things that occur within the
range of their knowledge and acquirements, they show a quickness
of perception and powers of reflection that prove them to be a
race far from deficient in intellect, and highly susceptible of
improvement.</p>
<p>From anything I have been able to learn, the aborigines do not
seem to have any notion of a superior and beneficent Being who
rules the world. They have some indistinct ideas of an evil
spirit, whom they style "the devil", especially when talking with
Europeans, but of whom there is reason to believe they have had
original notions, and for whom they have an appropriate name in
their own language. All diseases and casualties are attributed to
the agency of this malevolent power, who is also thought to
preside over the elements, especially in the phenomena of thunder
and lightning, of which they are, accordingly, much afraid. When
one of A. Cottrell's party was asked what had caused the death of
one of his comrades at the Hunter's Islands, he answered "The
devil!" One of them imitated the symptoms that usually attend
consumption in its last stages. There is no doubt that they
entertained the notion before their intercourse with Europeans.
An idea is becoming prevalent among them which looks like the
recognition of a state of being after death. It is professed to
be believed by some of them that they are transformed after death
into white men, and that they return under this renewed form to
an island in the Straits, where there is abundance of game, and
where they have the pleasure of again hunting, and subsisting
upon such animals as they killed in the chase during their
lifetime; but I am disposed to believe that this has not
originated with themselves, particularly as they connect it with
some vague idea respecting the deceased visiting England, or at
least coming from beyond seas ere he inhabit the island in
question. The want of knowledge of their language renders the
information that can be gathered on these interesting subjects
very vague.</p>
<p>With regard to form of government, very little seems to have
existed among the aborigines. A sort of patriarchal authority
under certain limitations has been exercised by the chiefs of the
respective tribes; but they have been far from exacting an
explicit obedience to their commands, and in many respects their
authority appears to have been little more than nominal; few of
the mob consisting of more persons than might be included in one
large family, the influence of the chief, who is generally in
years, has probably been of the parental kind. The people at the
Settlement call their chiefs by the appellation of Father, and
speak of the members of their own tribes as brothers and sisters.
When a separation for a long period has happened, on meeting
again they show all the attachment of relatives. An instance of
this occurred at Woolnorth, when two women, who had lived with
sealers, were brought in. Jumbo, another woman who was present,
called one of these her sister, having belonged to the same mob
as herself. A. Cottrell informed me that their interview was very
affecting. Neither spoke for some time, but, throwing their arms
round each other's necks, they remained in that attitude, the
tears trickling down their cheeks, until at length, these first
emotions having somewhat subsided, they began to talk and laugh,
and exhibit all the demonstrations of extravagant joy.</p>
<p>The natives show a great dislike to allusions to the absent,
whether the separation be caused by difference of situation or by
death. If the name of the absent person be mentioned, it is
customary with them, when with Europeans, to signify their
displeasure by signs, as if they considered it unpropitious.</p>
<p>Like all persons in a savage state, the natives eat more than
would be convenient to a European. In their wild condition they
were subject to a scarcity of food, which, being succeeded by the
return of abundance, would induce them to fill themselves to
repletion. They eat almost every animal that inhabits the woods,
from the emu and kangaroo down to the kangaroo-rat. Mutton-birds
and penguins are the principal birds used by them, emus being
very scarce. There are some other birds that are considered good
eating, as the swan and the duck; but these they cannot often
catch, unless it be the young swans. They are very partial to
their eggs. The emu is considered a great delicacy, which may be
one reason that emus are more numerous now than a few years ago,
when the number of aborigines in the bush was greater. The roots
eaten by the natives are extremely numerous and abundant, as the
fern (a species much the same as that common in England), which
is eaten either roasted or raw. The upper extremity of the stem
of the fern-tree is also a favourite article of food, and a
number of other things which I am unable to describe. There is a
species of punk or fungus found on the trunks or among the roots
of decayed trees, which contributes to the support of the blacks,
as well as the white grub, which is also found in rotten timber.
Of the latter the natives are extravagantly fond, eating them raw
as well as roasted. A species of truffle, known in the Colony by
the name of native bread, found in the vicinity of decayed wood,
and of the order of <i>Fungi</i>, is a favourite article of food;
so also is a large lizard, often twelve or fourteen inches in
length, and called the iguana.</p>
<p>A custom prevails amongst them for which I can assign no
reason, nor do they seem themselves able to give any. Some will
eat only the male of a particular species, others only the
female; and I am assured by those who know well their habits,
that they will rather starve than infringe this rule. The morning
we arrived at Pea-jacket, a wallaby was taken by Tommy, at a time
when meat was by no means plentiful; he, however, gave the whole
of it away, nor could I induce him to taste it. It was a male,
and the only answer I could get from him was that he never ate
the male of that animal. The rest of the party partook of it.
Butter, or food that is fat or greasy, they show at first an
aversion to; the animals that inhabit the forest, especially the
kangaroo and wallaby, are generally lean.</p>
<p>They seem to have been acquainted with no other mode of
cooking than that of roasting. Boiling was quite strange to them,
and meat prepared in that way appears less agreeable to them than
the other. The plan they adopt in cooking mutton-birds is, to
throw the bird on the fire until all the feathers are singed off,
when it is withdrawn and gutted. When several are prepared in
this manner, they are spitted on a stick between two and three
feet in length, one end of which is run into the ground, while
the other enables the person who is standing by to turn the
birds, or give them such a direction towards the fire as ensures
their being properly cooked.</p>
<p>The animals were cooked in the usual summary method; first, by
throwing them on the fire until the hair was singed, after which
the entrails were extracted, and the carcase returned to the fire
until sufficiently roasted. The eggs were also roasted among the
embers. They cooked the shell-fish (<i>Haliotis</i>, or
mutton-fish) very nicely, by placing them on the embers with the
fish uppermost until they are roasted. They then insert the end
of a long stick into the fish, which readily leaves the shell;
and, were there no better fare, we should have thought them very
tolerable food, though the large ones are apt to be tough.</p>
<p>The blacks make very neat, or, at least, very useful, baskets
of native grass, which the women plait in such manner as to
render them strong and effective for holding the few articles
they carry about with them. These are also used in fishing. The
women are excellent swimmers, and are most expert in diving for
shell-fish. These employments devolve almost exclusively on the
females, though the men are generally practised in them in a
degree. In diving for crayfish, the women take a basket in their
hand, and, on reaching the rocks at the bottom, they dexterously
seize the crayfish with their fingers, and putting them quickly
into the basket, ascend to the surface. In the same way they
procure mutton-fish, oysters, mussels, and several other kinds of
shell-fish, a species of food they are particularly partial
to.</p>
<p>In Safety Cove, Port Arthur, we saw some of the aboriginal
women dive for fish. They appear to be half amphibious, such is
their dexterity in the water, and, what is more singular, they
appear to float with their heads in an upright position above
water, without any effort, and this in the midst of kelp and
other seaweed that would terrify the generality of skilful
swimmers. They put aside the weed with their hands, or lift it
over their heads as it becomes wrapt round them, and fearlessly
dive head foremost into the midst of it, passing the branches of
kelp through their hands as a sailor would a rope. When they see
a crayfish on the bottom, they seize it by the back and ascend
promptly to the surface, where they readily disengage themselves
from the kelp and weed, and throw their prey to their companions
on shore. Sometimes they put their heads a little below the
surface, and look along the bottom until they descry a
shell-fish, when in a moment their heels appear above the
surface, and, diving to the bottom, they secure their prey. The
men are said to be far inferior to the women in diving, as they
consider it the province of the females to procure fish. The
aborigines are excessively fond of shell-fish.</p>
<p>On our visit to Macquarie Harbour, in May, 1832, we observed
traces of the aborigines in several places about Port Davey and
the sea-shore near the mouth of Macquarie Harbour. There were
numerous places where they had had fires, about which the shells
of mutton-fish, oysters, mussels, crayfish, limpets, and
periwinkles were scattered. Near Wellington Head there were the
remains of some boats, formed of strips of the swamp ti-tree of
Macquarie Harbour (<i>Melaleuca decussata</i>). We learned from
the pilot (Mr. Lucas) that, about three months ago, he saw five
of these, containing three or four persons each, inclusive of
children, cross the Harbour from the northern shore. Each of them
was drawn across by a man swimming on each side of the boat,
holding it with one hand. He therefore concludes the number that
visit that neighbourhood to be from twenty to thirty. He says
they are shy, but have not committed any outrage. They exchanged
a girl of about fourteen for a dog; but the girl, not appearing
to like her situation, she was taken back by them, and the dog
returned.</p>
<p>We learned from A. Cottrell some further particulars
respecting the aborigines. The Western tribes appear to have been
generally in the practice of burning their dead. The body is
placed in an upright posture on logs of wood, other logs are
piled around it till the superstructure assumes a conical form.
The pile is then fired, and occasionally replenished with fuel,
till the remains are consumed to ashes. These are carefully
collected by the relatives of the deceased, and are tied up in a
piece of kangaroo skin, and worn about their persons, not only as
tokens of remembrance, but as a charm against disease and
accident. It is common for the survivors to besmear their faces
with the ashes of the deceased. Those who suffer from the same
complaint of which the dead man died, resort to the same practice
as a means of cure. It is also customary to sing a dirge every
morning for a considerable time after the death of their friends.
The chief relative takes the most prominent part on these
occasions; but it is not confined to relatives; many others join
in the lamentation, and exhibit all the symptoms of unfeigned
sorrow. Besmearing the face with the ashes of the deceased is
generally an accompaniment; and tears may often be seen streaming
down the cheeks of the mourners.</p>
<p>A singular idea prevails among the natives, that no one
actually dies till the sun sets. If the parties are dead in point
of fact, the survivors profess to regard the symptoms as mere
indications that life will depart as soon as the sun goes down,
and until that period they do not treat them as dead."</p>
<p>Under date 9th November, 1832, Mr. Walker writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>"There are, it is supposed, the remains of only four tribes at
large on the island. Three of them frequent the coast between
Macquarie Harbour and Cape Grim. The fourth tribe frequent the
district of Port Davey. It is the opinion of both G. A. Robinson
and A. Cottrell that these tribes do not include more than a
hundred individuals, although they are not among those whose
numbers have been thinned by coming into hostile collision with
Europeans, with the exception of one tribe, that has on two or
three occasions encountered the Van Diemen's Land Company's
servants. Individuals have in these encounters been killed on
both sides, but the number is very limited on either. This
strongly confirms the opinion we have for some time entertained,
that the number of aborigines in the island has been greatly
exaggerated. It does not appear (admitting that there are about a
hundred in the four tribes yet in the bush) that the number now
in existence in the bush and at the aboriginal settlement exceeds
220 or 230. Allowing that their numbers have been thinned by the
warfare that has subsisted between them and the whites, and that
disease has also tended to thin their ranks (which appears to
have been the case, especially among the Bruny Island natives),
it does not seem probable that the whole of the aboriginal
population, from the time of the landing of Europeans to the
present moment, has ever at one time much exceeded five or six
hundred individuals."</p>

DIEMEN'S LAND:&mdash;<br>
TWO POPULAR SONGS.&mdash;<br>
TRANSLATION OF GENESIS, CHAP. I.&mdash;<br>
ABORIGINAL NAMES OF MEN AND WOMEN.</h4>
<p>15 October, 1832.&mdash;Several of the aborigines were invited
into the Commandant's hut for the purpose of enabling me to take
down a few words as specimens of the language. The plan I adopted
was to point to different objects, which they named, several
repeating the word for my better information. At a subsequent
period, I uttered the words in the hearing of others with whom I
had had no communication on the subject of their language. If
these understood my expressions, and pointed to the object the
word was intended to represent, I took for granted I had obtained
with tolerable accuracy the word used by them for that purpose.
When I read to them in their own language one of their native
songs, they were beyond measure astonished and gratified,
following the words with their voices, and frequently
interrupting me with shouts of approbation. Their language
appears to me to be far from inharmonious, and, when accompanied
by a chanting tune, as in the songs of the women, is pleasing to
the ear.</p>

<p>There are some objects, and these very numerous, for which
every tribe, or "mob", has a different name. There are also some
peculiarities (of dialect we may suppose) in the languages of
tribes dwelling in remote situations that render them not easily,
if at all, understood by each other.* Several individuals,
particularly G. A. Robinson and his colleague, Anthony Cottrell,
are able to converse with tolerable fluency in the native
dialects, but I understand that no one has reduced the language
to writing, which is to be regretted.</p>
<p class="foot">[* It had been stated on a previous evening (by
Dr. Lang) that Van Diemen's Land had formerly been peopled with
four nations, who each held a particular portion of the island.
This opinion must have originated in the circumstance of his (Mr.
Robinson's) having stated that he had necessarily learned four
languages in order to make himself understood by the natives
generally. But, as regarded nations, he could truly say that the
island of Van Diemen's Land was divided and subdivided by the
natives into districts, and contained many nations. Their
divisions he intended at some future period to point out, as he
intended to execute a map of the island on aboriginal principles,
with the aborigines' names for the mountains, rivers, and
localities. Maria Island and Tasman's Peninsula had also been
inhabited: but the different tribes spoke quite a different
language; there was not the slightest analogy between the
languages.&mdash;<i>Report of the Public Meeting held on 19th
October, 1838, at Sydney, containing the speech of G. A.
Robinson: Reprinted from the "Colonist" of 31st October</i>,
1838: <i>Bath</i>, 1865, p. 3. In another place Mr. Robinson
states that he had become, acquainted with sixteen tribes.]</p>
<p>Some of the aboriginal terms have a very indefinite and
extended meaning, as in the words "<i>clackny</i>" and
<i>pomleh</i>. The former means to be, to exist, to rest, sit
down or lie down, to stop, remain, dwell, sleep, and I know not
how many more significations. The latter is used in a variety of
ways, but more particularly where art, or ingenuity, or an
exertion of power is applied to the production of anything.
Everything that has required any sort of manipulation has been
<i>pomleh</i>, <i>i.e</i>., made, or put together, or called into
existence.</p>
<p>It is also remarkable that the aborigines have hardly any
general terms. They have not even a term to represent "trees" or
"animals" generally.</p>

attempted the translation of the first three chapters of Genesis,
and has succeeded as well as could have been anticipated. It is
extremely difficult to come at the idiom, as every tribe speaks a
different dialect, it might also be said a different language,
and even among the individuals of the same tribe a great
difference is perceptible. The pronunciation is very arbitrary
and indefinite. The literal translation is confined in great
measure to the verbs and the nouns. It is not clearly ascertained
Whether prepositions and conjunctions or anything analogous to
the expletives in use with us are contained in the aboriginal
tongue. T.W. has composed a considerable vocabulary of words.</p>

<p>The aboriginal words are for the most part placed under the
analogous English ones. Those commencing with an English syllable
are such as the aborigines have none representing the idea in
their own language. Thus, they seem to have had no idea of the
existence of a creative presiding power, nor any term
corresponding with such a sentiment, in their vocabulary. The
English word has, therefore, been adopted by the translator with
the native termination added, making "Godneh". The same with
respect to several others. Several of these anglified terms are
now in such constant use among the natives that they may be
considered as incorporated in the language. The word "grassneh",
for "grass", is much more frequently used among those at the
settlement than the original term given above. It is doubtful
whether "myneh", for "me" or "I", may not be traced to the same
origin.</p>

<h3>SOME NOTES ON THE TRIBAL DIVISIONS OF THE ABORIGINES OF
TASMANIA.</h3>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>BY JAMES BACKHOUSE WALKER.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> estimates of the aboriginal population of
Tasmania before the advent of Europeans vary very considerably.
G. A. Robinson always maintained that, in 1804, the number of the
aborigines was from 6000 to 8000. Captain Kelly, in his evidence
before Colonel Arthur's Committee in 1830, estimated the native
population at 5000; but he supposed that the number was still
very great in the unsettled parts of the Colony, which we now
know was not the case. On the other hand, Backhouse put the
number as low as 700 to 1000. Dr. Milligan says: "Assuming that
the number of tribes and sub-tribes throughout the territory was
about twenty, and that each mustered, of men, women, and
children, 50 to 250 individuals, and allowing them numbers
proportioned to the means of subsistence within the limits of
their respective hunting grounds, it does not appear probable
that the aggregate aboriginal population did materially, if at
all, exceed 2000."</p>
<p>A like uncertainty exists as to their tribal divisions. G. A.
Robinson, in a speech made in Sydney in 1838, shortly after he
had left Flinders Island, states "that he had necessarily learnt
four languages to make himself understood by the natives
generally. But, as regarded nations, he could truly say that the
island was divided and subdivided by the natives into districts,
and contained many nations. Their divisions he intended at some
future time to point out, as he intended to execute a map of the
island on aboriginal principles, with the aborigines' names for
mountains, rivers, and districts."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this map&mdash;if ever made&mdash;has been lost
with the rest of Robinson's papers on the natives, and the
information available is not sufficient to enable us to determine
with any accuracy either the total number of the aborigines or
the limits of the respective tribes.</p>
<p>In considering the question of their numbers, it must be borne
in mind that the parts of Tasmania capable of affording
subsistence to a hunting people were limited in area. The West
Coast is shut off from the Centre and East&mdash;for long the
only settled parts&mdash;by a wide region of mountain and forest,
extending throughout the whole length of the island. In the dense
forests covering a large part of this region, the heavy timber is
tangled with an almost impenetrable undergrowth, in which
scarcely any animal or bird is found to disturb the silence.
Where the forest gives place to bare mountain peak or to
so-called "plain", the "button-grass" * or the stunted scrub
constituting the sole growth, is riot much more favourable to
animal life. In places, wallaby and kangaroo are to be found,
but, as a general rule, the "badger" (<i>i.e</i>., wombat) is the
only game. It will be seen, therefore, that the native population
was mainly confined to the sea coast, where they could obtain an
abundant supply of shell-fish and crayfish, and to the lightly
timbered and open lands of the central valley and of parts of the
east and north-east, where opossum, wallaby, kangaroo, emu, and
other game were more or less plentiful.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The "button-grass" is a species of sedge
(<i>Gymnoscoenus sphaerocephalus</i>&mdash;Nat. Ord.
<i>Cyperaceae</i>).]</p>
<p>It appears that the blacks were accustomed to take
considerable pains, by means of periodical burnings, to keep down
the scrub and promote the growth of grass on their favourite
hunting-grounds. Many open plains, especially in the north, which
were formally known as favourite resorts of the blacks,
subsequently became overgrown with forest through the
discontinuance of these annual burnings.</p>
<p>They usually roamed the country in small groups or parties,
probably composed of nearly related families living together.
Their camps rarely contained more than 30 or 40
individuals&mdash;men, women, and children. At certain seasons of
the year, however, large hunting parties were formed, in which
the whole tribe, or possibly more than one tribe, joined forces
to surround and drive the game. Such was, doubtless, the
gathering of the Oyster Bay natives at Risdon in 1804, which was
attended with such an unfortunate result. The number of natives,
men and women, then engaged in driving the kangaroo, was
variously stated at from 300 to 500, though it is probable that
even the smaller number was an exaggerated estimate. Captain
Kelly, in his evidence before the Committee, says that he saw a
mob of 300 at Brown's River in 1806, and about a dozen instances
of mobs numbering from 150 to 300 are reported between 1804 and
1826; but all these statements must be taken with considerable
allowance for exaggeration.</p>
<p>The natives were in the habit of visiting the coast in the
winter, it is said between June and October, though some of the
tribes in the interior may not have had access to the sea.
Certain tribes must have lived on the coast almost constantly.
Knopwood says that he had understood that the natives cross the
country from east to west in the month of March; this would apply
to the East Coast tribes only. Upon a consideration of the scanty
available evidence and all the surrounding circumstances, we may
reject as exaggerated the conjectural guesses of 7000, or even
5000, as the original number of the natives. We may accept as the
best approximation to the truth that we are likely to obtain, Dr.
Milligan's more moderate estimate that the total aboriginal
population of Tasmania did not at any time exceed 2000 souls.</p>
<p>Of the tribal organization of the aborigines practically
nothing is known, and the limits of the tribal divisions cannot
be laid down with any approach to certainty. O.. A. Robinson and
other writers use the word "tribe" with a good deal of laxity.
Sometimes it is used to designate a small sub-tribe living in one
community&mdash;<i>e.g</i>., the Macquarie Harbour tribe,
numbering 30 souls only&mdash;sometimes to indicate a whole
group&mdash;<i>e.g</i>., the Oyster Bay and Big River tribes,
which included several sub-tribes and a considerable population.
As the whole group in some cases took its name from a prominent
sub-tribe (<i>e.g</i>., Oyster Bay), it is often doubtful whether
the group or the sub-tribe is intended.</p>
<p>G. W. Walker says that the members of the same "tribe" spoke
of each other as "brother" and "sister". Kelly, in his Boat
expedition, 1815-16, says that the chief, Laman-bunganah, at
Ringarooma Point, on the North-East Coast, told him that he was
at war with his "brother" Tolo-bunganah, a powerful chief at
Eddystone Point, on the East Coast. The term translated "brother"
must therefore have had a wide application, being used with
relation to tribes or sub-tribes which were hostile, as well as
to those which were friendly.</p>
<p>In 1830, Robinson stated that he had been in communication
with sixteen "tribes". As this was long after many of the native
hunting-grounds had been invaded by the whites, and the original
tribal organization had consequently, been much disturbed, it is
probable that the number of tribes was originally greater. As we
have seen, Milligan conjecturally puts the number at twenty.
Although Robinson dignifies the tribes with the name of
"nations", they were known to the settlers by the designation of
"mobs". This conveys a more correct idea of their numerical
strength, which, in many tribes, was as low as 30, and probably
in no case exceeded 200, or at most 250.</p>
<p>These "mobs" or sub-tribes group themselves into several broad
divisions, more properly deserving the name of "tribes". In these
larger divisions separate languages or dialects were spoken, the
vocabularies of which were widely different, as appears from
Milligan's Vocabulary. Minor differences of dialect must have
been numerous, for Robert Clark, the catechist, states that on
his arrival at the Flinders' Settlement in 1834, eight or ten
different languages or dialects were spoken amongst the 200
natives then at the establishment, and that the blacks were
"instructing each other to speak their respective tongues."</p>
<p>Robinson, as already cited, says that there were four main
languages. Of these, Milligan gives us the vocabularies of three;
viz.:&mdash;(1) South; (2) West and North-West; and (3) East
Coast. To these we may add, (4) North-East tribes.</p>
<p>We may now proceed to consider these four main groups more in
detail.</p>
<br>
<a name="ch-40" id="ch-40"></a>
<h4>1. SOUTHERN TRIBES.</h4>
<p class="negindent">"Tribes about Mount Royal, Brun&eacute;
Island, Recherche-Bay, and the South of
Tasmania."&mdash;<i>Milligan's Vocabulary</i>.</p>
<p>These Tribes occupied both shores of D'Entrecasteaux Channel
and the coast of the mainland as far as South Cape. The French
voyagers in 1792, and again in 1802, had opportunities of
observing these natives in their primitive state. They found them
friendly and well-disposed. Labillardi&egrave;re and P&eacute;ron
have preserved many interesting particulars respecting them. In
the more southerly part of the district the mountains, heavily
wooded, nearly approach the shore, and here the blacks must have
been mainly dependent on the sea for their food. Further north,
towards the mouth of the Huon, at Port Cygnet, North-West Bay,
and North Bruny, the country was more open and favourable for
game. The banks of the Upper Huon were too heavily timbered to
afford much subsistence. The Bruny blacks were numerous,
especially on the lightly-wooded northern part of the island,
which was a favourite hunting-ground. It seems to have been
visited by the mainland natives, who crossed the channel in
canoes. The natives were numerous on the west bank of the
Derwent&mdash;at Blackman's Bay, Brown's River, &amp;c. At the
latter place 300 were seen in 1806. In all this country wallaby,
kangaroo, and opossum would be fairly plentiful. It cannot be
determined how far these tribes extended to the northward. They
may possibly have occupied the present site of Hobart, and even
further up the western shore of the Derwent, but it is also quite
possible that this country was claimed as a hunting-ground by the
Big River tribe. There is nothing in the features of the ground
to forbid either alternative, and there is no evidence to decide
the point. Kelly (Evidence, Aboriginal Committee) says that the
Southern natives were a finer race than those in the interior,
and also that they "took no part" with the latter.</p>
<br>
<a name="ch-41" id="ch-41"></a>
<h4>2. WESTERN TRIBES.</h4>
<p align="center">"North-West and Western
Tribes."&mdash;<i>Milligan's Vocabulary</i>.</p>
<p>The natives on the west of the island must have been mainly
confined to the sea coast, where they could draw their support
from the sea, the country inland being generally unsuitable for
game. Kelly, whose boat voyage was made at midsummer, 1815, found
natives at various places all along the coast, from a point
opposite the Maatsuyker Islands off the south coast to beyond
Cape Grim in the north-west. From the nature of the country we
may conclude that those to the east of South-West Cape belonged
to the Western tribes rather than to the Southern group
established at Recherche Bay. They were bold enough to cross to
the Maatsuykers, which lie three miles out from the main, for
Flinders, in 1798, noticed with surprise that the scrub on the
largest island had been burnt. There was a small tribe at Port
Davey, and another at Macquarie Harbour, which (according to
Stokes and Backhouse) numbered some thirty souls only. The latter
had canoes of bark in which they crossed the harbour. They made
an attack on Kelly's party.</p>
<p>At Trial Harbour, near Mount Heemskirk, there are very large
extensive shell mounds. Further north, on the Pieman and Arthur
Rivers, there were either one or two tribes, probably near the
coast, though here there are occasional tracts which would
support game. In 1832 Robinson speaks of four tribes, numbering
collectively 100 souls, between Port Davey and Cape Grim. It is
not clear whether he meant to include the Cape Grim natives. The
latter were a strong and fierce tribe. In 1815 Kelly fell in with
a mob of 50 on the largest of the Hunters' group, <i>i.e</i>.,
Robbins Island. They made a fierce attack on his party. It is
said that the natives visited all the islands of the Hunters'
Group by swimming, no doubt with the help of logs or canoes. They
probably reached Albatross Island, seeing that they had a name
for it, <i>Tangatema</i>. Though the mainland is in many places
densely timbered, there are open downs at Woolnorth and other
spots where game would be fairly plentiful.</p>
<p>There were tribes at Circular Head and at Emu Bay. Most of the
hinterland was covered with dense, almost impenetrable, forest,
but the high downs of the Hampshire and Surrey Hills and
Middlesex Plains were favourite resorts. Other patches of open
country at intervals would probably afford to these tribes the
means of inland communication with their kinsmen on the west, as
well as the more circuitous route by the coast. These open spaces
were formally more numerous, being kept clear by burning. Many of
them have become overgrown with timber since the removal of the
natives.</p>
<p>Hobs (Boat Voyage, 1824) says that the natives travelled along
the coast between Circular Head and Port Sorell, keeping the
country burnt for that purpose. This group of tribes may possibly
have extended as far east as Port Sorell, though the Port Sorell
blacks were more probably connected with the Port Dalrymple
tribe.</p>
<p>Kelly (Evidence, Aboriginal Committee) states that the West
Coast natives were a finer race than the tribes in the interior,
and had no intercourse with them. The southern and western groups
appear to have been quite isolated from those on the eastern side
of the island.</p>
<br>
<a name="ch-42" id="ch-42"></a>
<h4>3. CENTRAL TRIBES.</h4>
<p align="center">"Tribes from Oyster Bay to
Pittwater."&mdash;<i>Milligan's Vocabulary</i>.</p>
<p>The interior and eastern parts of the island were occupied by
two powerful tribes&mdash;the Oyster Bay and the Big River. Their
northern boundary may be roughly described as an irregular line
beginning on the East Coast south of St. Patrick's Head, passing
along the ranges to the south of the South Esk River to a point
at St. Peter's Pass (north of Oatlands), and thence to the Great
Lake. It was these two tribes who were the most implacable
enemies of the settlers, and it was against them, almost
exclusively, that Colonel Arthur's "Black Line" operations were
directed.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">(a)&mdash;<i>The Oyster Bay Tribe</i>.</p>
<p>The Oyster Bay tribe or group of tribes occupied the East
Coast, and extended inland to the central valley. They took their
name from Oyster Bay (Great Swanport). The long extent of coast,
following the inlets and peninsulas from north of Schouten Main
(Freycinet's Peninsula) to Risdon on the Derwent, abounds in
crayfish and in oysters and other shell-fish, affording an
abundant supply of their favourite food. On the East Coast the
hills lie some distance back from the sea, and the country
yielded a supply of game. Here the natives were numerous,
especially at certain seasons. It is said that as many as 300
have been seen in one mob. Robinson mentions two tribes on the
coast&mdash;the Oyster Bay proper and the Little Swanport tribes.
Their canoes were seen at Schouten and Maria Islands. The latter
was a favourite resort, and here Baudin's expedition (1802) fell
in with a large mob, who showed themselves decidedly hostile.
Marion came into collision with them at Marion Bay in 1772. They
roamed as far south as Tasman's Peninsula, resorting to a spot
near Mount Communication to obtain "flints". Tribes belonging to
this group occupied the country behind the East Coast
Tier&mdash;Eastern Marshes, Native Plains, and Prosser's Plains.
They were numerous in the Pittwater district&mdash;comprising
Coal River and Richmond, Sorell, and South Arm. Mobs of 100 were
seen at South Arm and also at Kangaroo Point (opposite Hobart),
and 300 at Risdon, in 1804. To this same group of tribes
doubtless belonged the natives who occupied the fine hunting
country in the Jordan Valley, about Bagdad, Green Ponds, and
Lovely Banks, towards the great central divide. The names Hunting
Ground, Native Corners, Native Hut River, and others, indicate
some of their ordinary resorts. Brodribb (Evidence, Aboriginal
Committee) says that the eastern natives did not go further west
than Abyssinia, near Bothwell.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">(b)&mdash;<i>The Big River Tribe</i>.</p>
<p>The country to the west of the Central and Jordan Valleys was
occupied by the Big River tribe. They took their name from the
Big River, the early name of the river now known as the Ouse.
They occupied the valley of the Derwent&mdash;with its
tributaries, Ouse, Clyde, and Shannon&mdash;and the elevated
plateau of the Lake Country, 2000 to 2500 feet above sea-level.
They travelled westward to Lake St. Clair and Mount King William,
and probably still further west beyond Mount Arrowsmith. All this
district abounds in game&mdash;kangaroo, wallaby, and opossum. At
Split Rock (near the Great Lake), at the London Marshes (near
Marlborough), and at the Native Tier, on the River Plenty, they
found stone suitable for their rude implements. From the great
central plateau they seem to have made descents into the district
between Bothwell and Oatlands. We cannot determine the boundary
between them and their eastern neighbours, the Oyster Bay tribes.
Brodribb (Evidence Aboriginal Committee) says that he considered
the Oyster Bay and Big River natives were one tribe, though the
eastern natives did not go further west than Abyssinia. When
harried by the whites the two tribes made common cause against
the strangers, and finally the Oyster Bay natives took refuge in
the Lake Plateau, where Robinson captured them, not far from Lake
St. Clair or Mount Arrowsmith. It cannot, however, be concluded
that they were not originally distinct tribes. They were hostile
to the Northern tribes. Gilbert Robinson (Evidence Aboriginal
Committee) states that either the Stony Creek or Port Dalrymple
natives had killed many of the Oyster Bay natives.</p>
<br>
<a name="ch-43" id="ch-43"></a>
<h4>4. NORTHERN AND NORTH-EASTERN TRIBES.</h4>
<p>There remain to be considered the tribes of the North and
North-East. The language of the Ben Lomond tribe is described as
a distinct dialect by Kelly, Walker, Backhouse, and others. Kelly
(Boat Voyage, 1815) states that Briggs, the sealer, could speak
the language of the North-East Coast tribes fluently. We may
infer that this was the fourth language of which Robertson
speaks, and it may have been common&mdash;with more or less
variation&mdash;to the North-East Coast and Ben Lomond natives.
It is difficult to determine the relationship of the tribes of
the North Centre, the Port Dalrymple, and the Stony Creek tribes.
The balance of probabilities inclines us to the belief that they
were related rather to the North-E astern group than to their
Southern neighbours of the Oyster Bay tribe (with whom we know
they were at feud), or to the tribes of the North-West. There is
no mention of these tribes using canoes.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">(a)&mdash;<i>The Stony Creek Tribe.</i></p>
<p>The pastoral district known as "The Midlands", lying in the
centre of the Island, to the north of the Oyster Bay and Big
River natives, was occupied by the Stony Creek tribe. They took
their name from a small southern tributary of the South Esk, near
Lewellyn, to the north of Campbell Town. They occupied the
Campbell Town and Ross districts, going south to Blackman's
River, Salt Pan Plains, and Antill Ponds, and up to the foot of
the Western Mountains, probably including the valleys of the
Macquarie, Isis, and Lake Rivers. A mob of 200 were seen on the
Macquarie River in 1819. It is stated that about 1829, under
their Chief Eumarrah, they frequented Norfolk Plains on the Lake
River. If so they must have been allies of the Port Dalrymple
natives. The country they occupied abounded in game, being
lightly timbered and well grassed. They had excellent "flint"
quarries at Stocker's Bottom and Glen Morriston, to the
south-east of Ross. In the Tasmanian Museum there is a fine
collection of stone implements procured at Glen Morriston by the
late Mr. Scott. It is said that the Oyster Bay natives also
obtained "flints" from the same localities. The Stony Creek
natives were a strong tribe, and gave much trouble to the
settlers. Part of their district was included in the "Black Line"
operations.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">(b)&mdash;<i>The Port Dalrymple Tribe.</i></p>
<p>The country to the north of the Stony Creek
natives&mdash;including the neighbourhood of Perth, Evandale,
Launceston, the North Esk, and probably both banks of the
Tamar&mdash;was occupied by the Port Dalrymple tribe.* They are
said to have mustered in large numbers on various occasions. Once
200 of them proceeded from the neighbourhood of Launceston, by
way of Paterson's Plains (Evandale) to the Lake River. Native
Point, near Perth, a favourite haunt. Here they got stone for
their implements. They probably roamed westward as far as
Longford and Westbury, if not further. The districts they
occupied are some of the finest in Tasmania; in its native state,
a well grassed country with abundance of game. Their relation to
other tribes is uncertain. They appear to have been in league
with their Southern neighbours&mdash;the Stony Creek
natives&mdash;and were, probably, also related to the
North-Eastern group. The tribes as far as Port Sorell, and even
as far as the Mersey, may have belonged to this group. But there
is no evidence to show how far to the eastward the North-Western
group of tribes extended. Possibly, the boundary may be placed in
the forest country on the west bank of the Mersey. But it is
uncertain to which group the Mersey and Port Sorell natives
belonged. The evidence of language is not of much assistance. The
Tamar was <i>Ponrabbel</i>; the Mersey was <i>Paranapple</i> or
<i>Pirinappl</i>. The variation is hardly sufficient to establish
either difference or consanguinity.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The settlements on the Tamar were at first
known under the name of Port Dalrymple.]</p>
<p>Kelly (Evidence Aboriginal Committee) states that the tribes
of the North and East take part with the tribes in the interior.
He probably means that the Port Dalrymple natives (North) were in
league with those of Stony Creek; and the Oyster Bay natives
(East) with those of the Big River.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">(c)&mdash;<i>The Ben Lomond Tribe</i>.</p>
<p>The Ben Lomond natives occupied the fertile valley of the
South Esk, abounding in game. Their neighbours to the west were
the Stony Creek tribe. They may have had access to the sea coast
at Falmouth, by St. Mary's Pass, though this was a dense forest.
They took their name from the great Ben Lomond range, rising to
an elevation of over 5000 feet. The valleys of the mountain were
probably too densely wooded to afford much game, but that they
roamed over the highlands is shown by their having given the name
of <i>Meenamata</i> to the lagoon on the plateau at the summit of
the mountain Perhaps the strongest proof of the separateness of
the North-Eastern tribes&mdash;or, at least, that of Ben
Lomond&mdash;is afforded by the variation in the word for
"river". The South Esk was <i>Mangana lienta</i>. Elsewhere the
word was <i>linah</i>: <i>e.g</i>., Huon, <i>Tahune linah</i>
(South); Jordan, <i>Kutah linah</i> (S. interior).</p>
<br>
<p align="center">(d)&mdash;<i>North-East Coast Tribes</i>.</p>
<p>We find mention of tribes or sub-tribes along the whole
stretch of coast from George's Bay, on the East Coast, to the
entrance to the Tamar (Port Dalrymple), on the North. On various
occasions mobs were met with at George's Bay and George's River;
at the Bay of Fires and Eddystone Point; at Cape Portland, in the
extreme north-east; at Ringarooma Point; at Forester's River; at
Piper's River; and on the east side of the mouth of the Tamar. In
1806, a mob of 200 natives came to the first settlement at George
Town, just within the entrance to Port Dalrymple, on the east
bank of the Tamar. In the north-east part of the island the
country is, in many places, open for some miles inland from the
coast, and in such places there would be game. The interior is
mountainous and heavily timbered, and, very probably, was not
occupied by the natives.</p>
<p>In conclusion, to sum up the result of our inquiry, we find,
(1) That the aboriginal population probably did not exceed 2000:
(2) that there were four main groups of tribes; viz.&mdash;(a)
South; (b) West and North-West; (c) Central and East; (d) North
and North-East: (3) that these groups were divided by strongly
marked differences of language; (4) that the southern and Western
tribes were completely isolated from those on the eastern side of
the island, and that a similar separation existed between the
North and North-Eastern tribes on the one hand, and those of the
Centre and East on the other; (5) that within the groups each
tribe and sub-tribe probably occupied a definite district which
was recognised as its special territory; (6) that the tribes
within each group, though generally leagued together, were at
times at feud with each other; (7) that in later years, after the
European occupation, the tribes&mdash;especially those of the
east and centre of the island&mdash;laid aside their differences,
and made common cause against the white intruders.</p>

<h3>THE TASMANIAN ABORIGINES.</h3>
<p align="center"><small>BY JAMES BACKHOUSE WALKER.</small></p>
<p><small>TO</small> anthropologists the aborigines of Tasmania
presented an exceedingly interesting object of study. Professor
Tylor had remarked that in the tribes of Tasmania, only just
extinct, we had men whose condition had changed but little since
the early Stone Age, and whose life gave us some idea of the
earliest prehistoric tribes of the old world, the Drift and Cave
men of Europe. It is therefore much to be regretted that so
little information remains respecting the Tasmanians in their
wild state. The early voyagers, especially the French, did their
best with the opportunities they had in casual meeting with the
aborigines, and have left us exceedingly interesting and valuable
accounts of their observations. But their visits were too short,
and their acquaintance with the natives too superficial, to allow
them to gain any intimate knowledge of native customs, or ways of
life and thought. They could, at most, note down a few noticeable
external characteristics.</p>
<p>During the early years of the Colony, when the blacks were, on
the whole, friendly, no one thought it worth while to take the
trouble of studying their ways, or of making any attempt to
investigate their tribal customs. If they had been as picturesque
as the Bed Indian or the Maori, we should probably have known a
great deal more about them. But the scientific study of
anthropology had not then begun, and the blacks were so low in
the scale of civilization that they were deemed unworthy of
attention. For no one then recognised that it was the very fact
of them being at the bottom of the scale that would have made a
thorough knowledge of their ideas of such interest and
importance.</p>
<p>Even after the aborigines were imprisoned on Flinders, when
such opportunities lay close to the hand of Dr. Milligan and
others, it is sad to reflect how little was done. A vocabulary by
Milligan, a paper by Davies, and some observations collected by
Backhouse and others, are almost the sum total.</p>
<p>G. A. Robinson was probably the only man who thoroughly
understood the aborigines. He could have supplied valuable
information as to their tribal usages and ways of thinking, yet,
so far as I know, he has not left behind him even the briefest
account of the people for whom he ran such risks, though there
are still preserved, in the Chief Secretary's office, very
voluminous reports of his expeditions. Robinson told my father
many years ago that he had a large quantity of MS. respecting the
aborigines, which he intended to publish.</p>
<p>I have in my possession a letter dated from Prahran, Widcombe
Hill, Bath, England, March 19, 1864, written by Robinson to the
late Mr. Witcomb, in which he says:&mdash;"I am now arranging my
papers (the vocabulary included) for publication." The papers
were never published. Robinson died at Bath, somewhere before
1870, I think; and there is, I suppose, not the least hope of
recovering a MS., which would be highly interesting.</p>
<p>The information which has been preserved respecting our native
tribes is scattered through scores of books and articles,
including casual references in voyages, histories, public
documents, and transactions of scientific societies. Many of
these works are scarce, some of them almost impossible to obtain.
The time and labour required to explore these various sources
would be greater than any one but an enthusiast could afford. It
is true that West has given an excellent condensed account of the
natives in his "History of Tasmania", but it is imperfect, and he
cites no authorities. Mr. Bonwick's two books "The Last of the
Tasmanians" and "The Daily Life of the Tasmanians", deserve more
than a passing mention. In these two works the author has
collected a great mass of information respecting the history and
customs of the aborigines. Every one must recognise the immense
service he has done in preserving so much that would otherwise
have been irretrievably lost. But excellent and valuable as is
the "Daily Life" as a popular and readable account of our native
tribes in their original state, it cites no authorities, and does
not pretend to strict scientific precision. Brough Smyth's
account is more critical, but it is meagre.</p>
<p>When, therefore, in 1890, Mr. H. Ling Roth published his work,
"The Aborigines of Tasmania", he did no inconsiderable service t
to anthropology. Mr. Roth devoted infinite pains to ransacking in
every likely corner, so as to gather together every scrap of
first-hand information, no matter how fragmentary, about the
aborigines. At the end of his book he gives a list of some 114
works, from which he has made extracts. These extracts he has
carefully digested and arranged according to subject, with
references to the original authorities in all cases. The result
is that the student has before him, in a carefully systematised
form, everything that is known about the Tasmanian Tribes, and
one's first feeling is one of surprise that so much information
could have been got together. The first edition was rapidly
exhausted, and soon commanded a greatly enhanced price. For the
last nine years Mr. Roth has been engaged in making further
inquiries and searches, and has, during that time, been able to
amass a considerable amount of new matter, and to correct a
number of defects in the book. He has now issued a new edition,
handsomely illustrated, and in it we have at last a complete
scientific account of our native tribes derived from the original
first-hand sources. The work is faithfully and conscientiously
done, and the book is in every respect an admirable one. It
throws a new light on the aborigines, and adds largely to our
knowledge of them, enabling us to fix more accurately than has
hitherto been possible, their place in the scale of humanity.</p>
<p>Mr. Roth's method of bringing together into a focus all the
various statements with respect to any one subject is of great
value, since it enables us to weigh these statements against each
other, and, in so doing, to reject not a little which is either
plainly erroneous or not supported by adequate, evidence. This
process of elimination has an interesting result. It tends to
strengthen our idea of the extraordinarily low state of
development which our Tasmanian natives had reached. We find that
in popular accounts they have been credited with a skill and
knowledge in various matters, which it is now well-nigh certain
they derived from contact with other races, and of which, in
their original condition, they were ignorant. Some instances may
be given of imported arts which Bonwick, West, and others, even
including such a cautious writer as Brough Smyth, have accepted
as originally known to the Tasmanians. I may mention the reputed
manufacture of ground stone implements, the use of handled
implements, of the womera or throwing stick, and of bone-pointed
or jagged spears, the making of different patterns of baskets,
the alleged use of the fire-drill, and the drawings attributed to
them. In all these matters the evidence collated by Mr. Roth goes
to show that any knowledge they may have had of these things was
acquired after they had come into contact with Australians or
Europeans.</p>
<p>Several of these errors in attributing to the Tasmanians
implements which they did not know in their native state have
arisen from the carelessness or ignorance of observers, some of
whom might have been expected to know better, notably G. A.
Robinson and Dr. Milligan.</p>
<p><i>Ground Stone Implements</i>.&mdash;This is a typical
instance, and will suffice to cover the whole ground of
implements distinctively Australian which have been attributed to
Tasmanians. In Dr. Barnard Davis's collection are three ground
stone implements labelled "Tasmania. (G. A. Robinson)". They were
presented by Robinson to Milligan, and by Milligan to Dr. Davis.
These are precisely of the kind used by the Australian blacks,
and Dr. Tylor has shown conclusively, in a paper read before the
British Association, that they were made either by Australians,
or by Tasmanians who had learnt the craft from them. The bringing
over about 1819 of the Sydney black "Mosquito" (who acted such a
mischievous part in leading our natives in their attacks on the
settlers), and also the introduction of a "tame mob" of Sydney
blacks in 1822, sufficiently accounts, says Dr. Tylor, for this
influence from the Mainland. The same influence accounts for
handled stone implements, bone-pointed and jagged spears, womera,
and various other Australian weapons which have been attributed
to the Tasmanians. It may be taken as conclusively proved that
the Tasmanians originally knew nothing of ground stone implements
belonging to the Neolithic Australians. As Tylor
remarks:&mdash;"The Tasmanians were undoubtedly at a low
pal&aelig;olithic stage, inferior to that of the Drift and Cave
men of Europe."</p>
<p><i>Baskets</i>.&mdash;In his first edition Mr. Roth figures
three patterns of baskets as made by the Tasmanians. One of
these, presented by Dr. Milligan to the British Museum, is of the
ordinary pattern of very simple construction, of which there are
several examples in our Museum, and which are undoubtedly
Tasmanian. The other two were presented by G. A. Robinson to Dr.
Davis. They are of different and more complicated patterns, and
of forms very common in Australia. Whereupon Mr. Roth remarks
that these baskets are doubtless Australian: that Robinson was
for some time protector of the aborigines in Victoria, and was so
unobservant that he did not distinguish between baskets of
Tasmanian and Victorian workmanship.</p>
<p><i>Mode of obtaining Fire</i>.&mdash;A more interesting
question, and one which must be considered as still open,
is&mdash;How did the Tasmanians obtain fire? The early voyagers,
seeing rough stone implements resembling flint at the camping
places, jumped to the conclusion that the natives obtained fire
by, percussion of flints. This supposed method may be dismissed
from consideration, and the question resolves itself into an
inquiry as to how they obtained fire by the usual savage method
of the friction of two pieces of wood. Mr. Roth, in his first
edition, figures a fire-drill (p. xi.) from a specimen labelled
as Tasmanian, and presented by Dr. Milligan to Dr. Davis. In the
second edition he figures two fire-drills, viz., the one
above-mentioned, and another presented by G. A. Robinson to Sir
John Lubbock. Now, H. R. Davis, who wrote a valuable paper on the
blacks, whom he knew after their captivity on Flinders, states
that he was informed that they used a drill for obtaining fire.
The drill method, in which a drill is rapidly revolved between
the hands, is in use among some Australian tribes, as it is, or
was, among the South African Bushman tribes, but there is no
direct evidence that it was ever known to the Tasmanians. There
is evidence, however, derived from the statements of early
settlers, that our blacks obtained fire by the friction of a
stick rubbed rapidly up and down a groove in another piece of
wood, in die fashion commonly practised in Polynesia. Mr. Roth
discusses the subject in an appendix, and inclines to the opinion
that probably the groove method was practised by the Tasmanians,
and that if the drill method was ever employed by them at all, it
was learnt from the Australians.</p>
<p><i>Drawings</i>.&mdash;P&eacute;ron, in the French expedition
of 1802, saw at Maria Island pieces of bark with marks like the
gashes which the blacks made on their bodies. Dr. Ross says that
at the Ouse he saw squares and circles cut on bark, which he,
with some probability, attributed to the blacks. Robinson told
Bonwick that on the West Coast, in 1831, he saw drawings of men
and women and curious hieroglyphics. West speaks of drawings on
bark representing a bullock team and cart, made by natives in the
North-West. This is apparently copied from Bunce, who states that
one of the V.D.L. Co.'s servants reported having seen such a
drawing on a bark hut or shelter of the natives. Calder, who is a
most reliable authority for anything which he says he himself
saw, in his account of a journey between Lake St. Clair and
Macquarie Harbour, in November, 1840, states that on Painter's
Plain, near the Surprise River, he found two native huts recently
abandoned, on the bark of which were some extraordinary drawings
in charcoal of men, kangaroo, dogs, and other figures. Also a
battle-piece&mdash;a native fight. (J.A.I., p. 21.) At first
sight this seems conclusive evidence, but, on turning back to the
previous day, we learn that he had then found several articles
which indicated that a runaway party of convicts from Macquarie
Harbour had passed that way. In any case these drawings were
found 40 years after the advent of Europeans. That the aborigines
in their wild state had any skill in drawing seems, therefore, to
hang on a very slender thread of evidence.</p>
<p><i>Canoes</i>.&mdash;The native canoes were formed of bundles
of bark lashed together with grass or vegetable fibre. Several
models of such canoes are preserved in our Museum. It is
generally stated in popular accounts, (and is quoted by Brough
Smyth) that they had also catamarans or rafts, formed of logs 30
feet long, and fastened by cross-pieces tied with bark. The only
authority for this statement is Jeffreys, who says that, with the
aid of paddles, they made these rafts skim over the water with
amazing rapidity. No one else mentions either paddles or
rafts.</p>
<p><i>Fish</i>.&mdash;Another point somewhat doubtful is whether
the blacks ever ate scaled fish. It is known, of course, that
shell-fish formed a considerable portion of their food at some
seasons, and that they had no hooks or nets, or other method of
catching fish, except spearing them. Lloyd says that they used to
spear stingrays for sport. Cook (i. 100) relates that when fish,
raw or cooked, was offered to them they rejected it. No remains
of fish have been found about their camps or in their shell
heaps. It seems more than probable that they never ate fish, but
any information on the point would be valuable.</p>
<p><i>Clothing</i>.&mdash;The chapter on aboriginal clothing is
very like the celebrated chapter on snakes in Iceland. The early
voyagers describe the aborigines as absolutely unclothed. It is
true that some of the women carried a kangaroo-skin slung across
their backs, but Cook (i. 101) thought that this was not for
clothing, but simply as a means of carrying an infant more
conveniently. After intercourse with Europeans, they used, at
times, to wear skins as a covering. It is certainly strange that
in a climate at times so severe as that of Tasmania, with a
plentiful supply of skins at hand, they had not learnt to use
them as a protection from the weather. That they never learnt to
sew skins together for clothing is one of the strongest proofs of
their low intelligence, and that they were on a lower plane than
the pal&aelig;olithic Drift and Cave men of Europe, who had bone
needles. Yet, though apparently so absolutely wanting in
originative or inventive faculty, they showed in their captivity
no want of intelligence or capacity to acquire such comparatively
difficult accomplishments as reading and writing.</p>
<p><i>Implements</i>.&mdash;There is probably still something to
be learned respecting the chipped stone implements of the
aborigines. It has usually been assumed that they were of one
general form, but I understand that Mr. J. P. Moir, of the Shot
Tower, has a number of concave scrapers, and also of gravers, to
which he gives the descriptive name of "duck bills". As these are
apparently of forms hitherto unrecognised, it would be
interesting to have them examined. A few weeks since I
accompanied Mr. R. M. Johnston and Mr. Morton on their
examination of a native quarry, which was discovered by Mr.
Harold Bisdee on the Hutton Park estate, near Melton Mowbray. We
found about an acre of ground covered with chippings of chert,
showing that it must have been for a very long period a place
resorted to by the aborigines for procuring their stone
implements. An interesting circumstance was that we found a
number of rounded nodules of greenstone (mostly broken), which
had evidently been used by the natives for splitting off the
flakes of chert, that were afterwards, by careful chipping,
shaped into stone axes. That the natives had stone implements
other than those commonly recognised as such, appears to be
highly probable. Mr. Norton Smith has described to me large
stones, discovered by him on the North-West Coast, which, in his
opinion, bore evidence of human handiwork, but for what purpose
they were shaped was doubtful. On our trip to Hutton Park Mr.
Bisdee showed us an interesting relic of the aborigines still
standing near Tedworth, Constitution Hill. This is a dead tree
which still bears the marks of the notches, which the black women
were accustomed to make to assist them in climbing for opossums.
I believe Mr. Morton intends to have this tree removed to the
Museum.</p>
<p><i>Origin</i>.&mdash;The question of the origin of the
Tasmanians is still an open one. They appeared to belong to the
most primeval races of mankind, and to be derived from the same
original stock as the Papuans and Melanesians. Indeed, it has
been suggested that from this primitive stock (perhaps resembling
the Mincopis of the Andaman Islands), both the Melanesians on the
one hand and the African negroes on the other, took their origin.
It is surmised that they reached Tasmania by way of Australia,
and that this pal&aelig;olithic, woolly-haired, negritic stock
once peopled the whole Australian Continent, until dispossessed,
and probably annihilated, by the present neolithic Australians,
characterised by their straight hair and the possession of ground
stone implements, the boomerang, throwing-stick, and shield. But
on this subject my friend, Mr. R. M. Johnston, may probably have
something to say.</p>
<p><i>Languages</i>.&mdash;In concluding these notes, I may
mention that an interesting feature in Mr. Ling Roth's book is a
full vocabulary of native words, reduced to a scientific method
of spelling, in place of the anomalous and absurd fashion of
spelling at present in vogue. It is to be hoped that Mr. Roth's
method will secure acceptance. I commend it to the notice of the
Lands Office.</p>
<p><i>Tribal Map</i>.&mdash;The book also contains a map, in
which the native names of places are shown in red, and an attempt
has been made to indicate the main tribal divisions. This is, of
course, to a certain extent, conjectural, but it is useful.</p>
<p>The main object I have had in view in writing these notes is
to get the members of the section to interest themselves in
obtaining from old settlers and others information respecting the
points referred to. That such an attempt is not hopeless, even at
the present time, I have reason to know. I recently obtained from
two old settlers some most interesting particulars respecting the
native method of obtaining fire, which go a long way towards
solving the question, and it is quite possible that further
inquiry in different parts of the Island would elicit more
information. I should like to see the section form a collection
of all the portraits of the Aborigines which are in existence.
Such a collection would be valuable and interesting, more
especially in years to come.</p>

<h3>THE CARTOGRAPHY OF THE TERRA AUSTRALIS AND NEW HOLLAND.</h3>
<p align="center"><small>BY JAMES B. WALKER</small></p>
<p><small>HOMER</small> represents the earth as a flat surface,
somewhat of the form of an oval shield, surrounded by the great
flowing salt river Oceanus, called by Milton "Ocean Stream". (See
map to Gladstone's "Juventus Mundi".) The knowledge of the
Ancients was almost wholly limited to the Mediterranean and its
shores, with some vague information as to the Red Sea and Persian
Gulf. Any ideas they had respecting the outer world were probably
derived from the Phoenicians, the most adventurous mariners of
those early ages. That they suspected the existence of a world
beyond the great encircling river is shown by Plato's description
in the "Tim&aelig;us" of the island of Atlantis, beyond the
Pillars of Hercules, and exceeding in size the whole of Africa
and Asia. I quote from Jowett's translation: "In those days the
Atlantic was navigable; and there was an island situated in front
of the straits which you call the Columbus of Hercules; the
island was larger than Libya and Asia put together, and was the
way to other islands, and from the islands you might pass to the
whole of the opposite continent which surrounded the true ocean.
Afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods, and in
a single day and night of rain, the island of Atlantis
disappeared and was sunk beneath the sea. And that is the reason
why the sea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable,
because there is such a quantity of shallow mud in the way, and
this was caused by the subsidence of the island."&mdash;Jowett's
Plato, ii. 521. Of more interest with respect to the Southern
Continent is a curious fragment from an old Greek writer of about
the same period, c. 350 <small>B.C.</small>, which has been preserved for us by
&AElig;lian, and which is quoted by Major in his "Early Voyages
to Terra Australis", p. iii. This writer, one Theopompus,
narrates a conversation between the god Silenus and King Midas of
Phrygia. "Silenus told Midas of certain islands, named Europe,
Asia, and Libya, which the Ocean Sea circumscribeth and
compasseth round about, and that without this world there is a
continent or parcel of dry land, which in greatness was infinite
and immeasurable; that it nourished and maintained, by the
benefit of the green meadows and pasture plots, sundry big and
mighty beasts; that the men which inhabit the same climate exceed
the stature of us twice, and yet the length of their life is not
equal to ours; that there be many and divers great cities,
manifold orders and trades of living; that their laws, statutes,
and ordinances are different, or rather clean contrary to ours."
It must not be supposed that the Greek philosophers of the age of
Plato and Theopompus still held Homer's opinion that the earth
was a flat surface. The Greek intellect had early arrived at a
true conception of the earth's form. Says Aristotle&mdash;"As to
the figure of the earth, it must necessarily be a sphere." He
estimated its circumference at 400,000 stadia. He further
remarks: "We may judge that those persons who connect the region
in the neighbourhood of the Pillars of Hercules with that towards
India, and who assert in this way that the sea is one, do not
assert things very improbable:" (Whewell, Hist. Ind. Sci. i.,
161.) We have the works of several Greek geographers before the
Christian era, of whom the best known is Strabo, who, in 17 books
gives a description of the whole known world. With the growth of
the Roman dominion, knowledge of the earth's surface was
necessarily largely extended. We have the result in the
celebrated geography of Ptolemy (130 <small>A.D.</small>) containing a very
careful typographical account of the various countries. His work
was illustrated by very tolerable maps, said to have been
executed by Agathodemon. It is perhaps to be regretted that
Ptolemy did not confine himself to known facts about the earth's
surface. Unfortunately, where knowledge was wanting, he filled up
with theory. Thus he abandoned the ancient idea of the
all-encircling ocean stream, and ventured on an assumption making
the Indian Ocean an inland sea like the Mediterranean, and
extending Africa on the south and Asia on the east, as continents
of immeasurable extent. Ptolemy was the last of the ancient
geographers, and for more than a thousand years he and his
theories held supreme sway in geographical matters. Some of these
theories respecting the unknown parts of the world had a
distinctly retarding effect on exploration, and were not disposed
of until the great era of maritime discovery in the 14th century.
During the Dark Middle Ages even Ptolemy was forgotten, and men's
ideas of geography grew chaotic. The flame of learning was kept
feebly alive in the great monasteries, but the monks despised
science, and devoted their care wholly to theological works. They
sometimes illustrated these works with a <i>mappamundi</i>
(<i>mappa</i>, a towel; <i>mundi</i>, of the world, as their maps
were usually drawn on linen). Such <i>mappae mundi</i> have been
preserved in MSS. of Beatus' Commentary on the Apocalypse (776
<small>A.D.</small>). A facsimile of one of these, the original of which was
drawn about the time of the Norman Conquest, will show what a
fantastic jumble was made by these monkish cartographers, who
grouped all the countries of the world haphazard round Jerusalem
as a centre. The first advance in geographical knowledge came
from the great religious movement which poured the hosts of
Europe into the East during the period of the Crusades&mdash;1095
to 1270&mdash;in the time of Wm. Rufus and Coeur de Lion down to
Edward I. Immediately following the Crusades came the era of land
travel, when Marco Polo, the Venetian, that prince of medieval
travellers, made his way (1277, temp., Edward I.) to the Court of
Kublai Khan in Pekin, and brought back to Europe marvellous tales
of far Cathay (China), Zipangu (Japan), India, of distant Java,
and the countries of the far East. Nearly a century later, in the
reign of our Edward <small>III</small>., say 1350, when the
mariner's compass came into use, and made distant voyages
possible, the era of ocean discovery began. In this the Genoese
captains led the way. These Genoese, disregarding the theories of
geographers, began to construct sea-charts&mdash;or as they
called them "portolani"&mdash;from their own observations, and
solely with a view to practical use in their voyages. It was then
that cartography first began to make substantial advances. From
1410 to 1460&mdash;in the time of King Henry V. down to the Wars
of the Roses&mdash;the Portuguese, under Prince Henry the
Navigator, courageously pushed their caravels out into the
mysterious Atlantic, called by the Arabian geographers the "Green
Sea of Darkness", in which the voyager was believed to be
swallowed up in impenetrable fogs. They dared to pass through the
tropic seas which, in the popular imagination, were always
boiling under the fierce rays of the vertical sun. So they crept
down the coast of Africa, and made the first step to the
discovery of the outer world. By the time of Prince Henry's death
(1460, contemporary with the Wars of the Roses) a cartographer,
like the Italian Fra Mauro, could construct a map (1457-59)
containing a fairly recognisable representation of Europe, Asia,
and Africa, surrounded by the ocean. Beyond this nothing was
known. It remained for Columbus, in the closing years of the
century&mdash;1492, temp. Henry <small>VII</small>.&mdash;to lift
the veil from the unknown and realise the ancient dream of a
mythical Atlantis, by his discovery of America. In the earlier
maps after Columbus we find the persistent influence of
traditional ideas. America is represented as an island closely
approaching China and India; whence the name West Indies.
Magellan's' voyage across the Pacific in 1521 (temp. Henry
<small>VIII</small>.), revolutionised men's ideas, and from that
time we find the cartographers depicting the world more or less
in accordance with our modern notions. Columbus had given to the
world a real America for the fabled Atlantis. The problem of the
Great Southland was longer in being solved. The ancient myth died
hard; in fact we find traces of it lingering for 300 years more,
down to near the close of last century. I do not propose to enter
on the thorny paths of the controversy respecting the earliest
indications of Australia, or to decide on the rival claims of
different nations. The subject has been fully discussed by Major,
Delmar Morgan, Collingridge, and others, and in their works full
information can be found. Suffice it to say, that somewhere
between 1514-42 (temp. Henry <small>VIII</small>. and Luther's
Reformation) the Portuguese, who had just discovered New Guinea,
almost certainly, while cruising in the Eastern Archipelago,
sighted some parts of the N.W. and possibly of the N.B. coasts of
Australia, and we find vague and inaccurate indications of their
discovery in maps about 1540. (The Royal Society has a fine
reproduction of these maps). If to the Portuguese belongs the
honour of having first sighted Australian shores, it is to the
Dutch, and to the Dutch alone, that the credit is due of its
actual discovery, <i>i.e</i>., if by discovery we mean a definite
knowledge of its position. The Dutch claims have been much
debated, and it has been sometimes asserted that their maps were,
for the most part, copied from the charts or descriptions of
Portuguese and Spanish navigators who had preceded them. Even
Tasman's right to the discovery of Tasmania has been doubted, and
he has been accused of appropriating Portuguese discoveries. But
of late years the Dutch claims have been abundantly vindicated by
the publication, not only of old maps, but of original journals
of discovery ships, which have been carefully treasured up in the
archives of the Dutch East India Co. It will, therefore, be
sufficient for our purpose, disregarding all other maps, to take
the works of the Dutch cartographers in order to show how the
mythical <i>Terra Australia Incognita</i> was displaced, and the
actual Southland&mdash;New Holland or Australia&mdash;was
gradually evolved in its place. It was during the 70 years war
with Spain, and on the eve of the rise of the Dutch Republic, the
period so graphically described in the pages of Motley, that the
Dutch first appeared as explorers of unknown countries. It was in
"the spacious times of great Elizabeth", when Cecil and
Walsingham seconded the efforts of Raleigh, Drake, Frobisher, and
other great seamen to establish England's sea-power, and lay the
foundations of her empire. But Holland was first in the field,
and at the first was more successful. Her ships were the most
numerous and the best, her seamen more skilful, her scientific
geographers more accomplished. At that time Holland was not only
the commercial, but also the intellectual, centre of Europe. As a
natural result of the extraordinary development of Dutch
commercial enterprise, there arose in Flanders, and also in
Holland, a great school of cartographers, of which Antwerp and
Amsterdam were successively the centres. The most celebrated of
these map makers, indeed the only one whose name is at all
familiar to English people, was the Flemish Gerhard Kremer,
better known by his Latinised name of Gerald Mercator. In 1541
Mercator produced his great globe, and in 1569 his great world
map. It is to Mercator and his friend Abraham Oertel (or
Ortelius) that we owe the first modern Atlas, both the thing
itself and the name. In 1570 (18 years before the Spanish Armada)
Ortelius brought out, at Amsterdam, his first Atlas. It was
called "<i>Theatrum Orbis Terrarum</i>" or "Spectacle of the
Countries of the Globe", and contained 53 maps. It was not until
near the end of the century, 1598, after the death of Mercator,
that the latter's Atlas was published at Amsterdam by his son, in
conjunction with Hondius. The work of Ortelius (increased in
later editions to 100 maps), and that of Mercator and Hondius,
were the first examples of the modern atlas. The name was derived
from the figure on the title-page of the giant Atlas supporting
on his shoulders a celestial globe. The construction of a world
map was by no means an easy task for these early cartographers to
accomplish to their satisfaction. (1.) The countries that had
been actually observed by competent navigators and travellers
they could lay down with a fair approach to accuracy; (2.) but in
the delineation of the more distant and less known countries they
were confronted by the difficulty due to uncertainty of
longitude, which there was no means of ascertaining with even
approximate accuracy. (3.) Then, the reasons vaguely indicated by
the inaccurate and often misleading descriptions of old
travellers, such as Marco Polo, had to be fitted in somewhere and
somehow. (4.) They were all more or less dominated by the fear of
deserting the traditionary ideas about what was absolutely
unknown. (5.) And, finally, they had a horror of blank spaces,
and liked to fill up the map, if only with something conjectural,
or, if that was not practicable, with strange figures of land
monsters, sea beasts, or (more innocently) of ships. The result
is often a strange jumble of fact and fancy. The Ortelius world
map of 1570, in the first edition of the atlas already mentioned,
is a fair example of this blending of knowledge and wild
conjecture. The unscientific character of the map is evident at a
glance. There is no attempt to distinguish by dotted lines or
otherwise, as is the practice of modern times, between the purely
conjectural and the known. The Arctic and the Antarctic regions,
the N.W. coast of North America (not explored until two centuries
later), the interior of Africa, are all laid down in as absolute
and definite lines as the shores of the Mediterranean. In the
delineation of the <i>Terra Australis Incognita</i> we have a
fine example of the method of the map-maker of the period. The
one point of actual knowledge is the Strait of Magellan, and that
side of the supposed Southland is, therefore, called "Magellanica
Regie" New Guinea is shown as a large, round Island, some 15 deg.
too far to the East, with a note that it is uncertain whether it
is an island or part of the Southern Continent, which is
accordingly extended so as nearly to touch it. The reported
discovery by the Portuguese of this Southern Continent in another
longitude is shown by a prolongation to the south of Java to
about the latitude of the Cambridge Gulf, but some 15 deg. too
far to the West, separated from Java by a strait called Lantch
idol Mare, (a misspelling of the Malay Laut Kidol, meaning "South
Sea"). This northern promontory bears the name "Beach" (on many
maps called "Regio Aurifera"), and also the words "Luach" and
"Maletur", with a statement that these extensive regions are
known from the writings of Marco Polo and others. The actual fact
being that the placing of the names is due to a misreading of M.
Polo, who describes under somewhat similar names parts of
Cambodia and the Malay Peninsula. Then, we have the remainder of
the Southern Ocean up to nearly lat. 40 deg. S. filled up with a
wholly imaginary continent called "Terra Australis Nondum
Cognita", with imaginary capes and promontories, such as "Regio
Psittacorum", the Land of Parrots, and so forth; while figures of
strange and fearful monsters occupy the blank spaces of the
ocean. Mr. Walker said that he had so far dealt with the mythical
period of the cartography, but he hoped in a future paper to deal
with the scientific period, and show the gradual development of
the coast line of New Holland.</p>
