  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">APART from numerous novels, most of which are accessible
  on-line at Project Gutenberg Australia and Roy Glashan's Library, Fred M.
  White published some 300 short stories. Many of these were written in the
  form of series about the same character or group of characters. PGA/RGL has
  already published e-book editions of those series currently available in
  digital form.</p>

  <p>The present 17-volume edition of e-books is the first attempt to offer the
  reader a more-or-less comprehensive collection of Fred M. White's other short
  stories. These were harvested from a wide range of Internet resources and
  have already been published individually at Project Gutenberg Australia, in
  many cases with digitally-enhanced illustrations from the original medium of
  publication.</p>

  <p>From the bibliographic information preceding each story, the reader will
  notice that many of them were extracted from newspapers published in
  Australia and New Zealand. Credit for preparing e-texts of these and numerous
  other stories included in this collection goes to Lyn and Maurie Mulcahy, who
  contributed them to PGA in the course of a long and on-going
  collaboration.</p>

  <p>The stories included in the present collection are presented
  chronologically according to the publication date of the medium from which
  they were extracted. Since the stories from Australia and New Zealand
  presumably made their first appearance in British or American periodicals,
  the order in which they are given here does not correspond to the actual
  order of first publication.</p>

  <p>This collection contains some 170 stories, but a lot more of Fred M.
  White's short fiction was still unobtainable at the time of compilation
  (March 2013). Information about the "missing stories" is given in a
  bibliographic note at the end of this volume. Perhaps they can be included in
  supplemental volumes at a later date.</p>

  <p>Good reading!</p>

  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1">1.&mdash;THE SUPERMAN</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY STEVEN SPURRIER</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XLVI, Jun 1917, pp
  65-70</h3><br>

  <p class="first">NOW, given a palm-fringed beach in the brilliant sunshine,
  or in the soft light of the moon, for that matter, with Nature in her most
  melting and expansive mood in the background, one of three things might
  conceivably happen. It might be that here the poet had come with the
  intention of writing another "Lalla Rookh," or maybe a master of colour might
  have come there with the idea of painting a great picture; and, on the other
  hand, the whole thing might be regarded as the background for an unusually
  attractive scene in musical comedy. It all depends upon the point of view and
  the mood that you happen to be in. And certainly the palm-fringed beach on
  the island of Granta, in the Coral Seas, might easily have been adapted for
  any of these purposes, as it lay there that placid night, with the full moon
  shining as per contract from a glorious tropical night, powdered with stars
  and scented with subtle fragrance. It lay there, with the creamy sea fringing
  the long stretch of dazzling sand, with the palm forest stretching inland,
  and the deep green hills in the background, a vision of perfect poetry and a
  glancing loveliness, far enough removed apparently from human strife, a
  glorious jewel dropped into the heart of a sapphire sea, and glowing softly
  and tenderly in the mellow amber light.</p>

  <p>So far there was no sign of the painter or the poet, and apparently the
  musical comedy suggestion was too remote to come within the range of
  practical politics. And yet presently, up the beach from the, lagoon on the
  left, there appeared a strange medley of human beings, as fantastic in that
  lonely spot as the figment of some amazing dream.</p>

  <p>They came in single file across the sands, about a dozen of them
  altogether, led by a little man in evening-dress and a typical British sailor
  in white ducks and a yachting cap. The little man was small and slender, pale
  of face and fair of hair, parted mathematically in the middle, a little man,
  who surveyed the amazing picture before him through an eyeglass, which only
  seemed to accentuate the innocent bewilderment of his features.</p>

  <p>The men in question were followed by a string of women, every one of them
  in evening-dress of the daintiest kind, Paris and Bond Street confections
  beyond the shadow of a doubt, lacy, diaphanous robes, that showed off
  gleaming arms and beautiful white necks to perfection, to say nothing of the
  perfect coruscations of jewels that shimmered alluringly in the moonlight.
  And here, therefore, was musical comedy <i>in excelsis</i>.</p>

  <p>But these were no stage beauties gathered together to dazzle the eyes of
  the stalls and appeal irresistibly to gilded youth lolling on cotton velvet.
  Neither were they such things as dreams are made of, but palpitating
  beautiful flesh-and-blood Englishwomen, that represented collectively some of
  the very best blood in the kingdom. There they were, dazzling and shimmering
  and, sad to say, clucking like so many startled hens. And in the language of
  George III., when meditating over the apple in the dumpling, the wonder was
  how the deuce they got there. What were they doing in their full war-paint at
  that time of night on what might or might not have been a desert island in
  the ruby heart of the Coral Seas?</p>

  <p>But everything is capable of an explanation&mdash;even musical
  comedy&mdash;and, as everybody knows, accidents will happen even in the
  best-regulated families. To go back a little while&mdash;a few months, as a
  matter of fact&mdash;the Duke of Grantham, that well-known sportsman, had
  married the only daughter of an American multi-millionaire, and on the
  strength of it had purchased the steam yacht <i>Bendemeer</i>, the very last
  word in luxurious ocean travel, and, at the end of his wife's first
  successful season in London, had set out on a voyage round the world,
  together with some of the choicest flowers culled from the garden of the
  British aristocracy. And in the course of time the <i>Bendemeer</i> had
  fetched up amongst a group of islands in the Coral Seas.</p>

  <p>And there, on the night when this veracious story opens, every man of the
  party, with one exception, had left the yacht with the idea of hunting
  jaguars on the nearest island in the moonlight. It had been a happy
  inspiration on the part of some reckless sportsman, and had been taken up
  with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"We shan't be more than an hour or two," the Duke had told the Duchess.
  "You can play bridge, or something of that kind, and we will leave Leckie to
  look after you. I don't suppose he feels like jaguars." The little pallid man
  in the eyeglass meekly responded that he didn't. He was no sportsman, or said
  he wasn't, and averred that the mere sight of a gun made him feel faint. He
  blinked at the Duke, and in his stammering way offered to take care of the
  ladies in the absence of the other men of the party. Whereat the women smiled
  audibly; for the idea of Bobby Leckie taking care of anything more festive
  than a rabbit struck them as being decidedly humorous. But Bobby Leckie took
  it all in good part and with a smiling good nature that rendered him a
  universal favourite even amongst sportsmen.</p>

  <p>He sat on the moon-washed deck presently, basking in the smile of beauty
  and dazzled by jewels, until a sudden idea occurred to him. He propounded it
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Tell you what," he said. "It's too fine to sit down there in the cabin
  playing bridge. Let's get out the steam pinnace and have a cruise round the
  islands. The moon will be up for hours yet, and the sea is like a sheet of
  glass. What do you people say?"</p>

  <p>The suggestion was acclaimed with enthusiasm, and under the guidance of a
  reliable pilot, who rejoiced in the name of Bill Bradley, the expedition set
  forth. It really was a glorious night, and the steam pinnace, which really
  was a big petrol launch, scattered the knots under her forefoot until the
  yacht was lost to sight, and the boat was careering her way through uncharted
  seas in the hands of the blissful Bill Bradley, who was absolutely
  unconscious of the danger that he was running. They came under the lee of the
  island of Granta presently, within a mile or so of the beach, when, without
  warning, the boat bumped heavily on a hidden reef and slipped clumsily off
  again.</p>

  <p>But the mischief was done, and it was only the speed of the motor boat
  that drove her up to the edge of the creaming sands before she began to fill,
  and the galaxy of beauty were safely landed. They were at least ten miles
  from the yacht on an unknown island, which might or might not have been
  inhabited, and they were naturally alarmed. Then, when the first feeling of
  fear had died away, they turned with one accord upon the unfortunate Leckie
  and tore him in pieces, figuratively.</p>

  <p>He took it placidly enough, with that imperturbable good temper of his,
  but nothing could disturb him.</p>

  <p>"Why blame me, dear girls?" he said. "I only made the suggestion. I didn't
  pile the boat up on a rock."</p>

  <p>"But what are we to do?" the Duchess screamed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't ask me," Leckie said. "We shall have to make the best of it
  till the men get back to the yacht and come out in search of us, which they
  are bound to do."</p>

  <p>"They'll never find us," a fair-haired beauty in mauve and emeralds
  sobbed. "There are about a thousand of these islands here, and it would
  probably take the whole British Navy the best part of a year to rescue us.
  And, besides, what can we do in these clothes?"</p>

  <p>"It's a warm night," Leckie stammered.</p>

  <p>"Of course it is, idiot, or we shouldn't be here," the Marchioness of
  Somerfield said sarcastically. "Now, Bobby, here's a chance to show what sort
  of a man you are. Do you think you could play the hero, like the man in
  Barrie's delightful comedy? Do you think you could make fire by rubbing two
  sticks together, or cook turtle's eggs in hot ashes, or find water by
  twiddling a stick between your fingers? Could you build us huts made of
  grass? Because, if you can't, you are worse than useless. Still, we rely upon
  you."</p>

  <p>"Dear lady, I c-couldn't," Leckie stammered forlornly. "If you gave me a
  t-turtle's egg, I shouldn't know what to do with the bally thing."</p>

  <p>He sat down forlornly on the sand and looked about him so helplessly that
  the rest of the party forgot their misery for the moment and beamed on him
  almost affectionately.</p>

  <p>"This reminds me of a toy theatre one of my brothers used to have," a girl
  in the party giggled. "He used to work it with pasteboard figures, and had a
  play, I think, called 'Alone in the Pirate's Lair.* Bobby, what on earth are
  we to do if the pirate suddenly appears from his lair?"</p>

  <p>Leckie shook his head helplessiy. The heroic was not his line, and he
  frankly said so. There were those amongst the party who had not forgotten the
  fact that Leckie had gone to America at the outbreak of the Boer War and had
  stayed there for the best part of ten years, and there were those of his
  candid friends who averred that he might have been doing better work in South
  Africa. But, on the other hand, there were certain comrades who declared that
  Bobby had been sent out to Colorado by a London physician, either to die
  there of acute lung trouble or, at any rate, prolong a monotonous existence.
  But on this head Bobby had always been dumb&mdash;no gibe or sneer had ever
  drawn an explanation from him. It was as if he wanted the incident to be
  forgotten, a chapter in his life that he was ashamed of. Perhaps he was
  feeling his helplessness now, for he sat there on the sands playing
  irresolutely with a cigarette case. The sprightly girl in pink returned to
  the charge.</p>

  <p>"Bobby, you haven't answered my question," she said. "What would you do
  for us if the pirate king appeared?"</p>

  <p>"You had b-better ask him yourself," Bobby said, "because, if I am not
  mistaken, here the bounder is!"</p>

  <p>There loomed across the sands in the moonlight a picturesque figure of a
  man in soiled white trousers and silk shirt, with a scarlet cummerbund round
  his waist, from which dangled a couple of holsters that palpably contained
  revolvers. He was a medium-sized man, with a black moustache and beard, and,
  indeed, he looked the musical comedy pirate to the life. He came forward and
  politely removed his cabbage hat.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen," he said in fairly good English.
  "What can I have the pleasure of doing for you? I am Don Jamie Rodgers, at
  your service."</p>

  <p>Something like a groan seemed to escape from Leckie's lips, and certainly
  his cheeks grew paler. For the name of Rodgers was well known to him as a
  desperado of the Coral Seas who had a score or more of black records to his
  name. He was a pirate, a pearl stealer, a smuggler of opium, and worse. And
  out there in those waters, where supervision was practically unknown, and the
  British Navy had no jurisdiction, certain scum of the earth did much as they
  liked, and amongst that scum there was none whose name carried more terror
  than that of Rodgers.</p>

  <p>Even as he stood there, leering with his malignant eyes on the huddled
  flower of the British aristocracy gathered together like so many frightened
  birds, he was appraising the jewels that they wore in that evil mind of his.
  Then Leckie rose to his feet and approached the rascal timidly.</p>

  <p>"Am I mistaken, sir," he asked, "or is that the mast of a wireless station
  I can see yonder?"</p>

  <p>"Something of the sort," Rodgers grinned. "A little installation of my
  own, but not a powerful one."</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps you'll l-let me have the l-loan of it?" Leckie asked.
  "I&mdash;I want to c-communicate with our friends over at Granta Bar. Our
  yacht is there. And if you'll h-help us to g-get in touch with them, I am
  sure that the Duke will make it worth your while. What d-d'you say?"</p>

  <p>Don Jamie beamed on the assembled company much as a giant might have
  beamed on a healthy gathering of young children destined to make him a hearty
  midday meal.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "so far as that goes, it seems to me that I shan't want
  to trouble the Duke. You see, it's like this, mister&mdash;I have got all I
  want hanging round the necks of those young women yonder. D'you savvy, old
  boss?"</p>

  <p>The old boss aforesaid savvied right enough&mdash;in fact, that is what he
  had been afraid of all along.</p>

  <p>"Y-you mean r-r-robbery?" he protested.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's as good a word as any other," the picturesque ruffian said
  cheerfully. "You see, when I tumbled just now to the fact that the stalls of
  the Garden Theatre in New York on an opera night had slopped itself all over
  this beach, it seemed to me as if it would have been flying in the face of
  Providence not to take the opportunity. And I don't mind telling you, pard,
  as me and my mates in the launch yonder have been having a pretty slim time
  lately, and when one of those American gunboats comes nosing around here,
  we've got to lie considerable close. And that's why I am going to borrow the
  few odds and ends belonging to them tony lady friends of yours."</p>

  <p>As the cheery ruffian spoke, three other men appeared on the scene from
  the direction of a launch lying a little way off the beach. They were not
  quite, perhaps, so picturesque as their leader, but they were by no means the
  class of individual that the cautious man cares to meet in a lonely lane on a
  dark night, and from the grin on their faces it was evident that they had
  taken in the situation at a glance. It was in vain that Bobby Leckie
  stammered and protested, in vain that he threatened subsequent violence, for
  presently the whole party were hustled along the sands without ceremony to a
  half-dismantled hut on the beach, above which stood the rugged mast to which
  the primitive wireless installation was attached.</p>

  <p>"Here, I say," Leckie said, " those l-louts of yours are frightening the
  ladies. They are afraid of those revolvers of yours. You might p-put them out
  of the way, because I and the other man are q-quite at your mercy."</p>

  <p>"Call <i>yourself</i> a man?" the pirate said. "That other chap's hefty
  enough, but you &mdash;gee whiz! Here, Joe, this chap calls himself a
  man!"</p>

  <p>The individual addressed as Joe grinned as he swept a bold, bleary eye
  over Leckie's slender proportions. He seemed to regard the joke as an
  excellent one. And so they went on in silence till they came to the hut,
  where the womenkind were swept without ceremony into a sort of stable in the
  basement, and Don Jamie, followed by his satellites, strode into the building
  where the wireless installation was situated. Evidently they seemed to have
  nothing to fear, for Leckie and the unhappy Bill Bradley brought up the rear,
  treading close on the heels of the man who had been addressed as Joe.</p>

  <p>"I wish I had a revolver," Bradley whispered.</p>

  <p>"S-so you will in a minute," Leckie replied. "K-keep close to me,
  Bill."</p>

  <p>A moment later and Leckie trod, either by accident or by design, on the
  heels of the big ruffian in front of him. The pirate turned with an oath and
  the upraising of a fist as big as a shoulder of miitton. The little man with
  the eyeglass appeared to step back, then suddenly impelled himself forward
  like a shot from a catapult, and his fist crashed with a jolt. full on the
  point of his Antagonist's jaw. It was just as if a small and delicate piece
  of machinery, with all the weight of a big horse-power engine behind it, had
  been set in motion, for the big man went down on his back without a sound. A
  second later his revolvers were in Leckie's hand, and one of them was
  promptly shoved into Bradley's ready fist.</p>

  <p>"Hands up, right away!" Leckie cried.</p>

  <p>He spoke in a clear voice, with a ring of command in it and without the
  slightest suggestion of a stammer. His glass was still in his eye, but those
  pale features of his were set as grim as death, and the finger that he laid
  on the trigger of the revolver was steady as a rock. He seemed to have
  expanded as he stood there, quiet and immaculate, in his evening-dress, with
  the moonlight gleaming on the pearl studs in his shirt-front. Don Jamie
  turned and surveyed the scene with astonishment and a certain amused
  contempt.</p>

  <p>"Here, drop that!" he cried. "Think yourself a hero in some stage play,
  perhaps. Oh, well, if you will have it, you little fool&mdash; why, you
  must!"</p>

  <p>He whipped his hand behind him, and at the same moment Leckie pressed the
  trigger of his revolver. There was a little crack like a whiplash, a tiny
  spurt of flame, and the big man's right arm dangled helplessly at his side,
  for Leckie had shot him neatly and scientifically through the elbow
  joint.</p>

  <p>"The next man who moves will get it through the brain," he said, in the
  same calm, even voice. "Now, I don't want to cause any more trouble than is
  possible, and I don't like murder, even when it comes to swine like you. Don
  Jamie, or whatever you call yourself, kindly step this way."</p>

  <p>There was no help for it, there was nothing else to be done. The
  scoundrels were caught neatly enough in the little trap that Leckie had laid
  for them, and they were looking now quite uneasily into the rim of a pair of
  revolvers. With a scowl on his face and a muttered curse between his lips,
  the leader of the gang did as he was told.</p>

  <p>"Now, then," Leckie said, "listen to me, if you please. You are not going
  to frighten those ladies any more, and you are not going to benefit by what a
  distinguished English statesman once called unearned increment. You will be
  good enough to send out a message for me to the <i>Bendemeer</i>, which you
  probably know is lying not very far off, and tell them on the yacht that we
  are safe. You will also tell them that you have been kind enough to place
  your launch at our disposal, of which offer we shall avail ourselves
  presently, and I have no doubt you will know how to get it back again. But
  that, my dear sir, will be your business. Have I made myself plain?"</p>

  <p>Don Jamie nodded sulkily. Then a queer gleam flickered in his eye for a
  moment or two.</p>

  <p>"Ah, I have thought of that!" Leckie said. "I see what is passing through
  your mind. But my friend, Mr. Bill Bradley here, will see to it that you send
  the correct message. He happens to be the handy-man of the yacht and,
  incidentally, the understudy of our wireless operator. He is also a man of
  exceedingly short temper, as humorists often are, and, if you try to fool
  him, you will probably be exceedingly sorry for it. Bill, you kindly escort
  this gentleman into the operating-room, and do the needful, keeping a careful
  eye on him at the same time. As he still has the use of his left hand, I
  should leave him to send the message. Now, you go on, and I will remain here
  and collect the rest of the weapons."</p>

  <p>Bill Bradley grinned whole-heartedly, as a man does who is convinced that
  he has the best end of the joke, and, driving Don Jamie before him at the
  point of his revolver, disappeared into the hut. Leckie turned to the other
  men.</p>

  <p>"Now, then," he said, "turn your backs on me and throw your guns in my
  direction over your shoulders. Thanks so much. So sorry to put you to the
  inconvenience. And now, having placed temptation beyond your reach, I am
  going to turn the key of this door on you, and sit here, enjoying a cigarette
  and contemplating the beauties of Nature, and if either of you try any little
  game on me, I fear that you will find the consequences exceedingly
  unpleasant."</p>

  <p>Leckie sat there, in the tranquil enjoyment of his cigarette, and,
  perhaps, pleasantly conscious that the ladies, who were not far away, could
  see and hear all that had taken place. And this knowledge was not displeasing
  to him, especially when the fair-haired girl in mauve crept up to him
  presently and turned a pair of dazzling and admiring eyes upon him.</p>

  <p>"Bobby," she whispered, "you are splendid! I really had no idea&mdash;I
  really hadn't. And I hope you will forgive me for laughing at you. Really,
  Bobby, if you look at me like that again, I shall have to k-kiss you!"</p>

  <p>"I am quite defenceless," Bobby said blissfully. "R-rather bo kissed by
  you than anybody in the world."</p>

  <p>It was fortunate, perhaps, at this moment that Mr. Bradley emerged from
  the hut with an intimation that the message had been sent and a reply
  received. Then, under the leadership of Leckie, the party went slowly in the
  direction of the beach, headed by the smiling boatswain and Don Jamie, who
  was thoughtfully prodded from time to time in the region of the liver by the
  point of the commandeered revolver. One by one the ladies were conveyed to
  the launch, and presently Leckie stood alone on the fringe of sand with the
  pirate chief, who regarded him with a mixture of concentrated rage and
  bewildered admiration.</p>

  <p>"Well, you're a fair knock-out, you are," he said. "And me thinking all
  the time that you were no better than a scared jack-rabbit! Well, you can go
  back to your friends and boast that you are the first man who ever got the
  better of Jamie Rodgers. And that's a fact&mdash;yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Really?" Lepkie drawled. "Is that so? But I'm not worrying about it. Do
  you know, Mr. Rodgers, I hate getting my feet wet. And yet I don't see how I
  am going to get into that launch without ruining a pair of Court shoes and
  some silk socks that cost me a guinea in Bond Street. That's what's troubling
  me at the present moment. I give you my word of honour that I am not thinking
  about you at all."</p>

  <p>In spite of his abject humiliation and the excruciating pain in his arm,
  Rodgers burst into a laugh.</p>

        title="'Well, I guess you're some boy,' he said.">

  <p>"Well, I guess you're some boy," he said. "And I don't bear no malice.
  You've fairly held me up, and if I'd known&mdash;but, you see, I didn't. Say,
  stranger, ten or twelve years ago, before I started this game, I was up on
  the Yukon, gold prospecting with the very toughest crowd on the American
  Continent. There wasn't a crime in the, calendar that those boys weren't up
  to. But there was one chap, an Englishman, come up there, who was a fair
  terror to the whole bunch. I never saw him myself, but I heard of him often
  enough. From all accounts he was a little chap, about your size, an English
  swell, the boys said, as nobody could down. He wasn't a tough; he had an idea
  that he had come there to straighten matters out and turn the Yukon into a
  civilised community. It was some proposition, but he did his best to put the
  programme through&mdash;him without an ounce of strength, and weighing about
  a hundred and fifty pounds! They used to say he had come to America to die of
  some chest trouble, but decided to live and reform the States instead. Why,
  he'd go into the saloon amongst the toughs, with his glass in his eye and a
  revolver in his hand, and clear out the whole caboodle within five
  minutes."</p>

  <p>"What was his name?" Leckie drawled. "Well, I don't rightly know, but I
  think the boys called him 'Little Billee with the Glass Eye.' Say, mister, I
  guess you must have been that man."</p>

  <p>"I guess I was," Leckie said sweetly.</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY FRANK GILLETT</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XLVI, Jul 1917, pp
  137-142</h3>

  <p class="first">LORD RAYBURN turned the letter over in his hand, and a smile
  crept into those piercing eyes of his, for the great scientist permitted
  himself to be pleased.</p>

  <p>"Now, this is a remarkable thing, Hayter," he said to his chief assistant.
  "Here is actually a letter from my great antagonist, Miguel del Viantes. He
  proposes to come and see me. I take it that this is an admission that all
  these years he has been attacking me unjustly."</p>

  <p>George Hayter smiled behind his hand. He was well acquainted with the
  jealousies and bitter bickerings of scientists the world over, and there was
  not anywhere a scientist who was not aware of the deadly rivalry between Lord
  Rayburn and the eminent Spaniard. The fact that they had never met, and that
  they did not even know one another by sight, made little difference.
  Therefore Hayter listened discreetly.</p>

  <p>"He wants to come and see me," the great man went on. "He says he is going
  to South America on an experimental mission, of which, of course, he says
  nothing, but he hints that possibly he may not return. It is his way of
  holding out the olive branch, I suppose. Anyway, he wants to see me, and,
  unless I wire him to the contrary, he will motor down here this afternoon. As
  the visit is entirely private&mdash;you will understand why he doesn't want
  people to know he has been here&mdash;you had better arrange for him to leave
  his car in the lane at the end of the shrubbery, and come here across the
  garden, through the conservatory. As he drives his own car, this should be
  easily managed. Then you can bring him here, and leave us alone together. You
  had better take the afternoon off, and come back about five o'clock. I am
  relying on your discretion, Hayter."</p>

  <p>"Of course," Hayter murmured. "Does Del Viantes say what he is coming
  for?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes. He is deeply interested in those freezing experiments of mine.
  I gather that he particularly wants to have a look at the diamond that we are
  experimenting upon. But he does not say any more than that."</p>

  <p>Hayter gave the desired assurance and vanished, leaving the great
  scientist to his own not unpleasant thoughts. This business was, in a way,
  the crowning glory of his career. It was soothing to his vanity to know that
  the great rival whom he had never seen was voluntarily seeking his
  advice&mdash;the advice of the man whom he had been attacking in the
  scientific press for years. The mere fact that the Spaniard was coming down
  to Tulham Place secretly made little or no difference.</p>

  <p>So the pleased smile was still on Rayburn's face as he turned his back
  upon the laboratory and walked into the conservatory beyond. Both these
  buildings jutted out from the side of the house on to a sloping bank which
  led to a famous rose-garden, and the foundation consisted of a series of
  tanks and vaults, specially constructed, and something like a huge aquarium,
  in which Rayburn's freezing experiments were constantly going on. For Rayburn
  was a rich man, the head of an old family, and, apart from the estate, which
  would go elsewhere when he died, had a small fortune of his own, which he
  spent on his research work. And this small fortune would some day pass to his
  confidential assistant, George Hayter.</p>

  <p>But Rayburn was thinking nothing of that at the moment. He wandered round
  the conservatory amongst his magnificent collection of orchids, of which he
  was, perhaps, more proud than of his scientific discoveries. He had an almost
  passionate love for those glorious blooms, and every hour he could spare from
  his life's work he spent amongst them.</p>

  <p>He was still wandering, like some gigantic bee, from flower to flower,
  when a couple of hours later the far door of the conservatory opened, and
  from the concrete roofs beyond, which were approached by a flight of steps,
  Hayter appeared with a tall, thin, foreign-looking man in his wake. The
  stranger came forward with a smile behind his gold-rimmed glasses, and held
  out a thin, brown hand.</p>

  <p>"May I have the honour, my lord?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, certainly, certainly," said the flattered Rayburn. "This is an
  historic meeting, Señor Viantes. I quite appreciate the broad spirit that
  brought you here, and I am only too delighted to ignore the past in the
  interests of our mistress, the Goddess of Science. Yes, I think you can go,
  Hayter. I don't think the señor and myself are likely to come to blows."</p>

  <p>Hayter discreetly smiled and vanished. With his best manner Rayburn turned
  to his visitor. He was a very great gentleman, and, when he chose, his manner
  was as irreproachable as his scientific knowledge.</p>

  <p>"I bid you welcome, señor," he said, "and I do hope you are in no great
  hurry."</p>

  <p>"I sail to-morrow," Del Viantes explained.</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed. I trust that, at any rate, you can give me an hour or two.
  Now, are these flowers anything in your line? I am very proud of my
  orchids&mdash;in fact, I think I value them more than any possession I have.
  Every moment of my spare time is occupied in here. There is not a collector
  in the world who does not write to me when he has found anything new&mdash;at
  least, amongst the class of orchids in which I am interested."</p>

  <p>"They are rarely beautiful," Viantes said, with a touch of real
  enthusiasm. "It is a charming hobby, and I can quite understand how it
  fascinates you. But, alas, I am a poor man, and have no money to spend on
  anything. But that plant over yonder is extraordinarily beautiful."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you have hit upon the gem of my collection; you have a real eye for
  the beautiful. Now, this is an orchid of the class <i>Gynandria
  Monandria</i>. That is a marsh orchid from South Africa, and the only one of
  its kind yet discovered. I prefer them to the <i>epiphytes</i>, exquisite as
  they are. And "that, of course, is a <i>cypripedium</i>.'"</p>

  <p>As Rayburn spoke, he laid his hand almost lovingly on a long spike of
  bloom that shot upwards a foot or more in height in a series of shaded mauve
  blossoms with centres and cups graded away to the hue of virgin gold. The
  exquisite mass clung to the stem and trembled like a cloud of butterflies.
  Over it Rayburn hung with the rapt adoration of a mother bending over the
  cradle of her child.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you can understand my enthusiasm," he said. "These blooms are
  almost sacred to me. Ah!"</p>

  <p>As Rayburn spoke, his foot seemed to slip on the damp tiles of the
  conservatory, and as he jerked forward he touched the stem of the plant, and
  the topmost spray of blossoms broke off as if they had been severed with a
  knife. He whitened, with an expression almost of pain on his face, then
  recovered himself and forced a smile to his lips.</p>

  <p>"Take that little spray," he said, "and put it in your buttonhole as a
  memento of the occasion. But I would not willingly have done that to oblige
  an emperor."</p>

  <p>Viantes slipped the spray into his buttonhole and followed his host
  through the laboratory.</p>

  <p>"Pray be seated," Rayburn said. "We have an hour or two before us, and are
  not in the least likely to be interrupted&mdash;in fact, I have respected
  your wishes to the letter. As you suggested, not a soul knows you are here,
  except my assistant, and I have sent him off for the afternoon. Your little
  car is in the lane, I presume, and nobody is likely to notice it
  there&mdash;in fact, the lane leads to nowhere, and is hardly used once a
  month&mdash;and therefore this meeting is as secret as it can be. I am not
  likely to mention it, unless you give me permission to do so, though perhaps
  some day this meeting may be historic. But that is for you to say,
  señor."</p>

  <p>"I am profoundly grateful," Viantes murmured. "How deeply grateful I
  cannot say in words, but I think my presence here is a practical expression
  of my confidence."</p>

  <p>"The feeling is mutual," Rayburn smiled. "And now pray tell me what I can
  do for you?"</p>

  <p>The Spaniard hesitated just for a moment. "To be quite candid, my lord,"
  he said, "I came down here consumed with curiosity to see that diamond which
  I understand you are experimenting upon. It is no secret, of course, because
  the scientific papers have been discussing it for weeks. Am I to understand
  that you claim to remove a flaw in a superimposed diamond by freezing it so
  many degrees below zero?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I think so," Rayburn said cautiously. "But I am not far enough in
  my experiments yet to speak with any confidence. Still, I have seen enough to
  encourage me."</p>

  <p>"It is a very valuable stone, I presume."</p>

  <p>"Very," Ray burn said&mdash;"a matter of twenty thousand pounds, I
  suppose. If I succeed, it will be worth at least three times as much, and if
  I fail, no harm is done."</p>

  <p>"But," Viantes suggested, "you might damage it. It might fly into a
  thousand fragments if it was subjected to a very intense cold. What of that,
  my lord?"</p>

  <p>"Then, in that case, I shall be the loser," Rayburn smiled. "I should have
  to find that sum of money, which, between ourselves, would absorb my private
  means, because, when I die, this place of mine and my income must go to my
  successor. And my assistant would be all the poorer, which would be very hard
  upon him, seeing that he knows of my intentions, and that he is going to be
  married very shortly."</p>

  <p>As Rayburn finished, he rose to his feet and, unlocking a drawer in his
  writing-desk, produced a great diamond. It was a magnificent stone, and as it
  lay winking and sparkling on the table, Viantes' eyes narrowed behind his
  spectacles, and his mouth quivered like that of a cat stalking a bird.</p>

  <p>"A wonderful gem!" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Yes, a royal gem. Now, it was lent to me by a firm of Court jewellers for
  the purpose of my experiment. You must understand that it is what is called a
  superimposed stone&mdash;that is, two layers placed one upon another, and
  joined by spirit gum or something of that kind, much as they join a series of
  glasses from which telescopic lenses are ground. Originally the diamond was
  much bigger; but it met with an accident&mdash; a fracture in the
  centre&mdash;so that it was necessary to split the stone in two and join it
  up again. Of course, this detracted from the value, but only an expert could
  tell and discern the tiny spot of moisture that was created in the process.
  Now, my idea, as you know, is literally to burn out that moisture by frost,
  and therefore, in one of my tanks which lie out yonder beyond the
  conservatory, I propose to subject the stone to a freezing process a hundred
  degrees below zero; and when that is done, I am sanguine that the flaw will
  have vanished. If you have another half-hour or so to spare&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The sentence was never finished, for the Spaniard was on to Rayburn like a
  flash, as the latter bent over the table, a knife gleamed in the air, and the
  great man collapsed to the floor, stricken between the shoulders to the
  heart, and lay there dead without a single sound.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>It was nearly six o'clock before Hayter, feeling a little uneasy, knocked
  at the laboratory door without receiving any reply. He flew round to the back
  of the house, with the idea of approaching the laboratory by a flight of
  steps leading up to the big tanks with their concrete tops. The motor-car in
  the lane had disappeared, and this only added to Hayter's uneasiness. It was
  nearly dark now, so that Hayter noticed nothing except that the lid over the
  manhole of one of the great freezing tanks had not been slipped back, and
  this he hastily readjusted.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I am to blame for that," he murmured. "Well, it doesn't so very
  much matter."</p>

  <p>Just by the conservatory door lay a spray of three or four blooms of the
  priceless <i>Gynandria Monandria</i>. Hayter stooped and mechanically placed
  it in his buttonhole.</p>

  <p>"Now, how did that precious treasure get here?" he asked himself. "Lord
  Rayburn would as soon have cut off his own hand as given away one of those
  beloved children of his."</p>

  <p>He forced the catch on the conservatory door and hastened into the
  laboratory. A moment later he was bending over the dead body of his chief
  with that calm, self-centred feeling that comes to most of us in the presence
  of sudden and unexpected death. There were certain things to be done, and
  Hayter went about them quite methodically. Then his eye caught sight of the
  open drawer with the key still in it, and with a strange suspicion in his
  mind he searched in the little cotton-wool nest for the big diamond which
  ought to have been there.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later he had aroused the household and was holding Scotland
  Yard at the other end of the telephone, and barely half an hour afterwards he
  was telling his story to an inspector of police.</p>

  <p>"Let me have that again, Mr. Hayter," Inspector Jones said. "I want to be
  quite clear. Señor Viantes came down here, at his own suggestion, to meet a
  man who has been his greatest enemy for the last twenty years."</p>

  <p>"You have seen the letter," Hayter said curtly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. Now, what sort of a man is this Spanish scientist? As mad as
  most of them, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Madmen don't steal historic diamonds," Hajter said. "I don't want to
  teach you your business, Inspector, but that man stole the diamond, and
  probably at the same time dropped the spray of orchid which I have in my
  buttonhole, and which I picked up, as I told you, outside the conservatory
  door when I was forcing it. To my mind, the thing is quite plain. Lord
  Kayburn has been murdered, and the murderer escaped in his car, which he
  brought down here alone for the purpose of getting away quickly. Now, it
  seems to me that it is up to you to go back to London and interview Señor
  Viantes without the slightest delay. That is my opinion."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right," the Inspector conceded. "And as you saw the
  Spaniard, you had better come along."</p>

  <p>It was quite late in the evening before Hayter and Inspector Jones found
  themselves in Bloomsbury, face to face with the Spanish scientist in the
  latter's sitting-room. But directly Hayter entered the room his face
  fell.</p>

  <p>"There is some mistake here, I am afraid," he murmured. "If this is Señor
  Viantes, then I have never seen him before. It was not he who called upon
  Lord Rayburn."</p>

  <p>"That is very good of you, sir," said the slight man with the piercing
  grey eyes who stood confronting his intruder. "A policeman was here just now
  who refused to believe my identity. I am Miguel del Viantes, as I can bring a
  dozen people to prove, and I have been in London all day. Do you think I
  would stoop to go near Lord Rayburn? A clever man, no doubt, but a humbug,
  sir, and a good bit of a charlatan."</p>

  <p>"I don't think we need go into that," Hayter said coolly. "And you, sir,
  are prejudiced, in any case. Still, Lord Rayburn has been murdered and robbed
  of a valuable diamond, and as you are apparently the gentleman you claim to
  be, we are wasting our time here. What do you say. Inspector?"</p>

  <p>There was no more to be said, and nothing to be done but to make as
  graceful an exit as possible and lose no time in seeking a clue
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>But the days went on till a month had elapsed, and no trace had been found
  of the clever criminal who had so cunningly made use of the Spaniard to
  commit a successful crime and get away clearly with his prize. And it was by
  no means a pleasant month for Hayter, either. He was cognisant of the fact
  that he was being dogged and watched, and there were many signs that the
  police held him under suspicion.</p>

  <p>For practically everything depended upon his uncorroborated testimony.
  Nobody had seen the murderer but himself, no one had ever seen the slightest
  trace of the car, and as to the letter which the Spaniard was supposed to
  have written, that might easily have been forged by anybody. And, again, the
  diamond had vanished. It would take all the dead man's fortune to make the
  loss of it good, so that all Hayter's dreams of a happy and comfortable
  marriage had vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>Still, he was allowed to go on with his research work at Tulham Place,
  and, indeed, he had had more than one plain hint to the effect that he had
  better stay there for the present. Inspector Jones had been mightily curious
  on the subject of what he called the clue of the broken orchid, coupled with
  the fact that the body of Rayburn had been found by his chief assistant, who
  had also discovered the fact that the diamond was missing.</p>

  <p>And so matters drifted on till the end of November without the slightest
  clue to the identity of the real culprit. Who he was, and whence he came, no
  one knew, though Del Viantes had hinted vaguely at a foreign assistant who
  had been in his employ for some little time, and had been discharged for
  flagrant dishonesty.</p>

  <p>It was a fine morning at the end of November when Hayter was interrupted
  in the laboratory by the entrance of one of his mechanics.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to trouble you, sir," he said, "but aren't you going to open Number
  Three Tank to-day? It's been frozen for the last three months at two hundred
  below zero, and that bacteria must be ready now. Shall I get on with it,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you had better," Hayter said languidly. "Draw the slide back from
  the roof and take the iron shutters down from the front pf the tank. Let the
  light play on it as much as possible. I'll come along presently."</p>

  <p>The assistant vanished only to return, a quarter of an hour later, with
  starting eyes and a peculiar green tinge on his cheeks that spoke of some
  unreasoning terror. He clutched Hayter by the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake, come along with me, sir!" he said hoarsely. "No, sir,
  there's nothing wrong with the big tank, but when you see what is inside it
  "</p>

  <p>The slide on the top of the tank that flanked the outer door of the
  conservatory and the iron shutters had been removed. Now that the light shooe
  through the roof, and the sunshine glittered on the specially prepared glass
  front, the ten-thousand-gallon tank revealed itself in the shape of a huge
  block of ice as clear as crystal.</p>

  <p>But Hayter was not thinking of that&mdash;he was gazing with protruding
  eyes and a strange creeping of his spine at an object crystalised in the
  centre of the ice. It was a human form with hands upraised and grey face
  congealed into an expression of terror that seemed alive and appealing mutely
  for assistance. Every limb and feature was as clear as it had been months
  ago, when the sham Del Viantes, hastening away from Tulham Place, had stepped
  in the gloom over the open trap-door that Hayter had left, and had thus gone
  unconsciously to his doom. The weight of his body, no doubt, had carried him
  through the upper crust of the ice in an early stage of its formation, and
  his feet had evidently stuck in the foot or so of gelatine at the bottom of
  the tank.</p>

  <p><a id="pic2"
     name="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1301061h-images/BelowZero.jpg"
         title="It was a human form with hands upraised.">
  </div>

  <p>The man had been dead all these months, without the shadow of a doubt. He
  looked hideously and repulsively alive as he stood there, like a chrysalis in
  the centre of a transparent cocoon. Even a spray of orchids in his buttonhole
  retained their freshness and the delicate shades of mauve and gold.</p>

  <p>"Well, I have had some curious experiences in my time," Inspector Jones
  said, an hour or two later, in somewhat shaky tones, as he stood before the
  unshuttered tank. "And, anyhow, it's all pretty plain now. Very likely his
  lordship gave a spray of his orchids to the man who murdered him, and the
  fellow, in his haste to get away, blundered into the tank. I shall be greatly
  surprised if we don't put our hands on the diamond, too, before we are
  through with this business."</p>

  <p>It was nearly twelve o'clock the following day before the conditions were
  favourable for the removal of the unknown murderer from the tank, after which
  the body was laid on the table in the laboratory. It was Inspector Jones's
  unpleasant task to go over it in search of the missing treasure, the finding
  of which would establish Hayter's innocence beyond all doubt. But for a long
  time there was no sign of the stone, till the Inspector removed the spray of
  orchids from the dead man's buttonhole.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful how they keep their freshness, isn't it?" he asked. "Some time
  ago I saw a bouquet of flowers that had come all the way from Australia
  frozen in a block of ice, and they might have been picked the day before.
  Hullo, here we are!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the Inspector turned over the spray in his hand, and with a
  grunt of satisfaction plunged his little finger into the centre of one of the
  deep cups, and displayed a small round object carefully wrapped in
  cotton-wool.</p>

  <p>"The missing stone," he exclaimed, "beyond the shadow of a doubt. I am
  glad to have my hands on this, Mr. Hayter, for your sake, because, you
  see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," Hayter said grimly. "You needn't say any more about that.
  The man lying there, whoever he is, came down in a little two-seater car. He
  came alone, because I met him in the lane. What became of the car?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that puzzled me, too," Jones admitted. "But, of course, the fellow
  had a confederate. That sort of robbery was too big a thing for one man.
  Probably the confederate loitered about till he got alarmed, and went off to
  save his own skin, as such men always do. But really it doesn't matter. To
  prove the identity of this criminal will be another question altogether.
  Personally, I don't believe it ever will be proved."</p>

  <p>And, as usual, Inspector Jones was right.</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY DUDLEY TENNANT</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XLVI, Aug 1917, pp
  317-323</h3>

  <p class="first">WHAT Stephen Fox particularly wanted to impress upon
  Geraldine Benson was the fact that, although a man knows very little about a
  horse, it does not necessarily follow that he is an ass. And this is a point
  of view that the enthusiastic admirer of the equine race finds it exceedingly
  difficult to understand. To the sportsman who confines himself to man's best
  friend there is no other point of view and no other branch of
  athletics&mdash;the rest are merely a waste of time. This point of view,
  probably, had never occurred to the somewhat spoilt and wilful beauty who
  presided occasionally over the destinies of her father's big ranch in Texas.
  That is to say, when she was not in New York, or at Orange Beach, or in
  Paris, she was at home generally in her riding habit, and usually astride of
  a horse that was worth anything up to ten thousand dollars.</p>

  <p>Old man Benson, like most American fathers, utterly spoilt his daughter,
  which was quite natural, seeing that she was his only child, and old man
  Benson was by far the richest man in that part of the world. In the language
  of the boys, he was "no slouch," either as a man of business or as a man of
  the world. Neither was he the typical Western farmer to whom the pictures
  have accustomed us, for he represented the third generation, and was a very
  cultured gentleman indeed. All sorts of people came to the ranch from all
  parts of the world, and the hospitable owner of the estate was always glad to
  see them, especially when his daughter was at home to share the honours of
  the house, and this was usual in the autumn, before Geraldine proceeded to
  Orange Beach with the rest of the fashionable world.</p>

  <p>And so it came about that Stephen Fox happened along in due course, and
  put in a whole month at the ranch. He came for two reasons&mdash;first,
  because he had a letter of introduction from a famous English statesman, and,
  secondly, because he had met Geraldine in New York, where he had made up his
  mind to induce her to change her name as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>He was a young man of good family enough&mdash;a fine specimen of the
  English athlete, neat and trim, perfectly self-assured, and, withal, modest
  enough, but unfortunately he knew little of horses, and cared less. It so
  happened that certain family misfortunes had tied him somewhat largely to
  town life, until chance smiled on him, and he found himself, at twenty-five,
  in possession of a fine family estate. But if he knew nothing about horses,
  he was quite at home with every other branch of sport, and he was a
  magnificent shot with rifle and revolver, and there was no man whose
  reputation stood higher with the Alpine Club.</p>

  <p>It was, perhaps, a mistake on the young man's part to follow that wilful
  young woman to her native heath. She liked him &mdash;in fact, she liked him
  immensely&mdash;but then he was only one of a large and enthusiastic crowd,
  all equally anxious to lay siege to the Benson dollars; and, whatever her
  faults were, Geraldine Benson was no fool. Emphatically she was not going to
  marry any man who was after her fortune. She knew, of course, that Fox was
  fairly well off&mdash;that is, comparatively speaking&mdash;which was in his
  favour, and when he appeared she was pleased enough to see him. She was
  living just then in the open air, leading a healthy, simple life in
  connection with a magnificent black horse that she managed to perfection,
  though it seemed to Fox that she was running unnecessary risks with a mount
  that would have been too much for many a man who had been brought up all his
  life in the vicinity of a stable. But Geraldine only laughed and made fun of
  Fox's fears. She could not induce him to mount anything more formidable than
  a farm filly; and when once he had made something of an exhibition of himself
  in connection with a splendid three-year-old, she showed her open
  contempt.</p>

  <p>It seemed to her that Fox was actually afraid. She could see that he had
  lost something of his healthy tan, and that there was a cold perspiration on
  his forehead. Oh, yes, he was afraid, right enough, and Geraldine did not
  forget to let him see that she was aware of it. And from that moment his
  fortune seemed to droop. He was treated with open contempt, he was left
  severely alone&mdash;so severely, in fact, that Miss Benson went off to
  Orange Beach without the formality of saying good-bye to him.</p>

  <p>She might have been annoyed, and she might not, and there was the problem
  that fairly maddened Fox. Did she regard him as a coward? he wondered. But he
  need not have wondered at all, because that was exactly her point of
  view.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, she was angry and disappointed and, perhaps, more
  distressed than she would have liked to admit. For she had never allowed a
  man before to go quite so far as Fox had gone, and that proud little heart of
  hers was sorely wounded. She blamed herself bitterly for allowing her
  affections to stray in the direction of a man who frankly lacked courage. And
  this, in the eyes of a daughter of the West, was an unpardonable sin. She
  would go away down to Orange Beach and forget all about him.</p>

  <p>At the same time Fox made up his mind that he would go away, too, and
  forget all about her, with the inevitable result that he presented himself at
  Stephano's Hotel, at Orange Beach, a fortnight later, where, at dinner, on
  the first night of his arrival, he was coldly and unmistakably cut by his
  late hostess.</p>

  <p>It was tragedy&mdash;stark tragedy&mdash;and Fox's soul was bitter within
  him. He knew perfectly well that he was no coward, he knew perfectly well
  that he was being badly treated, but for the present there was nothing to do
  except wait for an unkind Fate to give him a last chance. And quite
  unexpectedly the Fate aforesaid played straight into his hands.</p>

  <p>Now, behind the five or six miles of smiling paradise that lie between the
  sea and the mountains at Orange Beach is a big swamp given over to various
  flowers of gorgeous beauty, an amazing collection of butterflies like so many
  brilliant jewels flung from the lap of Nature in her most profligate mood,
  and a few wild animals, such as bears and the like, which found their way
  occasionally from the swamps through the wide belt of trees, where honey was
  to be found. No man had ever dared to cross those swamps&mdash; that is, no
  visitor&mdash;only a shy native or two, and at the back of the swamp rose the
  rampart of hills, some peaks of which are above the snow-line. And in this
  belt lurked a few lawless individuals, cattle thieves and the like, who had
  been forced into hiding, where they maintained a precarious existence, and
  where they were hunted down from time to time, when the law-abiding
  inhabitants of the cattle belt summoned up energy enough to make a raid. And
  amongst these desperadoes were two, named respectively Pete and Silas, who
  occasionally looted Orange Beach when food was scarce, and who conceived the
  brilliant idea of kidnapping Miss Geraldine Benson and holding her up to
  ransom. And this they actually did one sunny afternoon, when the girl was
  idling her time away over a book in a secluded corner of the beach. They
  snatched her up and, stifling her cries with a shawl, carried her across the
  swamp up into the hills, and all this in the broad light of day. They and
  they alone of white men knew the only path across that traitorous
  morass&mdash;having learnt the secret from an old peon, whom they had
  thoughtfully disposed of&mdash;so that they were not afraid of pursuit, as,
  before the telegraph and telephone could get in action against them, days
  must of necessity elapse, and their captive's plight grow steadily worse.
  Their idea was simple enough. They were going to demand fifty thousand
  dollars as a ransom, and a free passage to&mdash;well, anywhere, as long as
  they could leave the South American continent behind them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile there was nothing to be done except notify the authorities right
  and left, and organise a movement against the miscreants from the mainland.
  This, of course, was a matter of some considerable time, and Fox fretted and
  fumed, writhing at his own helplessness and burning to do something for the
  woman who had treated him so badly, and for whom he had such tender feelings.
  He actually made one or two attempts to cross the swamp, escaping suffocation
  and a horrible death by the skin of his teeth on two separate occasions
  before he gave it up. He fell into the habit of passing most of his mornings
  on the edge of the swamp, brooding there and racking his brain for some way
  of crossing over to the firm, rugged ground on the far side. If he could only
  accomplish that, he had no fear as to the rest. It would be no great matter
  to track the rascals down then, for they would not be very far off, and if he
  could only confront them with a revolver, he was quite prepared to leave the
  rest to chance.</p>

  <p>And then, on the third day, a ray of hope came his way. As he sat under
  the shade of the trees on the edge of the swamp, he saw a brown, woolly mass
  coming in his direction. It was a bear&mdash;an ordinary brown bear&mdash;
  which had actually crossed that treacherous, smiling greenery in search of
  honey. For an hour or two Fox watched keenly. He saw the bear attack a nest
  of wild bees and surfeit himself with the sweets inside; then he turned his
  snout in the direction of the morass, and seemingly plunged into the thick of
  it. But where a bear could go, a man could follow, so that Fox did not
  hesitate a moment. He tracked the bear very slowly and cautiously into the
  thick of that shuddering horror that smiled so fairly and yet hugged so
  terrible a danger to its verdant breast. Taking a letter or two from his
  pocket, Fox tore them up into minute fragments, dropping one or two here and
  there, so as to make a trail and render his return journey safe. At the end
  of two hours he was on the far side of the swamp, faint and weary, worn out
  and smothered with mud and slime from head to foot. But there was no wind to
  blow his tracks away, so that, with any luck, the return journey was fairly
  easy.</p>

  <p>But it is one thing to go one way over virgin soil, and the other to come
  back in reverse conditions, so that Fox was only half-way across when the
  darkness fell, and he dared not go another yard. He sat himself down on a big
  tuft of grass and waited all through a night which seemed as long as
  eternity. He could hear all sorts of hair-raising sounds going on around him,
  the slimy, oozy crawling of snakes, and once the unmistakable cough of an
  alligator. He sat there reflecting bitterly as to what Geraldine might say if
  she could see him at that moment, and if she would be inclined to call him a
  coward any more. He did not underrate what he was doing, neither did he make
  too much of it. As a matter of fact, it was a wonderful piece of pluck and
  endurance in the face of unseen terrors that might have struck fear into the
  heart of any man.</p>

  <p>The long night came to an end at length, the sun rose, and Fox's spirits
  with it. Very slowly he made his way back, tracing his course by the aid of
  those precious scraps of paper, and finally reached his bedroom before anyone
  in the hotel was about. Then he changed and bathed and had a long sleep,
  after which he slipped a couple of revolvers in his pocket and made his way
  straight down to the swamp again. And there, on the fringe of the wood, was
  his old friend the bear once more. And once more did Fox follow, his pockets
  plentifully filled with torn paper now, so that he blazed a wide white trail
  on both sides of the track until he reached the other side.</p>

  <p>It was all straightforward going now, up a long rocky ravine that led him
  presently into a narrow gorge in the hillside, and round the mountain path
  cut in the side of the cliff, a path so narrow that here and there Fox's
  shoulder brushed the side as he went along. There were some hundred yards or
  more of this, with a sheer drop on the one side of at least three hundred
  feet. It was safe enough and easy enough for a member of the Alpine Club, but
  Fox was worried in his mind as to how Geraldine would negotiate it if he were
  fortunate enough to effect her rescue. But all that for the moment was a
  small issue. He pushed doggedly along until he came at length to a grassy
  little plateau, on the far side of which stood a dilapidated hut, which was
  clearly inhabited, for smoke was comings from the chimney. Then a big man,
  carrying a Winchester rifle in his hand, came out of the hut and strode up
  the valley. As he had a game-bag slung over his shoulder, and a dog trotting
  at his heels. Fox came to the conclusion that the big man was bent on
  supplying the larder. Given any luck, therefore, he would probably not be
  back for some hours yet.</p>

  <p>So it was going to be one man against another. And once that one man was
  out of the way, then the rest would be easy. All the same, Fox crept
  cautiously across the open space, taking advantage of every bit of cover,
  until he was within a yard or two of the door of the hut. He could see that
  this was slightly ajar, he could see there was somebody moving about inside,
  carelessly and freely, as if utterly indifferent to danger. But then clearly
  these men were not expecting anything in the shape of a surprise. They had
  not anticipated the possibility of a frontal attack in any case, and an
  advance upon them from the rear would mean a long business. So the man inside
  the hut was whistling and singing to himself.</p>

  <p>It was only for a moment, however, and then Fox moved swiftly forward and
  stood in the doorway. He had his revolver in his hand now, and the big, gaunt
  figure in the shadow of the hut was covered before the man himself realised
  that he was face to face with an armed and resolute stranger.</p>

  <p>"Put up your hands," Fox said.</p>

  <p>The man immediately dived for such cover as was afforded by a table, and
  from underneath this he fired at Fox twice in rapid succession. But he was
  too flurried and too unsteady for anything like fine work, so that both shots
  passed harmlessly by Fox's head. Then he in his turn pressed the trigger and
  shot his antagonist neatly just beneath the knee of an, exposed leg which had
  been incautiously left within sight.</p>

  <p>Immediately the man dropped his left hand with a cry of rage and pain,
  and, heedless of further danger, rubbed the wounded spot tenderly. Then Fox,
  grim and determined, fired again, and shot his man through the right
  shoulder. The revolver dropped from his fingers, and every ounce of fight
  went out of him. Fox strolled coolly into the hut.</p>

  <p>"Now, then," he said, as he picked up the fallen weapon&mdash;"now, then,
  listen to me. Oh, I know you are in great pain, but that is your own fault.
  But I know you are all alone, because I watched your friend go off with his
  dog and his gun. And now, please, where is the lady?"</p>

  <p>"What lady?" the man asked truculently. His face was white and set with
  pain, and Fox could see that the sweat was running down it. "What lady? Say,
  who're you getting at? There ain't no lady here."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, there is," said a cool, calm voice from somewhere in the
  background. "I'm here, a prisoner in the little lean-to shed at the back of
  the hut."</p>

  <p>The man on the ground smiled in a bitter sort of way and made some attempt
  to hump his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"All right, stranger," he said. "I don't know how you got here, unless you
  came in an aeroplane, but you are top dog, and I am not squealing. Take her
  and get back the way you came. I guess you must know a considerable deal
  about these here parts, for you are the only man on the coast that could find
  his way across them swamps. You see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, never mind about that," Fox said. "I am here, as you have learnt to
  your cost; but I've no time to argue with you, so I am just going to lock you
  in here and leave the key in the door, so that your friend can find you when
  he comes back."</p>

  <p>With which Fox turned abruptly away and went round to the back of the hut,
  where, a few minutes later, he released Geraldine Benson from her
  prison-house. He wanted to get away now as quickly as possible, and to find
  himself round the bend of that dizzy cliff path before the other man
  returned. He might be away for hours, but, on the contrary, he might come
  back at any moment; and, burdened as he was with a frightened and
  nerve-stricken girl, it would never do to invite anything in the shape of a
  conflict until the danger zone was passed.</p>

  <p>But it was no frightened, timorous young woman who emerged from that
  restricted hiding-place, no creature in the last stage of mental prostration.
  Geraldine stood before him neat and cool, and almost spotless in her linen
  dress, her hair as neat and tidy as if she had just come down to breakfast in
  the morning.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's you, is it?" she said.</p>

  <p>There was nothing particularly friendly in her voice, either. She just
  stood there quietly, almost offensively, regarding Fox with a critical look
  which was a poor reward indeed for all that he had done for her.</p>

  <p>"Apparently," he said. "Rather strange, is it not, that I, above all men
  in the world, should be able to do you a service? And I think that you must
  admit that it is a service."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose it is&mdash;indeed, I am sure of it. Still, Mr. Fox, I am
  greatly obliged to you. At any rate, you have relieved me from a great
  unpleasantness."</p>

  <p>"What's the good of talking like the hero and heroine of a melodrama?" Fox
  asked impatiently. "It would be all very well on the stage, but I want you to
  realise that we are in great danger here. That other man might come back at
  any moment&mdash;he might even be watching us now."</p>

  <p>"Yes, there's certainly something in that," the girl said. "But how did
  you get here?</p>

  <p>I have been coming to Orange Beach on and off ever since I was a child,
  and I have always been told that those swamps were impassable, except to one
  or two natives, who have kept the secret for their own sakes."</p>

  <p>"A very pardonable curiosity," Fox said, "and one that I can gratify as we
  go along. This way, please."</p>

  <p>He fell in line by the girl's side, and rapidly they went down the slope
  and up the other side, till they came at length to what appeared to be an
  impasse of rocks.</p>

  <p>"We can't go this way," Geraldine protested.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, this is the way by which you came," Fox replied. "There is
  no other way."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so; I don't know. You see, I was blindfolded, and those men
  carried me part of the way. Oh, Mr. Fox, I couldn't do it&mdash;I couldn't
  indeed! I could never walk along that narrow ledge. The mere thought of a
  cliff always makes me faint and giddy. Call me a coward, if you like!"</p>

  <p>It was strange to see how distressed she was, how white her beautiful face
  had grown, and how filled the clear grey eyes were with terror, It was a
  revelation in its way, and it drew Fox nearer to her than he had ever been
  before.</p>

  <p>"No, I won't call you a coward," he said quietly, "though I think that
  once you applied that epithet to me. You see, it's largely a matter of habit.
  I have seen men who have displayed the highest courage in certain
  circumstances who have been quite helpless in others. But really this is no
  time to go into that sort of thing. If you value your life and safety, you
  will have to crawl along that narrow ledge for a hundred yards or more. After
  that the rest is plain sailing. Come, Miss Geraldine, you're not going to
  funk it now."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I dare not!" the girl said almost piteously. "Oh, I am a
  coward&mdash;I who thought I could face anything! Isn't there any other
  way?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"
     name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1301061h-images/AMatterOfHabit.jpg"
         title="'I-I dare not!' the girl said almost piteously.">
  </div><br>

  <p>"None," Fox said sternly. "And you've got to come, whether you like it or
  not. They brought you this way, but you didn't know the danger, because you
  were blindfolded. And now I'm going to blindfold you again, and you are going
  to be carried on my back like a sack. Oh, it's perfectly safe&mdash;it's only
  a matter of nerve. Why, out in the Alps we should think no more of that than
  we should of climbing up the side of a grass bank. Come, take your courage in
  both hands!"</p>

  <p>All the haughtiness and aloof contempt had left the girl now. She was
  white and shaking from head to foot, and Fox could almost hear the beating of
  her heart as he bound his handkerchief about her eyes. But she was obedient
  enough to do exactly what he told her, as she locked her hands round his
  neck, after which they moved forward along the narrow ledge till the danger
  was passed, and Fox set her on her feet again. He tore the handkerchief from
  her eyes and smiled into her face.</p>

  <p>"There!" he said encouragingly. "Nothing in it, after all!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, please don't laugh at me!" the girl said. "Another minute, and I
  should have fainted&mdash;I who never did such a thing in my life! And yet,
  perhaps, you will believe me when I tell you that I was not really frightened
  when those men got hold of me, and I have managed to keep my head ever since.
  Of course, they told me what they were after, and they promised me I should
  come to no harm, but I don't mind confessing that I was rather proud of my
  courage. Perhaps you will say now that I haven't got any courage."</p>

  <p>"I should say nothing of the sort," Fox replied. "No girl who lacked
  courage could ride the horses you are accustomed to, and no girl could go
  through what you have endured without showing signs of it. I knew a man who
  displayed the most marvellous bravery in connection with a mining accident of
  which he thought nothing, because, you see, he was an engineer and accustomed
  to dangers underground. But it so happened that that man couldn't swim, and
  when I took him on a river in a small boat&mdash;by way of enabling him to
  catch a train&mdash;he sat white and silent, and confessed to me afterwards
  that he had never felt more frightened in his life. And that was one of the
  bravest men I ever met. As I said before, it is all a matter of habit. Of
  course, it's fun to put a man like myself for the first time in my life on
  the back of an unbroken brute of a horse, but it wasn't particularly funny
  for me, and I don't apologise for making an exhibition of myself. I want you
  to understand that there are two points of view, and it's only fair that one
  should try and understand the other fellow's. But come on&mdash;we haven't
  finished yet."</p>

  <p>It was a very quiet and subdued Geraldine whom Fox preceded across the
  stony ground in the direction of the swamp. She was evidently thinking
  matters over, and regarding the philosophy of life from a fresh angle
  altogether. But she began to show signs of nervous hesitation once again as
  Fox plunged into the swamp and bade her to tread carefully in his footsteps.
  There was something fearfully nerve-racking in the green silence of the
  place, with its tufts of rushes and oily, silent pools, and here and there
  the sinuous gleam of a snake.</p>

  <p>"Are you q-quite sure?" the girl faltered.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," Fox said. "I came here across the swamp, of course, and I
  can find my way back again. If you look on both sides of you a little way
  ahead, you will see what looks like the trail of a paper-chase. Well, I
  placed those bits of paper there, so that there should be no mistake. Yes, I
  know it's a horrible place, and I know what a fearful death lurks on both
  sides of us; but we are going to win through, for all that. And you'll never
  guess how I found the way, so I'll tell you. I followed a brown bear that
  came over to the woods in search of honey. I followed in its fresh tracks and
  laid the trail as I went. Yes, it took some doing, and more than once I had
  to hold on to myself to keep from turning back. I knew that, if I once let my
  imagination get hold of me, I should funk it, so I kept steadily on till I
  got on the other side. But getting back was worse. I wanted to locate where
  you were, and I cut it rather fine. Do you see that flat tuft of rushes over
  yonder? Well, I spent the night there, when it got too dark to go any
  further, and I don't want to do it again. Anything more utterly lonely it is
  impossible to imagine. But come along&mdash;I ought not to have told you this
  just yet."</p>

  <p>"And you did all this for me?" Geraldine asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, of course," Fox said simply.</p>

  <p>She did not speak again until they were well across the swamp and in the
  thick fringe of woods at the back of the hotel. There was no one in sight,
  for it was over-early yet, and most of the guests were still at the breakfast
  table. It was just before they emerged into the glorious sunshine that
  Geraldine paused and looked Fox in the face. He could see that she was all
  white and trembling, and that those usually frank and fearless eyes of hers
  were full of tears.</p>

  <p>"I wonder, can you ever forgive me?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to forgive," Fox said. "We have both made a mistake, and
  we are both too proud to admit it. That's why I came down here to see yDu,
  and I suppose that is why you refused to speak to me. But I think I have
  proved&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Proved! Of course you have," Geraldine said impetuously. "And if I had
  cared less&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, then, you do care?"</p>

  <p>Geraldine said nothing, but smiled unsteadily, at which he caught her in
  his arms and kissed her, and together they walked quietly out into the
  sunshine.</p><br>

     name="story4">4.&mdash;BLIND CHANCE</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY G. HENRY EVISON</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, Sep 1917</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THERE was no light in the big room except the deep orange
  glow of the fire on the broad stone hearth, so that the rest was merged in
  the shadows&mdash;shadows velvety black, with suggestions of light here and
  there such as Rembrandt loved to paint. A fine, big room, radiating comfort
  and luxury, and refined silence, as if the world were very far away; which,
  indeed, it was, for the old house nestled on the edge of Whinborough Common,
  over against the golf-links, the only house within two miles of where it
  stood.</p>

  <p>On either side of the fire were deep arm-chairs, merely suggested in that
  velvety gloom; in the big bay window a roll-top desk, which was the only
  modern note in the house. And round about that roll-top desk there played,
  presently, little violet specks of light in thin, dagger-like flashes, hardly
  visible in themselves, but quite sufficient for their purpose. There came,
  too, suddenly, a touch of the keen October air, as if a window had been
  suddenly opened. And after that a faint creaking sound as if, perchance, the
  top of the desk had been pushed back very quietly and cautiously, followed by
  a fat and greasy chink, as if two coins had come in contact one with the
  other. Then a minute disc of violet light concentrated itself upon a little
  heap of sovereigns and the crisp outline of a bank-note or two. All this with
  no more sound than a mouse would have made behind the old oak panelling there
  at the back of the velvet-black shadows; but it was sufficient for one man
  there.</p>

  <p>He leant forward out of the depths of his big arm-chair where he had been
  seated, listening and sniffing up the damp pungency of the dew-drenched
  night, seated there as if he had been part and parcel of the shadows. There
  was just a tiny click, and the room was flooded with light.</p>

  <p>"Come along," the man in the arm-chair said. "Sit there in the chair
  opposite me." He spoke quietly enough, in a slow, clear-cut voice that had in
  it a vibration of command and perhaps a certain suggestion of cruelty. The
  other man, standing by the desk with the electric torch in his hand, wheeled
  suddenly round and stood there with parted lips and terror in those watery
  brown eyes of his.</p>

  <p>"Roger Broadley!" he gasped.</p>

         title="'Roger Broadley!' he gasped.">
  </div>

  <p>The words were faint enough, but they carried to the ears of the man
  sitting in the big arm-chair. He made no sign, the suggestion of a smile was
  still upon his lips, and those merciless flint-blue eyes of his were turned
  steadily upon the man with the torch in his hand. The smile was so fixed and
  the blue eyes so steadfast that the intruder was puzzled to know whether his
  startled expression had been heard or not. His first impulse was flight by
  the open window at the back of the desk, or, alternately, through the open
  door. But the craven fear that had paralyzed the man called Canton all his
  life held him now, and he cursed himself silently for his want of purpose. He
  was afraid to turn and fly, afraid of the bullet that might follow him, or
  the strong, nervous hand that might pluck him back. Very slowly and
  reluctantly he crossed the room and dropped unsteadily into the chair on the
  other side of the fireplace. He was still puzzled and dazed, and almost madly
  anxious to know if the other had recognized him. And there were urgent
  reasons why he should not be recognized</p>

  <p>But he could see no gleam of remembrance in the concentrated lightning of
  those flint-blue eyes. And with that Canton began to pull himself together
  again. With any luck he might be able to bluff himself out of it yet.</p>

  <p>"Fairly got me, haven't you?" he hazarded, with a certain uneasy
  assumption of ease. "Know me, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>He spoke with just the suggestion of a lisp, a slight defect due toa
  missing front tooth. The big man in the opposite arm-chair
  smiled&mdash;smiled in a horribly capable, assured manner that brought the
  sweat out on Canton's face again. For the other man was so big and strong, so
  capable and certain of his ground. And those blue eyes burnt and seared like
  so many live wires in the heart of the craven opposite.</p>

  <p>"We won't discuss that for the moment," Broadley said. "And we need not
  waste time in guessing the reason that brought you here. That torch of yours
  and the open desk yonder with the gold and notes lying there would be proof,
  I think, satisfactory to any magistrate of ordinary intelligence. Now, this
  is the first time I have ever had the pleasure of meeting a gentleman of your
  profession. Have you been brought up to it, or was it, so to speak, forced
  upon you?"</p>

  <p>Canton almost smiled. Obviously this man, whom he had every cause to fear,
  had not recognized him. Indeed, why should he? Canton argued, for they had
  never met face to face, though Canton knew Broadley well enough by
  reputation. The mean little face, with its narrow, shifty eyes and unsteady
  lips, grew more resolute, and hope began to bud again.</p>

  <p>"Well?" Broadley said. "Well? Of course, you needn't talk unless you like.
  I suppose you know I am alone in the house. My man is away with the car, at
  Oxbridge Station, waiting for a friend of mine. So, you see, we are quite
  alone, and merely man to man. There is nothing to detain you. You can go, if
  you like. Why don't you?"</p>

  <p>Canton snarled bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I know all about that," he said. "You are a bigger man than I
  am, and you wouldn't talk like that if you weren't armed. Directly I turn my
  hack upon you, I shall get one through the shoulder. You can't fool me!"</p>

  <p>"I am not trying," Broadley said, quietly. "I am stating a self-evident
  fact, if you only knew it. You have me at a great disadvantage."</p>

  <p>Canton snarled again; he would have liked to have risen up and struck this
  sneering antagonist of his between those merciless blue eyes. He would have
  liked to disfigure that clean-shaven, humorous face, with its faint
  suggestion of cruelty about the corners of the lips. But he was afraid, and
  he cursed himself for his fear. He knew himself to be a sneak and a coward,
  as he had been all his life. He sat there sullenly till Broadley spoke
  again.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," the latter said. "I have given you every opportunity. I
  have told you you could go if you like, and that you had me at a great
  disadvantage. But you are the class of criminal who never knows when he hears
  the truth; in fact, doesn't understand when he does hear it. You think you
  are my prisoner. Well, we'll let it go at that. I am quite alone in the
  house, and feel in the mood for company. Now tell me something about your
  past life. From your accent, I should judge that at one time you were what is
  called a gentleman?"</p>

  <p>The little spurt of hope burnt more clearly in Canton's breast. He was
  still in deadly fear of the man opposite, afraid of his strength and his
  coolness; but it might be possible that a plausible tale, well told, would
  pave the path to freedom. And George Canton was quite good at that sort cf
  thing. It was just the sneaking line of policy that his soul loved.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right there," he said, "I was a gentleman at one time.
  Public school and university; though, if you don't mind, I won't say
  which."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't mind in the least," Broadley smiled. "It would probably be a
  lie, in any case. Go on."</p>

  <p>"You may not believe it," Canton said, "but I was brought up for the
  Church. And at one time I was honestly under the impression that I should
  make a success of it. But somehow it didn't seem to work, and when I found
  myself in London at the age of twenty-three with a fair income and quite good
  prospects, I drifted gradually into evil ways, until nearly everything was
  gone and I had lost most of my friends."</p>

  <p>"And then you married?" Broadley suggested.</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;then you know?" Canton gasped.</p>

  <p>"My good man, surely that was a reasonable guess. Men of your type always
  marry. For some occult reason, known only to Providence, the average waster
  seems always in a position to command the love and affection of some good
  woman. I have seen it over and over again. And she clings to him till the
  end, where she would tire of a man worthy of the name. Of course you married.
  And of course, you broke the heart of the woman who gave herself to
  you&mdash;though you going to deny it."</p>

  <p>"I didn't," Canton retorted. "I tell you I made a mistake; perhaps we both
  did, for the matter of that. I had lost nearly all my money, as I told you,
  and all my friends, and I was beginning to get tired of the life I was
  leading. It seemed to me that if I could meet the right woman there was a
  chance for me yet, because I was still young and I had not done badly, at
  school and Cambridge. And I did meet her; at least, I thought so. To begin
  with, she knew a good deal about my past, and was quite prepared to overlook
  it. And, mind you, I had still a few hundreds left. My idea was to go into
  business and settle down and become a respectable member of society. And I
  believe I should have done so if my wife had helped me."</p>

  <p>"And she didn't?" Broadley asked, mockingly.</p>

  <p>"Not after the first few months," Canton went on. "Perhaps it wasn't
  altogether her own fault. I was too easy with her, too fond of her, and
  allowed her to have her own way too much. She hadn't the least notion of the
  value of money, and everything she wanted she just got. We were living in a
  flat in Bloomsbury, where my family had had a lot of property at one time, so
  that my credit was good, and my wife could get all she needed. It was the old
  story: a foolish man over head and ears in love with a silly woman, vain and
  frivolous, who had only one object in life, and that was to enjoy herself.
  You can imagine how I suffered with the little money I had going out every
  day and nothing coming in, because my business efforts were a failure. You
  see, I wasn't made for business, I wasn't trained for it; and though I tried
  hard enough, God knows, I lost one situation after another."</p>

  <p>Canton paused and sighed eloquently, the my sigh of a man who has told his
  tale before and found it good. He reflected that perhaps he might touch the
  heart of the man opposite to a pitch of something more than freedom. And,
  above all, he had the feeling that Broadley had not recognized him.</p>

  <p>"Go on," Broadley said. "I am always interested in the human document,
  especially when it has frayed edges."</p>

  <p>"Well, the time came at last," Canton proceeded, "when things reached a
  crisis. I had no money left, and when my pretty doll of a wife discovered
  that, she threatened to leave me. Just at that time I was in the office of a
  big firm of jewellers. It was not that I was getting much, but my employer
  trusted me. More than once he had sent me to a great house in the West-end
  with gems to deliver on approval. That night I came home with a pearl
  necklace in my pocket. It should have been delivered that evening at the
  house of one of our great millionaires, but her ladyship was out of town, or
  gone to some big function, so I took the case home with me. Would to Heaven I
  had done nothing of the kind! Would that I had said nothing to my wife about
  it, for she stole that necklace when I was asleep, and tried to sell it. Of
  course, she was found out; of course, she was discovered and prosecuted for
  the theft. I was arrested too, and the people who prosecuted me tried to make
  out that she was a tool in the matter, and that I had merely used my wife as
  a shield to hide my own crime."</p>

  <p>"And the jury believed it?" Broadley asked, dryly.</p>

  <p>"They did, sir; they did," Canton whined.</p>

  <p>"They said that my wife was absolutely innocent, and that when I sent her
  with those pearls in her pocket to sell them to a notorious receiver of
  stolen goods for five hundred pounds I did so because I was too much of a
  coward to take them myself. I remember that the judge was particularly hard
  on me."</p>

  <p>"I can imagine it," Broadley smiled. "I can imagine him saying that you
  were a particularly poisonous type of humanity, and a scoundrel of the worst
  kind who never hesitates to shield himself behind an innocent and injured
  woman."</p>

  <p>"But you don't believe it, sir?" Canton asked, with some anxiety. "You
  have heard of hard-working men who have been ruined by their wives?"</p>

  <p>"Many a time," Broadley said. "And so, you are one of that class, are you?
  Evidently a sad case. But I interrupt you. What was the upshot of the
  tragedy?"</p>

  <p>"I got five years," Canton said. "And they acquitted my wife, the judge
  saying that he was convinced that she was absolutely innocent. You see, being
  a pretty woman with friends, she could call all sorts of evidence in her
  favour, and she did. Why, when the jury acquitted her, there was actually
  applause in court. Not that I minded; I still loved her far too well to want
  to see her suffer."</p>

  <p>Just for a moment the two steel-blue eyes turned fully on Canton's face
  blazed, and the strong, capable hands on the elbows of the arm&mdash;chair
  clenched till the knuckles stood out like ivory. Then the humorous mouth
  smiled again.</p>

  <p>"Your sentiments do you credit," Broadley said. "I quite understand, the
  strong man suffering in silence for the sake of a shallow and frivolous
  woman. My good sir, the thing has been done in scores of novels and plays,
  and will go on appealing to the gallery as long as there is a cinema palace
  left. So you went to jail, and the woman escaped scot-free. And what happened
  afterwards ? Did you seek her out, did you find her in rags and poverty, and
  take her back to your broad, manly bosom and wipe her tears away?"</p>

  <p>Canton winced, hut wisely ignored the sarcasm. He was fighting for his
  liberty now, and therefore declined to be ruffled hy such a little thing as
  that.</p>

  <p>"I did find her, sir." he said. "And she did come back to me for a short
  time. But I had to leave her; I had to leave her because she was past all
  endurance. I gave her every penny that I had, and we parted for ever."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," Broadley said, softly, "I wonder if, on the face of God's
  earth, there is a slimier seoundrel than yourself? You did nothing of the
  kind, Canton."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;then you recognize me!" the other gasped.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I recognized you right enough. I knew who you were directly I turned
  the light on and you uttered my name under your breath. We have never met
  face to face, but you have seen me and you knew who I was at once. If you had
  known that this bungalow belonged to me, I hardly think that you would be
  sitting here to-night. I heard you speak only once when I was in the next
  room to you on an occasion that you might remember, and that little lisp of
  yours betrayed you&mdash;and the way in which you whispered my name. And,
  Geroge Canton, you can take it from me that I never forget. When Nature
  deprives a man of one sense, she generally makes up for it by strengthening
  another. You rascal, how dare you lie to me!"</p>

  <p>Canton put up hands as if to ward off a blow. He knew that all his efforts
  were in vain, he know that he could expect no mercy at the hands of this man.
  He looked around wildly for some avenue of escape, anywhere to get away from
  those blazing eyes and that hard face that now was as cruel as the grave. But
  he could see no sign of an opening anywhere.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>"Now, let <i>me</i> tell you the story, Broadley said, coldly and
  incisively in words that seemed to drop like little bits of ice along
  Canton's spine. "Let us collaborate. You see, I am rather practised at that
  game. I think I can add a touch or two of realism to that glib narrative of
  yours."</p>

  <p>"Just as you like, sir," Canton said fawningly.</p>

  <p>"Then, in that case, let us begin at the beginning. It is twelve years
  ago&mdash;twelve years ago to-night, strangely enough&mdash;that I became
  engaged to be married. You know what Agnes Westley was like, so I will not
  waste time in painting her portrait for you. She was as good as she was
  beautiful, in every way a perfect woman, and she loved me. My prospects were
  then perfect, there was no cloud on the horizon anywhere. Really you had
  better go before I murder you."</p>

  <p>Canton looked hopelessly into the heart of the fire and then round the big
  room, with its bookshelves and pictures and the glint of china in the
  cabinets, and his jaw worked convulsively. He burst out suddenly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You are torturing me, you devil!" he said. "You know I cannot get away,
  you know I am in your power!"</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," Broadley said, more evenly. "You have had your chance,
  and when you realise what you have lost and <i>how</i> you lost it&mdash;but
  never mind that. Let me go on. Where was I? Yes, I was talking of Agnes
  Westley. I didn't know then that she knew you. I didn't know that you were
  planning and contriving to come between us until it was too late and I had
  lost her, owing to those lies of yours and those forgeries that she believed.
  And for two years I did not know where she was, until wrote to me for money.
  She would not have done so but that you forced her, and it was only then that
  I learnt the story. When I called to see her in London I found her in
  miserable lodgings, for your money was all gone, and you were in desperate
  straits to find food for your wife and yourself. You were in bed at the time,
  you remember, and l heard you speak. I heard those rasping tones of yours
  with that unmistakable lisp, which I have never forgotten, and which,
  somehow, I knew I should hear again. And even then, low as you had fallen,
  and badly as you had behaved, Agnes was doing her best to he a good wife to
  you. I helped her, as you know, hut she would only take sufficient for her
  bare needs, and I left her, promising to see her again. The next day she was
  arrested in an attempt to get rid of those pearls which you had stolen. You
  told me a lie just now when you said you were a trusted servant. You stole
  those jewels, and, like the coward and cur that you are, you did not dare to
  take them to your employer who had commissioned you to steal them. You knew
  that the police were watching you; you deceived your wife, and she fell into
  the hands of the police. And your defence was that you were a poor and
  struggling man who had been ruined hy an extravagant wife, who took advantage
  of your love for her to spend all you had. You contemptible scoundrel, you
  vile and filthy dog! Never was there a man who had a more loyal helpmate,
  though she had discovered the trick you had played upon her long before. But
  you were not ashamed to stand up in the dock by her side and tell the judge
  much what you were telling me just now hefore you realized that I had
  recognised you, and when you were hoping to play upon my clemency. But the
  evidence of the police was too strong for you, and the unhappy woman who
  stood in the dock with you was acquitted. The police behaved very fairly so
  far as she was concerned, and she left the court without a stain on her
  character. Everybody believed that she was innocent and that she did not know
  what she was doing when she attempted to get rid of those pearls. And so you
  got your deserts, and she was free. And, knowing this, you come here to rob
  me and still further vilify the woman who behaved so loyally to you. In the
  face of all this you expect me to let you go. But not quite like that, Mr.
  Canton. I am working out a little revenge of my own, and when you realize how
  I am bringing it about, then I think I shall be satisfied. Now, have you
  anything more to say?"</p>

  <p>Once more Canton looked round the room, once more he weighed up the
  chances of a struggle with the man who sat opposite him in the big arm-chair.
  But it was all useless, all so futile that he resigned himself in a sullen
  despair. What was the use of speaking, what was to be gained by an appeal to
  that grim-faced man with the merciless blue eyes who sat in the big chair
  opposite?</p>

  <p>"You say nothing," Broadley went on. "And so I had better finish my story.
  From time to time I helped Agnes, until you were free, and then I persuaded
  her to accept a certain sum of money at my hands and go abroad. You came back
  just about that time and robbed her of every penny she had. You robbed her
  and left her to starve. And she would have starved but for me; though, mind
  you, I did not find out this till long afterwards, when she was dying of
  fever&mdash;dying alone and friendless in a little cottage in the country. It
  is nothing to you that I contracted that fever, and that, in one way, I have
  never been the same man since."</p>

  <p>Canton listened miserably enough, still with a desperate hope that
  something might happen in his favour, until presently he could hear the sound
  of wheels in the distance, and a car pulled up in front of the bungalow. Then
  there were voices in the hall, and a moment or two later the door of the
  library opened and a man in the uniform of a chauffeur came in.</p>

  <p>"Ah, here you are, Rufford," Broadley cried. "Did I hear Mr. Stern's
  voice?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," the man called Rufford said. "He has gone up to his bedroom to
  wash his hands. I told him as I was looking after you, and that supper would
  be ready in the dining-room directly he came down. But I beg your pardon,
  sir."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't go away," Broadley went on.</p>

  <p>"You are not intruding, Rufford. In fact, if you are quite ready, I want
  you to look after this visitor of mine. He is quite an involuntary guest, a
  kind of Autolycus&mdash; that is, Rufford, what you call a snapper-up of
  unconsidered trifles. In other words, a burglar, who found his way in through
  the window under the mistaken impression that the house was empty. We have
  been having quite an interesting chat, Rufford, and I find that the gentleman
  is an old acquaintance of mine."</p>

  <p>"That's very clever of you, sir," Rufford said. "You have had a narrow
  escape, I think."</p>

  <p>Canton listened dully. It struck him that Rufford's words concealed a
  certain cruel irony.</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps I have, Rufford," Broadley said. "But, then, appearances
  are deceptive, and our friend here, fortunately, does not know as much as you
  and I. You had better take this fellow and tie him up and lock him in the
  larder. I believe there are iron bars to the window. Then you can telephone
  for the police, and keep an eye on the fellow till they come. And if he slips
  through your fingers, Rufiord, I shall be exceedingly annoyed. I am not a
  vindictive man, as you know, but I have peculiar reasons so far as this scamp
  is concerned."</p>

  <p>"I think you can rely upon me, sir," Rufford said.</p>

  <p>"I think I can. Is that Mr. Stern calling? All right, Walter, I am coming.
  Go into the dining-room and wait for me, and we'll have some supper. I think
  that's all, Rufford."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," Rufford replied.</p>

  <p>Broadley rose quietly from his chair and crossed the room slowly and
  deliberately, touching the back of a chair here and there until he felt his
  way out into the hall. It was all done so quietly and withal so cautiously
  that Canton for the moment hardly understood. Then understanding came to him
  as he turned with a sudden savage energy to the imperturbable Rufford.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what's the matter with him?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you know?" Rufford replied. "He has been like that ever since an
  attack of scarlet fever years ago. My master is <i>stone-blind</i>."</p><br>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5">5.&mdash;THE REAL DRAMATIC TOUCH</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY FRANK GILLETT</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XLVI, Sep 1917, pp
  386-392</h3><br>

  <p class="first">IT was a great nuisance, of course, especially for a young
  man in the first flush of a glorious manhood, properly gilt with a fine
  overlay of necessary dollars, but there was no help for it. It did not
  necessarily follow that Perry Brogden was any the less of a business man
  because his life was entirely devoted to pleasure and the seductive joys of
  New York. Because he came from a race of business men&mdash;the instinct was
  in his blood&mdash;and, rich as he was, he did not view with equanimity the
  idea of sacrificing a million or two simply because he was too lazy to
  stretch out his hand and get it. Still, it was the season in New York, the
  hospitalities of Fifth Avenue were in full blast, and the theatres were more
  than usually alluring. All this naturally appealed to the fine, athletic
  young man, who was wont to come up smiling at breakfast-time on the morning
  after the night before, and declare with perfect truth that he had never felt
  more fit in his life. Moreover, he belonged to all the exclusive clubs, and
  there wasn't a single dowager in Fifth Avenue who would not have been
  delighted to call Perry Brogden her son-in-law.</p>

  <p>And now he had come into still more money, left him by a typical backwoods
  uncle, the genuine "hayseed" who had made his money somewhere north of
  Patagonia, where he had died after forty years in a wilderness without one
  solitary glance of Western civilisation. This uncle had been the owner of the
  Island of&mdash;well, let us call it Terra Incognita, a long slice of
  country, picturesque and romantic, between Brazil and Patagonia, where he had
  devoted his energies to something like a million head of stock. As a matter
  of fact, Brogden had never seen him; but this neat little accumulation of
  dollars had come his way now, and it was up to him to look after it. His idea
  was to get out to Terra Incognita with a view to making an inventory of
  things there, and sell the property as quickly as possible to the best
  advantage. He knew something about ranches, for he had once spent the best
  part of a year in the role of an amateur cowboy on the plains of Texas,
  before his father had died and the lure of New York had proved too strong for
  him.</p>

  <p>He didn't in the least want to go&mdash;he had no desire to turn his back
  upon the theatres, where he was favourably known, and where a score or more
  of actresses called him by his Christian name&mdash;but he was wise enough to
  see the necessity of grace before meat, so to speak, so he hired himself a
  steam yacht and set off for the long journey beyond the reach of
  civilisation, taking with him one Larry Hack, a genuine Texas cowboy whom he
  had made friends with, and who would not only be a friend and companion, but
  a sound judge of the fat beeves and wool-bearing sheep that formed the
  population of Terra Incognita. There was an old overseer there, it was
  true&mdash;a dour, sour Scotsman with a taste for solitude&mdash;a handful of
  peons, and certain natives who did much as they liked on the island, so long
  as they did not interfere with the course of business.</p>

  <p>The yacht came, in the course of time, to the little natural harbour, and
  the overseer was looked up by Perry Brogden and his <i>fidus Achates</i> in a
  dilapidated old hacienda where Havelock lived and divided his time
  impartially between his work, his whisky, and certain theological books of
  the school made popular by Ernest Renan and his satellites. He was a crabbed
  man, hard as nails, exceedingly bad-tempered, but, withal, industrious and
  honest, as your Scotsman is the world over.</p>

  <p>"You'll no stay here long, I'm thinking, Mr. Perry," he said, as they
  smoked a pipe together. "It's a mighty fine climate the noo, and a bonny
  picture, but it's dull&mdash;aye, it's dull&mdash;and if you could stand
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It certainly was a beautiful picture, with those great frowning cliffs on
  the verge of the sea, and the deep fertile valleys fringed with forest trees
  behind, a marvellous natural picture and a perfect setting for any romance
  that might happen along, and Brogden was greatly impressed by it.</p>

  <p>"It's grand," he said&mdash;"grand! Absolutely made for adventures. Do you
  ever have any, Mr. Havelock?"</p>

  <p>"Never one in forty years," Havelock said. "Hoots, mon, there's nothing
  here to stir the sluggish blood. We used to have wee bit trouble with the
  natives, who are part Patagonian Indians, ye ken; but we let 'em alone, and
  they let us alone. And if we miss a beast or a sheep sometimes&mdash;why, it
  doesn't much matter, and no questions are asked. But maybe it is not your
  intention to stay here."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Brogden said emphatically. "I'll just remain long enough
  to make an inventory, with a view to selling the whole thing, lock, stock,
  and barrel. How long do you think that'll take me, Havelock?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, well," Havelock said guardedly, "perhaps a week, perhaps a month. But
  we'd better say a month. Because, ye ken, the spirit moves me sometimes, an'
  it takes a week of whisky to lay it again. Forby, I may keep sober for a
  fortnight, and then ye'll be all right."</p>

  <p>"Oh, take your time," Brogden said. "Meanwhile Larry Hack and myself will
  do a bit of prospecting. You've got some nice-looking horses here, I see.
  Just pack us enough grub and blankets to keep us going for three or four
  days, and we'll have a run round the island. I don't want to interfere with
  your work, and you needn't hurry over it, either."</p>

  <p>For the next few days Brogden and his companion ranged far and near over
  the glorious country, at one time down in the well-watered valleys, where the
  grass was nearly knee-deep, and the contented herds were fattening, at
  another killing game in the forest that fringed the slopes, and anon along
  the higher ranges, that were capped with snow. It was a glorious life in one
  of the most glorious climates in the world, and the air, fine as champagne,
  sang in the veins of the adventurers.</p>

  <p>"Aye, it's real grand, this," Larry Hack said. "Knocks spots off Texas.
  All we want now is a convenient bar and an occasional mix-up, just to make
  things happy and comfortable. The better I feel, the more I spoil for a
  fight. Not that we're likely to get it here, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not, Larry," Brogden said regretfully. "The few Indian chaps
  we've met are picturesque-looking enough, and the right type, according to
  the pictures, but they are most disgustingly peaceful."</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess we've got to make the best of it," Hack said. "Anyway, it's
  good to be out in the open air again, with a fine horse between one's knees,
  and, perhaps, with the blessing of Providence, we shall hit something up
  yet."</p>

  <p>A day or two drifted by, until at length they emerged out of the valley
  past a wide, sweeping plain along the edge of the cliffs, which were broken
  here and there by sudden declivities and rocky ramparts that fringed the
  shore. A mile or so ahead, on a bold promontory, stood an old farmhouse, or
  hacienda, which appeared to be deserted and more or less falling into decay,
  a house built there, no doubt, in the old days by some sanguine settler,
  before the advent of old man Brogden, with his new methods and keen business
  habits. The two men lay there on the grass, smoking their pipes after a
  hearty tea in the early afternoon, and idly debated as to whether it would be
  better to push on and make the picturesque ruins their headquarters for the
  night, or stay and camp where they were. They were still talking it over
  idly, when Brogden sat up suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Here, what's going on over there?" he asked. "I can see figures moving
  about like bees outside a hive, and&mdash;well, if that place isn't on fire,
  I'm much mistaken."</p>

  <p>Surely enough a thin wisp of smoke rose from the hacienda and drifted idly
  on the amber air. It increased in volume presently, until a dense black pall
  hung overhead, and yellow tongues of flame lifted themselves above the broken
  timbers of the house. Round about the blaze a score or more of figures danced
  excitedly, buzzing around like wasps that had been smoked out of their nest.
  Brogden grabbed eagerly for his glasses.</p>

  <p>"They're Indians," he said, after a long inspection. "Here, Larry, look
  for yourself. They're Indians on the war-path, and they've set the place on
  fire. Here is your adventure, my boy&mdash;something wrong over there."</p>

  <p>"Yes, they're Dagoes, right enough," Hack drawled, "And, by all that's
  holy, they've got guns, too! There's something going on inside that old
  building that's got their dander up considerable. Now, shall we cut in and
  take a hand, or shall we just sit quietly here and see how the land lies? It
  would be a thousand pities to miss the fun."</p>

  <p>By way of reply, Brogden snatched the glasses from his friend's hand and
  glued them to his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It's no ordinary scrap," he said. "There's something going on here that I
  don't like the look of at all. Look, there are women there! White women, too!
  American girls dressed in white, and ladies, I should say!"</p>

  <p>Amazing as it seemed, it was even as Brogden said. With the aid of the
  powerful glasses he could see everything that was going on. He saw the
  natives rushing the building they had set on fire, he saw one of the
  shuttered windows open, and two girls standing on the verandah, clinging to
  one another and evidently terrified to the verge of distraction. Then he saw
  half a dozen men rush frantically towards the blazing mass and snatch up the
  girls in their arms.</p>

  <p>A moment or two later a man appeared, a man dressed as a tourist, in a
  neat grey flannel suit, a man who had a cigarette in his mouth and in either
  hand a revolver, which he emptied indiscriminately into the crowd opposite.
  In Larry's language, he was no slouch of a shot, for half a dozen of the foe
  suddenly collapsed and lay there on the grass, taking no further interest in
  the proceedings. Almost immediately there was another rush, and the man in
  the grey suit was overpowered in his turn and rendered harmless. Then the
  whole party slowly began to move towards the cliffs where the rocks shelved
  down to the shore.</p>

  <p>"Well, that chap ain't no slouch as a revolver shot," Larry said, speaking
  in the tones of an expert. "But say, boss, are we goin' to stop frozen here,
  or are we goin' to hustle round and strike a blow for civilisation?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," Brogden said, "it's no use butting headlong into a fray like
  this. There are only two of us, and we are none too well off for ammunition.
  If we do anything rash, we shall share the same fate as the rest. No, we must
  stalk them, and try to take them unawares."</p>

  <p>The horses were picketed in a little grove, the provisions hidden, and
  then, very slowly and cautiously, Brogden and his companion crept through the
  long grass in the direction of the spot where the Indians had gathered
  together in a circle, in the centre of which were their captives, bound and
  helpless. The whole thing was amazing&mdash;a sort of spectacular dream, and
  the last thing in the world to be expected in that peaceful spot.</p>

  <p>"Seems almost like a nightmare," Brogden murmured. "Now, who, in the name
  of Mike, can those people be, and what are they doing here? The man in the
  grey suit might have just stepped out of his club, and those two women are
  most beautifully turned out&mdash;white muslin dresses, suggestive of Paris,
  and all the rest of it. I have never seen anything like it outside the
  theatre before."</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll soon know," Larry said cheerfully. "Wbat we've got to do is
  to get as close as we can and lie low till it gets dark. I don't suppose
  they'll trouble to post any sentries. Guess they look upon themselves as
  absolutely safe, which is where we come in later on, when they lie down with
  clear consciences for a good night's rest. And we, with a couple of revolvers
  apiece, ought to be able to round up the bag and balance the accounts of
  those chaps nicely."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's a very good programme," Brogden said impatiently, "especially
  if they play the game according to the rules. What are they up to now?"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, one of the girls in white was jerked to her feet and led
  away, shrinking and protesting, in the direction of the low cliffs, which
  hung sheer for twenty feet or so over the edge of the sea. Through the
  glasses it was plain to see the fear on her face and the look of dumb anguish
  in her eyes. But her struggles and protestations were&mdash; apparently all
  in vain, for she was urged on, not without violence, towards the edge of the
  sloping cliff where it came within some twenty feet or so of the sea beneath.
  And all this was being watched with the keenest interest by the two men,
  anxious and willing enough to take a hand, but quite conscious of the fact
  that any interference on their part might lead to unpleasant consequences to
  themselves without benefiting the hapless victim in the least. They could
  only sit there and sweat, and swear, and grind their teeth, hoping against
  hope that something might happen to give them a real chance.</p>

  <p>And then gradually they began to understand what was the real intention of
  those dancing, yelling fiends on the edge of the cliff. They could see that
  the leader of them&mdash;a big man who appeared to belong to another
  nationality altogether&mdash;had passed a rope or a lariat under the woman's
  arms, and that she was being lowered over the edge of the cliff until she was
  suspended six or seven feet above the sea. Then the end of the rope was made
  fast on the top of the cliff, and the woman, helpless and impotent, was left
  to her fate.</p>

  <p>Hack drew a long, deep breath.</p>

  <p>"Do you begin to spot what the game is, boss?" he whispered. "Those devils
  are going to leave that woman there to drown. As the tide rises, so will her
  fate be sealed. And all we can do is to sit here looking on like a pair of
  dudes in the stalls of a New York theatre! I have seen some pretty
  cold-blooded things in my time, but never a stunt like this. Guess that
  woman's got some secret they want her to tell, and they'll leave her there to
  drown or call out before it is too late. Here, say, I can't stand this!"</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" Brogden asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess I'm going to crawl back as far as the camp and get hold of
  a Winchester. You just freeze yourself here till I come back. I ain't no
  slouch as a shot, as you know, and from here I calculate I can lob a bullet
  into that big bully in the sombrero, and fix a receipt stamp to his little
  account. And there ain't no hurry, either. It brings the blood into your
  face, but I calculate that poor girl's got to wait a spell. And maybe we can
  save her yet."</p>

  <p>Larry Hack was back in a few moments with a rifle in his hand. He gazed
  long and earnestly in the direction of the speck of white suspended there
  between heaven and earth over the side of the cliff. Then his lips began to
  twitch and his eyes to sparkle.</p>

  <p>"Say, boss," he said, "you ain't no slouch as a swimmer."</p>

  <p>Brogden admitted the compliment, which in his case was no compliment at
  all, because he really was an expert in the water.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's all right," he said, "but I don't quite see how it helps
  matters."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's like this, general," Hack went on. "You drop into the water
  and swim out as far as the girl. You can't reach her from the sea, I know,
  but that's where I come in. Now, from where those chaps are they can't see
  what's going on, and, as far as I can guess, they seem to be getting pretty
  busy with the Bourbon. And they won't move till the girl cries out, which I
  don't suppose'll be till the water reaches her knees, anyhow. Long before
  that time you ought to be right handy there on the spot, and when the
  persecuted heroine drops into your arms, you can swim with her round the
  point. There's a bit of a sandy beach on the far side which you can just see,
  and you can land her there. You can do that, can't you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that ought to be easy enough," Brogden said. "I can get her ashore
  without a doubt. But how am I going to lay hands on her?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you all that," Hack said. "I can creep within a couple of
  hundred yards or so along yonder ledge of rocks, and I'm going to shoot her
  free."</p>

  <p>"Shoot her free?"</p>

  <p>"Guess that's the programme, commander. I can hit that rope at two hundred
  yard? and cut it in a couple of shots, or I've forgotten how to shoot. Why,
  I've split a willow wand at three hundred yards before now, and won money
  over it. Oh, that's all right. Then you get along with the booty, and I'll
  skirt the camp and join you on the other side with the Winchester and our
  revolvers. We'll put up some sort of a fight, and maybe, with any luck, get
  away safely."</p>

  <p>It was a desperate chance, but then the situation was desperate, and
  Brogden was not disposed to hesitate. He had no doubts whatever about his
  prowess as a swimmer, and he felt convinced that, if Larry's aim was sure, he
  conld manage to convey the unfortunate girl to safety without very much
  trouble. If she had ordinary pluck, she might listen to what he had to say,
  when he got near enough to her to explain, and once he had her safely in his
  arms he did not doubt the issue. Moreover, from where they were seated, the
  Indians could not see what was going on, and, so long as they remained where
  they were, the plan might go forward without hindrance. And once the girl was
  landed on the beach, and Hack joined his companion, they might have a real
  fair chance of getting away altogether.</p>

  <p>The moment of danger would come, of course, directly Hack fired his first
  shot. That would certainly alarm the ruffians and bring them to their feet at
  once. But then, if Hack were cautious, he would be able to hide himself, and
  the search for him might, in fortunate circumstances, give Brogden the
  precious moments that he required.</p>

  <p>All this having been settled, Brogden divested himself of most of his
  clothing and plunged boldly into the sea. A quarter of an hour's steady
  swimming brought him to the point of the cliffs over which the fair victim in
  white was suspended. He could see that her hands and feet were bound, and
  that she was supported by leather thongs under her arms. Apparently her
  captors were not entirely devoid of human feeling, for Brogden could see that
  the rope was padded. He could also see that the girl was exceedingly fair to
  look at, with regular features, which features, however, to his surprise,
  bore the evident marks of paint and powder. Evidently a heroine, no doubt,
  who was not familiar with the rough life of the South Pacific, and probably,
  with her unfortunate sister and the man in the flannel suit, had landed on
  that lone coast from some ship or yacht, which in all probability was not far
  off.</p>

  <p>Those bonds were all in Brogden's favour. They would prevent the helpless
  heroine from dragging on him, so that, when the time came, she would be
  compelled to do exactly as he told her. He trod water easily and began to
  speak.</p>

  <p>Hardly were the first words out of his mouth before there came the sound
  of a shot, followed by a second one, and then, as if by a conjuring trick,
  the rope broke, and the girl in white fell almost into Brogden's arms. He
  heard the wild scream that came from her lips as she disappeared under the
  surface, then, as she came up again, he caught her by the shoulders and
  turned her gently on her side.</p>

         title="The rope broke, and the girl in white fell...">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Don't be frightened," he said. "You are perfectly safe. You can manage to
  get the tips of your fingers on my shoulders, can't you? But, whatever you
  do, keep your nerve, and I'll have you out before you know what's
  happening."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" the girl said, and in a voice so astonishingly cool that
  Brogden was fairly startled for a moment. "I haven't the remotest idea who
  you are, but you are rather a comfort. Oh, I'm not going to lose my nerve.
  This sort of adventure is quite in my line."</p>

  <p>Brogden went on marvelling, but said nothing. He wanted all his breath
  now, despite the fact that his task was an easy one, and that the girl was
  doing everything he could desire. He swam on steadily round the point, and
  was drawing into shallow water, when he heard a shout from the cliff, and,
  looking up, saw Hack gesticulating wildly there, utterly indifferent,
  apparently, to the fact that he was in full view of the foe.</p>

  <p>"Get back, you fool!" Brogden panted.</p>

  <p>"Too late," Hack said&mdash;"they've spotted me. They spotted me some time
  ago. And they've got a Maxim gun yonder! Heaven knows where they got it from,
  but it's there!"</p>

  <p>Surely enough, what might have been a Maxim gun was trailing over the edge
  of the cliff, and what appeared to be another one suddenly showed its nose on
  the headland behind the gesticulating figure on the cliff. Already on the
  shelving bit of beach where Brogden intended to land was a band of Indians
  eagerly awaiting his coming.</p>

  <p>They lifted him out of the water and, without further ceremony, rendered
  him helpless with ropes and rawhides. Then a moment or two later Hack,
  downcast and disconsolate, and much in the same sorry case, joined his
  commander.</p>

  <p>They were dragged away up the cliffs to the impromptu camp, where the
  desperadoes were apparently doing themselves remarkably well out of a number
  of picnic baskets flanked by a small regiment of tempting-looking bottles,
  over which the big man in the sombrero effectively presided. He was
  apparently the leader of the gang&mdash;no doubt one of those South Sea
  desperadoes of European origin made familiar to civilisation through the
  medium of Louis Becke and other picturesque writers who have chosen the
  Pacific Ocean for the scenes of their stories.</p>

  <p>For the moment, at any rate, the persecuted heroine had vanished, so had
  the other girl, and the man in the flannel suit was not to be seen.</p>

  <p>"I think that'll about do," the man in the sombrero said, and immediately
  the two Maxim guns on either side of the camp vanished. "I think that'll do.
  Here, Joe, cut away those bonds and offer these gentlemen the hospitality of
  the circus."</p>

  <p>"You want us to drink with you?" Brogden said. "Do you mean to say that
  you have the infernal cheek&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, cut it out!" the chief pirate said genially. "You don't understand,
  of course. One of our chaps spotted you some time ago, but I didn't come
  round and exchange cards because, you see, we were busy. And when I saw what
  you were up to, then I let you go on, because it seemed to me that you'd
  embroidered some on our original scenario, and I guess we're always open to
  hints from intelligent strangers. Say, young man, you're a bit of a dandy
  with a gun, aren't you? When we saw what you were going to do, I didn't
  interfere, because I'm some of a sportsman myself, and I was ready to bet
  long odds you couldn't cut that rope at two hundred yards with rifle bullet.
  Well, yoa did, and I've got a record of it on the film&mdash; the thing that
  you took to be a Maxim gun. Guess you mistook a cinematograph apparatus for a
  weapon, eh? Well, it was a dandy shot, and it's going to improve our film
  some. You can see what our game was, but yours was a darned sight better, and
  if the Broad Highway Film Company have got any sense of gratitude&mdash;why,
  I guess they'll call you part-author of this big new film of ours, and see
  that you get a handsome royalty."</p>

  <p>Brogden sat there with a cold, white light steadily filtering its way to
  the back of his intelligence.</p>

  <p>"So that's the game, is it?" he asked. "Well, you fairly put it over my
  friend, Mr. Larry Hack, and myself. Yes, I see it's quite all right&mdash;I
  see, on closer acquaintance, that your wild Indians are all duds. But what on
  earth are you doing here? Why did you come all this way?"</p>

  <p>"Local colour, my dear sir, local colour," the big man said. "The finest
  and most realistic firm in the world is the Broad Highway Film Company. And
  we're working on a big drama now that's going to make little old New York sit
  up and take nourishment. There's ten million dollars behind our firm, and the
  universe has got to know it. And round yonder point is a regular
  cinematograph ship that's taken us half round the world. I guess it'll be the
  finest panoramic effect ever seen on the screen, and it'll take two years to
  complete. Now, say, mister, did you ever hear of an actress called Crystal
  Rays, and another called Maizie Corn? Well, the first-named star is the lady
  you pulled out of the water, and the other one you haven't seen yet, and the
  dude in the flannel suit is our leading man. Some cast, eh?"</p>

  <p>"You're right there," Brogden laughed, "I'm from New York, and I know. You
  might introduce me."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, with pleasure, and the artist with the Winchester, the genius
  who's given us a new sensation in the shape of a thrilling picture. Look
  here, my champion shot, if you want an engagement at five hundred dollars a
  week with the Broad Highway Company&mdash;why, it's yours!"</p><br>

     name="story6">6.&mdash;THE CASE FOR THE PRISONER</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Queenslander</i>, Brisbane, Australia, 1 Sep
  1917</h3><br>

  <p class="first">ELLIS, standing in the doorway, gave a little sigh of
  admiration, with perhaps a tinge of envy in it. He could see a room half in
  shadow and half in the subdued light of the shaded lamps, a flicker of blue
  and orange from the clear fire, and by the side of it a woman, lying back in
  a deep, cosy chair.</p>

  <p>Colonel Henderson's wife owned frankly to 40 years, and perhaps all the
  more joyously because she looked at least a decade younger. Her face lighted
  up now and again, and her lips parted in a smile at some remark by the man
  who sat at her side, with his long legs stretched out towards the cheerful
  blaze.</p>

  <p>Colonel Henderson was a good ten years older than his wife, though she
  refused to admit it. He was a fine figure of a man, lean and well-knit, and
  his hair and moustache bore no trace of grey. Yet he had seen hard service in
  many lands, and his D.S.O. had been fairly won during the Boer War.</p>

  <p>Ellis advanced into the room, and made his presence known. It was good to
  see the light of pleasure in Molly Henderson's blue eyes, and feel the grip
  of the Colonel's hand. It was good to sit there facing the cheerful blaze and
  listen to news of mutual friends. Then gradually the conversation lapsed, as
  it will between friends, and a long silence followed. It was Ellis who broke
  it first.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "you have not asked me how the search has
  progressed."</p>

  <p>The Colonel shrugged his shoulders just a little impatiently. "Oh, the
  Odyssey," he said. "Aeneas in search of the sentimental idea. My dear fellow,
  I have never had any sympathy with this scheme at all. To begin with, I can
  see nothing to be gained by it. Your brother is dead. And he has lain under
  the veldt now for nearly 13 years. His wife may be dead, too, for all you
  know. For the sake of argument, let us grant that she isn't. Say you find
  her, what are you going to do then?"</p>

  <p>"Give her back that money," Ellis said. "It belonged to her, and I shall
  never be satisfied till she has the whole 20 thousand back again."</p>

  <p>"Wasn't it more than that?" Henderson asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, at one time it was, much more. We heard from Capetown that my
  brother was married, and that his wife had settled her money on him, but my
  mother and myself would not have known her if we had met her in the street.
  Well, she left her husband, heaven knows why, and Philip was heartbroken
  about it. Then the Boer War broke out, and we gathered from my brother's
  letters that his wife was entirely in sympathy with the foe. Finally he was
  left alone, defending his farm with perhaps a couple of English men, and
  supplying Kitchener with valuable information. And what did that woman do?
  She left the farm at dead of night, and deliberately betrayed her husband
  into the hand of the foe. They shot him as he was writing home to tell my
  mother this, and the unfinished letter reached us in due course. And you
  laugh at me because I have made it the business of my life to find that woman
  and give her money back to her. Is not that so?"</p>

  <p>"Well?" Henderson said, half wearily. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"Well, I am going to make a deliberate accusation against you, George. I
  am going to challenge you to deny that you know where Philip's wife is to be
  found."</p>

  <p>Molly Henderson lifted a smiling, questioning face to her husband.</p>

  <p>He smiled in turn. "I am not going to deny it," he said. "I can't&mdash;at
  least, not till Geoffrey has produced his proofs."</p>

  <p>"I can do that," Ellis said, grimly. "Now, as you know, I have been
  travelling about the Transvaal, hunting for information for the last two
  years. But the war had removed so many landmarks. Whole families had been
  wiped out, and people disappeared in the most mysterious manner. Then I got
  hold of a Cape boy, an old man who remembered my brother, and he took me to
  the farm, where he died. In one of the ruined buildings I discovered a mass
  of documents in my brother's handwriting. And amongst them was a common
  luggage label. It was written by a woman and addressed to Colonel George
  Henderson at Paarburg, to be called for, and the initials in the corner were
  those of my brother's wife. A date is on that label, the very day that the
  woman I am in search of abandoned her husband to his fate. And if you want
  any more, let the thing speak for itself."</p>

  <p>Very quietly Ellis laid the torn slip of paper on the table. Henderson
  picked it up and examined it carefully.</p>

  <p>"I am not denying anything," he said. "I should say, without a doubt, that
  that label was addressed by your brother's wife, and it would be futile to
  deny that I am the Colonel Henderson in question."</p>

  <p>"Then she did write to you!" Ellis cried, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"You can't force me to speak, you know," Henderson said. "For many reasons
  I deplore this discovery of yours, and yet I cannot tell you why. Give it up,
  Geoffrey. If that money weighs on your conscience, give it me, and I will see
  that it reaches its destination. The woman you seek doesn't want it; indeed,
  I know that she wouldn't touch a penny of it. And I warn you that you will
  not get any further."</p>

  <p>Ellis listened in moody silence, and then turned eagerly to Molly
  Henderson for sympathy.</p>

  <p>"Won't you help me?" he implored. "Dear Molly, George cannot resist you,
  if you ask him."</p>

  <p>"I do ask him," Mrs. Henderson whispered.</p>

  <p>Henderson bent and touched his wife's forehead gently. "Listen," he said.
  "A woman comes to me in the hour of her distress, and appeals to me for
  protection. Does it matter whether she is good or bad; does anything matter
  beyond the fact that she is a woman? She came to me, knowing that I was
  prejudiced against her. She came in peril, with the stigma of the spy upon
  her. And because she appealed for my protection I gave it her, and I have
  never regretted it. You know that, Molly, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"We have discussed the matter many times," Mrs. Henderson said, with a
  little catch in her voice. "Don't think we are callous or heartless,
  Geoffrey. We have not deliberately deceived you. We always hoped that you
  would forget, and that one of these days some nice girl&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's a nice girl, now," Ellis said, moodily. "But you know I cannot
  speak to her yet."</p>

  <p>"You are a fool," Henderson broke out. "A sentimental fool, who is wasting
  his life in the pursuit of shadows. And with that I have no more to say."</p>

  <p>"I will make one more appeal to you," Ellis persisted. "You suggested just
  now that there might be a girl somewhere for me, and I have told you that
  there is. You say you are anxious for my future happiness, and yet all the
  time you are doing your best to prevent it."</p>

  <p>There was something like pity in Henderson's smile, something sad in the
  expression in Molly's face.</p>

  <p>"Well, Molly!" Henderson asked. "Geoffrey has made an appeal to you. What
  are you going to say?"</p>

  <p>"It would be far kinder to say nothing," Molly Henderson murmured, after a
  moment's hesitation. "As you suggested just now, let sleeping dogs lie."</p>

  <p>"But why?" Ellis protested. "Can't you see what a living tragedy the thing
  is to me?"</p>

  <p>"Supposing you were a woman who had done something in the past and had
  suffered for it," Henderson suggested. "It is always the woman who suffers,
  you know, always the woman who pays. She may be living out her life in some
  remote part of the world, she may be the wife of some good fellow who knows
  nothing of that closed volume. She may be absolutely and entirely happy. You
  wouldn't grudge her that happiness?"</p>

  <p>"What decent fellow would?" Ellis asked. "But is this fact or fable?"</p>

  <p>"It's founded on fact, any way. And don't run away with the impression
  that your brother's case is unique, because more than one Englishman with a
  Dutch wife paid a similar penalty during that campaign. And the Boers are our
  blood brothers to-day, mind. I am going to ask you to listen to my story, and
  perhaps, when I have finished, you will not be so anxious to injure a person
  whom you have never seen, and who is known to you only by the name of Ruth
  Ellis."</p>

  <p>"The story is worth listening to," Mrs. Henderson murmured.</p>

  <p>"I will go back to a few months before the war," Henderson began. "I was
  in Cape Colony, remember, before the fighting began. And there I met a man
  whom I will call Trevor. He was a very charming and delightful fellow, a
  typical, well-bred Englishman, with the public school hall-mark upon him. He
  had plenty of ambition; perhaps he was a little too ambitious, for he
  rejected one or two excellent openings on the ground that they were not good
  enough. As a matter of fact, he was wasting his money, and was just a little
  too much inclined to spend his evenings in the club billiard-room, when he
  met a girl. I didn't know her then, but I heard she was a good type, and that
  her people were wealthy. They got married, and went up country, precisely as
  your brother did. I heard from him from time to time, though I never met his
  wife. You see, it was just then that we in the army began to see the red
  light ahead, and very full our hands were in consequence. But I did not lose
  interest in Trevor, and he wrote to me frequently. He was always the type of
  man to show his feelings; he belonged to the emotional class that must have
  sympathy. His letters gradually changed in tone; he was not getting on with
  his wife. He complained that she was frivolous and thoughtless, and fond of
  admiration. She hated the lonely life; there were violent quarrels and
  passionate scenes, and very vividly they were described. Trevor was a born
  novelist&mdash;anybody who read the letters would have known that. And I am
  bound to say that I took them all for gospel. They were deucedly
  convincing.</p>

  <p>"I got those letters regularly," Henderson went on. "'They culminated some
  months later after the war broke out, with the declaration that the woman had
  left her husband and gone back to Capetown. After a bit, she was back again;
  indeed, the same thing happened twice more, and then Trevor was killed by a
  handful of wandering Boers during one of his wife's periodical absences. I
  thought I'd heard the last of her, but I was mistaken. Late one night an
  orderly came to me with the information that a woman had called on important
  business. It was a queer place for a woman, that desolate region, and I must
  confess that my curiosity was aroused; so the lady came into my tent, and
  introduced herself as Mrs. Trevor.</p>

  <p>"She was quite candid; she knew perfectly well what her husband had
  written to me, for she had read every line of his letters before they were
  despatched. She spoke utterly without bitterness; she spoke as one who had
  suffered in silence at the hands of a madman. It was the old, old story.
  Trevor had taken to drink&mdash;the worst type of drunkard, the man who has
  savage spells with sober interludes. Geoffrey, I cannot convey to you in as
  many words what that poor woman had suffered. She had never left the man of
  her own accord, she had stood by him as long as it was safe; and had fought
  for his soul. And when she fled in fear of her life, and Trevor was writing
  whining to me and cadging for sympathy, he was sending her the most
  passionate and imploring letters, promising her anything if she'd only
  return. And her return from time to time was none the less noble, because he
  had killed all her love long ago. She was with him to the end. It came after
  a scene of violence greater than any that had preceded it, and she, a woman,
  was left all alone on the veldt. Trevor was shot at daybreak by the roaming
  Boers I speak of, and, at the last moment, conveyed an impression to me that
  he had been the victim of treachery on the part of his wife. But I know
  better; I have chapter and verse for everything I am telling you in my safe
  yonder. I don't suppose you would care to see it, and, in any case, it is no
  business of yours. And I think that's about all, Geoffrey."</p>

  <p>Ellis looked up with a lack-lustre eye. He only dimly comprehended what
  all this was leading to.</p>

  <p>"A sad story," he murmured. "But I don't see the application of it. It
  sounds like poor Phil's life over again, in a slightly different form. But,
  then, poor old Phil did not drink, and he would not have hurt a fly. Good
  heavens! you're not insinuating&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are very blind, Geoffrey," Mrs. Henderson whispered.</p>

  <p>Ellis collapsed trembling into a chair. "Heavens! Is it true?" he cried.
  "Is it true that all these years I have been sacrificing my life for one so
  unworthy? But it must be true. Forgive me, Molly, for all the pain I have
  inflicted upon the one woman who, after my mother, I love best in the world.
  And how am I going to tell her the truth?"</p>

  <p>"Why tell her at all?" Molly Henderson whispered. "Phil's wife is dead.
  Ruth Ellis died of a broken heart, and lies in her grave out there on the
  veldt, Molly Henderson, thank heaven, is a different person altogether. And
  now, Geoffrey&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ellis advanced towards the speaker and placed his hands on hers. Then he
  lifted them to his lips. "Everything is buried on the veldt," he said. "And
  you will never hear me mention this again. I should like to come back in a
  day or two, when I feel more able&mdash;you know what I mean. And if I leave
  you now I am quite sure."</p>

  <p>He was gone. The door closed behind him.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">Henderson laid his hands on his wife's shoulders, and looked
  down into her eyes. "That was brave of you," he said. "He would never have
  got the story from me. Still, if you think it is for the best&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Molly Henderson smiled. "It is good for him that he should hear
  the case for the prisoner. And I am sure I shall never regret that the story
  has been told. Geoffrey will tell nobody, not even the girl who is waiting
  for him. And, George, I think it was for her sake that the story was
  told."</p><br>

     name="story7">7.&mdash;THE BLACK PRINCE</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY A. GILBERT</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, Oct 1916</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE car came leisurely down the road, and a pleasant-faced
  young man stepped on to the wooden platform and accosted the distinguished
  antiquarian respectfully.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Donald McPhail, I think," he said. "I am Raymond Welton. Sir John
  Denmark asked me to come and meet you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed," the famous traveller and antiquarian said. "I haven't seen
  my old friend, Sir John, for three years; in fact, I don't believe I wrote to
  him after I went to Mexico. When you are buried out yonder a hundred miles
  from a town, amongst those Aztec ruins, it is not an easy matter to transmit
  letters. I hope that nothing serious is the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not as far as Sir John and Miss Denmark are concerned," Welton
  explained. "But it's a ghastly business. Miss Denmark has not been well the
  last few days, and her maid, Lydia Wrench, has been sleeping in her
  mistress's dressing-room, so as to be handy in case anything happened.
  Yesterday morning the maid was found dead in her bed. A doctor from Plymouth
  who had been called in to make the autopsy was utterly puzzled as to the
  cause of death. So Sir John asked me to come and meet you, and he hoped that
  you would not mind putting up at my cottage till the funeral is over. And
  besides, I shall be honoured if you will come. You see, I am by way of being
  a novelist, and Miss Denmark and I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are Welton, are you?" McPhail asked. "I know your mystery stories
  quite well. What's the name of that book of yours in which you introduce an
  Egyptian scarab? Have you got anything of the kind on hand just now?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I have," Welton said. "And I was going to ask you to help me,
  because it is all about those mysterious Aztecs, and there's no living soul
  who knows more about those strange people than you do. At the British Museum
  I stumbled on an old manuscript written something after the Munchausen style
  by a traveller who professed to have been out in Mexico, in the Aztec
  country. There was some wild legend about a butterfly called the Black
  Prince. Of course, it is all fiction, but the idea appealed to me so strongly
  that I am making it the central idea in my new story."</p>

  <p>"So you think the manuscript is all romance, do you?" McPhail asked,
  quietly. "You are quite right, Welton. There is no man alive who knows so
  much of the Aztecs as I do. I am very sorry to hear about Denmark's trouble,
  and it is exceedingly good of you to put me up. As an old traveller I am
  quite used to roughing it."</p>

  <p>Raymond Welton's cottage was no more than the owner claimed for it, but it
  was neat and clean, and the famous traveller's tiny bedroom looked out over
  the wide Atlantic that broke on the sands six hundred feet below. After a
  substantial meal McPhail lay back in a big basket-chair, smoking the coarse
  tobacco that his soul loved, and chatting confidentially with his young host,
  to whom he had taken a sincere liking.</p>

  <p>"Most people would find it rather lonely down here," the professor said.
  "Not that I quarrel with that. By the way, who lives in that black old house
  on the brow yonder?"</p>

  <p>"That's called Ravenshoe," Welton explained. "It was inhabited by a famous
  smuggler, whose dark exploits are still talked of by the fishermen. It was a
  fine place at one time, but only about half the house remains now. The man
  who lives there is a nephew of Sir John Denmark, and is, in fact, the only
  child of Sir John's dead sister. He's a queer and mysterious sort of man,
  very quiet and reserved, and no one knows much about him, except that he's
  supposed to be connected with some London finance companies. He bought
  Ravenshoe two years ago, when his wife left him, and he spends about half his
  time down here. According to Sir John he is an object of pity. I understand
  he was passionately attached to his wife, who simply walked out of the house
  one afternoon and declined to come back. More than that, she refused ever to
  see him again, or to explain her conduct to anyone. Curiously enough, it was
  this same Julian Rama&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What name did you say?" McPhail asked, suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Rama. Queer name, isn't it? Julian Rama's father was a Spaniard from
  Mexico, and, I understand, claims direct descent from Acamapichtle, who was
  the second king of the Aztecs. Sir John says that Rama has a number of old
  Aztec manuscripts proving his claim, but these, I believe, he declines to
  show to anyone. When he hears who you are perhaps he will change his mind,
  though I doubt it."</p>

  <p>"So do I," McPhail said, dryly. "However, that's neither here nor there.
  Would you mind, Welton, saying nothing of this, I mean as to who I am, to Mr.
  Rama for the present? It is just possible he has never heard of me."</p>

  <p>"As to that, I can't say," Welton replied; "you'd better ask Sir John. At
  any rate, all I know is that it was when I heard Mr. Rama's story that I
  first conceived the idea of writing a novel round a mysterious man descended
  from the Aztecs, and who knows all the black magic and dark traditions which
  have been handed down from that mysterious race. To my mind they are quite as
  fascinating as the ancient Egyptian."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, yes," McPhail burst out, suddenly. "I should say they are. All
  the wickedness of Tyre and Sidon and Sodom and Gomorrah and Babylon is
  wrapped up and packed away in the secret history of the Aztecs. The evil
  spirit called Tlactecolototl, which these people more or less worshipped,
  had, I firmly believe, at one time a being in flesh. I tell you, I've seen
  things myself. I have materialized certain essences and incorporate bodies,
  and have produced from them results which have made me loathe myself. But you
  mustn't run away with the impression that this Julian Rama knows as much as I
  do. Unless he has been out there, as I have done, he couldn't. Probably those
  documents are merely so many letters to him, and I have no doubt that he is
  proud of his own descent."</p>

  <p>McPhail changed the subject abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me, as a matter of curiosity, were there any marks of violence
  on the body of the unfortunate girl who died so mysteriously?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"None whatever. I saw the poor girl as she lay in bed on her right side,
  and she seemed to have died peacefully in her sleep. There was nothing to be
  seen, as far as I could judge, beyond two tiny little marks behind the left
  ear, no bigger than the point of a needle. They were little reddish specks,
  white at the base, as if a gnat had stung her. You've got two such marks on
  the back of your own hand at the present moment."</p>

  <p>McPhail glanced hurriedly at his hand, and then he smiled a curious
  twisted smile that showed his teeth.</p>

  <p>"You are a curiously observant young man," he said. "And now, shouldn't we
  walk as far as Porth Place? I should like, at any rate, just to call and see
  my old friends."</p>

  <p>The blinds were drawn in the long windows and the visitors found Sir John
  Denmark and his daughter pacing up and down the lawn. They welcomed McPhail
  cordially and insisted upon his coming into the house.</p>

  <p>"You'll find us rather subdued at the present moment," the old
  Anglo-Indian said. "But, of course, Welton has told you all about it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," McPhail explained. "A most mysterious case, from all accounts.
  I wonder if you'd mind if I had a look at the unfortunate girl who died so
  mysteriously."</p>

  <p>"Well, I&mdash;I don't see why you shouldn't," the startled baronet
  exclaimed. "The poor child is still lying on her bed, and I'll take you up if
  you like."</p>

  <p>McPhail followed bravely into the darkened room and proceeded to pull up
  the blind. Then he bent over the body and examined the dead features
  carefully with the aid of a strong glass which he took from his waistcoat
  pocket. His flint-blue eyes were bent intently on the tiny little specks
  under the dead girl's ear. But they were tiny specks no longer: they had
  developed into little red marks, capped with irregular scars, deep red, with
  a blue ring at the base.</p>

  <p>"My God," McPhail whispered. "So that is it! Thank Heaven, I seem to have
  got here in time."</p>

  <p>The door of the little cottage was thrown wide open so that the light from
  Welton's reading lamp shone out towards the sea. He had just thrown aside his
  pen with a gesture of disgust when McPhail came quietly in.</p>

  <p>"You have been very patient for the last few days," he said. "And now, my
  dear Welton, if you have any questions to ask, fire away."</p>

  <p>"A hundred," Welton said. "It is five evenings now since I accompanied you
  into the bedroom of that unfortunate girl, Lydia Wrench. And I saw how deeply
  you were moved, though I don't think anybody else did. At your suggestion I
  got Sir John out of the room, and you proceeded to remove one of those tiny
  sores from the girl's face and put it in your pocket-book. Can you wonder,
  therefore, that I was curious?"</p>

  <p>"Go on," McPhail murmured; "go on."</p>

  <p>"Then you asked all sorts of questions. You wanted to know if the
  dressing-room door was open all night, and whether the door leading into Miss
  Denmark's bedroom was closed or not. You wanted to know if Miss Denmark's
  windows were open, and she told you they were. And when Miss Denmark told you
  that she always pinned her window curtains together in the summer time,
  because she hated nocturnal moths and insects, and because she had got into
  the habit of doing that sort of thing in India, you were considerably
  relieved. Also, you suggested to her that she should keep the doors of her
  bedroom and dressing-room locked."</p>

  <p>"Quite so, Welton," McPhail said. "The death of that poor girl was a mere
  accident; the pestilence that moved by night was not meant for her at all,
  but for Daphne Denmark. The mere fact that the girl was sleeping in the
  dressing-room was unknown to the monster that we have to fight. The danger is
  close at hand now; it will come as soon as the fading moon is well on the
  horizon. Therefore the enemy has to move, because he can do nothing unless
  the weather is hot and fine. I told Sir John that I was going out
  moth-hunting, and asked him if he would leave one of the windows open so that
  I could get back into the house. So, as soon as the moon is fairly high, you
  are going back with me to Porth Place, and we are going to watch and wait for
  the unseen terror of the night. We shall creep quietly into the house and
  take our places in the corridor where Sir John keeps his pictures. I have got
  an electric torch, and I can lend you one too. And make no mistake of the
  danger. I don't wish to frighten you, but there it is. And that's the sort of
  thing that tries people's nerve."</p>

  <p>"All the same I am quite ready," Welton said, quietly. "I am fighting for
  the woman I love, and for the woman who loves me. I'd do anything for
  Daphne."</p>

  <p>"I know. Now, if anything happened to Sir John, and especially if anything
  happened to Daphne, where would the bulk of the Denmark money go to?"</p>

  <p>"Why, to Rama, of course. But you don't suggest that a man who is already
  married, and has a wife living&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I suggest nothing. I have been making inquiries; in fact, I've kept the
  telegraph office at St. Enoc busy during the last few days. You may be
  surprised to hear that Julian Rama is in desperate need of a thousand
  pounds."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed," Welton exclaimed. "Is that why Rama has been in town all the
  week?"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, he hasn't been in town at all. He's been here all the
  time. Like you, he lives all alone, at Ravenshoe, so that he can come and go
  as he likes, and a man who runs a motor-cycle as he does has only to disguise
  himself in goggles so that he might pass, even in the village, as a wandering
  tourist. I am going to show you something to-night that you have never seen
  before. On the face of it it is nothing but a photograph of a fresco on an
  old Aztec temple. That fresco I destroyed, but I took this photograph first.
  Isn't it good?"</p>

  <p>The photograph displayed the figure of a woman in Aztec robes lying at
  full length upon a couch with a hard, white face turned upwards. On one
  temple something seemed to have perched, something that looked like the
  petals of a fallen flower, till Welton came to examine it more carefully, and
  then he saw that it was a gigantic butterfly. There was something weird, and
  yet so repulsive about it, that Welton shuddered as he gazed at it.</p>

         title="Welton shuddered as he gazed at it.">
  </div>

  <p>"There is a horrible suggestion about the whole thing," he said. "But it
  conveys nothing to me."</p>

  <p>"It will later on," McPhail said, grimly. "My friend, that's the Black
  Prince. But come on, we are wasting time here. By the way, have you got any
  more of that honey that you gave me for tea last night? If so, you might
  bring a section with you."</p>

  <p>Like two burglars they crept into the hall of Sir John's house and up into
  the gallery. Not a sound did they make, not a sign of their presence did they
  give, except just once, when McPhail flashed a ray from his electric torch in
  the direction of one of the bedrooms, after which he proceeded to deposit the
  section of honeycomb upon the mat outside.</p>

  <p>"Sit there," he whispered. "On that oak chest. And take this long-handled
  Oriental fan in your hand. I have got one too&mdash;in fact, I've borrowed
  them off the wall yonder for the purpose. I'll take my place on the chest on
  the other side of the corridor, and when the time comes I'll give the signal.
  Only you're not to make the slightest noise. When I say the word, turn on
  your electric-torch and thrash about in the air with your fan as if your life
  depended upon it. I may tell you that it probably does. Now, then."</p>

  <p>The electric torch was extinguished, and for a time the two men sat there
  breathing heavily in the violet darkness. And so it went on for an hour or
  more, till Welton could feel himself tingle in every nerve, until he felt
  that he must either rise from his seat and walk about or scream aloud.</p>

  <p>And then, suddenly, a queer humming sound broke the intense silence. It
  was as if a gentle steady breeze was blowing against a highly-strung wire, or
  as if the two were listening to the dying vibrations of a tuning-fork. It was
  not a great noise, but in the darkness and silence of the place it struck on
  Welton's ears with a force that set him trembling in every nerve. It seemed
  to be all round and about, sometimes up in the roof of the gallery, and then
  again within a foot of Welton's grey, ghastly face. Then to his relief
  McPhail spoke.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said. "For Heaven's sake, now!"</p>

  <p>Welton sprang to his feet and thrashed the dark with the long-handled fan
  till his arm ached and the perspiration rolled down his cheeks. He was dimly
  conscious that McPhail was doing the same thing, and then suddenly the
  professor ceased and a long white ray from the electric torch cut into the
  darkness. Then something seemed to hum and vibrate, something dazzling in
  purple and red, and a splendour of spangled gold, followed by the dull impact
  of some flying body as it came suddenly against a downward sweep of McPhail's
  fan. For the first time McPhail spoke aloud.</p>

  <p>"Got him!" he croaked, in a voice as hoarse as the drone of a circular
  saw. "Got him! He's past all danger now. Come and have a look, Welton;
  there's nothing to be afraid of."</p>

  <p><a id="pic8"
     name="pic8"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1301061h-images/TheBlackPrince2.jpg"
         title="'Got him!' he croaked.">
  </div><br>

  <p>Down there on the floor was a huddled mass of some fluffy material, a
  mangled heap of beauty and colour all blended into one shining and sticky
  mass.</p>

  <p>"The Black Prince," McPhail explained, hoarsely. "The most damnably
  beautiful thing that ever came out of hell."</p>

  <p>"But what is it?" Welton whispered.</p>

  <p>"I can't explain here; and, anyway, we haven't finished yet. No, for
  Heaven's sake, don't touch it. There is nothing more exquisitely beautiful or
  more deadly poisonous on the face of the earth. And now do you understand
  what has been worrying me?"</p>

  <p>"That devil Rama," Welton exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Of course. Now just wait a minute whilst I get a pair of thick gloves and
  remove all traces of that hideous mess. Then we'll go as far as Ravenshoe and
  have this matter out. Unless I am greatly mistaken we shall find the
  scoundrel at home."</p>

  <p>As the two men walked through the moonlight, McPhail proceeded to
  enlighten his companion.</p>

  <p>"It's like this," he explained. "In the ordinary circumstances you would
  never have got anything out of me about the Black Prince, though, of course,
  I was interested to hear that you had found that old manuscript at the
  British Museum. But when you told me all about Rama and the tragedy at Porth
  Place, then, I must confess, I was disturbed. That's why I asked to have a
  look at the unfortunate woman. And one glance convinced me that she had
  fallen a victim to perhaps the most insidious and powerful poison in the
  world."</p>

  <p>"What do you call it?" Welton asked.</p>

  <p>"Terafine. It is only found in one insect, and that is the Black Prince. I
  told Professor Skelton about it a year or two ago, and he made certain
  investigations on specimens supplied by me, and up to now those
  investigations are a profound secret. I recognized terafine at once, and the
  professor confirmed my opinion when he placed that little scab I sent him
  under the microscope. Then I knew beyond doubt how the girl had died, and I
  began to make further inquiries into the career of Julian Rama. I found that
  he was absent frequently in South America on mysterious errands which he said
  were in connection with a mining concession. And here he doubtless came
  across the Black Prince. And I found it myself; ah, yes!"</p>

  <p>McPhail's voice trailed off for a moment into a hoarse whisper, and the
  old horror crept into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to dwell upon that time," he said. "Sometimes I dream of it
  in the night and wake up wet and cold. But yet I cannot wipe out of my mind
  the recollection of that evening in the old ruined temple, covered with
  creepers and orchids, where I first met the Black Prince&mdash;met it on the
  fourth night, under the light of the full moon; when I was watching all alone
  I saw the infernal thing. I saw a dozen of them, disporting themselves round
  the remains of a hive of honey which we had taken from a decayed tree. And I
  fought them, as in the old days they fought the wild beasts at Ephesus. I
  killed them all, and I buried them whilst my natives slept. I did not want my
  people to find that the legend was true; but from that day on I never entered
  an Aztec ruin except in the daylight. And now you know why I asked all those
  questions, and why I asked Sir John not to identify me with McPhail the
  antiquary. I didn't want Rama to know who I was, and I don't think he
  guesses. Come, let us get along, because our night's work is not finished
  yet."</p>

  <p>As they pushed up the slope in the direction of Ravenshoe a fisherman came
  hurrying along the cliff and pulled up as Welton hailed him by name.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Tyre?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It's a bad thing that's happened," the fisherman said. "I was going along
  the cliffs just now, in the direction of Marham, when I see a big car coming
  up the road with three men in it. One of them was Mr. Pascoe, over to Bodmin,
  who's Chief of Police there. And from what I could gather the other two were
  from London, and they had a warrant for Mr. Rama's arrest."</p>

  <p>"Then he is a prisoner?" Welton asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, no, sir; not in a manner of speaking. Mr. Rama, he must have been
  looking out for them, for when the car was a quarter of a mile away he comes
  dashing along on his motor-bicycle down the road and the car pushed on to cut
  him off. Then Mr. Rama, he swerves round over the headland yonder, so as to
  make a loop and gain the far side of the Marham Road, which takes him over
  the slippery grass down the side of the slope, and just then he turns
  quickly, and over goes the motor-bike and him with the cycle together down
  the cliff into the sea beyond. I was on my way to tell Sir John."</p>

  <p><a id="pic9"
     name="pic9"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1301061h-images/TheBlackPrince3.jpg"
         title="'Over goes the motor-bike...'">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Oh, we'll do that," Welton said. "You go down to the beach and see if you
  can be of any assistance."</p>

  <p>As the fisherman vanished McPhail pushed on.</p>

  <p>"Come along," he said. "We are not likely to be interrupted, and I
  couldn't sleep to-night till I have been all over that house. I am not fool
  enough to believe that that monster Rama has exhausted his supply with two of
  those loathsome insects. They are tropical insects, and could not live for
  long in a climate like ours, except in torrid weather, and only then when the
  moon is in the second quarter. But we have had some very hot nights lately,
  except for three evenings this week; and this afternoon it was so warm that I
  knew an attempt would be made to-night. And I was right."</p>

  <p>"But if those things are so dangerous to handle?"</p>

  <p>"Not to a man who is used to knocking about in motor attire. Mackintoshes
  and masks and thick gloves not only served Rama as a disguise, but acted as a
  protection as well. He stole down to Porth Place to-night with one of those
  infernal moths in a box; he had previously, no doubt, smeared the transom
  over the bedroom floor with honey, and the big window in the gallery was
  open. And now, come along and let us wipe out all records."</p>

  <p>There was no difficulty whatever in getting into Ravenshoe, for the front
  door stood wide open, giving on the big hall of the deserted house and the
  dining-room beyond, where a lighted paraffin lamp stood on the table. In one
  corner of the room was a safe, the door of which was ajar, and this was
  crammed with old manuscripts covered with quaint inscriptions that McPhail's
  experienced eye immediately recognized as Aztec.</p>

  <p>"There, what did I tell you?" he said. "Clear that safe out and push all
  the documents into that sack lying in the corner. Then open the windows and
  throw it out, and we'll come and recover it in the morning. Upstairs, I
  think."</p>

  <p>They made their way up the wide staircase and searched every room there
  with the aid of their electric torches. McPhail appeared to be dissatisfied
  until, presently, he came to a door let into the oak panelling, a door with a
  catch and button on the outside which he proceeded to open. On the other side
  of the oak barrier was a network of fine steel in the form of a mesh, and
  from the room itself gushed a warm odour of hot steam which was mingled
  queerly with a faint sweet odour that seemed to fill the whole
  atmosphere.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said McPhail. "Here we are!"</p>

  <p>He turned the brilliant lane of light from his torch upon the prison house
  behind the steel mesh, and almost immediately there arose that peculiar sharp
  humming musical note that Welton had noticed an hour or so before in the
  corridor of Porth Place. Then a shadow seemed to fall from the roof, and
  poised motionless with wings whirring so fast that they hardly seemed to
  move, and in that instant Welton was gazing with fascinated eyes at the most
  beautiful thing he had ever seen.</p>

  <p>It was a great moth, some ten inches across the wings, velvet black as to
  the body, with a broad band of royal purple exquisitely patterned like fine
  lace. Towards the base of the wings the blackness shaded away to a pale blue
  and the long body glowed beneath a mass of vermilion-coloured hair. On the
  head was an irregular star-shaped mark that might have been a tiny indented
  crown of pure gold. The great eyes of the moth trembled and scintillated like
  opals. It was at once beautiful, and yet sinister and repelling. It hovered
  there just for a minute or two, then fluttered lightly to the floor with
  wings outspread as if half-conscious of the admiration that it had created.
  And yet, alluring and beautiful as it was, Welton shuddered from head to foot
  as he regarded it.</p>

  <p>"There," said McPhail. "So far as I know, only three men have ever gazed
  upon its like before. It is an exquisite thing, and yet deadly poisonous, as
  you know. Just one touch of that crimson body, and you would be a dead man
  within five minutes. It seems a pity to make an end of such a beauty, but it
  must be done."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" Welton asked.</p>

  <p>"Burn the infernal place down," McPhail shouted. "Destroy it. Wipe it off
  the face of the earth. Probably if I turn the steam off, those moths will be
  all dead by morning; the chrysalids and caterpillars would perish, but I am
  taking no risks so long as this hot weather lasts. If hell opens and looks
  you in the face, blot it out. Smother it, and destroy it. Now, come with me
  down to the garage and we'll find a can of petrol and soak the dining-room
  with it. Don't you think it's the proper thing to do in the
  circumstances?"</p>

  <p>"I'm with you," Welton said, between his teeth. "The whole thing is
  incredible; the sort of thing that could only happen in the pages of a
  book."</p>

  <p>"And you're the man to write it," McPhail said, as a little later he
  tossed a blazing match through the dining-room window on to the petrol-soaked
  floor. "Here's a plot that nobody will believe, though you'll get every
  credit for your powers of imagination. And after all, it's a sound saying
  that truth is stranger than fiction."</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY A. GILBERT</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XLVI, Nov 1917, pp
  595-599</h3><br>

  <p class="first">A DISTINGUISHED novelist, who would rather make an epigram
  than a friend, always declared that Mrs. Harcourt's flat in Lowndes Gardens
  reminded him of one of the brilliant stage settings usually associated with a
  St. James's production, which description had just enough truth in it to
  carry a sting in its tail. And, indeed, perhaps there was just a suggestion
  of that glittering artificiality surrounding the home life of the famous
  actress in question, just a little bit too much gold and colouring; but the
  young man standing there, with his back to the flower-filled fireplace,
  noticed nothing of it.</p>

  <p>He was not in a condition just then to notice anything but the glamour of
  the moment, for was he not taking Cecil Marne out to dinner, and convoying
  her subsequently to the first night of a new play at the Comus? He was good
  enough to look on, was this young man, with his clean-shaven, handsome face,
  lighted with a pair of clear, brown eyes, fearless and resolute, a young man
  with all the world before him and everything in his favour. He was
  beautifully groomed, of course, immaculate and speckless, the finished
  product of Eton and Oxford, just a fine specimen of a typical young
  Englishman, a little tanned and brown&mdash;an athlete, in fact, and
  potentially a leader of men.</p>

  <p>He stood there, glancing carelessly about him, a little impatient and a
  little eager, and, perhaps, just a shade disappointed to find that Cecil was
  not already awaiting him. She came in presently, a dazzling vision of
  loveliness and beauty, clad in some pink diaphanous confection that mere man
  would have found it impossible to describe, but which seemed to be part of
  herself, as a woman's dress ought to be when she knows how to wear it. And it
  was not any particular classicality of outline or amazing regularity of
  feature to which Cecil owed her chief charm; still, it was a beautiful face,
  soulful and intellectual, and flushed with happiness and pleasure just
  now.</p>

  <p>"I hope I haven't kept you waiting," she said, "but Mrs. Harcourt detained
  me. She has just gone."</p>

  <p>"Oh, down to the theatre, I suppose," Alan Chamberlayne said. "Is she very
  nervous?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not just at the last. I would give anything to have a position like
  that."</p>

  <p>"You would like to go on the stage, Cecil?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I should&mdash;it must be glorious. And I believe I could do
  it, Alan. Mrs. Harcourt says so. And, perhaps, some day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wish you wouldn't talk like that," Alan said. "I think you
  know&mdash;you must know by this time&mdash;why I come here so often, Cecil.
  You must know we are something more than friends. Now, don't you?"</p>

  <p>The girl flushed slightly and turned her glowing face away from his. She
  was still at the parting of the ways, still hesitating with the seed of the
  dandelion in her hand, saying to herself: "I love him, I love him not."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well," she said a little petulantly, "aren't you just a little bit
  old-fashioned, Alan?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;perhaps I am," Chamberlayne admitted. "Perhaps, if my
  mother had lived, it might have been different. I suppose I have an
  altogether too exalted idea of womankind. I don't understand them."</p>

  <p>"Does any man?" Cecil laughed. "Do we understand ourselves? And yet you
  are just like all the rest of your sex. You seem to think that a woman's
  mission in life is to marry and settle down."</p>

  <p>"Well, isn't it?" Alan asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, come along!" Cecil said impatiently. "If we are going to dine at the
  Ritz first, the sooner we're off, the better."</p>

  <p>The big car was waiting at the door, and together they drove along the
  streets, in the dusk of the falling September night, in the direction of the
  hotel where they were to dine. They were going on afterwards to the Comus
  Theatre, to see the first performance of the new comedy in which Mrs.
  Harcourt expected to achieve one pf her greatest triumphs. A great night, a
  night to be remembered, and one destined, though Cecil did not know it yet,
  to mark an important turning point in her life.</p>

  <p>And meanwhile here they were at their destination, seated at a little
  table set out for two, with shaded lights and mauve orchids in reckless
  profusion. The place was full of diners, the whole of the big room was
  crowded with youth and beauty, an attractive scene that filled Cecil with
  pleasure, and brought a look of tenderness into those dusky eyes of hers.</p>

  <p>"Do you know," Alan said presently, "that so far you have not met my
  father?"</p>

  <p>"Would he be interested in me?" Cecil smiled.</p>

  <p>"What a question! Of course he would. He knows all about you, and he is
  very anxious to see you. Won't you come down and stay a week-end at our
  place? It's the most delightful old place in the world, and I think my father
  and I value it all the more because we so nearly lost it."</p>

  <p>"I have heard something of it," Cecil said. "Wasn't your father rather
  poor in those early days?"</p>

  <p>"Terribly poor," Chamberlayne said. "He and my mother lived in lodgings in
  an obscure seaside town, trying to save enough money to pay the interest on
  the family mortgages. You see, my father met my mother in Australia, where
  she was on the stage, and married her. Oh, no, she was no great actress, but
  a young girl struggling for a living&mdash;anything rather than stay in a
  home that was cursed by drink and poverty. I don't remember her, of course.
  She died when I was quite a child, and then it occurred to my father to take
  up his profession. Fortunately, at an early age he had been called to the
  Bar, and from the first he was a great success. You know what he is to-day. I
  know you'd love him&mdash;everybody does."</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;so you've told your father all about me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I have. I told him about you long ago."</p>

  <p>Cecil made no reply for a moment. She had taken one of the orchid blossoms
  from the table and was aimlessly pulling it to pieces.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you taking a good deal for granted?" she challenged.</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps, Cecil; but haven't I had reason to take things for
  granted? Haven't we been together practically every day since June, and
  haven't our friends recognised&mdash; Well, you know what I mean."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's impossible," Cecil said. "I mean&mdash;well, I mean that I'm a
  bit frightened. Oh, I am to blame, if you like. I have encouraged you, I have
  been fickle and shallow, incapable of understanding my own mind. If you like
  to ask me under these conditions&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Chamberlayne rose slowly from the table. There was a certain grimness
  about his mouth and a little hardness in his eyes that set Cecil
  fluttering.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we had better be moving," he said curtly. "And thanks for the
  confession. We'll forget all about it now, but I will come and see you in the
  morning."</p>

  <p>"Is that a threat?" Cecil laughed.</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't&mdash;it's a promise."</p>

  <p>The frown had gone from his face, and as they drove along in the taxi he
  might have been no more than the average polished Society young man doing his
  best to be agreeable to a pretty and fascinating girl. And, strange to say,
  it was this very change&mdash; the change that Cecil had hoped for&mdash;that
  filled her with all sorts of vague alarms. For Cecil knew her world, and
  Chamberlayne was not the first man who had made love to her. She had come,
  like so many brilliant and attractive girls, to regard homage from the
  opposite sex as her prescriptive right. and the sensation that she was merely
  a mouse, within reach of the claws of the cat, frightened whilst at the same
  time it strangely attracted her.</p>

  <p>She was glad enough to find herself in the theatre, waiting for the
  curtain to go up. She glanced round the stalls and returned the nods and
  smiles of her many acquaintances. It was a full house, as she had expected,
  crammed from floor to ceiling, and everybody was there that was worth
  counting at all.</p>

  <p>And then for the next hour or two Cecil forgot all about her anxieties and
  worries in the contemplation of the stage and the triumph of Helen Harcourt
  in one of the finest interpretations that she had ever given in her long and
  distinguished career. It was not that the play was anything amazing in
  itself&mdash;in fact, it was rather commonplace&mdash;but the soul of the
  artiste dominated it all, and the curtain fell finally on a veritable
  triumph.</p>

  <p>Cecil drew a long breath of sheer delight. She had almost forgotten by
  this time that Chamberlayne was seated by her side. She turned to him
  presently with glowing eyes.</p>

  <p>"Wasn't it marvellous?" she said.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," said Alan. "I am horribly out of date, but this sort of
  thing doesn't appeal to me much. I never can quite understand why people make
  so much fuss of actors and actresses. After all, they are only children of
  larger growth playing at make-believe, and they don't create the character.
  The author of the play does that."</p>

  <p>Cecil rose impatiently and made her way in silence into the vestibule. She
  hardly spoke as the taxi purred its way along the streets in the direction of
  Lowndes Gardens. It was much the same when the flat was reached, and even
  Chamberlayne gave a sigh of relief when his hostess arrived and supper was
  announced.</p>

  <p>Helen Harcourt came in a beautiful costume in which she had appeared
  during the last act, tall and graceful, and full of those magnetic qualities
  which made her what she was. She was radiant enough, gracious and friendly as
  usual, but never, in Chamberlayne's eyes, had she appeared more remote and
  aloof than she did at that moment. She was brilliantly witty, as usual, hard
  as a diamond and as dazzling, but this only deepened the impression in
  Chamberlayne's mind.</p>

  <p>And so the meal went on to the conclusion. One o'clock struck somewhere,
  and at length Chamberlayne rose to go. He barely touched Cecil's fingers as
  he said "Good night" to her, and muttered something to the effect that he had
  work to do, and that he hoped to call on her in the morning. The last words
  were so cold that Helen Harcourt elevated her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Good night, Alan," she said, with one of those rare smiles of hers that
  she always kept for him. "Good night, my dear boy. One moment&mdash;your tie
  is a little on one side. Let me put it straight for you. There!"</p>

  <p>She rested her hands on his shoulders just for a moment, then, when she
  had finished her work, allowed her fingers to stray on his sleek hair and
  dropped a careless kiss upon his forehead. It was characteristic of a woman
  of her temperament, a woman who cares nothing for convention, but there was
  just a touch of intimacy in the action that roused some vague symptom of
  jealousy in Cecil's breast. Then Helen Harcourt flung herself back in a chair
  and lighted a cigarette.</p>

    <img src="1301061h-images/TheLonelyFurrow.jpg"
         title="She rested her hands on his shoulders just for a moment.">
  </div><br>

  <p>"This has been a great night for you," Cecil said&mdash;"I should say the
  greatest in your career. I believe, if I were you, I should die happy."</p>

  <p>"Would you?" Mrs. Harcourt sighed. "Ah, I am not at all happy this
  evening; on the contrary, I never felt more miserable."</p>

  <p>"But why?" Cecil cried.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what I mean? No, I am afraid you don't, Cecil. So we had
  better go back to first causes. Why have you quarrelled with Alan?"</p>

  <p>The girl fairly staggered back before the directness of the attack. She
  had no time to fence or dodge, no time to summon up those little, lethal
  sophistries by which women deceive one another. The blood mounted to her
  cheeks, and her eyes grew dim. Then she was herself again.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand what you mean," she said coldly. "I have not
  quarrelled with Alan."</p>

  <p>"No? But you are keeping something from me now. You know what my ambition
  has been for you&mdash;you know that I wanted to see you happily married to
  the finest man I know. And now something has come between you. Won't you tell
  me what it is?"</p>

  <p>"You are imagining these things," Cecil said. "I like Alan Chamberlayne
  immensely. I am sure that he is all you say he is, and more. But I don't want
  to marry him, dearest, and, above all, I want to go on the stage."'</p>

  <p>Mrs. Harcourt sighed gently.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid of that," she said. "My dear girl, I have had scores of
  young women to stay with me from time to time, and, after they have once seen
  me play, every one of them has wanted to go on the stage. Do you know what I
  earned for the first three years of my career?"</p>

  <p>"What does that matter?" Cecil said petulantly.</p>

  <p>"My dear, it matters a great deal. If fame and fortune are to do you, any
  good, they must come in the early thirties&mdash;after that it's too late.
  Ah, I know, and that is why I am so bitterly disappointed to think that you
  should have turned your back on your own happiness so deliberately as you
  have done. Fate gave me the same chance, and I also turned my back upon it.
  Shall I tell you the story?"</p>

  <p>Cecil nodded. She was strangely moved by the torrent of bitter words that
  had fallen from her companion's lips, words that seemed to have a new shape
  and meaning, declaimed as they were by one who knew the utmost value of every
  syllable. And the great actress was playing now with a force and intensify
  that she probably had never displayed before, for she was playing, not to an
  audience, but to the soul of one girl, playing for the stake of human
  happiness.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said. "I'll tell you. But first give me another
  cigarette. I suppose it is the proper thing for the adventurous heroine to
  tell her story with a cigarette between her lips. At least, that is what the
  public expect, and you are my public for the moment, Cecil. I married a good
  man, who took me from a sordid home, and I, like the fool that I was, thought
  I was conferring a favour upon him. From the very first he spoilt me.
  Everything I wanted in reason I could have, though I knew he was saving all
  his income for a specific purpose, and when occasionally he remonstrated with
  me on my extravagance, I only grew angry and accused him of being mean. Mean!
  Good Heavens! Now I know he was one of the most generous men on this earth.
  And so it went on for two years&mdash; two long, dragging years&mdash;during
  which my husband grew poorer and more anxious, and then I left him."</p>

  <p>"You mean you quarrelled?" Cecil asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, there was no quarrel. I have not even that excuse. I had made up
  my mind that he was a poor creature, absolutely unworthy of being the
  soul-mate of so brilliant a personage as myself, and so I left him.</p>

  <p>"I must have cut him to the heart. can see his face now as I told him
  everything. It was to be an absolute parting. It was understood that we were
  never to meet again, and we never have. But I know where my husband is, and
  what he is doing, and I know now what has ever been a bitter humiliation to
  me. I know it was I who kept him down, who spent his money, and crippled him
  in a thousand ways. For the man I regarded as a poor, spiritless creature is
  to-day one of the most successful men in England. Directly he was free from
  me and the weight that I hung about his neck, he began to rise, and he has
  never looked back since. I am not going to try and coerce you&mdash;I won't
  attempt to influence you further. I merely wish to point out what a lonely,
  unsatisfactory life my own selfishness has built up for me; I want to save
  you from the same melancholy fate, if possible. With my eyes wide open I made
  the same mistake as you are going to make. With my eyes wide open I turned my
  back upon my husband and my child&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A child!" Cecil gasped. "How could you?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, how could I? My dear, I have asked myself that same question many
  times. And I am glad to hear you speak like that, because it has proved to me
  that my story has not fallen on barren soil. Yes, it was part of the price I
  had to pay. It was my own suggestion. And now, when the shadows are beginning
  to deepen, and my hair is getting grey, I am alone in the world!"</p>

  <p>"But you might go back," Cecil whispered.</p>

  <p>"I shall never do that," Mrs. Harcourt said sadly. "It would not be fair
  to either of them; I doubt if it would be even fair to me. Why should I
  obtrude upon their lives after all these years? They are well and happy, they
  are devoted to one another, and there was no shadow on my husband's face when
  I saw him last, like there used to be in the old days, when I was dragging
  him down. No, he and the boy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your son!" Cecil exclaimed. "How strange it seems!"</p>

  <p>"My son&mdash;yes. And, mind, this is a secret between us, which you are
  to keep till I give you leave to speak. And do you know why I tell you this?
  Because you love Alan Chamberlayne, you admire his many fine qualities, and
  you are afraid he may dominate you if you marry him. Of course he will; no
  husband is worth his salt who doesn't. And now I have finished. Do you want
  me to tell you any more? Do you want me to tell you why I like Alan so
  well?"</p>

  <p>A great light suddenly leapt into Cecil's eyes, the lines about her lips
  trembled and wavered. Then, with a smile, she got up and reached for the
  telephone on the table. As she called the number of Chamberlayne's flat
  clearly and firmly, Helen Harcourt smiled, too, and there were tears standing
  in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Complete surrender?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely!" Cecil laughed unsteadily. "Absolutely! Listen..."</p><br>

  <h2><a id="story9"
     name="story9">9.&mdash;A CALL ON THE PHONE</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Queenslander</i>, Brisbane, Australia, 22 Dec
  1917</h3>

  <p class="first">ALL day long the stuffy little court house had been crowded
  with perspiring humanity eager to hear every word of the proceedings against
  Edgar Warner. True, up to then it was only a preliminary inquiry, but every
  man there felt that Warner was being tried for his life. Hour after hour the
  inquest dragged on till the dusk of the summer evening faded into night.
  Still the listeners sat patiently on, heedless of the flight of time. They
  were waiting for Warner to give his evidence, as he had expressed the
  intention of doing. The coroner had another engagement on the morrow, so that
  he was prepared to sit till midnight if necessary.</p>

  <p>The facts were fairly simple. Mr. William Tuson had been found dead in his
  library. Obviously, he had come to a violent end. A blow on the head from
  some blunt, heavy instrument had fractured his skull, and, according to the
  medical evidence, he had died instantly. Tuson was by way of being a money
  lender, and he had a reputation for hardness and sharp practice in Langford.
  Warner was a musician and a song writer, and it was generally known that he
  had some grievance against Tuson over some business matters in which Warner
  roundly declared that he had been swindled. There had been a violent quarrel
  and subsequent litigation, followed by a threat on Tuson's part of making
  Warner a bankrupt. Certainly Warner was in the moneylender's debt&mdash;he
  had failed to meet an acceptance as it became due, and the acceptance, torn
  in two pieces, had been found in Warner's garden behind some bushes, the
  suggestion being that Warner had stolen the paper after he had made away with
  his creditor.</p>

  <p>He denied stoutly that he had seen Tuson on the night of the tragedy.
  Tuson was known to have been alive and well at 11 o'clock in the evening in
  question, the insinuation being that Warner had called upon him after that
  hour, when everybody was in bed. Warner stoutly maintained that after supper
  he had not left his house. He was in the habit of staying up very late
  composing and playing, his wife and the one maidservant, on the contrary,
  always retiring early. In consequence of his very late hours, Warner had his
  own bedroom, so that he could sleep when he pleased. On the night of the
  tragedy he had been writing from 9 o'clock till half-past 1, when he retired.
  He declared that he had never been outside the house. But he had no means of
  verifying this statement. It would have been the easiest matter for him to
  have been away any length of time without the members of his household being
  any the wiser. It was on this evidence that Langford had come to the
  conclusion that Edgar Warner was guilty of the death of William Tuson. He had
  killed the man in order to obtain possession of that acceptance and thus
  destroy all evidence that he was in debt to the moneylender.</p>

  <p>But there was one more witness to come. It was getting very late when a
  slim little woman in spectacles stepped up to the tables to give her
  evidence. Her name was Maud Matty, and her occupation telephone operator at
  the Langford exchange. She remembered the night of the murder quite
  well&mdash;on that evening she had been on duty in the exchange. About
  half-past 11 she had had a call from No. 110, who gave the number 166 as the
  one needed.</p>

  <p>"What does this refer to?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"No. 110 is Mr. Warner's number, sir," Inspector Hames explained. "No. 166
  is the number of Mr. Tuson's telephone. We regard this evidence as being of
  great importance."</p>

  <p>The tired, perspiring audience thrilled. Most of them knew exactly what
  this meant. On the night of the murder at half-past 11 Warner had called up
  the dead man&mdash;the man subsequently found dead.</p>

  <p>"Really!" the coroner exclaimed. "Are you quite sure of this, Miss
  Matty?"</p>

  <p>"Quite certain, sir," the witness said quietly. "I took the call myself. I
  heard a question asked."</p>

  <p>"You listened?" Warner put in eagerly. "You listened to what was
  passing?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly that. But I could hear. You called up Mr. Tuson and gave your
  name. You asked Mr. Tuson if you could see him at once for a few moments, and
  he gave you a reply to the effect that it was very late, but if you came at
  once he would see you."</p>

  <p>The audience swayed with excitement. This was a dramatic surprise that
  they had not expected. Warner stood up deadly pale and defiant, his angry
  eyes challenged the witness. But she stood there coolly and collectedly, and
  evidently quite sure of her ground.</p>

  <p>"I am prepared to swear that I never used the telephone all the evening,"
  Warner cried.</p>

  <p>"You will be good enough to be quiet," the coroner said. "The witness must
  not be interrupted. Now, Miss Matty, is there any possible proof of
  this?"</p>

  <p>"I recognised Mr. Warner's voice," the operator proceeded. "In a small
  exchange like ours we get to know the voices of our subscribers quite well.
  Mr. Warner has a slot machine and he cannot call without putting in a penny.
  The call and the pennies are recorded automatically. There were five calls
  that day altogether, and if necessary, sir, you can come and see for
  yourself. The instrument cannot make a mistake."</p>

  <p>Warner had no question to ask. He was utterly taken by surprise at the
  dramatic evidence; he could see how terribly it told against him. And here
  was some deadly mechanical contrivance that could not possibly be gainsaid.
  He could feel the rope about his neck.</p>

  <p>"May I say a few words?" he asked when the witness had disappeared. "May I
  give evidence now?"</p>

  <p>"I should strongly advise you not to," the Coroner said significantly. "If
  you will be advised by me, you will be legally represented at the next
  hearing. Have you any more witnesses, Inspector?"</p>

  <p>"Not to-night, sir," Hames said. "I propose, with your permission, to take
  an adjournment at this point. Since the last witness came and volunteered her
  evidence yesterday, I have been making inquiries. I think it would be in the
  interests of the inquiry, and possibly in the interest of Mr. Warner also, if
  I asked him a few questions. I should like to know if he is right or left
  handed."</p>

  <p>A general smile followed this apparently inconsequent query. But Hames was
  perfectly grave. The more astute amongst the spectators began to scent
  further dramatic complication here.</p>

  <p>"I am right-handed," the puzzled Warner said. "I will write a few words if
  you like. And Inspector Hames knows that I am a right-handed cricketer and
  fisherman."</p>

  <p>"I had forgotten that," Hames smiled. Warner was a local celebrity as a
  cricketer. "Now will you tell me if you happen to be deaf in the left
  ear?"</p>

  <p>Once more a puzzled murmur ran round the room. Warner shook his head
  vigorously. He was not deaf in either ear, and he was prepared to undergo any
  fair test to prove it. With the right ear closed, Warner could follow a
  whispered conversation some fifteen feet away. Hames smiled with the air of a
  man who is perfectly satisfied with the condition of things.</p>

  <p>"That is more than sufficient for my purpose," he said. "I shall be
  obliged sir, if you will order an adjournment of the case till Monday morning
  at 10 o'clock."</p>

  <p>It was most exasperating for the audience, of course. They were turned out
  just in the moment when the case had assumed its most exciting form. And what
  did Hames mean by asking those extraordinary questions? They could not
  possibly have anything to do with the inquiry. As they filed out into the
  coolness of the night they morally condemned Edgar Warner to death. The
  coroner beckoned Hames to his side as he packed up his papers.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you have worked all this out?" he said. "Still, after the
  evidence offered to-night, I was rather surprised that you did not apply for
  a warrant. On the girl's testimony, I should certainly have granted one."</p>

  <p>"Then you regard Warner as guilty of the crime, sir?" Hames asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I do. The evidence is absolutely overwhelming. It is all on
  record, too."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I admit that," said Hames thoughtfully. "Now I am bound to confess
  that until Miss Matty came to me, and volunteered her evidence, I regarded
  Warner as guilty. Everything pointed that way. The finding of that torn
  acceptance was almost conclusive. It was after Miss Matty had told her story
  that I came to the conclusion that Warner had nothing whatever to do with
  it."</p>

  <p>The coroner shrugged his shoulders. He could not follow the logic of it at
  all. It was strange to him that the most damning piece of evidence on the
  part of the prisoner should be construed into one of the main planks of the
  defence. Hames was a very smart officer and worthy of a better place, but he
  was carrying his modern methods and ingenious deductions too far.</p>

  <p>Hames hurried along and caught up Warner as the latter was turning into
  his gate. The house was close on the roadside, with the hall window flush
  with the road. To keep out prying eyes, stained glass of sorts had been put
  in the window, but when the hall gas was fully on a dim outline of the
  interior could be seen. It was possible to make out the stair carpet and
  certain objects in the broad window ledge. One of the most conspicuous
  objects there was the telephone that had caused all the trouble.</p>

  <p>"May I come in for a few minutes?" Hames asked.</p>

  <p>"If you like," Warner replied, none too graciously. "There is nobody in
  the house. Directly people began to talk&mdash;as they did almost before the
  breath was out of Tuson's body&mdash;I sent my wife to her mother and the
  maid to her home. I have been doing for myself ever since. I suppose you
  haven't come for me?"</p>

  <p>"No," Hames said. "On the contrary, I am here to assist you if I can."</p>

  <p>Warner turned into his study. His hands trembled as he lit the gas.</p>

  <p>"I am an innocent man," he cried passionately. "I swear to you in the
  presence of my Maker that I was not out of the house on the night of the
  murder. It would be an easy thing, quite the prudent thing, to admit having
  sent that telephone message and to declare that I changed my mind after. All
  this flashed across me in court to-night, and I could have done it easily.
  But I never sent that message. If this is to be my last word on earth, I
  never sent it, Hames."</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, I am perfectly well aware of that," Hames said quietly.</p>

  <p>Warner gazed at the speaker, as if doubting his meaning.</p>

  <p>"You are one of the very few who regard me as not guilty?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am certain of it," Hames said. "Mind you, I thought so at one time. I
  thought so until, curiously enough, the most damning evidence of all was
  tendered against you. Then I began to ask questions. I was about your house
  last night for an hour or more. I saw something, a little thing, that gave me
  an idea. That is why I asked you those questions to-night. If you had been
  deaf in your left ear I should have regarded you as guilty. As it is, I know
  that you are quite innocent."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I give it up," Warner cried impatiently. "The thing is too wildly
  farcical for me. What on earth has my normal faculty of hearing got to do
  with it?"</p>

  <p>Hames passed the question. All that would come quite plain in due course,
  he said. Meanwhile he wanted to know if Warner had used his telephone
  lately?</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I haven't," Warner explained. "It hasn't been used
  since the night of the murder&mdash;and not by me then, despite what
  the&mdash;girl from the exchange said. We had no occasion to call anybody,
  and by 11 o'clock in the day after the murder, my wife and my servant had
  left the house. I have not spoken to anybody over the line since. I am a poor
  man, as you know, and I look at a penny twice before I put it in the slot. It
  would have been different if that blackguard Tuson had not robbed me. I have
  discharged that bill that was picked up over and over again by music that I
  gave to Tuson for a song. He detained an opera of mine to which he was not in
  the least entitled. That rascal was the ruin of me. But that has nothing to
  do with it whatever. Why are you so anxious to know all about the
  telephone?"</p>

  <p>Hames led the way out into the hall. The telephone stood in an angle on
  the broad window-ledge with the latticed panes behind it. The receiver hung
  over on the right hook.</p>

  <p>"Now look at that," Hames said, as he pointed at the fact. "Why does the
  receiver hang on the right-hand hook? It should hang on the left. If you were
  left-handed it would hang that way, of course&mdash;in fact, it would be
  impossible to replace it in any other way. The obvious way is to ring with
  the right hand and put the receiver to the left ear. If you are deaf in the
  left ear you would reverse the receiver. Now, you are not deaf in the left
  ear and yet the receiver is reversed. I noticed this as I was prowling about
  the house last night&mdash;you can see the instrument quite plainly when your
  hall gas is lit. Now, you may say that this is a ridiculous detail. As a
  matter of fact, it is very important&mdash;for you. Miss Matty's evidence,
  which is going to hang you in the opinion of Langford, is going to save you
  in mine. What a remarkably lucky thing it is that you are not deaf in the
  left ear!"</p>

  <p>And more than that Hames refused to say. For the present he was going
  entirely on theory, and even the most ingenious theories are apt to be
  misleading.</p>

  <p>"Of your innocence I am assured," he said. "I am going to prove it before
  long, but I must do this thing in my own time and in my own way. I have a lot
  still to do to-night, but before I go let me give you one word of advice.
  Don't touch your telephone. On no account send a message."</p>

  <p>Warner gave the desired assurance, and Hames went his way. For the next
  hour or so he remained closeted with his detective staff. Being on the
  outskirts of a large seaport, Langford contained a floating population of
  undesirables in the lodging-houses and in the public houses, and it was as to
  the doings of these that Hames was interested. He wanted to know if any of
  them had been flash of money lately. It was in the course of the next morning
  that Hames sifted a mass of information on this point and began to see his
  way to act. He took the train as far as Sandmouth, and presently entered the
  office of the telephone company and asked to see the manager.</p>

  <p>"I'm Inspector Hames from Langford," he said. "I will take it for granted
  that you know something as to the mysterious murder of Mr. Tuson, sir? Or
  shall I explain?"</p>

  <p>"No occasion at all," the manager said. "I read all the evidence. As the
  case turns upon a telephone call, I was naturally interested. You'll find
  that they won't shake the evidence of our operator yonder."</p>

  <p>"I shall be greatly disappointed if they do," Hames said gravely. "I know
  that that particular call went through. But it doesn't in the least follow
  that it was sent by Warner personally."</p>

  <p>"Then who else would have sent it? The thing couldn't have been done
  without Warner's knowledge. He was in the house all the evening, according to
  his statement. It is a small house, too."</p>

  <p>"A small house with the study within a few feet of the hall," Hames
  agreed. "I have a pretty sound theory of what really did happen, but I want
  to test it, of course. Now, the house next to Warner's is empty. Could you
  rig me up a temporary instrument there and connect it with Warner's house in
  such a way that I should get the call if anybody used Warner's telephone.
  Suppose he gave a call himself. I want your operator at the exchange to see
  that I get the message whoever it is sent to. And I want to be in a position
  to know if anybody uses Warner's instrument. Can you do that?"</p>

  <p>The manager nodded thoughtfully. That would not be at all a difficult
  matter, he explained. If anybody in Warner's house called the exchange, the
  extension, to the next house would enable a listener to hear all that was
  going on. To switch the caller in Warner's house on to the temporary
  instrument next door was merely a matter of drilling the operator at the
  exchange. The manager promised that the business should have his immediate
  and careful attention. The necessary work should be done in the course of the
  day. It was getting dark when Hames finished some work at his office, after
  which he proceeded to write out a telegram as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="telegram">PILMER, 17, HARROW-TERRACE. TROUBLE OVER OLD MATTER.
  CAN'T SHOW UP JUST YET. MATTER BLOW OVER PROBABLY. GIVE ME CALL TELEPHONE
  1753 ABOUT 11 O'CLOCK TO-NIGHT. SAME OLD GAME. HOUSE EMPTY.</p>

  <p>Hames consigned the message to one of his subordinates with certain
  definite instructions.</p>

  <p>"Send the message off," he said. "And hang about near Harrow-terrace till
  the thing is delivered. As soon as that is done take two or three men down to
  17, Dock Row; and arrest the man and his wife that you find there. See that
  this is done secretly and that nobody spots what you are doing. It is
  imperative that there shall be no fuss or curiosity aroused. That's about
  all, I think."</p>

  <p>The telegram was despatched and delivered, and the arrests subsequently
  made to Hames's entire satisfaction. With a feeling in his mind that
  everything was going smoothly, he returned about 11 o'clock to the empty
  house next to the one occupied by Warner. He let himself quietly in by the
  door, and located the temporary instrument that had been placed there by the
  obliging manager of the telephone company. With the absolute assurance that
  he would get an important message presently, he sat down and waited. Within a
  few minutes after the hour the little bell rippled out.</p>

  <p>"Your number 1753?" a husky voice asked.</p>

  <p>"That's right. That you, Charlie? What's' up, old man? Your telegram gave
  me a rare fright."</p>

  <p>"We're being watched," Hames responded in the same muffled tone. "Eh? Yes,
  I've got the very deuce of a cold tonight. You calling me from the old spot,
  I suppose? That's good! The cops have found out that the old man had a lot of
  brass in his desk, and it's missing. Don't you get splashing it about for a
  day or two. I'm lying low in Sandmouth for a little while keeping my eyes
  open. Can't stay any longer now, old man. Give me a call same way same time
  to-morrow night. So long."</p>

  <p>At eleven o'clock the following night Hames was seated in Warner's study.
  The house was supposed to be empty, but as a matter of fact Warner had not
  left it. There were no lights anywhere. As the clock in the hall struck the
  hour of eleven Hames moved from the study into the hall, followed by Warner.
  Hames took up his place close to the telephone and waited. A few minutes
  later the window was opened from the outside very gently and quietly, and a
  hand fumbled for the bell-handle. Hames pounced upon it like lightning, and
  held it in a grip like a vice. A volley of curses broke out of the darkness,
  there was a sound as of violently scuffling feet. Lanterns flashed about
  outside.</p>

  <p>"Put up the gas," Hames shouted. "The fellow is safe in the hands of my
  men outside. Bring him in, Parker. Ah, I think your name is Pilmer, late of
  Harrow-terrace. Well, my man, you are arrested on the charge of murdering Mr.
  Tuson and with subsequently robbing him of £143/4/9. You need not say
  anything unless you like, but your friend Charlie is in custody, and so is
  his wife. Rather foolish for poor Charlie to buy his wife a diamond ring in
  Langford, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>The discomfited ruffian cursed aloud, but Hames waved him aside. "Take him
  away," he said. "I'll follow presently. I want a few words with Mr. Warner
  first."</p>

  <p>"How on earth did you manage it all?" Warner asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, you see," Hames explained. "It was all that transfer of the
  telephone receiver from the right to the left-hand hook. The thing first
  struck me as untidy. I noticed it as I was prowling about your house. The
  telephone is so plain from the road when the gas is lit. Then it suddenly
  struck me that anybody could use that phone from outside by opening the old
  catch on the window. And anybody using it from the outside, unless they were
  left-handed, would have to turn the handle with the left hand, and hold the
  receiver with the right. As they were working the telephone from the wrong
  side, so to speak, there was no other way. And that's how the receiver came
  to be hanging on the wrong hook. Mind you, the thing is quite easily done by
  standing well back from the window with the flex at full stretch; in that
  case you would hear nothing. The penny was dropped in the slot quietly, and
  there you are. Those ruffians had planned what to do&mdash;they would easily
  know that you were at daggers drawn with Tuson, and that's why they called up
  on your phone imitating your voice. By that means they learnt everything they
  wanted to know. They killed the old man and robbed him; they found that bill
  of yours and left it where it would be detected and used as evidence against
  you. It did not take long to fix on the guilty parties, especially when I
  found two suspects who were spending money freely. I arrested one lot and
  tricked the other to come to the telephone to speak to me. He thought that he
  was talking to his pal, but he was merely talking to me from your house to
  next door, per the exchange. I got him to try on the same game to-night, so
  that I could catch him red-handed. He tumbled into the trap, and he has
  enabled me to prove my case up to the hilt. If I were you, in future I would
  not keep my telephone in so tempting and conspicuous a place."</p>

  <p>Warner hung on to Hames's hand almost affectionately.</p>

  <p>"I can't thank you," he said. "But all the same I am going to take your
  advice."</p><br>

     name="story10">10.&mdash;A DRAUGHT OF LIFE</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY FRANK GILLETT</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XLVII, Feb 1918, pp
  319-324</h3>

  <p class="first">NOW, every man has a story to tell once in his life, though,
  as a rule, it is the one thing he is shy of talking about, and therefore the
  world is all the poorer by a certain amount of decorative fiction. Sometimes
  this story is a sort of solo, and sometimes forms part of an orchestra, so to
  speak; but in this particular instance it was a duet or a duologue, according
  to the point of view of the critic.</p>

  <p>Ned Buckley and Patrick Macardie were great friends. They had been at
  school together; they were fond of the same sort of literature, beginning
  with Fenimore Cooper, and grading, by delicate stages, up to
  Stevenson&mdash;in other words, two healthy-minded public-school boys with a
  decided taste for adventure. And so it came about naturally enough that,
  before they settled down in life, this love of adventure had to be gratified;
  and it was gratified, as this veracious narrative will show.</p>

  <p>They are getting on in life now&mdash;in the early forties, as a matter of
  fact&mdash;a little inclined to added girth, a little prone to ease in the
  evenings, and taking no more risks to-day than an occasional half-crown
  wagered on a golf match&mdash;that is, respectable citizens with a
  substantial stake in the country, men leading honest lives more or less
  luxuriously in the bosoms of rising, families, and taking a languid interest
  in current topics of the day. They wear top hats most of the week, Harris
  tweeds on a Saturday, and they are rather inclined to somnolence on Sunday
  afternoons; and though they are very great friends indeed, having business
  habits in common, one or two sharp observers have noticed that they do not
  particularly care to be alone together, unless they happen to have a golf
  club or a gun in their hands. And this is the cause of it.</p>

  <p>About fifteen years ago, by sheer good luck, or so it seemed, Buckley and
  Macardie dropped on to what looked like a good thing. Now, a "good thing" in
  the English vernacular, means anything from a racing tip to the discovery of
  a hidden gold mine. And it was this last item that they seemed to have
  stumbled on.</p>

  <p>It matters little or nothing how it came their way; it matters little or
  nothing how the plans fell into their hands; nor do difficulties and dangers
  appeal much to men well on the sunny side of thirty. At that time they were
  looking for something to do, something outside the ordinary City routine, and
  when, one summer holiday in Paris, they came upon a ragged and tough
  individual, who sold them certain information in return for the few francs
  which were necessary to purchase sufficient absinthe permanently to terminate
  a picturesque career, they did not stop to go into details, but decided to
  proceed to the southern extremity of the Red Sea at once.</p>

  <p>They had health and strength, and love of adventure, and sufficient means
  to carry the thing through to a finish, which, indeed, might mean their
  extermination, but they were not troubling much about that. So therefore they
  found themselves, a few weeks later, skirting inland along the borders of
  Abyssinia, in search of their goal. And, for once in a way, they found it. It
  was indeed "all right." Not only was it "all right," but they had it entirely
  to themselves&mdash;they and about a score of carriers who had been impressed
  into the service. It was a lonely and desolate spot, three hundred miles from
  the coast, in a fair enough country, wonderfully wooded and sufficiently
  watered, which was rather an important matter in a torrid climate that was
  not very far removed from the arid and sandy desert. By the time their work
  was done, the provisions were running short, and signs were not wanting of a
  spirit of insubordination amongst the natives.</p>

  <p>Buckley was a little hot-headed and impulsive, and he had a way of his own
  with the natives which those simple children of Nature were disposed to
  resent. They resented these methods still more when one evening they broke
  into the stores and abstracted a couple of bottles of whisky, with which they
  proceeded to drink themselves into a state of temporary madness. Then there
  were alarums and excursions, accompanied by a fusillade of revolver shots,
  resulting in the death of one or two of the natives, and the precipitate
  flight of the rest. Indeed, they fled so far that they never came back again,
  so that the two Englishmen were left entirely alone, nearly three hundred
  miles from their base, with an unreliable compass, and the very faintest idea
  as to where they were.</p>

  <p>They had taken no particular precautions to mark their route, leaving that
  entirely to their native servants. They had a certain amount of provisions,
  and therefore a day or two elapsed before the peril of the situation began to
  dawn upon them.</p>

  <p>They were scores of miles from the nearest human being, on the edge of a
  sandy desert, and with barely sufficient food to bring them down to the coast
  again. They had located their mine all right, and in ordinary conditions
  would have been mightily pleased with themselves, had not starvation at the
  end of a few days stared them in the face.</p>

  <p>"Well, my boy, we're up against it, sure," Macardie remarked. "It'll be a
  big thing to get back to the fork of the river, but it's got to be done."</p>

  <p>Buckley nodded gloomily. He was feeling none the more amiable because the
  whole catastrophe was entirely his own fault.</p>

  <p>"How many days to get there?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, four at the least," Macardie said. "And then we haven't finished.
  We could manage then, in a way, because the canoes are there, and there are
  plenty of fish in the river. But there's another thing that's worrying
  me."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Buckley asked.</p>

  <p>"Water, my boy, water. We haven't got enough to last more than another
  day, and, so far as I remember, we are two long marches from the nearest
  water-hole. Oh, it doesn't sound much, but that's going to be our
  trouble."</p>

  <p>Macardie spoke cheerfully enough, but his heart was sore and heavy within
  him. They tramped on most of the afternoon under a torrid sky, dragging their
  provisions with them as best they could, till they came at length to a rocky
  spur in the foothills, where they pitched camp on the edge of a dense forest.
  They could see that here and there the trees had been torn away by tropical
  storms of wind and rain, and underfoot in the sheltered hollows the dead
  leaves lay knee-deep. Here and there was a flat plateau of living rock, where
  the foliage lay as level as it would have done on a billiard table. And away
  in the distance somewhere&mdash;though how far away they could not
  say&mdash;was the continuous sullen roar that could have come from nothing
  but a great waterfall. But it was a long way off indeed&mdash;they had heard
  it now for an hour or two in an increasing volume of sound, and, so far as
  they knew, a couple of days might have been between them and that mighty
  stream which represented to them almost more than life itself.</p>

  <p>"We have got to find that," Buckley said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, we've got to find it right enough," his companion replied, "and I
  guess we're going the right way. It might be a week off yet, and if it
  is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then we are done," Buckley remarked. The situation was beginning to get a
  grip upon him. He had more imagination than his mercurial companion, and he
  was. thinking just then of the precious pint or two of water that remained in
  the last of the skins. They sat down presently and made their camp for the
  night. They rose in the morning under a brazen sky, with a torturing sun
  blazing overhead, so that they were glad enough to remain there till late in
  the afternoon, when they pushed forward in what appeared to be the direction
  whence that volume of sound came. And when they settled down for the second
  night, still on that plateau of rock, with a flat valley between the rising
  banks, they divided a small cup of water between them, and sat down to the
  pretence of a meal.</p>

  <p>They were fully alive to the danger now; they had gone mile after mile in
  almost sullen silence, glancing uneasily at one another, and both a little
  inclined to be quarrelsome. Their lips were getting dry and cracked, their
  tongues were swelling in their mouths, and tobacco had become a mere mockery.
  They would have to finish their water in the morning, and then&mdash; Well,
  they did not care to think of that. They did not care to think of the gold
  mine and all the dazzling prospects that it held out. They would have sold it
  cheerfully at that moment, and have held it well marketed, for a glass of the
  cold water that was so near and yet so far away.</p>

  <p>And in the morning they finished their last precious drops of liquid, and
  turned their blackened and weary faces in the direction of the distant
  waterfall. It was getting nearer now&mdash;near enough to encourage them and
  put new life into those tired limbs of theirs&mdash;but then they had heard
  it for days now, and every hour was of vital importance. All that day not one
  word had passed between them as they plodded doggedly along. To eat was
  impossible. They laid out their food, looking at it languidly, and turning
  away from it with a sort of horror. The more mercurial Macardie had made a
  bold attempt to swallow a piece of biscuit, but the effort almost choked him,
  and he spat it out again. Buckley watched him with a curious sense of
  irritability that amounted to positive dislike. Then they exchanged a glance
  that was almost murderous.</p>

  <p>They were very near the border-line. It wanted nothing but one word spoken
  at that moment to set them flying at one another's throats; but then speech
  was almost as impossible as food. And all the time in their ears was the
  maddening, luring roar of that waterfall. They could picture it near at hand,
  falling into the cool stone basin below; they could see themselves sunk to
  the mouth in it, cooling their parched throats with long, delicious draughts,
  and laving their weary bodies in it. It was torture, refined and exquisite,
  torture that was wearing on their fevered brains and driving them to
  madness.</p>

  <p>They pulled up presently, dead beat to the world, on the ridge of rocks,
  and flung themselves down under the shelter of one of the great forest trees.
  Behind them the forest stretched away mile upon mile, and on the other side
  of the valley the sinister woodland was equally thick and forbidding. These
  two fringes of wood were not more than sixty or seventy yards apart, with a
  shelf of rock on either side trending sharply down into the flat valley,
  level as a pavement and feet deep in the leaves which the winter storms and
  gales had reaped from the forest. They lay there on a thick, smooth carpet
  that had something almost maddeningly monotonous about it. A quarter of a
  mile or so further on the ledge of rocks made a bold sweep round, so as to
  form a kind of natural amphitheatre, a lifting shoulder of basaltic rock that
  looked almost sheer in the distance.</p>

  <p>Buckley passed a black tongue over his dry lips.</p>

  <p>"It's over yonder," he whispered; "it's over beyond that ledge of
  rock."</p>

  <p>Macardie regarded the prospect with a lacklustre eye.</p>

  <p>"I dare say," he said listlessly. "I'm done. We are both done. I could
  scream. I don't know why, but I'd like to lay hands on myself&mdash;yes, or
  on you, for the matter of that. Just listen to it!"</p>

  <p>Buckley clapped his hands over his ears&mdash;anything to shut out the
  siren call of those falling waters. They were calling close at hand now, but
  to all practical purposes that life-giving stream might have been a thousand
  miles away.</p>

  <p>And they were utterly beaten. Flesh and blood could stand it no longer,
  and for all the water in the world they could not have gone another mile. And
  all the time that alluring music was in their ears, mocking them with its
  madness until they both broke into weak, hysterical laughter, and in thin,
  cracked voices began to sing. But their mirth was so horrible and mocking
  that presently they ceased.</p>

  <p>"What's the good?" Buckley whispered. "We've done all men can do. Here,
  get out that bottle of brandy."</p>

  <p>Reckless as he was, Macardie shook his head.</p>

  <p>"What's the good of that?" he whispered. "You can't drink neat brandy,
  man. You'd never swallow it; and, if you could, it would only drive you
  mad."</p>

  <p>"We are both mad now," Buckley said. "I am. Here, stand on one side! I'm
  going to have that brandy, if I kill you for it!"</p>

  <p>Macardie struggled to his feet. So weak was he that he could only stagger
  in the direction of his friend and catch him feebly round the waist. And
  there they struggled together&mdash;if struggle it could be called&mdash;like
  two new-born kittens, like some immature animals in pain. They fought on,
  first one and then the other on top, until they were too exhausted to
  continue the struggle. They lay down side by side, not more than a foot
  apart, glaring insanely into one another's eyes. And then Buckley broke out
  into horrible tears.</p>

  <p>"Give it me!" he implored. "Let me have it! We'll share the bottle between
  us, every drop of it, then we shall go to sleep and wake no more. We've
  disappointed those chaps long enough; they're waiting for us!"</p>

  <p>As Buckley spoke, he pointed with a shaking forefinger to three or four
  great black objects wheeling round slowly and majestically in the brazen sky
  overhead. And there was no reason to tell Macardie what they were. He had
  seen them up there in the zenith for two days past&mdash;seen them in the
  evenings on the branches of the great trees, waiting with a certain dogged
  patience that was perhaps more terrible than any open attack by the great
  vultures would have been. For they knew&mdash;they knew how near the
  inevitable end was, and the beating of their wings was a sort of hideous
  requiem.</p>

  <p>Macardie shook his fist feebly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you devils," he said, "you're waiting for us, are you? Well, you'll
  not have long to wait now. But you'll not have that brandy, Buckley. You've
  got to die like a man, so you can just make the best of it."</p>

  <p>Buckley snivelled like a scolded child. His nerve was utterly gone now; he
  was a mere rag of manhood, and it was not for him to know that his companion
  was in little better case. But he dried his eyes presently, and lay there
  quite still, staring up hopelessly into the brazen sky. And then both of
  them, worn out and exhausted, fell asleep&mdash;an uneasy sleep, full of
  strange, haunting dreams, with no rest behind it, and no cease to that
  hideous torture until the sun rose again.</p>

  <p>They rose simultaneously, gazing at one another with hopeless eyes, like a
  pair of human scarecrows, almost past speech, with lips that were cracked and
  blackened, and swollen tongues protruding through their teeth. They were
  almost too exhausted to move now&mdash;Macardie past motion altogether, so
  that when presently he saw his companion drag himself in the direction of the
  stores, he could do no more than follow him with a gleam of hatred in his
  bloodshot eyes.</p>

  <p>He saw Buckley take the last bottle of the precious brandy from the case
  and withdraw the cork. Then, almost in a spirit of bullying bravado, Buckley
  crept back to his companion's side and held the bottle close to him.</p>

  <p>A queer sort of angry snarl came from Macardie's lips as he shot out a
  hand and grasped the bottle by the neck. He was past feeling or caring now;
  it was all the same to him, only that the gleam of triumph on Buckley's face
  roused him to a sense of passing madness. He did not want the fiery stuff
  himself&mdash;he only wanted to prevent the other man from drinking it. He
  gave one wrench, the bottle came away in his hand, and with a final effort he
  threw it over the ledge of rock, so that it fell down the slope on to the
  flat surface of leaves below, and there it disappeared.</p>

  <p>With a strength born of sudden rage, Buckley rose to his feet and
  disappeared over the edge in search of the bottle. He was too weak to make
  his way down, and so he rolled from top to bottom, until he came, with a
  crash, on the hard flat rock below, with its covering of leaves, where he
  disappeared altogether, vanished out of sight as if those leaves had been no
  more than a crust over some bottomless pit.</p>

         title="Buckley... disappeared in search of the bottle.">
  </div><br>

  <p>A quarter of a minute went by, half a minute, with no sign or sound from
  Buckley, And then, with a feeble glimmer of reason, Macardie dragged himself
  to the edge of the rock and looked down. He could see nothing of his
  companion, nothing but the carpet of leaves, that seemed, before his dim and
  hazy eyes, to ripple in some strange way, as if the whole surface had been
  disturbed by a passing wind. Then came the miracle.</p>

  <p>Out from the middle of the mass of leaves a hand shot up, then another
  one, and followed the upper part of Buckley's body, just as if he were
  standing on a hard floor in a sea of dead leaves that reached far above his
  waist. Then he waded, with his chest pushed forward, towards the uplift of
  the rock, and presently came hand over hand up the slope, shouting and
  singing joyously on his way.</p>

  <p>Just for a moment it seemed to Macardie's dazed vision that here was
  another form of madness. It seemed to him that Buckley's eyes had cleared
  wonderfully, and that his dry and cracked lips had become amazingly moist;
  and Buckley's clothes seemed to cling about him, and moisture was running
  from his shoulders. Oh, madness, beyond all question!</p>

  <p>"Here, wake up!" Buckley cried, in a voice that was strangely strong and
  natural. "I've found it. And it's been there all the time. We've been
  marching side by side with it for two or three days. Come along!"</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Macardie gasped. "You are wet."</p>

  <p>"Of course I am!" Buckley shouted. "It's water down there&mdash;a stream
  of beautiful clear, cold water, but so smothered with leaves that you can't
  see it. What we thought was flat rock was nothing in the world but thick
  leaves floating on the stream. And here were we, trying to cut one another's
  throats, sheer mad for the sake of a drink, and it's all down there, waiting
  for us ! Here, come on!"</p>

  <p>In his new strength Buckley lifted his companion in his arms and staggered
  down the slope again. He plunged Macardie through the sheet of leaves, right
  down in the cool depths below, where he drank his fill and revelled in the
  delicious coolness of it. Then, when the first feeling of ecstasy had passed,
  they climbed up the slope and made a hearty meal; and after that they tasted,
  for the first time for days, the delights of tobacco.</p>

  <p>"It's quite plain," Buckley said. "You see what it is. We struck this
  stream at a right angle, and we naturally took that deep water for a great
  pocket of leaves lying in the valley between the hills. Well, we know all
  about it now, thank Heaven. This river runs under the amphitheatre yonder,
  through natural caverns, and pitches down on the other side of the range into
  the valley beyond. Hence the waterfall we've been listening to for days. Now,
  look here, this is a pretty bit of stream, and it's any odds, if we follow
  over the bluff yonder, we shall find a fertile valley on the other side. And
  where you find fertile valleys and big streams, you are pretty sure to find
  human life as well. That's our game, Mac. The river runs down to the coast,
  of course, and with any luck we'll strike it yet. And we've struck something
  better than that."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Macardie asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, a shorter, simpler, and safer way of reaching our mine, of course.
  Just one more pipe, and then we'll push on. A close call, wasn't it, old
  man?"</p>

  <p>And that is the adventure. And that is also why it is never mentioned
  between Macardie and Buckley, and why they are a little reticent and
  uncomfortable when they are alone together.</p><br>
