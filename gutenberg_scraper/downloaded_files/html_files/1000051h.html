<h2>ABOUT THIS BOOK</h2>

<h3>Readers with an aversion to spoilers may skip this section</h3>

<p class="quote"><i>Knight Without Armour</i> is an intensely
human story of an Englishman whose early Quixotism plunged
him into a series of adventures in which love and tranquility
were found at last, but only after great suffering, and
against the stormy background of war and revolution.</p>

<p class="quote">Compelled by circumstances to conceal his
identity as a British secret agent in prewar Russia, he finds
himself involved as a result in all the tragic consequences
of Russian history from Tsardom to Bolshevism. He is sent to
Siberia, and after the Revolution is released to become and
official of the Soviet. How the chance arrest of an
aristocrat becomes an escape with her through the vast
confusion of Russia in 1919; how this man, chilled by
suffering and hardships, finds his own personal romance
amidst the darkest miseries of famine and civil war&mdash;this
is the thread of adventure running breathlessly through a
 novel which is notable for an extraordinary creation of
atmosphere as well as for tense dramatic interest.</p>

<h2><a id="part1"></a>PART I</h2>

<h2>PROLOGUE</h2>

<p class="first">"THERE died on the 13th inst. at Roone's
Hotel, Carrigole, Co. Cork, where he had been staying
for some time, Mr. Ainsley Jergwin Fothergill, in his
forty-ninth year. Mr. Fothergill was the youngest son
of the Reverend Wilson Fothergill, of Timperleigh,
Leicestershire. Educated at Barrowhurst and at St. John's
College, Cambridge, he was for a time a journalist in
London before seeking his fortune abroad. Since 1920 he
had been closely associated with the plantation rubber
industry, and was the author of a standard work upon that
subject."</p>

<p>So proclaimed the obituary column of <i>The Times</i> on
the morning of October 19th, 1929. But <i>The Times</i> gets
to Roone's a day and a half late, and Fothergill was
already beneath the soil of Carrigole churchyard by then.
There had been some slight commotion over the burial; an
English priest had wired at the last moment that the man
was a Catholic. This seemed strange, for he had never been
noticed to go to Mass; but still, there was the telegram,
and since most Carrigole folk were buried as Catholics
anyway, the matter was not difficult to arrange.</p>

<p>There was also an inquest. Fothergill had apparently
died in his sleep; one of the maids took up his cup of tea
in the morning and actually left it on his bedside table
without knowing he was dead. She told the district coroner
she had said&mdash;"Here's your tea, sir," and that she
thought he had smiled in answer. Nobody found out the truth
till nearly noon. Then a doctor who happened to be staying
at the hotel saw the body and said it must have been
lifeless for at least ten hours.</p>

<p>Just in time for the inquest a London doctor arrived
to testify that Fothergill had consulted him some weeks
before about a heart complaint. It was the sort of thing
that might finish off anyone quite suddenly, so of course
all was clear, on the evidence, and the verdict 'Death from
natural causes' came in with record speed.</p>

<p>The whole affair provided an acute though temporary
sensation at Roone's Hotel, which, though the season
was almost over, chanced to be fairly full at the time
owing to a cruiser in harbour. Roone himself was rather
peeved; he was just beginning to work up his place after
the many years of 'trouble,' and it certainly did him no
good to have guests dying on him in such a way. He was
especially annoyed because it had all got into the Dublin
and London papers&mdash;that, of course, being due to
Halloran, Carrigole's too ambitious journalist, who would
(Roone said) sell his best friend's reputation for half a
guinea.</p>

<p>As for the dead man, Roone could only shrug his
shoulders. Rather crossly he told the occupants of his
crowded private bar how little he knew about the fellow.
Never set eyes on him till the September, when he had
arrived from Killarney one evening with a small suitcase.
Evidently hadn't meant to stop long, and at the end of
a week had sent to London for more luggage. Very quiet
sort, civil and all that, but somehow not the kind of
chap a fellow would naturally take to... Yes, practically
teetotal, too&mdash;nearly as bad for business as the
Cook's people who came loaded with coupons for all they
took and drank nothing but water. "Although, by the way,"
Roone added, "he did come in here for a nightcap the
evening before&mdash;I remember serving him."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember too," put in a plus-foured youth. "I
made some casual remark to him about something or other
just to be polite, that was all&mdash;but he hardly
answered me. Rather surly, I thought at the time."</p>

<p>At which Mrs. Roone intervened, tartly: "Of course it
was easy to see what he was stopping on here for, and more
shame to him, I say."</p>

<p>Everyone in the bar nodded, for everyone had been
waiting for that matter to be mentioned. There had been an
American girl staying at the hotel with her mother; the two
had been the only guests with whom the dead man had struck
up any sort of acquaintance. He had gone for drives and
picnics with them; he had taken his meals at their table;
he had sometimes danced with the girl in the evenings. He
was after her, Mrs. Roone said, bluntly, and as he had
plenty of money the artful old mother was trying to hook
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, so he had money, then?" enquired the youth in
plus-fours.</p>

<p>"Money? Why do you suppose that London doctor came all
the way here to give evidence at the inquest if it wasn't
for, a fine fat fee? As a matter of fact, there were some
people here a few weeks ago who said for sober truth they
knew he was worth half a million&mdash;all made out of
rubber, so they said." Mrs. Roone's voice rose to a shriek
as she added: "Half a million indeed, and old enough to be
the girl's father, as well as liable to drop dead at any
minute! Disgraceful, I say!"</p>

<p>"D'you think the girl was after him too?"</p>

<p>"Maybe she was. Girls will do anything for money these
days."</p>

<p>Here a youthful, red-cheeked naval lieutenant
interposed. "Personally, Mrs. Roone, I think I'd give her
the benefit of the doubt&mdash;the girl, I mean. I spoke to
her once or twice&mdash;danced with her once, too&mdash;and
she seemed to me a very quiet, innocent sort of kid."</p>

<p>He spoke rather shyly, and a colleague, who had drunk
quite enough, shouted: "Innocent? Too dam' innocent for
you, eh, Willie?"</p>

<p>"Anyhow," answered Mrs. Roone, with final truculence,
"the way they both cleared off was quite enough for me. The
very afternoon that we were all fussed and bothered about
finding the man dead, up comes the old woman to have her
bill made out in a hurry&mdash;must get away&mdash;catching
the boat at Queenstown, or something or other.
Disappointed, I suppose, because her trick hadn't worked in
time. I didn't see the girl before they left."</p>

<p>"Well, well, she's had a narrow escape," said Roone,
drinking, "though maybe not the narrowest she ever will
have if she's going to go about dancing with young naval
lieutenants, eh?"</p>

<p>They all laughed. Just then <i>The Times</i> arrived, and
somebody in the bar, opening the paper casually, discovered
Fothergill's obituary. They all crowded round and read
it through with growing exasperation&mdash;it told so
little that they would have liked to know. The son of a
country parson, a public-school neither good nor quite bad,
Cambridge, journalism, rubber. What could anyone make of
it? The youth in plus-fours fully expressed the general
opinion when he commented: "Doesn't sound a particularly
exciting career, does it?"</p>

<p>"And it says nothing about a wife," said Roone, "so I
suppose he never married."</p>

<p>That was doubtfully accepted as a probable
conclusion.</p>

<p>"Well, well," added Roone, pouring more whisky into
his soda, "he wasn't my kind of chap, and I don't care
who hears me say so. Neither a good Catholic nor a good
Protestant nor a good anything else, I should say."</p>

<p>Which seemed the end of a rather unpleasant matter.</p>

<h2><a id="part2"></a>PART II</h2>

<p class="first">AINSLEY JERGWIN FOTHERGILL was born in
1880. He had five brothers and four sisters, and his
father's living yielded seven hundred a year. His mother
died in 1881, having never quite got over her most recent
contribution to the family, and the Reverend Wilson, left
to keep house with ten children, wandered helplessly
about his parish as if he were the last person on earth
responsible for his own situation. He was a large,
heavily-built man, with fat hands and a bald head; he did
his job in a dull, conscientious way, and thrashed his
elder children irregularly and without relish. He was
an Evangelical and a Gladstonian Liberal; he disliked
Dissent, had hated the Oxford Movement, and had a
superstitious horror of Rome. It was his habit to preach
hour-long sermons explaining the exact meaning of Greek
and Hebrew words to a congregation largely composed of
farm-labourers.</p>

<p>A widowed sister came to keep house for him in due
course; her husband had been an army officer, accidentally
killed in India in an age when few officers of either
service ever died of anything more exciting than cirrhosis
of the liver. Aunt Nellie never tired of boasting of her
unique bereavement, and it was she who had principal
charge of Ainsley. She had been a school teacher in
earlier life, and along with two of his sisters the boy
obtained from her a fairly complete grounding in reading,
writing, simple arithmetic, and the sort of geography that
consists in knowing what belongs to England. Barbara and
Emily, fifteen months and two and a half years older than
their brother respectively, had no aptitude for learning
anything of any kind; Ainsley, even by the age of five,
had far outstripped them. He was, indeed, a bright, fairly
good-looking child&mdash;dark-eyed, dark-haired,
well-moulded, but perhaps (Aunt Nellie thought, doubtfully) 'a
little foreign-looking.'</p>

<p>Timperleigh was a dull village in the midst of passable
hunting country, and the Reverend Wilson, despite his small
income, managed to hunt once a week during the season. It
meant that the elder children could not be sent to a good
school, but that did not trouble him. He hunted in the same
joyless, downright manner as he preached and thrashed.
Sometimes the hunt would meet in the rectory drive and the
children would run about among the horses and dogs and
have their heads patted by high-up gruff voiced men in
scarlet coats. Ainsley liked this, but not quite so much
as he enjoyed having tea in the kitchen with Cook. She was
called Cook, but she was really only a good-natured person
of middle age who, being also mentally deficient, had been
willing for years to do all the rough work of the household
in return for a miserably poor wage. Ainsley was fond of
her, and the look of the large rectory kitchen, with the
window-panes slowly changing from grey to black and the
firelight flickering on all the pots and dish-covers, gave
him a comfortable feeling that he was certain only Cook
could share. And her talk seemed far more thrilling than
any fairy-story; she had been born in Whitechapel, and she
made Whitechapel seem a real place, full of real people
and real if horrible happenings; whereas Capernaum, which
his father talked about in Sunday sermons, and Gibraltar,
which Aunt Nellie insisted belonged to England, were vague,
shadowy, and impossible to believe in.</p>

<p>When Ainsley was seven, his father was killed in a
hunting mishap. Aunt Nellie, behind a seemly grief, was
again rather thrilled; next to being trampled to death on
an Indian polo-ground, to die on the hunting-field was
perhaps the most socially eligible of all earthly exits.
The boy, quite frankly, felt no grief at all; he had had
hardly anything to do with his father, having not yet
attained the age of chastisement. Nor was he old enough to
realise the problem presented by the existence of himself
and his nine brothers and sisters. There was practically
no money, not even an insurance; the family, in terms of
hard cash, was scarcely better off than that of a deceased
farm-labourer. Fortunately the Reverend Wilson had been
one of as large a family as his own, and communication
was soon and inevitably opened up with uncles and aunts,
many far distant and some almost mythical. After long and
peevish negotiations, the family was divided somehow or
other amongst such relatives, until only the two youngest
remained Then, in sheer desperation, a letter was written
to Sir Henry Jergwin, whose wife had been Aunt Helen, and
after whom the youngest Fothergill had been hopefully but
so far fruitlessly named. Could Sir Henry do anything for
Barbara, aged eight, and for Ainsley Jergwin, aged seven?
The great man commanded the children to visit him at his
London house; they were taken there by Aunt Nellie and
solemnly exhibited. After a week he decided; he would
have the boy, but not the girl. So Barbara, after further
struggles, was pushed on to one of the other uncles, while
Ainsley came to live at a big Victorian house in Bloomsbury
already inhabited by his uncle, a secretary, a butler, a
cook, a coachman, three maids, and a gardener.</p>

<p>Sir Henry, in fact, was tolerably rich. He had always
cultivated influential friendships in the City, and he
was also editor and proprietor of the <i>Pioneer</i>, a weekly
paper of Liberal views. Sixty-three years of age, with a
vigorous body, an alert mind, a mellow, booming voice, and
an impressively long and snow-white beard, he was almost
as well known as he wished to be. He entertained; he was
invited to speak at public dinners; he knew everybody;
Garibaldi had stayed a night at his house; Gladstone had
knighted him. Besides all this, his reputation as a man of
letters stood high&mdash;and curiously high, for he had
written nothing that could be considered really first-rate.
Only, all along, he had had the knack of making the most of
everything he did; even a very mediocre poem he had once
composed had managed an entry into most of the anthologies.
Somehow, too, he had got himself accepted as an authority
on Elizabethan literature; he had edited the Hathaway
edition of Shakespeare, and thousands of schoolchildren had
fumbled over his glossaries. Surmounting and in addition
to all else, the man was a character; should any big
controversy arise in the Press, he was always asked for
his opinion, and always, without fail, gave it. His views,
though unexciting, stood for something that still existed
in far greater proportions than the brilliant youngsters
realised&mdash;a certain slow and measured solemnity that
flowed in the bloodstream of every Englishman who had more
than a thousand pounds in Consols.</p>

<p>Sir Henry had begotten no children; he took Ainsley in
the spirit of a martyr bearing his cross, and in the same
spirit engaged a German governess. This capable person
added history and music to the list of things the boy was
supposed to have been taught; later on a beginning was
made with French and German. The great Sir Henry rarely
saw either him or her; sometimes, however, Ainsley was
conducted into the library 'to see the books' and to be
called 'my little man' and smiled at. "These," explained
Sir Henry, on more than one such occasion, sweeping his arm
towards the rows of shelves, "are my best friends, and some
day you will find them your best friends also." Ainsley
was never quite certain whether this was a promise or a
threat.</p>

<p>When he was twelve, Sir Henry sent him to
Barrowhurst.</p>

<p>Barrowhurst was not a very old foundation; Liberal and
Evangelical in tendency, it had several times entertained
Sir Henry as its Speech Day guest of honour. Situated in
wild moorland country, it provided a vast change from
the atmosphere of governesses and Bloomsbury gardens. At
first Ainsley revelled in the freedom suddenly offered
him; for the first time in his life he could walk about
on his own, read books of his own choosing, and make
friends without the frosty surveillance of grown-ups. He
did not, however, make many friends. He was rather shy
and reserved in manner; amongst the school in general he
was for a long time hardly known, and the masters did not
care for him, because he soon displayed that worst sin of
the schoolboy&mdash;an indisposition to fit into one or
other of the accepted classifications. He was not exactly
troublesome, and his work was always satisfactory; only,
somehow or other, he was difficult to get on with; he was
apt to ask questions which, though hardly impertinent, were
awkwardly unanswerable; he wouldn't respond, either, to the
usual gambits of schoolmasterly approach. For some reason
he hated games, yet he wasn't by any means the too brainy,
bookish youngster; on the contrary, he was physically
strong and sturdily built, and soon became actually the
best swimmer and gymnast the school had known for years.</p>

<p>There was another Fothergill at the school, of a
different family, and Ainsley, to avoid mistakes, always
signed his papers with a very large and distinguishable
'A.J.' This became such a characteristic that he began to
be called 'A.J.' by his friends, and the initials finally
became an accepted nickname.</p>

<p>In his third year he suddenly startled everybody by
leading a minor rebellion. There was a master at the
school named Smalljohn who had a system of discipline
for which A.J. had gradually conceived an overmastering
hatred. The system was this: Smalljohn stood in front of
the class, gold watch in hand, and said, "If the boy who
did so-and-so does not declare himself within twenty-five
seconds, I shall give the whole form an hour's detention."
One day, after confessing himself, under such threat of
vicarious doom, the author of some trivial misdeed, A.J.
calmly informed his fellows that it was the last time he
ever intended to do such a thing. Couldn't they see that
the system was not only unfair but perfectly easy to break
down if only they all tackled it the right way? And the
right way was for no one ever to confess; let them put up
with a few detentions&mdash;Smalljohn would soon get tired
of it when he found his system no longer worked. There
are a few Barrowhurst men who will still remember the
quiet-voiced boy arguing his case with an emphasis all the
more astonishing because it was the first case he had ever
been known to argue.</p>

<p>He carried the others with him enthusiastically,
and the next day came the test. He was whispering to a
neighbour; Smalljohn heard and asked who it was. Silence.
Then: "If the person who whispered does not confess within
twenty-five seconds, the whole form will be detained for an
hour." Silence. "Fifteen seconds more... Ten seconds...
Five... Very well, gentlemen, I will meet the form at
half-past one in this room."</p>

<p>After that afternoon's detention Smalljohn announced:
"I am sorry indeed that thirty-three of your number have
had to suffer on behalf of a certain thirty-fourth person,
whose identity, I may say, I very strongly suspect. I can
assure him that I do not intend to let a coward escape, and
I am therefore grieved to say that until he owns up I shall
be compelled to repeat this detention every day."</p>

<p>It was nearing the time of house-matches and detentions
were more than usually tiresome. A.J. soon found his
enemies active, and even his friends inclined to be
cool. After the third detention he was, in fact, rather
disgracefully bullied, and after the fourth he gave in and
confessed. He had expected Smalljohn to be very stern, and
was far more terrified to find him good-humoured. "Pangs of
conscience, eh, Fothergill?" he queried, and A.J. replied:
"No, sir."</p>

<p>"No? That sounds rather defiant, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>A.J. did not answer, and Smalljohn, instead of getting
into a temper, positively beamed. "My dear Fothergill,
I quite understand. You think my system's unfair, don't
you?&mdash;I have heard mysterious rumours to that effect,
anyhow. Well, my boy, I daresay you're right. It is
unfair. It makes you see how impossible it is for you to
be a sneak and a coward&mdash;it brings out your better
self&mdash;that better self which, for some perverse
reason, you were endeavouring to stifle. To a boy who is
really not half the bad fellow he tries to make out, my
system is perhaps the unfairest thing in the world...
Well, you have been punished, I doubt not&mdash;for apart
from the still small voice, your comrades, I understand,
have somewhat cogently expressed their disapproval. In the
circumstances, then, I shall not punish you any further.
And now stay and have some cocoa with me."</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, sir," answered A.J. not very
coherently, "I'm afraid I must go. I've got a letter 'to
finish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, then&mdash;some other evening.
Good-night."</p>

<p>And the next morning Smalljohn, whose worst crime was
that he thought he understood boys, recounted in the
common-room how magnanimity had melted young Fothergill
almost to tears&mdash;how with shaking voice the boy had
declined the cocoa invitation and had asked to be allowed
to go.</p>

<p>It had been A.J.'s first fight, and he fully realised
that he had lost. What troubled him most was not
Smalljohn's victory but the attitude of his fellows; if
they, had only stood with him, Smalljohn could have been
defeated. Yet they called him a coward because in Rugby
football, which he was compelled to play although he
disliked it, he sometimes showed that he didn't consider it
worth while to get hurt. At the end of his third year the
headmaster's report summed him up, not too unreasonably,
as: "A thoughtful boy, with many good qualities, but apt to
be obstinate and self-opinionated. Is hardly getting out of
Barrowhurst all he should."</p>

<p>A.J. had two adventures at Barrowhurst altogether;
the first was the Smalljohn affair, which was no more
than a nine days' wonder and certainly did not add to
his popularity; but the second was in a different class:
it established his fame on a suddenly Olympian basis,
and passed, indeed, into the very stuff of Barrowhurst
tradition. Two miles away from the school is the tunnel
that carries the Scotch expresses under the Pennines. It
is over three miles long, boring under the ridge from
one watershed to another. A.J. walked through it one
school half-holiday. Platelayers met him staggering out,
half-deafened and half-suffocated, with eyes inflamed,
soot-blackened face, and hands bleeding where he had groped
his way along the tunnel wall. He was taken to the school
in a cab, and had to spend a week in bed; after which he
was thrashed by the headmaster. He gave no explanation of
his escapade beyond the fact that he had wanted to discover
what it would be like. He agreed that the experience had
been thoroughly unpleasant.</p>

<p>A.J.'s fourth year was less troubled. He was in the
sixth form by then, preparing for Cambridge, and was left
to do pretty much as he liked. The tunnel affair had given
him prestige of an intangible kind both with boys and
masters, and he spent much of his time reading odd books on
all kinds of subjects that form no part of a public-school
curriculum. He cycled miles about the moorland countryside,
picking up fossils and making rubbings of old brasses in
churches; he also (and somehow quite incidentally) achieved
an official Barrowhurst record by a long jump of twenty
feet. His sixth-form status carried prefecture with it,
and rather to everyone's surprise he made an excellent
prefect&mdash;straightforward, firm, and tolerant.</p>

<p>He went to Cambridge in the autumn of 1898; his rooms at
St. John's overlooked the river and the Backs, being among
the best situated in the University. Sir Henry made him a
fairly generous allowance, and began to hope that the boy
might prove some good after all, despite the tepid reports
from Barrowhurst. A.J. liked Cambridge, of course. He
didn't have to play games, there were no schoolmasters with
their irritating systems, he could read his queer books,
listen to string quartets, and wield a geologist's hammer
to his heart's content. The only thing he seemed definitely
disinclined for was the sort of work that would earn him a
decent degree. Sir Henry encouraged him to join the Union,
and he did so, though he never spoke. He made one or two
close friends, and was well liked by those who knew him at
all. (He was still called 'A.J.'&mdash;the nickname had
followed him to Cambridge through the agency of Barrowhurst
men.) Most of the vacations he spent in Bloomsbury; of
late years he had seen less and less of his brothers and
sisters, several of whom had emigrated. He also travelled
abroad a little&mdash;just to the usual places in France,
Germany, and Switzerland.</p>

<p>He had no particular adventures in Cambridge, and
left no mark on university history unless it were by the
foundation of a short-lived fencing club. He had picked
up a certain skill with the foils in Germany; it was a
typically odd sort of thing to capture his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>He took a mediocre pass degree in his third year and
then wondered what on earth came next. Sir Henry was
disappointed and made it very clear that he did not intend
to support him any longer. A.J. fully agreed; he did not
want to be supported; he would certainly find something to
do of some kind or other, but he was completely vague about
it, and there were so many jobs which, for one reason or
another, were impossible. He did not care for the services;
he had no vocation for the church; his degree was not
good enough for school-mastering or for diplomacy or for
the law. Clearly then, very little remained, and when, in
the summer of 1901, he left Cambridge for good, it was
understood that he was to become a journalist and that Sir
Henry would 'find him something.' In August he went abroad
for a month, and it was while he was doing the conventional
Rhine tour that he received a typewritten letter signed
'Philippa Warren' and conveying the information that
Sir Henry's former secretary, a Mr. Watts, had died of
pneumonia and that she had been appointed instead. He
thought little of it, or of her, except to reflect that
Sir Henry's choice of a female secretary would probably be
based on dignity rather than elegance. At the beginning
of September he returned to London and found there was to
be a big dinner-party on his first evening, which annoyed
him slightly, as it meant he had to unpack everything in a
hurry so as to dress. Sir Henry's sister, a Mrs. Holdron,
was hostess; she said&mdash;"Oh, Ainsley, will you take
in Miss Warren?"&mdash;and he smiled agreement and tried
vaguely to associate the name with any particular one of
the dozen or so strangers to whom he had been perfunctorily
and indistinctly introduced. He had completely forgotten
the Philippa Warren who had written to him.</p>

<p>The reception room was on the first floor, overlooking
the square, and all its windows were wide open and
unshuttered to admit the soft breeze of a September night.
He felt an arm slipped into his and guiding him rather
than being guided through the plush-curtained archway
into the long and rather gloomy corridor that led to the
dining-room, Almost simultaneously they both made the same
banal remark about the weather, whereupon she laughed and
added, with a sort of crystal mockery: "I said it first,
Mr. Fothergill." He laughed back, but could not think of an
answer.</p>

<p>In the dining-room that looked on to the typical
brick-walled oblong garden of London houses, he glanced at
her curiously. She was young, and full of a vitality that
interested him. Her dark, roving eyes gave poise, and even
beauty, to a face that might not otherwise have seemed
noteworthy. Her nose was long and well-shaped, but her
lips were perhaps too small and thin, just as her forehead
looked too high. She certainly was not pretty. Not till
half-way through the meal did he realise that she must be
Sir Henry's new secretary.</p>

<p>It was a distinguished gathering, in a small
way&mdash;professors and professors' wives, a Harley
Street surgeon, a titled lawyer, journalists, a few
M.P.'s&mdash;all, of course, dominated by the patriarchal
figure of Sir Henry himself. He was now seventy-seven,
broad-shouldered, straight-backed, with leonine head
and flashing eye&mdash;a truly eminent Victorian who had
survived, wonderfully preserved, into the new reign. He
had long ago reached the age when people said that he
'still' did things. He still owned the <i>Pioneer</i>, which,
after a stormy career in the 'sixties and 'seventies,
had settled down, like Sir Henry himself, to an old
age of ever-slightly-increasing respectability and
ever-slightly-diminishing circulation.</p>

<p>The odd part of it (to A.J.) was the way Philippa
Warren had suddenly fitted herself into Sir Henry's scheme
of things. She seemed already to take both him and his
views equally for granted; she was at once casual and
proprietary, like a guide displaying a museum piece;
she realised quite simply that Sir Henry had become an
institution and that visitors liked to hear him gossip in
an intimate way about great names that were already in the
history books. She would give him conversational cues, such
as&mdash;'That's rather what Matthew Arnold used to tell
you, isn't it, Sir Henry?'&mdash;or&mdash;'Sir Henry, I'm
sure Mr. So-and-so would like to hear about your meeting
with Thackeray.' She rarely expressed opinions of her
own, but she knew exactly, like a well-learned lesson,
the precise attitude of Sir Henry towards every topic of
the day. It was almost uncanny, and from the beginning
A.J. found himself queerly fascinated. She had a clear,
icy mind; she could compress her ideas into an epigram
where others might have needed to employ a speech. On
hearing about the Barrowhurst and Cambridge nickname she
immediately called him 'A.J.' and expected him to call her
'Philippa'; he was certain, from the first half-hour of the
dinner-party, that they were destined for the most intimate
of friendships.</p>

<p>After a week he was less positive, and after a month
he was frankly puzzled and doubtful. He seemed so early
to have reached an unsurmountable barrier; she would
talk about anything and everything with the utterest
frankness, yet somehow, after it all, he felt that it
had no connection with getting to know her. Sir Henry,
of course, never ceased to sing her praises. She was the
model secretary; how he had ever managed so many years with
that fellow Watts, he could hardly think. The scene in the
library every morning at ten o'clock when Philippa arrived
to begin work was almost touching. Sir Henry, stirred to a
gallantry that had never been his in earlier days, would
greet her with a benign smile, pat her shoulder and ask
after her health, and, if he imagined or chose to imagine
that she looked tired, would ring for a glass of sherry.
And she on her side grudgingly yet somehow gratefully
permitted time to be wasted on such courtesies.</p>

<p>A.J. agreed that she was marvellous. Her merely physical
effect on the old man was remarkable; there came a sparkle
into his eyes and a springiness into his walk that had not
been seen since the first Jubilee. A.J. judged, too, that
she did other things; Sir Henry's occasional articles in
the Press (writing was one of those things he 'still' did)
became more frequent, more varied, and&mdash;if that were
possible&mdash;more characteristic of him than ever. Once
A.J. glanced over her shoulder when she was working; she
was preparing notes, she said, for some centenary article
on Elizabethan literature that Sir Henry had promised to
write. In neat, verbless phrases she had selected just
the material he would need&mdash;'Marlowe in his worst
moments grandiloquent and turgid'&mdash;'<i>Fairy Queen</i> a
monument of literary atavism'&mdash;'<i>Titus Andronicus</i>
probably not Shakespeare's'&mdash;and so on. Sir Henry
did the rest, and how well he did it, too, and with what
a sublime flavour of personality! A.J. kept the article
when it appeared, underlining such sentences as&mdash;'I
do not think it can be denied that in his less happy
moments Marlowe was occasionally guilty of a certain
grandiloquence of phraseology&mdash;almost, I might say,
turgidity'&mdash;'I cannot but think that the <i>Faerie
Queene</i>, regarded from a strictly literary viewpoint, is
in some sense atavistic'&mdash;and&mdash;'I have yet to
discover any arguments that would lead me to suppose that
<i>Titus Andronicus</i> was, in its entirety, a work by the
master-hand that penned <i>Lear</i> and <i>Othello</i>.'</p>

<p>A.J. was kept fairly busy during the years that
followed. Sir Henry got him reviewing jobs on the <i>Comet</i>
and other papers, besides which he wrote occasionally for
the <i>Pioneer</i> and was also understood to be at work upon a
novel. But the plain truth soon became apparent that he was
no good at all as a journalist. He was too conscientious,
if anything; he read too carefully before he reviewed, and
he gave his opinions too downrightly&mdash;he had none of
Sir Henry's skill in praising with faint damns. Nor had
he the necessary journalistic flair for manufacturing an
attitude at a moment's notice; he would say 'I don't know'
or 'I have no opinion' far oftener than was permissible
in Fleet Street. He even, after several years, gave up
his projected novel for the excellent but ignominious
reason that he could not make up his mind what it was
to be about. But for the fact that Sir Henry was behind
him, his journalistic career would hardly have lasted
very long. Aitchison, the <i>Comet</i> editor, could never
use more than a fraction of the stuff he sent in, though
personally he liked the youth well enough and was sorry to
see him slaving away at tasks for which he had so little
aptitude.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at the Bloomsbury house, A.J.'s friendship
with Philippa continued and perhaps a little progressed.
Gradually and at first imperceptibly a warmer feeling
uprose on his side, but there was nothing tumultuous in
it; indeed, he chaffed himself in secret for indulging
something so mild and purposeless. He had certainly nothing
to hope for; apart from his own lack of prospects, she had
so often, in the course of their talks, conveyed how little
she cared for men and for the conventional woman's career
of marriage and home life. Nor, for that matter, had A.J.
any particularly domestic dreams. In a way, that was why
she attracted him so much; she was so unlike the usual type
of girl who fussed and expected to be fussed over.</p>

<p>Then suddenly something quite astonishing happened. It
was rather like the Smalljohn episode at Barrowhurst; it
occurred so sharply and unexpectedly, and to the completest
surprise of those who thought that A.J. was, if anything,
too sober a fellow. Philippa, he discovered, was an ardent
supporter of the woman's suffrage movement, though, in
deference to Sir Henry's views on the matter, she kept
her ardours out of the house. She was not a militant,
but Sir Henry made no distinctions of such a kind; he
was genuinely and comprehensively indignant over the
burnings, picture-slashings, and other outrages of which
the newspapers were full. Philippa realised how hopeless it
was to convert him, while as for A.J., she probably did not
consider his support even worth the trouble of securing.
Yet, without effort, it was secured. A.J., in fact, dashed
into the movement with an enthusiasm which even his
greatest friends considered rather fatuous; there was no
stopping him; he went to meetings, walked in processions,
and wasted hours of his time writing propagandist
articles which Aitchison turned down with ever-increasing
acerbity. He really was caught up in a whirl of passionate
indignation, and neither Sir Henry's anger nor Philippa's
indifference could check the surge of that emotion.</p>

<p>The whole thing ended in quite a ridiculous fiasco; he
got himself arrested for attacking a policeman who was
trying to arrest a suffragette who had just thrown a can of
paint into a cabinet minister's motor-car. The magistrate
seemed glad to have a man to be severe with; he gave A.J.
seven days, without the option of a fine, and, of course,
the case was prominently reported in all the papers.</p>

<p>At Brixton jail A.J. thought at first he would
hunger-strike, but he soon perceived that hunger-striking
during a seven-days' sentence could not be very effective;
the authorities would merely let him do it. He therefore
took the prison food and spent most of his time in rather
miserable perplexity. He had, he began to realise, made a
complete ass of himself.</p>

<p>When he was discharged at the end of the week he hoped
and rather expected that Philippa, at any rate, would have
some word of sympathy for him. Instead of that, she greeted
him very frigidly. "What an extraordinary thing to do!" was
all she commented. Sir Henry was far from frigid; he was as
furious as a man of eighty dare permit himself to be. He
had A.J. in the library for over an hour telling him what
he thought. A.J. must clear out&mdash;that was the general
gist of the discourse; Sir Henry would no longer permit
their names to be connected in any way. If A.J. chose to
emigrate (which seemed the best solution of the problem),
Sir Henry would give him a hundred pounds as a final
expression of regard&mdash;but it was to be definitely
final&mdash;no pathetic letters begging for more. A.J.
said: "You needn't fear that, anyhow." In the midst of the
rather unpleasant discussion, Philippa entered the library,
fresh and charming as usual, whereupon Sir Henry, his mood
changing in an instant, remarked: "Perhaps, my dear, we had
better tell Ainsley our piece of news."</p>

<p>She barely nodded and Sir Henry went on, more severely
as he turned to A.J.&mdash;"Philippa has done me the honour
of promising to be my wife."</p>

<p>A.J. stared speechlessly at them both. He saw the
green-shaded desk-lamp spinning round before his eyes and
the expanse of bookshelves dissolving into a multi-coloured
haze. Then he felt himself going hot, shamefully hot; he
managed to stammer: "I&mdash;I must&mdash;congratulate
you&mdash;both."</p>

<p>Philippa was not looking at him.</p>

<p>His eyes kept wandering from one to the other of them;
she was so beautiful, he perceived now, and Sir Henry, with
all his sprightliness, was so monstrously old. He had never
noticed before how hideous were those rolls of fat between
his chin and his neck, and how he very slightly slobbered
over his sibilants.</p>

<p>"Yes, I congratulate you," he repeated.</p>

<p>He went out for lunch, paced up and down in Regent's
Park during the afternoon, and spent the evening at a
restaurant and a music-hall. Towards midnight he went to
the <i>Comet</i> office and asked to see Aitchison. Aitchison,
a hard-bitten Scotsman of sixty, smiled rather cynically
when A.J. suggested being sent abroad as a foreign
correspondent; he guessed the reason, and personally
thought it not at all a bad idea that A.J. should live down
his notoriety abroad. There was, of course, no moral stigma
attached to a seven-day sentence for trying to rescue a
suffragette, but the boy had made a fool of himself and one
can be laughed out of a profession as well as drummed out.
The foreign correspondent notion, however, was hopeless;
A.J. would be as useless, journalistically, abroad as at
home. Aitchison knew all this well enough, and when A.J.
further went on to suggest being sent out to the Far East
to report the Russo-Japanese War which had just begun, he
laughed outright. It was impossible, he answered; jobs
like that required experience, and A.J. possessed none;
reporting a war wasn't like writing a highbrow middle about
the stained-glass at Chartres. Besides, it would all be
far too expensive; the <i>Comet</i> wasn't a wealthy paper and
probably wouldn't have a correspondent of its own at all.
To which A.J. replied that, as for money, he had a little
himself and was so anxious to try his luck that he would
willingly spend it in travelling out East if the <i>Comet</i>
would give him credentials as its correspondent and take
anything he sent that was acceptable. Aitchison thought
this over and quickly reached the conclusion that it was an
ideal arrangement&mdash;for the <i>Comet</i>. It was, to begin
with, a way of getting rid of A.J., and it was also a way
by which the <i>Comet</i> could obtain all the kudos of having
a war-correspondent without the disagreeable necessity of
footing the bill for his expenses&mdash;though, of course,
if A.J. did send them anything good the <i>Comet</i> would be
delighted to pay for it. And in haste less A.J. should see
any flaw in this most admirable scheme, Aitchison accepted,
adding: "Naturally you'll bear in mind the policy of this
paper&mdash;we don't much care for the Russians, you
know. Not much use you sending us stuff we can't print,
especially when it'll cost you God knows how much a word to
cable."</p>

<p>A.J. left for Siberia at the beginning of April. Sir
Henry declined either to approve or to disapprove of the
arrangement; all he made clear was that A.J. could not
expect any more chances, and that, if he wanted the hundred
pounds, he must go abroad as one of the prime conditions.
Siberia was undoubtedly abroad; its prospects for the
emigrant were A.J.'s affair entirely. During the last week
of hectic preparation that preceded the departure A.J. saw
rather little of the old man, and the final good-byes both
with him and with Philippa were very formal.</p>

<p>No one saw him off at Charing Cross, and he felt
positive relief when, a couple of hours later, the boat
swung out of Dover Harbour and he saw England fading into
the mist of a spring morning. Two days afterwards he was in
Berlin; and two days after that in Moscow. There he caught
the Trans-Siberian express and began the ten-days' train
journey to Irkutsk.</p>

<p>The train was comfortable but crowded, and most of
the way he studied a Russian grammar and phrase-book.
Every mile that increased his distance from London added
to a certain bitter zest that he felt; whatever was to
happen, success or failure, was sure to be preferable to
book-reviewing in Bloomsbury. His trouble had always been
to know what to write about, and surely a war must solve
such a problem for him. It was an adventure, anyway, to
be rolling eastward over the Siberian plains. He met no
fellow-countryman till he reached Irkutsk, where several
other newspaper-correspondents were waiting to cross
Lake Baikal. They were all much older men than he was,
and most of them spoke Russian fluently. They seemed
surprised and somewhat amused that such a youngster had
been sent out by the <i>Comet</i>, and A.J., scenting the
attitude of superiority, preferred the companionship of
a young Italian who represented a Milan news agency. The
two conversed together in bad French almost throughout
the crossing of the lake in the ice-breaker. It was an
impressive journey; the mountains loomed up on all sides
like steel-grey phantoms, and the clear atmosphere was
full of a queer other-world melancholy. Barellini, the
Italian, gave A.J. his full life-history, which included
a passionate love-affair with a wealthy Russian woman in
Rome. A.J. listened tranquilly, watching the ice spurt
from the bow of the ship and shiver into glittering
fragments; the sun was going down; already there was
an Arctic chill in the air. Barellini then talked of
Russian women in general, and of that touch of the East
which mingled with their Western blood and made them, he
said, beyond doubt' the most fascinating women in the
world. He quoted Shakespeare&mdash;'Other women cloy the
appetites they feed, but she makes hungry where she most
satisfies'&mdash;Cleopatra, that was&mdash;Shakespeare
could never have said such a thing about any Western
woman. "But I suppose you prefer your English women?" he
queried, with an inquisitiveness far too childlike to be
resented. A.J. answered that his acquaintance with the sex
was far too small for him to attempt comparisons. "Perhaps,
then, you do not care for any women very much?" persisted
Barellini, and quoted Anatole France&mdash;'De toutes
les aberrations sexuelles, la plus singulière, c'est la
chasteté.' "For thousands of years," he added, "people have
been trying to say the really brilliant and final thing
about sex&mdash;and there it is!"</p>

<p>Barellini was very useful when they reached the train
at the further side of the lake. There was a curious
and rather likeable spontaneity about him that enabled
him to do things without a thought of personal dignity
(which, in fact, he neither needed nor possessed), and
when he found the train already full of a shouting and
screaming mob, he merely flung himself into the midst of
it, shouted and screamed like the rest, and managed in the
end to secure two seats in a third-class coach. He had no
concealments and no embarrassments; his excitableness, his
determination, his inquisitiveness, his everlasting talk
about women, were all purified, some-how, by the essential
naturalness that lay behind them all. The train was full
of soldiers, with whom he soon became friendly, playing
cards with them sometimes and telling stories, probably
very gross, that convulsed them with laughter. The soldiers
were very polite and gave up the best places to A.J. and
the Italian; they also made tea for them and brought them
food from the station buffets. When A.J. saw the English
correspondents bawling from first-class compartments to
station officials who took little notice of them, he
realised how much more fortunate he had been himself The
hours slipped by very pleasantly; as he sat silent in his
corner-seat listening to continual chatter which he did not
understand and watching the strange monotonous landscape
through the window, he began to feel a patient and rather
comfortable resignation such as a grown-up feels with a
party of children. The soldiers laughed and were noisy in
just the sharp, instant way that children have; they had
also the child's unwavering heartlessness. One of them in
the next coach fell on to the line as he was larking about,
and all his companions roared with laughter, even though
they could see he was badly injured.</p>

<p>Harbin was reached after a week's slow travelling from
Irkutsk. At first sight it seemed the unpleasantest town in
the world; its streets were deep in mud; its best hotel (in
which Barellini obtained accommodation) was both villainous
and expensive; and its inhabitants seemed to consist of all
the worst ruffians of China and Siberia. Many of them were,
in fact, ex-convicts. A.J. was glad to set out the next
day for Mukden, in which he expected to have to make his
headquarters for some time. The thirty-six hours' journey
involved another scrimmage for places on the train, but
he was getting used to such things now, and Barellini's
company continued to make all things easy. He was beginning
to like the talkative Italian, despite the too-frequently
amorous themes of his conversation, and when he suggested
that they should join forces in whatever adventures were
available, A.J. gladly agreed.</p>

<p>A.J. had no romantic illusions about warfare, and
was fully prepared for horrors. He was hardly, however,
prepared for the extraordinary confusion and futility of
large-scale campaigning between modern armies. Nobody at
Mukden seemed to have definite information about anything
that was happening; the town was full of-preposterous
rumours, and most of the inhabitants were rapidly
growing rich out of the war business. All the foreign
correspondents were quartered in a Chinese inn, forming
a little international club, with a preponderance of
English-speaking members. A.J. found the other Englishmen
less stand-offish when he got to know them better; several
became quite friendly, and gave him valuable tips about
cabling his news, and so on. The trouble was that there was
so little news to cable.</p>

<p>The ancient Chinese city wore an air of decay that
contrasted queerly with the sudden mushroom vitality
infused by the war. A.J. had plenty of time for wandering
about among the picturesque sights of the place; indeed
after a week, he knew Mukden very much better than he knew
Paris or Berlin. Then came the sudden though long-awaited
permission for war-correspondents to move towards the
actual battle-front. Barellini and A.J. were both attached
to a Cossack brigade, and after a tiresome journey of some
sixty miles found themselves courteously but frigidly
welcomed by General Kranazov and his staff. The general
spoke French perfectly, as also did most of his officers.
He obviously did not like the English, but he talked
about English literature to A.J. with much learning and
considerable shrewdness.</p>

<p>During that first week with the Cossacks nothing
happened, though from time to time there came sounds of
gun-fire in the distance. Then one morning, about five
o'clock, a servant who had been detailed to attend on him
woke A.J. to announce that a battle was beginning about
four miles away and that if he climbed a hill near by he
might perhaps see something of it. While he was hastily
dressing, Barellini, who had been similarly wakened, joined
him, and soon the two were trudging over the dusty plain in
the fast-warming sunlight.</p>

<p>They climbed the low hill and lay down amongst the
scrub. For several hours nothing was to be seen; then
suddenly, about nine o'clock, a violent cannonade began
over the next range of hills and little puffs of white
smoke a couple of miles away showed where shells were
bursting. A staff officer approached them and explained
the position; the Russians were over here, the Japanese
over there, and so on. It was all very confusing and not
at all what A.J. had imagined. The sun rose higher and
the cannonade grew in intensity; Russian batteries were
replying. Barellini talked, as usual, about women; A.J.
actually dozed a little until another staff officer ran to
tell them to move off, as the Russian line was beginning
to retreat. They obeyed, descending the hill and walking a
mile or so to the rear. By this time they were dog-tired
and thirsty. A Chinese trader on the road offered them some
Shanghai beer at an extortionate figure; Barellini beat him
down to half his price and bought four bottles, which they
drank there and then with great relish.</p>

<p>And that, by pure mischance, was all that A.J. saw of
the actual Russo-Japanese War, for the beer had been mixed
with foul water, and that same evening, after sending a
long cable to the <i>Comet</i>, he fell violently ill and had
to be taken to the base hospital. There his case was at
first neglected, for it was hardly to be expected' that
the doctors, in the after-battle rush of work, should pay
much attention to a foreign war-correspondent with no
visible ailment. Later, however, when his temperature was
a hundred and four and he was in the most obvious agony,
they changed their attitude and gave him good nursing
and careful attention. For a fortnight his life was in
danger; then he began to recover. The hospital was clean
and well-managed, though there was a shortage of drugs and
bandages. Barellini, on whom the bad beer had had no ill
effects at all, visited him from time to time, as also did
some of the other correspondents. It was universally agreed
that he had met with the most atrocious luck. Afterwards,
however, he looked back upon his period in hospital as the
time when he really began to know Russia and the Russians.
To begin with, he made great progress with the language.
None of the nurses or patients could speak any English and
after his third week in hospital he found himself beginning
to converse with them fairly easily. What struck him most
was the general eagerness to help him; he could not imagine
a foreigner in a London hospital being so treated. Both
men next to him were badly wounded (one in the stomach and
the other with both legs amputated), yet both took a keen
delight in teaching him new words. They were middle-aged,
with wives and families thousands of miles west; they
accepted their lot with a fatalism that was bewildered
rather than stoic. One of them always screamed when his
wounds were being dressed, and always apologised to A.J.
afterwards for having disturbed him. Neither could read
or write, yet when A.J. read to them, very haltingly and
with very bad pronunciation, from a book by Gogol, they
listened enthralled. They were devoutly religious and also
very superstitious. They had not the slightest idea why
their country was fighting Japan, but they assumed it must
be God's will. The one with the amputations did not seem
to worry very much; his attitude seemed chiefly one of
puzzlement. It had all happened so quickly, almost as soon
as he had gone into battle; he had had no time to fight any
of the enemy; indeed, it was as if he had travelled seven
thousand miles merely to have his legs blown off. He could
not get rid of a dim feeling that the Japanese must have
been personally angry with him to have done such a thing.
He felt no vindictiveness, however. There was a badly
wounded Japanese in the ward; the men treated him very
courteously and often spoke sympathetically to one another
about him. As they did not know a word of his language nor
he a word of theirs, it was all that could be done.</p>

<p>Both A.J.'s neighbours told him all about themselves
and showed the frankest curiosity about his own life.
They thought it very strange that people in England were
so interested in the war that they would send out men
especially to describe it for them, and they were amazed
when A.J. told them how much his journey had cost, the
price of his cables to the <i>Comet</i>, and so on. They
listened with great interest to anything he told them about
English life, English politics, and so on, though such
matters were difficult to compress within the confines
of his still limited Russian. They always showed their
appreciation with the most childlike directness, often
giving him articles of food which he really did not want,
but which he could not refuse without risk of hurting their
feelings.</p>

<p>The effect of his weeks in hospital was to give him
an extraordinarily real and deep affection for these
simple-hearted men as well as a bitter indignation against
the scheme of things that had driven them from their homes
to be maimed and shattered in a quarrel they did not even
understand. The fact that they did not complain themselves
made him all the more inclined to complain for them, and
the constant ingress of fresh wounded to take the place
of men who died had a poignantly cumulative effect upon
his emotions. He had already cabled Aitchison about his
illness, promising to resume his job as soon as he could;
now he began to feel that his real message might be sent
as appropriately from a bed in hospital as from a position
near the lines. After all, it was the tragic cost of war
that people needed to realise; they were in no danger of
forgetting its excitements and occasional glories. In such
a mood he began to compose cables which a friendly nurse
despatched for him from the local telegraph-office. He
described the pathos and heroism of the Russian wounded,
their childlike patience and utter lack of hatred for the
enemy, their willingness to endure what they could not
understand. After his third cable on such lines a reply
came from Aitchison&mdash;'Cannot use your stuff advise you
return immediately sending out Ferguson.' So there it was;
he was cashiered, sacked; they were sending out Ferguson,
the well-known traveller and war-correspondent who had made
his name in South Africa. A.J. was acidly disappointed, of
course, and also (when he came to think about it) rather
worried about the future. There was nothing for it but to
pack up and return to Europe as soon as he was fit to leave
hospital&mdash;to Europe, but not to England. The thought
of London, of the London streets, and of Fleet Street,
especially, appalled him in a way he could not exactly
analyse. He had a little money still left and began to
think of living in France or Germany as long as it held
out, and as the most obvious economy he would travel back
third-class. He left hospital at the beginning of August
and caught the first train west. The discomfort of sleeping
night after night on a plank bed without undressing did not
prevent him from enjoying the journey; the train itself was
spacious and the halts at stations were long and frequent
enough to give ample opportunity for rest and exercise. His
companions were nearly all soldiers, most of them returning
to their homes after sickness or wounds, and their company
provided a constant pageant of interest and excitement. The
long pauses at places he felt he would almost certainly
never visit again and whose names he would almost certainly
never remember, gave an atmosphere of epic endlessness
to the journey; and there was the same atmosphere in his
talks to fellow-travellers, with some of whom he became
very intimate. Sometimes, especially when sunset fell upon
the strange, empty plains, a queer feeling of tranquillity
overspread him; he felt that he wanted never to go back to
London at all; the thought of any life in the future like
his old Fleet Street life filled his mind with inquietude.
And then the train would swing into the dreaming rhythm
of the night, and the soldiers in the compartment would
light their candles and stick them into bottles on the
window-ledges, and begin to sing, or to laugh, or to
chatter. Siberia surprised him by being quite hot, and
sometimes the night passed in a cloud of perfume, wafted
from fields of flowers by the railside. Then, early in the
morning, there would be a halt at some little sun-scorched
station, where the soldiers would fetch hot water to make
tea and where A.J. could get down and stretch his legs
while the train-crew loaded wood into the tender. Often
they waited for hours in sidings, until troop trains passed
them going east, and for this reason the return journey
took much longer than the eastward one.</p>

<p>At a station a few hundred miles from the European
frontier A.J. got into conversation with a well-dressed
civilian whom he found himself next to in the
refreshment-room. The man was obviously well educated, and
discussed the war and other topics in a way that might
have been that of any other cultured European. He made
the usual enquiries as to what A.J. was doing and who he
was; then he congratulated him on his Russian, which he
said was surprisingly good for one who had had to learn so
quickly. The two got on excellently until the departure of
the train; then they had to separate, since the Russian was
travelling first-class.</p>

<p>At the next halt, three hours later, they met again in
a similar way, and the Russian expressed surprise that
A.J. should be travelling so humbly. A.J. answered, with
a frankness he saw no reason to check, that he was doing
things as cheaply as possible because he had so little
money. This led to further questions and explanations,
after which the Russian formally presented his card,
which showed him to be a certain Doctor Hamarin, of
Rostov-on-Don. He was, he said, the headmaster of a school
there; his pupils came from the best families in the
district. If A.J. wished to earn a little money and was
not in any great hurry to return to England (for so much
he had gathered), why not consider taking a temporary post
in Russia? And there and then he offered him the job of
English master in his school. A.J. thanked him and said he
would think it over; he thought it over, and at the next
station jumped eagerly to the platform, met Hamarin as
before, and said he would accept.</p>

<p>So he settled down at Rostov. It was a pleasantly
prosperous city, with a climate cold and invigorating
in winter and mild as the French Riviera in summer; it
was also very much more cosmopolitan than most places
of its size, for, as the business capital of the Don
Cossack country, it contained many Jews, Armenians,
Greeks and even small colonies of English, French, and
Germans. Picturesquely built, with many fine churches, it
was interesting to live in, though A.J. had no initial
intention of staying in it for long. He did, in fact,
stay there for two years, which was about four times his
estimate. His work was simple&mdash;merely to teach English
to the sons and daughters of Rostov's plutocratic rather
than aristocratic families. He made a successful teacher,
which is to say that he did not need to work very hard;
he had plenty of leisure, and during holidays was able
to take trips into the Caucasus, the Crimea, and several
times to Moscow and Petersburg.. With a natural aptitude
for languages, he came to talk Russian without a trace of
foreign accent, besides picking up a working knowledge
of Tartar, Armenian, and various local dialects. He was
moderately happy and only bored now and again. A physical
change became noticeable in him; he lost, rather suddenly,
the boyish undergraduate air that had surprised the other
war-correspondents when they had first seen him. He was
liked by his pupils and respected by their parents; he
moved a little on the fringe of the better-class town
society, which was as high as a schoolmaster could well
expect. He soon found that his profession carried with
it little dignity of its own. During his first week at
school the daughter of one of Rostov's wealthiest families,
in sending up a very bad English translation exercise,
enclosed a ten-rouble note between the pages, clearly
assuming that it would ensure high marks.</p>

<p>At the close of his first year he saw in a literary
paper that Sir Henry Jergwin, the celebrated English
critic, editor, and man of letters, had died suddenly in
London whilst replying to a toast at the annual dinner of a
literary society.</p>

<p>Hamarin pressed him to stay another year at Rostov,
and he did so chiefly because he could not think of
anything else to do or anywhere else to go. It was during
this second year that he began to gain insight into the
close network of revolutionary activity that was spread
throughout the entire country. Even bourgeois Rostov
had its secret clubs and government spies, and there
seemed to be an ever-widening gulf between the wealthier
classes and the workpeople. When occasionally he went
into better-class houses to give private English lessons
he was often amazed at the way servants were bullied by
everyone, from the master of the house even down to the
five-year-old baby who had already learned whom he might
kick and scratch with impunity. One youth, the son of a
wealthy mill-owner, went out of his way to explain. "You
see, they're all thieves and rogues. We know it, and they
know we know it. They steal everything they can&mdash;they
have no loyalty&mdash;they lie to us a dozen times a day
as a matter of course. Why should we treat them any better
than the scum that they are? It's their fault as much as
ours."</p>

<p>A.J. became quite friendly with this youth, who had
travelled in Germany and France, and looked at affairs from
a somewhat wider standpoint than the usual Rostov citizen.
His name was Sergey Vilensky, and he was destined for
the army. He had no illusions about the country or its
people. "You simply have to treat them like that," he often
said. "It's the only basis on which life becomes at all
possible."</p>

<p>"And yet," A.J. answered, "I have met some of the most
charming folk among the common people&mdash;ignorant
soldiers whom I would certainly have trusted with my
life."</p>

<p>"A good job you didn't. They may have been
charming&mdash;quite likely&mdash;but they were rogues,
I'll wager, and would probably have killed you for a small
bribe. Our people have no morals&mdash;only a sort of good
humour that impresses foreigners."</p>

<p>A.J. went to the Vilenskys' twice a week to teach
English to the two girls, aged fifteen and seventeen
respectively. Neither learned anything, except in the
dullest and least intelligent way; neither considered that
life held any possible future except a successful marriage.
The older girl would have flirted with him if he had been
inclined for the diversion. The younger girl was the
prettier, but had a ferocious temper. She boasted that she
had once maimed for life a man who had come to the house
to polish the floors. It was his custom to take off one of
his shoes and tie a polishing cloth round his stockinged
foot so that he could polish without stooping. The girl,
then aged eleven, had flown into a temper because he had
accidentally disturbed some toy of hers; she had seized
a heavy silver samovar and dropped it on to his foot,
breaking several bones. "And it wasn't at all a bad thing
for him," she told A.J., "because father pays him something
every now and then and he doesn't have to polish the floors
for it."</p>

<p>A.J. sometimes went to parties at the Vilenskys'
house; monsieur and madame (as they liked to be called)
were hospitable, and refrained from treating him as they
would have done a native teacher. Once he met Vilensky's
brother, who was a publisher in Petersburg. Anton
Vilensky, well known to all the Russian reading public,
took considerable interest in the young Englishman and,
after an hour's conversation, offered him a post in his own
Petersburg office. "You are far too good a scholar to be
teaching in a little place like Rostov," he said. The post
offered was that of English translator and proof-reader,
and the salary double that which Hamarin paid. A.J.
mentioned his contract at the school, but Vilensky said:
"Oh, never mind that&mdash;I'll deal with Hamarin," and he
did, though A.J. could only guess how.</p>

<p>So A.J. left Rostov and went to Petersburg. That was
in 1907, when he was twenty-seven. The change from the
provincial atmosphere to the liveliness and culture of
the capital was immeasurably welcome to him. The gaiety
of the theatres and cafés, the fine shops on the Nevsky,
the splendour of the Cathedral and of the Winter Palace,
all pleased the eye of the impressionable youth whose
job left him leisure for thinking and observing. He had
been to Petersburg before, but to see it as a visitor had
been vastly different from living in it. His rooms were
across the river in the Viborg district; from his windows
he could see, at sunset, the Gulf of Finland bathed in
saffron splendour, and there was something of everlasting
melancholy in that pageant of sky and water ushering in
the silver northern night. Before he had been long in
Petersburg he received other impressions&mdash;the glitter
of Cossack bayonets and scarlet imperial uniforms, and in
the darker background, the huge scowling mass of misery
and corruption through which revolutionary currents ran
like threads of doom. It was fascinating to watch those
ever-changing scenes of barbaric magnificence and sordid
degradation&mdash;to cheer the imperial sleigh as it swept
over the snow-bound boulevards, to gaze on the weekly
batches of manacled prisoners marching to the railway
station en route for the Ural convict-mines, to see the
crowds of wild-eyed strikers surging around the mills of
the new industrialism. His work at Vilensky's office was
easy; he had to superintend the translation of English
works into Russian and to give them final proof-reading. It
was also expected that he should make suggestions for new
translations, and it was over this branch of his work that,
after a successful and enjoyable year, he came to sudden
grief. At his recommendation a certain English novel had
been translated, printed, published, and sent to the shops;
it was selling quite well when all at once the police
authorities detected or pretended to detect in it some
thinly-veiled allusions to the private life of the Emperor.
Vilensky was thus put in a most awkward position, since
he supplied text-books to the government schools and had a
strictly orthodox reputation to keep up; his only chance of
escaping business ruin and perhaps personal imprisonment
was by laying the entire blame on his subordinate. As he
told A.J. quite frankly: "It just can't be helped. They
won't do anything to you, as you're English. If you were
Russian they'd probably send you to Siberia&mdash;as it is,
they can only cancel your permit."</p>

<p>So Vilensky made a great show of dismissing with
ignominy a subordinate who had disgracefully let him down,
and managed, by such strategy, to escape with a severe
warning so far as he himself was concerned. As for A.J., he
received a polite note from police headquarters informing
him that he must leave Russia within a week.</p>

<p>He felt this as a rather considerable blow, for in the
first place he was sorry to have brought so much trouble
on Vilensky, whom he had grown to like; and besides, he
had his own problems to solve. He did not wish to return
to England. He had no idea of anything that he could do if
he did return; he had no specialist qualifications except
a knowledge of Russian, which would be hardly as useful
in London as was a knowledge of English in Petersburg.
Journalism was hopeless; he could realise now, over the
perspective of several years, what a complete failure he
had been in Fleet Street. Teaching, of which he had had
some experience, would be impossible in any good English
school owing to his poor degree, while as for the other
professions, he neither inclined towards them nor had any
hope that they would incline towards him.</p>

<p>Beyond even this he had grown to like Petersburg. He
had lived in it now for over a year, had seen it in all
its climatic moods; and now it was April again and the
sledge-roads on the frozen Neva would soon be closing for
the thaw. The prospect of summer had been alluring to him
more than he had realised; he had been looking forward
to many a swim at Peterhof and many an excursion into
the flower-decked woods that fringed the city on so many
sides.</p>

<p>His permitted week expired on Easter Tuesday and on
Easter Eve he strolled rather sadly along the Nevsky and
watched the quaint and fascinating ceremonial. Thousands
of poor work-people had brought their Easter suppers to be
blest, and the priests were walking quickly amongst the
crowds sprinkling the holy water out of large buckets.
The food was set out on glistening white napkins on which
stood also lighted tapers, and there was a fairy-like
charm in that panorama of flickering lights, vestmented
priests, and rapt, upturned faces. A.J. had seen it all
the previous year, but it held additional poignancy now
that it seemed almost the last impression he would have
of the city. He was observing it with rather more than a
sight-seer's interest when a well-dressed man in expensive
furs, who happened to be pushed against him by the pressure
of the crowd, made some polite remark about the beauty of
the scene. A.J. answered appropriately and conversation
followed. The man was middle-aged and from his speech a
person of culture. He was not, A.J. judged, an Orthodox
believer, but he showed a keen sympathy and understanding
of the religious motive, and was obviously as fascinated by
the spectacle as A.J. himself.</p>

<p>The two, indeed, soon found that they had a great
many common ideas and interests, and talked for perhaps
a quarter of an hour before the stranger said: "Excuse
my curiosity, but I'm just wondering if you're Russian.
It isn't the accent that betrays you&mdash;don't think
that&mdash;merely a way of looking at things that one
doesn't often find in this country. At a venture I should
guess you French."</p>

<p>"You'd be wrong," answered A.J., smiling. "I'm
English."</p>

<p>"Are you, by Jove?" responded the other, dropping the
Russian language with sudden fervour. "That's odd, because
so am I. My name's Stanfield."</p>

<p>"Mine's Fothergill."</p>

<p>They talked now with even greater relish, and though
Stanfield did not say who he was, A.J. surmised that he had
some connection with the British Embassy. They, discussed
all kinds of things during the whole four-mile walk down
the Nevsky and back, after which Stanfield said: "Did you
ever go to midnight Mass at St. Isaac's?" A.J. shook his
head, and the other continued: "You ought to&mdash;it's
really worth seeing. If you've nothing else on this evening
we might go together."</p>

<p>They did, and the experience was one that A.J. was
sure he would never forget. They arrived at the church
about eleven, when the building was already thronged
and in almost total darkness. Under the dome stood a
catafalque on which lay an open coffin containing a
painted representation of the dead Christ. Thousands of
unlighted candles marked the form of the vast interior, and
Stanfield explained that they were all linked with threads
of gun-cotton. There was no light anywhere save from a few
tall candles round the bier.</p>

<p>Soon the members of the diplomatic corps arrived,
gorgeously uniformed and decorated, and took up their
allotted positions, while black-robed priests began the
mournful singing of the Office for the Dead. Then followed
an elaborate ritual in which the priests pretended
to search in vain for the Body. Despite its touch of
theatricalism the miming was deeply impressive. Then
sharply, on the first stroke of midnight, the marvellous
climax arrived; the chief priest cried loudly&mdash;'Christ
is risen!' while the gun-cotton, being fired, touched into
gradual flame the thousands of candles. Simultaneously
cannon crashed out from the neighbouring fortress, and the
choir, led by the clergy (no longer in black but in their
richest cloth of gold), broke out into the triumphant
cadences of the Easter Hymn. The sudden transference
from gloom to dazzling brilliance and from silence to
deafening jubilation stirred emotions that were almost
breath-taking.</p>

<p>Afterwards, amidst the chorus of Easter salutations the
two men sauntered by the banks of the river. A.J. said how
glad he was to have seen such a spectacle, and Stanfield
answered: "Yes, it's one of the things I never miss if
I happen to be here. I've seen it now at least a dozen
times, yet it's always fresh, and never fails to give me a
thrill."</p>

<p>Something then impelled A.J. to say: "I'm particularly
glad to have seen it, because I don't suppose I'll ever
have the chance again."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed? You're only on a visit? You spoke Russian
so well I imagined you lived here."</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;or rather I have done for some
time&mdash;but I'm going away&mdash;very soon, I'm
afraid&mdash;for good."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>A.J. was not a person to confide easily, but the
difficulty of his problem, combined with Stanfield's
sympathetic attitude and the emotional mood in which the
Cathedral ceremony had left them both, made it easy for him
to hint that the circumstances of his leaving Petersburg
were not of the happiest. Stanfield was immediately
interested, and within half an hour (it was by that time
nearly two in the morning) most of A.J.'s position had
been explained and explored. Once the process began it
was difficult to stop, and in the end A.J. found himself
confessing even the ridiculous suffragette episode which
had been the immediate cause of his departure from England
four years before. Stanfield was amused at that. "So I
gather," he summarised at last, "that you're in the rather
awkward position of having to leave this country and of
having no other country that you particularly want to go
to?"</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>"You definitely don't want to return to England?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather go anywhere else."</p>

<p>"But you must have friends there&mdash;a few, at any
rate. Four years isn't such a tremendous interval."</p>

<p>"I know. That's why I'd rather go anywhere else."</p>

<p>"Don't you think you're taking the suffragette affair
rather too seriously? After all, most people will have
forgotten it by now, and in any case it wasn't anything
particularly disgraceful."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;there are other reasons&mdash;much
more important ones. I&mdash;I don't want to go back to
England." He gave Stanfield a glance which decided the
latter against any further questioning in that direction.
"Besides, even if I <i>were</i> to go back there, what could I
do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, do I? What <i>are</i> your
accomplishments?"</p>

<p>A.J. smiled. "Very few, and all of them extremely
unmarketable. I can speak Russian, that's about all. Oh
yes, and I can swim and fence, and I'm a bit of a geologist
in my spare time. It doesn't really sound the sort of thing
to impress an employment agency, does it?"</p>

<p>"Do you fancy an outdoor life?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind, provided it isn't just merely physical
work. It may sound conceited, but I rather want something
where I have to use a small amount of brains. Yet I
wouldn't care for a job at a desk all the time. I'm afraid
I'm talking as though I were likely to be given any choice
in the matter."</p>

<p>"What about danger&mdash;personal danger? Would that be
a disadvantage?"</p>

<p>"I'd hate the army, if that's what you mean."</p>

<p>"No, that isn't what I mean. I meant some kind of job
where you had occasionally to take risks&mdash;pretty
big risks, in their way&mdash;playing for high
stakes&mdash;<i>that</i> sort of thing."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid your description doesn't help me to imagine
such a job, but as a guess I should say it would suit me
very well."</p>

<p>Stanfield laughed. "I can't be more explicit. How about
the money?"</p>

<p>"Oh well, I'd like enough to live on and a little bit
more. But isn't it rather absurd to be talking in this
way, since I shall be very lucky to get any sort of job at
all?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, it's just possible&mdash;yes, it is
just possible that I might be able to put you in the way
of the kind of job you say you would like. And here in
Petersburg, too."</p>

<p>"You forget that I have to leave. My police permit
expires on Tuesday."</p>

<p>"No, I don't forget that at all. I am remembering it
most carefully."</p>

<p>"I don't follow."</p>

<p>"Let me explain. But first, I must pledge you to the
strictest secrecy. Whether or not you and I can come to
terms, you must give me that assurance."</p>

<p>"I do, of course."</p>

<p>"Good. Then listen."</p>

<p>Briefly, Stanfield's suggestion was that A.J. should
become attached to the British Secret Service. That sounded
simple enough, but an examination of all that it implied
revealed a network of complication and detail. Stanfield,
relying on A.J.'s promise of secrecy, was as frank as
he needed to be, but no more so. British diplomacy, he
explained, had its own reasons for wishing to know the
precise strength and significance of the revolutionary
movement in Russia. It was impossible to obtain reliable
information from official channels, whether British or
Russian; the only sources were devious and underground.
"Supposing, for instance, you decided to help us, you would
have to join one of the revolutionary societies, identify
yourself with the cause, gain the confidence of its
leaders, and judge for yourself how much the whole thing
counts. I think you'll agree with me that such a job calls
for brains and might well involve considerable personal
risks."</p>

<p>"I should be a spy, in fact?"</p>

<p>"In a way, yes, but you would not be betraying anybody.
You would merely make your confidential reports to our
headquarters&mdash;you would not be working either for or
against the revolutionaries themselves. We take no sides,
of course&mdash;we merely want to know what is really
happening."</p>

<p>"I see. And the danger would be that the revolutionaries
would find me out and think I was betraying them to the
Russian police?"</p>

<p>"The danger, my friend, would be twofold, and I'm not
going to try to minimise it in the least. There would be,
of course, the danger you mention, but there would be the
even greater danger that the Russian police would take you
for a genuine revolutionary and deal with you accordingly.
And you know what 'accordingly' means."</p>

<p>"But in that case I suppose I should have to tell them
the real truth?"</p>

<p>"Not at all&mdash;that is just what you would not
have to do. You would have to keep up your pretence and
accept whatever punishment they gave you. If you <i>did</i>
tell them the truth, the British authorities would merely
arch their eyebrows with great loftiness and disown you. I
want you to be quite clear about that. We should, in the
beginning, provide you with passport and papers proving
you to be a Russian subject, and after that, if anything
ever went wrong, you would have to become that Russian
subject&mdash;completely. Do you see? We could not risk
trouble with the Russian Government by having anything to
do with you."</p>

<p>"It seems rather a one-sided arrangement."</p>

<p>"It is, as I can say from experience, having worked
under it for the best part of my life. On the other
hand, it has certain advantages which probably appeal to
people like you and me rather more than to most others.
It is interesting, adventurous, and quite well paid. It
is also emphatically a job for the Cat that Walks by
Itself&mdash;you remember Kipling's story?&mdash;and I
should imagine both of us are that type of animal."</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>"Mind you, I don't want to persuade you at all&mdash;and
I do want you to have time to think the whole thing over
very carefully before coming to a decision. Unless, of
course, you feel that you may as well say 'No' straight
away?"</p>

<p>A.J. shook his head. "I'll think it over, as you
suggest."</p>

<p>"Then we'd better meet again to-morrow." He gave A.J. an
address, and the arrangement was made. A.J. did not sleep
well that night. When he tried to look at the future quite
coolly, when he asked himself whether his ambition really
was to be a Secret Service spy in a Russian revolutionary
club, the answer was neither yes nor no, but a mere gasp of
incredulity. It was almost impossible to realise that such
an extraordinary doorway had suddenly opened into his life.
It was not impossible, however, to grasp the fact that if
he did not accept Stanfield's offer he would have to leave
Russia in two days' time, with very poor and uncertain
prospects.</p>

<p>He called in the morning at the address Stanfield had
given him&mdash;a well-furnished apartment in one of the
better-class districts. Stanfield was there, together
with another man, introduced as Forrester. "Well," began
Stanfield, "have you made up your mind?"</p>

<p>A.J. answered, with a wry smile: "I don't feel in the
least like jumping at the job, but I'm aware that I must
either take it or leave Russia."</p>

<p>"And you're as keen as all that on not leaving
Russia?"</p>

<p>"I rather think I am."</p>

<p>"That means you'll take on the job."</p>

<p>"I suppose it does."</p>

<p>Here Forrester intervened with: "I suppose Stanfield
gave you details of what you'd have to do?"</p>

<p>"More or less&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"You'd have to be the young intellectual type&mdash;your
accent and manner would pass well enough, I daresay. But
what about enthusiasm for the cause&mdash;can you act?" He
added, slyly: "Or perhaps you would not need to act very
much, eh?"</p>

<p>"As an Englishman in Russia," answered A.J. cautiously,
"I have always felt that I ought to avoid taking sides in
Russian politics. You can judge from that, then, how much I
should have to act."</p>

<p>Forrester nodded. "Good, my friend&mdash;a wise and
admirable reply. I should think he would do, wouldn't you,
Stanfield?"</p>

<p>The latter said: "I thought so all along. Still, we
mustn't persuade him. It's risky work and he knows some of
the more unpleasant possibilities. It's emphatically a game
of heads somebody else wins and tails he loses."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," Forrester agreed. "Most decidedly so. The
pay, by the way, works out at about fifty pounds a month,
besides expenses and an occasional bonus."</p>

<p>"That sounds attractive," said A.J.</p>

<p>"<i>Attractive?</i>" Forrester turned again to Stanfield.
"Did you hear that? He says the pay's attractive! You know
Stanfield, it's the money that most people go for in,
this job, yet I really do believe our friend here is an
exception! He only admits that the money's attractive!"
With a smile, he swung round to A.J. "I'm rather curious to
know what it is that weighs most with you in this business.
Is it adventure?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered A.J. "I really don't know at
all."</p>

<p>So they had to leave that engrossing problem and get
down to definite talk about details. That definite talk
lasted several hours, after which A.J. was offered lunch.
Then, during the afternoon, the talk was resumed. It was
all rather complicated. He was to be given a Russian
passport (forged, of course, though the ugly word was not
emphasised) establishing him to be one Pyotr Vasilevich
Uranov, a student. He must secure rooms under that name in
a part of the city where he was not known; he must pose as
a young man of small private means occupied in literary
work of some kind. To assist the disguise he must cultivate
a short beard and moustache. Then he must frequent a
certain bookshop (its address would be given him) where
revolutionaries were known to foregather, and must
cautiously make known his sympathies so that he would be
invited to join a society. Once in the society, it would be
his task to get to know all he could concerning its aims,
personnel, and the sources from which it obtained funds;
such information he would transmit at intervals to an agent
in Petersburg whose constantly changing address would be
given him from time to time. It would not be expected,
nor would it even be desirable, that he should take any
prominent or active part in the revolutionary movement; he
must avoid, therefore, being elected to any position of
authority. "We don't want you chosen to throw bombs at the
Emperor," said Forrester, "but supposing anyone else throws
them, then we do want to know who he is, who's behind him,
and all that sort of thing. Get the idea?"</p>

<p>A.J. got the idea, and left the two men towards evening,
after Stanfield had taken his photograph with an ordinary
camera. That night and much of the next day he spent in
packing. He had told the porter and the woman who looked
after his room that he might be leaving very soon, so they
were not surprised by his preparations for departure. In
the evening, following instructions, he gave the two of
them handsome tips, said good-bye, and drove to the Warsaw
station. There he left his bags in the luggage office,
giving his proper name (which was, in fact, on all the
luggage labels as well). After sauntering about the station
for a short time he left it and walked to Stanfield's
address. There he handed over to Forrester his English
passport and luggage tickets. He rather expected to see
Forrester burn the passport, but the latter merely put it
in his pocket and soon afterwards left the house. Stanfield
smiled. "Forrester's a thorough fellow," he commented. "He
doesn't intend to have the Russian police wondering what's
happened to you. To-night, my friend, though it may startle
you to know it, Mr. A.J. Fothergill will leave Russia. He
will collect his luggage at the Warsaw station, he will
board the night express for Germany, his passport will be
stamped in the usual way at Wierjbolovo and Eydkuhnen, but
in Berlin, curiously enough if anyone bothered to make
enquiries, all trace of him would be lost. How fortunate
that your height and features are reasonably normal and
that passport photographs are always so dreadfully bad!"</p>

<p>After an hour or so Forrester returned and informed
A.J. that he was to stay with them in their apartment for
a fortnight at least, and that during that time he must
consider himself a prisoner. The rather amusing object of
the interval was to give time for his beard and moustache
to grow. A.J. rather enjoyed the fortnight, for both
Forrester and Stanfield were excellent company, and there
was a large library of books for him to dip into. The two
men came in and went out at all kinds of odd hours, and had
their needs attended to by a queer-looking man-servant who
was evidently trustworthy, since they spoke freely enough
in front of him.</p>

<p>At the end of the fortnight, by which time A.J.'s face
had begun to give him a remarkably different appearance,
Forrester again photographed him, and a few days later
handed him his new passport and papers of identity. It
gave him a shock, at first, to see himself so confidently
described as 'Pyotr Vasilevich Uranov,' born at such and
such a place and on such and such a date. "You must get
used to thinking of yourself by that name," Forrester
told him. "And you must also make it your business to
know something about your own past life. Your parents,
of course, are both dead. You have just a little money
of your own&mdash;enough to save you from having to work
for a living you are a studious, well-educated person, at
present engaged in writing a book about&mdash;what shall we
say?&mdash;something, perhaps, with a slightly subversive
flavour&mdash;political economy, perhaps, or moral
philosophy. Oh, by the way, you may permit yourself to know
a little French and German&mdash;as much, in fact, as you
<i>do</i> know. But not a word of English. Remember that most of
all."</p>

<p>The next morning A.J. was made to change into a
completely different outfit of clothes. He was also given
three hundred roubles in cash, a small trunk-key, and
a luggage ticket issued at the Moscow station. After
breakfast he said good-bye to Forrester and Stanfield,
walked from their apartment to the station, presented his
ticket, received in exchange a large portmanteau, and drove
in a cab to an address Forrester had given him. It was a
block of middle-class apartments on the southern fringe
of the city. There chanced (or was it chance?) to be an
apartment vacant; he interviewed the porter, came to terms,
produced his papers for registration, and took up his abode
in a comfortable set of rooms on the third floor. There he
unlocked the portmanteau, and found it contained clothes,
a few Russian books, a brass samovar, and several boxes of
a popular brand of Russian cigarettes. These miscellaneous
and well-chosen contents rather amused him.</p>

<p>Thus he began life under the new name. He was startled,
after a few days, to find how easy it was to assume a
fresh identity; he conscientiously tried to forget all
about Ainsley Jergwin Fothergill and to remember only
Pyotr Vasilevich Uranov, and soon the transference came to
require surprisingly little effort. Forrester had cautioned
him not to be in any great hurry to begin his real work,
so at first he merely made small purchases at the bookshop
whose address he had been given, without attempting to
get to know anyone. Gradually, however, the youthful,
studious-looking fellow who bought text-books on economic
history (that was the subject finally fixed on) attracted
the attention of the bookseller, a small swarthy Jew of
considerable charm and culture. His name was Axelstein.
A.J. had all along decided that, if possible, he would
allow the first move to be made by the other side, and he
was pleased when, one afternoon during the slack hours of
business, Axelstein began a conversation with him. Both
men were exceedingly cautious and only after a longish
talk permitted it to be surmised that they were neither of
them passionate supporters of the Government. Subsequent
talks made the matter less vague, and in the end it all
happened much as Forrester had foreshadowed&mdash;A.J. was
introduced to several other frequenters of the shop, and it
was tacitly assumed that he was a most promising recruit to
the movement.</p>

<p>A few days later he was admitted to a club to which
Axelstein and many of his customers belonged. It met in
an underground beer-hall near the Finland station. Over a
hundred men and women crowded themselves into the small,
unventilated room, whose atmosphere was soon thick with
the mingled fumes of beer, <i>makhorka</i> tobacco, and human
bodies. Some of the men were factory-workers with hands and
clothes still greasy from the machines. Others belonged
to the bourgeois and semi-intelligentsia&mdash;clerks in
government offices, school teachers, book-keepers, and so
on. A few others were university students. Of the women,
some were factory-workers, some stenographers, but most
were just the wives of the men.</p>

<p>A.J. allowed himself to make several friends in
that underground beer-hall, and the reality of its
companionship together with the secrecy and danger of the
meeting, made a considerable impression on him. Often news
was received that one or another member had been arrested
and imprisoned without trial. Police spies were everywhere;
there was even the possibility, known to all, that some
of the members might themselves be spies or <i>agents
provocateurs</i>. Caution was the universal and necessary
watchword, and at any moment during their sessions members
were ready to transform themselves into a haphazard
and harmless group of beer-drinking and card-playing
roisterers.</p>

<p>It was only by degrees that A.J. came to realise the
immensity of the tide that was flowing towards revolution.
That club was only one of hundreds in Petersburg alone,
and Petersburg was only one of scores of Russian cities in
which such clubs existed. The movement was like a great
subterranean octopus stirring ever more restlessly beneath
the foundations of imperial government. An arm cut off here
or there had absolutely no effect; if a hundred men were
deported to Siberia a hundred others were ready to step
instantly into the vacant places. Everything was carefully
and skilfully organised, and there seemed to be no lack of
money. The Government always declared that it came from the
Japanese, but Axelstein hinted that most of it derived from
big Jewish banking and industrial interests.</p>

<p>A.J. became rather friendly with an eighteen-year-old
university student named Maronin. He was fair-haired,
large-eyed, and delicate-looking, with thin, artistic hands
(he was a fine pianist) and slender nostrils; his father
had been a lawyer in Kiev. The boy did no real work at
the university and had no particular profession in view;
he lived every moment for the revolution he believed to
be coming. A.J. found that this intense and passionate
attitude occasioned no surprise amongst the others, though,
of course, it was hardly typical.</p>

<p>Young Aleksey Maronin interested A.J. a great deal. He
was such a kindly, jolly, amusing boy&mdash;in England
A.J. could have imagined him a popular member of the
sixth-form. In Russia, however, he was already a man, and
with more than an average man's responsibilities, since
he had volunteered for any task, however dangerous, that
the revolutionary organisers would allot him. Axelstein
explained that this probably meant that he would be chosen
for the next 'decisive action' whenever that should
take place. "He is just the type," Axelstein explained
calmly. "Throwing a bomb accurately when you know that
the next moment you will be torn to pieces requires a
certain quality of nerve which, as a rule, only youngsters
possess."</p>

<p>Regularly every week A.J. transmitted his secret
reports and received his regular payments by a routine so
complicated and devious that it seemed to preclude all
possibility of discovery. He found his work extremely
interesting, and his new companions so friendly and
agreeable, on the whole, that he was especially glad that
his spying activities were not directed against them.
He was well satisfied to remain personally impartial,
observing with increasing interest both sides of the
worsening situation.</p>

<p>One afternoon he was walking with Maronin through a
factory district during a lock-out; crowds of factory
workers&mdash;men, women, and girls&mdash;were strolling
or loitering about quite peaceably. Suddenly, with loud
shouts and the clatter of hoofs, a troop of Cossacks
swept round the street-corner, their lithe bodies swaying
rhythmically from side to side as they laid about them with
their short, leaden-tipped whips. The crowd screamed and
stampeded for safety, but most were hemmed in between the
Cossacks and the closed factory-gates. A.J. and Maronin
pressed themselves against the wall and trusted to luck;
several horsemen flashed past; whips cracked and there were
terrifying screams; then all was over, almost as sharply
as it had begun. A girl standing next to Maronin had been
struck; the whip had laid open her cheek from lip to ear.
A.J. and Maronin helped to carry her into a neighbouring
shop, which was already full of bleeding victims. Maronin
said: "My mother was blinded like that&mdash;by a Cossack
whip,"&mdash;and A.J. suddenly felt as he had done years
before when he had decided to fight Smalljohn's system
at Barrowhurst, and when he had seen the policeman in
Trafalgar Square twisting the suffragette's arm&mdash;only
a thousand times more intensely.</p>

<p>Throughout the summer he went on making his reports,
attending meetings, arguing with Axelstein, and cultivating
friendship with the boy Aleksey. There was something very
pure and winsome about the latter&mdash;the power of his
single burning ideal gave him an air of otherworldliness,
even in his most natural and boyish moments. His hatred of
the entire governmental system was terrible in its sheer
simplicity; it was the system he was pledged against; mere
individuals, so far as they were obeying orders, roused
in him only friendliness and pity. The Cossack guards who
had slashed the crowd with their whips were to him as much
victims as the crowd itself, and even the Emperor, he was
ready to admit, was probably a quite harmless and decent
fellow personally. The real enemy was the framework of
society from top to bottom, and in attacking that enemy,
it might and probably would happen that the innocent
would have to suffer. Thus he justified assassinations of
prominent officials; as human beings they were guiltless
and to be pitied, but as cogs in the detested machine there
could be no mercy for them.</p>

<p>About midnight one October evening A.J. was reading in
his sitting-room and thinking of going to bed when the
porter tapped at his door with the message that a young man
wished to see him. Such late visits were against police
regulations, but the chance of a good tip had doubtless
weighed more powerfully in the balance. A.J. nodded, and
the porter immediately ushered in Maronin, who had been
standing behind him in the shadow of the landing.</p>

<p>As soon as the door had closed and the two were alone
together A.J. could see that something was wrong. The
boy's face was milky pale and his eyes stared fixedly; he
was also holding his hand against his chest in a rather
peculiar way. "What on earth's the matter?" A.J. enquired,
and for answer Aleksey could do nothing but remove his hand
and allow a sudden stream of blood to spurt out and stain
the carpet.</p>

<p>A.J., in astonished alarm, helped him into the bedroom
and laid him on the bed, discovering then that he had been
shot in the chest and was still bleeding profusely. The
boy did not speak at first; he seemed to have no strength
to do anything but smile. When, however, A.J. had tended
him a little and had given him brandy, he began to stammer
out what had happened. He had, it seemed, fulfilled a
secret task given him by revolutionary headquarters. He
had shot Danilov, Minister of the Interior. He had done
it by seeking an interview and firing point-blank across
the minister's own study-table. Danilov, however, had
been quick enough to draw a revolver and fire back at his
assailant as the latter escaped through a window. A ladder
had been placed in readiness by an accomplice, and Aleksey
had been descending by it when Danilov's bullet had struck
him in the chest. He had hurried down, unheeding, and had
mingled&mdash;successfully, he believed&mdash;with the
crowds leaving a theatre. He had been in great pain by
then, and knew that he dare not let himself be taken to a
hospital because in such a place his wound would instantly
betray him. The only plan he had been able to think of
had been a flight to his friend's apartment, and though
that was over a mile from Danilov's house, he had walked
there, despite his agony, and even in the porter's office
had managed to make his request with-out seeming to arouse
suspicion. Now, in his friend's bedroom, he could only gasp
out his story and plead not to be turned away.</p>

<p>There was no question of that, A.J. assured him; no
question of that. "You shall stay here, Aleksey, till you
are well again, but I must go out and find a doctor&mdash;I
have done all I can myself, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>The boy shook his head. "No, no, you can't get a
doctor&mdash;he'll ask questions&mdash;it's impossible.
But I have a friend&mdash;a medical student&mdash;I will
give you his address&mdash;to-morrow you shall fetch him to
me&mdash;he will take out the bullet&mdash;and say
nothing..."</p>

<p>"Tell me where he lives and I will fetch him now."</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;the police would stop you&mdash;they will
be all everywhere to-night&mdash;because of Danilov." He
added: "I am sorry to be such a bother to you&mdash;I wish
I could have thought of some other way. If only I had taken
better aim I might have killed him instantly."</p>

<p>"Don't talk," A.J. commanded, huskily. "Try to be
quiet&mdash;then in the morning I will fetch your
friend."</p>

<p>"Yes. I shall be all right when the bullet is taken
out."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes. Don't talk any more."</p>

<p>He held the boy in his arms, that boy with the face of
an angel, that boy who had just shot a government minister
in cold blood; he held him in his arms until past one in
the morning, and then, very quietly and apparently with a
gradual diminution of pain, the end came.</p>

<p>Till that moment A.J. had felt nothing but, pity for
his friend; but afterwards he began to realise that he
was himself in an extraordinarily difficult and dangerous
situation. How could he explain the death of the boy that
night in his apartment? What story could he invent that
would not connect himself with the attack on Danilov? The
deep red stain in the midst of his sitting-room carpet
faced him as a dreadful reminder of his problems. He had
no time to solve them, even tentatively, for less than a
quarter of an hour after the boy's death he heard a loud
commotion in the street outside and a few seconds later a
vehement banging on the door of the porter's office. Next
came heavy footsteps up the stairs and a sudden pummeling
on his own door. He went to open it and saw a group of
police officers standing outside, with the porter in
custody.</p>

<p>"We understand that a young man visited you a short time
ago," began one of the officers, with curt precision.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered A.J.</p>

<p>"Is he here now?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"We must have a word with him."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that will be impossible. He is dead."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;then, if you will permit us to see the
body."</p>

<p>"Certainly. In there."</p>

<p>He pointed to the bedroom, but did not follow them. One
of the officers stayed behind in the sitting-room. After a
few moments the others returned and their leader resumed
his questioning. "Now, sir," he said, facing A.J. rather
sternly, "perhaps you will be good enough to explain all
this."</p>

<p>A.J. replied, as calmly as he could: "I will explain all
I can, which I am afraid isn't very much. I was sitting
here just over an hour ago, about to go to bed, when the
young man was brought up to see me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The porter brought him up?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Continue."</p>

<p>"I invited him to come in, and as he looked ill, I
asked him what was the matter. Besides, of course, it was
peculiar his wanting to see me at such a late hour."</p>

<p>"Very peculiar indeed. You must have been a very
intimate friend of his."</p>

<p>"Hardly that, as a matter of fact. He used to drop and
see me now and again, that was all."</p>

<p>"Continue with the story."</p>

<p>"Well, as I was saying, I asked him what was the
matter, but he didn't answer. He was holding his hand to
his chest&mdash;like this." A.J. imitated the position.
"Then he suddenly took his hand away and the result
was&mdash;that." He pointed to the stain on the carpet.
"Then he collapsed and I took him into my bedroom. I
discovered that he had been shot, but I could not get him
to explain anything at all about how it had happened. I
made him as comfortable as I could and was just about to
send for a doctor when he died. That's all, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"You say he told you nothing of what had happened to
him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all."</p>

<p>"And you could make no guess?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely none&mdash;it seemed a complete mystery to
me during the very short time I had for thinking about
it."</p>

<p>"You know who the young man is?"</p>

<p>"I know his name. He is Aleksey Maronin."</p>

<p>"And your name?"</p>

<p>"Pyotr Vasilevich Uranov."</p>

<p>"How did you come to know Maronin?"</p>

<p>"We met in connection with some work I am engaged upon.
I am writing a book of history and Maronin was interested
in the same period. We used to meet occasionally for an
exchange of ideas."</p>

<p>"What was he by profession?"</p>

<p>"A student, I rather imagined. He was always very
reserved about himself and his affairs."</p>

<p>"Were you surprised to see him an hour ago when he came
here?"</p>

<p>"I certainly was."</p>

<p>"You know it is against police rules for strangers to be
admitted at that hour?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Had the porter ever admitted visitors to your apartment
at such a time before?"</p>

<p>A.J., from the porter's woebegone appearance, guessed
that he had already made the fullest and most abject
confession, so he replied: "Yes, he had&mdash;but not very
often."</p>

<p>"Had he ever admitted Maronin before at such a late
hour?"</p>

<p>"I believe so&mdash;once."</p>

<p>"Why, then, were you surprised to see him when he came
to-night?"</p>

<p>A.J. answered, with an effort of casualness: "Because on
that last occasion when he paid me a call after permitted
hours I gave the boy such a scolding for breaking rules and
leading me into possible trouble, that I felt quite sure he
had learned a lesson and would not do so again."</p>

<p>"I see... And you still say that you have not the
slightest idea how Maronin met with his injury?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest."</p>

<p>"May we examine your passport?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>He produced it and handed it over. While it was being
closely inspected two police officers carried the boy's
body to a waiting ambulance below. Finally the leading
officer handed the passport back to A.J. with the words:
"That will be all for the present, but we may wish to
question you again." The police then departed, but A.J.
was under no illusion that danger had departed with them.
When he looked out of his sitting-room window he could see
and hear the march of a patient watcher on the pavement
below.</p>

<p>He drank some brandy to steady his nerves and spent the
rest of the night in his easiest armchair. He did not care
to enter the bedroom. Now that the police had left him,
personal apprehensions were again overshadowed by grief.</p>

<p>He had fallen into a troubled doze when he was awakened
by the sound of scuffling on the landing outside,
punctuated by shrill screams from the woman who usually
came in the mornings to clear up his room and prepare
breakfast. She was evidently being compelled to give up
her keys, and a moment later the door was unlocked and two
police guards strode into the room. They were of a very
different type from those of the previous visit. Huge,
shaggy fellows, blustering in manner and brutal in method,
A.J. recognised their class from so many stories he had
heard in that underground beer-hall. "You are to come with
us immediately," one of them ordered gruffly. "Take any
extra clothes and personal articles that you can put into a
small parcel." A.J. felt a sharp stab of panic; the routine
was dreadfully familiar. "By whose orders?" he asked,
feeling that a show of truculence might have some effect
with men who were obviously uneducated; but the only reply
was a surly: "You'll find that out in good time."</p>

<p>The men were armed with big revolvers, apart from which
they were of such physique that resistance was out of the
question. A.J. gathered together a few possessions and
accompanied his two escorts to a pair-horse van waiting
at the kerbside. This they bade him enter, one of them
getting inside with him, while the other took the reins.
The inside was almost pitch dark. After a noisy rattling
drive of over half an hour the doors were opened and A.J.
was ushered quickly into a building whose exterior he had
no time to recognise. The two guards led him into a large
bleak room unfurnished except for a desk and a few chairs.
A heavily-built and dissipated-looking man sat at the
desk twirling his moustache. When A.J. was brought in the
man put on a pair of steel-rimmed spectacles and stared
fiercely.</p>

<p>"You are Pyotr Vasilevich Uranov?" he queried; and to
A.J.'s affirmative, merely replied: "Take him away."</p>

<p>The guards continued their journey with him along
many corridors and across several courtyards. He knew
that he was in a prison, though which one out of the many
in Petersburg he had no idea. At last one of the guards
unlocked and opened a door and pushed him into a room
already occupied by what at first seemed a large crowd. But
that was because, in the dim light admitted by a small and
heavily-barred window, it was difficult to distinguish the
inhabitants from their bundles of clothing.</p>

<p>They had seemed asleep when A.J. entered, but as soon
as the guards retired and the door was relocked they all
burst into sudden chatter. A.J., dazed and astonished,
found himself surrounded by gesticulating men and youths,
all eager to know who he was, why he had been sent there,
and so on. He told them his name, but thought it wiser to
say that no charge had been made against him so far. They
said: "Ah, that is how it very often happens. They do not
tell you anything." They even laughed when he asked the
name of the prison; it amused them to have to supply such
information. It was the Goncharnaya, they said.</p>

<p>Altogether there were a score or more inhabitants of
that room. About half were youths of between seventeen
and twenty-one. One of them told A.J. he had already been
imprisoned for two months without knowing any charge
against him, and there was a steady hopelessness in his
voice as he said so. "These people are not all politicals,"
he went on, whispering quietly amidst the surrounding
chatter. "Some are criminals&mdash;some probably government
agents sent to spy on us&mdash;who knows?&mdash;there is
always that sort of thing going on. A fortnight ago two
fellows were taken away&mdash;we don't know where, of
course&mdash;nothing has happened since then until you
came."</p>

<p>Considering their plight the majority of the prisoners
were cheerful; they laughed, played with cards and dice,
sang songs, and exchanged anecdotes. One of them, a Jew,
had an extensive repertoire of obscenity, and whenever the
time fell heavily somebody would shout: "Tell us another
story, Jewboy." Another prisoner spent most of his time
crouched in a corner, silent and almost motionless; he
was ill, though nobody could say exactly what was the
matter with him. He could not take the prison food, and
so had practically to starve. The food was nauseating
enough to anyone in good health, since apart from black
bread it consisted of nothing but a pailful of fish soup
twice a day, to be shared amongst all the occupants. A.J.
could not stomach it till his third day, and even then
it made him heave; it smelt and tasted vilely and looked
disgusting when it was brought in with fish-heads floating
about on its greasy surface. It was nourishing, however,
and to avoid it altogether would have been unwise. There
were no spoons or drinking vessels; each man dipped his
own personal mug or basin into the pail and took what he
wanted, and the same mugs, unwashed, served for the tea
which the men were allowed to make for themselves.</p>

<p>At night they slept on planks ranged round the wall
a foot from the floor. The cracks in the planks were
full of bugs. Most of the men were extremely verminous;
indeed, it was impossible not to be so after a few days in
such surroundings. A smell of dirty clothes and general
unwholesomeness was always in the air, mixed with the stale
fish smell from the soup-pail and other smells arising from
the crude sanitary methods of the place.</p>

<p>The warders were mostly quite friendly and could be
bribed to supply small quantities of such things as tea,
sugar, and tobacco (to be chewed, not smoked). The entire
prison routine was an affair of curious contrasts&mdash;it
was slack almost to the point of being good-humoured,
yet, beyond it all, there was a sense of complete and
utter hopelessness. One felt the power of authority as a
shapeless and rather muddled monster, not too stern to be
sometimes easy-going, but quite careless enough to forget
the existence of any individual victim. Most hopeless of
all was the way in which some of the victims accepted the
situation; they did not complain, they did not show anger,
indignation, or even (it seemed) much anxiety. When the
warders unlocked the door twice a day their eyes lifted
up, with neither hope nor fear, but with just a sort of
slow, smouldering fever. And when the man in the corner
grew obviously very ill, they did what they could for him,
shrugged their shoulders, went on with their card playing,
and let him die. After all, what else was possible? Only in
the manner and glances of a few of the youngsters did there
appear any sign of fiercer emotions.</p>

<p>One of the prisoners, a political, had a passion for
acquiring information on every possible subject. Most of
the others disliked him, and A.J., to whom he attached
himself as often as he could, found him a great bore. "I am
always anxious to improve my small knowledge of the world,"
he would say, as a preface to a battery of questions. "You
are a person of education, I can see&mdash;can you tell
me whether Hong Kong is a British possession?" Something
stirred remotely in A.J.'s memory; he said, Yes, he
believed it was. "And is Australia the largest island in
the world?" Yes, again; he believed so. "Then, sir, if you
could further oblige me&mdash;what is the smallest island?"
A.J. could never quite decide whether the man were an
eccentric or a half-wit. He afterwards learned that he had
aimed a bomb at a chief of police in Courland.</p>

<p>All this time A.J. was immensely worried about his own
position, which, from conversation with other prisoners, he
gathered might be very serious. There were, apparently, few
limits to the power of the police; they might keep arrested
persons in prison without trial for any length of time, or,
at any moment, if they so desired, they might send them
into exile anywhere in the vast region between the Urals
and the Far East.</p>

<p>For five weeks nothing happened; no one either left or
joined the prisoners. Then, on the thirty-eighth day (A.J.
had kept count) one of the warders, during his morning
visit, singled out A.J. and another prisoner to accompany
him. From the fact that the two were ordered to carry
their bundles with them, the rest of the prisoners drew
the likeliest conclusion, and there were many sentimental
farewells between friends. The jailer obligingly waited
till all this was finished; he did not mind; time was
of little concern to him or to anyone else at the
Goncharnaya. Then, with a good-humoured shrug of the
shoulders, he relocked the door and led the two prisoners
across courtyards and along corridors into the room that
A.J. had visited on first entering the prison. The same man
was there behind the desk, twirling his moustache upwards
almost to meet the bluish pouches under his eyes.</p>

<p>He dealt first with the other prisoner, verifying the
man's name and then declaring, with official emphasis:
"You are found guilty of treason against the government
and are sentenced to exile. That is all." The man began
to speak, but a police guard who was in the room dragged
him roughly away. When the shouts of both had died down in
the distance, the man behind the desk turned to A.J. "You
are Pyotr Vasilevich Uranov? You too are found guilty of
treason. Your sentence is exile&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what is the charge? What am I accused of?
Surely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence! Take him away!"</p>

<p>A police guard seized him by the arms and dragged him
towards the door and out into the corridor. A.J. did not
shout or struggle; he was suddenly dumbfounded, and into
the vacuum of bewilderment came slowly, like pain, the
clutchings of a dreadful panic. Although he had had exile
in mind for weeks, it had been a blow to hear the word
actually pronounced over him.</p>

<p>Outside in the corridor the rough manners of the police
guard changed abruptly to a mood of almost fatherly
solicitude. "I wouldn't worry so much if I were you," he
remarked soothingly. "Personally, I should much prefer
exile to being herded in jail with criminals and such-like.
I always think it is a great scandal to mix up decent
fellows like yourself with that scum." He went on to give
A.J. some practical advice. "As an exile you are entitled
to a fair amount of luggage, though the authorities will
try to do you out of your privileges if they can. I suggest
that you make out a list of everything you want to take
with you, and I will see that the things are collected from
where you have been living."</p>

<p>A.J. was too tired and depressed at that moment to
consider the matter with any zest, and the guard continued,
with a curious mixture of friendliness and officialdom:
"Ah, I see&mdash;you are upset&mdash;perhaps, then, you
will be so good as to tell me and <i>I</i> will make out the
list. Oh yes, I can write&mdash;I am a man of education,
like yourself. Come now, there is no time to lose. You will
want heavy winter clothes, the usual cooking utensils,
blankets, and things like that. Oh yes, and books&mdash;you
are permitted by the regulations to take books with you.
You are a reader, of course? Ah, education is a wonderful
thing, is it not? Perhaps you would like me to have your
books packed up and sent with the other things?"</p>

<p>"There are too many of them," A.J. answered dully. "Far
too many to carry."</p>

<p>"But you would be allowed to take a dozen or so. Do you
mean that you have more than a dozen books? You are perhaps
a professor, then, eh? Ah well, I will ask them to send on
a dozen for you, anyhow."</p>

<p>And in due course the pertinacious fellow, whose name
was Savanrog, compiled his list and the bureaucratic
machine, with numerous clankings and rumblings, got to work
upon it. Savanrog was delighted when, a few days later, the
complete assortment of articles arrived. By that time A.J.
had grown more resigned to his fate, a few days of solitary
confinement in a comparatively clean and comfortable cell
having helped considerably towards such a state. "You see,"
Savanrog exclaimed, taking both A.J.'s hands in his and
shaking them, "I have managed it all for you! Oh yes, I do
not let anything slip past me. It is the turn of fortune
that has brought us together, Pyotr Vasilevich&mdash;I have
done my duty&mdash;and as for our acquaintance, it has been
a thing of delight. I have always counted it a privilege to
make myself known to eminent politicals like yourself."</p>

<p>"But surely I am not an eminent political?" A.J.
answered, half-smiling.</p>

<p>"Ah, you are too modest. Were you not the friend of
Maronin, who killed Danilov, Minister of the Interior?"</p>

<p>A.J. let the question pass. It was the first intimation
he had had that his offence was reckoned as 'friendship'
with the boy-assassin. He had sometimes feared that he
would be ranked as an accessory to the crime itself; in
which case, of course, his status would have been that of a
criminal, not a political. Savanrog's chatter was, in its
way, reassuring.</p>

<p>At last the morning came when he was ordered to prepare
for the journey. Savanrog, at the final moment, shook
hands with him, kissed him on both cheeks, and gave him
a black cigar. "It will be a breach of regulations to
smoke it, until you are across the Urals," he told him,
with a last spasm of official correctitude. Then, leading
A.J. into the corridor, he marched him into a courtyard
in which a hundred or so other prisoners were already on
parade, and with a great show of blustering brutality,
pushed him into line. A.J. did not recognise any of the
faces near him. He was ordered to separate his luggage
into two bundles, a personal one to carry on his back, and
a larger one consisting of things he would not require
until the end of the journey, wherever and whenever that
might be. The larger bundles of all the prisoners were
then collected into a van and carried away. Afterwards
the men themselves were divided up into two detachments,
and here came the final welcome proof that A.J. was a
political; he was not put into the group of those who
had to wait for the blacksmith to manacle their wrists
together. Finally the whole melancholy procession was led
out through the prison-gate into the street. It was only
a very short distance to the railway station, and the
throngs on the pavements stared with just that helpless,
half-compassionate, half-casual curiosity which A.J. had
observed on so many previous occasions when he had himself
formed part of them.</p>

<p>After marching into a goods yard beyond the station
and halting beside a train, the manacled prisoners were
pushed into cattle-trucks, but the politicals were allowed
to choose their own places in ordinary third-class
rolling-stock, passably clean and comfortable. A.J.
found himself cordially welcomed by the men of his
compartment. There were five of them, with one exception
all young like himself. The exception was a very ancient
fellow with a huge head and a sweeping beard. Even
before the train moved off A.J. was told a good deal
about his fellow-passengers. The old man's name was
Trigorin&mdash;just Trigorin&mdash;he seemed to possess
no other. His offence had been the preaching of roadside
sermons in which had occurred certain remarks capable of
seditious interpretation. He had been exiled once before
for a similar offence. "I am an old man," he said, "and
nothing very dreadful can happen to me now. But of course
it is different for you youngsters."</p>

<p>The journey to Moscow took two days, and then there was
considerable delay while the prison-train was shunted round
the city and linked up with other coaches from different
parts of the country. Finally the complete train, by this
time very long, set out at a slow pace on its tremendous
eastern journey. To many of the prisoners there was
something ominous in the fact that they were now actually
on the track of the Trans-Siberian, and spirits were low
during the first few hours. A.J., however, did not share
the general gloom; he remembered Siberia from his previous
visit, and the name did not strike any particular terror
into his mind. When some of the young men spoke with
dismay of the possible fate in store for them, he felt
strongly tempted to tell them that parts of Siberia, at any
rate, were no worse than many parts of Europe. Trigorin,
however, saved him from any temptation to recount his own
experiences. Trigorin described how conditions had improved
since the opening of the railway; during his first exile,
he said, he had had actually to walk three thousand miles
from railhead at Perm, and much of the way through blinding
rain and snow. He gave lurid and graphic descriptions of
the horrors of the old forwarding prisons at Tyumen and
Tomsk, and of the convict barges on the rivers, and of
the great Siberian highway along which so many thousands
of exiles had been driven to misery and death. "Things
are much better now," he said, with sadly twinkling eyes.
"We politicals are pampered&mdash;no floggings, hospitals
if we fall ill&mdash;what more can we expect, after all?
You youngsters, whose knowledge of Siberia comes from
Dostoyevsky's book and a few lurid novelettes, can't
realise what a good time politicals have nowadays. We die,
of course, but only of loneliness, and a man may die of
that in bed in his own home, may he not?"</p>

<p>A mood of curious fatalism sank upon A.J. during those
days and nights of travel. The journey was not too arduous;
the food was coarse, but sufficient in quantity and fairly
nourishing; the military guards were easygoing fellows,
especially after all the politicals had given parole that
they would not attempt to escape during the train-journey.
The future, of course, loomed grimly enough, but A.J. did
not seem to feel it; his mind had already attuned itself to
grimness. He kept remembering his interviews with Stanford
and Forrester, and their repeated assurances that the game
was one of 'heads somebody else wins and tails you lose.'
Well, he had lost, and he could not complain that he had
not been amply warned of the possibility. He felt, however,
that he had had distinctly bad luck; it had been pure
misfortune, and not any personal carelessness or stupidity
of his own, that had led to his present position. But for
his friendship with Maronin all would have still been well.
Yet he did not regret that friendship. It was, on the
contrary, one of the few things in his life that he prized
in memory.</p>

<p>He remembered one of Stanfield's remarks: "If anything
goes wrong, you will have to become a Russian subject
completely." That seemed of peculiar significance now that
things <i>had</i> gone wrong, and it was true, too, that whether
he willed it so or not, he was becoming Pyotr Vasilevich
Uranov in a way he had certainly never been before. He
wondered frequently whether by this time the Secret
Service people knew all about his trouble. Most probably
information had reached them, by their own secret channels,
within a few hours of his arrest. He could picture their
attitude&mdash;a shrug of the shoulders, a vaguely pitying
look, and then&mdash;forgetfulness. Perhaps Stanfield might
have commented to Forrester or Forrester to Stanfield:
"Well, <i>he</i> didn't last long, eh? Still, we warned him.
Wonder if he'll play the fool by trying to make out he's
English?"</p>

<p>A.J. had no intention of so playing the fool. It was
not merely that he had given his word, but that his
common sense informed him how utterly useless it would
be. Apart from his knowledge of the English language,
there was nothing at all he could advance in support
of any claim he might make to be other than the Pyotr
Vasilevich Uranov set out with authentic-looking detail on
his passport and papers of identity. And even supposing
he managed to persuade the authorities to enquire into
his case, the result could only mean a communication
to the British Embassy, with what result he had been
warned. "The British authorities would merely arch their
eyebrows with great loftiness and disown you," had been
Stanfield's way of putting it. No, there was nothing to
be gained by attempting the impossible; the only course
was simple endurance for the time being, and later, if he
could manage it, escape. Henceforward he was doomed to be
Pyotr Vasilevich Uranov without qualification, and, rather
curiously, he now began to feel what he had hardly felt
before&mdash;a certain pride in his new identity. He <i>was</i>
Pyotr Vasilevich Uranov, exiled to Siberia for a political
offence; and he felt that same quiet, unending antagonism
towards the imperial authorities that the other exiles
felt; he began to understand it, to understand them, to
understand why they were so calm, why they so rarely roused
the sleeping fury in their souls. They were saving it, as
themselves also, for some vaguely future day.</p>

<p>He began, too, to breathe with comfort and comprehension
the vast easy-going laziness of the country; he perceived
why no one ever hurried, why trains were always late,
why the word '<i>seychas</i>' ('presently') was so popular
and universal; after all, if people were merely waiting
for something to happen, there could be no special
urgency about things done in the meantime. And they
were waiting for something to happen&mdash;the exiles,
the soldier-guards, the criminals in their chains, the
railway-workers, the prison officials&mdash;a calm,
passionless anticipation gleamed in their eyes when one
caught them sometimes unawares. As the train rumbled
eastwards this sense of anticipation and timelessness
deepened immeasurably; life was just sunrise and
sun-setting; food, drink, talk; the train would pull up in
a siding; when would it move out again? '<i>Seychas</i>,' of
course; that might be in an hour or two, or perhaps the
next day; nobody knew&mdash;nobody very much cared. When
the train stopped, the prisoners sometimes climbed out and
walked about the country near the track, or else lay down
in the long grass with the midday sun on their faces. The
nights were cold, but no snow had fallen yet. At Omsk,
Krasnoyarsk, and other places, some of the men left the
train, in charge of Cossack guards. Trigorin explained that
they were the milder cases&mdash;men who had not definitely
committed any crime, but were merely suspected of being
'dangerous' or of having 'dangerous opinions.' "It is
clear," he declared comfortingly, "that something much more
serious is in store for all of us. We shall know when we
reach Irkutsk."</p>

<p>They reached the Siberian capital three weeks after
leaving Moscow; the busy city, magnificently situated at
the confluence of two rivers, gleamed brightly in the late
autumnal sun. The exiles were marched from the station
to the central forwarding prison and there split up into
several groups. Trigorin was sent off almost immediately;
he was bound for Chita, near the Manchurian frontier, and
was to travel there with a contingent of local criminals.
The other politicals were immensely indignant about this;
it was against all the rules to put a political along with
criminals, and much as they hated the penal code, such a
breach of it stirred them to punctilious anger. The prison
governor apologised; he was very sorry, but he could not
help it; Trigorin must go with the criminals, but he would
be given a separate railway coach. "Besides," he explained,
reassuringly, "they are only local murderers&mdash;not
bad fellows, some of them." Trigorin himself did not
object at all, and actually rebuked his friends for their
uncharitable championship. "Let us not forget," he said,
"that the only person to whom Christ definitely promised
paradise was a criminal. He, the greatest of all political
prisoners, was actually crucified between two of them."</p>

<p>A.J.'s other fellow-passengers were also sent away,
but whither, he could not discover. He himself was kept
at Irkutsk. It was a better managed prison than the
Goncharnaya at Petersburg, but after the easy-going
train-journey the return to routine of any kind was irksome.
A.J. found most of his fellow-prisoners in a state of
depression and melancholy that soon began to affect him also,
especially when the freezing up of the river and the first
big snowstorm of the season marked the onset of Siberian
winter.</p>

<p>The prison governor was a good-tempered, jovial fellow
who liked to make the days and nights pass by as pleasantly
as possible for himself and mankind in general. Every
morning he would tour the prison and greet the men with a
bluff, companionable&mdash;"Good morning, boys&mdash;how
goes it?" He was always particular about their food and
the warmth of their rooms, and he would sometimes pay a
surprise visit to the kitchens to sample the soup that was
being prepared for them. He seemed a little in awe of some
of the politicals, but he was on friendly terms with most
of the criminals, and enjoyed hearing them give their own
accounts of their various crimes. The more bloodthirsty and
exciting these were, the better he liked them; he would
sometimes, at the end of a particularly thrilling recital,
clap a man on the back and exclaim: "Well, you <i>are</i> a
fellow, and no mistake! To think of you actually doing all
that!"</p>

<p>Naturally, the criminals invented all kinds of
incredibilities to please him.</p>

<p>A.J. soon found that the only way to keep his mind from
descending into the bitterest and most soul-destroying
gloom was to think of the only inspiring possibility open
to a prisoner&mdash;that of escape. Together with another
political he began to plan some method of getting away,
not immediately, but as soon as the spring weather should
make the open country habitable. This task, with all
its complications, helped the winter days to pass with
moderate rapidity. Unfortunately a fellow-prisoner who
was a government spy (there were many of these, sometimes
unknown even to the prison authorities) gave the plan away,
and A.J. and his co-conspirator were summoned before the
governor. His attitude was rather that of a pained and
reproachful guardian whose fatherly consideration has been
basely rewarded. "Really, you know," he told them, "that
was a very foolish thing to do. Your attempt to escape
has already been reported to Petersburg, and it will only
make your eventual punishment more severe. The original
idea was to exile you to Yakutsk as soon as the season
permitted, but now heaven knows where you will be sent."
And he added, almost pathetically: "Whatever made you act
so unreasonably?"</p>

<p>So the position seemed rather more hopeless than ever.
Soon, too, the easy-going governor was sent away to another
prison. The Petersburg authorities transferred him to
Omsk, and in his place was sent a different type of man
altogether&mdash;a small, dapper, bristling-moustached
martinet, whom everyone&mdash;prisoners and prison
officials alike&mdash;detested with venomous intensity.
It was he who, the following May, sent for A.J. and
barked at him in staccato tones: "Uranov, your case has
been reconsidered by the authorities in view of your
recent attempt to escape. Your revised sentence is that
of banishment for ten years to Ust-Yansk. You will
go first to Yakutsk, and then wait for the winter season.
You will need special kit, which you will be allowed to
purchase, and I am instructed to pay you the customary
exile's allowance, dated back to the time of your entry
into Siberia. Perhaps you will sign this receipt."</p>

<p>A fortnight later the journey commenced. A.J. had spent
part of the interval in making purchases in the Irkutsk
shops; the two Cossack guards who were to accompany
him to his place of exile advised him what to buy and
how much to pay for it. They were big, simple-hearted,
illiterate fellows and could give him few details about
Ust-Yansk, except that the journey there would take
many months. A.J. suspected that with the usual Siberian
attitude towards time, they were merely estimating vaguely;
he could not believe that even the remotest exile station
could be quite so inaccessible. The first stage was by road
and water to Yakutsk. Along with hundreds of other exiles,
including a few women, the trek was begun across the still
frost-bound country to Kachug, near the source of the Lena.
This part of the journey was made in twenty-mile stages
and lasted over a week. The nights were spent in large
barn-like sheds, horribly verminous, and well guarded by
sentries on all sides.</p>

<p>At Kachug the entire detachment was transferred to
barges, and resigned itself to a two months' meandering
down the river to Yakutsk, which was reached towards the
end of July. The horrors of that journey, under a sky that
never, during the short summer, darkened to more than
twilight, engraved still more deeply the mood of fatalism
that had already descended on most of the prisoners. A.J.
was no exception. He did not find himself worrying much,
and he was not nearly so low-spirited as he had been amidst
the comparatively comfortable surroundings of the Irkutsk
prison. He felt scarcely more than a growing numbness, as
if a part of his brain and personality were losing actual
existence.</p>

<p>Yakutsk was almost pleasant after the barges, and the
remaining weeks of the summer passed without incident.
Prison regulations, owing to the remoteness of the
settlement, were lax enough, and A.J. made several
acquaintances. One of them, an educated exile who had
been allowed to set up as a boot-repairer, had even heard
of Ust-Yansk. It was on the Indigirka river, he
thought, well beyond the Arctic Circle. It could only be
a very small settlement and it was years since he had
heard of anyone being sent there. "Perhaps they have made
a mistake," he hazarded, with dispassionate cheerfulness.
"Or perhaps the place does not exist at all and they
will have to bring you back. That <i>has</i> happened, you
know. There was a man sent to one place last year and
the Cossacks themselves couldn't find it. They looked
for it all winter and then had to hurry back before the
thaw began." He laughed heartily. "I'm not inventing the
story, I assure you. Some of those Petersburg officials
don't know their own country&mdash;they just stare at
a map and say&mdash;'Oh, we'll send him here&mdash;or
there'&mdash;and maybe the map is wrong all the time!"</p>

<p>Early in September the Lena, miles wide, began to freeze
over, and soon the whole visible world became transfixed in
the cold, darkening glare of winter. The two guards who had
left Irkutsk in charge of A.J. and who had spent the summer
amusing themselves as well as the amenities of Yakutsk
permitted, now indicated that the time for the resumption
of the journey had arrived. From now onwards it became a
much more personal and solitary affair&mdash;almost, in
fact, a polar expedition, but without the spur of hope
and ambition to mitigate hardship. The three men, heavily
furred, set out by reindeer sledge into the long greyness
of the sub-Arctic winter. Two of them carried arms, yet
the third man, defenceless, was given the place of honour
on all occasions&mdash;at night-time in the wayside huts,
usually uninhabited, and during the day whenever a halt
was made for rest and food. The temperature sank lower and
lower and the sky darkened with every mile; they crossed
a range of bleak mountains and descended into a land of
frozen whiteness unbroken anywhere save by stunted willows.
For food, there were birds which the guards shot or snared,
and unlimited fish could be obtained by breaking through
the thick ice in the streams. The fish froze stiff on being
taken out of the water; they had to be cut into slices and
eaten raw between hunks of bread. A.J.'s palate had by this
time grown much less fastidious, and he found such food not
at all unpleasant when he was hungry enough. The cold air
and the harsh activity of the daily travel bred also in him
a sense of physical fitness which, at any other time, he
would have relished; as it was, however, he felt nothing
but a grim and ever-deepening insensitiveness to all
outward impressions. He imagined vaguely the vast distance
he had already travelled, but it did not terrify him; it
was merely a memory of emptiness and boredom, and though he
knew that the end of the journey would mean the end of even
the last vestige of changefulness, he yet longed for it,
because, for the moment, it seemed a change in itself.</p>

<p>One evening, thirteen weeks after leaving Yakutsk, the
three men were crossing a plain of snow under the light of
the full moon. At the last settlement, ten days previously,
they had exchanged their reindeer transport for dogs,
and since then had been traversing this same white and
empty plain. There seemed, indeed, no obvious reason why
the plain and the journey might not go on for ever. The
temperature was fifty below zero. A.J. had noticed that for
some hours the guards had been muttering to each other,
which was unusual, for in such cold air it was painful to
speak. Suddenly, out of the silver gloom, appeared the
hazy shapes of a few snow-covered roofs; the guards gave a
cry; the dogs barked; a few answering cries came from the
dimness ahead. They had reached Ust-Yansk.</p>

<p>It was smaller and more desolate than he had imagined.
There were only four Russians in exile there, none of them
educated men; the rest of the population consisted of a
score or more natives of very low intelligence. The native
men, under the direction of the guards, began to dig an
entry through the snow into an unoccupied timber hut that
was to belong to the new exile; there were several of
these deserted huts, for the settlement had formerly been
larger. The natives looked on in amazement when A.J. began
to unpack the bundle that he had not been allowed to touch
since leaving Petersburg; they had never before seen such
things as books, writing-paper, or a kerosene-lamp. The
Russians looked on also with a curiosity scarcely less
childlike; they had seen no strange face for years, and
their eagerness bordered on almost maniacal excitement.
A.J. addressed them with a few cordial words and they were
all around him in a moment, shaking his hands and picking
up one after another of his belongings; they had evidently
been half afraid of him at first. One of them said: "This
shows that the Government has not forgotten us&mdash;they
know we are still here, or they would not have sent
you."</p>

<p>A fire was made, and the two Cossack guards stayed the
night in the hut. The next morning they hitched up their
dog teams, shook hands cordially enough, and began the
long return journey. A.J. watched them till the distance
swallowed up their sleigh and the hoarse barking of the
animals. Then he set to work to make his habitation more
comfortable.</p>

<p>Ust-Yansk was close to but not actually on the
Arctic Ocean; the nearest settlements, not much larger,
were four hundred and four hundred and fifty miles to
west and east respectively. There was no communication of
any regular kind with the civilised world; sometimes a
fur-trapper would take a message and pass it on to someone
else who might be going to Yakutsk, but even in most
favourable circumstances an answer could scarcely arrive in
less than twenty months. The nearest railway and telegraph
stations were over three thousand miles away.</p>

<p>The year was composed of day and night; the day lasted
from June to September only. In winter the temperature
sometimes fell to seventy below zero, and there were
week-long blizzards in which no living human being could
stir a yard out of his hut. During the short summer the
climate became mild and moist; the river thawed and
overflowed, causing vast swamps and floodings that cut off
the settlement from the world outside even more effectively
than did the winter cold and darkness.</p>

<p>A.J. had brought a fair supply of tea and tobacco,
and with small gifts of these he could secure the manual
services of as many natives as he wanted, apart from the
four Russians, who would have lived their whole lives as
personal slaves in his hut if he had wished it. He did not
feel particularly sad, but he did begin to feel a strange
Robinson-Crusoe kind of majesty that was rather like an
ache gnawing at him all the time. He was the only person
in Ust-Yansk who could read, write, work a simple
sum, or understand a rough map. The most intelligent of
the Russians had no more than the mind of a peasant, with
all its abysmal ignorance and with only a touch of its
shrewdness. The others were less than half-witted, perhaps
as a result of their long exile. They remembered the names
of the villages from which they had been banished, but
they had no proper idea where those villages were, how
long their banishment had lasted, or what it had been for.
Yet compared with the native Yakuts, even such men were
intelligent higher beings. The Yakuts, with their women
and families, reached to depths of ugliness, filth, and
stupidity that A.J. had hardly believed possible for beings
classifiable as mankind. Their total vocabulary did not
comprise more than a hundred or so sounds, hardly to be
called words. In addition to physical unpleasantness (many
were afflicted with a loathsome combination of syphilis and
leprosy), they were abominable thieves and liars; indeed,
their only approach to virtue was a species of dog-like
attachment to anyone who had established himself as their
master. With a little of the most elementary organisation
they could have murdered all the exiles and plundered
the huts, but they lacked both the initiative and the
virility. Life to them was but an unending struggle of
short summers and long winters, of snow and ice, blizzard
and thaw, of fishing in the icy pools and trapping small
animals for flesh and fur, of lust, disease, and occasional
gluttony. They had never seen a tree, and knew timber
only as material providentially floated down to them on
the spring-time floods. Even when he had picked up their
rudimentary language, A.J. could not interest them by any
talk of the outer world. They were incapable of imagination, and
the only thing that stirred them to limited excitement was
the kerosene-lamp, which, after some experimenting, he made
to burn with certain kinds of fish-oil.</p>

<p>Now especially he had cause to be grateful to Savanrog,
the enterprising and sympathetic prison-guard at the
Goncharnaya. For the luggage, packed according to the
latter's instructions, included all kinds of things that
A.J. would never have thought of for himself, but which now
were found to be especially useful. With them, and with
the miscellaneous articles he had purchased in Irkutsk, he
was not badly equipped. He had his twelve books, chosen
apparently at random from his shelves in Petersburg; the
only one he would have thought of selecting himself was a
translation of <i>Don Quixote</i>, but the others soon grew to
be odd but no less faithful companions. One was a school
text-book in algebra, another an out-of-date year-book;
another was Dickens's <i>Great Expectations</i>&mdash;of course
in Russian. Mr. Pumblechook and Joe Gargery became the
friends of all his waking and sleeping dreams, and before
them alone he could relax and smile.</p>

<p>Besides his few books his luggage contained several
other things never seen in Ust-Yansk before. He had a
watch and a clinical thermometer, a few bottles and jars of
simple medicines, and a pair of scissors; he had also (he
was sure) the only boot-trees north of the Arctic Circle.
The police in Petersburg, with typical inconsequence, had
packed them inside a pair of field-boots.</p>

<p>Oddly, perhaps, the time did not seem to pass very
slowly. There was always so much to be done&mdash;the
mere toil of getting food, of repairing and improving
the hut, of keeping himself well clothed to withstand
the almost inconceivable cold. He did a little amateur
doctoring whenever he found anything he fancied he could
cure amidst that nightmare of disease and degradation. He
made notes, without enthusiasm, yet somehow because he felt
he must, about the customs and language of the natives.
He even tried to teach the least stupid of the Russians
to learn the Russian alphabet. And whenever, during the
long winter, or while day after day of blizzard kept him
a prisoner in the hut, he felt pangs of loneliness or
disappointment piercing to his soul, he would slip into
a coma of insensibility and wait. The waiting was not
often for long. When, after the grey night of winter, the
sunlight showed again over the frozen earth, at first so
very timidly, he welcomed it with a smile that no one
saw. Sometimes at midsummer he sailed clown the swollen
river in a small boat; once, with a couple of natives,
he reached the open Arctic and made a rough sketch-map
of fifty miles of coast-line. He hardly knew why he did
such things&mdash;certainly not from any idea of ultimate
escape. There was nothing at all to prevent his making such
an attempt, except the knowledge of its utter hopelessness.
His stern jailers were the swamps in summer and the icy
wastes in winter; and even if by some miracle, he could
pass them by, there was no place of safety to be reached.
It would have been more hopeful to make for the North Pole
than for the semi-civilised places in Siberia.</p>

<p>His first winter at Ust-Yansk was that of
1909-10.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="part3"></a>PART III</h2>

<p class="first">IN the late spring of 1917 a small party
of Cossacks set out from Yakutsk by reindeer and dog
sledge. They were seven in number and travelled swiftly,
visiting each one in turn of the remoter settlements.
Ust-Yansk was almost the last.</p>

<p>They reached it in the twilight of a May noontide,
and at the sound of their arrival the entire native
population&mdash;some dozen Yakut families&mdash;turned out
of their huts to meet them, surrounding the clog-teams and
chattering excitedly.</p>

<p>At length a tall figure, clad in heavy furs, approached
the throng; and even in that dim northern light there was
no mistaking leadership of such a kind. One of the soldiers
made a slight obeisance and said, in Russian: "Your honour,
we are from Yakutsk."</p>

<p>A quiet, rather slow voice answered: "You are most
welcome, then. You are the first to visit us for three
years. Come into my hut. My name is Uranov."</p>

<p>He led them a little distance over the frozen snow to a
hut rather larger than the rest. They were surprised when
they entered, for it was so much better furnished than any
other they had seen. The walls were hung with clean skins,
and the stove did not smoke badly, and there were even such
things as tables, chairs, a shelf of hooks, a lamp, and
a raised bed. Uranov motioned the men to make themselves
comfortable. There was something in his quiet, impersonal
demeanour that made them feel shy, shy even of conveying
the news that they had brought with them. They stood round,
unwilling to sit in those astonishing chairs; most of them
in the end squatted on the timber floor.</p>

<p>Uranov was busying himself with the samovar. Meanwhile
the soldiers could only stare at one another, while the
still shouting and chattering Yakuts waited outside the hut
in a tempest of curiosity. At last the spokesman of the
party began: "Brother, we are the bearers of good news.
Don't be too startled when you hear it, though it certainly
is enough to send any man such as yourself out of his wits
for joy. At Kolymsk that did actually happen to one poor
fellow, so you will understand, brother, why we are taking
such a long time to tell you."</p>

<p>Then Uranov turned from the samovar and smiled. It was a
curious smile, for though it lit up his face it seemed to
light up even more the grimness that was there. "Whatever
news it is," he said, "you may be sure I shall not be
affected in that way."</p>

<p>"Then, brother, it is this. You are a free man. All
exiles everywhere are now released and may return to their
homes, by order of the new revolutionary government.
Think of it&mdash;there has been a revolution in
Petrograd&mdash;the Emperor has been deposed." And as if
a hidden spring had suddenly been touched, the soldiers
all began to talk, to explain, to shout out the good news,
with all its details, to this man who knew nothing. They
had told the same story at each one of the settlements,
and every time of telling had made it more marvellous to
them. Their eyes blazed with joy and pity, and pride at
having the privilege of conveying the first blessings of
revolution to those who stood most in need of them. But if
only Uranov had been a little more excited, they would have
been happier. He handed them tea so quietly, and after they
had all finished talking he merely said: "Yes, it is good
news. I will pack my things."</p>

<p>The soldiers again 'stared at one another, a little
awed, perhaps even a little chilled; they had enjoyed such
orgies of hysteria at the other settlements, but this man
seemed different&mdash;as if the Arctic had entered his
soul.</p>

<p>He said, rather perceiving their disappointment: "It
is very kind of you to have come so far to tell me. As I
said before, there has been no news for three years. There
were four other exiles here then, but that same winter
three died of typhus, and another was drowned the following
summer."</p>

<p>"So for over a year you have been altogether alone?"
said one of the soldiers.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. There have been the Yakuts." And once more that
grim smile.</p>

<p>They fell to talking again of the revolution and its
manifold blessings, and after a little time they noticed
that Uranov seemed hardly to be listening; he was already
taking his books from the shelf and making them into a neat
pile.</p>

<p>Two days later eight men set out for the south. There
was need to hurry, as the warmer season was approaching and
the streams would soon melt and overflow.</p>

<p>As they covered mile after mile it was as if the earth
warmed and blossomed to meet them; each day was longer and
brighter than the one before; the stunted willows became
taller, and at last there were trees with green buds on
them; the sun shone higher in the sky, melting the snows
and releasing every stream into bursting, bubbling life,
till the ice in the rivers gave a thunderous shiver from
bank to bank; and the soldiers threw off their fur jackets
and shouted for joy and sang songs all the day long. At
Verkhoyansk there was a junction with other parties of
released exiles, and later on, when they had crossed the
mountains, more exiles met them from Ust Vilyuysk, Kolymsk,
and places that even the map ignores.</p>

<p>Yakutsk, which was reached at the end of July, was
already full of soldiers and exiles, as well as knee-deep
in thick black mud and riddled with pestilence. Every
day the exiles waited on the banks of the Lena for the
boat that was to take them further south, and every hour
fresh groups arrived from the north and north-east. Food
and money were scarce; sick men and women staggered into
the settlement with stories of others who had died during
the journey; a few were mad and walked about moaning and
laughing; every night the soldiers drank themselves into
quarrelsomeness and careered about firing shots into the
air and falling off the timbered paths into the thick mud;
every morning dead bodies were pushed quietly into the Lena
and sent northwards on their icy journey. Yet beyond all
the misery and famine and pestilence, Yakutsk was a city of
hope.</p>

<p>Uranov had little money, but he did not go hungry. The
seven soldiers of his escort had taken a curious fancy to
him. They called him their captain, and saw to it that he
always had food and shelter. There was much in him that
they did not understand, but also something that attracted
them peculiarly. During the first part of the southward
expedition he had naturally taken command, for he knew
the land far better than they, and was in less danger of
losing the track. After that it had seemed natural that he
should go on telling them when and where to halt, where
to stay for the nights, and so on. They let him do that,
in spite of (or perhaps because of) the fact that they
thought him a little mad. They had a nickname for him which
meant 'The man who has forgotten how to talk.' It was an
obvious exaggeration, since he did talk whenever there was
need for it; yet even on such occasions it was as if he
were thinking out the words, and as if each word cost him
effort. They told one another that this was because he had
been exiled by himself and had been left alone so long. By
the time of reaching Yakutsk the legend had grown; Uranov,
they were saying, had been such a dangerous revolutionary
that, by the ex-Emperor's personal order, he had been sent
to the remotest and most terrible spot in all Siberia.
And after a week of gossip in Yakutsk it was easy to say
and believe that he had been ten years utterly alone in
Ust-Yansk, and that he had not spoken a word during
the whole of that time. So now, when the soldiers saw him
reading a book or making pencil notes on paper, they said
he must be learning language over again.</p>

<p>At last came the long-awaited steamer, an old
paddle-boat, built in Glasgow in the 'seventies, towing
behind it a couple of odorous and verminous convict-barges.
Fifteen hundred persons crammed themselves into the boat
and another thousand into the barges. There was nowhere
to sleep except on the bare boards of the deck or in the
foul and pestilential holds; men and women sickened, died,
and were dropped overboard during that month of weary
chug-chugging upstream through a forlorn land.</p>

<p>By August the exiles were in Irkutsk. The city was in
chaos; its population had been increased threefold; it was
the neck of the channel through which Siberia was emptying
herself of the accumulated suffering of generations. From
all directions poured in an unceasing flood of returning
exiles and refugees&mdash;not only from Yakutsk and the
Arctic, but from Chita and the Manchurian border, from the
Baikal mines and the mountain-prisons of the Yablonoi.
In addition, there were German, Austrian, and Hungarian
war-prisoners, drifting slowly westward as the watch
upon them dissolved under the distant rays of Petrograd
revolution; and nomad traders from the Gobi, scraping
profit out of the pains and desires of so many strangers;
and Buryat farmers, rich after years of war-profiteering;
and Cossack officers, still secretly loyal to the old
<i>régime</i>: Irkutsk was a magnet drawing together the whole
assortment, and drawing also influenza and dysentery,
scurvy and typhus, so that the hospitals were choked with
sick, and bodies were thrown, uncoffined and by scores,
into huge open graves dug by patient Chinese.</p>

<p>On a warm August afternoon A.J. wandered about the
Irkutsk railway depot, threading his way amongst the
refugees and listening for a few odd moments to various
political speeches that were being made by soldiers. He
was dressed in a nondescript, vaguely military uniform
which he had acquired at Yakutsk as soon as the cold
weather had begun to recede; he might have been taken for
a Russian soldier, though not, at a second glance, for
a very ordinary one. His fine teeth, spare figure, and
close-cropped hair and beard, would all have marked him
from a majority. His features, lined and rugged, were not
without a look of gentleness and pity; but as he wandered
about the station and freight-yards he seemed really to
have no more than the shadow of any quality; all was
obscured by a look of uncomprehendingness that did not
quite amount to bewilderment.</p>

<p>The seven Cossacks who had been with him for so many
weeks were also on the platform, very dejected because
they had been ordered east, while he, of course, must take
the first train in the other direction, He joined them for
a final meal of tea and black bread before their train
arrived. "You must go to Petrograd," one of them told him
earnestly. "All the exiles are going there to work for the
new government; Kerensky will find you a job&mdash;perhaps
he will make you an inspector of taxes."</p>

<p>"No, no," interrupted another. "Our brother is surely
fitted to be something better than an inspector of
taxes. He has books&mdash;he must be a great scholar; I
should think Kerensky might make him a postmaster, for
a postmaster, after all, has to know how to read and
write."</p>

<p>They argued thus until the train arrived, and A.J.
stayed with them, smiling at their remarks occasionally,
but saying very little. There was a great rush for seats
on the train, and when at last the seven soldiers had all
crowded into a coach they leaned out of the open window and
kissed him&mdash;their captain, their legend, the man whom
they would remember and wonder at until the end of their
lives. And he, when their train had gone, strolled away
still half smiling.</p>

<p>He lay at night, like thousands of others, in any
sheltered corner he could find, with a little bundle of all
his possessions for a pillow. After three more days a train
came in from the east; it was grotesquely full already, but
he managed to find a place in a cattle-truck.</p>

<p>The train was very long, and between the first coach
next to the engine and the last cattle-truck at the rear
the whole world lay in mad microcosm. For the first coach
was a dining-car, smooth-running and luxurious; you could
look through the windows and see military officers,
spattered with gold braid, picking their teeth after fried
chicken and champagne, while attendants in evening-dress
hovered about them obsequiously. Next came the first-class
coach in which these magnates lived when they were not
eating and drinking; and next the second-class coaches,
containing those who were not fortunate enough to be
high military officers; they were not allowed to use
the dining-car, but the attendants would sometimes, at
an extortionate price, supply them with food and drink.
After that carne the third-class coaches, crammed with
soldiers of the Revolution, who bought or commandeered
food at wayside stations; and last, comprising two-thirds
of the whole train, were the cattle-trucks, packed from
floor to roof with refugees and peasants and returning
exiles&mdash;folk who had spent their last paper rouble on
a railway ticket, or else had smuggled themselves on board
with no ticket at all, and who had nothing to eat except
the food they could bargain for, or the ghastly tit-bits
they could rake out of rubbish-bins behind the station
refreshment-rooms.</p>

<p>A.J. spent hours in his corner of the truck, watching
through the slats the constant procession of miles. He was
half oblivious of those about him, of babies who screamed
and were sick, of women who moaned with hunger, of men who
chattered or quarrelled or were noisily companionable. In
a similar way he half noticed the changes that had taken
place since he had last moved over the scene&mdash;the
extraordinary evidences of a new Siberia that had sprung
up ribbon-like along the thin line of the railway, the new
factories and freight-yards, the trams in the streets of
Omsk, the steel bridges that had replaced wooden ones.</p>

<p>The journey was tiring, but worse for others than for
himself, for his body, like his mind, seemed only capable
of half-sensations. For years he had been unaware of
this, but now, in a world of men and women, he perceived
and was puzzled by it; he found himself doing things in
a curious dream-like way, as if part of him were asleep
and were obeying the other part automatically. Even when
he talked, he heard his own voice as if it were another
person speaking; and when he felt tiredness, or hunger,
or a physical ache, the sensation came to him slowly,
incompletely, almost at secondhand.</p>

<p>A fellow-exile tried to converse with him, but received
little encouragement. The man was an ex-university
professor named Triburov&mdash;fat, pompous, and
tremendously eager to reach Petrograd because he knew
many people in the government and felt sure of a good
appointment. He was also extremely annoyed that he had
not been able to find a place for himself and his wife
in the second-or first-class coaches. "Really, the
government ought to arrange things better," he complained
continually.</p>

<p>Madame Triburov, a thin and rather delicate-looking
woman, who had shared the professor's exile for five
years, was suffering acutely from illness and hunger; she
could not eat any of the rough food that was the only kind
obtainable at wayside stations, and every day she grew
weaker and nearer to collapse. Triburov himself, dreaming
bureaucratic dreams, paid little attention to her beyond an
occasional word of perfunctory encouragement; she would be
all right, he kept saying, as soon as they reached the end
of the journey.</p>

<p>One morning the train stopped to load fuel in the midst
of forest country, far from any station or settlement,
and some of the men, glad of the chance to stretch their
legs, climbed out of the trucks and walked about. A.J. and
Triburov were together, and Triburov, as usual, talked
about himself and his future importance and the iniquity of
his having to travel in a cattle-truck. His complaining
increased when they had strolled along the track as far
as the dining-car and could sec its occupants talking,
laughing, and guzzling over an excellent lunch. Seen
through the window from the track-level, the dining-car
presented a vista of large, munching jaws, glittering
epaulettes, and the necks of wine-bottles. One man was
gnawing the leg of a fowl, another was lifting champagne to
his lips, another was puffing at a cigar in full-stomached
contentment. At the far end of the car was the little
kitchen-compartment where the food was cooked and stored;
the window was open and on the shelves could be seen rows
of bottles as well as canned foods, cheeses, and boxes of
biscuits. "All that stuff comes from Japan and America,"
Triburov explained. "They load it on board at Vladivostok
and it lasts all the way to Moscow and back. Excellently
organised, but the scandal is&mdash;" And he resumed his
usual complaint and continued until the engine-whistle
warned them to hasten back to their truck.</p>

<p>That night, when it was almost pitch-dark and his
fellow-travellers were mostly asleep or half-asleep, A.J.
climbed out on to the footboard and began to feel his
way cautiously along the length of the train. His hands
and mind were functioning automatically; half of him was
asking&mdash;'What on earth are you doing?'&mdash;and
the other half was answering&mdash;'I am going to the
dining-car to steal some food for Madame Triburov.' He
did not know why he was doing so; he cared nothing at all
for Madame Triburov; it was no feeling of chivalry, or of
compassion, or of indignation. It was rather a chance idea
that had entered his half-mind&mdash;just an idea that
loomed unwontedly large in a void where there were no other
ideas.</p>

<p>The train was travelling at a moderate speed&mdash;not
more than twenty miles an hour; the night was cloudy and
the fringe of swamps to the side of the track was only to
be dimly perceived. Little could be done by eye as he made
his way from truck to truck; his hands groped for the slats
and his feet for the buffers between one truck and the
next. It was not particularly dangerous progress, provided
one kept one's nerve, and A.J. kept his easily enough; or
rather, in another sense, he had no nerves at all&mdash;he
was simply unaware of fear, terror, joy, triumph, and
all other excitations. His hands and feet did what was
required of them, while his brain looked on with mild
incredulity.</p>

<p>Soon he reached the second-class coaches, in which
candles were glimmering in bottle-necks; and he could
see the occupants asleep&mdash;wealthy traders, bound on
this business or that&mdash;well-dressed women, wives or
mistresses of high officials&mdash;a few military officers
of lower rank. He passed them all and then swung himself
over the buffer-boards to the first-class coach, which
rolled along less noisily on well-greased bogies. Here the
compartments were well upholstered, lit by electricity,
and provided with window-blinds. Many of the latter were
not drawn, however, and A.J. could see officers of high
rank, partially undressed, lying on the cushions with
their mouths gaping in obvious snores. The coach was not
crowded; no compartment held more than two occupants, and
some only one. An especially luxurious coupé with a large
red star pasted on the windows contained a small table and
a comfortable couch on which a man sprawled in sleep. A
military tunic hung on a hook above his head, and in the
far corner of the coupé there was a compact lavatory-basin
and water-tank. Such details fastened themselves with
curious intensity on A.J.'s mind as he made that slow
hand-over-hand journey from window to window. At last he
passed on, over the last set of buffers, to the object of
his pilgrimage&mdash;the dining-car. It was a long, heavy
vehicle belonging to the international company, and at
three in the morning it was, naturally, deserted, with only
a glimmer of light showing from the further end where the
attendants slept in their bunks. A.J. continued his way
along, but this final stage was more difficult because of
the increasing volley of sparks from the engine-chimney.
When he reached the tiny kitchen compartment he was quite
prepared for a climb through the window, with all the
risks it involved of waking the attendants; but fate, at
that last moment, was unexpectedly kind. The window was
still open, and rolls of white bread, tins of American
pork and beans, and wine-bottles lay so accessibly that
he could reach them merely by putting in a hand. He did
so as quickly as he could, filling his pockets, and
then beginning the backward crawl by the same route. It
had taken him, he reckoned, twenty minutes to reach the
dining-car from the truck at the far end of the train,
but he could not hope to accomplish the return journey so
quickly, for his hands were a little numbed and his swollen
pockets impeded movement.</p>

<p>He reached the first-class coach and swung himself on to
it, but the effort, employing a different set of muscles,
made him wince; and when he reached the footboard in safety
he paused to regain strength. Suddenly he realised that he
was standing opposite the window of the coupé and that the
occupant of the couch was sitting up and staring at him.
He began to move on hurriedly, but before he could reach
the next compartment the door of the coupé was flung open
and strong hands seized his wrists. It was impossible to
struggle; the slightest attempt to do so would have meant
his falling backwards to the track, and his arms, too,
were aching after those successive swings from coach to
coach. At first he thought the man was trying to push him
off the train, but soon he realised that the intention was
to drag him inside the coupé. As he could not free himself
and as to be dragged inside was better than to be flung
off, he yielded and the next minute found himself sprawling
on the couch with the door closed and the man above him
flourishing a revolver. He was a tall man with a trim beard
and moustache and an exceedingly good set of teeth; just
now he was snarling with them and punctuating his words
with waves of the revolver. "So!" he cried venomously.
"You try to assassinate me, eh? You creep along by the
windows and shoot while I am asleep, perhaps, eh? Your
friends in Omsk have heard of my promotion and they send
you to execute revenge, no doubt? But instead, it is I who
turn the tables, my friend! Now let me relieve you of your
weapons." He felt in A.J.'s bulging pockets and pulled out,
not the revolver he had expected, but a bottle of wine.
"So!" he snarled, flinging it aside. "A little celebration
after the deed, eh? How disappointed your friends will be!
And especially when they hear you have been shot, also.
For, mistake not, my friend, I will have you shot at the
next station. Assassin! Do you hear that?" He rapidly
went through A.J.'s other pockets, pulling out, to his
increasing surprise, nothing but long rolls of white bread,
pieces of cheese, and tins of food.</p>

<p>All this time A.J. had not spoken a word, but now he
judged it expedient to confess nothing less than the simple
truth. "You see I am not armed," he began. "I am not an
assassin, and I had no intention of making any attack on
you. I have no friends at Omsk, and I did not even know you
were travelling on this train. I am an exile, returning
to Russia, and all I wanted was food. I took these things
from the dining-car and was on my way back with them to the
truck in which I have been travelling from Irkutsk."</p>

<p>The other seemed scarcely mollified by this explanation.
He obviously believed it, but the revelation that he had
been made to suffer such shock and inconvenience by a mere
petty pilferer angered him, if anything, more than the
idea of being assassinated. "A thief, indeed?" he cried
harshly. "You are only a thief, do you say? And you were
only crawling along in the middle of the night to steal
food from the dining-car? Do you know that the food is
all required for high officers of the government? You do,
no doubt; but that did not deter you. Very well, you will
find that the penalty for thieving is just the same. We
behave with fine impartiality, you will find&mdash;thief
or assassin, it does not matter&mdash;all face the firing
squad."</p>

<p>"Some of the refugees in the trucks are starving," said
A.J. slowly.</p>

<p>"Are they, indeed? Then let them starve. Why do they all
want to come crowding on the trains at a time like this?
Let them starve&mdash;the scum&mdash;the country could
well manage with a few millions less of them. And as for
these things&mdash;after your dirty hands have touched
them they are clearly no use at all." And with childish
rage he began to pick them up and throw them out of the
window&mdash;first the bottle of wine, then the rolls, then
the cheese, and lastly the tins.</p>

<p>Something jerked forward in A.J.'s mind at that moment.
As the other stooped to pick up the last tin, he suddenly
hurled himself at the sneering face and flashing teeth,
while his right hand caught hold of the revolver by the
barrel and twisted it back. A.J. was still in a dream, but
it was a different dream, a rising, billowing nightmare. He
saw and heard the revolver slip to the floor, and then he
felt both his hands move to the red, mottled neck in front
of him; he saw the eyes bulge in terror and the snarl of
the teeth transfix into something glittering and rigid.</p>

<p>A moment later he stood by the side of the couch looking
down upon its curious occupant. There was no life now in
the staring eyes and in the twisted limbs.</p>

<p>All at once it occurred to him: he had killed the
fellow. He had not intended to&mdash;or <i>had</i> he? Yet
no&mdash;there was hardly such a thing as intention in him.
It had just happened; the sight of the food disappearing
through the window had set up some unwonted electrical
contact between mind and body.</p>

<p>He tried to think what to do next, and his mind
worked with icy clearness, as in a vacuum. The dead man
had clearly been a person of importance, and that meant
certain death for his slayer. Assuming, of course, that
the latter were discovered. But need he be? Was there a
chance of escape? No one had seen him so far; the blinds
of the windows next to the corridor were drawn and the
corridor-door was fastened on the inside. He must, of
course, hasten back to the cattle-truck and feign sleep;
his absence might or might not have been particularly
noticed, but perhaps he would be safe if he could return
unobtrusively. At the next station, he knew, there would
be a huge commotion, with probably the most minute
examinations and cross-questionings of everybody in the
train.</p>

<p>He was just about to open the door of the coupe and
begin a swift return journey along the footboards, when he
heard a tap at the corridor-door. "Tarkarovsk in fifteen
minutes' time, sir," came the voice of the train-attendant.
After a pause the message was repeated, and then A.J.
managed to stammer out "All right." He heard the attendant
move away and tap at other doors along the corridor with
the same message&mdash;"Tarkarovsk in fifteen minutes'
time, sir."</p>

<p>And that, unfortunately, settled it. He could not return
to the truck; it had taken him twenty minutes to make the
forward journey, and it was impossible to think of doubling
his rate on the way back. Besides, the train attendant's
warning would waken the passengers in the compartments;
they would be sitting up and yawning, and would certainly
see him if he passed their windows. The only alternative
seemed to be a risky jump off the train and an escape
across country, though his position would be desperate
enough even then. Tarkarovsk was dangerously near; the
body would be discovered quite soon; within an hour the
surrounding country would be swarming with armed searchers.
Nor, among those open, desolate swamps, could a fugitive
hope to elude pursuers for long.</p>

<p>Then suddenly his mind alighted on a third
possibility&mdash;fantastic, almost incredible, yet not,
in such circumstances, to be rejected too scornfully.
After all, one way, and perhaps the best way, in which a
culprit might avoid discovery was by contriving that his
crime should not be discovered either. A.J. looked at the
dead man, then at the tunic hanging above him; and all at
once his mind began arranging the future with astonishing
precision. Yet there was no astonishment in the way he
accepted every detail of an amazing scheme. He was cool,
almost slow, in his movements. First he stripped the body
of the dead man. Next he undressed himself and put on the
dead man's clothes. After that he dressed the body in his
own discarded garments. Then opening the door of the coupé,
he hurled the clothed body as far away from the track as
he could. With luck it might sink into a swamp and never
be discovered at all, but even without luck, it was hardly
likely to attract much attention in such circumstances as
he would arrange. Refugees and peasants often fell out of
trains; several bodies had been noticed on the way from
Irkutsk, but no one had thought of stopping to identify or
examine them.</p>

<p>After reclosing the door of the coupé, he washed in
the lavatory-basin and completed his toilet. The other
man's uniform fitted him very well indeed, as did also the
military top-boots. The brakes were already grinding on the
wheels as he pulled down the window-blinds, half lay down
on the couch, took up a magazine that was on the table,
and closed his eyes. If anyone opened the door from the
platform it would appear that he had fallen asleep whilst
reading.</p>

<p>The rest of his scheme was comparatively simple, if only
he could escape attention at Tarkarovsk. Between Tarkarovsk
and the next station there was almost sure to be some
suitable spot where, before dawn, he could jump from the
train and slip away across country. The disappearance of a
high officer would create a stir, but only eventually; it
would be more natural first of' all to assume that any one
of a dozen minor mischances could account for it.</p>

<p>The train jerked and jangled to a
standstill&mdash;Tarkarovsk&mdash;Tarkarovsk. A sound of
shouting reached him from outside and then the scurry of
footsteps running along the platform as the train halted.
He did not think Tarkarovsk was a very large place, but
of course even the smallest stations were crowded with
refugees. Suddenly sharper cries pierced the general din,
and the door of the coupé opened violently to admit an
intruder very different from any A.J. had anticipated.
He was of small stature and corpulent, was dressed in a
black frock-coat and trousers, and carried a rather shabby
top-hat. "Welcome, sir!" he cried, making a profound bow.
"As chairman of the local council of Khalinsk, I bring
you the town's most gracious felicitations." A.J. rose
in astonishment, whereupon the other, smiling and still
bowing, took hold of his hand and gave it a tremendous
shaking. The dream in which A.J. had been living for so
long turned a corner now and swept into the infinite
corridors of another dream. Somehow or other he found
himself stepping out of the train; porters immediately
entered it and began lifting out quantities of luggage.
Other men in frock-coats and top-hats were presented to
him, and he heard the little man saying sweetly: "The cars
are waiting outside, sir, if you are ready." He walked
across the platform and out into the courtyard, where a
huge Benz was waiting. He got in; several frock-coats
followed him; the luggage was packed into a second car
behind. Then the two cars lurched forward along a dusty
uneven road. He did not speak, but his companions,
evidently thinking he was very sleepy, commiserated with
him on the inconvenience of arriving at a country railway
station at half-past three in the morning. Soon the road
widened into the typically Siberian town of Tarkarovsk.
The cars pulled up outside the small hotel, and A.J. was
informed that a room had been engaged for him and that he
could take a rest, if he chose, until breakfast, after
which the journey to Khalinsk would be resumed. He gave
rather vague thanks and said the arrangement would suit him
very well. The frock-coats conducted him upstairs to his
room with obsequious gestures and then went drown again,
he guessed, to have many drinks and much gossip about
himself.</p>

<p><i>About himself</i>&mdash;that was the question. Who was
he? Who was he supposed to be? Why was he being taken to
Khalinsk? And why the finery of a frock-coated railway
station reception at such an hour? Then, alone in the
rather dingy bedroom as the first light of dawn paled
against the edges of the window-blinds, it occurred to him
that the contents of his pockets might afford a clue. He
examined them; he found a thick wallet containing a large
sum in paper money and several official documents. One was
a letter from Petrograd addressed to a Colonel Nikolay
Andreyev, of Krasnoyarsk, appointing him Commissar of the
town and district of Khalinsk, Western Siberia. And another
was from the local council of Khalinsk, tendering their
best respects and expressing sincere appreciation of' the
privilege conferred on them by the Petrograd government.
A.J. read them through, put them back in the wallet, and
then sat on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands.
He was still in his dark dream, and he dared not try to
waken. There was no help for it; from the moment the
frock-coat had entered the train at Tarkarovsk, a third
identity had descended on him like a sealed doom.</p>

<p>So he became Nikolay Andreyev, Commissar of Khalinsk,
and he began to wonder whether he would be fortunate
enough to arrange an escape before he was found out. As it
chanced, it became increasingly impossible to arrange an
escape; but then, on the other hand, he was not found out.
Both time and place were, in fact, especially favourable
to the impersonation; Khalinsk was a small town, well
away from the main avenues of Siberian communication,
and too remote at first even to be affected seriously by
the Revolution itself. Most of its inhabitants, some ten
thousand or so in number, were quietly and prosperously
bourgeois; the surrounding district provided abundant food,
and though the usual exchange of exports and imports with
European Russia had been impeded, that had meant to the
folk of Khalinsk no greater privations than a shortage
of cotton-thread and Ford motor parts, and the necessity
to use their best butter as axle-grease for farm-wagons.
Khalinsk, indeed, was a little island of normality in the
midst of a rising sea of chaos, and its new Commissar
fitted into its peaceful scheme of things without much
difficulty. Everyone agreed that he was a 'queer' man
with 'queer' ways, but most were glad, in their bourgeois
hearts, that Petrograd had not sent them a fire-eater.
About a week after his arrival news came that his wife
and child had died of typhus in Vladivostok, and Khalinsk
people felt much sympathy for the quiet, rarely-speaking
man who had to sit in his office signing travel-passes
while his family were buried at the other end of a
continent. When someone ventured to express that sympathy,
all he received was a patient 'Thank you&mdash;it is most
kind of you'&mdash;courteously given, but somehow not an
encouragement to continue.</p>

<p>Once a visitor to Khalinsk who had known of Colonel
Andreyev in Krasnoyarsk commented that he would hardly have
recognised him for the same man. "He was a wild fellow in
those days&mdash;always ready to crack a joke&mdash;or
another man's head, for that matter. And now look at
him!"</p>

<p>Khalinsk looked at him quite often, for the commissary
office was in the centre of the town, adjoining the
court-house and the prison, and the Commissar walked
between his office and his hotel four times a day. In
the hotel he had rooms of his own and took all his meals
in private. But Khalinsk people could see him in their
streets, and behind his desk whenever they had business
with him; he presided, too, in the local courthouse, and
paid official visits to the prison. His justice was firm,
and the town's young bloods soon learned that they could
play no tricks with the new ruler; yet it was noticed
and commented upon that in court he always looked as if
he were only half attending and didn't really care what
happened.</p>

<p>His subordinates respected him, with the possible
exception of Kashvin, the assistant commissar. Kashvin, a
local youth of considerable intelligence, felt that the
Petrograd authorities had needlessly superseded him in
bringing Andreyev from Krasnoyarsk, and he was the more
antagonistic to his superior because he could not, with all
his shrewdness, understand him. The two men, indeed, were
complete opposites. Kashvin was cordial, unscrupulous, an
astute observer of politics, and an impassioned orator.
Probably, too, he was clever enough to foresee that power
at Petrograd would eventually pass into the hands of
extremists. During the autumn the normally easy-going life
of Khalinsk did very rapidly deteriorate; a garrison of
soldiers arrived from Europe with new and wilder doctrines;
they were hardly willing to obey their own officers, much
less a local commissar. Great excitement, also, had been
caused by the establishment, in custody, of the ex-Emperor
and his family at Tobolsk, a few hundred miles away.
Throughout October conditions grew more and more turbulent,
and it was clear that the situation in Petrograd was
already slipping out of the hands of the moderates. Then
in November came news of the Bolshevik revolution, and an
immediate acceleration in Khalinsk and all such places of
the trend already in progress.</p>

<p>Even Kashvin found it increasingly difficult to keep his
balance on the political tight-rope. Following a custom
beginning to be prevalent, the soldiers had got rid of
their officers and had elected others from their own ranks;
unfortunately, however, they obeyed their elected superiors
no better than anyone else. Kashvin's loudest oratory could
not persuade them to cease their plundering raids into the
town shops. Andreyev did not try the oratorical method;
he collected a few personal supporters and made arrests.
Sternness succeeded for a while, until, quite suddenly,
the blow was struck. While the Commissar was sitting at
the courthouse one morning in January, the building was
surrounded by soldiers and a spokesman entered to deliver
an ultimatum. The soldiers, he announced, wished to choose
their own commissar as well as their own officers; they
had been in communication with Petrograd and had received
official support; so would, therefore, the Commissar
kindly consent to consider himself no longer a commissar
until a vote had been taken? Most observers expected
Andreeyev to give a sharp answer, but, to general surprise,
he merely smiled (which he so rarely did) and replied:
"Certainly&mdash;with pleasure." The vote was taken there
and then, and Kashvin was elected Commissar, with Andreeyev
as his civilian assistant. Again it was expected that the
latter would indignantly refuse to serve under his recent
subordinate, but Andreeyev continued to give surprise by
his easy acceptance of the situation. And, indeed, the
reversal of position made more difference in theory than
in fact. Kashvin, though nominally in authority, was
completely at the mercy of his military supporters, while
Andreeyev, exactly as before, continued his patient work
of issuing ration-cards, arranging for the distribution of
food and fuel, and making out travel-passes.</p>

<p>During the early months of the new year the position
at Khalinsk was still worsening. The nearness of Tobolsk,
with its illustrious prisoners, brought to the district a
heavy influx of revolutionary and counter-revolutionary
spies, German and Allied secret agents, and freelance
adventurers of all kinds. Tobolsk was their goal, but
Khalinsk was a safer place for plotting. Half the pedlars
and market-dealers were in the service of one or other
organisation, and every day brought new and more startling
rumours. In March a regiment of the new Red Army arrived
from Yekaterinburg to relieve the older men who had already
served through most of the Siberian winter. Many were
criminals freshly released from European prisons; the best
of them were miners and factory-workers lured into the
army by generous pay and rations. They were all completely
undisciplined and changed their officers with monotonous
regularity.</p>

<p>Towards the end of March the long succession of rumours
did at length culminate in something actual. Late one night
the telephone-bell rang in the commissary office; A.J.,
who was there working, answered it; the call came from
a post-house half-way between Khalinsk and the railway.
The message reported that there were rumours that the
Trans-Siberian line had been cut by White guards, assisted
by Czecho-Slovak prisoners-of-war.</p>

<p>A.J., tired after a long day of wrestling with the
complications of a new rationing system, took no particular
notice, since such scare messages arrived almost regularly
two or three nights a week. But a quarter of an hour later
another message came&mdash;this time from Tarkarovsk; no
train, it said, had arrived from the east since noon, and
there were rumours that counterrevolution had broken out at
Omsk. A.J. rang through to the garrison but could get no
answer; Kashvin, he guessed, would be in bed and asleep;
he walked, therefore, a mile or so over the hard snow to
the soldiers' barracks. He found the place in a state of
utter chaos and pandemonium, with all the officers more or
less drunk and incapable. Most of the men were in a similar
condition; it was a saint's day, and by way of celebration
they had looted several wine-cellars in the town. A.J.
tried to make known the dangerous possibilities of the
situation, and while he was actually in the officers' room
there came a further telephone message from Pokroyevensk,
ten miles away, conveying the brief information that
counter-revolutionary bands had occupied and plundered
a neighbouring village. At this a few of the officers
struggled to rouse themselves, and men were hastily sent
to the armoury for rifles and ammunition. Meanwhile orders
were given for a general turn-out, but out of nearly
a thousand men only two hundred could be equipped for
whatever emergency might arise. Hundreds were so drunk
that they could not stir from the floors on which they had
collapsed; many also were sleeping with women in the town
and could not be reached at all.</p>

<p>A.J. himself took a rifle and a belt of cartridges,
and soon after midnight the detachment, in charge of an
officer, set out along the gleaming snow-bound road. The
cold air soon cleared the drink-sodden heads of the men,
and they stepped out at a good pace in the direction of
Pokroyevensk. Ruffians though most of them were, A.J.
found them almost pathetically companionable and full
of amazement that he, a civilian commissar, should be
accompanying them. Surely, as a government official, it was
his privilege&mdash;his perquisite, as it were&mdash;to
keep out of all serious danger?</p>

<p>He smiled and answered that he had come because he knew
the district very well&mdash;the roads, directions, and
so on. It would not matter his temporarily deserting the
office-desk; there was Kashvin in charge. And at this the
men laughed. Though they loved to let themselves be stirred
by Kashvin's eloquence, a moment such as this brought out
their secret contempt for the man whose tongue was so much
mightier than his sword.</p>

<p>During the first hour the men sang songs&mdash;not
spirited marching songs, but dragging, rather melancholy
refrains that seemed to be known by all. One was 'Far away
and over the marshes'&mdash;a weird recitative about exile;
another favourite was 'A Soldier lays down his Life.' Into
these slow, crooning tunes the men somehow contrived to
insert a strange ghost of rhythm, hardly noticeable to the
listener, yet sufficient to keep them in rough, plodding
step. After the first few miles, however, A.J. suggested
that they had better march in silence, since voices carried
far in that still, cold atmosphere. The men obeyed him,
not instantly as from a military order, but with a gradual
trail of voices from high melody to the faintest murmur
amongst themselves. The officer who should have had the wit
to give the order was staggering along, still very drunk.
The men said tranquilly that it was because he was not
satisfied to get drunk like other men; he dosed himself
with a sort of yeast-paste which produced more permanent
effects.</p>

<p>The remaining events of that night might serve as
a model for much that was happening and that was yet
to happen throughout the vast territory between the
Pacific and the Vistula. All the typical ingredients were
present&mdash;confusion, rumour, inconsequence, surprise.
To begin with, at Pokroyevensk, which was reached about
three in the morning, the officer in charge suddenly
collapsed and died. A.J. telephoned the news to Khalinsk
and gathered that the town was in the wildest panic;
rumours of an overwhelming White advance along the line of
the Trans-Siberian were being received, and the garrison
was already preparing to evacuate the town. This seemed
to A.J. the sheerest absurdity as well as cowardice, but
he could not argue the matter over the wire with a person
who, from the sound of his voice, was still half-drunk. He
determined, if the soldiers were willing (for of course
he had no real authority over them), to march on to the
railway and tear up a few lengths of line&mdash;the
usual and most effective way of delaying an advance. The
men agreed to this plan, and were just about to leave
Pokroyevensk, when a mortifying discovery was made. The
ammunition that they carried would not fit the rifles,
the former being of French pattern, while the latter were
Japanese. Similar mistakes, the men said, had often been
made during the war against the Germans. It meant, of
course, that the detachment was practically unarmed, and
A.J. could see nothing for it but to return to Khalinsk
as quickly as possible. But then something else happened.
In the grim light of dawn a band of White guards swept
suddenly into the village along the frozen road from the
west; there were several hundred of them, all fully armed
and all in a mood to wreak terrible havoc upon a small
village. They were not, however, prepared for A.J. and
his couple of hundred men. Still less was A.J. prepared
for them. He realised that a fight would be hopeless, and
rather than have all his followers shot to pieces he would
prefer to surrender; he had none of the more spectacular
heroic virtues, and conceived that a soldier's aim should
be to preserve his own life at least as much as to destroy
his enemy's. As it chanced, however, the White captain
thought similarly, and was, moreover, a little quicker
in action. He surrendered to A.J. a few seconds before
the latter could possibly have reversed the compliment.
It was amusing, in a way, to see four or five hundred
well-armed Whites surrendering to less than half as many
Reds who could not, if they had tried, have fired a shot.
The White captain explained that he was not really a very
convinced White; he had always, in fact, inclined to be a
little pink. Some of the White soldiers raised cheers for
the Soviets. A.J. nodded gravely; the procedure was very
familiar.</p>

<p>More important than the White soldiers was a party of
civilians whom they had been escorting. These were various
personages, more or less illustrious, who had escaped from
European Russia and were hoping to cross Siberia and reach
America. They had travelled disguised as far as Tarkarovsk
and had there given themselves into the hands of a White
detachment which, in return for an enormous bribe, had
undertaken to get them through to Omsk.</p>

<p>A.J. was in no doubt as to his proper course of action.
Such a distinguished party must be conveyed to Khalinsk
and held as hostages. He arranged this promptly, after
arming his men with the rifles taken from the White
soldiers. Khalinsk was reached by noon, and by that time
the atmosphere was completely changed; the Whites had
everywhere been defeated, and Red reinforcements were
already arriving from Yekaterinburg. A.J.'s prisoners
were examined and locked away in the town jail, with the
exception of most of the soldiers, who were permitted
to join the Red army. In the reaction that followed the
excitements of the whole episode A.J. felt a certain
bewildered helplessness; all was such confusion,
incoherence, chaos&mdash;a game played in the dark, with
Fate as a blind umpire. The chapter of accidents found
itself interpreted as a miracle of intrepid organisation,
with A.J. as the hero of the hour. Even Kashvin
congratulated him. "I would have accompanied you myself,"
he explained, "but as Commissar, it would have been
improper for me to leave the town. Now tell me, Andreeyev,
do you think it would be better to ask for Japanese
ammunition to fit he rifles or for French rifles to fit
the ammunition?" He then showed A.J. a few reports he had
drafted and which were to be telegraphed away immediately.
They were all circumstantially detailed accounts of
atrocities committed by White guards&mdash;women raped,
babies speared on the ends of bayonets, wounded men
tortured to death, and so on. Kashvin seemed extremely
proud of the collection. "But surely," A.J. said, "you
can't have received proof of all this in so short a time?"
Kashvin replied cheerfully: "Oh no&mdash;they are my own
invention entirely; don't you think they read very well?
After all, since we have no rifles and ammunition for the
present, we must do what we can with moral weapons."</p>

<p>And, as it further chanced, the Whites <i>had</i> committed
atrocities, though less ingeniously than Kashvin had
imagined. The Reds, too, were not without a natural lust
for vengeance. Hundreds of prosperous local inhabitants
were thrown into prisons on charges of having been in
sympathy with the White insurrectionists; wholesale raids
and arrests were made, and the Khalinsk prison was soon
quite full. Meanwhile in the town itself all semblance of
civilian authority vanished. A strongly Red local Soviet
was appointed by the soldiers; Kashvin, despite prodigies
of oratory and private manoeuvre, was deposed from office
and a Jewish agitator named Baumberg took his place. A.J.
was allowed to remain as assistant-commissar because he
was personally popular and because nobody else either
wanted or was capable of performing his various jobs. These
jobs now vastly increased, especially as food grew less
plentiful and disease broke out in the overcrowded prison
and barracks. Baumberg was a loud-voiced, heavy-featured
Pole whose ferocity in public was only rivalled by an
uncanny mildness in private life. At the age of twenty he
had been accused (falsely, he said) of killing a gendarme;
he had thenceforward spent twenty years in a military
fortress and twenty more in exile at Missen, in the
desolate tundra region of North Russia. Now, at sixty, he
was being given his opportunity for revenge, and he was
having no mercy. His ruthlessness gratified the soldiers,
and his speeches, sincerer if no more extreme than those
of Kashvin, were constant incitements to violence. Yet
he was a pleasant person compared with the military
commandant, an ex-railwayman named Vronstein. Vronstein
was a psycho-pathological curiosity; he, too, had been
long in exile, and its results had been an astounding
assortment of perversions. Even his sadism was perverted;
when prisoners were punished or shot he would never watch
the scene himself, but would insist that a full and
detailed report, complete with every horror, was submitted
to him in writing. Over such reports he would savagely and
secretly gloat for hours. Baumberg openly despised him, but
there was a sinister power about the fellow which gave him
considerable hold over the soldiers.</p>

<p>Among the commissary duties was that of visiting the
prison and prison hospital, which were now under the
control of the local Soviet. Both were small and crammed
with White prisoners, most of whom were sullenly resigned
to whatever fate might be in store for them. A few were
defiant, exulting in the still-expected breakdown of the
Revolution. Almost every day fresh arrivals were brought
in by Red guards, and&mdash;as it were, to make room for
them&mdash;others were removed by Baumberg's orders, taken
to the military camp, and shot. Baumberg never explained on
what system he selected his victims; perhaps, indeed, he
had no system at all. His ferocity was coldly impersonal;
when he had done his day's duty, including perhaps the
ordering of half a dozen shootings for the morrow, he would
go home to his daughter, who kept house for him, and play
noisy capering games with his fatherless grand-children.</p>

<p>The White prisoners included a score or more women,
who were lodged separately in a large overcrowded room.
This was a thoroughly unsatisfactory arrangement, since
the room was badly needed as a supplementary hospital
ward for the male prisoners, many of whom were sick and
wounded. Baumberg, though he would have scorned any idea
of sex-distinction, did not in fact have any of the women
shot, and was willing enough to allow the majority of
them to be transferred to Omsk, where the prison was
larger. This only stipulated exceptions were the two most
distinguished captives, whom he wished to keep at Khalinsk,
and who, after the departure of the rest, were transferred
to separate cells. Both had been captured by A.J.'s men
in the affair at Pokroyevensk. The Countess Vandarova was
one, and A.J., who had the job of visiting her from time
to time, soon recommended her transference to hospital,
since she was clearly going out of her mind. The other
woman prisoner was the Countess Marie Alexandra Adraxine.
She was of a different type; calm, exquisitely dignified,
she accepted favours and humiliations alike with slightly
mocking nonchalance. When A.J. first visited her, she said:
"Ah, Commissar, we have met before, I think? That morning
at Pokroyevensk&mdash;I dare say you remember?"</p>

<p>He said: "I have come to ask if you have any particular
complaints&mdash;is your food satisfactory, and so on?"</p>

<p>"Oh, fairly so, in the circumstances. My chief wish is
that there were fewer bugs in my mattress."</p>

<p>"I will try to see that you have a fresh one, though
of course I cannot promise that it will be perfectly
clean."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not fastidious&mdash;don't think that." She
went to the narrow mattress by the wall of the cell and
gave it a blow with her clenched fist. After a second or so
a slowly spurting-red cascade issued from every rent and
seam. "You see?" she said. "It's the trivial things that
really bother one most, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The second time he paid her cell an official visit
she thanked him for having replaced the mattress by a
comparatively unverminous one. Then she said: "Have you any
idea what is going to happen to me, Commissar?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "It is altogether a matter for others
to decide."</p>

<p>"You think I shall be shot?"</p>

<p>"No women have been shot as yet."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, it is possible?"</p>

<p>"Oh, perfectly."</p>

<p>"Would you approve?"</p>

<p>"I should not be asked either to approve or to
disapprove."</p>

<p>She seemed amused by his attitude. After that he did
not again visit her alone, for he did not care to be asked
questions which he could not answer.</p>

<p>As spring advanced it could be foreseen that events in
the district were hastening to a further crisis. Along
the whole length of the Trans-Siberian the Czecho-Slovak
prisoners-of-war, whom the Petrograd government had
promised a safe journey to Vladivostok, had seized trains
and station depots. This comparatively small body of men,
stretched out in tenuous formation for four thousand miles,
was practically in possession of Siberia, and there was
talk that the Allies, instead of letting them proceed
across the Pacific, intended to use them to break the
Soviets and re-form the eastern front against Germany.
Simultaneously the forces of counter-revolution were again
massing for an attack. In April the Reds began to send
important political prisoners away from the endangered
districts; the ex-Emperor was removed from Tobolsk for an
unknown destination. From Khalinsk there would doubtless
have been a big exodus but for a dispute between the
district commissars of Tobolsk and Yekaterinburg as to
who held authority over the town. Baumberg favoured
Yekaterinburg; Vronstein preferred Siberian rule. A hot
quarrel arose between the two officials, broken only by
intermittent shootings that both could agree upon.</p>

<p>At last came news that Omsk itself had been taken by
the counter-revolutionaries. Khalinsk was then caught up
in another sudden scurry of panic; military and civilian
authority both made preparations to evacuate the town;
stores and ammunition were packed and sent away west;
and Baumberg's speeches grew more and more tumultuous.
Kashvin's invented atrocity stories now began to trickle
back with many elaborations; they drove the Red garrison
to the highest pitch of fury, and this, in the absence of
any convenient battlefield enemy, was vented upon the White
captives in the prison.</p>

<p>One night the quarrelling between Baumberg and Vronstein
came to a head. Difficulties had arisen over the provision
of transport for sending certain of the prisoners to safer
places&mdash;safer, that was, from White capture. Rather
than run the risk of any being rescued by their friends,
Vronstein was for a wholesale massacre; but this was too
much for Baumberg. The two stormed and threatened each
other, Vronstein declaring in the end that he would march
at the head of his soldiers and take the prison by storm.
As soon as he had left the commissary office, Baumberg
turned to A.J. in his suddenly normal and placid way and
said: "I do believe the fellow means it. He'll have them
all murdered before the night's out. Andreeyev, I think
you ought to go to the prison and get out the two women.
Petrograd will be furious if they are slaughtered by those
drunken hogs." He added, a little pompously: "The women are
both very important links in the chain of evidence against
the enemies of the Revolution, and I have already received
strict orders that they are to be taken care of. When the
counterrevolution has been crushed, they are to be put on
trial in Petrograd&mdash;I tell you that in confidence, of
course."</p>

<p>It was almost midnight when A.J. reached the prison.
Even so soon there was in the atmosphere a queer feeling
of impending terror; the prison-guards were nervous and
inclined to question his authority. It was obvious that
most of them, if only to save their own skins, would join
with the soldiers in whatever bloodthirsty orgy was to
ensue. A.J. sought Countess Vandarova first; she was kept
in an outlying part of the prison under semi-hospital
conditions. As soon as the warder unlocked her door she
sprang screaming out of bed and crouched in the furthest
corner of the cell. A.J. began: "Do not alarm yourself,
Countess, but get ready to move away at once. You are to
be taken elsewhere." Then, as he saw the warder's eyes
upon him, he knew that he had blundered. In the hurry of
the moment he had called her 'Countess'. Commissars had
been degraded and private soldiers shot, he knew, for less
than that. Perturbed by the possible results of his slip,
he went on to the other woman's cell. She was asleep and
had to be awakened. He gave her the same message, but with
careful omission of the forbidden word.</p>

<p>Waiting in the prison-hall for the two women to
present themselves, he could hear the sound of shouting
and rifle-fire from the barracks not far away. Intense
nervousness had by this time communicated itself to warders
and prisoners alike; all were wide awake and chattering,
and A.J. wondered what might be in store for them during
the next few hours.</p>

<p>Countess Adraxine appeared first; she had put over her
shoulders a light travelling cloak that still retained a
trace of its original fashionableness, and she carried a
few personal belongings in a small bundle. In the presence
of the guards he did not speak to her; they waited for
a moment in silence, and then he despatched one of the
guards to fetch Countess Vandarova. A little later the
guard returned with the astonishing news that the woman was
dead. A.J. rushed to her cell; it was true. Mad with terror
at the thought that she was to be taken away and shot,
the woman had killed herself by a desperate and rather
difficult method: she had stabbed herself repeatedly in the
throat with an ordinary safety-pin, and had died from shock
and loss of blood.</p>

<p>A.J. was a little paler when he rejoined the other
prisoner. There was no time to be lost, and accompanied by
guards the two hurried out of the prison and across the
town-square to the commissary office. Baumberg was waiting;
he had heard of the suicide by telephone and was in a fine
fury. The Petrograd authorities would hold him responsible;
how was it that the woman had been allowed to have in her
possession such a dangerous weapon as a safety-pin; and
much else that was extreme and absurd. Then, with one of
those sudden returns to mildness that were such an odd
trait in his character, he handed his assistant a sheaf
of papers. "You are to take the remaining prisoner to
Moscow, Andreeyev; there you will hand her over to the
authorities. Two guards will go with you. Here are all the
necessary papers; you will board the first train west from
Tarkarovsk. The horses are waiting outside&mdash;you must
set out instantly, for the latest news is that the Whites
are advancing quickly along the line from Omsk."</p>

<p>In the courtyard of the office building stood a couple
of <i>tarantassy</i>&mdash;the ordinary Siberian conveyance
which, badly sprung and yoked to relays of horses, would
sometimes accomplish the journey to Tarkarovsk in five or
six hours. There was a small moon shining, and a sky of
starlight. The roads, after the grip of winter, were on
the point of thawing; in a few days they would be choked
with mud. A.J., clad in a heavy soldier's greatcoat and fur
cap, superintended the stowing away of the luggage into the
first vehicle, which, driven by one of the guards, pulled
out into the deserted street and clattered away south
towards one o'clock in the morning. A few minutes later
the second <i>tarantass</i> followed; A.J. and the woman sat
together in the back of the swaying, rickety vehicle, while
the other guard drove.</p>

<p>In the commissary yard A.J. had spoken a few words to
his prisoner&mdash;formal courtesies and so on, but as soon
as the journey began he relapsed into silence. He was, to
begin with, physically tired; he had been working at more
than normal pressure for weeks, and now reaction was on
him. Apart from that, the stir of Countess Vandarova's
death and the sudden unfolding of a new future gave him a
certain weariness of mind; he felt too mentally fatigued to
realise what was happening. Fortunately, fatigue drove away
anxiety; he felt again as if he were living in the midst of
some vague and curious dream, full of happenings over which
he had no control and with which, in any major sense, he
was completely unconcerned. He was, he supposed, bound for
Moscow, yet how and even whether he would ever get there
did not seem in the least important. He had a pocketful
of documents stamped with all the official seals and
signatures Baumberg had been able to commandeer, but he had
no confidence that they were worth more than the paper they
were written on. The ex-Emperor, it was rumoured, had been
seized by the local Soviet at Yekaterinburg in defiance
of official orders; things like that were constantly
happening; anything, indeed, might happen. The only course
was to drift onwards, somehow or other, inside this busy
dream, always ready, in an emergency, to grope into a
wakefulness that was but another dream of another kind.</p>

<p>Steadily through the night the horses galloped over the
softening earth. Only once was anything said, and that
was at Pokroyevensk, where the horses were changed and
rumours were shared with the local telegraph official.
The latest report was that Tarkarovsk had already fallen
to the Whites. A.J., with better knowledge of distances,
did not credit this, but it was futile to argue. As the
journey was resumed, the woman said: "So you are going on
to Tarkarovsk, Commissar?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But if the Whites hold the place, that means we shall
be running into them?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Only I don't believe they do hold it."</p>

<p>"What would happen if they did?"</p>

<p>"You would be freed and I should be shot, most
probably."</p>

<p>"Whereas, if all goes well and we get to Moscow safely,
it is <i>I</i> who will be shot?"</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"You strike the Napoleonic attitude rather well,
Commissar."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, I am not striking any attitude at all. I am
merely very tired&mdash;really too tired to talk."</p>

<p>After that she said nothing.</p>

<p>He was right; Tarkarovsk was still Red, though the town
and district were being rapidly prepared for evacuation.
The two jolting vehicles drove up to the railway station
towards dawn, after a journey of nightmare weariness. Hour
after hour the Commissar and his prisoner had been bumped
along over the interminable Siberian plain, and now, at
the station, with limbs sore and aching, they had to begin
the next and perhaps more arduous task of finding scats on
the train. The station was swarming with refugees from the
surrounding country, most of them in a pitiable condition,
and all frantically anxious to be out of the way when the
White troops should enter. There had been no trains since
the previous evening, though several were rumoured to be on
their way. The stationmaster bowed respectfully when A.J.
presented his papers; yes, he should certainly be given a
compartment in the next train, but would there be any next
train&mdash;that was the real question? "I cannot, you see,
invent a train, Commissar&mdash;not being God, that is to
say." A.J. detected a slight impertinence behind the man's
outward obsequiousness. Of course the Whites were coming
and the Reds were leaving; the fellow was adroitly trimming
his sails to catch the new wind.</p>

<p>Throughout the hardships of the journey and now amidst
the throng and scurry of the railway platform, the woman
prisoner preserved a calm that had in it still that same
slight touch of mockery. Of course it was not her place to
worry about the train or the White advance; if the latter
arrived before the former, the advantage would all be
hers. She could afford to watch with equanimity and even
exultation the growing congestion of the station precincts
and the increasing anxiety on the faces of the two Red
guards. Yet for all that, her attitude was no more than
calm; it was as if she were neither hoping nor fearing
anything at all. She sat on her bundle of possessions and
watched the frantic pageant around her with a sleepy,
almost mystical detachment. Even when, at three in the
afternoon, the stationmaster came shouting the news that
the train was arriving after all, she did not move or
betray by a murmur that the matter concerned her; and this
attitude, because it so queerly accorded with his own,
stirred in A.J. a slight and puzzled attention.</p>

<p>The train arrived at half-past four, already full, with
Red soldiers and refugees crouching between and on the
roofs of the coaches. The two guards, doubtfully assisted
by the stationmaster, opened the door of a second-class
compartment (there was no first-class on the train) and
drove its occupants on to the platform at the point of the
revolver. They were refugees from Omsk, and pity for them
was tempered with indignation at the horrible state in
which they had left the compartment. They had ripped up the
cushioned seats to make puttees to wind round their legs;
they had scattered filth of every description all over
the floor; and they (or some previous occupants) had also
stripped the compartment bare of every detachable object.
The two guards worked for half an hour to make the place
habitable, and even then its interior atmosphere was still
unpleasant.</p>

<p>The train left Tarkarovsk about dusk and crawled slowly
westward. A.J., his prisoner, and the guards made a frugal
breakfast of coffee and black bread. Both guards were
huge fellows&mdash;one of a typical peasant type, and the
other of superior intelligence but less likeable. As for
the prisoner, her attitude remained exactly the same. At
the first station west of Tarkarovsk news came that the
Whites were on the point of entering that town; the train
had apparently escaped by only the narrowest of margins.
Yet the woman betrayed no suspicion of disappointment.
She obeyed all A.J.'s requests with unassuming calmness;
she sat where he told her to sit, ate when he told her to
eat, and so on. He had now time to notice her appearance.
She was perhaps under thirty years of age, though her type
was that whose years are difficult to guess. Her hair
was smooth and jet-black, framing a face of considerable
beauty. Her lips had the clean, accurate curvings of the
thoroughbred, and her eyes, when they were in repose, held
a rather sleepy, mystical look. And she was not only calm;
she was calming.</p>

<p>Towards evening the train reached Yekaterinburg.
The Ural mountain city, noted for its extreme brand of
revolutionary sentiment, was in a state of wild excitement,
and for two reasons&mdash;the White advance along the
railway, and the murder of the ex-Emperor that had taken
place a few nights before. The station was packed with
Red soldiers, and from their looks as the train sailed
past their faces to a standstill, A.J. did not anticipate
pleasant encounters. The first thing that happened was
the invasion of the compartment by a dozen or so of them,
extravagantly armed and more than half drunk. The two
guards wisely made no attempt to resist, but A.J. said,
authoritatively: "I am a Commissar on my way to Moscow
on important government business. This compartment is
reserved for me." His manner of speaking was one which
usually impressed, and most of the invaders, despite their
ruffianism, would probably have retired but for one of
them, a swaggering little Jew about five feet high, who
cried shrilly: "Not at all&mdash;nothing is reserved,
except by order of the Yekaterinburg Soviet. Besides, how
do we know you are what you say? And who is this woman
with you?" A.J. pulled out his wallet of documents and
displayed them hopefully. They were so magnificently
sealed and stamped that most of the men, who could not
read, seemed willing enough to accept their validity. But
again the Jew was truculent. He read through everything
very carefully and critically examined the seals. Then he
stared insolently at the woman. "So you are taking her
to Moscow?" he remarked at length. "Well, I'm afraid you
can't. Khalinsk has no authority over Yekaterinburg and we
refuse you permission to pass. I must see Patroslav about
this. Meanwhile, you fellows, stand here on guard till I
come back."</p>

<p>He jumped down to the platform and disappeared amidst
the throng. The soldiers remained in the compartment,
talking among themselves and getting into conversation
with the two Khalinsk guards. One of the latter talked
rather indiscreetly but A.J. did not think it wise to
interfere.</p>

<p>After a few moments the little Jew returned, accompanied
by another obvious Jew, taller and rather fine-looking.
Without preamble he addressed himself to A.J.</p>

<p>"You are the Assistant-Commissar at Khalinsk?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And this woman was formerly the Countess Marie
Alexandra Adraxine?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then we cannot permit you to pass&mdash;either of you.
In fact, you are both arrested."</p>

<p>A.J. argued with sudden and rather startling vehemence:
the central government wanted this woman; she was to
supply evidence which would be wanted at a full-dress
trial of all the counter-revolutionary ringleaders; there
would be a tremendous row if some local Soviet were to
interfere with such intentions. A.J. ended by an astute
appeal to the men personally&mdash;"You two are doubtless
ambitious&mdash;you would perhaps like to see yourselves
in higher positions than a local Soviet? Do you think it
will help you to countermand the orders of the central
government? Whereas if, on the other hand&mdash;" It was
pretty bluff, but he played it well, and the two Jews were
reluctantly impressed. At last the man called Patroslav
said something to his colleague in a language A.J. did not
understand, and a lively and evidently acrimonious argument
developed between them. Then Patroslav swung round on his
heel and went off. The other Jew turned to A.J. "You are to
be allowed to proceed with your prisoner," he announced,
with sullen insolence. "But your guards must return to
Khalinsk&mdash;we will replace them by two others. And your
prisoner will travel in a third-class compartment with the
guards&mdash;we do not allow privileges of any kind to
enemies of the Revolution. You yourself, being a government
official, may remain here."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I shall go wherever the prisoner goes,
since I am still in charge and responsible."</p>

<p>"As you prefer."</p>

<p>It was all, A.J. perceived, a scheme of petty annoyance,
and on the whole he was glad to be escaping from
Yekaterinburg with nothing worse. During the whole of the
delay the woman had not spoken a word, but as they walked
down the platform to change their compartment she said: "I
am sorry, Commissar, to be inconveniencing you so much. If
I give my parole not to escape, would you not prefer to
stay in comfort where you were?"</p>

<p>"There is little difference in comfort between one place
and another," he answered.</p>

<p>But there was, for the third-class coaches were filthy
and verminous, and there was neither time nor opportunity
to make even the most perfunctory turnout.</p>

<p>The night had a brilliant moon, and the hills, seen
through the windows of the train, upreared like heaving
seas of silver. There was no light in the compartment save
that of a candle-stump fixed in the neck of a bottle.
The heavy bearded faces of the guards shone fiercely in
the flickering light. They were Ukrainians and sometimes
exchanged a few husky words in their local dialect. A.J.
had a slight understanding of this, but the men talked so
quietly that he could not catch more than a few words here
and there.</p>

<p>Suddenly the train came to a jangling standstill, and
after some delay a train official walked along the track
with the information that a bridge had been blown up just
ahead and that all passengers must walk on several miles
to the next station, where another train would be waiting.
A.J., his prisoner, and the two guards, climbed down to the
track, which ran in a wide curve through densely wooded
country. One of the guards declared that he knew the spot
quite well, and that there was an easy short-cut to the
station across country. A.J. doubtfully agreed and they set
off along a wide pathway that met the railway at a tangent.
They all walked in silence for a few minutes, with the
voices of the other passengers still within hearing; but
soon they were amongst tall pine-trees, and A.J. imagined,
though he could not be certain, that the path was veering
too far to the north. He said to the guards: "Are you quite
sure that this is the way?"&mdash;and one of them answered:
"Oh yes&mdash;you can hear the engine-whistle in the
distance." A.J. listened and could certainly hear it, but
it sounded very remote.</p>

<p>They all walked on a little further, with the two guards
chattering softly together in Ukrainian. A.J.'s acute sense
of direction again warned him, and a somewhat similar
feeling of apprehension must have seized on his prisoner,
for she said "Don't you think we should have done better to
keep to the railway line?"</p>

<p>At last even the guards seemed to be undecided; they
had been walking a little ahead and now stopped and began
arguing together in excited undertones.</p>

<p>"<i>Don't</i> you think it would have been better?" she
repeated.</p>

<p>"Possibly," he answered, in a whisper. "It was certainly
foolish to let them lead us into this forest."</p>

<p>"You think they have lost the way?"</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;or maybe not."</p>

<p>"Ah," she answered. "So you too are wondering?"</p>

<p>"Wondering what?"</p>

<p>"What they are chatting about so quietly."</p>

<p>He said quickly: "I have a revolver. I am keeping a
look-out."</p>

<p>He was, in fact, beginning not to like the appearance
of things at all. Had the two guards led them deliberately
astray, and if so, with what intention? In the train he
had heard them chattering together, but they could hardly
have been plotting this particular piece of strategy since
the blown-up railway bridge could not have been foreseen.
Perhaps, however, the idea had come to one of them as a
quick impromptu, a variant upon some less immediate scheme
that they had had in mind.</p>

<p>One of the guards approached him with a measured
deliberation which, in the moonlight, seemed peculiarly
sinister. "If you will both wait here with me," he began,
"my friend says he will find out where we are and will come
back to tell us."</p>

<p>At first it seemed an innocent and reasonable
suggestion, involving the somewhat lessened danger of
being left alone with one possible enemy instead of two.
But then A.J. recollected an ancient ruse that bandits
sometimes played on their victims in Siberian forests; they
said they were going away, but they did not really do so;
they crept back and sprang on their enemies from behind.
"No," he answered, with sudden decision. "It doesn't
matter&mdash;we'll go back to where we began and then walk
along the track. I think I can remember the way."</p>

<p>He began to walk in the reverse direction with the woman
at his side and the two guards following him at a little
distance. They seemed rather disconcerted by his decision,
and continued to exchange remarks in whispers.</p>

<p>After a few moments A.J. said quietly to his companion:
"I want you to be on your guard. I don't trust those
fellows."</p>

<p>"Neither do I. What do you think their game is?"</p>

<p>"Robbery. Perhaps murder. This going back to the railway
has upset their plans&mdash;I can gather that from the way
they're talking."</p>

<p>"What can we do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;except keep our heads. Have you good
nerve?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so."</p>

<p>"Then take this revolver and use it if necessary, but
not otherwise." He handed it to her quickly as they passed
into the shadow of dark trees.</p>

<p>For the next few moments there came no sound except
the crunch of four pairs of footsteps over the fir-cones.
Neither A.J. nor the woman spoke, and the two guards also
had ceased their whispered conversation.</p>

<p>A.J.'s eyes were searching ahead for any sign of the
railway as well as preparing for any lightning emergency in
the rear. The silence and darkness of the forest were both
uncanny, and though he listened acutely for any repetition
of that distant engine-whistle, he heard nothing. After
walking for some ten minutes, by which time he estimated
that the railway ought to have come into view, the track
narrowed and began to twist uphill. He whispered suddenly:
"I've lost my way."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"It means we may have to spend the rest of the night in
the forest with these ruffians." A moment later he added:
"They're talking again&mdash;they're guessing we're lost,
and I'm afraid it suits them only too well. I think I'd
rather have it out with them than go on like this."</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, facing the guards so quickly that
they had not time to conceal the revolvers in their hands.
"Gentlemen," he said calmly, "I think you must find it
a burden to carry those weapons as well as our luggage.
Suppose you hand them over to me&mdash;I can guard the
party if we are attacked."</p>

<p>The very unexpectedness of the request might have
succeeded with one of the men, had not the other, with a
snarl of rage, flung himself all at once upon A.J. The
other then went to his companion's assistance, and the
three men were soon engaged in a desperate struggle in
which darkness seemed an extra enemy of them all. One
powerful pair of arms gripped A.J. round the neck, while
another seized his right arm and sought to wrest away the
revolver. Both assailants were exceedingly strong, and
though A.J. was strong also, he could not have held out for
long against such odds. Suddenly one of the guards managed
to wrench his own revolver free and aimed it full in A.J.'s
face; and simultaneously a second revolver swung on to
the scene and glinted in a shaft of moonlight. The two
triggers were pressed almost together, but there was only
one report. The guard's weapon misfired, and a second later
its owner collapsed to the ground. A.J. turned to deal with
the second guard, but with a sharp movement the latter drew
back and plunged wildly into the undergrowth and away.</p>

<p>A.J. was left, revolver in hand, peering down at a
huddled body. The woman stood close to him, also holding a
weapon, but hers was smoking.</p>

<p>He stooped and said, after a pause: "He's dead."</p>

<p>"Is he? I did it."</p>

<p>"Probably saving your own life as well as mine."</p>

<p>"Yes, I daresay. But what has to be done now?"</p>

<p>"This&mdash;before anything else."</p>

<p>He dragged the body to one side of the path and pushed
it into the midst of thick undergrowth.</p>

<p>"Was the other fellow hurt?" she then asked.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;only terrified. He'll soon find his way to the
nearest village and tell everybody. There'll be a pretty
big fuss."</p>

<p>"But we were being attacked&mdash;it was self-defence,
surely?"</p>

<p>"In a way, yes, but he's hardly likely to say so, and
nobody's likely to take our word for it against his.
Probably he'll say we're counter-revolutionary spies and
that we seized the chance of a train hold-up to lure our
two guards into the forest and attack them."</p>

<p>"But you have your papers to prove who you are?"</p>

<p>"You saw for yourself how doubtfully they were accepted
in Yekaterinburg. After the stories that fellow will spread
about us, they'll count even less."</p>

<p>"Then it looks as if we'd better move on."</p>

<p>"Yes. Instantly."</p>

<p>"Do you know which way to go?"</p>

<p>"Away from the nearest village. That means, almost
certainly, uphill."</p>

<p>Then they discovered that they were both quite
breathless. All about them were the dark pillars of
tree-trunks, with here and there a delicate pattern on
the undergrowth where moonlight spilled through. He began
to gather up the various bundles that the two guards had
thrown down. Then they hurried away. They climbed in
silence for some time, till at last she asked, in a very
ordinary casual voice, what he was thinking about. He
answered: "To be exact, about a packet of chocolate I left
on the seat in the train."</p>

<p>She laughed softly. "Never mind. I have some. Shall we
share it?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. Better get on further."</p>

<p>They went on climbing amongst the trees, stopping only
now and then to listen for any distant sound. But none
could be heard distinctly, though once, from the very edge
of the world, it seemed, there came what might have been
the wail of a train-whistle. As they climbed higher, the
trees thinned out into the open, and suddenly they reached
a high curving summit outlined against the moonlight like
a knife-edge. The air, after the cool forest depths, was
warm, and they themselves were again breathless. "Keep in
shadow," he ordered, and they took a few backward steps
into a little hollow full of dead leaves. A squirrel
scampered past them as they halted. "Now for your
chocolate," he said.</p>

<p>They sat down on a leafy slope and shared the chocolate
and also a hunk of black bread that he had brought from
Tarkarovsk. There was nothing to drink, but he had a
water-bottle and they could find a stream as soon as it
grew daylight. They ate ravenously and were still hungry
when they had finished. Then it was necessary to make
plans, tentatively, at any rate, for the future.</p>

<p>A.J. was not disposed to minimise the seriousness of the
situation. The story that the runaway guard would doubtless
tell was just as credible as theirs&mdash;perhaps more so
to those he would be addressing. A man supposed to be a
Siberian assistant-commissar, supposed also to be escorting
to Moscow a dangerous female counter-revolutionary
and member of the aristocracy; the doubts that the
Yekaterinburg officials had had, and their precautionary
escort of two Red guards; the shooting of one of these
guards in the middle of a forest&mdash;such a story would
not seem difficult either to believe or to interpret in
a district notorious for its 'redness.' And as for the
wallet-full of assorted stamps and seals, A.J. began to
feel that their presence might be a danger quite as much as
a safeguard.</p>

<p>If they could only make their way to another district,
across country, say, to the northern railway at Perm, they
could there continue their journey to Moscow incognito,
as it were. A.J. was fairly sure that his story would
be credited at headquarters, especially as the Moscow
authorities had had so much trouble themselves with the
turbulent Uralian provinces. Anyhow, all that remained in
the less immediate future; the more pressing problem was
to avoid detection by search-parties who might soon be
scouring the forests.</p>

<p>Fortunately for their chances of escape, the surrounding
country was full of wanderers, refugees driven from their
homes by the press of war or famine, seeking friends or
relatives in distant parts of the country, or else tramping
vaguely from village to village in default of anything
more definite to do. Even in the forest country there
were folk of this kind to be met with, and A.J. could not
think of any better disguise than for the two of them to
appear to be such wanderers. His own attire was reasonably
suitable as it stood, but he realised that it would take a
certain amount of adjustment to make his prisoner look like
anything but a former aristocrat. Her clothes, though old
and shabby, were hardly such as a peasant would ever have
possessed, and her shoes, even after repeated patchings,
were still recognisably foreign. He dared not allow her
to be seen until these incongruities were removed, and he
explained the matter to her briefly. "We shall have to be
particularly careful during the next twenty-four hours," he
insisted. "As soon as it is daylight I will leave you in
some arranged spot and try to get clothes for you. If there
is a village anywhere within a few miles I ought to be able
to manage it."</p>

<p>After their short rest he climbed the hill while she
remained more prudently below. The moon was now fast
sinking over a distant ridge, and while he crouched in the
long grass trying to get his bearings he saw the first
whiff of dawn creeping over the eastern horizon. Soon he
could see the forests turning from black to green and the
sky from grey to palest blue; then, very slowly, the mist
unrolled along the floor of the valley. But there was no
sign of any village. It was, he knew, a sparsely populated
district, and quite possibly the nearest settlement might
be a score or more miles away. If that were so, he and his
prisoner must hide in the forest during the day and push on
as fast as they could when night fell.</p>

<p>By the time he rejoined her it was quite light, and
the clear cloudless sky showed promise of a hot day. He
took off his coat and then looked around for a stream from
which to fill his water-bottle. Cautiously he descended the
slope, skirting the hill in a wide curve, with the first
rays of sunlight splitting joyously through the foliage.
How lovely the world seemed, but for human beastliness,
and how disgusting to wish that the birds were not singing
so loudly, because they made it difficult to listen for
anyone approaching in the distance. Yet behind a certain
quiet rage and perturbation, excitement was on him, and
when at last he found a stream, bubbling crystal-clear
over pearl-grey rocks, he knelt to it and, dashing the icy
water over his face and head, felt what was almost a new
sensation&mdash;happiness.</p>

<p>After filling his water-bottle he looked up and saw
something that gave him a sudden shock. It was a timbered
roof half-hidden among the trees no more than a hundred
yards away, yet even so close it would have been easy to
miss it. Probably a woodman's cottage, he thought, and
with still cautious steps approached a little nearer to
find out. Then he saw a thin wisp of smoke curling up
amidst the treetops that screened the tiny habitation.
The loneliness of the place as well as its look of cosy
comfortableness lured him to an even closer examination;
he worked his way through the trees towards a side which
no window overlooked. In another moment he was standing
against the outside wall and listening carefully&mdash;but
there were no sounds of voices or of movement from within.
Then he turned the corner and, crouching near the window,
slowly lifted his head and peered over the sill. It was
the usual one-roomed habitation of the peasant, very dirty
and untidy; two persons, man and woman, were sleeping on a
heap of straw and rags in a corner, and from their attitude
and state of attire, A.J. guessed it to be a sleep of
drunkenness. With greater interest, however, he saw the
heap of clothes on the floor which the couple had thrown
off. That settled it; it seemed that fortune had given
him a chance which it would be far bigger folly to miss
than to take. With his revolver in one hand he lifted the
door-latch with the other; as he had hoped and expected,
the door was not locked. He simply walked in, picked up the
litter of clothes, walked out, closed the door carefully
behind him, and climbed the hill through the trees. Nothing
could have been easier, and he was glad that, from their
appearance, the couple would still have many hours to
sleep.</p>

<p>His prisoner laughed when he threw down the heap of
clothes in front of her. Then she took grateful gulps of
water from the bottle he offered. "You are very kind,
Commissar," she said. "But you had better not make a habit
of leaving me alone as you did just then. I warn you that I
shall escape at any suitable opportunity."</p>

<p>"Naturally," he answered, with a shade of irony. "But
for the present remember that we are both escaping."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's queer, isn't it? You are taking me to
Moscow, where I shall probably be put on trial and
shot; but for the time being I haven't to think about
that&mdash;I must only bother about preserving my life
during the next twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it all strikes me as rather illogical. If I
am to be killed anyhow, does it matter very much who does
the job?"</p>

<p>"That, of course, is for you to decide. Personally,
if I were in your place, I should rather think it <i>did</i>
matter."</p>

<p>She suddenly put a hand on his sleeve. "Commissar,
I can lose nothing, can I, by asking a question? Just
this&mdash;must you really take me to Moscow and hand
me over? Hasn't my own&mdash;our own&mdash;our rather
unusual fate so far&mdash;given you a hint of anything
else? To me it almost seems as if fate were asking you
to give me a chance. Briefly, Commissar, I have friends
abroad&mdash;influential friends&mdash;who would make
it considerably worth your while if you would take me
somewhere else instead of Moscow. Odessa, shall we
say&mdash;or Rostov? You would have earned the reward by
your courtesy alone, and as for me, how can the Revolution
suffer because one poor woman takes ship for a foreign
country?"</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment in absolute silence. Then
he merely replied: "You are mistaken in me&mdash;I am not
bribable. And also, by the way, you must remember in future
not to call me 'Commissar.'"</p>

<p>"I see." And after a pause she added: "You are quite
incorruptible, then?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>She smiled and shrugged her shoulders. "Well, anyhow,
let's not quarrel about it. Perhaps, after all, you think I
deserve to be shot?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't say that. I don't think anything at all
about it. You are my prisoner and I am taking you to
Moscow. That is all." He went on, more quickly: "Will you
please put on these clothes without delay? We <i>must</i> get
on&mdash;every minute increases the danger."</p>

<p>"Are they clean?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I hadn't time to look. Probably not,
but you must wear them, anyhow."</p>

<p>She laughed and their serious conversation ended by
tacit agreement. She was amused at having to dress herself
in a peasant's long skirt and coarse coloured blouse,
and she was still further amused when he told her how
he had obtained them. Her own clothes they buried in a
hiding-place under a heap of dead leaves; it was safer, he
decided, than trying to burn them. Then he cut his beard
and moustache, transforming his appearance to an extent
that caused her a good deal of additional amusement. Next
their joint luggage was carefully sorted out and all
articles that might seem suspicious were also hidden away
under the leaves. Finally he slit open the lining of his
coat and carefully concealed all his commissary papers and
a few government banknotes of large denomination.</p>

<p>These preparations took some time, and it was after
eight o'clock when a fairly typical pair of peasant
wanderers made their way down the hill to the valley on
the far side of it. The man was tall and well-built, with
a thin stubble of beard round his chin (he had not dared
to give himself a close shave because of the deep tan that
covered the rest of his face). The woman, slighter in build
and pale even in the sunlight, trudged along beside him.
They did not converse a great deal, but the man exchanged
cheerful greetings with fellow-peasants passing in the
opposite direction.</p>

<p>Arrangements had been reached about other matters. They
had given each other names that were common enough, yet
not suspiciously so; he was Pyotr Petrovich Barenin, of
the imaginary village of Nikolovsk, in the province of
Orenburg; she was his daughter Natasha (called 'Daly').
They were trying to reach Petrograd, where he had a brother
who had formerly been a workman in the Putilov factory.
They were both poor people, he a simple-minded peasant
who could neither read nor write, but his daughter, thank
God, had had an education and had spent some years as
lady's maid in an aristocratic family. (Hence her accent
and soft hands.) But they had both fallen lately on evil
times&mdash;she, of course, had lost her job, and he had
had his cottage burned down by White brigands. It was
all just the sort of ordinary and quite unexceptionally
pathetic case of which there were probably some millions of
examples at that time throughout the country.</p>

<p>The morning warmed and freshened as the couple wound
their way along the valley road. They met few people, and
none save humble travellers like themselves; from one of
these peasant wayfarers A.J. bargained a loaf of bread.
With this and a few wild strawberries gathered by the
roadside they made a simple but satisfactory meal, washed
down with icy mountain-water from a stream.</p>

<p>Throughout the day they did not see a solitary
habitation or come within rumour of a village. All about
them stretched the lonely forest-covered foothills of the
Urals, dark with pine-trees and soaring into the hazy
distance where a few of the peaks still kept their outlines
hidden in mist. The air was full of aromatic scents, and by
the wayside, as they trudged, high banks of wild flowers
waved their softer perfumes.</p>

<p>Towards evening they met an old bearded peasant of whom
A.J. asked the distance to the nearest village. "Three
versts," he answered. "But if you are travellers seeking a
night's shelter, you had better not go there." A.J. asked
why, and the man answered: "A band of soldiers have been
raiding the place in search of someone supposed to have
murdered a Red guard in the forests. The soldiers are still
there, and if you were to arrive as a stranger they might
arrest you on suspicion. You know what ruffians those
fellows are when they are dealing with us simple folk."
A.J. agreed and thanked the man; it was a fine night, he
added, and it would do himself and his daughter no harm to
rest in the forest. "Oh, but there is no need to do that,"
urged the other.</p>

<p>"You can have shelter at my cottage just away up yonder
hill. I am a woodcutter&mdash;Dorenko by name&mdash;but I
am not a ruffian like most woodcutters. As soon as I saw
you and your daughter coming along the road I thought how
tired she looked and I felt sorry for her. Yes, indeed,
brother, you are fortunate&mdash;not many woodcutters are
like me. I have a kind heart, having lost my wife last
year. Perhaps I may marry again some day. I have a nice
little cottage and it is clean and very comfortable, though
the cockroaches are a nuisance. Come, brother, you and your
girl will enjoy a good meal and a night's rest under a
roof."</p>

<p>A.J., thinking chiefly of the soldiers in the
neighbouring village, accepted the invitation, and the
three began to walk uphill, turning off the road after a
short distance and entering again the steep and already
darkening forest. A.J. told the old man the barest facts
about himself; and was glad to note that they were accepted
quite naturally and without the least curiosity. "I, too,
had a daughter once," said Dorenko, "but she ran away and I
never heard of her afterwards. She was not so good-looking
as yours."</p>

<p>After a quarter of an hour's hard climb they came
to another of those forest cottages, timber-built, and
completely hidden from any distant view. The interior was
not particularly clean and comfortable, despite Dorenko's
contrary opinion, and though also, after his warning, they
were prepared for cockroaches, they had hardly imagined
such a plague of them as existed. They swarmed over
everything; they were on walls and roof, and in every crack
and corner; they had to be shaken off the bread and skimmed
out of liquids; they crackled underfoot and fell in soft
sizzling pats on to the smouldering hearth. "Yes," admitted
Dorenko, tranquilly, "they are a nuisance, but I will say
this for them&mdash;they never bite."</p>

<p>Dorenko was certainly hospitable. He made his guests an
appetising meal of soup and eggs; barring the cockroaches,
there would have been much to enjoy. He talked a good deal,
especially about his late wife and his loneliness since
she had died. "Yes, indeed, I may marry again some day.
I am on the lookout for the right sort of person, as you
may guess. And, of course, it would not be a bad match
in these days for a girl to marry an honest woodcutter
who has his own cottage and perhaps a little money hidden
away, too." He leered cunningly. "You see I am trusting
you, Pyotr Petrovich. I know you are not the kind that
would rob an honest woodcutter. But it is a fact, I assure
you&mdash;I have hundreds of silver roubles buried in the
ground beneath this cottage. Think of it&mdash;and you are,
without doubt, a poor man!"</p>

<p>"I am a poor man, it is true, but I certainly would not
rob you."</p>

<p>"I know that, brother. As soon as I saw you coming
along the road I thought&mdash;Here comes an honest man.
And honest men are rare in these days&mdash;nearly as rare
as gold roubles, eh? Or shall we say nearly as rare as a
good-looking woman?"</p>

<p>A.J. conversed with him amiably for a time and then, as
it was quite dark and Dorenko possessed no lamp, suggested
settling down for the night. He was, in fact, dead tired,
and he knew that Daly (as he had already begun to think
of her) must be the same. He arranged for her to have the
best place&mdash;near the fire and for that reason not
so popular with the cockroaches; he and Dorenko shared
the ground nearer the door. He was so sleepy that he felt
almost afraid of going to sleep; he guessed that in any
emergency he would be hard to awaken. However, Dorenko
seemed trustworthy and there was always the revolver at
hand. He lay down with it carefully concealed beneath the
bundle of clothes that formed his pillow. Neither he nor
Daly undressed at all, but Dorenko took off his outer
clothes and performed the most intimate ritual of toilet
quite frankly and shamelessly in the darkness. A decent,
honest fellow, no doubt.</p>

<p>A.J. went to sleep almost instantly and knew nothing
thenceforward till he felt himself being energetically
shaken. "What's the matter?" he cried, rubbing his
eyes and groping for his revolver. It was still dark
and all was perfectly silent except for the scurry of
cockroaches disturbed by his sudden movement. "It's only
me, brother&mdash;Dorenko the woodcutter," came a hoarse
whisper a few inches from his right ear. "I waited till
your daughter was asleep so that we could have a little
talk together in private."</p>

<p>"But I'm really far too sleepy to talk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, but listen, brother. You are a poor man, are you
not?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, but does it matter at this time of
night?"</p>

<p>"It matters a great deal when you have to tramp the
roads with a poor sick daughter. She looked so very tired
and ill to-night, brother&mdash;it's plain she isn't used
to walking the roads."</p>

<p>"Of course she isn't&mdash;as I told you, she's been
used to a much more delicate life."</p>

<p>"In a fine house no doubt, eh, brother? Ah, that's
it&mdash;it's a home she wants&mdash;a roof over her
head&mdash;not to be tramping the roads all day long. And
you&mdash;wouldn't you be able to get to Petrograd quicker
without her? After all, a man can rough things, but it's
different when he has a girl dragging along with him."
He added in a fierce whisper: "Brother, haven't you ever
thought of her getting married to some decent hardworking
fellow who, maybe, has a comfortable house and a bit of
money put away? I'm a good fellow, I assure you, though
I am only a woodcutter, and to tell the truth, your
daughter's just the kind of woman I've been looking out for
ever since my poor wife died. And you shall have a hundred
silver roubles for yourself, brother, if you give her to
me."</p>

<p>A.J. was still too sleepy to be either amused or
annoyed. He said merely: "Dorenko, it's quite out of the
question. My daughter, I know, wouldn't consider it."</p>

<p>"But if, as her father, you ordered her to?"</p>

<p>"She wouldn't, even then."</p>

<p>"She would disobey you?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly."</p>

<p>"Ah, I sympathise. My own daughter was like
that&mdash;disobedient to her own father. It is a dreadful
thing to have children like that. All the same, brother,
I will make it a hundred and fifty roubles for you if you
could manage to persuade her."</p>

<p>"No, Dorenko, it's no use&mdash;it's impossible."</p>

<p>"Not because I am only a woodcutter?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, by no means. Not in the least for that
reason."</p>

<p>"Ah, Pyotr Petrovich, you are a good fellow like myself,
I can see. It is a pity we could not have come to some
arrangement. However, perhaps it is God's will that I
should look elsewhere. Good-night&mdash;Good-night."</p>

<p>A.J. was soon asleep again and did not wake till the
sunlight was pouring through the narrow window. Dorenko was
already up and preparing a breakfast meal. He did not refer
to the matter he had broached during the night, and after a
homely meal the two travellers thanked him and set out to
continue their journey. A.J. would have liked to offer him
money, but that such generosity would not have suited the
story of being poor.</p>

<p>Dorenko had given them directions before starting,
telling them how they might travel so as to avoid the
village which the soldiers had raided, and reach another
less dangerous one by the end of the day. The route led
them through the forest for several miles and then along a
narrow winding track amidst the hills. It was again very
hot in the middle of the day. They slept for a time in
the shade of the pines, and then, towards evening, walked
into a small town named Saratursk, whose market-place was
full of Red soldiers, bedraggled and badly disciplined
after long marches. It was hardly likely that they could
be bothering about a casual forest murder, for much more
serious events had happened during the past twenty-four
hours. The Whites and the Czecho-Slovaks, acting together,
had crossed the Urals and were reported in rapid invasion;
the entire Revolution seemed in danger. All day long a
steadily increasing stream of refugees had been entering
Saratursk from the east; A.J. and Daly were but two out
of thousands, and quite inconspicuous. They found it
impossible to obtain any food except black bread at an
extortionate price, and every room in the town was full
of sleepers. Fortunately the night was warm, and it was
not unpleasant to spread out one's bundle on the cobbled
stones and breathe the mountainy air. Sleep, however, was
interrupted by the constant noise and shouting; fresh
detachments of soldiers were entering the town from the
west and south and reuniting with their comrades already
in possession. They were a fierce-looking crowd, all
of them, dressed in shabby, tattered, and nondescript
uniforms&mdash;dirty, unkempt, heavy with fatigue. They
had no obvious leaders, but throughout the night they held
meetings in the market-square to elect new officers. There
was much fervid oratory and cheering. The news of the
White advance had put them in considerable consternation,
for they themselves were badly armed&mdash;only one man
in five or six possessing a rifle. The rest carried
swords, knives, and even sticks. Some of them had been
dragged out of hospitals too soon, and still wore dirty
red-stained bandages. This curious, slatternly throng
was, for the moment, all that stood between Moscow and
counter-revolution.</p>

<p>All night long the hubbub proceeded, and soon after dawn
something&mdash;but it was not clear exactly what&mdash;was
decided upon. A few squads of men marched out of the town
to the east; the rest, apparently, were to follow later.
But shortly afterwards came a sharp outbreak of rifle-fire
among the hills behind the town, and in less than an hour
the original squads returned in a condition bordering on
panic. The hills, they reported, were already in the hands
of White outposts; Saratursk must be abandoned instantly.
Whereupon soldiers, civilians, and refugees immediately
gathered up as many of their personal possessions as they
could and took part in a furious stampede to the west. The
road was narrow&mdash;no more than a mere track&mdash;and
military wagons jammed and collided into an immovable
obstruction during the first quarter-mile. The wagons
were full of ammunition and other military equipment, and
after a vain attempt to disentangle the chaos the soldiers
unloaded the stores and carried them forward on their
backs. The sun rose blindingly on weary men staggering
ahead with glazed and desperate eyes, straining the utmost
nerve to put distance between themselves and a relentless
enemy. Some of them, tired of scuffles in the roadway,
took to the open fields and blundered on, with no guide to
direction save the blaze of the sun on their backs. All
through the morning came intermittent bursts of rifle-fire,
each one rather nearer, it seemed; and there was a fresh
outbreak of panic when a small child, fleeing with her
parents, was struck and slightly injured by a spent bullet.
Towards noon the rout was already becoming more than many
could endure; refugees and even soldiers were collapsing
by dozens along the roadside, throwing themselves face
downwards in the dust and writhing convulsively. Some of
them seemed to be dying, and there were rumours that White
spies in Saratursk had put poison in the drinking-water
from which many of the fugitives had filled their
bottles.</p>

<p>A.J., hastening onwards, felt suddenly very ill himself.
Severe internal pains gripped him, and at last he guessed
that he was on the verge of collapse. He staggered and
fell, tried to rise again, but could not; all the earth and
the wide sky swam in circles before his eyes. He had to
say: "I can't go on any further. I'm ill." And to himself
he added that Fate, after all, was giving her the chance
she had been wishing for; she could escape now, quite
easily, and he had no power to stop her.</p>

<p>He knew that she was raising his head and staring into
his eyes. "Is there anything I can do?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all for me. But for yourself&mdash;well,
you have only to go back into Saratursk and meet your
friends."</p>

<p>"They'll find me here if I stay."</p>

<p>"Yes, but in that case they'd find me, too, and I
don't fancy being taken prisoner. Besides, there's bound
to be firing along this road. Take the papers out of my
coat&mdash;they'll prove who you are."</p>

<p>"And yourself?"</p>

<p>"I shall manage, I daresay, with luck."</p>

<p>"You want me to leave you here?"</p>

<p>"I think you ought to take the chance that offers
itself. If you stay, there'll only be greater danger to
both of us. So go now&mdash;and hurry. Don't forget the
papers."</p>

<p>"You are letting me go, then?"</p>

<p>"Circumstances compel me, that's all."</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it is&mdash;good of you. I hope you manage
yourself all right."</p>

<p>"Most probably I shall if I'm not found with you. Take
the papers."</p>

<p>"Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the papers&mdash;the papers&mdash;in the
lining of my coat."</p>

<p>He felt her hands searching him; he heard her say
something, but he could not gather what&mdash;he was fast
sinking into unconsciousness. Ages seemed to pass; at
intervals he opened his eyes and heard great commotion
proceeding all around and over him. Successive waves of
pain assaulted and left him gasping with weakness. It
was dark when he finally awoke. Pain was ebbing by then,
and his strength with it. Queer sounds still echoed in
his ears&mdash;murmurs as of distant shouting, distant
rifle-fire. The starlight shone a pale radiance over the
earth; he saw that he was lying in a sort of gully and
that, a few yards away, there was something that looked
like another man. He called 'Hello!' but there was no
answer. Perhaps the fellow was asleep. He was suddenly
anxious to meet somebody, to speak a word to somebody.
There had been a battle, he guessed, and it would be
interesting to learn whether the Whites or the Reds had
been victorious. It hardly seemed to matter very much, but,
just out of curiosity, as it were, he would like to know.
And Daly, his prisoner, had she by now been safely received
and identified by her friends?... God, how thirsty he
was&mdash;he would offer that man some money in return for
a drink of anything but poisoned water. Slowly, and with
greater difficulty than he had expected, he crawled along
the gully towards the huddled figure. Then he perceived
that the man was dead&mdash;killed by a smashing blow in
the face. That, for all that he had seen so many dead
bodies in his time, unnerved him a little; he stared round
him a little vaguely, as if uncertain how to interpret
the discovery. Then he rose unsteadily to his feet and
began to stagger about. He climbed on to the roadway and
up the sloping bank on to the pale stubble fields. He
walked a little way&mdash;a few hundred yards&mdash;and
then saw another dead man. Then another. A man with his
head nearly blown off at close range. A man huddled in the
final writhings of a bayonet-thrust through the stomach. A
man covered with blood from a drained and severed artery.
Most of the dead, from their uniforms, were Reds; a few
only could have belonged to the other side. Sickly qualms
overspread him as he wandered aimlessly among these huddled
figures. Then he suddenly heard a cry. It seemed to come
from a distance; he turned slightly and heard it again.
"Brother!" it called. He walked towards it. "What is it?"
he whispered, and the reply came: "Are you not wounded,
brother?"&mdash;"No," he answered, and the voice rejoined:
"Neither am I. Come here."</p>

<p>He approached a prostrate form that proved to be a Red
soldier whose face was ghastly with congealed blood. Only,
as the man explained with immediate cheerfulness, it was
not his own blood. "Brother," he said, "I am an old soldier
and I know from experience what war is like. It is all very
fine if you are winning easily, but it is unpleasant when
you are being attacked by a much stronger enemy. The best
thing to do at such a time, in my opinion, is to fall down
and pretend to be dead. Then, if you are lucky, the enemy
doesn't bother about you. I have saved my life three times
by this method&mdash;twice with the Germans and once again
today. I suppose you too, brother, did the same?"</p>

<p>"No," answered A.J. "I fell ill in the morning and
that's all I remember."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, it happened to so many of our poor fellows.
Some White spy poisoned the water in Saratursk&mdash;a
disgusting way of carrying on war, I call it. Not that I'm
tremendously against the Whites&mdash;I believe they give
their soldiers very good pay. For myself, I have a great
mind to go into Saratursk to-morrow and join them. Do you
feel like coming with me, brother?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks."</p>

<p>"Mind you, I wouldn't do it if the Reds were as
generous. I really <i>prefer</i> the Reds, really. But a
soldier's job, after all, is to fight, and if he gets good
food and pay, why should he bother what side he fights on?
It isn't for him to pick and choose. That's how I feel
about it. Would you like something to eat, brother?"</p>

<p>"I should indeed."</p>

<p>"Then sit here with me. I have some bread and a
sausage. I'm afraid I was rather scared at first when I
woke up and saw you walking about. I thought you were
a ghost&mdash;they say there are ghosts that haunt
battlefields, you know. Yes, it was a sharp little fight,
but our men stood no chance at all&mdash;every man on the
other side had a rifle and ammunition. It was ridiculous to
make a stand."</p>

<p>"Where are the Whites now?"</p>

<p>"Still chasing our poor fellows, I expect. Whereas you
and I, my friend, have had the sense to let them pass over
us. We are all right. Two hours' walk and we shall be in
the woods, and an army corps wouldn't find us there. Do you
know this part of the country?"</p>

<p>"Not very well."</p>

<p>"Then after our little meal I will take you along.
Perhaps, after all, I need not be in any hurry to enlist
with the Whites. A few days' rest first of all, anyhow.
We have three hours vet before dawn. If we hurry we shall
reach the woods in good time."</p>

<p>They ate quickly but with enjoyment, and then began the
walk over the stubble fields. During the first mile or so
they passed many dead bodies, but after that the signs of
battle grew less evident. They avoided the road, along
which White military wagons were still tearing westward in
the rear of the pursuing army. A.J. wondered if there were
not some danger of their being found and taken prisoner,
but his companion, whose name was Oblimov, seemed quite
confident of being able to reach the hills in safety. He
had thrown away his soldier's cap and the rest of his
clothing was certainly so nondescript that it could convey
little to any observer. "Besides," he said, "if anyone
questions us, we can say we are White refugees returning to
our homes."</p>

<p>They skirted Saratursk on the north side, working their
way through orchards and private gardens, and passing
within sight of several big houses in which lights were
visible. In one of them the blinds had not been lowered,
and they could sec that a party of some kind was in
progress. White officers were drinking and shouting, and
there carne also, tinkling over the night air, the sound of
women's laughter. A.J. wondered if his former prisoner were
there, or in some other such house, celebrating her freedom
and rescue. Oblimov said: "They will soon drink away their
victory." It certainly looked as if many of the White
officers had preferred Saratursk to the continued pursuit
of the enemy.</p>

<p>They reached the lower slopes of the hills just as the
first tint of dawn appeared, and by the time the sun rose
they were high amongst the woods. A.J. was by now beginning
to feel very comfortable amongst the pine trees; he liked
their clean, sharp tang and the rustle of fir-cones under
his feet. He was tired, however, after the climb, and
also, beyond his relief, rather depressed. The world
seemed a sadly vague and pointless kind of place, with its
continual movement of armies and refugees, and its battles
and tragedies and separations. He kept wondering how his
prisoner had fared. He did not particularly regret her
escape; he had done his best, but Fate had out-manoeuvred
him. Nine-tenths of life seemed always to consist of
letting things happen.</p>

<p>Oblimov was an excellent and resourceful companion.
He made a fire and boiled tea, and while A.J. slept in
the dappled sunshine he raided a woodman's cottage in the
valley and came back with bread and meat. He also brought
some coarse tobacco, which he smoked joyously during the
whole of the afternoon. He was a great talker and looked
on life in a mood of pleasant fatalism. Soldiering was
doubtless the worst job in the world, but what else was
there for a man of his type? He had no home; he couldn't
settle down. And soldiers did, in a sense, see the world.
They met people, too&mdash;people they would never have met
otherwise&mdash;"like yourself, brother. We came across
each other on the battlefield, surrounded by dead men, and
now we are yarning in a wood with our bellies full and the
blue sky over us. To-morrow, maybe, we shall say good-bye
and never see each other again. But is it not worth while?
And will you ever forget me, or I you?"</p>

<p>He went on to tell of his many experiences; he had been
fighting, he said, for years&mdash;ever since he had been a
young man. He had fought for the Serbs in the first Balkan
War and against the Serbs in the second Balkan War, and
in the Great War, of course, he had fought the Germans.
But that war had not pleased him at all, and after a year
of it he had allowed himself to be taken prisoner. Fie
admitted it quite frankly; his view of war was a strictly
professional and trade union one: if soldiers were not
treated properly, why should they go on performing their
job? Two years in a German prison-camp had not been
pleasant, but they had been preferable, he believed, to
what he might have had to endure otherwise. The return of
the prisoners to Russia after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk
had brought him back again to normal life&mdash;that of
ordinary, rational soldiering. "A soldier does not mind
occasionally risking his life," he explained, "nor does he
object to a battle now and again or a few tiring marches
across country. But to stand in a frozen trench for weeks
on end is another matter&mdash;it isn't fair to ask such
a thing of any man." The warfare between Reds and Whites
was much more to his taste&mdash;the localness of it, its
sudden bursts of activity, its continual changes of scene,
and its almost limitless chances of loot and personal
adventure&mdash;all agreed with him. He did not much care
on which side he fought; lie had already fought on both and
would doubtless do so again. "But personally," he added, "I
am a man of the people."</p>

<p>His completely detached attitude towards life and
affairs prompted A.J. to confide in him more than it was
his habit to confide in acquaintances. He told him briefly
about the 'daughter' with whom he had been wandering and
from whom he had become separated during the excitements
of the day before. What was really on his mind was whether
she was likely to have been decently treated by the White
soldiers before the proving of her identity. To Oblimov,
of course, he merely expressed his anxieties as a father.
Oblimov was sympathetic, but hardly reassuring. "What will
happen to her depends on what sort of a girl she is," he
declared concisely. "If she is pretty and not pure she
will have a very good time. If she is pure and not pretty
she will be left alone. But if she is pretty and wishes
to remain pure..." He left the sentence unfinished.
"Women," he added, "are really not worth worrying about,
anyway, and evidently you think so too, else you would
be searching Saratursk for your daughter at this present
moment instead of enjoying the sunshine." A.J. was a little
startled by this acuteness. Oblimov laughed and went on:
"Brother, you cannot deceive an old soldier. I believe she
is not your daughter at all, but your wife or mistress,
and you are more than half glad to be rid of her! Don't be
offended&mdash;I know you think you are very fond of her
and are worried about her safety. But I can see that deep
down in your heart you do not care."</p>

<p>He went on talking about women in general, and A.J.
went on listening until both occupations were suddenly
interrupted by a sound that came to them very clearly
across the valley. It was the sharp rattle of machine-gun
fire. Oblimov, all his professional instincts aroused,
scented the air like a startled hound. "It looks as if the
battle's moving back on the village," he said. "Let's go
down a little and see if we can judge what's happening."</p>

<p>They picked their way amongst the trees till they
reached a small clearing whence could be seen the whole of
the valley. Machine-gun and rifle-fire was by that time
intense, and a thin chain of white smoke ringed the town
on the further side. Already a few cavalry wagons were
leaving Saratursk by the mountain road. By late afternoon
the battle was over and its results were obvious; the Reds
had retaken the town and the Whites were in full retreat
to the east. "Now," advised Oblimov, "we had better move
along ourselves. If the Whites are pursued too hard, some
of them may hide in these woods, and it would be just as
well for us not to be found with them." So they descended
the hillside and walked boldly into Saratursk. There was no
danger of their being noticed or questioned; the recaptured
town was in far too much uproar and chaos. The earlier
victory of the Whites had been due largely to the poisoning
of the water that the Red soldiers had drunk; many more men
had died of that than of battle-wounds, and the survivors
were disposed to take revenge. The whole place, they said,
was White in sympathy, and it was certainly true that the
more prosperous shopkeepers and private citizens had loaded
gifts upon White officers. Now they wished they had been
more discreet. As the victorious Reds lurched into the
town, drunk with that highly dangerous mixture of triumph
and fatigue, the shopkeepers put up their shutters and made
themselves as inconspicuous as possible. All the omens were
for an exciting night.</p>

<p>Oblimov soon joined his soldier companions, but A.J.
preferred to mingle with the crowd that surged up and down
the main street. It was a hot, swaying, tempestuous, and
increasingly bad-tempered multitude. The market-place,
packed with wounded Reds for whom there was no hospital
accommodation and hardly any but the most elementary
medical treatment, acted as a perpetual incitement to
already inflamed passions. Amidst this acre of misery
the town doctor and a few helpers worked their way
tirelessly, but there was little that could be done,
since the retreating Whites had commandeered all medical
supplies&mdash;even to bandages and surgical instruments.
This was bad enough, but even worse to many was the fact
that the Whites seemed also to have drunk the whole town
dry. There was not a bottle of beer or a dram of vodka
in any of the inns, and the litter of empty bottles in
all the gutters told its own significant tale. The first
'incident' was caused by this. A few soldiers, refusing to
believe that there was absolutely no drink to be had at
all, insisted on inspecting the cellar of one of the inns.
There they found a couple of bottles of champagne. They
drank without much enthusiasm, for they preferred stronger
stuff, and then wrecked the inn-keeper's premises. The news
of the affair soon spread and led to a systematic search,
not only of inns, but of private houses. In many cases the
terrified occupants handed over any liquor they possessed;
where they did not, or had none to hand over, the soldiers
usually went about smashing pictures and furniture amidst
wild shouts and caperings. All this time the town was
becoming more crowded; soldiers were still pouring in from
the west, and these later arrivals, having endured more
prolonged hardships, were in fiercer moods. Towards eight
o'clock the rumour went round that a certain local lawyer
had been responsible for the poisoning of the water-supply
the day before. The man, who was hiding in his house, was
dragged out into the middle of the street and clubbed to
death. This only whetted appetites; between eight and
midnight, perhaps a dozen citizens, mostly shopkeepers and
professional men, were killed in various ways and places.
Then the even more exciting rumour gained currency that a
whole houseful of Whites, including high-born officers and
ladies, were in hiding about a mile out of the town, their
retreat having been cut off by the Reds' rapid advance.
The village schoolmaster saved his life by giving details
of this illustrious colony; it included, he said, no less
a personage than the Countess Marie Alexandra Adraxine,
well known in pre-Revolution Petersburg society, and
distantly connected with the family of the ex-Emperor. She
had been passing as a peasant, continued the informative
schoolmaster, and had caused a great sensation among the
White officers by declaring and establishing her true
identity. Many of them had known her in former times, and
a great party had been held both in her honour and to
celebrate the glorious White victory of Saratursk. And
it was the effects of this and similar parties that had
helped towards the equally glorious Red victory that had so
immediately followed.</p>

<p>Some of the crowd were for marching on the house and
storming it, but the Red leader, a shrewd, capable fellow,
was impressed by the political importance of the prisoners
and anxious to act with due circumspection. Let a few local
shopkeepers be butchered by all means, but countesses
and highly-placed White officers were too valuable to be
wasted on the mob. Besides, being a person of good memory
and methodical mind, he seemed to recollect that there had
already been some bother about that particular countess;
she had been captured in Siberia, hadn't she, and had been
on her way to Moscow in charge of some local commissar
when, somehow or other, the two had escaped from the train
and had not been heard of since? The beautiful countess
and the susceptible commissar&mdash;what a theme for a
comic opera! General Polakhin, whose victory over the
Whites had been due partly to military ability but chiefly
to the sudden and almost miraculous repair of a couple of
machine-guns, smiled to himself as he gave orders that the
house should be surrounded, arid that, if its occupants
gave themselves up, they should be conducted unharmed to
the town jail.</p>

<p>This operation was carried out without a hitch, and
towards three o'clock in the morning the little procession
entered the town. There were about a dozen White officers,
whose resplendent uniforms and dejected faces contrasted
piquantly with the shabby greatcoats and triumphant faces
of their guards. There were five women also&mdash;dressed
in a weird assortment of clothes, some of them walking
painfully in ballroom slippers, and all rather pale and
weary-looking. All except one gave occasional terrified
glances at the jeering crowds that lined the streets to
the prison entrance. The exception was the woman whose
name everyone now knew&mdash;the woman who (according to
a story that was being improved on, saga-Eke, with every
telling) had beguiled a commissar into escaping with her
and had then, somehow or other, escaped from him! The
crowd were not disposed to be too unfriendly towards such
a magnificent adventuress, and if she had only played the
actress well enough, they were quite drunk enough to have
cheered her. But she did not act the right part, and her
appearance, too, was disappointingly unromantic. She gazed
ahead with calm and level eyes, as if she were not caring
either for them or for anything in the world.</p>

<p>When the captives were safely locked in the prison, the
crowd, suffering a kind of reaction, began a systematic
looting of the shops. They were, in truth, disconcerted by
the tameness of what had promised to be highly exciting,
and now worked out their spleen as best they could. Po
did not object; loot was, after all, the perquisite of
the poorly-paid soldier. By dawn the town presented a
forlorn appearance; every window in the main street had
been smashed and the gutters were full of broken glass and
miscellaneous articles that had been stolen, broken, and
then thrown away. Some of the local peasants, professing
violently Red feelings, had taken part in the looting, and
they, perhaps, had made most out of it, since they had
homes in which they could store whatever they took. One
small cottage attracted attention by having the end of a
piano sticking out of the doorway; the acquirer could not
play, but banged heavily with his fists to indicate his
delight.</p>

<p>The following day was to some extent anti-climax; the
revellers were tired and spent most of the time sleeping
off the effects of the carousal. In the afternoon, however,
fresh Red reinforcements arrived from the west&mdash;men
of even more violent temperament than those already in
possession, and accompanied, moreover, by several fluent
and apparently professional orators who harangued the crowd
in the market-place with unceasing eloquence. Polakhin,
it soon appeared, was unpopular with these new arrivals;
they doubted his 'redness,' and were particularly incensed
because he had permitted the White captives to retain their
lives.</p>

<p>A.J., mingling during the day with the crowds in the
town and sleeping at nights on the bare boards of an
inn-floor, could sense the keying of the atmosphere to
higher and more dangerous levels. He did not feel any
particular apprehension, still less any indignation; he
had seen too many horrors for either. Every barbarism
perpetrated by the Reds could be balanced by some other
perpetrated by the Whites; the scales of bloodshed and
cruelty balanced with almost exquisite exactness. There
was also a point of experience beyond which even the
imagination had no power to terrify, and A.J. had reached
such a point. What he felt was rather, in its way, a sort
of selfishness; out of all the chaos and wretchedness that
surrounded him he felt inclined to seize hold of anything
that mattered to him locally and personally in any way.
And so little, when he came to think of it, <i>did</i> matter
to him. Up to now he had been a blind automaton, letting
Fate push him whither it chose and calmly accepting any
task that was nearest. He had not cared; at Khalinsk he had
been kind and wise and hard-working, but he had not cared.
Yet now, for the first time, he felt a curious uprise of
personality, a sort of you-be-damnedness entering his soul
as he paced the streets and observed, still quite coldly,
the wreckage of a world that cared as little for him as he
for it.</p>

<p>Only very gradually did he perceive that he wanted the
woman to escape. To any normally-minded person it would
have seemed an absurd enough want, for the prison was
strongly and carefully guarded. But A.J., just then, was
not normally-minded. The more he tried to reconcile himself
to the fact that his former prisoner would eventually he
shot, like hundreds of other pleasant and possibly innocent
persons, the more he felt committed to some kind of
personal and intrepid intervention. But how, and when? He
guessed that the revolutionary ardour of the soldiers would
soon boil over and lead to the overthrow of Polakhin and
the massacre of the White prisoners; he had seen that sort
of thing happen too often not to recognise the familiar
preliminary portents. Whatever was to be done must be done
quickly&mdash;yet what could be done? He did not know in
which part of the prison she was kept, nor even whether she
were alone or with others. No doubt, wherever she was, she
was being well guarded as one of the star-turns of some
future entertainment.</p>

<p>At the prison entrance there was always a Red soldier
on guard, and it was through these men alone that A.J.
fancied he could accomplish anything. He silent many an
hour furtively watching them and speculating which of them
might be most likely to be useful for his purpose. At last
he singled out a rough, fierce-looking fellow whom, about
midnight, when the street was fairly quiet, he saw accept
a small package from a passing stranger and transfer it
guiltily to his own pocket. A.J. took the chance that thus
offered itself.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, comrade," he began, walking up to the man
a moment later and looking him sternly between the eyes.
"Do you usually do that sort of thing?"</p>

<p>It was a blind shot, but a lucky one. The guard, for
all his fierce appearance, was a coward as soon as he
thought himself discovered. He obviously took A.J. for
an official spy who had been set deliberately to watch
him, and A.J. did not disabuse him of the notion. He soon
drove the fellow to an abject confession that he had been
systematically smuggling tobacco into the prison for the
benefit of the White officers. "Only tobacco, your honour,"
he insisted, and produced from his pocket the little packet
he had just received. "You know, your honour, how hard it
is for a poor soldier to make a living in these days, and
the White officers who are going to be shot very soon,
promised me twenty roubles for this little packet. After
all, your honour, I don't have the chances that some of our
men get&mdash;I had to be here on duty all that night when
they were looting the shops."</p>

<p>"That was unfortunate," said A.J. dryly. "All the same,
you must be aware of the penalties for smuggling things
into the prison?"</p>

<p>"Yes, your honour, but surely you wouldn't wish to get a
poor man into serious trouble&mdash;"</p>

<p>And so on. After a quarter of an hour or so A.J. felt
he had succeeded pretty well. He had learned all about the
positions and arrangements of the prisoners, their daily
habits, and the way in which they were guarded; and, most
important of all, he had given the guard a note to be
delivered secretly to the Countess. He wrote it in French;
it merely said that he was on the spot and ready to help
her to escape, and that she must be prepared to do her
share in any way and at any time he should command. He told
the guard it was merely a family message. "I am a Red," he
added, "but I do not see what harm there can be in treating
a woman prisoner with ordinary courtesy. No more harm,
anyway, than in smuggling tobacco for the men." The guard
agreed eagerly. "You are quite right, your honour&mdash;and
I have said the same, even to my comrades. Why not be more
civil and polite to people before you shoot them? It is not
the shooting that makes so much bad feeling but treating
people like dogs."</p>

<p>The next time the guard was on duty A.J. received
back his note together with an answer. It was a verbal
one&mdash;merely a conventional 'Thank you,' which, though
not very enlightening, seemed, in the circumstances,
sufficient. He felt, anyhow, that something was being
accomplished. He knew that she was in a ground-floor cell
overlooking a yard which was patrolled by sentries day and
night. Any romantic escapade with ropes and ladders was
thus out of the question. The tobacco-smuggling guard,
whose name was Balkin, had stressed how carefully she was
watched, and after much thought and the formation of many
tentative plans, A.J. reached the conclusion that escape
could only take place, if at all, during some general
commotion that would temporarily upset the prison routine.
This, as clays passed, seemed more likely to happen, for
the clamour of the extremists increased and there were
strong rumours that at any moment Polakhin's writ might
cease to run. Then no doubt, there would be a brief civil
war, culminating in a mob-attack on the prison and the
massacre of its occupants.</p>

<p>A.J. argued thus: the attack on the prison would
probably take place at night, if only because at such
a time men's spirits were always most inflamed with
speechmaking and drink. The prison-guards might or might
not attempt any resistance, but in either case it was
unlikely that the regular routine of the sentry-patrol
would remain unaffected. Most likely there would be either
fighting or hilarious fraternisation. In the darkness
a good many of the invaders would not know where they
were, or where to look for the prisoners; there would be
confusion of all kinds. Most fortunately, as it happened,
the Countess's cell was among the last that could be
reached, being the end one in a long corridor. And let
into the corridor wall close by was an ordinary unbarred
window overlooking the yard. If only the prisoner were once
outside her cell, it would not be too difficult to climb
out through that window. A.J. did not wish to rely too
much on Balkin's assistance, for he did not seem a man of
either trustworthiness or intelligence; the only promise
to be exacted was that, as soon as there might be any hint
of trouble, he should slip a small revolver through the
bars of the cell. "You sec, Balkin, you are a kindhearted
fellow, and I don't mind telling you the truth&mdash;the
poor creature wishes to kill herself rather than fall
into the hands of the soldiers. Personally, I sympathise
with her in that, and you also, I am sure, will feel the
same. Is it not enough that she should die, without being
torn to pieces to amuse a crowd? Let her have a decent
death&mdash;the sort that a soldier, if he could choose,
would ask for." Balkin, greatly stirred, put his hand
sentimentally on A.J.'s shoulder. "You are quite right,
your honour. It is only fair that she should die properly.
Why, I will shoot her myself rather than let her fall into
the hands of those ruffians!"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;all you need do is to give her the
revolver. She is no coward, and would rather do the job in
her own way. It is more dignified&mdash;more seemly. Do you
not understand?"</p>

<p>Balkin at length and with great melancholy admitted that
he did understand; and he agreed also to take a further
message to the woman. A.J. wrote it out and handed it over
with the revolver.</p>

<p>That was in the morning; from all outward indications
the crisis was likely to develop that night. Polakhin
had already been openly insulted in the streets, and a
brutal loutish Jew named Aronstein had been haranguing the
crowd all afternoon. The actual <i>coup d'état</i> took place
about seven o'clock. Polakhin was arrested and Aronstein
duly 'elected' in his place. One by one all the official
buildings in the town went over to the extremist party,
and at last came the inevitable attack on the prison.
Aronstein had promised the attackers that not a single
counter-revolutionary life should be spared, and in such
a mood of anticipated blood-lust the mob surged round
the building. The guard at the entrance-gate offered no
resistance, and within a few moments the invaders were
pouring into the inner courtyard.</p>

<p>A.J., in a narrow lane behind the prison, waited with
keen anxiety. At first it seemed that the whole affair
was being conducted far too methodically, but soon the
traditional chaos of all insurgency began to be evident.
He could hear the shouts of the crowd; then he saw the
sentries suddenly run from their posts in the prison-yard,
from which the lane was separated only by tall iron
railings. That was his signal for action. He walked along
the railings quickly till he reached a certain spot;
then he halted and listened. There was a loud commotion
proceeding inside the prison&mdash;shoutings and screamings
and revolver-shots; it was difficult to judge exactly the
right moment. However, the lane looked quite deserted, and
in the darkness it would be hard to see him in any case. He
got hold of two of the iron railings and lifted them out
of their sockets. He knew from previous observation that
those particular railings were loose, for he had seen the
sentries lift them out to admit women into the yard.</p>

<p>He waited for several minutes, refusing rather than
unable to draw conclusions from what he could hear; he knew
that noise could mean anything and everything; he knew also
that Balkin was stupid and perhaps unreliable, that he
might do the totally wrong thing, or else just nothing at
all, either from error, slackness, or malice. He knew that
the chance he had planned for was fantastically slender,
that at a dozen points there were even odds of disaster.
And he knew, too, that even if the miracle did happen,
there were still further miracles to be accomplished in
leaving the town and reaching comparative safety.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he saw a dim and shadowy figure rushing
across the yard. He gave a loud cough; the figure stopped
for a fraction of a second, changed its direction
slightly, and came rushing towards him. He said softly:
"Here&mdash;here&mdash;through here. Wait&mdash;T must put
them back afterwards. Take this coat&mdash;I have another
underneath. Quickly&mdash;but keep calm. Are you hurt at
all?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You managed it all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I had to fire into the lock three
times&mdash;it's surprising how little damage a bullet can
do." She laughed quietly.</p>

<p>"Don't laugh. Don't talk either, now. Put your collar
up. If we meet anybody, we must be drunk. There are clothes
hidden in a field for you."</p>

<p>The greatcoat was useful in making her look, at any
considerable distance, like an ordinary Red soldier; at
any nearer encounter the semblance of drunkenness would
give them their best chance. A Red soldier, half tipsy,
taking a half-tipsy woman towards the outskirts of the town
was not an unusual sight, and for the woman to be wearing
a soldier's coat was common enough in days when currency
depreciation was making payment in kind increasingly
popular.</p>

<p>They passed several people on their way and the
stratagem seemed to succeed. One of the passers-by, a
soldier, called out to ask what was happening in the town;
A.J. replied, with fuddled intonation, that he rather
thought the prison was being attacked. "Ah," answered the
other, laughing, "but I see you've evidently got something
more important to do than join in, eh?" A.J. laughed, and
the woman laughed too, and they passed on.</p>

<p>They reached the end of the town and climbed over the
roadside into the fields. Hidden in a ditch were the
clothes he had carefully obtained and carefully placed in
position an hour before; it was a relief to find them, for
there had always been the possibility of their being found
and stolen in the interval. The clothes consisted of a more
or less complete military outfit, including top-boots and a
shabby peaked cap such as soldier or civilian might equally
be wearing.</p>

<p>"Well?" she whispered, as he showed them to her. "So I
am to be your obedient prisoner once again?"</p>

<p>He did not answer, except to urge her to dress quickly.
Her own clothes, as she discarded them, he rolled into a
bundle&mdash;it would not be safe to leave them behind. She
was very calm; that was a good thing, yet he wondered if
she realised that difficulties were beginning rather than
ending, and that in a short while hundreds of blood-drunken
searchers would be scouring the district for the escaped
White countess. One thing he was sure of&mdash;the peasant
disguise would never work a second time near Saratursk.
Everyone knew that she had escaped as a peasant before;
everyone would be prepared for the same disguise again.
There was only the slender chance that as two soldiers they
might escape through the cordon into safer country.</p>

<p>"Please hurry," he said again. "And we had better not
talk much."</p>

<p>"I'm ready now, except for the boots."</p>

<p>"Let me do them."</p>

<p>He knelt on one knee and laced them quickly.</p>

<p>She whispered, looking down at him in the darkness: "You
are very, very kind."</p>

<p>"It will be safer not to talk just yet&mdash;your
voice, you know. And when you do talk, you must call me
'<i>Tovarishch</i>'&mdash;it's the word the soldiers use. We
must be very careful, even in details."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. I understand. Now I'm ready."</p>

<p>"Good. We must try to get a long way into the forests by
daylight."</p>

<p>"Still <i>en route</i> for Moscow, I suppose?"</p>

<p>He answered, shouldering his bundle and helping her
quickly over the uneven ground: "No. I have decided to
accept your suggestion and will try to get you to the
coast, where you can take ship for abroad. Now don't answer
me&mdash;don't talk at all just save all your strength for
the long journey."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="part4"></a>PART IV</h2>

<p class="first">He stood on the summit of the first low
ridge that lifted out of the long level of the plains.
Dawn was creeping over the horizon; distant and below lay
the clustered roofs of the town. He and his companion
had stopped for but a moment, to share bread and water
together; she was so tired that she was already half asleep
on the springy turf.</p>

<p>He stared strangely upon that refreshing August dawn,
yet in his own mind, for some reason, he saw another
picture&mdash;a frozen Arctic river under sunshine, all
still and stiff, and then suddenly the splitting shiver of
the ice-crust and the surge of water over the quickening
land. He felt as if something like that were happening
within himself. "Come now," he said, picking up the
bundles. She was asleep and he had to waken her. She smiled
without a word and stumbled forward.</p>

<p>He dared not have allowed more than that moment's halt,
for though they had had good fortune so far, there was
still danger, and perhaps the greatest of all now that
daylight had come. They plunged on and on as the glow in
the eastern sky deepened and became glorified by sunrise;
over pine-covered ridges and down into little lonely
valleys, through swishing gullies of dead leaves and
round curving slopes whence Saratursk, glimpsed between
tree-trunks, seemed ever further away yet ever dangerously
near. By ten o'clock they had covered seven or eight miles,
and were already deep in the foothill forests; but she was
so tired that she could not take another step. There was
nothing for it but to rest for at least a few moments.
They sat on a fallen tree-trunk and she was asleep again
instantly, with her head leaning forward into her hands.</p>

<p>He was tired himself and after a short time, being
afraid of falling asleep also, he got up and moved about.
Ten minutes&mdash;a quarter of an hour&mdash;might be
enough to give her just the needful strength to scramble
a few miles further. Even during those few minutes, he
guessed, pursuers would be gaining on them. He had no
illusions or false optimism; he knew that the escape must
have been discovered within a few hours, at most, of its
taking place, and that immense efforts would certainly be
made to recapture such a fugitive. He had seen the whole
routine carried through so often before&mdash;a price
upon some prisoner, dead or alive&mdash;a whole army
setting out on perhaps the cruellest and therefore the
most intoxicatingly thrilling game in the world&mdash;a
man-hunt. And a woman-hunt would be even a degree better
than that. Then suddenly, even while he was pondering
over it, he heard, very faintly in the distance, a shrill
whistle, and, a few seconds later, a still fainter whistle
answering it. The hunt had begun already.</p>

<p>He touched the woman on the shoulder, but it was no
use&mdash;he had to shake her thoroughly to get her awake.
He said quietly: "We must hide for a time&mdash;I think
searchers are somewhere in the woods." She answered in a
dazed way: "All right. I'm ready." He helped her to her
feet and they moved away, he with eyes alert for a good
hiding-place.</p>

<p>He was fortunate in finding one quite soon. A steep
valley ended in a lame and desolate tract of undergrowth
amidst whose tangle there seemed a good chance of escaping
notice. Even if pursuers ever reached it, they would
not be likely to give every thicket the attention it
deserved. He plunged eagerly into the bushes and for ten
minutes, out of sight of the world around them, they both
wriggled further and deeper into the dense undergrowth. At
last the seemingly perfect spot revealed itself&mdash;a
little hollow hidden behind thick brambles and knee-deep
in litter of twigs and leaves. "Here," he cried, with
sudden satisfaction. He stared thankfully about him at the
protecting foliage, and then upwards at the blue sky just
visible through the lacery of branches. Then he heard once
again, but a little nearer, that shrill whistle and its
answer.</p>

<p>He laid her gently on the ground and yet again she
fell asleep instantly&mdash;so instantly that he smiled a
rather rueful smile, for he had intended to give her some
cautionary advice. No matter; it could probably wait. He
would not think of wakening her. And then as the moments
passed and he watched her sleeping, a feeling of tenderness
came over him, like a slow warmth from another world,
and he did something he had never done before in all his
life&mdash;he put his arm round a woman and drew her gently
towards him. She would sleep more comfortably so. He gazed
on her with quiet, almost proprietary triumph; all the way
from Khalinsk he had not ceased to guard her, through all
manner of difficulty and peril, and here she was still, by
miracle, under his protection. He was hungry and thirsty
and tired and anxious, yet also, in a way he had never
known before, he was satisfied.</p>

<p>The thicket was noisy with buzzing insects, but
every few moments over the distant air came the
whistling&mdash;now quite distinctly nearer. His heart beat
no faster for it; he felt: We are here, and here is our
only chance; we must wait and take whatever comes... The
nearest of the pursuers, he judged, must be perhaps half
a mile away; there were others, too, not far behind, and
probably hundreds already combing the forests on the way
from Saratursk. Soon the whistling became less intermittent
and seemed to come from north and south as well as west;
once, too, he thought he heard voices a long way off.
Hunger and thirst were now beginning to be importunate, but
he dared not satisfy them, since it might be night before
he could risk leaving the thicket in quest of any fresh
supplies.</p>

<p>Then he saw that her eyes were wide open&mdash;dark,
sleepy eyes staring up at him. She whispered, half smiling:
"How uncomfortable you must be&mdash;with me leaning on you
like this!"</p>

<p>"All the better," he answered, with a wry smile. "It
helps me to keep awake."</p>

<p>"I think it is your turn to sleep now."</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;you go on sleeping."</p>

<p>"But I <i>can't</i>." Her voice dropped agonisingly.
"I've kept my nerve pretty well up to now, but I'm
afraid&mdash;I'm beginning to be just&mdash;terrified."</p>

<p>"Terrified? Oh, no need for that."</p>

<p>"Those whistles that keep on sounding&mdash;we're being
hunted&mdash;that's what they mean, don't they?"</p>

<p>"They're looking for us, of course. That was to be
expected. But it doesn't follow that they're going to find
us."</p>

<p>"Promise me&mdash;promise me one thing&mdash;that you'll
kill me rather than let them get me again!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I promise."</p>

<p>"You mean it?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>A whistle suddenly shrilled quite close to
them&mdash;perhaps two or three hundred yards away, on the
edge of the undergrowth. Even he was startled, and he felt
her trembling silently against him. He whispered: "Keep
calm&mdash;they're a long way off yet&mdash;they might
easily come within ten yards and not see us in a place like
this. Don't worry."</p>

<p>All she could muster, amidst her fear was: "You have
your revolver? You remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>His arm tightened upon leer; he whispered: "Poor child,
don't give up hope." Then they both waited in silence. It
seemed an age until the next whistle&mdash;an answering one
that appeared to come from about the same distance on the
other side. What was happening was not very clear; perhaps
the two searchers were passing along the edges of the
undergrowth and did not intend to make any detailed search
amongst it. He could imagine their condition&mdash;tired,
hot, thirsty, and probably bad-tempered after the so far
fruitless search. The prickly brambles would hardly tempt
them. On the other hand, there was the big reward that had
most likely been offered&mdash;men would do most things for
a few hundred roubles.</p>

<p>After a short time it was evident that the searchers
numbered far more than two; whistling proceeded from every
direction, and sounded rather as if fresh searchers were
coming up at every moment. Then came echoes of shouting and
talking, but voices did not carry very well and he could
not catch any words. He judged, however, that some sort
of a consultation was in progress. Next followed a chorus
of whistling and counter-whistling from both sides, the
meaning of which was only too easy to guess.</p>

<p>"They're coming through!" she gasped.</p>

<p>He whispered: "I daresay they've got the sense to
realise that this is a good place to hide. And so it
is, too. There are so many of them there's bound to be
over-lapping and confusion. Keep calm. We've still a good
chance." The approach of almighty danger gave him a feeling
of exaltation as difficult to understand as to control.
He went on, a moment later: "Leaves&mdash;these leaves. A
childish trick, but it might work. I want you to lie down
in this hollow and let me cover you up."</p>

<p>"Yes, if you wish."</p>

<p>He placed her so that, with the leaves over her, there
seemed no break in the level ground. The whistling by this
time was very much nearer, and there could be heard also
the tearing and breaking of twigs as some of the searchers
broke through. He whispered: "Keep still&mdash;don't move
or say a word. And whatever happens, trust me and don't be
surprised. Whatever happens, mind." A moment afterwards
the tousled head of a Red soldier, streaked with dirt and
perspiration, pushed itself through the undergrowth a few
yards away. A.J. did not wait to be accosted. Wiping his
forehead with his sleeve and kicking up some of the litter
of twigs, he shouted: "Hallo? Found anything yet? There's
nothing here."</p>

<p>The man answered: "Nor here either, <i>Tovarishch</i>. It's
my belief she didn't go into the forest at all. And if she
did, she wouldn't have got so far as this. It's a terrible
job, searching through this sort of country on a hot
day."</p>

<p>A J. agreed sympathetically. "You're right, my
friend&mdash;its the devil's own job. And I've lost my
whistle too, confound it."</p>

<p>The other laughed. "Never mind, I'll whistle for you."
He gave two mighty blasts. "That'll show we've done <i>our</i>
duty, anyway. Have a drink with me, Tovarishch, and It's
get out of this muddle."</p>

<p>A.J. accepted the offer by no means ungratefully, for he
wanted the drink badly enough. The soldier seemed a simple,
good-natured fellow, with a childishness, however, that
was quite capable of being dangerous. "You were with the
other lot, I suppose?" he queried, and A.J. nodded. They
struggled through the thickets and reached at last the open
ground. There a few other soldiers were already gathered
together, evidently satisfied that they had performed their
share of the search. They were all rather disgruntled.
It was a ticklish moment when A.J. joined them, but his
highest hopes were realised; there had been a tremendous
amount of confusion and no man expected to know his
neighbour. The chief concern of all was the food and drink
due to arrive from the forests below.</p>

<p>A.J. found them a friendly lot of men, behind their
temporary ill-humour; he soon learned that they had been
promised a large reward for the discovery of the escaped
Countess, and that the latter, if captured alive, was to be
accorded a solemn full-dress execution in the market-place
at Saratursk. "She will be hanged, not shot," said one of
the men, rolling a cigarette between grimy fingers. And he
added contemplatively: "It is a pity, in some ways, to hang
a woman, because their necks are made differently. I am a
hangman by profession, and I can speak from knowledge."</p>

<p>Soon a few men came toiling up the valley with sacks
of bread and buckets of thin potato-soup. The searchers
greeted them boisterously, relieved them of their burdens,
and began to eat and drink ravenously. A.J. and his tousled
companion, whose name was Stefanov, managed to secure a
loaf of black bread between them, as well as a large can
of soup. Stefanov was not astonished that A.J. knew none
of the men. "That is the worst of the army nowadays," he
said. "They shift you about so quickly that you never get
to know anybody. It was different in the old days when
there were proper regiments." He went on chatting away in a
manner most helpful to A.J. "I suppose all the others have
got lost&mdash;that's what usually happens. I only know one
of the fellows here by name. That's little Nikolay Rusilov
over there. Do you see him? That man snoring against that
tree-trunk." A.J. looked and observed. "I can tell you a
secret, Tovarishch, about that man&mdash;and though you'll
hardly believe it, I assure you it's the heavenly truth and
nothing less." He dropped his voice to a hoarse whisper.
"That man was once kissed by the Emperor."</p>

<p>A.J. made some surprised and enquiring remark and
Stefanov went on, pleased with his little sensation: "Ah,
I guessed that would startle you! Well, you see, it all
happened like this. Nikolay was doing sentry duty one
night outside a railway train in which the Emperor was
sleeping. The train was drawn up in a siding, and it was
Easter Sunday morning&mdash;in the old clays, of course.
You know the custom&mdash;you kiss the first person you
meet and give the Easter greeting. Well, Nikolay was the
first person the Emperor met that morning when he stepped
out of the train, so the Emperor kissed him. Isn't that
remarkable? And you would hardly think it to look at him,
would you?"</p>

<p>Many of the men had already fallen to dozing in the
shade, but Stefanov's conversation showed no signs of
early abatement. A.J. was not wholly sorry, for the man's
garrulous chatter gave him much information that he guessed
might be of value in the immediate future. At last, towards
the late afternoon, an officer appeared on the edge of the
scene and gave leisurely instruction to the half-sleeping
men. They were to form themselves into detachments and
march back to Saratursk. Evidently the search, for that
day, at any rate, was being abandoned.</p>

<p>A.J.'s problem, of course, was to escape from the
soldiers without attracting attention, and there were
many ways in which he hoped to be able to do so. Having,
however, been given such incredible good fortune so far,
he was determined to take no unnecessary risks, and he saw
no alternative to accompanying the men for some distance,
at least, on their march back to the town. He and Stefanov
walked together, or rather, Stefanov followed him with
a species of dog-like attachment which threatened to be
highly inconvenient in the circumstances. The retreat began
about six o'clock and dusk fell as the stragglers were
still threading their way amongst the pine-trees. From time
to time as they descended, other parties of soldiers joined
them&mdash;all tired and rather low-spirited. But for the
too pertinacious Stefanov, it would have been a simple
matter to slip away in the twilit confusion of one or other
of these encounters. At last, however, when the last tint
of daylight had almost left the sky, an opportunity did
come. Stefanov halted to take off his boot and beat in a
protruding nail; A.J. said he would go ahead and see how
far they had still to go. He went ahead, but he did not
return, and he hoped that Stefanov would realise that,
in the darkness, nothing was more likely than that two
companions, once separated, should be unable to find each
other again.</p>

<p>A.J. waited till the last faint sounds of the retreating
men had died away in the distance; some were singing and
could be heard for a long time. Then he took deep breaths
of the cool pine-laden air and tried to induce in himself
a calm and resourceful confidence. He took careful note
of his bearings; the stars and the rising moon and the
slope of the ground were all helpful guides. His Siberian
experiences had made him uncannily expert at that sort of
thing; with a night lasting for nine months it had been
necessary to train the senses to work efficiently in the
dark. Still, it was not going to be an easy task to locate
the exact whereabouts of that valley wilderness. During the
journey with Stefanov he had tried to memorise the ground
passed over, and he had counted five successive ridges that
they had crossed.</p>

<p>Cautiously he climbed to the summit of the first ridge.
There moonlight helped him by showing a vague outline of
the next one. He paused a moment to munch a little bread
he had managed to save; there was still some left. At the
next stream he filled his water-bottle to the brim. On the
top of the second ridge he saw cigarette wrappings that had
been thrown away by the soldiers, and that was heartening,
for it showed that he was in the right direction. Twice
after that he imagined he was lost, and the second time
he had just decided to stay where he was until dawn,
when he caught a distant glimpse of a pale clearing that
seemed somehow familiar. He walked towards it, and there,
glossy under the moonlight, lay that steep valley with the
wilderness of thickets like a dark velvet patch at the
upper end of it. He stumbled over the turf with tingling
excitement in his blood, and all at once and surprisingly
for the first time the thought came to him that she might
not be there. What if she were not? If she had grown tired
or terrified of waiting&mdash;if she had wildly sought
to escape on her own&mdash;if she had lost hope of his
ever returning? He gave a low whistle across the empty
valley, and at once a hundred voices answered, so that
he shivered almost in fear himself. Then he smiled; they
were only owls. He reached the edge of the thickets and
plunged into them, not caring that the brambles tore at
his clothes and face and hands. In a little while he dared
to speak&mdash;he shouted softly: "I'm coming&mdash;don't
be afraid&mdash;I'm coming. Tell me where you are." And a
voice, very weary and remote, answered him.</p>

<p>When he came at last to that little hollow of
dead leaves she sprang up and clung to him with
both arms, sobbing and laughing at the same time.
"Darling&mdash;darling," she whispered hysterically, and
he felt all the ice in his soul break suddenly into the
flow of spring. "Were you thinking I wouldn't come?" he
stammered, dazed with the glory of her welcome. She could
not answer, but she was all at once calmed. Then he stooped
and kissed her lips, and they were like the touch of sleep
itself. "You must be so tired," she said, and he answered:
"I am&mdash;yes, I am." There was a curious serenity about
her that made him feel a child again&mdash;a child to whom
most things are simple and marvellous.</p>

<p>They shared food and water and then lay down together on
the bed of leaves until morning.</p>

<p>The chorus of birds awoke him at sunrise; he looked up
and saw the blue sky between the branches and then looked
down and saw her sleeping. He memorised her features as he
might have done the contours of some friendly, familiar
land; he saw her wide, round eyelids, and her slender nose,
and her lips a little parted as she slept. He wondered if
she were really beautiful, as one may wonder if a loved
scene is really beautiful; for to him, as she lay there,
she meant so much more than beauty. He saw her as the
centre of a universe, and all else&mdash;those years of
exile and loneliness and wandering&mdash;dissolved into
background.</p>

<p>Then, as if aware that he was thinking about her so
intensely, she wakened and smiled.</p>

<p>They finished what remained of the food and then talked
over what was to be done next. Their immediate aim, of
course, was to get as far away as possible from Saratursk,
and for this the soldier disguise seemed the safest,
though later it might be advisable to drop it. Even more
pressing might soon be problems of food and shelter, since
they could not expect to leave the forest for several
days and the warm and dry weather had already lasted
exceptionally.</p>

<p>As they set out under the trees that early morning
they talked as they had never done before&mdash;about
themselves, She told him of her family, of which, she
believed, she might be the only survivor: her mother was
dead; her father and two brothers had certainly been
killed by the Reds; and among other relatives there were
few whom she could be sure were still alive. They had all,
of course, lost their money and possessions. Almost as an
afterthought she told him that she had been married, and
that her husband had been killed in Galicia fighting the
Austrians. "Almost as soon as the war began, that was. We
had been married four years, but we had no children. I am
glad."</p>

<p>She continued: "I stayed on our estates as long as I
could; I never believed our old servants would turn against
me, but they did, in the end&mdash;they were intimidated,
no doubt. Then there seemed nothing left but to clear out
of the country altogether, which my friends had been urging
me to do for a Ion, while. A few of them who were plotting
against the Reds asked for my support, and I gave it to
some extent, but my real desire was to get away&mdash;out
of it all&mdash;utterly. When I was taken prisoner I was
terribly disappointed at first, as you can imagine. Then a
mood came on me in which nothing seemed to matter at all.
Even when I tried to bribe you and you refused, I didn't
find myself caring very much. But now I'm beginning to care
again&mdash;a little&mdash;and it hurts&mdash;it's really
more convenient not to have any hopes and fears. But I
want to live&mdash;oh, I do want us both to live&mdash;we
<i>must</i>&mdash;mustn't we?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, and the word, as he uttered it,
seemed a keystone set upon his life. Then he began to tell
her, quite simply and dispassionately, of his own years of
exile, though not of anything previous to that. As it was,
the accounting was like turning old keys in rusty locks; to
no one ever before had he spoken of those bitter years that
had frozen his soul with their silence just as hers had
been numbed by grief.</p>

<p>All morning they trudged from ridge to ridge, skirting
Saratursk at a wide radius, and then making in a southwest
direction. He kept a continually watchful look-out, for he
thought it more than possible that the Reds would resume
their search of the forests. Nobody, however, appeared
within sight until mid-afternoon, when they saw, far off
on a hillside, a man gathering small timber for fuel. They
were so hungry by then that A.J. took the risk of walking
up to him and, posing as a soldier who had lost his way,
asking to buy food and drink. The man was quite cordial,
and took A.J. to his tiny cottage half a mile away, where
he lived with his wife and a large family amidst conditions
of primitive savagery. It seemed a pity to take food from
such people, but the man was glad to sell eggs, tea, and
bread at the prices A.J. offered. It was hard, indeed, to
escape from his good-natured friendliness, and especially
from his offer to show the way in person for few had
been made when A.J.'s desire to be unaccompanied almost
offensively clear, the man's puzzlement changed to a gust
of amusement. "Ah, I begin to see how it is, comrade,"
he chuckled. "You have a woman waiting for you out there
in the woods, eh? Oh, don't be afraid&mdash;I shan't say
anything! You're not the first soldier who's deserted the
Red army and taken to the hills with a woman. But I'll
give you this bit of advice&mdash;if you do happen to meet
anyone else at the same game, be careful&mdash;for they
shoot at sight. They're wild as wolves, many of' em."</p>

<p>A.J. thanked the fellow and was glad to walk away with
an armful of food and nothing worse than a roar of laughter
behind him. When he rejoined his companion they continued
their walk for a mile or so and then sat down to eat,
drink, and rest. It was already late afternoon and they had
had nothing since the few crusts of bread at early morning.
A.J. now gathered sticks for a small fire, on which he
boiled eggs and made tea. The resulting meal lifted them
both to an extraordinary pitch of happiness; as they sat
near the smoking embers while the first mists of twilight
dimmed the glades, a strange peacefulness fell upon them,
and they both knew, even without speaking, that neither
would have chosen to be anywhere else in the world. All
around them lay enemies; to-morrow might see them captured,
imprisoned, or dead; there might be horror in the future to
balance all the horrors of the past; yet the tiny oasis of
the present, with themselves at the core of it, was a sheer
glow of perfection.</p>

<p>They were so tired that they did not move before
darkness came, and then merely lay clown on the brown
leaves. The evening air was chilly, and they clung together
for warmth with their two great-coats huddled over them.
All the small and friendly sounds of the forest wrapped
them about: an owl hooted very far away; a mouse rustled
through the near undergrowth; a twig broke suddenly aloft
and fell with a tiny clatter to the ground. She kissed him
with a grave, peaceful passion that seemed a living part of
all the copious, cordial nature that surrounded them; they
hardly spoke; to love seemed as simple and as speechless
as to be hungry and thirsty and tired. That night he could
almost have blessed the chaos that had brought them both,
out of a whole world, together.</p>

<p>On the fifth day they fell in with a peasant who told
them of a quick way into the plains. He was a bent and
gnarled fellow of an age that looked to be anything between
sixty and eighty, and with the manner of one to whom
Bolshevism and revolution were merely the pranks of a young
and foolish generation. He was full of chatter, and told
A.J. all his family affairs, besides pointing to a small
timbered roof on a distant hillside that was his own. He
had left a sick daughter alone in that hut with five small
children; her husband was a soldier, fighting somewhere
or other&mdash;or perhaps dead&mdash;no news had been
received for many months. "Of course he will never come
back&mdash;they never do. She has had no baby now for over
two years&mdash;is it not dreadful? And she would make a
good wife for any man when she is in good health&mdash;oh
yes, a very good wife."</p>

<p>A.J. made some sympathetic remark and the old man
continued: "But what are young men nowadays? Mere
adventurers pretending to want to see the world! What
is the world, after all? When you have seen one forest
you have seen them all, and one field is very much like
another. I myself am quite happy to have been no further
than Vremarodar, seventy versts away." He chuckled amidst
the odorous depths of a heavy matted beard and still
continued: "I don't suppose you'd ever guess my age,
either, brother. I'm a hundred and three, though people
don't always believe me when I tell them. You see my
youngest daughter's only thirty-five, and people say it's
impossible." He chuckled again, "but it isn't impossible,
I assure you&mdash;I'm not the sort of fellow to tell you
a lie. Why, look at me now, still fit and hearty, as you
can see, and if there was a pretty woman about, and my
honour as a man depended on it, I don't know but what..."
His chuckles boiled over into resonant laughter. "Mind
you, I'm not what I used to be, by a long way, and I think
it's a girl's duty to look after her father when he lives
to be my age, don't you? She's not a bad girl, you know,
but she's inclined to be lazy and I have to thrash her now
and again. Not that I like doing it, but women&mdash;well,
you know all about them, I daresay. Ah well, there's your
path&mdash;it leads out into a long valley and at the
end of that there are the plains as far as you can sec.
Good-day to you, brother, and to you too, madam."</p>

<p>The next day they reached the edge of the forests
and saw the plains stretching illimitably into the hazy
distance. But before descending, it was necessary to make
arrangements. It was certain that they would meet many
strangers once they left the hillsides, and with the
prospect, too, of colder weather, they could no longer rely
on sleeping out of doors. A soldier's disguise, for the
woman especially, seemed therefore likely to be a source
of danger, and A.J. decided that it would be Better for
them to resume their peasant roles. In his own case the
change was inconsiderable, since so many peasants wore army
clothes whenever they could acquire them; and as for Daly,
she had only to change into the female attire that she had
been carrying with her all the way from Saratursk.</p>

<p>The change was made, and on the seventh day, very
early in the morning, they left the forests. The sky was
fine, but clouds were already massing on the horizon for
a thunderstorm that would doubtless Tiring to an end the
long spell of fine weather. It was still hard to make
more than the sketchiest plan of campaign. Amidst those
lonely Ural foothills there had been an atmosphere of being
out of the world, removed from many of its bewilderments
and troubled by nothing more complicated than the
elemental problem of the hunted eluding the hunter. In
the plains, however, all problems were subtler and more
intricate&mdash;as intricate, at least, as the political
and military situation of the country generally. At
Saratursk, before the escape, A.J. had tried to visualise
what was happening as a whole, and not merely locally, but
it had been difficult owing to the wildness of the rumours
that gained credence. Every morning there had come a fresh
crop of them&mdash;that the German Kaiser had committed
suicide, that Lenin had been shot in Moscow by a young
girl, that a British army was invading from Archangel,
that the Japanese were approaching from the east along the
line of the Trans-Siberian; there had been no lack of such
sensational news, much of which was always more likely to
be false than true. It seemed, however, fairly probable
that Czecho-Slovak detachments were by this time in full
occupation of great lengths of the Trans-Siberian, and it
was also possible (as rumour alleged) that they had pushed
up the Volga and captured Sembirsk and Kazan. The repulse
of the Whites from Saratursk would appear, in that case,
to have been a merely isolated and local affair&mdash;as
local, in fact, as the Red Terror that had followed it. But
then, all Russia was seething with such local affairs, and
the history of the whole country could scarcely be more
than the sum-total of them. A village here might be Red, or
there White, and a stranger could hardly tell which until
he took the risk of entering it. The Czechs, despite their
imposing position on the map, held merely the thin line of
the railway; a few versts on either side of the track their
sway ended, and the brigandage of Red and White soldiery
went on without interruption.</p>

<p>So much A.J. had in mind, though there was little he
knew for certain. If there had been any fixed battle-line
between Red and White, it would have been a straightforward
task, despite the danger of it, to make for the nearest
point of that line and cross over. As it was, however,
there could be no advantage in joining up with some small
and local White colony which, in a few days or weeks, might
surrender to the Reds and be massacred.</p>

<p>The two of them talked the matter over during that early
morning descent to the plains, and she said at length,
putting it far more concisely than he would care to have
done: "The whole question is really&mdash;am I to escape
alone, or are you to come with me? You are to come with me,
of course, and that means we must go right away&mdash;out
of the whole area of these local wars." Then she looked
at him and laughed rather queerly. "Oh, it all comes to
this, I suppose, that what I want more than anything in
the world is to be with you. Can't You believe me? In a
way I'm enjoying every minute of all this&mdash;it's an
adventure I don't want ever to end; but if it must end,
then let anything end it rather than separation. Promise
that wherever we go and whatever happens to us, it will be
together!"</p>

<p>"That is all I hoped you would say," he answered. "We
will make south for the railway, then, and take a train,
if there are trains, towards Kazan. And there, if the
situation remains the same, we can join the Czechs."</p>

<p>The hill country ended with disconcerting abruptness;
by noon they were crossing land so level that it looked
like a sea, with the horizon of hills as a coastline in the
rearward distance. It was dizzily hot; the threatened storm
had passed over with a few abortive thunderclaps. The earth
was caked and splitting after weeks without rain; dust
filled eyes and nostrils at the slightest breath of wind;
the crops were withering in the unharvested fields.</p>

<p>As distance increased between themselves and the
mountains, they found tracks widening into roads, and roads
becoming more frequented. Every side-track yielded its
stragglers, most of whom were peasants carrying all their
worldly goods on their backs. Where they had come from
and where they were bound for were problems that were no
more soluble after, as often happened, they had unburdened
their secrets to the passing stranger. But many were too
ill and dejected even to give the usual greeting as they
passed, and some showed all the outward signs of prolonged
hardships and semi-starvation.</p>

<p>For every passer-by in the opposite direction there were
at least a dozen, bound, like themselves, for the railway
twenty miles to the south. The chance of getting aboard a
train did not, in such circumstances, seem very promising,
and still less attractive was the prospect of camping out
for days or weeks on the railway platforms, as thousands of
refugees were doing. A.J. learned this from a youth with
whom, along the road, he effected an exchange of a couple
of eggs in return for a small quantity of butter made
from sunflower-seeds. The boy&mdash;for he was scarcely
more&mdash;seemed so knowledgeable and intelligent that
A.J. was glad enough to agree when he suggested pooling
resources for a small roadside meal. The stranger hardly
got the better of the bargain, since his own provender
included white bread (an almost incredible luxury) and
part of a cooked chicken; but he only laughed when A.J.
apologised. He was a merry, pink-checked youth, eager
to treat A.J. with roguish bonhomie and the woman with
a touch of gallantry. He was eighteen, he said, and his
life had been fairly adventurous. At sixteen he had been a
cadet in an Imperial training-school for officers, but the
Revolution had happened just in time to fit in conveniently
with his own reluctance to die in a trench fighting the
Germans. He seemed also to have quarrelled with his family,
for he said he neither knew nor cared what had happened
to them. He had joined the revolutionaries at the age of
seventeen, doubtless to save his own skin, and in a single
year had risen to be a military commissar. But even that,
in the end, had become too tedious and exacting, for in his
heart he had always pined for something more individually
adventurous. Presently he had found it. He had become a
train-bandit. He admitted this quite frankly, and with
a joyous taking of risks in so doing. "It suits me," he
explained, "because I'm a bad lot&mdash;I always was."</p>

<p>It appeared that he had been the leader of a group of
bandits operating on the Chelyabinsk-Ufa line before the
advance of the Czechs had put an end to such enterprise.
His colleagues had since dispersed, and he himself was now
at a loose end, but he rather thought there was a good
chance of successful banditry on the Yekaterinburg-Sarapul
line, which was still to a large extent in the hands of the
Reds. All he needed were 'a few suitable companions; the
rest would be easy. There was a steep incline not far away
where west-bound trains always slowed down. One man could
jump into the engine-cab and make the driver pull up; the
others would then go through the train, coach by coach and
compartment by compartment. It was the usual and almost
always successful method. A.J. expressed surprise that the
passengers, many of whom were doubtless well armed, did
not put up a fight. The boy laughed. "You must remember
that it's in the middle of the night, when most of them are
asleep and none of them feel particularly brave. Besides,
some of them do try their tricks, but we try ours first. If
you shoot straight once you don't often have any trouble
with the rest." He spoke quite calmly, and not without a
certain half-humorous relish. "After all," he then went on,
as if feeling instinctively some need to defend himself,
"it's not a bad death&mdash;being shot. Better than
starvation or typhus. A good many people in this country, I
should reckon, have got to die pretty soon, and the lucky
ones are those that get a bullet through the heart." Looked
at in such a way, the situation undoubtedly showed him in
the guise of a public benefactor. And he added: "I suppose
you don't feel you're the sort of fellow to join forces
with me?"</p>

<p>When A.J. smiled and shook his head, the boy smiled back
quite amicably. "That's all right&mdash;only I thought I'd
just put it to you. You look the sort of man I'd like to
work with, that's all. Anyhow, I can help you with a bit
of advice. There's not a thousand to one chance of your
getting on board a train at Novochensk. The station's
already cram-full. But if you go about three versts
to the east you'll come to that incline I was talking
about&mdash;where the trains all slow up. There you might
manage it."</p>

<p>"I suppose the trains are full too."</p>

<p>"Absolutely, but they'll make room for you and your
lady if you shout that you've got food. Show them a loaf
of bread and they'll pull you into the cars even if they
murder you afterwards."</p>

<p>A.J. thanked him for the excellent-sounding advice, and
after a little further conversation the eighteen-year-old
bandit shouldered his bundle and departed. Following his
suggestion, they reached the railway late that evening
at a point a few miles east of the railway station. It
was too dark to see exactly where they were, and they
were just preparing to sleep on the parched ground until
morning when, from the very far distance, came the sound
of a train. It was a weird noise amidst the silence of the
steppes&mdash;rather like the breathing of a very tired and
aged animal. Once or twice, as the wind veered away, the
sound disappeared altogether for a time, and they listened
for it intermittently for nearly half an hour before they
first saw the tiny sparkle of a headlight on the horizon.
They perceived then that they were on the ridge of some low
downs, which the train would have to surmount&mdash;that,
presumably, being the incline they had been told about.
And soon, to confirm this assumption, the breathing of the
engine became a kind of hoarse pant as the rising gradient
was encountered. More and more asthmatic grew the panting,
until, with a sudden sigh, it ceased altogether, and a
sharp jangle of brakes showed that the train was locked at
a standstill.</p>

<p>"Let's walk down," A.J. said, rapidly gathering up the
bundles. "They might take us on board&mdash;at any rate, we
can try."</p>

<p>They walked along the track down the noticeable slope;
evidently the builders of the line had been unable to
afford the evening out of the gradient by means of cutting
and embankment. The train, as they approached it, looked in
some commotion, and to avoid being seen too clearly in the
glare of the headlight they made a detour into the fields
and returned to the track opposite the third vehicle. They
could see now that the train was composed of some dozen
box-cars of refugees and a single ordinary passenger-coach
next to the engine.</p>

<p>Scores of heads peered at them through the slats of the
cars, and several occupants, evidently taking A.J. for
some wayside railway official, enquired why the train had
stopped. A.J. said he thought it was because the engine
could not manage the hill, and then, feeling that nothing
was to be lost by broaching the matter immediately, added:
"I have a little bread and some tea and sugar&mdash;could
you make room for just the two of us?"</p>

<p>"We cannot," answered several, which did not sound
unreasonable in view of the fact that men were even perched
on the buffers between the cars. One or two voices,
however, began to ask how much tea and sugar he had.</p>

<p>The whole colloquy was then sharply interrupted by the
sound of shots proceeding from the passenger-coach. At
once women began to shout and scream, and a few of the men
standing on the buffers actually dropped to the ground and
hid themselves beneath the cars. Other shots followed in
rapid succession; then suddenly a group of men appeared
out of the darkness, brandishing weapons and shouting. One
carried a lantern and flashed it in A.J.'s face, exclaiming
in had Russian: "What are you doing here? Didn't you hear
the order that no one was to get out?"</p>

<p>A.J. explained with an appropriate mixture of eloquence
and simplicity that they hadn't got out, and that, on the
contrary, they were a couple of poor peasants trying their
best to get in.</p>

<p>Another man then joined in the argument; he was clearly
for shooting the two of them out of hand, but first man
restrained him with some difficulty. "They are only
peasants," he said, and turning to A.J., added: "You say
you were only looking for a place on the train?"</p>

<p>A.J. assured him that this was so, and just as he had
finished, a soft, rather plaintive voice from the car
above them cried out: "Yes, he is speaking the truth, your
honour&mdash;they were offering us tea and sugar if we
would make room for them."</p>

<p>The man with the lantern grunted sharply. "Tea and
sugar, eh? Come on&mdash;hand them over." Obedience seemed
advisable in the circumstances, and A.J. yielded up his
precious commodities; after which the men, with a few final
shouts, hurried away into the darkness, leaving the couple
standing there by the side of the train, unharmed, but
bereft of their most potent bargaining power.</p>

<p>After a judicious interval the occupants of the train
took courage and set up a chorus of loud and indignant
protests. The engine-whistle began a continuously
ear-piercing screech, while from the passenger-coach sprang
half a-dozen Red soldiers, armed with rifles and fixed
bayonets. It soon became known that the bandits had run off
with a large quantity of money and had also killed two Red
guards on the train. The survivors, to excuse themselves,
estimated the number of bandits at twenty, but A.J. did not
think there could have been more than half that number.</p>

<p>Rather oddly the crowd of harassed and scared refugees
were now inclined to show sympathy towards A.J. and his
companion. "They were going to share their tea and sugar
with us," said the man with the plaintive voice. And
another man said: "It's all very well to kill the soldiers
and steal the money, but to take away a poor man's food is
something to be really ashamed of. Climb up, friends, and
we'll make room for you somehow."</p>

<p>So A.J. and Daly got aboard the train after all.
There was hardly a square foot of space, and they were
huddled together against the dirtiest and most odorous
fellow-travellers, but there they were, as they had dreamed
of being for many days&mdash;on board a train that would
take them a further stage on their journey.</p>

<p>It was dawn, however, before the train started. In
despair of surmounting the hill from a standstill, the
engine-driver reversed for a mile or so and tried to take
the gradient by storm. The manoeuvre failed, and the train
was again reversed. This time the order was given for all
able-bodied men to get out and push the cars over the crest
of the rise, and by this means, with many snortings and
splutterings, the train did finally crawl over the summit.
There was then a further long wait while the pushers
regained their places, and it was not till an hour after
sunrise that the train steamed into Novochensk station,
less than three miles from the scene of the hold-up.</p>

<p>A first view of Novochensk proved to A.J. how fortunate,
after all, had been the boy-bandit's advice. The station
was packed from end to end of its large platforms and
freight-yards, and the train, as it entered, seemed to push
a way through the crowd like a vehicle threading through a
fair-ground. Added, of course, to the normal pandemonium
that the arrival of any train would have caused, was the
extra sensation arising out of the hold-up. There was much
agitated shouting and gesticulation among the railway
officials as the bodies of the shot soldiers were removed
from the train. The remaining soldiers had already revised
their earlier estimate of the number of attackers; it was
now reckoned about a hundred.</p>

<p>Scarcely any of those waiting at Novochensk succeeded
in getting a place on the train, and those already in
occupation dared not move for fear of losing their own
places. The station, too, was without food, and many of
the refugees had had nothing to eat for several days. Even
water was scarce, owing to the prolonged drought, and when
buckets were handed into the cars, there was barely enough
to give each occupant a single quick gulp.</p>

<p>The train left Novochensk shortly before midday,
and amidst the drowsy torpidity of the afternoon A.J.
had plenty of time and opportunity to observe his
fellow-passengers. There were perhaps fifty or sixty of
them squatting on the floor of the box-car; many were
leaning against each other and trying to sleep, and the
whole effect was rather that of a litter of old rags. There
was just enough talk and movement, however, to indicate
that the litter was alive, and there was certainly ample
liveliness of another kind. A.J. and Daly, whose clothes
had been fairly clean on entering, shared the common
misfortune during the first half-hour.</p>

<p>Here and there, and from time to time, some isolated
phenomenon detached itself from that jumble of rags,
chatter, and drowsiness; a baby cried; a woman opened her
blouse and exposed a drooping shrunken breast-' man groaned
heavily as he stirred in sleep; the train lurched over a
bad patch of line and drew a sigh, a curse, or a muttered
exclamation from every corner of that strange assembly.
The sunlight, shining through the wooden slats, made a
flickering febrile patchwork of the whole picture, showing
up here a piece of gaudy-coloured cloth, there a greasy,
dirt-stained face, and everywhere, like a veil drawn in
front of reality, the smoke rising from the men's coarse
tobacco and the myriad particles of dust.</p>

<p>The speed of travel was very slow&mdash;never more than
ten miles an hour, and oftener no more than five; nor could
anything be seen outside save that vast, vacant expanse
of brown earth, on which the horizon seemed to press like
a heavy, brazen rim. Miles passed without sight of a
habitation, while nothing moved over the emptiness save
swirls of dust and curlews scared by the train.</p>

<p>Actually she whispered to him as she leaned against
the curve of his arm: "Oh, I'm happy&mdash;I'm happy. I'm
beginning to have hope. When do you think we shall reach
Kazan?"</p>

<p>"In two or three days, at this rate. Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>"Very, but I don't mind. We had a good meal
yesterday."</p>

<p>"I'll try to get you some water to drink at the next
stop."</p>

<p>"Yes, if you can. And for yourself too."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm all right. Are you tired?"</p>

<p>"Just a bit."</p>

<p>"Then go to sleep now, if you like. At night it may be
chilly and you'll be kept awake."</p>

<p>She gave him a single quick glance that somehow
expressed the utter simplicity of their relationship. Their
lives had been knit together perfectly and completely; to
have shared hunger and thirst and tiredness, to have hidden
in dark thickets from enemies, to have washed in mountain
streams and slept under high trees&mdash;all had built up,
during those few hurried weeks, a tradition of love as
elemental as the earth on which they had lain together.</p>

<p>When she was asleep he stared at the slowly passing
landscape till he was drowsy himself. A little man next
to him, who had been sleeping, then awoke and produced
a small plug of chewing tobacco which he asked A.J. to
share. A.J. thanked him but declined, and this led to
conversation. There was something in the little man's soft
lilting voice that sounded vaguely familiar, and it soon
appeared that it was he who had shouted down to the bandits
in confirmation of A.J.'s own account of himself. As this
intervention had quite probably saved the situation, A.J.
felt grateful to him, though his appearance was far from
pleasant. He was dirty and very verminous, and had only one
eye; the other, he declared proudly, had been knocked out
by a woman. He did not explain when or how. He was full of
melancholy indignation over the cowardice of the others in
dealing with the bandits. "Nobody but me had the courage
to say a word to them," he kept repeating, and it was
undoubtedly true. "Just me&mdash;little Gregorovich with
the one eye&mdash;all the rest were afraid to speak." A
man some distance away shouted to him to stop talking, and
added, for A.J.'s benefit: "Don't listen to him, brother.
He's only a half-wit. The other half came out with his
eye." There was laughter at that, after which the little
man fell into partial silence for a while, muttering only
very quietly to himself. A.J. was inclined to believe the
diagnosis correct; the man's remaining eye held all the
hot, roving mania of the semi-insane.</p>

<p>Later the little man began to talk again. He seemed
to have something on his mind, to be nourishing some
vast and shadowy grievance against the world in general,
and from time to time he would scan the horizon eagerly
with his single eye. His talk was at first so idle and
disjointed that A.J. had much difficulty in comprehending
him; it was as if the man's brain, such as it might be,
were working only fitfully. But by degrees it all worked
itself out into something as understandable as it ever
would be. He had been a soldier, conscribed to fight the
Germans; he had fought them for two years without being
injured&mdash;the eye (once again his plaintiveness soared
momentarily into pride) was not a war-wound, but the work
of a woman. (And once again, also, he forbore to explain
when or how.) After the Revolution he had tried to get
back home, but he had lost his papers, and apparently
nothing could be done without papers. All he knew was
his own name&mdash;Gregorovich&mdash;and the name of his
village&mdash;Krokol; and these two names, it appeared,
hadn't been enough for the authorities. With rather wistful
indignation he described his visit to a government office
in Petrograd, whither he had drifted after the collapse of
the battle-fronts. "I should be glad," he had said, "if
you could tell me my full name and how I can get home.
I am little Gregorovich with the one eye, and I live at
Krokol."</p>

<p>"Krokol?" the clerk had said. (The little man imitated
the mincing, educated tones of the bureaucrat with savage
exaggeration.) "Krokol? Never heard of it? How do you spell
it?"</p>

<p>"I don't spell it," Gregorovich had replied.</p>

<p>"Don't spell it? And why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't spell anything. But I can describe it
to you&mdash;it is a village with a wide street and a tiny
steepled church."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," the clerk had then answered, "we can do
nothing for you. Good-day."</p>

<p>The little man's eye burned with renewed fever as he
recited this oft-told plaint. "Is it not scandalous," he
asked, "that in a free country no one can tell you who you
are or where you come from?"</p>

<p>That had taken place a year before, and since then
Gregorovich had been travelling vaguely about in search of
Krokol. He had just got on trains anywhere, hoping that
sometime he might reach a place where Krokol was known.
Occasionally he left the trains and walked, and always he
hoped that just over the horizon he would come across the
little steepled village.</p>

<p>A.J. was interested enough to question him minutely
about Krokol, but it was soon obvious why the clerk at
Petrograd had been so impatient. Gregorovich could give
nothing but the vaguest description that might have applied
to a thousand or ten thousand villages throughout the
length and breadth of the country. Even the name, without
a spelling, was a poor clue, since local people often
called their villages by names unidentifiable in maps or
gazetteers. Nor had Gregorovich a notion whether Krokol was
near or far from the sea, near or far from any big city,
near or far from any railway or river. All he could supply
was that repeated and useless mention of the wide street
and the steepled church.</p>

<p>A.J. questioned him further about his family, but again
his replies were valueless; he could only say that he
had a brother named Paul and a sister named Anna. Of any
family name he was completely ignorant, and was, indeed,
completely convinced that it was unnecessary. "Is it not
enough," he asked, "that I am little Gregorovich with the
one eye? Everyone in Krokol knows me."</p>

<p>He went on quietly protesting in this way until the
train came to a slow standstill in the midst of the burning
steppe. The halt was for no apparent reason save the whim
of the engine-driver and fireman, who climbed down from
their cab and lazed picturesquely on the shady side of
the train. The air, motionless as the train itself, soon
became hot and reeking inside the car, and those whose
heads chanced to be in sunlight twitched and fidgeted under
the glare. Movement, with its own particular discomforts,
had somehow kept at bay the greater tortures of hunger
and thirst; but now these two raged and stormed in a
world to themselves. Water&mdash;bread&mdash;the words
became symbols of all that a human being could live and
die for. A scuffle suddenly arose at one end of the car;
a man was drinking out of a bottle and his neighbour,
unable to endure the sight, attacked him with instant and
ungovernable fury. For a few seconds everyone was shouting
at once, till at last the assailant was overborne, and
was soon sobbing to himself, aware that he had behaved
shamefully. And the others, beyond their anger, seemed not
unwilling to be sorry for him. Then, with a sharp lurch,
the train began to move again and the resulting breath of
air took away the keener pangs for another interval.</p>

<p>Towards evening they reached a small station called
Minarsk, where they were shunted into a siding and given
water, but no food. The satisfaction of thirst, however,
put everyone in a good humour for a time; chatter became
quite animated, and noisy fraternisation went on between
the occupants of the car and the swarming refugees from the
station. A.J. was now beginning to know the circumstances
and personalities of many more of his fellow-travellers.
Besides the little man with one eye, there was a large
family of exiles returning from Irkutsk and hoping to reach
Kharkov; there were others seeking family or friends, some
whose villages had been destroyed in the fighting between
Reds and Whites, some who travelled in the despairing
belief that any place must be better than the one they had
left. One old pock-faced and long-limbed Tartar confessed
to a passionate love of travel for its own sake; his home
had been on the Kirghiz plains, but he had never, in those
old days, been able to afford the luxury of a third-class
ticket. Since the Revolution, however, it had become
increasingly easy to board trains without a ticket at all,
and his life had become correspondingly and increasingly
enjoyable. He had already (he told A.J.) been as far north
as Archangel, as far east as Tomsk, and as far south as
Merv. Now he was taking a westward trip; he hoped to visit
Kiev and make a pilgrimage to the monastery there. He was
quite happy. He chewed a little tobacco, but had had no
food for days and did not seem greatly to mind hunger,
thirst, or any other physical hardship.</p>

<p>The train remained in the siding until dawn, by
which time cheerfulness had sunk to zero again, for the
night air had been bitterly cold. To most had come the
realisation that summer was practically over, and that to
hunter and thirst would soon be added that more terrible
enemy&mdash;winter. The transition between the seasons was
always very short in that part of the country, so that
when, soon after dawn, the sun did not appear and the cold
wind still blew, it seemed as if winter had come in a
single night.</p>

<p>Then the train moved out and resumed its slow <i>jog-jog</i>
over the badly-laid track. Towards noon the weather, which
till then had been merely cold and cloudy, turned to rain,
which at first was greeted with joy, for it removed all
fears of a water-shortage. It was, plainly, the end of the
long drought, and such torrents were falling within an hour
that the thirsty had only to hold their tin cups through
the slats to have them, after a few moments, half-filled.
But the removal of thirst served only to accentuate hunger,
from which many, especially the women, were already
suffering torments.</p>

<p>A.J. had slept intermittently during the night and had
tried to shelter Daly with his great-coat; she, too, had
slept, but he was concerned by the way she had felt the
cold. Throughout the morning the weather worsened in every
way, and by late afternoon everyone (except the Tartar)
was in the lowest depth of misery and depression. The roof
of the car leaked water on the huddled occupants, and a
slanting wind cut in like knives. It was sad to remember
that twenty-four hours before men had been shielding their
faces from the sun; for now the sun seemed a last good
friend who had deserted them. No one could draw comfort
from the grey and empty desolation of those plains that
stretched mile beyond level mile until all was hazy in
rain-swept distance.</p>

<p>Again and again the train came to sudden jangling
stops, till at last the occupants were too tired and
dispirited to say anything, even to ask each other why;
they just lay where they were, crouching away from the
wind, and trying not to listen to the tattoo of rain
on the roof. But after one particularly long wait the
engine-driver and fireman carne walking together along
the track and to a few dismally enquiring faces announced
that the train could proceed no further; a heavy storm
just ahead had caused part of the line to subside. As
for how long it would take to repair the damage, they
could only shrug their shoulders and mutter '<i>Nichevo.</i>'
Where were they?&mdash;someone asked; and the same answer
came&mdash;'<i>Nichevo</i>'&mdash;neither the driver nor the
fireman had had any previous knowledge of that line. After
which, cursing the rain that was drenching their thin
clothes, they returned to the warmth and dryness of the
engine-cab.</p>

<p>For the passengers in the box-cars, however, such
consolations were not available. They were wet, cold,
miserable, ravenous with hunger, and stranded in an
unknown land. It was the little one-eyed man, who,
still dreaming of Krokol, gave them their first lift
of hope when, for a few seconds, the rain slackened.
During that interval he alone chanced to be searching
the horizon with his single eye and saw the towers
and roofs of a town in the far distance. It gave him
no thrill, for the place was decidedly not Krokol,
but the others, when he told them, were swept into a
flurry of anticipation. A town&mdash;perhaps a large
town&mdash;food&mdash;shelter&mdash;warmth&mdash;their
cravings soared dizzily as they began in frantic haste to
gather up their bundles and clamber out of the train. How
even a large town could instantly supply the wants of a
thousand starving and penniless refugees was a question
that did not, in that first intoxicating moment, occur to
them.</p>

<p>A.J. shared, though more soberly, the general
jubilation, but he had the more reason to, since money was
in his pocket and he could buy if there were anything at
all to be bought. Daly, tired and chilled, summoned all her
strength for the effort, and they climbed out of the train
with the others and began the dismal trek over the fields.
To those already weak and feverish, it was a perilous
journey. The rain continued to fall in heavy slanting
swathes, through which, from time to time, the distant town
showed like a mocking mirage; and the dry brown dust of the
steppes had been transformed to a jelly of squelching mud,
into which the feet sank ankle-deep with every pace. After
the first mile the procession had thinned out into a trail
of weary, mud-smeared stragglers, floundering along at
scarcely a mile an hour.</p>

<p>It was dark when A.J. and Daly reached the outskirts
of the town, and he had had to lift her practically every
step during that last half-mile. She was so obviously on
the verge of collapse that when he saw a large barn not far
away he made for it eagerly, anxious to reach any place
where she could rest out of the rain. There were already
several shelterers in the barn&mdash;women and children,
mostly, to whom weariness had grown to mean more than
hunger, cold, or any other feeling. He laid her gently on a
heap of sodden straw; the others were too tired to speak,
and so was she. "Wait here till I come back," he whispered,
and she gave him a faintly answering smile.</p>

<p>Then, bracing himself for the renewed buffeting of
rain and wind, he struggled on into the town. It seemed
fairly large, but he looked vainly for shop-signs or public
notices from which he might learn its name. The streets
were deserted in the downpour, but it was good, anyhow,
to leave the mud and reach the firm foothold of paved
roads. And he had roubles in his pocket&mdash;that, in the
circumstances, was the most cheering thing of all.</p>

<p>He walked so quickly that he arrived at the apparent
centre of the town well ahead of the others, many of
whom had committed the tactical error of knocking at the
first habitations they came to and begging for food. The
cottagers, fearing invasion by a seemingly vast rabble,
had replied by barricading their doors and refusing even
to parley. A.J. had guessed that this would happen, and
his own plan was based on it, though perhaps it was not
much of a plan in any event. He passed the church and the
town-hall, noticing that most of the shops were closed
and shuttered and that even those whose windows were
on view looked completely empty of foods. Soon he came
to a district of small houses such as might belong to
better-class artisans or factory-workers. He turned down
a deserted street, passing house after house that looked
as if it might be equally deserted, till at length he saw
one whose chimney showed a thin curl of ascending smoke.
He tapped quietly on the front door. After a pause it was
opened very cautiously by an elderly respectable-looking
woman, but his hopes fell heavily as he observed her. The
too vivid eyes and jutting cheek-bones told the tale he
had feared most, and her first words, in answer to his
question, confirmed it. The whole town, she told him quite
simply, was half-starving. Factories had closed down; men
scoured the countryside every day in quest of food which
became ever scarcer and dearer; food-shops opened only
twice a week, and there were long queues for even the
scanty allowance permitted by the new rationing system.</p>

<p>A.J. mentioned that he had a little money and was
prepared to pay generously for food and shelter for himself
and his wife, but the woman shook her head, "We <i>have</i> no
food," she said "no matter what you were to offer us for it
We haven't had a meal since the day before yesterday and as
soon as the rain stops my daughters and myself are going
to take turns in the bread-queue. The shop opens to-morrow
morning but to be in time for anything we shall have to
wait all night."</p>

<p>He thanked her and went on to another house a little
further along the street. There he was told a similar tale.
He entered another street. In all he tried nearly a dozen
houses before he found one whose occupants, very cautiously
and grudgingly, offered a little bread and a promise of
shelter in return for a quite fantastic sum of money. He
gave them something on account, took a piece of the bread,
and hastened back to the other side of the town. There
he found rioting already going on between the invading
refugees and the local inhabitants; several persons had
been seriously hurt. He reached the barn where women were
still sheltering, took Daly in his arms, helped her to her
feet, and almost carried her across the town. He dared not
offer her the bread until they were well away from the
others.</p>

<p>At last, at last, he had her safely under the roof of
the cottage, and its occupiers, with a promise of more
money, were lighting a fire.</p>

<p>They were curious people, and he could not at first
place them. There seemed to be a mother, two sons, and
two daughters, all living in four small rooms; their name
was Valimov. They had much better manners and cleaner
habits than were usual amongst working people; they were
secretive, too, about their personal affairs, though
inquisitive enough about A.J.'s. When later in the evening
news reached them of the rioting at the other end of the
town, Madame Valimova asked A.J. if he were one of the
refugees from the train. He said yes, he was. She replied
severely: "We should have had nothing to do with you if we
had known that. Why can't you wretched people stay in your
own towns, the same as we have to stay in ours?"</p>

<p>But soon a small wood fire was burning in the hearth
and a scanty meal of black bread and thin soup was being
prepared. The two travellers ate, drank, and dried
themselves as well as they could, but A.J. s pleasure at
such comparative good fortune was offset by anxiety about
Daly. She seemed to have taken a bad chili, and he promised
a further bribe to one of the daughters of the house in
return for the loan of dry clothes. The daughter, a clean
and neatly-dressed girl, helped him to prepare a bed near
the fire, and Daly, by that time feverishly tired, was
helped into it. She was soon asleep. He sat up for a time
by the fire, and towards midnight the girl entered the
room and brought him a small tumbler of vodka. The gift
was so unexpectedly welcome that he was profuse in his
thanks, and he was still more astonished when she went on:
"You see, sir, I think I know who you are. You are Count
Adraxine."</p>

<p>"What?" he cried, and was about to make an indignant
denial; then he checked himself and added more cautiously:
"Why, whatever makes you think that?"</p>

<p>"I remember the Countess, sir. I used to be a maid at
Baron Morvenstein's house in Moscow, and I remember her
quite distinctly."</p>

<p>He still stared in bewilderment, and she continued: "You
need not be afraid, sir&mdash;we are all very happy to be
of service to you and the Countess."</p>

<p>The revelation had been so sudden that, coming with the
vodka after all the hardships and adventures of the day,
it made him a little dizzy. Then, before his uncertain
eyes, a curious pageant was enacted. The rest of the
household, which till then had been rather unfriendly and
had bargained greedily for every rouble, came into the room
and were solemnly and separately presented to him by the
girl, whose name was Annetta. They all bowed or curtseyed,
and stared hard at the woman asleep in bed. Then they said
polite things, and he said (or thought he said&mdash;he was
too dazed to be sure of it) polite things in return. And
afterwards, which was more to the point, Annetta brought
him a second glass of vodka.</p>

<p>She told him that they had all been servants in big
houses until the Revolution; the men had been footmen
and the girls lady's-maids. Madame Valimova had been a
housekeeper. They had all saved money, so that the loss of
their jobs had not meant instant poverty; besides, their
masters and mistresses had been generous with farewell
gifts. But much more important than money, Annetta
confessed, was the fact that they had managed to hoard up
supplies of food.</p>

<p>After she had gone, A.J. sat for another hour in front
of the fire. The vodka had set the blood tingling in his
veins; his mind was still bewildered. He partly undressed
and lay down in the bed beside Daly; he went to sleep
and awoke to find himself somehow in her arms. She was
asleep then, and fever-hot; the fire in the hearth was
smouldering; rain was still falling outside. How fortunate
was their lot compared with that of the night before ...
Then she awoke and he told her all that had happened.
She was quietly astonished and confirmed the one fact
confirmable&mdash;that she had, on several occasions
before her marriage, visited Baron Morvenstein's house
in Moscow. He listened to her, yet all the time he was
thinking of something rather different; he was thinking how
strange, yet how natural, that they should both be lying
together, he and she, ex-commissar and ex-countess, there
in a workman's cottage in a town whose name they did not
yet know. (Which reminded him that he must ask Annetta in
the morning.) He said: "Of course, they take me for the
Count&mdash;which is funny, in a way."</p>

<p>She shivered with laughter. "Isn't it <i>all</i> funny? Isn't
everything rather a bad joke? Everything except&mdash;"
And she cast over him again the spell of her own dark and
sleepy passion.</p>

<p>In the morning they both rose late, the household
evidently preferring not to waken them. As soon, however,
as they were up and dressed, Annetta appeared with a pot
of steaming coffee, fresh rolls made of white flour, and
cherry jam. It was miraculous, and they guzzled over it
like children at a party.</p>

<p>Thus, for the time, they settled down with the Valimovs
in that once-prosperous town (whose name, by the way,
was Novarodar). Daly, as A.J. had suspected, had caught
a severe chill, and only very slowly recovered. But the
Valimovs did not appear to mind the delay; on the contrary,
they showed every sign of wishing it to continue. Nor,
now that they knew or thought they knew the identity
of their guests, would they accept a single rouble in
payment. A.J. was grateful, but he found it perplexingly
difficult to like them for it all. Their obsequiousness
got on his nerves, and he was a little disconcerted,
at times, by the utter ruthlessness of their attitude
towards their less fortunate neighbours. The cottage was
certainly a treasure-trove; it contained sacks of white
flour, dozens of tins of meat, fruit, and vegetables,
and large quantities of wines and spirits. Knowing what
servants were, A.J. was of the opinion that most of it had
been systematically thieved during the decade preceding
the Revolution. Anyhow, it was there; fortunately, in the
house of the Valimovs, stowed away carefully in wardrobes
and cupboards, while the rest of the town raked for potato
peelings in rubbish-heaps. A.J. had ample evidence of this,
for the took many walks about the streets. Sometimes,
fresh from an almost luxurious meal, he would pass the
bread-queue, stretching its unhappy length for nearly a
quarter of a mile along the main street. He saw women
who had been waiting for many hours faint and shriek
hysterically when they were told that nothing was left
for them. The Valimovs were careful never to give any
cause of suspicion to their neighbours; they took turns
in the bread-queues themselves, and they banged the door
relentlessly on every beggar&mdash;more relentlessly,
indeed, than they need have done. They seemed quite
confident that A.J. could be trusted with their secret;
they had his secret in return, and doubtless felt it to be
sufficient security. What puzzled him most was why they
should trouble to be so generous; he hardly thought it
could be because they hoped for future favours, for they
probably knew how slender were the chances of the old
aristocracy ever getting back their former possessions. He
knew, too, that it could not be from any altruistic notion
of helping a stranger, since before they had identified him
they had been eager to drive the hardest of bargains. In
the end he was forced to the conclusion that their motive
was one of simple snobbery&mdash;they were just delighted
to be in a position to help a Count and Countess. They had
lived so comfortably (and perhaps thieved so comfortably
too) in a world of superiors and inferiors that now, when
that world seemed completely capsized, they clung to
any floating shred of it with a fervour born of secret
panic.</p>

<p>Novarodar was Red, but not as Red as many other places;
its geographical position had kept it so far out of the
battle area, and also, owing to its small importance as a
railway centre, it had escaped Czecho-Slovak occupation.
The Valimovs, of course, dreamed secret dreams 'of the
day when they should see the Revolution overthrown, the
Imperial flag floating again over the town hall, and
strings of leading Reds lined up in the market square
before a firing squad. Perhaps, too, they envisaged a
certain bitter prestige appertaining to them when all
Novarodar should learn that they, the Valimovs, had given
shelter to two such illustrious persons as Count and
Countess Adraxine.</p>

<p>That day, remote as it seemed, looked infinitely more
so after an event which took place in mid-September.
That was the capture of Kazan by the Bolsheviks. The new
army, under Trotsky, drove out the Czechs after a two-day
fight, thereby changing the entire military and political
situation. With the Czechs in retreat down the Volga it
was no longer likely that the pincers would close and
the British troops from Archangel link up with the Czech
drive from the south. The news of the fall of Kazan caused
great commotion in Novarodar, for it was hoped that the
Bolshevist victory would mean the release of quantities
of food that had been hitherto held up. Its first effect,
however, was disappointingly contrary. Hundreds of White
refugees, many belonging to wealthy families, streamed
into the town from Kazan, where they had been living for
some time under Czech protection. The whole situation was
further complicated by exceptionally heavy rainfall, which
had flooded the surrounding country and made all the roads
to the south of the town impassable. Many White refugees,
caught between the floods and the Bolsheviks, preferred to
remain in the town and come to terms with its inhabitants,
whose redness did not preclude the acceptance of large
bribes for temporary shelter. Thus Novarodar actually
received more mouths for feeding instead of more food to
feed them, and the plight of those who had little money
became much worse than before.</p>

<p>To A.J., living through those strange days while Daly
slowly recuperated, it seemed impossible to state any sort
of case or draw any sort of moral from the chaos that was
everywhere. It was as if the threads of innumerable events
had got themselves tied up in knots that no historian
would ever unravel. The starved townspeople, the wealthy
refugees, the poverty-stricken refugees, the youths
of seventeen and eighteen in civilian clothes who had
obviously been Imperialist cadets, the streams of ragged,
famished, diseased, and homeless wanderers who passed into
the town as vaguely and with as little reason as they
passed out of it&mdash;all presented a nightmare pageant
of the inexplicable. Novarodar's small-town civilisation
had crumbled instantly beneath that combined onslaught
of flood, famine, and invasion; all the niceties of
metropolitan life&mdash;cafés, cinemas, electric light,
shop-windows&mdash;had disappeared in quick succession,
leaving the place more stark and dreary than the loneliest
village of the steppes.</p>

<p>Daly grew gradually stronger, though the strain of
recent weeks had been more considerable than either A.J.
or herself had supposed. A.J. was divided between two
desires&mdash;to give her ample time to rest and recover,
and to continue the journey. He did not like the way
events were developing in Novarodar, especially when,
towards the end of the month, came further news that the
Bolshevik army had taken Sembirsk. At last, to his great
relief, Daly seemed well enough again to face the risks of
travel&mdash;so much the more formidable now that the cold
weather had arrived. Their plans were of necessity altered
owing to the Czech retreat; indeed, it had been a bitter
disappointment to have to stay in Novarodar day after day
and know that every hour put extra miles between themselves
and safety. The nearest city now at which they could hope
to link up with the Whites was Samara, some two hundred
miles distant.</p>

<p>Meanwhile affairs at Novarodar very rapidly worsened.
As the inflowing stream of refugees continued, the last
skeleton organisation of the town collapsed; bread-riots
took the place of the bread-queues, and the main streets
were the scenes of frequent clashes between Red police and
bands of White fugitives. It looked, indeed, as if the
latter were planning a <i>coup d'état</i>; so many had entered
the town that they stood a good chance, if they were to
try. The inhabitants, starved and dispirited, were hardly
in a mood to care what happened, so long as, somehow or
other, they received supplies of food.</p>

<p>Then came news that the Bolsheviks were moving down the
Volga towards Samara. This sent a wave of panic amongst the
White refugees, for, unless they got away quickly eastward,
there was every possibility of their being trapped. Yet
eastward lay the floods, still rising, that had turned
vast areas into lakeland and swamps. Some took the risk of
drowning and starvation and set out, but for most there
began a period of anxious tension, with one eye on the
floodwater and the other on the maps which showed the rapid
Red advance. A shower of rain was enough to plunge the
town in almost tangible gloom, and groups of White cadets,
a little scared beyond their boyish laughter, climbed
the church tower at all times of the day and scanned
impatiently that horizon of inundated land. Even the local
inhabitants were beginning to be apprehensive. Their
position was a ticklish one, and the worried expression
on the faces of local Soviet officials was wholly
justified. Was it wise to have been so complacent with the
White refugees? The latter were too numerous now to be
intimidated, but at first, when they had begun to enter
the town, would it not have been better to have been more
severe? Troubled by these and similar misgivings, and with
their eyes fixed feverishly on the war-map, the Novarodar
Soviet, from being mildly pink, flushed to deep vermilion
in almost record time.</p>

<p>A.J. and Daly, like the rest, were waiting for the
floods to subside. They were both keen to get away, and
even the hospitality of the Valimovs, so unstintingly
given, would not induce them to stay an hour longer than
had to be. The Valimovs assured them that Novarodar was
quite safe whatever happened, but A.J. did not think so. At
last a day came when the floods showed signs of falling.
He had made all preparations for departure, had accepted
supplies of food from the still generous Valimovs, had
thanked them, and pressed them in vain to take some money
in return for all their gifts and services; and then, just
as he was tying up a final bundle, one of the young men
rushed in from the street with the news that Samara had
fallen.</p>

<p>All Novarodar was in instant uproar. With Samara in
Bolshevik hands the last hope that the Czech retirement was
only temporary disappeared. Worse still, the White line
of retreat was cut off; Novarodar was now ringed round on
three sides by Red troops, and the fourth and only line
of escape was waterlogged. White refugees were gathering
in little excited groups to discuss the matter; some set
out across the swamps, and later on that very day a few
stragglers carne back, mud-caked from head to foot, to
report catastrophes as horrible as any that were to be
feared.</p>

<p>Once again A.J.'s plans suffered a blow. There seemed
little hope now of ever catching up with the recreating
Czechs. A.J. and Daly talked the whole question over with
the Valimovs; the latter, of course, thought that the best
plan would be for them to stay, disguised as they were, in
Novarodar. But A.J. was still all for movement; he felt
instinctively that every moment in Novarodar was, as it
were, a challenge flung to Fate. He talked of making for
the Don country, where White troops, under Denikin, had
already driven a northward wedge to within a few score
miles of Voronezh. His eagerness increased as he computed
the chances of the plan. Denikin's army, he argued, was
more likely to advance than to retreat, since, unlike the
Czechs, it had a solid backing of support from the local
populations. And it was an advantage, too, that the way
towards Denikin was the way towards the Black Sea ports.
Had he and Daly succeeded in reaching the Czechs, their
sole line of escape would have been by the long and tedious
Trans-Siberian journey, during which anything might have
happened, and with the chance of being held up indefinitely
in the Far East. But to reach Denikin's army was to reach
at once a far simpler gateway to the outer world.</p>

<p>In the end it was agreed that the southward plan
should be tried; it was, in fact, the only practical
alternative to remaining in Novarodar. "We shall trust to
our disguise," A.J. said, "and work our way, by trains, if
we can find any, through Kuznetsk and Saratov." He agreed,
however, in view of the change of plans, to postpone
departure to the following morning.</p>

<p>The Valimovs were keenly interested in the adventure,
and, though discouraging at first, soon came to regard
it with tempered enthusiasm. In particular the mention
of Saratov roused them to a curious interchange of looks
amongst one another which A.J. did not fail to notice.
That evening, after the excellent dinner with which he
and Daly were always provided, Madame Valimova humbly
presented herself and craved an interview. He treated her
politely, as he always did, but with reserve. Daly was
more cordial, and this cordiality, natural as it was in
the circumstances, had often given him a feeling which he
could only diagnose as petulance. The fact was that Madame
Valimova, behind her obsequious manners, was an exceedingly
strong-willed person and had, he was sure, acquired a
considerable influence over Daly, whether the latter was
aware of it or not. He had no reason, of course, to believe
that this influence was for the bad, yet somehow, though he
could not explain it, he had misgivings.</p>

<p>Madame Valimova, with many apologies for troubling them,
soon came to the point. Before the Revolution, she said,
she and two of her sons had been servants in Petrograd at
the house of the Rosyankas. Prince and Princess Rosyanka
had been murdered by the Reds at Yaroslavl; there was a
large family, all of whom had been massacred with their
parents except the youngest&mdash;a girl of six. This
child, the sole survivor of the family and inheritor of the
title, had been hidden away by loyal servants and taken
south. It had been intended to smuggle the child abroad,
but, owing to increased Bolshevist vigilance, it had not
been possible to reach the Black Sea ports in time. The two
servants, a former butler named Stapen and his wife, who
had been a cook in the same household, were now living in
Saratov, and the child was still with them there.</p>

<p>Madame Valimova then produced a letter from this
ex-butler, written some weeks previously and delivered
by secret messenger. It conveyed the information that
the child was in fairly good health, and that Stapen
was constantly on the watch for some chance of sending
her south, especially now that Denikin was advancing so
rapidly. It was a risky business, however, and the person
to be trusted with such a task could not be selected in a
hurry. "You see," Madame Valimova explained, after A.J. and
Daly had both examined the letter, "the Bolshevists have
photographs of all the persons they are looking out for,
and the little princess is of course one of them. So many
escapes have been made lately that the examination is now
stricter than ever."</p>

<p>Briefly, Madame's suggestion was that he and Daly,
when they reached Saratov, should call at Stapen's house
and take the princess with them into safety. She was sure
they were the right sort of people to carry through such a
dangerous enterprise successfully. She gave them Stapen's
address and also a little amber bead which, she said,
would convince him of their <i>bona-fides</i>, even if he did
not recognise them. "But he probably will," she added.
"Butlers have a good memory for faces, and I'm sure you
must sometime or other have visited the Rosyankas."</p>

<p>Daly admitted that she had.</p>

<p>After Madame Valimova had gone, A.J. was inclined to
be doubtful. Madame's dominant personality, the delivery
of Stapen's letter by secret messenger, and various other
significant details, had all made him gradually aware that
Madame was a person of some importance in the sub-world of
counter-revolutionary plotting. He did not himself wish
to be drawn into White intrigue; his only aim was to get
himself and Daly out of the country, and he had no desire
to jeopardise their chances of success for the sake of a
small child whom they had neither of them ever seen. "If
the child is safe at Saratov," he argued, "why not let her
stay there?"</p>

<p>All that Daly would say was that there could be no
harm in promising the Valimovs to do what they could.
"Our plans," she said, "may have to be altered again, so
that we may never go anywhere near Saratov. We can only
give a conditional promise, but I think we might give
that&mdash;we really owe them a great deal, you know."</p>

<p>It was true, beyond question, and later that evening
A.J. assured Madame Valimova that he would certainly call
on Stapen if it were at all possible. Privately he meant
the reservation to mean a great deal.</p>

<p>Very early next morning he bade farewell to his hosts,
to whom he felt immensely grateful, even though he had not
been able to like them as much as he felt he ought. He
could not imagine how Daly and himself would have managed
without them; they had provided food and shelter just when
it had been most of all needed, and now they were prodigal
to the last, making up bundles of well-packed and artfully
disguised food supplies for them to take with them on their
journey. A.J. thanked them sincerely, yet was never more
relieved than when he turned the corner of the street.</p>

<p>Only a few moments afterwards a loud boom sounded
from the distance, together with a shattering explosion
somewhere over the centre of the town. The streets,
which till then had been nearly empty, filled suddenly
with scurrying inhabitants, all in panic to know what
had happened, while a few youths, White cadets, rushed
by in civilian clothes, hastily buckling on belts and
accoutrements as they ran. A.J. did not stop to make
enquiries, but he gathered from overheard question and
answer that the White refugees had organised a <i>coup
d'état</i> during the night, had killed the Soviet guard,
taken possession of all strategic points, and were now
preparing to defend the town against the approaching Red
army. The latter, however, had evidently learned of these
events, and were bombarding the town (so the rumour ran)
from an armoured train some miles away.</p>

<p>A.J.'s first idea was to get as far from the danger-zone
as possible, and with this intention he hurried Daly
through the rapidly thronging streets. At intervals
of a few minutes came the boom of the gun, but the
shells were bursting a safe distance away. Daly was not
nervous&mdash;only a little excited; and on himself, as
always, the sound of gun-fire exercised a rather clarifying
effect. He began to reckon the chances of getting well out
of the town before the real battle began. There was irony
in the fact that for weeks his aim had been to reach some
place that was held by the Whites, and that now, being in
such a place, his chief desire was to get out of it. It
would be the most frantic folly, he perceived, to trust
himself to this local and probably quite temporary White
success, for his judgment of affairs led him to doubt
whether the White occupation could last longer than a few
days at most.</p>

<p>Disappointment faced him when he reached the outskirts
of the town, where an iron bridge spanned the swollen
river. White guards were holding up the crowd of fugitives
who sought to cross, while other guards were hastily
digging trenches on the further bank. They were all in
an excitable, nerve-racked mood, aware of unwelcome
possibilities, and prepared to act desperately and
instantly. Not a single refugee, they ordered, must leave
the town; this was to prevent spies from reporting to the
Reds the preparations that were being made for the town's
defence. The ban applied to women and children as well as
to men, and was being enforced at every possible exit.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be gained by arguing the point,
apart from which, A.J. was anxious that both he and Daly
should remain as inconspicuous as possible. He felt that
their best chance of safety lay with the crowd of dirty,
ailing, poverty-stricken wretches who, merely because
nobody cared about them at all, were usually exempt from
too close attention by either side. Most of them were
squatting miserably in doorways along the road back to the
town, nibbling precious fragments of food, or rebandaging
their torn and blistered feet.</p>

<p>It was an anxious morning for Novarodar. Shells fell
every ten minutes or so on the centre of the town, but
many did not burst, and even the others were of poor
construction and caused little damage. Once one realised
that the likelihood of being hurt by the long-range
bombardment was considerably less than that of catching
typhus from the town's water-supply, it was possible to
ignore the intermittent booming and crashing. But such
philosophic detachment was not possible to everyone, and
towards midday there was evidence that many of the White
defenders were themselves losing nerve. Already rifle-fire
was being exchanged between the White trenches and advanced
Red scouting-parties. During the afternoon the leaders
of the local Soviet were dragged out of prison by White
guards, lined up in the market-square, and ceremonially
machine-gunned before a public for the most part too
apprehensive of its own immediate future to be either
repelled or elevated by such an entertainment.</p>

<p>During most of the morning A.J. and Daly sat patiently
in a side-street with a crowd of other refugees. But in
the afternoon, shortly after the shooting of the Soviet
leaders, White guards toured the town in motor cars and
rounded up all who were out of doors. Those who had
no homes were lodged in some of the big rooms of The
town-hall.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that the refugees had a sort of
grand-stand view of the entry of the Bolsheviks into
Novarodar, which took place about five o'clock in the
afternoon, after a sharp and bloodthirsty battle at the
town outskirts. At some points the Whites had resisted to
the last, but at others they had run away into the town and
sought refuge in houses.</p>

<p>Mysteriously and marvellously there appeared a dazzling
array of red flags to greet the invaders. The actual march
into the town was an almost suspiciously quiet affair. Not
a rifle-shot, nor a cheer, nor a lilt of a song disturbed
the march of those squads of hard-faced, bearded veterans
and grinning, wild-eyed boys, caked with mud and blood,
badly clothed, flushed with bitter triumph, helping their
wounded along or carrying them in improvised stretchers
made of great-coats. The Red leader, a keen-looking
youth of not more than twenty, halted his troops in the
market-square and read a proclamation declaring the
friendliest intentions of the invaders towards all who had
not given assistance to the Whites.</p>

<p>From the large windows, mostly broken, of that
first-floor room in the town-hall, history could be seen
enacting itself at a prodigious rate. The first task after
the reading of the proclamation was to deal with the
White prisoners actually captured in the trenches outside
the town. These men, battered and mud-stained as their
captors, were lined up and machine-gunned from a roof on
the opposite side of the square&mdash;not very copiously,
however, for there seemed to be a shortage of ammunition.
Their bodies, some still twitching, were then dragged away
and piled in a heap in a side-street.</p>

<p>The Reds were quite convinced that the shot prisoners
represented only a very small fraction of the Whites who
had held the town, and as night approached, the rage of
the invaders grew into a very positive determination to
root out all Whites who might be in hiding. Then began a
house-to-house search by groups of blood-maddened soldiery.
The market-square was the scene of some of the worst
incidents, for in it were the larger houses and shops in
which Whites might be expected to have found sympathisers.
Terrified wretches were dragged out of doorways and clubbed
to death; several were flung out of high windows and left
broken and dying on the pavements. Firing sounded from all
over the town, with now and then the sharp patter of a
machine-gun. Later on vengeance became more extended and
took in the entire bourgeois element among the townspeople;
shops were looted and better-class citizens seized in their
houses, accused vaguely of having assisted the Whites, and
butchered there and then on their own thresholds.</p>

<p>Some of the refugees screamed hysterically at the sights
that were to be seen from the town-hall windows, and many
covered their faces and refused to look. A few, however, of
whom A.J. was one, gazed on the scene almost impassively,
and this either because they were already satiated with
horrors, or because their minds had reached that calm
equilibrium, born of suffering, in which they saw that
market-square at Novarodar as but a tiny and, on the whole,
insignificant fragment of a world of steel and blood. To
A.J. the latter reason applied with especial force; and
more than ever, as the moments passed, his mind clung to
what was all in his life that counted&mdash;the woman
there at his side. The rest of the world was but a chaos
of cancelling wrongs, and to offer pity for it was as if
one should pour out a single drop of water upon a desert.
He felt, as he gazed down upon all the slaughter, that it
could not really matter, or it would not be happening.</p>

<p>He was pondering and feeling thus, when a man near
him, who had also been watching the scene quite calmly;
began to talk to him. He was a thin, ascetic-looking man,
middle-aged, with deep-set eyes and a lofty forehead. His
voice and accent were educated.</p>

<p>"If I may read your thoughts," he said quietly, "you
are wondering just how much and how little all this can
mean."</p>

<p>A.J. was unwilling to betray himself by any too
intelligent answer, so he merely half-nodded and let the
other continue talking, which he was more than willing
to do. He had been a professor of moral philosophy, he
confided, and was now penniless and starving. Probably
also (though he did not say so) he was a little mad. He
expounded to A.J. a copious theory of the decadence of
Western civilisation and the possible foundation of a new
and cruder era based on elementals such as hunger, thirst,
cruelty, and physical uncleanliness. "No man," he said
oracularly, "has really eaten until he has starved, or been
clean until he has felt the lice nibbling at him, or has
lived until he has faced death." He also praised civil war
as against war between nations, because it was necessarily
smaller and more personal. "It is better, my friend," he
said, "that I should kill you for your wife, or for the
contents of your pockets, than that we should stand in
opposing trenches and kill each other anonymously because
a few men in baroque armchairs a thousand miles away have
ordered us to."</p>

<p>Conversation was several times interrupted by gusts of
machine-gunning; once a spray of bullets shattered the
already broken windows and several refugees were cut by
falling glass.</p>

<p>About two in the morning there was a sudden commotion
in the building below, and a Red officer, armed with two
revolvers, rushed into the room with the brusque order that
all refugees were to form up in the square outside for
inspection, since it was believed that many White guards
and bourgeois sympathisers were hiding in disguise amongst
them.</p>

<p>The whole company, numbering between five and six
hundred, were marshalled in long lines facing the town-hall
front, where other groups of refugees were already drawn
up. The procedure had a certain ghastly simplicity. Red
officers, carrying lanterns, peered into the faces of each
person, searching for any evidences of refinement such as
might cast suspicion on the genuineness of identity. Hands
were also carefully inspected. When A.J. observed these
details he felt apprehensive, not on his own account, but
on Daly's. The examining officers, shouting furiously to
those who from weakness or panic could not stand upright,
were certainly not in a mood to give the benefit of any
doubts. Those whose faces were not seared deeply from winds
and rains, or whose hands were not coarse and calloused,
stood little chance of passing that ferocious scrutiny.
Slowly the group of suspects increased; the ex-professor
of philosophy was among the first to be sent to join
it. The officer who was examining those near A.J. was a
coolheaded, trim young fellow much less given to bullying
his victims than the rest, but also, A.J. could judge, much
less likely to be put off by a plausible tale. He did not
linger more than a few seconds over A.J.&mdash;that grim,
lined face and those hands hardened by Arctic winters were
their own best argument. At Daly, however, he paused with
rather keener interest. A.J. interposed with the story
he had prepared for the occasion&mdash;that she was his
daughter, a semi-invalid, and that he was taking her to
some distant friends by whom she might be better looked
after. The officer nodded but said: "Let her speak for
herself." Then he asked her for her name, age, and place of
birth&mdash;all of which had been agreed upon between A.J.
and herself for any such emergency. She answered in a quiet
voice and did not seem particularly nervous. That clearly
surprised the questioner, for he asked her next if she were
not afraid. She answered: "No, but&mdash;as my father has
just said&mdash;I am ill and would like to be allowed to
finish my journey as soon as possible."</p>

<p>While the youth was still questioning her, another
officer approached of a very different type. He was a
small, fat-faced, and rather elderly Jew, glittering with
epaulettes and gold teeth and thick-lensed spectacles. One
glance at the woman was apparently enough for him. "Don't
argue with her, Pushkov," he ordered sharply. "Put her
with the suspects&mdash;I'll deal with her myself in a few
moments."</p>

<p>Pushkov saluted and then bowed slightly to Daly. "You
will have to go over there for a further examination," he
said, and added, not unkindly, to A.J.&mdash;"Don't be
alarmed. You can go with her if you like."</p>

<p>They walked across the square, and on the way A.J.
whispered: "Don't be alarmed, as he said. We've come
through tighter corners than this one, I daresay." She
replied: "Yes, I know, and I'm not afraid."</p>

<p>The second examination, however, was brutally stringent.
The Reds were determined that no White sympathiser should
escape, and it was altogether a matter of indifference to
them whether, in making sure of that, they slaughtered
the innocent. The fat-faced Jew, who appeared to be the
inquisitor-in-chief, made this offensively clear. He took
the male suspects first, and after a sneering and hectoring
cross-examination, condemned them one after another. He
did not linger a moment over the professor of philosophy.
"You are a bourgeois&mdash;that is enough," he snapped,
and the man was hustled away towards a third group. When
this grew sufficiently large, the men in it were arranged
in line in a corner of the square and given over to the
soldiery, who, no doubt, took it for granted that all were
proved and convicted Whites. Then followed a scene which
was disturbing even to A.J.'s hardened nerves. The men were
simply clubbed and bayoneted to death. It was all over in
less than five minutes, but the cries and shrieks seemed to
echo for hours.</p>

<p>Many of the waiting women were by that time fainting
from fear and horror, but Daly was still calm. She
whispered: "I am thinking of what he said&mdash;that
one hasn't lived until one has faced death. Do you
remember?"</p>

<p>The Jew adopted different tactics with the women. He
wheedled; he was mock-courteous; doubtless he hoped that
his method would make them implicate one another. With
any who were even passably young and attractive he took
outrageous liberties, which most of the victims were too
terrified to resent, though a few, with ghastly eagerness,
sought in them a means of propitiation. When Daly's turn
came, he almost oozed politeness; he questioned her
minutely about her past life, her parents, education, and
so on. Then he signalled a soldier to fetch him something,
and after a moment the man returned with a large book
consisting of pages of pasted photographs and written
notes. The Jew took it and began to scrutinise each
photograph with elaborate care, comparing it with Daly.
This rather nerve-destroying ordeal lasted for some time,
for the photographs were numerous. At last he fixed on one,
gazed at it earnestly for some time, and then suddenly
barked out: "You have both been lying. You are not a
peasant woman. You are the ex-Countess Alexandra Adraxine,
related to the Romanovs who met their end at Yekaterinburg
last July. Don't bother to deny it&mdash;the photograph
makes absolute proof."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless we <i>do</i> deny it!" A.J. exclaimed, and Daly
echoed him. "It is absurd," she cried, with well-acted
emphasis. "We are two poor people on our way to visit our
friends, and you accuse me of being someone I have never
even heard of!"</p>

<p>The Jew laughed. "I accuse you of being the person you
are," he said, harshly. "Stand aside&mdash;we can't waste
all night over you."</p>

<p>The sensation of the discovery had by this time reached
the ears of the soldiers, and had also attracted the
attention of a small group of officers, among whom was
the youth who had conducted the earlier interrogation. He
hurriedly approached the Jew and whispered something in his
ear, and for several moments a muttered discussion went on
between them. Meanwhile the rank and file, fresh from their
slaughter of the first batch of suspects, were waiting
with increasing impatience for the next. "Let's have her!"
some of them were already shouting. The Jew seemed anxious
to conciliate them; he said, loudly so that they might
all hear him: "My dear Pushkov, it would not be proper to
treat this woman any differently from the rest. Women have
betrayed our cause no less than men&mdash;especially women
of high rank and position. The prisoner here may herself,
if the truth were known, be responsible for the lives
of hundreds of our soldiers. Are we to quail, like our
predecessors, before a mere title?"</p>

<p>Pushkov answered quietly: "Not at all, Bernstein&mdash;I
merely suggest that the woman should not be dealt with
before she is definitely proved guilty. After all, she
<i>may</i> be speaking the truth, and it would be too had if
she were to lose her life merely because of a slight
resemblance to one of those exceedingly bad photographs
that headquarters have sent us."</p>

<p>"Slight resemblance, eh? And bad photographs? My dear
Pushkov, look for yourself."</p>

<p>He handed the book to the other, who examined it and
then went on: "Well, there seems to me only a slight
resemblance such as might exist, say, between myself or
yourself and at least a dozen persons in this town if we
took the trouble to look for them. Frankly, it isn't the
sort of evidence on which I would care to condemn a dog,
much less a woman. And we have this fellow's statement,
also&mdash;he sounds honest."</p>

<p>"About as honest as she is, if you ask my opinion. We'll
attend to him afterwards."</p>

<p>"I merely suggest, Bernstein, that the matter should be
deferred for further investigation."</p>

<p>"But, my dear boy, where's the need of it? Surely we are
entitled to believe the evidence of our own eyes?"</p>

<p>"Photographs aren't our own eyes&mdash;that's just my
point. If this woman is really the Countess, it could not
be very difficult to have her identified by someone who
knew her formerly. There is bound to be somebody, either at
Sembirsk or Samar, who could do it."</p>

<p>"But not at Novarodar, eh? How convenient for her!" The
soldiers here began a renewed clamour for the prisoner
to be surrendered, and Bernstein, with a shrug of the
shoulders, exclaimed: "You see, Pushkov, what the men are
already thinking&mdash;they believe we are going to favour
this woman because of her high rank."</p>

<p>Pushkov replied, still very calmly: "I beg your pardon,
Bernstein&mdash;I thought the point was whether she is
guilty or not. If it is merely a matter of amusing the men,
doubtless she will do as well as anyone else."</p>

<p>Bernstein snorted angrily. "Really, Pushkov, you
forget yourself! The woman, to my mind, is already proved
guilty&mdash;guilty of having conspired against the
Revolution and against the lives of the Red army."</p>

<p>"Quite, if you are positive of her identity. That is my
point."</p>

<p>"Your point, eh? You change your point so often that one
has an infernal job to keep up with you! No, no, my dear
boy, it won't do&mdash;we've proved everything&mdash;the
Countess is guilty and this woman is the Countess. There is
no shadow of reason for any delay."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I do not agree."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you must disagree, that is all. The
responsibility, such as it is, rests with me."</p>

<p>"Take note, then, that I protest most strongly."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, my dear Pushkov, certainly."</p>

<p>"And in any case, since she is a woman, I suggest that
she should be treated mercifully."</p>

<p>"And not be handed over to our young rascals, you
mean, eh?" He laughed. "Well, perhaps you deserve some
small reward for your advocacy. Arrange the matter
as you want&mdash;you were always a lady's man. But
remember&mdash;the penalty is death&mdash;death to all
enemies of the Revolution. You may gild the pill as much as
you like, but the medicine has to be taken."</p>

<p>After this sententiousness Pushkov saluted and signed
to A.J. and Daly to accompany him. He led them into the
town-hall through a small entrance beneath the portico.
He did not speak till at length he opened the door of a
basement room in which a number of soldiers were smoking
and drinking tea. "Is Tamirsky here?" he asked, and an old
and grey-bearded soldier detached himself from the group.
Pushkov took him out into the corridor and whispered in his
ear for a few moments. Then, leading him to Daly, he began:
"Do you know this woman?"</p>

<p>Tamirsky gave her a profound stare from head to foot
and finally shook his head.</p>

<p>"You are prepared to swear that you have never seen her
before?"</p>

<p>"Yes, your honour."</p>

<p>"And you were&mdash;let me see&mdash;a gardener on the
estate of Count Adraxine before the Revolution?"</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"So that you often saw the Countess?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very often indeed, your honour."</p>

<p>"Thank you. You are sure of all this, and are ready to
swear to it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Then come with me now." To A.J. he added: "Wait there
with the soldiers till I return."</p>

<p>They waited, and in that atmosphere of stale
tobacco-smoke and heavy personal smells, Daly's strength
suddenly gave way. She collapsed and would have fallen had
not A.J. caught her quickly. The soldiers were sympathetic,
offering tea, as well as coats for her to rest on. A.J.
began to thank them, but one of them said: "Careful,
brother&mdash;don't tell us too much about yourselves."</p>

<p>After a quarter of an hour or so Pushkov and Tamirsky
returned together, and the former signalled to the two
prisoners to follow him again. Outside in the corridor
several Red guards, fully armed, were waiting. Pushkov
said: "Sentence is postponed. You are to be taken to Samara
for further identification. The train leaves in an hour;
these men will take you to the station." He gave an order
and went away quickly.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, thus escorted, they were hastening
through the dark streets. Scattered firing still echoed
over the town, but all was fairly quiet along the road
to the railway. Dawn was breaking as they passed through
the waiting-hall; the station was crowded with soldiers,
many asleep on the platforms against their packs. The
line, A.J. heard, had just been repaired after the recent
flood-damage. A train of <i>teplushki</i>[*], already full, lay
at one of the platforms, and on to it a first-class coach,
in reasonably good condition, was being shunted.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>teplushki</i>: box-cars.]</p>

<p>As soon as this operation was complete, A.J. and Daly
were put into one of the compartments, with two soldiers
mounting guard outside. The inevitable happened after
that; the two fugitive-prisoners, weary and limp after the
prolonged strain of the day and night, fell into almost
instant sleep. When they awoke it was broad daylight; snow
was falling outside; the train was moving slowly over an
expanse of level, dazzling white; and in the compartment,
quite alone with them, was Pushkov. He smiled slightly and
resumed the reading of a book.</p>

<p>A.J. smiled back, but did not speak. He felt a sort of
bewildered gratitude towards the young officer, but he was
not on that account disposed to be incautious. The youth's
steel-grey eyes, curiously attractive when he smiled,
seemed both a warning and an encouragement. If there were
to be conversation at all, Pushkov, A.J. decided, should
make the first move.</p>

<p>Several times during the next quarter of an hour Pushkov
looked at them as if expecting one or the other to speak,
and at last, tired of the silence, he put down his book and
asked if they were hungry.</p>

<p>They were, quite frantically, having eaten scarcely
anything for twenty-four hours, despite the fact that
their bundles, miraculously unconfiscated, were bulging
with food. A.J. said 'yes,' and smiled; whereupon Pushkov
offered them hard, gritty biscuits and thin slices
of rather sour cheese. They thanked him and ate with
relish.</p>

<p>"We are due to reach Samara late this evening," he said,
after a pause.</p>

<p>"A slow journey," A.J. commented.</p>

<p>"Yes, the line is shaky after the floods. When the train
stops somewhere I may be able to get you some tea."</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you."</p>

<p>"Not at all&mdash;we are condemned to be
fellow-travellers&mdash;is it not better to make things as
comfortable as we can for one another?"</p>

<p>So they began to talk, cautiously at first, but less
so after a while. There was something very likeable about
Pushkov; both A.J. and Daly fought against it, as for
their lives, but finally and utterly succumbed. Its secret
lay perhaps in contrast; the youth was at once strong and
gentle, winsome and severe, shy and self-assured, boyish
yet prematurely old. Like most officers in the new Red
army, he was scarcely out of his teens; yet his mind had a
clear, mature incisiveness that was apparent even in the
most ordinary exchange of polite conversation. After about
ten minutes of talk that carefully avoided anything of
consequence, he remarked reflectively: "The curse of this
country is that we are all born liars. We lie with such
simple profundity that there's nobody a man dare trust.
You, for instance, don't trust me&mdash;obviously not. And
I, just as naturally, don't trust you. Yet, once granting
the initial untrustworthiness of both of us, we shall
probably get on quite well together."</p>

<p>"We learn by experience how necessary it is to be
cautious," said A.J.</p>

<p>"Oh, precisely. Don't think I'm blaming you in the
least."</p>

<p>Then Daly, who had not so far spoken, interposed: "Still
less are we blaming you, Captain Pushkov. On the contrary,
we owe you far more than we can ever repay." A.J. nodded
emphatically.</p>

<p>"Not at all," Pushkov courteously replied. "Yet even
that, now you mention it, is a case in point&mdash;it could
not have happened without hard lying."</p>

<p>Daly smiled. "On our part, Captain?"</p>

<p>"Well, no&mdash;I was rather thinking of Tamirsky. He
lies so marvellously&mdash;it is a pure art with him. And
so faithfully, too&mdash;his lies are almost more steadfast
than the truth. You certainly owe your life to him,
Madame."</p>

<p>"And why not also to you, Captain, who told him what lie
to tell?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, no&mdash;you must not look at it in that way. My
own little lie was only a very poor and unsuccessful one
compared with Tamirsky's."</p>

<p>"What was your lie, Captain?"</p>

<p>He answered, rather slowly, and with his eyes,
implacable yet curiously tender, fixed upon her: "I said,
Madame, that in my opinion the photograph bore only a
slight resemblance to you. That was my lie. For the
photograph, in fact, was of you beyond all question."</p>

<p>She laughed. "Nevertheless, don't suppose for one moment
that I shall admit it."</p>

<p>"Of course not. Your best plan is so clearly a denial
that I don't find your denial either surprising or
convincing." He suddenly smiled, and as he did so the years
seemed to fall away and leave him just a boy. "But really,
don't let's worry ourselves. Quite frankly, I don't care in
the least who you are."</p>

<p>A.J. had been listening to the conversation with growing
astonishment and apprehension. There was such a charm about
Pushkov that he had been in constant dread of what Daly
might be lured into saying; yet an almost equal lure had
worked upon himself and had kept him from intervening.
Even now he was waiting for her answer with curiosity that
quite outdistanced fear. She said: "That leads up to a
rather remarkable conclusion, Captain. You believed I was
really the Countess, yet you made every effort to save my
life."</p>

<p>"Yes, perhaps I did, but I don't see anything very
remarkable in it."</p>

<p>They sat in silence for some time, while the
train-wheels jog jogged over the uneven track, across
a world that was but a white desert meeting a grey and
infinite horizon. A.J. was puzzled still, but less
apprehensive; it was queer how the fellow's charm
could melt away even deepest misgivings. More than
queer&mdash;there was something uncanny in it; and he
knew, too, that Daly was aware of the same uncanniness.
He glanced at her, and she smiled half-enquiringly,
half-reassuringly. Then she said, all at once serene:
"Captain, since you do not care who I am, there is no
reason why we should not all be the greatest of friends."
And turning to A.J. she added: "Don't you think we might
share our food with the Captain?"</p>

<p>A.J., after a moment's hesitation, returned her smile;
in another moment one of the bundles that had been so
neatly and carefully packed at the Valimovs' cottage was
being opened on that shabby but only slightly verminous
compartment-seat. There was a tin of pork and beans, a
tin of American mixed fruits, shortbread, chocolate,
and&mdash;rarest delicacy of all&mdash;a bottle of
old cognac. As these treasures were displayed one
after another, Pushkov showed all the excitement of a
well-mannered schoolboy. "But this is charming of you!"
he exclaimed rapturously, and then, with swift prudence,
rushed to lock the door leading to the corridor and
pull down the blinds. "It will be best for us not to be
observed," he laughed, and continued: "And to think that I
offered you my poor biscuits!"</p>

<p>"We were very grateful for them," Daly said, with a
shining sweetness in her eyes.</p>

<p>Then began a most incredible and extraordinary picnic.
Zest came over them all, as if they had been friends from
the beginning of the world, as if there were no future ever
to fear, as if all life held nothing but such friendship
and such joyous appetite. Pushkov's winsomeness overflowed
into sheer, radiant high spirits; Daly laughed and joked
with him like a carefree child; A.J. became the suddenly
suave and perfect host, handing round the food as gaily as
if they had all been on holiday together. It was like some
strange dream that they were all, as by a miracle, dreaming
at once. They shouted with laughter when Pushkov tried to
open the tin of fruit with the knife-blade and squirted
juice over his tunic. They had to eat everything with their
fingers and to drink the brandy out of the bottle&mdash;but
how wonderful it all was, and how real compared with that
unreal background of moving snow-fields and flicking
telegraph-poles! They did silly inconsequential things for
no reason but that they wanted to do them; Pushkov made a
fantastic impromptu after-dinner speech; A.J. followed it
by another; and Daly exclaimed, in the midst of everything:
"Captain, I'm sure you speak French&mdash;wouldn't you like
to?" And they all, in madness to be first, began gabbling
away like children.</p>

<p>The brandy passed round again, and Pushkov made
cigarettes out of the coarse army tobacco, and they puffed
away furiously as they chattered. It was brilliant chatter,
for the most part; Daly and Pushkov were perfect foils
for each other, and the queerest thing of all was that
they talked in an intricate, intimate way that somehow
needed neither questioning nor explaining on either side.
A.J., not talking quite so much, was nevertheless just as
happy&mdash;with a keenness, indeed, that was almost an
ache of memory, for he felt he had known Pushkov not only
before but many times before. Then Pushkov interrupted
one of his own fantastic speeches to thank them both with
instant tragic simplicity. "I suppose," he said, "we shall
not see one another again after we reach Samara. That is
a pity. The French say&mdash;<i>'Faire ses adieux, c'est
mourir un peu'</i>&mdash;but in this country it is <i>'mourir
entièrement.'</i> We have all of us died a thousand deaths
like that during these recent years." He seized Daly's
hand and pressed it to his lips with a strange blending
of gallantry and shyness. "Oh, how cruel the world is, to
have taken away my life far more than it can ever take away
yours..." Then he suddenly broke down into uncontrollable
sobbing. They were astounded and moved beyond speech;
Daly put her arm round the boy and drew his head gently
against her breast. He went on sobbing, and they could not
step him; his whole body shook as if the soul were being
wrenched out of it. Then, as quickly as it had begun,
it was all over, and he was looking up at her, his eyes
swimming in tears, and saying: "I humbly beg your pardon.
I don't know what you must think of me&mdash;behaving like
this It was the brandy&mdash;I'm unused to it."</p>

<p>They both smiled at him, trying to mean all they could
without speaking, and he took up his book and pretended to
read again. A.J., for something to do, cleared away the
remains of the meal and repacked the bundle, while lolly
stared out of the window at the dazzling snow. A long time
passed, and at length came the same cairn, controlled voice
that they had heard first of all in the market-place at
Novarodar. "Do you know Samara?" he was asking.</p>

<p>"I've been through it, that's all;" A.J. answered.</p>

<p>Pushkov continued: "It's a fairly large town&mdash;much
larger than Novarodar. As you know, our army has just taken
it from the Czechs. Its full of important people&mdash;all
kinds of people who were all kinds of things before the
Revolution. There are bound to be many who knew Countess
Adraxine personally."</p>

<p>Daly said still smiling: "And no Tamirskys, eh?"</p>

<p>"Probably not. The perfect Tamirsky is the rarest of all
creatures."</p>

<p>"I see So you are warning us?"</p>

<p>"Well, Hardly so much as that. But I am rather wondering
what is going to happen to you."</p>

<p>"Ah, we none of us know that, do we?"</p>

<p>"No, but I thought you alight possibly have something in
mind."</p>

<p>She looked at A.J. enquiringly and said: "I'm afraid we
just do what we can, as a rule, don't we?"</p>

<p>"You mean that you just take a chance if it comes
along?"</p>

<p>"What else is there we can do?"</p>

<p>"Do you think you will manage it in the end&mdash;what
you are trying to do?"</p>

<p>"With luck, perhaps."</p>

<p>"And you have had luck so far?"</p>

<p>She said: "Wonderful luck. And the most wonderful of all
was to meet you."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"I would think so even if to-morrow sees the end of us,
as it may do."</p>

<p>Every word of speech between them seemed to have
infinitely deeper and secondary meanings. He said, without
emotion: "You are the most astonishing woman I have ever
met. I altogether love you, as a matter of fact. I loved
you from the minute I saw you last night. Am. I being very
foolish or impertinent?"</p>

<p>"No, no, I'm sure you're not."</p>

<p>"You mean that?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"Ali, how perfect you are!" He stared at the pages of
the book for another short interval. Then he turned to
A.J. "I wonder if I might be permitted to have a little
more of that excellent cognac? It would be good for me, I
think&mdash;I feel a trifle faint."</p>

<p>A.J. unpacked the bottle for him, and Daly said,
warningly: "Remember now&mdash;you said you were unused to
it."</p>

<p>Pushkov answered, taking a strong gulp and laughing:
"I promise it won't have the same effect again." Then he
leaned back on the cushions and closed his eyes. The train
rattled on more slowly than ever; snow had stopped falling;
it was nearly dusk. Neither A.J. nor Daly disturbed the
strange silence through which the boy appeared to sleep.
Suddenly he opened his eyes, yawned vigorously, and strode
over to the window. "I think I can see a church in the
distance," he said, in perfectly normal tones. "That
must be Tarzov&mdash;we have to change to another train
there. Pick up your luggage and come out with me to the
refreshment buffet&mdash;I may be able to get you some
tea."</p>

<p>In a few moments the train ground down to an impotent
standstill at a small, crowded platform of a station. It
looked an odd place to have to change; there was no sign
of any rail junction, or of any other train, and Tarzov,
seen through the gathering dusk, had the air of a very
second-rate village indeed. There was the usual throng of
waiting refugees, with their usual attitude of having come
nowhence and being bound no-whither; and there was the
usual shouting and bell-jangling and scrambling for places.
Pushkov led them through the crowd to the refreshment
buffet, which, by no means to A.J.'s surprise, was found
to be closed. The boy, however, seemed not only surprised
but depressed and disappointed to a quite fantastic
degree&mdash;he had so wished, he said, to drink tea with
them once, before they separated. "You see," he said, "the
next station is Samara, only thirty versts away, and of
course the authorities there have been notified about you
by telephone, and there will be an escort waiting, and oh
well, it is all going to be very difficult and complicated.
Whereas here we can still be friends." He led them some
distance along the platform, away from the crowd, to a
point whence there was a view of the village&mdash;a poor
view, however, owing to the misty twilight.</p>

<p>He seemed anxious to talk to them about
something&mdash;perhaps about anything. "Tarzov," he said,
"is only a small place&mdash;it is on the Volga. If you
go down that street over there you come to the river in
about ten minutes. There is a little quay and there are
timber-barges usually, at this time of the year. They
take the rafts downstream during the daytime, and tie up
at the bank for the nights. Of course the passenger-boats
have been stopped since the civil war, but I believe the
timber-barges sometimes take a passenger or two, if people
have the money and make their own arrangements with the
bargemen. Some of the bargemen are Tartars&mdash;fine
old fellows from the Kirghiz country." He added, almost
apologetically: "This is really a most interesting part of
the world, though, of course, you don't see it at its best
at this time of the year."</p>

<p>Suddenly, as if remembering something, he exclaimed:
"Excuse me, I must go back to the train a moment&mdash;I
shan't be long." He dashed away into the midst of the
still scurrying crowd before they could answer, and in the
twilight they soon lost sight of him.</p>

<p>"He looked ill," Daly said.</p>

<p>A.J. answered: "He drank nearly all that brandy."</p>

<p>"Did he? Poor boy! Do you like him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"So do I&mdash;tremendously. And he's only a boy."</p>

<p>It was very cold, waiting there with the wind blowing
little gusts of snow into their faces.</p>

<p>A.J. said: "It's rather curious, having to change
trains at a place like this. There doesn't seem to be any
junction, and if it's only thirty versts to Samara, where
else can the train be going on to?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it isn't going on anywhere."</p>

<p>"Then why is everybody crowding to get into it?"</p>

<p>She clutched his arm with a sharp gesture. "Do you
realise&mdash;that we could <i>escape</i>&mdash;<i>now</i>? It's
almost dark&mdash;there's a mist&mdash;we should have a
chance."</p>

<p>He answered, his hand tightening over her wrist:
"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I believe you're right!" But he
did not move. "Yes, it's a chance&mdash;a chance!" Yet
still he did not move, and all at once there came the
splitting crack of a revolver-shot. It was not a sound to
attract particular attention at such a place and at such
a time&mdash;it would just, perhaps, make the average
hearer turn his head, if he were idle enough, and wonder
what it was. A.J. wondered, but his mind was grappling
with that more insistent matter&mdash;<i>escape</i>. Yes,
there would be a chance, and their only chance, for, as
Pushkov had told them, Samara was close, and Samara meant
armed escorts and prison-cells. Yes, yes,&mdash;there
was no time to lose&mdash;Pushkov would be back any
minute&mdash;they must think of themselves&mdash;they
must go <i>now</i>&mdash;<i>instantly</i>... But no&mdash;not for
a minute&mdash;a little man with a ridiculously tilted
fur cap was pacing up and down the platform; he would
pass them in a few seconds, would reach the end, turn,
pass them again, and then would come their chance... Yet
the man in the fur cap did not pass them. He stopped and
remarked, cheerfully: "Exciting business down there,
comrade," and jerked his head backward towards the
crowd. "Officer just shot himself. Through the head.
Deliberately&mdash;everybody saw him. Not a bad thing,
perhaps, if they all did it eh?" He laughed and passed
on. A.J. stared incredulously; it was Daly who led him
back to the crowd. "We must see," she said. "We must make
sure." When they reached the crown, soldiers were already
carrying a body into the waiting-room; it was she again
who pressed forward, edging her way in what doubtless
seemed mere ghoulish curiosity. When she rejoined A.J. it
was only to nod her head and take his arm. They walked
slowly away. Then she began to whisper excitedly: "Dear,
I'm just understanding it&mdash;that's what he <i>wanted</i>
us to do&mdash;all that talk about the road to the river,
and the bargemen who might take us if we offered them
money&mdash;Dear, we <i>must</i> do it&mdash;think how furious
he'd be if he thought we hadn't had the sense to take the
chance he gave us!"</p>

<p>"Yes. We'll do it."</p>

<p>They came to the end of the platform, but did not stop
and turn, like other up-and-down walkers. They hastened on
through the darkness, across the tracks and sidings, in
between rows of damaged box-cars, over a ditch into pale,
crunching snow-fields, and towards the river.</p>

<p>They skirted the village carefully, keeping well away
from the snow-covered roofs, yet not too far from them,
lest they should lose themselves in the mist. But A.J. had
sound directional instinct, and despite the mist and the
deep snow it was no more than a quarter of an hour before
they clambered over a fence and found themselves facing a
black vastness which, even before they heard the lapping of
the water, reassured them. They stopped for a few seconds
to listen; as well as the water, they could hear, very
faintly, the lilt of voices in the distance. They walked
some way along the path, their footsteps muffled in snow.
Then a tiny light came into view, reflected far over the
water till the mist engulfed it; the voices became plainer.
Suddenly A.J. whispered: "The timber-barges&mdash;here
they are!"&mdash;and they could sec the great rafts of
tree-trunks, snow-covered and lashed together, with the
winking light of the towing barge just ahead of them.
Voices were approaching as well as being approached;
soon two men passed by, speaking a language that was not
Russian, though it was clear from sound and gesture that
one of the men was bidding farewell to the other. They
both shouted out a cheerful 'Good-night' as they passed,
and a moment later A.J. heard them stop and give each
other resounding kisses on both cheeks. Then one of them
returned, overtaking the two fugitives near the gang-plank
that led down at a steep angle to the barge itself. They
could not see his face, but he was very big and tall. He
cried out a second cheerful 'Good-night,' and was about to
cross the plank, when A.J. asked: "Are you the captain of
this boat?"</p>

<p>The man seemed childishly pleased at being called
'captain,' and replied, in very bad Russian: "Yes, that's
right."</p>

<p>"We were wondering if you could take us along with
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I might, if you were to make it worth my
while."</p>

<p>To accept too instantly would have looked suspicious, so
A.J. went on: "We are only poor people, so we cannot afford
very much."</p>

<p>"Where do you want to go to?"</p>

<p>"A little village called Varokslav&mdash;it is on the
river, lower down."</p>

<p>"I don't think I know it at all."</p>

<p>A.J. was not surprised, for it was an invented name.</p>

<p>"It t is only very small&mdash;we would tell you when
you come to it."</p>

<p>"But how can we settle a price if I don't know how far
it is?"</p>

<p>To which A.J. answered: "Where is it you are bound for,
Captain?"</p>

<p>"Saratov. We are due there in three weeks."</p>

<p>"Very well, I will give you twenty gold roubles to take
us both to Saratov."</p>

<p>"Thirty, comrade."</p>

<p>They haggled in the usual way and finally came to terms
at twenty-four. Then the bargeman, whose Russian became
rapidly imperfect when he left the familiar ground of
bargaining, conveyed to them with great difficulty the fact
that accommodation on the barge was very poor, and that
there was only one cabin, which he himself, his wife, and
five children already occupied, and which the passengers
would have to share. A.J. said that would be all right,
and they did not mind. Then the bargeman confided to A.J.
that his name was Akhiz, and A.J. returned the compliment.
Having thus got over the introductions, Akhiz gave A.J. two
very loud kisses as a token of their future relationship
and invited both passengers to come on board immediately.
It was beginning to snow again, for which A.J. was
thankful, since their tracks would soon be covered. As they
crossed the steep plank there came, very faintly over the
white fields, the sound of a train puffing out of Tarzov
station.</p>

<p>Akhiz was a Tartar from Astrakhan&mdash;a young, genial,
magnificently strong and excessively dirty monster, six
feet five in height and correspondingly large in face and
mouth. His perfectly spaced teeth glittered like gems
whenever he smiled, which was fairly often. His wife,
small, fat, and of the same race, was less genial, but
almost more dirty, and their five children, ranging from a
baby to a six-year-old, were noisy, good-looking, and full
of ringworm.</p>

<p>The position of Akhiz in the scheme of things was
simple enough. He went up and down the Volga with his
timber-barge. He had been doing so for exactly twenty-six
years&mdash;since, in fact, the day he had been born on
just a similar barge on that same Volga. He was not a
man of acute intelligence; he could handle the rafts and
work the small steam-engine and strike a bargain and play
intricate games with dice, but that was almost all. Above
everything else, he was incurious&mdash;as incurious about
his two passengers as he was about the various excitements
and convolutions that had interfered with the timber trade
during recent years.</p>

<p>A.J. and Daly settled down effortlessly to the tranquil
barge life; they had been travelling so long and so far and
so cumbrously that the large, spacious existence in swollen
mid-stream seemed the most perfect and enchanting rest.
Even the stuffy cabin, swarming with children and fleas,
did not trouble them, though there was no privacy in it,
and Akhiz and his family conducted themselves at all times
with completely unembarrassed freedom.. They rather liked
Akhiz, however, and soon found it possible to behave before
him with no greater restraints than before some large and
good-humoured dog.</p>

<p>Every evening, at dusk, the barge drifted in to the
bank and was moored for the night. Akhiz was aware of
every current and backwater, and showed great skill in
manoeuvring the rafts into place. It was typical of him
that he knew practically nothing of the land beyond the
banks; he did not know even the names of most of the
villages that were passed. With an instinct for adapting
himself to circumstances without understanding them,
he managed somehow or other never to be short of food,
even though the country near by was famine-stricken;
fortunately, he and his family could eat almost
anything&mdash;queer-looking roots and seeds that A.J.
would have liked to know more about, if Akhiz had been
intelligent enough to be questioned. A.J. and Daly still
had ample food for themselves; at first they were afraid
of what Akhiz might deduce from their luxurious provender,
but they very soon realised that it was the way of Akhiz to
notice as little as possible and never to make any kind of
deduction at all. Once they went so far as to share with
him a tin of corned beef; he was hugely delighted, but
completely and almost disappointingly indifferent as to how
they had come to possess such a rarity.</p>

<p>It was so restful and satisfying to be on the barge
that during their first night aboard they hardly gave
thought to the dangers that might still be ahead. Dawn,
however, brought a more dispassionate outlook; it was
obvious then to both of them that their escape would soon
be discovered and that efforts would be made to recapture
them. A.J.'s immediate fear was of Samara, which they must
reach during the first day's journey; it seemed to him
that the authorities there were likely to be especially
vigilant and would probably suspect some method of escape
by river. During that first day, as the wooded bluffs
passed slowly by on either side, he debated in his mind
whether he should take Akhiz somewhat into his confidence.
Daly favoured doing so, and A.J. accordingly broached the
matter as delicately as he knew how. But delicacy was quite
wasted on Akhiz; he had to be told outright that his two
passengers were escaping from enemies who wanted to kill
them, and that anywhere, especially at Samara and the big
towns, he might be questioned by the authorities. They half
expected Akhiz to be furious and threaten to turn them
ashore, but instead he took it all in with a comprehension
so mild and casual that they could only wonder at first
if it were comprehension at all. "I don't think he really
understands what we've been getting at," A.J. said, but
there he certainly did Akhiz an injustice, for about an
hour later the huge fellow, beaming all over his face, drew
them to the far end of the barge and showed them a small
and inconspicuous gap which he had arranged amongst the
piled tree-trunks. "If anyone comes to ask for you, my wife
will say nobody here," he explained, in broken Russian.
"You will go in there&mdash;see?&mdash;and I will put the
logs back in their places&mdash;so. Plenty of room for you
in behind there." He grinned with immense geniality and
bared his arms to show them his bulging muscles. "Nobody
move those logs but me," he declared proudly, and it was
satisfactory to be able to believe it.</p>

<p>The presence of such an improvised hiding-place for
use in an emergency gave them a feeling of comfort and
security, and to A.J.'s further relief the barge did not
even put in at Samara, owing to high dock-charges, but went
on several miles below the town to a deserted and lonely
reach, where no stranger came on board and no suspicious
inspection seemed to be taking place from either bank.</p>

<p>They reached Syzran on the fifth day, passing under
the great steel railway bridge on which, but a few yards
above them, Red sentries were keeping guard, and reaching
the end of the long river-loop. The air turned colder, but
there was no further snowfall, and during the day-time
the sun shone with a fierceness that was quite cheerful,
even though it did not lift the temperature much above
freezing-point. Already round the edges of the backwaters
ice had begun to form. A.J. and Daly used sometimes to
choose a sheltered and sunny place among the tree-trunks
from which to watch the slowly-changing panorama; it was
bitterly cold in the open air, but for a time that was
preferable to the fetid atmosphere of the cabin. The river
was so wide that they were safe from observation, and
the country, especially on the left bank, so lonely that
often whole days passed without sound or sight of any
human existence on land. Compared with the chaos of which
their memories were full, the barge-life seemed a kind and
leisurely heaven. A.J.'s normally robust health benefited
a great deal from the rest and the cold, keen air; at dusk
and dawn he sometimes helped Akhiz with the rafts, and was
amused to give proof that his own personal strength was not
so very much inferior to that of the Tartar monster.</p>

<p>He would, indeed, have been very happy but for renewal
of his anxiety about Daly's health; the strain of the
journey seemed again to be weighing heavily on her. Yet she
was very cheerful and full of optimism. They began now to
talk as they had hardly dared to do before&mdash;of their
possible plans after reaching safety. Denikin's outposts,
A.J. believed, could not be much more distant than a few
days' journey from Saratov; it would probably be best to
leave the river there and cross that final danger-zone
on foot and by night. Then it seemed to occur to them
both simultaneously that they would be passing through
the town of Saratov, and that somewhere in it lived the
ex-butler and the little princess of whom the Valimovs had
so carefully informed them. Should they take the trouble
and incur all the possible extra risks that a visit might
involve? A.J. decided negatively, yet from that moment
they began to feel that the ex-butler and the child were
really living people, not merely abstractions talked about
by somebody else. They even began to imagine what the
girl might be like&mdash;dark or fair, pretty or plain,
well-bred or spoilt.</p>

<p>One cold sunny afternoon, as they sat together on the
timber with no sound about them save the swish of the water
and the occasional distant cry of a curlew, A.J. told her,
quite suddenly and on impulse, that he had been born in
England and had lived there during early youth. She was
naturally astonished, and still more so when he told her
the entire story of his early life and of the affairs that
had led to his loss of nationality and subsequent exile.
"But you are really English for all that?" she queried, and
he replied that he was not sure how the technical position
stood&mdash;there was little he could prove after so many
years. "Perhaps I am as I feel," he said, "and that is no
nationality at all."</p>

<p>It was curious how their life in the future, that was to
be so strange and different from any life they had known
together so far, seemed as much an end as a beginning.
They tried not to admit it, yet the feeling was there with
them both; it was so hard to think of a world that did not
consist entirely of the dangers of the next hour and mile,
of a life in which most things could be bought for money,
in which day after day would bring peaceful, prophesiable
happenings, and every night a bed and sleep. She said to
him once: "Dear, what shall we do? Shall we live in Paris?
Would you like to live in Paris?"</p>

<p>"I think I would like to live anywhere."</p>

<p>"Anywhere with me?"</p>

<p>"I meant that. I can't imagine life without you."</p>

<p>"Can you imagine life without all this worry and
adventure?"</p>

<p>"Hardly&mdash;yet. I don't know."</p>

<p>"How long will it take&mdash;the rest of the
journey&mdash;it we have luck?"</p>

<p>"We shall be in Saratov within a week or so. Allow
another week for reaching the Whites. I suppose then we
could get through to Rostov or Odessa, and there are boats
from those places to Constantinople, but we might have
to wait some time to get one. There would be passport
formalities and all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"And from Constantinople?"</p>

<p>"That again depends. Don't let's look too far ahead. At
present I've got my mind on Saratov."</p>

<p>"Saratov and our little princess."</p>

<p>"No." He smiled. "I don't propose to have anything to
do with her royal highness. And in any case she isn't
<i>ours</i>."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I shall always think of her as ours, even
if we never see her."</p>

<p>One evening in mid-November when the barge tied up near
a small village, A.J. heard a few men talking to Akhiz.
They were saying that the war in Europe was over and that
Germany had surrendered to the French and British, but the
information did not create the expected sensation. Akhiz
was unaware of a European war as distinct from any other
war; the world, seen from his timber-barge, seemed always
full of fighting, and he was entirely uninterested in
details.</p>

<p>They passed Volsk on the fourteenth day, but by that
time the clearing horizon of the future was dimmed again,
for Daly was ill. It was the cold, she confessed abjectly,
and bade A.J. not to worry about her; she would be all
right again when they reached a warmer climate. In former
times, she said, she had never been able to endure the
Russian winters; she had always gone either abroad or
to the Crimea. Besides, she had possessed furs in those
days&mdash;"and now," she added, half-laughing, "only Red
generals dare show them." She was still very cheerful,
and inclined to joke about her own weakness, but A.J. was
uneasy, because he knew that the cold was not excessive for
the country and the time of the year, and that there were
at least five hundred miles to be traversed before they
could expect warmer weather.</p>

<p>The trouble was that the only alternative to the open
air was the atmosphere of the cabin, which was always so
sickening that it was quite as much as they could do to
sleep in it during the nights.</p>

<p>They reached Saratov on the twentieth day, in the midst
of a heavy snowstorm. A.J. had been a little apprehensive
of the landing, which was just as well, for it enabled him
to spy out Red soldiers, suspiciously armed and eager,
waiting on the quay at which the barge was to berth. He
saw them out of the cabin window, and there was just
time to warn Akhiz and hurry Daly and himself to the
arranged refuge amongst the timber. Akhiz fulfilled his
part to perfection, pulling a huge log back to cover up
the entrance to the hiding-place. It was all accomplished
in good time and without mishap; again A.J.'s chief fear
was for Daly, who shivered in his arms with an unhappy
mingling of fear and cold. A.J. whispered to reassure her;
it was only a precaution, he said; the soldiers on the quay
might not be in search of them at all; and in any case,
there was no reason yet to be alarmed&mdash;they had come
successfully through many worse crises. But Daly would not
or could not be comforted; she whispered: "Oh, my darling,
I'm sorry&mdash;I'm sorry&mdash;I haven't any nerve left
at all&mdash;I can't help it&mdash;I'm just more terrified
than I've ever been!"</p>

<p>They felt the barge bumping against the quayside; they
heard sharp voices questioning Akhiz and the latter's slow,
good-tempered answers; then they heard footsteps scampering
on deck and over the piled timber. A.J. could not hear much
that was said, but from the whole manner of the proceeding
he guessed that a search was, after all, to be made.</p>

<p>About a quarter of an hour later voices came quite
near to them. One said: "Well, you know, this may be
all right as far as we've seen, but look at all this
timber&mdash;anyone could hide amongst it."</p>

<p>A.J.'s arm tightened round Daly, and from her sudden
stillness he thought she must be half-fainting.</p>

<p>Another voice said: "Yes, of course, that's true. And
this fellow's been putting in for nights at all kinds of
lonely places&mdash;nothing at all to stop anybody from
coming aboard while he's been asleep."</p>

<p>Akhiz said: "Timber very heavy to move."</p>

<p>"She had a man with her."</p>

<p>Akhiz repeated: "Timber very heavy."</p>

<p>"Yes, you fool, you've said it once."</p>

<p>Then from various sounds and movements it was apparent
that a few of the men were trying to move some of the
logs.</p>

<p>Later a voice said: "Well, how <i>do</i> you move the stuff
then?"</p>

<p>"Big crane comes along," said Akhiz.</p>

<p>"Well, keep a look-out when you unload, that's all. I
don't suppose anyone can be here, but still, as I say, keep
a look-out."</p>

<p>After which the voices and footsteps disappeared. That
was during the afternoon, and Akhiz did not release his
prisoners until dusk. By that time they were stiff with
cramp and chilled to the bone. "Very heavy, eh?" whispered
Akhiz, beaming at them, when he had pushed the log a foot
or so out of place. He seemed delighted at his own share in
the escapade, though still incurious as to what it was all
about. The quays were quite dark; the whole town, which in
daylight had looked so important and flourishing, was now
an overmastering stillness. Akhiz gave them scalding tea
in his cabin; A.J. then gave Akhiz the twenty-four roubles
agreed upon, plus another six for his extra services in
outwitting the searchers, plus a small tin of American
baked beans. Then they bade good-bye to their faithful
host and saviour, who kissed A.J. with tremendous fervour,
and even then, at that last moment, forbore to ask where
they were going or what they were intending to do. Finally
Akhiz went on deck to see if the quays were clear for them.
There were sentries patrolling around, on the look-out for
pilfering, but it was not very difficult to choose a safe
moment to cross the litter of railway tracks and reach
one of the steep alleys leading up from the docks to the
town.</p>

<p>When they carne to the less deserted streets they were
able to judge that Saratov was in a scarcely happier
condition than Novarodar. The shop-windows were empty; the
cafés closed and shuttered; no trams were running. It was
all depressing enough, except for the fact that it was,
after all, Saratov&mdash;the last important stage-point on
their long journey from danger into safety. The Whites were
but a few score miles away, which, after reckoning for so
long in terms of hundreds of miles, seemed next to nothing
at all; Denikin's army, too, might have been advancing and
have made the interval even less. As he trudged over the
crunching snow, A.J.'s spirits rose as he contemplated the
future.</p>

<p>But there was a more immediate future to be decided.
Refreshed and abundantly fit after the river-journey, he
would have pushed on that very night, and Daly also was
anxious to avoid delay. For a time they talked of reaching
some village perhaps ten miles or so out of Saratov and
seeking accommodation there. Villages were safer than
towns; the people in them were usually more kindly, less
terrified of the authorities, and less likely to be
inquisitive about passports and travel-permits.</p>

<p>But before they reached the suburban fringe of the town
this plan became suddenly impossible, for Daly was clearly
on the point of collapse. It was obvious that she could
not walk another mile, much less the unknown distance to
the nearest village, and there was nothing for it but to
contemplate the risks of seeking shelter in Saratov itself.
The town was noted for its strongly Red sympathies, and
A.J. did not feel happy at the prospect of spending a
night in it. He tried a few cottages, playing the part
of the wandering but not quite penniless working-man who
could pay a small sum for a bed for himself and his wife
until the morning; but in every case he was turned away.
One haggard housewife told him that nobody was allowed to
take in strangers, and that if he wanted accommodation he
had better apply to the Labour Bureau at the commissariat
offices of the local Soviet. When he reached Daly, whom he
had left a little distance away, he found her lying on the
snow-covered pavement. He picked her up; she was shivering
and trying to smile, but incapable of speech and only able
to stagger along with great difficulty. There remained
one last resource, which he had not wished to be driven
to&mdash;the address of the ex-butler. He mentioned it,
and she nodded agreement. Then he called at another house
and enquired the way; by good fortune it was in the same
quarter of the town, quite close.</p>

<p>A few moments later he was tapping at the door of a
small workman's-cottage. An elderly, white-haired man
appeared, to whom he said: "Does Stapen live here?" At that
the man's face took on an expression of sudden terror.
"Stapen?" he exclaimed, acting very badly. "No, there is
no one here of that name." Then A.J. realised the fears
that might be in the man's mind, and added: "I was sent
here by the Valimovs, of Novarodar." The old man stared
incredulously and, after a pause, asked them inside. He
had been almost dumb with fear, and now was in the same
condition with astonishment. A.J. talked a little to
reassure him, while Daly sank into a chair, too weak to
take any part in the conversation.</p>

<p>In the end their identities were satisfactorily
established, and the old man admitted that he was himself
Stapen, the ex-butler. He was also more than willing to
help them, though he had very little food and no money.
His wife was out at that moment, trying to get bread. Life
was terrible in Saratov, and he prayed that Denikin's army
might arrive soon.</p>

<p>Daly recovered a little in front of the fire, and Stapen
recognised her&mdash;or so he said&mdash;he had seen her in
the old days in Moscow. Daly also said (but perhaps from
mere politeness) that she thought she remembered him.</p>

<p>It was soon apparent that Stapen's mind was obsessed
with some other matter which he was afraid to mention until
Daly broached it first. She said: "Well, and have you the
little girl with you still?" Stapen's voice dropped then to
a throbbing whisper, he was evidently delighted that the
strangers knew all about it, yet at the same time awestruck
to be discussing it with them. He replied: "Yes, the
princess is upstairs. She has been ill&mdash;she has had
typhus&mdash;but she is now getting well. You would wish to
see her, eh? Or no&mdash;she may be asleep&mdash;perhaps
to-morrow will be better. You are going to take her with
you when you go?" He turned to A.J. and added: "Ah, I knew
the Valimovs would make a good choice&mdash;how I have been
longing for the day when I should hand her over to someone
such as yourself!"</p>

<p>His sincerity and devotion were beyond suspicion,
but A.J. at that moment was hardly in a mood to be
appreciative. He felt, indeed, a little impatient with the
fellow. Did nothing matter except the rescue of a princess?
He realised again how difficult and complicated would be
the escape to Denikin's lines if he and Daly were to be
burdened with a small and illustrious child.</p>

<p>"For the present," he answered, rather coldly, "we can
hardly look ahead as far as that. My wife is ill and needs
rest."</p>

<p>Stapen bowed, controlling his excitement like a
well-trained servant who allows it to be supposed that he
had momentarily forgotten himself. Within a short time he
had prepared a bed and Daly was being put into it. She
whispered, as A.J. laid her head on the pillow: "Dear, why
are you so angry with people like Stapen? You were angry
with the Valimovs too." He answered: "I'm not really angry
with them&mdash;I'm everlastingly grateful in most ways.
It's just that they seem to think other things matter more
than you."</p>

<p>"Well, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Possibly, but I can't be expected to agree to it."</p>

<p>"I don't think you care, then, for this little
princess?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. I hate her, even, because I see in her a
possible danger to you. It's all very selfish, I know,
but I can't help it. I won't even try to help it. The
world is so full of misery that one cant&mdash;one
daren't&mdash;one's eyes to it all. The most to be done is
to make sure of what one loves and never to let it go. All
the rest must be put outside&mdash;entirely."</p>

<p>"Do you think Pushkov felt like that?"</p>

<p>"Probably. He loved you too."</p>

<p>She smiled and closed her eyes, and he went down to talk
to Stapen. Her words, however, had made him rather more
friendly towards the old man, who proved, on acquaintance,
the pleasantest and simplest of types. His wife, who came
in later in the evening after failing to secure any bread,
was very different, but perhaps necessarily so in order
to strike a balance with a husband of such benignity. She
was a shrewd and rather embittered woman, who gave A.J.
hut the chilliest of welcomes. A fruitless four-hour wait
in a bread-queue had put her into a mood of outspokenness
that her husband sought in vain to check; she almost began
by saying: "Well, if Denikin's men are on the way, let
hem bring some food with them. For my part, I don't care
whether we are governed by Reds or Whites, so long as
working people can get enough to eat."</p>

<p>Afterwards Stapen apologised for her with stately
courtesy. "She was always like that," he said. "Many's
the time that my dear old master, Prince Borosil, said
to me&mdash;'Stapen, you should whip her!'&mdash;and I
promised I would. But, somehow, I could never bring myself
to do it."</p>

<p>In the morning Daly seemed much better, and A.J.'s hopes
began to be optimistic again. It was all, of course, a
little more difficult now that they had met Stapen. The
fellow assumed so completely that they intended to take the
child along with them when they made their dash for safety;
it was a dream he had been dreaming for months, and now it
seemed about to be accomplished he could only build pretty
details all around it. Would they take her to Paris? Or to
Rome? Or to London? There were royalties and semi-royalties
all over Europe who, it appeared, would be delighted to
extend unlimited hospitality to such an exalted babe.
For she was, Stapen explained in a whisper, within
measurable distance of being heir to all the Russias. The
Bolsheviks had killed so many of the ex-Emperor's family
and relatives&mdash;far more than anyone could estimate
exactly&mdash;and the careful, systematic process of
extermination was still being carried out. "That is why
they are always on the watch for the princess," he added,
"but so far I don't think they have the slightest idea
where she is. They have her photograph, of course, but
it is bound to be an old one, and she is different now,
especially after her illness."</p>

<p>A.J. and Daly were solemnly presented to the princess
that morning. She was a thin and sad little thing, wasted
by fever and obviously very weak. Stapen treated her with
rather absurd decorum, while his wife treated her exactly
as if she had been her own child; and the princess showed
unmistakable affection for them both.</p>

<p>But the more Stapen outlined the child's social and
dynastic importance the more unwilling A.J. was to encumber
himself with her. Yet it became increasingly difficult to
convey this to Stapen. It was not only that A.J. did not
wish to offend the fellow, but rather that no means existed
by which Stapen could be brought to conceive A.J.'s point
of view. "He won't see that we have our own future to
think of," A.J. told Daly. "Frankly, I'm not interested in
dynastic intrigues&mdash;it doesn't matter a jot to me that
the child's a princess, next in succession, and so on. All
I care about in the world is getting you to safety, and
I won't agree to anything that will lessen the chance of
it."</p>

<p>She smiled. "Very well, then, we shall have to tell
Stapen that we can't take her."</p>

<p>"Yes, and the sooner the better. I'll tell him in the
morning."</p>

<p>But in the morning Daly was ill again, after being sick
and feverish during the night. Their departure looked as if
it must be postponed for another day or two, and so, in the
circumstances, there did not seem any particular need to
present Stapen with the arranged ultimatum.</p>

<p>By noon the whole situation was changed utterly and
for the worse, for Daly was by this time very ill indeed,
and A.J., with fair experience of such matters, diagnosed
typhus. It was not really astonishing, and yet, for
some reason, it was a mischance that he had never even
considered.</p>

<p>There was no doctor to attend her; there had been none
for the little princess, either. There was no private
doctor, in fact, in the whole town. Typhus, spread by the
war and nourished by the famine, had overwhelmed Saratov to
an extent that A.J. had hardly realised during his few days
in the place. The hospitals were full, with patients lying
on stretchers between the beds; emergency hospitals were
also full, and more were being hastily built; yet still
the disease raged and spread, and the death-rate had been
steadily and appallingly on the increase for weeks. All the
hospitals were being managed by skeleton staffs of doctors
and nurses, and it had lately become so difficult to give
patients proper attention that many who stayed in their
homes with no professional doctoring at all had probably
an equal, if not a superior chance of recovery. Stapen
evidently thought so, and urged A.J. not to try to get
Daly into one of the hospitals. It would have been quite
impossible, in any case, for they were State institutions
and every patient entering had to pass through a sieve of
official enquiries. The same reason had prevented Stapen
from trying to find a hospital-bed for the princess, and
now, as he comfortingly explained to A.J., he was very
glad of it. "The countess will be far better here, just as
the princess was," he assured him, and A.J.'s heart warmed
towards the old man for showing such willingness to share
the burden of this extra misfortune, though in fact it was
Stapen's wife on whom the burden mostly fell.</p>

<p>A.J., fortunately, was at his best in an emergency of
such a kind. He had a fine instinct for doctoring, and had
acted as amateur doctor for so long and with such success
during a part of his life that he felt none of that vague
helplessness that afflicts the complete layman when faced
with medical problems. He had also a particular knowledge
of typhus itself; he had often diagnosed cases, and was
quite familiar with the normal course of the disease. Apart
from which, he possessed the proper temperament for living
through anxious moments; he was calm, quiet, soothing, and
never despondent. Stapen, he soon found, was no use at
all except as an amiable figurehead to surround the whole
affair with an atmosphere of benignity and goodwill; it
was his wife who did and was everything. This hard-faced,
dour, and rather truculent woman soon drew from A.J. the
deepest admiration; he perceived that it was she, and she
alone, who had saved the child's life. And she tackled
this additional job of nursing Daly with an apparent
grudgingness which concealed, net so much a warm heart, as
a thoroughly efficient soul. J, could well imagine the sort
of cook she had been, and be cold also well imagine the
sort of butler Stapen had been.</p>

<p>So Saratov, which was to have been but a stage on a
final dash to freedom, became instead a last prison closing
them round. To A.J., sitting at the bedside, nothing
remained but love. He realised, now as never before, how
dear she was, and how utterly beyond beauty to him. His
mind glowed and throbbed with a hundred memories of her;
he saw her dark eyes opening at dawn, and heard her deep
tranquil laughter echoing amongst the boles of great trees;
he felt again the slumberous passion that had seemed
to wrap them both in unity with every little rustling
leaf. From his first notice of her in the prison-cell at
Khalinsk, everything had had the terrible, lovely reality
of a child's fairy-tale.</p>

<p>A good deal of the time she was in delirium and talked
ramblingly, but sometimes her mind cleared for a few
moments and she would beg him to look after himself and try
not to take the disease from her. She often said: "Oh, I'm
so sorry just at the end of our journey&mdash;I do feel I
ought to be ashamed..."</p>

<p>He comforted her by relating how Denikin's army was
advancing, thus lessening the distance between themselves
and safety even while she lay in bed.</p>

<p>Often, in her delirium, she called his name, appealing
to him to protect her from shadowy terrors, but sometimes
even her delirium was calm and she would talk serenely
about all kinds of things. She constantly mentioned the
girl, calling her 'our little princess' in the way they had
joked about her during the barge journey.</p>

<p>About a week after the onset of the fever she appeared
to become very much better, and A.J. began to hope that
the crisis was passing. She talked to him that day quite
lucidly about their plans for escape; the Whites, he told
her, were now only forty or fifty miles to the south, so
that they might count themselves fortunate, even in the
delay. Then she asked suddenly: "Where can we be married,
do you think?"</p>

<p>He answered: "In Odessa, perhaps or Constantinople, at
any rate."</p>

<p>She smiled, and seemed very happy in contemplation of
it. After a pause she went on to ask if he had yet told
Stapen that he did not intend to take the child with
them.</p>

<p>He answered that he hadn't, but that he would do so
whenever the matter became urgent.</p>

<p>She said: "I suppose we can't possibly take her with
us?"</p>

<p>"Do you want to?" he asked; and she replied: "I would
like to, if we could, but of course it's for you to decide.
It's you who'd have all the bother of both of us, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"It isn't bother I'd mind. It's danger&mdash;to you."</p>

<p>"Do you think there would he much danger?"</p>

<p>"More than I'd care to risk."</p>

<p>"I know. I agree. We won't have her."</p>

<p>"I wish we could, for your sake."</p>

<p>"Oh no, it doesn't matter. I don't quite know why I'm
worrying you so much about it."</p>

<p>"You're really keen on having her, then, if we
could?"</p>

<p>She answered then, almost sobbing: "Terribly,
darling&mdash;<i>terribly</i>. And I don't know why."</p>

<p>A few hours later the sudden improvement in her
condition disappeared with equal suddenness, and the fever,
after its respite, seemed to attack her with renewed venom.
To A.J. the change was the bitterest of blows, and all the
old iron rage stalked through his veins again. He could not
look at the rapidly recovering child downstairs without
a clench of dislike; but for her, he worked it out, they
would never have called at Stapen's house, and Daly would
never have been ill. (Yet that, he knew in his heart, was
far from certain; the whole district was typhus-ridden, and
it was impossible to establish how and from whom contagion
had been passed.)</p>

<p>On the tenth day he knew that the crisis was
approaching; if she survived it, she would almost certainly
recover. He was at her bedside hour after hour, helping
in ail the details of nursing; Stapen's wife and himself,
though they rarely exchanged more than sharp question
and answer, were grimly together in the struggle. And
it was not only a struggle against disease, for every
day the search for the barest essentials of food was a
battle in itself. Only rarely could milk be obtained,
while nourishing soups and other invalid delicacies were
quite beyond possibility. The last of the food that he
had brought with him from Novarodar had long since been
consumed, so that now he too was relying on the acquisitive
efforts of Stapen's wife. Sometimes she went out early in
the morning, with the temperature far below freezing-point,
and came back at dusk, after tramping many miles&mdash;with
nothing. A.J. never offered her copious sympathy, as
Stapen did, yet there was between them always a secret
comprehension of the agonies of the day. When he looked up
from Daly's flushed and twitching face it was often to sec
Stapen's wife gazing from the other side of the bed with
queer, companionable grimness.</p>

<p>Once while Daly was sleeping they held a curious
whispered conversation across the bed. She asked him how he
intended to proceed when Daly was better, and then, after
he had explained to her his plans, she said: "You'll find
the child a nuisance&mdash;perhaps a danger, too. There's a
very strict watch on all the frontiers."</p>

<p>"I know that."</p>

<p>"I wonder you bother to take her with you at all."</p>

<p>"Oh?" He was surprised, and waited for her to
continue. She said, after a pause: "Look after your own
affairs&mdash;that would be my advice, if you asked for
it."</p>

<p>"And the child?"</p>

<p>"She can stay here."</p>

<p>"For how long?"</p>

<p>"For always, if necessary. I don't see that it matters
whether she's here or in a king's palace, so long as she's
happy. And the way the world is just now, princesses
haven't much chance of happiness."</p>

<p>"What would your husband say to that, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>him?</i>"</p>

<p>She uttered the monosyllable with such overwhelming
emphasis that it was not even contemptuous.</p>

<p>Neither of them pursued the argument farther. Yet it
was strange how the problem of the child was growing
in importance; hardly an hour passed now without some
delirious mention of it by Daly. It seemed to be on her
mind to the exclusion of all other problems. On the twelfth
day she suddenly became clear-headed and told A.J. that she
was going to get better. Then, with her next breath, she
said: "But if I don't, you <i>will</i> take the girl with you
alone, won't you?"</p>

<p>That word 'alone'&mdash;his first glimpse into another
world&mdash;sank on his heart till he could scarcely reason
out an answer of any kind.</p>

<p>She went on: "will you promise that&mdash;to take her
with you alone&mdash;if&mdash;if I don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But You are&mdash;oh, you <i>are</i> going to get
better!"</p>

<p>"Darling, yes, of course I am. But still, I want your
promise."</p>

<p>He could do nothing but assent. But a moment later
he said: "She would be all right, you know, left
here&mdash;the Stapens would give her a good home."</p>

<p>"But she's ours&mdash;the only thing we can call ours,
anyway. I'm pretending she belongs to us&mdash;I want
somebody to belong to us. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>He nodded desperately.</p>

<p>"And so you <i>do</i> promise, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. You can trust me."</p>

<p>She seemed to be suddenly calmed. In a few moments she
went to sleep, and slept so peacefully that A.J.'s hopes
surged again as he watched her. Then about midnight she
woke up and touched his hand. "Dear," she whispered, "I
am quite happy. It has all been wonderful, hasn't it?" He
laid his cheek against her arm, and when he looked up she
had closed her eyes. She never opened them to consciousness
again. She died at a few minutes to one on that morning of
the fourth of December nineteen hundred and eighteen.</p>

<p>A.J. took the child with him and set out from Saratov.
There was a look of nothingness in his eyes and the sound
of nothingness in his voice. Bitter weather had put a
stop to Denikin's advance, and the fugitives who passed
him by along the roads were freezing as well as starving.
He neither feared nor hoped; he pushed on, mile after
mile over the snowbound, famine-stricken country; he was
an automaton merely, and when he reached the Bolshevik
lines the same automatism functioned to plan the necessary
details of the final adventure. But it was no adventure,
after all; he crossed over without a thrill, and was soon
heading for the coast through a country harried by White
Cossacks as well as by universal foes that knew and cared
for no frontiers.</p>

<p>Soon, in some city full of White generals, his course
of action should have been fairly simple. An interview
at headquarters, the production of certain papers of
identification with which Stapen had provided him, and the
child would doubtless be taken off his hands and placed in
the exalted groove to which her birth and the circumstances
of the times entitled her. He had no relish for the task
of surrender and explanation, nor yet was he reluctant to
perform it; he cared simply nothing for the child, and as
little for any praises that might be awaiting him as her
deliverer.</p>

<p>The long journey from Saratov had been full of
hardships, and the child, barely recovered from her earlier
illness, was soon ailing again. Suddenly one morning,
waking up in a small-town inn where they had both slept
huddled together on the floor, A.J. knew that he was ill
himself. He had scarcely strength to move, and fell in
the roadway outside when he tried to resume the journey
southward.</p>

<p>There was an American Relief detachment stationed in the
town&mdash;a tiny fragment of the teeming wealth of the Far
West, transferred bodily, as if by some miracle, to become
an object of amazement on the stricken plains of Russia.
The detachment had built itself hutments on the outskirts
of the town; there were large hospital-wards, cleansing
stations, and distributing depots for food and clothing.
Outside the huts all was age-old and primeval; inside
them, the white-coated surgeons and their enthusiastic
helpers bustled about in a constant whirr of hygiene and
efficiency. When A.J. and the child were carried into the
examination room, particulars concerning them were neatly
taken down by a Harvard graduate and filed away in an
immense card-indexing cabinet. A.J. gave his assumed name,
and when he was asked for an address he shook his head. He
was then asked other questions&mdash;his age, profession,
and where he had come from&mdash;but he was too ill to
answer in detail, even if he had wished to. When, however,
a separate card was filled in for the child and the latter
was assumed to be his, he made an effort to explain
something, but the Harvard graduate, knowing Russian
imperfectly, did not fully comprehend, and A.J., seeing a
whole world swimming round about him in vast circles of
incredibility, was barely coherent. At last the Harvard
man said: "You mean that the girl is not your child?" A.J.
nodded. "Who is she then?" But he could only shake his
head in reply, and they asked him no further questions. An
hour later, when he was being undressed, the papers in his
pocket were discovered, examined, found incomprehensible,
and placed efficiently in the fumigating oven alongside
his clothes and bundle of possessions. After a complete
cleansing the whole lot were then made into a paper parcel,
neatly ticketed, and put aside. The parcel was handed to
him a month later when he left hospital after as near a
death from typhus as two cheerful nurses from Ohio had ever
watched for.</p>

<p>During delirium he had suddenly astonished these
nurses by murmuring a few phrases in English, and this,
on being reported to the higher authorities, had caused
some little sensation. The Harvard graduate went even so
far as to take a card from the filing-cabinet, inscribe
in the 'profession' column the words 'speaks a little
English&mdash;perhaps a waiter,' and then replace the
card in the filing-cabinet. When, after his delirium, the
patient recovered consciousness, the nurses naturally
addressed him in English; he would not answer at first,
but on being told of his ravings, admitted that he knew
the language. He would not, however, tell them anything
more about himself, and firmly declined to converse. He
soon gained a mysterious reputation, and several doctors,
including one very eminent psycho-analyst from Boston, paid
him special visits. The psycho-analyst said that he must
have been blown up in the war, and specified the exact
sections of his brain that had suffered most damage.</p>

<p>Once during Isis illness he had enquired about the
child, but his questions could not be answered, being
outside the province of the hospital staff. They assured
him, however, that all children received by the relief
detachments were splendidly looked after and that he had
nothing at all to worry about. He was not worrying, as it
happened. When he left the hospital he called at the relief
headquarters to make further enquiry; the Harvard graduate
turned up his card in the filing-cabinet, turned up the
girl's card, and declared, with business-like promptness,
that she had been sent away. Then, seeing his own note on
the man's card, he added: "Ah, you're the chap who speaks
a little English, aren't you? You won't mind if I drop the
Russian, then, eh?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind," A.J. said.</p>

<p>So they talked, or rather the Harvard graduate talked,
in English. He explained that all orphaned children were
being transferred to a big children's camp in the Crimea,
run by the Americans in connection with several American
charitable organisations. There the children were being
housed, fed, clothed, and looked after at American expense,
and an attempt was even being made to get certain families
in America to adopt individual children. "So far the
response has been very gratifying," declared the young
man, toying with his horn-rimmed spectacles. "Of course it
depends on our State Department how many are allowed to go,
but I believe permission has already been given for the
first batch."</p>

<p>A.J. nodded.</p>

<p>"It would be possible, no doubt," continued the young
man agreeably, "to trace any particular child."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see. But that would take time."</p>

<p>"You are in a hurry?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not really&mdash;but I must get away."</p>

<p>"Where to?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>The Harvard man stared at the desk, thinking how
typically Russian the reply was&mdash;so like a piece out
of a Chekhov play&mdash;in fact, to be candid, more than a
little imbecile. Contenting himself with a final rally of
his official self, he rejoined: "I trust there has been no
mistake of any kind. We have it noted here that you came
with the child, that you denied that you were the child's
father, and that you indicated that the child was without
parents. That being so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, quite," answered A.J., taking up his paper
parcel. "It doesn't matter, I assure you."</p>

<p>And, after all, it didn't matter. Nothing mattered. He
was just passing out of the office after a perfunctory
good-day, when the other called him back. "Just a moment. I
don't know whether&mdash;you see, you said you didn't know
where you were going to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps in that case you'd consider staying on
here for a little while?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, you'd be pretty useful as an interpreter. The pay
would be a dollar a day, and you could feed and sleep here,
of course."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I'll stay."</p>

<p>Such an instant acceptance seemed rather to disconcert
the young man, but he managed to express his pleasure,
and soon afterwards set A.J. to work on a pile of letters
waiting to be deciphered from the Russian.</p>

<p>Thus A.J. became part of the American Relief
detachment at Pavlokov. His jobs, besides the translating
and answering of letters, included the receiving and
questioning of applicants for assistance, and he was also
called for by anybody and everybody in all linguistic
emergencies of every kind. He worked hard and was rather
a success. Yet at the end of six months nobody knew him
any better than at the beginning. The Harvard graduate, as
well as many of the doctors and nurses, made innumerable
efforts to break down the harrier and become intimate;
hut, though always polite, A.J. never yielded an inch.
They all concluded that he must be slightly mad, yet they
all trusted him to a degree oddly inharmonious with such a
conclusion.</p>

<p>One day in April the Harvard man approached him with
an item of news that he evidently felt sure would lead to
confidences. "Oh, I put through an enquiry," he began,
trying to appear very official, "about that young girl you
were interested in. It seems she was in the first batch
sent over to America. She must be there by now. Very lucky
for her&mdash;I don't think they're intending to send any
more."</p>

<p>A.J. made no comment, and the other went on: "Yes,
that's right&mdash;she must have crossed on the <i>Bactria</i>
some weeks ago. She hadn't any name that our people knew
of, so she was given one&mdash;'Mary Denver'&mdash;Denver
being the city she was to be sent to on arrival the other
side. Of course that's only provisional&mdash;doubtless
she'll eventually take the name of the family that adopts
her. I could find out who they are, I daresay though
strictly speaking it would be against the rules."</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't matter," was all that A.J. said.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1919 the American Relief detachment was
ordered home. A.J. had by that time saved up two hundred
and fifty American dollars. When the time approached for
the break-up of the organisation, he was rather surprised
to find that he disliked the prospect of wandering vaguely
about the earth again, even with American money in his
pocket; he had grown so used to the clean, orderly rhythm
of events with the Americans, to the daily baths, and the
breakfast cereals, and the card-indexing system. Decadence,
perhaps, but excusable. He felt too tired to break out of
the comfortable groove, too uninterested ever again to find
his own way about the world; he wanted just to be told
quietly to do certain things, and to be given regular meals
and a bed in return for doing them.</p>

<p>He applied for permission to go to America with the
others, but though the heads of the medical staff strongly
supported his application, it was turned down because of
his supposedly Russian nationality. Then he told them,
suddenly communicative after all those months of reticence,
that he was not Russian but English by birth and parentage,
and that his real name was Fothergill. The psycho-analyst
doctor, who had all along been deeply interested in his
case, was more than ever interested now. He questioned him
further, about his birth, education, family, and so on,
and to every question A.J. gave full and simple, answers,
no longer wishing to conceal anything if concealment were
to mean being flung back into the chaos of the world
around.</p>

<p>All these particulars, together with the doctor's
earnest recommendation, were sent to the American Embassy
at Constantinople, with the request that the hitherto
mysterious but now elucidated Fothergill should be given
a visa and allowed to proceed with the Relief detachment
to America, where his services would continue to be of
value. After a week or so came a somewhat curious reply.
The visa could not be granted, but one of the attachés
had been so interested in the case that he had got into
touch with a friend of his in a British Military Mission.
This friend knew the Fothergill family, it appeared, and
knew, further, that one of them, presumably a brother of
the applicant, had been an officer in Palestine during the
War, and was now, he believed, stationed in Cairo awaiting
demobilisation.</p>

<p>The American doctor informed A.J. of this, and
suggested that he should proceed to Cairo on the trail of
the long-lost brother. A.J. agreed, willing enough for
anything, and after some further delay was provided with a
<i>visa</i> from the British authorities at Constantinople.</p>

<p>He left Odessa on August 11th, 1919, and arrived in
Cairo a week later. Captain William Fothergill had been
informed, and the two men met at Shepheard's Hotel.
Neither, of course, could recognise the other, but by the
time the second cocktail appeared they were in no doubt as
to their proved brotherhood. As befitted Englishmen in such
an emergency, they were restrained almost to the point of
being embarrassed. "I suppose you must have had all sorts
of adventures, living in Russia throughout the Revolution?"
Captain William Fothergill remarked, with one finger
running down the wine-list; and A.J. answered: "Oh yes, a
few."</p>

<p>Captain Fothergill was apt to be equally cursory about
his own personal affairs: he owned rubber and coconut
plantations in Sumatra which he had had to leave in the
hands of a 'damned artful Dutchman' during the period
of his war service. Now, of course, he was only waiting
for demobilisation to be off to Singapore by the first
available boat. "Seems to me you might as well come along
too, if you're at a loose end," he said, and A.J. replied:
"Yes, all right, I don't mind. Will there be any job for
me?"</p>

<p>"Oh Lord, yes, I can find you plenty to do. Ever looked
after niggers?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I don't mean real niggers&mdash;just Chinks and Malays,
you know. Queer fellers&mdash;all right as long as they've
got someone to keep a strict eye on 'em. If you can do
that, you'll be worth your weight in gold on any rubber
plantation."</p>

<p>Captain Fothergill's demobilisation papers arrived
before the end of the month, and the two brothers caught a
boat for Singapore, by way of Colombo, at the beginning of
October.</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="part5" name="part5">PART V</a></h2>

<p class="first">From the "Golden Arrow" at Victoria there
stepped a man whom the porters, even on that plutocratic
platform, singled out, attracted not so much by a leather
handbag plastered with foreign hotel-labels as by a certain
unanalysable but highly significant quietness of manner.
And the voice was equally quiet. "Taxi&mdash;yes, and
there are a trunk and two large suit-cases in the van. The
name is Fothergill." To the driver a few moments later he
said merely: "The Cecil." It was the only hotel he could
remember from the London of his youth.</p>

<p>They gave him a lofty bedroom overlooking the dazzling
semicircle of the Embankment, and he spent the first
few minutes gazing down at the trams and the electric
advertisements across the river. He was a little tired
after the journey, and a little thrilled by the sensation
of being in London again. He changed, though not into
evening clothes, and dined in the grill-room, chatting
desultorily with the waiter. Then he smoked a cigar in the
lounge and went up to his room rather early. In bed with a
novel, he heard Big Ben chime several successive quarters;
then he switched off the light and tried to believe that
this small, comfortable, well-carpeted, and entirely
characterless hotel bedroom was somehow different from
all the dozens of similar ones he had occupied in other
cities.</p>

<p>In the morning he breakfasted in bed, enjoyed a long
hot bath, made himself affable with the hotel-porter, and
strode out into the cheerful, sunny streets. There were so
many little odd jobs to do&mdash;some of which he had been
saving up for a long time. He saw his lawyer, and made an
appointment to see a Harley Street doctor later on in the
week. He called at a firm of publishers and heard that
his book <i>Rubber and the Rubber Industry</i> had crept into
a second edition. The publisher asked him to dinner the
following evening; he accepted. Then he bought some tics
and handkerchiefs and a hat of rather more English style
than the one he was wearing. By that time, as it was noon
and he was in the Strand, he stepped down to Romano's Bar
for a glass of sherry and exchanged a few words with the
dark-haired girl who served him. He liked, when he could,
to obtain the intimacy of talking to people without the
bother of knowing them, and that, of course, was always
more easily accomplished with one's so-called inferiors.
The barmaid at Romano's was a type he liked&mdash;pretty,
alert, friendly, and fundamentally virtuous. He asked her
what were the best shows to see, and she gave him the names
of several which he imagined he would be sure to detest
exceedingly. Then she asked if this were his first visit
to London, and he rather enjoyed answering: "My first for
twenty-three years. I used to live here." Afterwards he
lunched at Rule's in Maiden Lane&mdash;the first place he
found that seemed to him very little changed since the
old days. In the afternoon he took a 'bus to the Marble
Arch and walked through the September sunshine to Hyde
Park Corner and the Green Park, just in time for tea at
Rumpelmayer's. And after that there was nothing to do but
return to the Cecil, change into dinner clothes, and begin
the journey out to Surbiton.</p>

<p>"There is a good electric service from Waterloo," she
had written in her letter to him, and the sentence echoed
in his mind with fatuous profundity all the time he was
fixing his collar and tie in front of the bedroom mirror.
It was strange to be visiting a person whom you had not
seen for twenty-three years. It had been on impulse that
he had written to her, and he was not sure, even now,
that the impulse had been wise. She had married, of
course, a second time&mdash;that was something. She had
even a nineteen-year-old daughter. And, if one chanced
to think of it, she had the vote&mdash;that vote for
which in the past she had clamoured so much. She would be
forty-eight&mdash;his own age. Her letter had really told
him very little except that her name was now Newburn, that
she would be delighted to see him, and that there was that
good electric service from Waterloo.</p>

<p>When he arrived at Surbiton station an hour later he
declined a cab and enquired the way from a policeman.
The walk through placid suburban roads gave him a chance
to meditate, to savour in full the rich unusualness of
the situation. He lit a cigarette, stopped a moment to
watch some boys playing with a dog, kicked a few pieces
of orange-peel into the gutter with an automatic instinct
for tidiness; it was past seven before he found the house.
It looked smaller than he had expected (for, after all,
hadn't she inherited the bulk of old Jergwin's fortune?);
just a detached suburban villa with sham gables and a
pretentious curved pathway between the garden-gate and the
porch. The maid who opened the door to his ring took his
hat and coat and showed him into a drawing-room tastefully
if rather depressingly furnished. He stood with his back to
the fire-grate and continued to wonder what she would look
like.</p>

<p>She came in with her daughter. She was rather thin
and pale and eager, and the daughter was a large-limbed
athletic-looking girl who moved about the room as if it
were a hockey-pitch.</p>

<p>"Isn't it romantic, Ainsley, for you to have come back
after all these years?"</p>

<p>He found himself shaking hands and being presented to
the girl. "I suppose it is," he answered, smiling. Rather
to his astonishment he felt perfectly calm. He began to
chatter pointlessly about the journey. "Found nay way quite
easily&mdash;as you said, the service is very good. Didn't
think I'd be here half so quickly. You must be pretty far
out of town, though&mdash;twenty miles, I should guess."</p>

<p>"Twelve," the girl corrected.</p>

<p>They began to discuss Surbiton. Then the maid brought
in complicated and rather sugary cocktails. They continued
to discuss Surbiton. By that time he was beginning
to anticipate the arrival of Mr. Newburn with almost
passionate eagerness, and was rather surprised when they
adjourned to the dining-room without waiting for the
gentleman. "Is Mr. Newburn away?" he asked, noticing that
places were only laid for three. The girl answered, with
outright simplicity: "Father died two years ago."</p>

<p>Well, that was that, and there was nothing for it but
to look sympathetic and change the subject. So, to avoid
at all costs the resumption of the Surbiton discussion, he
began to talk about Paris, Vienna, and other cities he had
lived in during recent years. The girl said: "Mother told
me you were in Russia during the Revolution. Do tell us
about it!" He smiled and answered: "Well, ell, you know,
there was a revolution and a lot of shooting and trouble
of most kinds&mdash;I don't know that I can remember
much more." She then said: "I suppose you saw Lenin and
Trotsky?"&mdash;and he replied: "No, never&mdash;and
neither of them. I'm rather a fraud, don't you think?"</p>

<p>Then Philippa chatted about various causes and
enterprises she was connected with; they ranged from
a hospital for crippled children and a birth-control
clinic to Esperanto and Dalcroze eurhythmics. He listened
tolerantly, but shook his head when she offered to show
him authentic photographs of slum children suffering from
rickets. "I'll willingly subscribe to them," he said, "but
I never care to have my feelings harrowed after a good
dinner." The girl choked with laughter. "I don't blame
you," she said. "I think they're horrible photographs, and
mother <i>will</i> show them to everybody." Philippa replied: "I
show them because they <i>are</i> so horrible&mdash;people ought
to realise the horrible things that go on in the world."
He felt suddenly sorry for her then, and said: "It's a
splendid cause, I'm sure, and I didn't mean to make fun.
You will let me send you a cheque, won't you?"</p>

<p>But he soon perceived that his compassion had been
unnecessary. She was tough; she was thick-skinned; she was
obviously used to all kinds of gibes. When she told him
that it was her habit to stand at street-corners lecturing
about birth-control, he felt that he need no longer be
afraid of hurting her feelings. He was more sorry, then,
for the girl; she was such an ordinary, straightforward,
averagely decent girl.</p>

<p>They took coffee in the drawing-room, and when they were
comfortably smoking, Philippa suddenly said: "My husband
isn't really dead&mdash;my daughter had to tell you that
because the maid was there and that is what we tell <i>her</i>.
The truth is, he left me."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>Then she launched into a detailed account of the
catastrophe of her second marriage. The man had been
a labour organiser, and he had run off with a girl
secretary. He had also speculated with his wife's money
and lost most of it. It was all a rather pathetic
story, taking so long to tell that by the time it was
nearly over he was having to look at his watch and make
hints about a return train. Then followed the usual
conventionalities. It had been a most charming evening,
he assured her&mdash;delightful to have seen her again.
She urged him to stay the night, but he said he thought
he wouldn't&mdash;all his things at his hotel, and so
on. She said she hoped they would meet again soon. She
told him that she ran a little informal literary circle
that met on alternate Wednesdays in her drawing-room. "We
read each other papers, you know&mdash;not necessarily
on literary subjects&mdash;sometimes we get strangers to
talk to us&mdash;Mr. Wimpole, for instance, gave us a most
fascinating chat about old English silver last week. I
was wondering, you see, whether you would care to tell us
a few of your experiences in Russia; if you would, I am
sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he replied, smiling and shaking his head: "My dear
Philippa, none of my Russian experiences were nearly so
dreadful as the one you are suggesting." The girl again
laughed. "I'm afraid I'll have to refuse&mdash;that sort of
thing really isn't in my line at all."</p>

<p>It was raining and the girl went to the telephone to
ring for a taxi. While she was away, Philippa contrived a
word or two <i>tête-à-tête</i>; she said: "You know, Ainsley,
I do hope you'll soon he conning again and then you must
arrange to stay at least for a week-end. I dare-say
'you've found it rather odd, meeting me and my daughter
together like this&mdash;there have been restraints, I
know&mdash;lots of things I haven't cared to tell you in
front of her. And perhaps you too&mdash;what have you been
doing, really, since I saw you last? We must meet again
soon and tell each other <i>everything</i>." Hearing the girl
approaching, she added: "Anyway, now that you're intending
to make a home in England, we shall simply insist on
getting to know you."</p>

<p>But he was not intending to make a home in England, he
reflected a few moments later, as he sat in the corner of
the cab.</p>

<p>In his hotel bedroom that night he felt a slow and
rather comfortable disappointment soaking into him.
Subconsciously he knew he had been expectant over this
meeting with Philippa; now he realised, not without relief,
that all such expectancy had vanished. It wasn't only she
who had failed him, but he who had failed himself. He
didn't want to know anybody in that eager, confidential
way; he had no energy for it; he would rather chat with a
stranger in a train whom he would never sec again. It had
been a mistake to go to Surbiton; perhaps it had been a
mistake even to come to England.</p>

<p>The next morning, after he had talked to the girl in
Romano's Bar-about some theatres he was intending to
visit, she said: "You seem to go about a lot by yourself.
Haven't you any friends?"</p>

<p>"Not in London," he replied. "A few people the other
side of the world&mdash;mostly Chinamen. That's all." He
liked to see her eyebrows arch in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I say! Fancy being friends with Chinamen! But you must
know <i>somebody</i> in London, if you used to live here?"</p>

<p>"A few business acquaintances, but I don't count them.
Oh, and two people in Surbiton. I went to see them last
night, but I don't suppose I shall go again."</p>

<p>"Why not? Weren't they nice to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. Rather nicer, perhaps, than I was to them."</p>

<p>"Then why&mdash;"</p>

<p>He laughed. "Never mind. I hardly know myself. But you
can fill me up another glass of sherry and have one with
me."</p>

<p>"Righto, and thanks, though mine's a gin, if you don't
mind... Well, here's luck to you, anyway."</p>

<p>Once he toyed with the idea of asking her out to some
theatre or music-hall, but he decided, on reflection and
without any sort of snobbishness, that the perfection of
their relationship depended on the counter between.</p>

<p>He staved in London over a week, and on the whole he
enjoyed himself. He dined at his publisher's town house and
met there a man on the staff of <i>The Times</i> who promptly
commissioned from him a series of articles on the future
of the rubber industry. It gratified and perhaps slightly
surprised him to realise that his book had become, in its
own field, something of a classic.</p>

<p>He also vent to theatres, cinemas, exhibitions; he
walked in the parks; he listened to the open-air speakers
near the Marble Arch; he lunched and dined in any hotel or
restaurant that chanced to catch his eye; he sat in the
Embankment gardens and pencilled drafts of his <i>Times</i>
articles; he had casual and agreeable chats with policemen
and bus-conductors. Philippa wrote to him, inviting him
to Surbiton for any week-end he liked and he wrote back
thanking her, but fearing that his arrangements would so
soon be taking him temporarily out of London that he could
not settle anything just yet. He enclosed, however, five
guineas for her slum children, and hoped she would forgive
him.</p>

<p>Then one morning he went to Harley Street to be examined
and overhauled by a specialist. He went quite calmly and
came away equally so. It was about noon, and he took a
taxi back to the hotel, where he found a letter awaiting
him&mdash;one he had been expecting. After reading it
through he said to the bureau-clerk: "I shall be leaving
to-morrow." Then he stepped out into the sunshine and
walked across the Strand to Romano's Bar. The dark-haired
girl placed his sherry before him with a smile. "Here
again," she said. "You're becoming one of our regulars."</p>

<p>"Not for long, I'm afraid," he answered. "I'm off
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Ireland."</p>

<p>"Business?"</p>

<p>"In a way, yes."</p>

<p>"Going for long?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, really."</p>

<p>"It's queer, seems to me, the way you don't know
anybody and don't seem to know even things about yourself.
Fact is, I'm beginning to think you must be a queer one
altogether."</p>

<p>He laughed. "I had a queer sort of adventure this
morning, anyway. Went to a doctor and was told I ought to
give up smoking and drinking, go to bed early every night,
and avoid all excitements. What would you do, now, if your
doctor told you that about yourself?"</p>

<p>"I don't suppose I'd take any notice of it."</p>

<p>"Quite right, and I don't suppose <i>I</i> shall either."</p>

<p>"Go on!" she laughed. "You don't look ill! I don't
believe you went to any doctor at all&mdash;you're just
having me on!"</p>

<p>"Honestly, I'm not. It's as true as those Chinese
friends of mine."</p>

<p>He joked with her for a little longer and then went
to lunch at Simpson's. Afterwards he returned to the
hotel, wrote a few letters, and began to pack his bags in
readiness for the morrow. Then he went out for a stroll; he
walked up to Covent Garden Market, where there were always
interesting scenes, and then westward towards Charing Cross
Road, where he liked to look at the bookshops. But he felt
himself becoming very tired long before he reached this
goal, so he turned into the familiar Maiden Lane for a
drink and a rest at Rule's. But it wanted a quarter of an
hour to opening time, he discovered, when he reached the
closed door, and as his tiredness increased, he entered the
little Catholic church almost opposite and sat down amidst
the cool and grateful dusk.</p>

<p>He felt refreshed after a few minutes and began to walk
round the church, examining the mural tablets; in doing
so, without looking where he was going, he almost collided
with a young priest who was also walking round. Apologies
were exchanged, and conversation followed. The priest, it
appeared, was not attached to the church; he was merely a
sightseer, like Fothergill himself. He was from Lancashire,
he said, on a business visit to London; when he had time
to spare he liked going into churches&mdash;"a sort of
'busman's holiday," he added, with a laugh. He was a very
cheerful, friendly person, and Fothergill, who liked casual
encounters with strangers, talked to him for some time in
the porch of the church as they went out. Then it suddenly
occurred to both of them that there was no absolute need
to cut short a conversation that had begun so promisingly;
they walked down Bedford Street to the Strand, still
talking, and with no very definite objective. The priest,
whose name was Farington, said he was going to have a
meal somewhere and take a night train back to Lancashire;
Fothergill said he was also going to have dinner. Farington
then said that he usually took a snack at Lyon's Corner
House, near Charing Cross; Fothergill said, all right, that
would do for him too. So they dined together inexpensively
and rather uncomfortably, surrounded by marble and gilt and
the blare of a too strident orchestra.</p>

<p>Yet Fothergill enjoyed it. He liked Farington. He liked
Farington's type of mind&mdash;intellectual, sincere,
interested in all kinds of matters outside the scope of
religion, worldly to those who saw only the surface,
spiritual to those who guessed deeper. He was emphatically
not the kind of man to insist on rendering to God the
things which were Caesar's. During the meal Fothergill
chanced to mention something about rubber plantations, and
Farington said immediately: "I say, didn't you tell me your
name was Fothergill? I wonder, now you're talking about
rubber, whether you're the Fothergill who used to be at
Kuala Simur?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am."</p>

<p>"That's odd. It means I know quite a lot about
you&mdash;Father Richmond and I are great friends&mdash;we
were at Ware together."</p>

<p>"Really? Oh yes, I remember him very well. Where is he
now?"</p>

<p>"Still at Kuala Simur. He had a great opinion of
you&mdash;especially after that small-pox epidemic."</p>

<p>"Oh, that wasn't much."</p>

<p>Farington laughed. "It's too conventional to say that,
surely? I wish you could sec some of Richmond's letters
about you, anyway&mdash;he almost hero-worshipped."</p>

<p>"I hope not."</p>

<p>"He did. His great dream, I think, was to convert you
some day."</p>

<p>"Well, he didn't come far short of doing so."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"We used to argue a good deal about religion and so
on&mdash;and I used to joke with him and say I should end
by becoming a Catholic. At least, perhaps he thought I was
joking, but all the time, in a sort of way, I meant it.
Then my brother died and all the rubber estates fell to me,
and I got suddenly fed up with everything and sold out.
That just happened to be right at the top of the rubber
boom in 'twenty-five, which is why I'm more or less a rich
man now. I sold out to an Anglo-Dutch syndicate, packed
up, and pottered about Europe from then till now. The
syndicate, incidentally, paid me about five times what the
place is worth to-day."</p>

<p>"That must have been very good for your bank
account."</p>

<p>"Better than for my soul, perhaps, eh? To come back
to that, the rather curious thing is that all the time
I was at Kuala Simur I felt a sort of conversion going
on&mdash;if you can call it that&mdash;I know of course
that nothing really counts until you're definitely over the
line. Probably if I'd had much more to do with your friend
Richmond, whom I liked exceedingly, he'd have pushed me
over."</p>

<p>"I wish that had happened."</p>

<p>"Oh well, I pushed myself over a year later, so perhaps
it didn't matter."</p>

<p>"So you <i>are</i> a Catholic?"</p>

<p>"I was received into the Church in Vienna three years
ago. I'm not sure that I'm entitled to call myself a
Catholic now, though. Slackness, I suppose. All very
unsatisfactory from your point of view, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"And from yours too, surely?"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps&mdash;perhaps."</p>

<p>They talked on for some time, and Fothergill found it
strangely and refreshingly easy to be intimate with the
young man. Farington's train was due to leave at midnight,
and towards nine o'clock Fothergill suggested that they
should adjourn to his hotel for a smoke. They walked along
the crowded Strand to the Cecil and were soon snugly in the
lounge. There and then conversation developed as if all
barriers had suddenly been destroyed. Fothergill said: "You
know, Farington, there was one thing I never told Richmond
and that was the whole truth about my life."</p>

<p>"I know. He used to grumble about that in his letters to
me. He said he was sure you had some mysterious and grisly
past which you never breathed a word about to anybody."</p>

<p>"Really? He guessed that? How curious!"</p>

<p>"Well, we priests aren't such simpletons, you know."</p>

<p>Fothergill laughed. "I'll bet he never guessed the sort
of past it had been, though. I daresay I'd have told him if
I hadn't known him so well. As a matter of fact, I knew he
liked me and I liked him to like me, and I didn't want to
see my stock going down with a bump... You see, I seem to
have broken so many of the commandments."</p>

<p>"Most of us have."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I've gone rather the whole hog. I've killed
men, for instance."</p>

<p>"If you walked out now into the Strand you could find
hundreds of middle-aged fellows who've done that."</p>

<p>"Oh, the war&mdash;yes, but my affairs weren't in
the war&mdash;at least, hardly. One of them was pretty
cold-blooded murder. And then there are other matters, too.
I never married, but I lived with a woman&mdash;once."</p>

<p>"That, again, is nothing very unusual."</p>

<p>"I daresay not, but if my soul depended on it, I
couldn't say I was sorry. It's the one thing in my life
which I feel was fully and definitely right."</p>

<p>"Of course, without knowing the circumstances&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If You've time, and if you think you wouldn't be bored,
I'll tell You how it all happened."</p>

<p>"I wish you would."</p>

<p>"Splendid." And he began at the day he left England
twenty-three years before. About three-quarters of an hour
later, when he came hoarsely to an end, Farington said:
"Well, that's really a most astonishing story. How relieved
you must be to have told it to somebody!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's just what I'm feeling. Relieved and rather
tired."</p>

<p>"Not too tired to continue our chat for another
half-hour or so. I hope?"</p>

<p>"Provided you do most of the talking."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll engage to do that." He kept his word, and
the conversation continued until it was absolutely
necessary for him to leave to catch the train. Fortunately
his bag was at the station, so that he could proceed
there directly. Fothergill, strangely eager despite his
tiredness, accompanied him in the taxi, and their talk
lasted until the moment the train began to move. "We
probably shan't meet again," Fothergill said, as they shook
hands, "but I shall never forget how&mdash;how <i>reasonable</i>
you have been. Does that sound a rather tepid word in the
circumstances?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. Just the right one, I should like to
think. Though there's no reason why we shouldn't meet
sometime&mdash;you have my address&mdash;it's only a
train-ride out of Manchester."</p>

<p>"I hate tram-rides and I'm sure I should hate
Manchester." He laughed excitedly, and was aware of
the silliness of the remark. He added, more soberly:
"In my old age I'm beginning to attach great value to
comfort&mdash;just comfort."</p>

<p>"Old age, man&mdash;nonsense! You're not fifty yet!"</p>

<p>"One is made old, not by one's years, but by what
one has lived through. That's sententious enough,
surely&mdash;another sign of age." The train began to move.
"I shan't forget, however. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"I must make the most, then, of your rubber articles in
<i>The Times</i>. Good-bye then." They laughed distantly at each
other as the train gathered speed.</p>

<p>He drove back to the hotel with all his senses warmed
and glowing. On what trifles everything depended&mdash;if
he had not made for Rule's that evening and been those few
minutes too early!</p>

<p>In a corner seat of a first-class compartment on the
Irish Mail the next morning, he had leisure to think
everything over. So much had happened the day before.
But the interview with the Harley Street man hadn't
surprised him; he had been suspecting something of the
sort for several months, and wasn't worrying; there was no
pain&mdash;at worst a sort of tiredness. He would take a
few but not all the precautions he had been recommended,
and leave the rest to Fate.</p>

<p>He opened a small attaché-case on the seat beside him
and took out letters and papers. The proofs of his first
<i>Times</i> article&mdash;how well it looked&mdash;'by Ainsley
Jergwin Fothergill, author of <i>Rubber and the Rubber
Industry</i>'! He seemed to be staring appreciatively at the
work of another person&mdash;the hardworking, painstaking
person who had spent five years in Kuala Simur. Five years
of self-discipline and orderliness, with the little rubber
trees all in line across the hillside to typify a certain
inner domestication of his own soul. He had liked the
plantation work; it had given him grooves just when most of
all he had wanted grooves. To save himself he had plunged
into rubber-growing with a fervour that had startled
everybody, especially poor William; he had worked, read,
written, thought, and lived rubber for five years. And
the result, by an ironic twist of fortune, had come to be
two things he had never known before&mdash;a status and a
private income.</p>

<p>He turned over a few letters. One from his publisher,
enclosing a cheque for six months' royalties and suggesting
a small 'popular' book in a half-crown series to be called
just 'Rubber'&mdash;something rather chatty and not too
technical&mdash;could he do it?... It would be rather
interesting to try, at any rate... A letter from Philippa,
thanking him for his subscription to her slum children, and
hoping he would manage a visit soon&mdash;he could come
any time he liked and stay as long as he liked&mdash;"both
Sybil and I are looking forward so much to seeing you
again."</p>

<p>He would never, in all probability, see either of them
again.</p>

<p>A letter from a firm of enquiry agents in New York City,
dated several months back and addressed to him in Paris:
"With reference to your recent enquiry, we regret that up
to the present we have found it impossible to obtain any
information. We are, however, continuing to investigate,
and will report to you immediately should any development
occur."</p>

<p>Another letter, some weeks later: "<i>Re</i> Mary Denver,
we are at last able to report progress. It appears that
the child was adopted by a family named Consett, of Red
Springs, Colorado, middle-class people of English descent,
moderately well-off. Mr. Consett died in 1927. We have had
difficulty in tracing the rest of the family since then.
They left Red Springs, and are believed to have gone to
Philadelphia. We are continuing our enquiries." A third
letter, dated three weeks back:</p>

<p>"We are now able to inform you that Mrs. Consett and
daughter crossed the Atlantic in November of last year and
spent Christmas at Algiers. Our European representative, to
whom we have cabled instructions, will take the matter in
hand as from there." A fourth letter, from this European
representative, conveying the information that the Consetts
had left Algiers with the intention of touring in France,
Germany, and the United Kingdom. Pretty vague, that,
but a fifth letter had narrowed it down to 'England and
Ireland,' and a sixth letter&mdash;the one that had arrived
only the day before&mdash;had stated, with admirable
definiteness: "I understand that Mrs. and Miss Consett left
Stratford-on-Avon on Tuesday last and crossed to Ireland.
They are now believed to be staying at the Shelburne Hotel,
Dublin."</p>

<p>He gathered the letters into a pile and took them into
the dining-car with him when he went to lunch. He was on
the right-hand side of the train, whence he could see the
North Wales coast, blue sea and sandy shore, streaming past
the window like a cinema-film. Crowds of holiday-makers,
pierrot entertainers, bathers bobbing up and down in the
water, a sudden jangle of goods-yard, a station, a tunnel,
the sea and shore again, deserted for an odd half-mile
or so; then bungalows, boardinghouses, a promenade, a
bandstand, bathing-huts, crowds, a jangle of goods-yard,
a station&mdash;on, on, beyond the soup to the fish and
the underdone roast beef of that very English and mediocre
train-lunch.</p>

<p>He arrived in Dublin at seven that night, and drove
straight to the Shelburne. The Consetts, he learned from
the hotel porter, had gone on to Killarney two days before.
"Americans, sir. See Killarney and die&mdash;you know the
kind of thing? After that, I expect they'll be rushing to
kiss the Blarney Stone."</p>

<p>He stayed at the Shelburne for the night and caught
the morning express to Killarney. The porter at the
Shelburne had given him the names of some of the more
likely hotels, and it was easy to drive from one to another
making enquiries. At a third asking he discovered that the
Consetts had left that morning for Carrigole, Co. Cork,
where they were almost bound to be staying at Roone's
Hotel.</p>

<p>There was no railway to Carrigole, so he hired a car
to drive him the forty-odd miles over the hills. It was a
marvellous summer afternoon, just beginning to fade into
the soft glow of evening; by the time he reached the top
of the pass and the driver pointed out Carrigole harbour
in the distance, all the world seemed melting into a
rarefied purple dusk. After the metropolitan bustle of
Dublin and the stage-Irishry of Killarney, this, he felt,
was the real Ireland, and immediately, in a way he hardly
understood, he felt kinship with it. Successive days of
travel had increased his fatigue, but the calm, tranquil
mountain-air was uplifting him, giving him satisfaction,
almost buoyancy.</p>

<p>It was dark when he reached Roone's, and the yellow
oil-lamps were lit in the tiled hall and under the
built-out verandah. Somehow by instinct, as he took his
first step into that cool interior, lie knew that he would
have to go no further, and for that reason he did not ask
about the Consetts when he booked a room. All that would
come later; he must give himself the pleasure of doing
everything sweetly and with due proportion. "May I have
dinner?" he enquired, and was directed to a room whose
windows, ranging from floor to ceiling along one side,
showed the still darkly glowing harbour with the mountains
brooding over it as in some ancient, kindly conspiracy.</p>

<p>The room was fairly full, but he had a table to himself,
and the dinner was good. The faces of others glowed
yellow-brown in the lamplight; the night was full of
talking and laughing, the bark of a dog, the hoot of cars
entering the drive; yet permeating it all, in a queer way,
there was silence&mdash;silence such as seemed to rise out
of the very earth and sea to meet the sky.</p>

<p>He chatted to the waiter; it was his first visit to
Carrigole, he explained, or, for that matter, to Ireland at
all. "You seem pretty full&mdash;the height of the season,
I daresay?"</p>

<p>"Just a little past it, sir. We get a lot of American
tourists in July and August, but most of them are beginning
to go back by now."</p>

<p>"Ah yes. I suppose, though, a few of the people here now
are Americans?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, quite a number. Most of them come on from
Killarney and stay here a night or so on their way to
Cork."</p>

<p>He did not enquire further, but that evening, after
dinner, the problem became merely one of identification.
For he was asked to sign the hotel register, and as he
wrote "A.J. Fothergill&mdash;London&mdash;British" he
glanced up the column of names and read in plain round
handwriting a few inches above&mdash;"Mrs. and Miss
Consett, Philadelphia."</p>

<p>He lit a cigar and took coffee in the lounge and
wondered who they might be among the faces that passed him
by. It would be simple, of course, to enquire directly, to
approach them with equal directness, to introduce himself
remarkably and dramatically, to talk till midnight about
the exceeding singularity of the fate that had linked, then
sundered, and now linked again his life and the girl's.
Yet he shrank from it; his mind was sore from drama,
aching for some quieter contact, for something at first
and perhaps always remote. He wanted everything to be
peaceful, gradual, even if it were additionally intricate;
he wanted to preserve some path of secret retreat, so that
at any moment, if he grew too tired, he could escape into
forgotten anonymity. Yet, on the other hand, there was an
urgency in the matter that he could not avoid, for the
Consetts might not be staving at Carrigole for long, and he
could not undertake to follow them all over the world.</p>

<p>Chance came to his aid. The post arrived at Roone's
rather late; he saw the bundle of letters brought in by
the cyclist-postman and handed across the counter to Mrs.
Roone, who began to sort them. A cluster of people gathered
around, and suddenly he heard a girl's voice asking if
there were anything for Mrs. Consett.</p>

<p>There was, and she took a letter, studying its envelope
as she walked away across the tiled hall to a table under
the verandah where a woman sat reading a magazine.</p>

<p>For a moment he did not look at either of them; all had
happened so calmly and comfortably. Then he suddenly knew
that his heart was beating very fast. That would never do.
He must see them; he must know what they were like. He got
up and strolled deliberately by, puffing at his cigar and
appearing to stare through the windows at nothing. The
woman was plump, cheerful, talkative, fairly attractive;
but the girl was less ordinary. She was quiet, rather
well-featured, with calm brown eyes that were looking at
him before his dared to look at her. That was curious, he
thought, that she should have stared first.</p>

<p>He went to bed, slept well, and was down early for
breakfast. The Consetts came in later, but to a table at
the other end of the room. During the meal the waiter asked
him if he would care to join an excursion to visit an
ancient hermitage some score miles away over the hills. "It
is quite interesting sir," he recommended, "and if you have
nothing else in mind, it would make a pleasant trip."</p>

<p>"Are most of the others going?"</p>

<p>"Practically everybody, sir, except the fishing
gentlemen."</p>

<p>"I don't want to have a lot of walking to do."</p>

<p>"There is hardly any&mdash;you just drive right there by
car."</p>

<p>"All right, I daresay I'll go."</p>

<p>It was a chance, he realised, and perhaps a better one
than many others.</p>

<p>Four large five-seater touring-cars were drawn up
outside the hotel. The excursionists arranged themselves
as they chose, usually, of course, manoeuvring to be with
their friends. It was natural that he should wait rather
diffidently until most had taken positions, and that, as
an odd man, he should be fitted into the back seat of
one of the cars with two other persons. Partly by luck
and partly by his own contrivance, those two compulsory
fellow-passengers were the Consetts. He was at one side of
the car, Mrs. Consett at the other; the girl sat in between
them. The driver and a large picnic-hamper shared the seat
in front.</p>

<p>The convoy set off at eleven o'clock through lanes full
of wildflowers and spattered with sunshine from a dappled
sky. The harbour, reaching out into the long narrow inlet,
gleamed like a sword-blade; the hills were purple-grey
and a little hazy in the distance. He passed some merely
polite remark about the weather, and the girl answered him
in the same key. But the woman, seizing the opportunity,
began to talk. She talked in a strong, copious stream, with
never-flagging zest and ever-increasing emphasis. Wasn't
Ireland lovely?&mdash;had he visited Killarney?&mdash;had
he been on the lake and on to the Gap of Dunloe? <i>They</i>
had&mdash;a most beautiful and romantic excursion, but the
flies had been a nuisance during the picnic-lunch, and the
food from the hotel had been just <i>awful</i>. It was a curious
thing, but the hotels over this side seemed to have no
idea... <i>etc., etc</i>.</p>

<p>He listened, occasionally venturing some remark. He
said, in response to questioning, that he had never been
to America, but had travelled a little in Europe. That
opened further flood-gates. He received a full and detailed
account of the Consett odyssey from the very day it had
begun at Philadelphia. Paris, Interlaken, the Rhine,
Munich, Innsbruck, Rome, Algiers, Seville (for Easter),
Biarritz, Lourdes, Chartres, Ostend, the battlefields,
London, Oxford, Cambridge, Stratford-on-Avon, Dublin ...
how much they had seen, even if how little! They had loved
it all, of course, and Mrs. Consett added, across the
girl, as it were: "Mary is just eighteen, you see, and
it is <i>such</i> an impressionable age, I think, and I <i>do</i>
so want her to see the world when she is young, because
later on, you know, one can never be sure of getting
such chances&mdash;in America so many women live narrow,
self-centred lives after they marry&mdash;they think
they're seeing the world if they spend a week in New York.
My own brothers and sisters, for instance, who live in
Colorado, have <i>never</i> travelled further than Los Angeles,
and even <i>I</i> never saw Europe till Mary and I landed last
fail. And now, though I'm <i>terribly</i> ashamed to think of
what I'd missed for so long, Vet I'm just glad to now that
Mary's seeing all these marvellous places at an age when
everything means most&mdash;the Coliseum at Rome, for
instance, and Westminster Abbey, and Shakespeare's <i>dear</i>
little house, and those <i>quaint</i> little jaunting-cars
they have at Killarney&mdash;have you been on them? We
had a most amusing driver to take us&mdash;so amusingly
Irish&mdash;I quite intended to make notes of some of his
remarks when I got back to the hotel, but I was just <i>too</i>
tired after the long drive, and it was <i>such</i> a beautiful
drive&mdash;rather like parts of Virginia..." And so on,
and so on.</p>

<p>They reached the hermitage about noon; it was a
collection of ruins on an island off the shore of a
lake&mdash;the latter overshadowed by gloomy mountains
and reached by a narrow, twisting road over a high pass.
The island was still a place of pilgrimage, and many of
the arched cells in which the hermits had lived were
littered with tawdry votive offerings&mdash;beads, buttons,
lead-pencils, pieces of ribbon&mdash;a quaint miscellany
for the rains and winds to disintegrate. The tourists
made the usual vague inspection and turned with relief to
the more exciting business of finding a place for lunch.
Fothergill still remained with the Consetts; indeed, rather
to his private amusement, he realised that it would have
been difficult to be rid of them in any case. Mrs. Consett
had by that time given him the almost complete history
of her family and was engaged on a minute explanation
of the way in which her husband had made money out of
steam-laundries. From that, as the picnic-lunch progressed,
she passed on to a sententious discussion of family life in
general and of the upbringing of children in particular. At
this point a sudden commotion amongst the rest of the party
gave the girl an excuse to move away, for which Fothergill
did not blame her, though it left him rather unhappily at
the mercy of Mrs. Consett. Soon, however, an opportunity
arose for himself also; the men of the party began to pack
up the hampers and carry them to the cars. He attached
himself to their enterprise for a sufficiently reasonable
time, and then strolled off on his own, deliberately
oblivious of the fact that Mrs. Consett was waiting for
him to resume his rôle of listener. He walked towards
the lake and across the causeway to the island&mdash;a
curious place, of interest to him because, with its
childlike testimonies of faith, it reminded him of things
he had seen in Russia. Was it too fanciful, he wondered,
to imagine a spiritual kinship between the countries? He
was thus reflecting when he saw the open doors of a small
modern chapel built amidst a grove of trees; and inside
the building, which was scarcely bigger than the room of
a small house, he caught sight of the girl. She heard his
footsteps and turned round, smiling slightly.</p>

<p>"I didn't notice this place when we first went round,"
he remarked, approaching.</p>

<p>"Neither did I. It's really so tiny, isn't
it?&mdash;quite the tiniest I've ever seen. And isn't it
terribly ugly?"</p>

<p>It was&mdash;garishly so in a style which again reminded
him of Russia. The comparison was so much on his mind that
without any ulterior motive he added: "I've seen the same
sort of thing abroad&mdash;especially in Russia. Simple
people always love crude colours and too much ornament."</p>

<p>She seized on that one vital word. "You know Russia,
then?"</p>

<p>"Fairly well. I used to live there."</p>

<p>"Did you like it?"</p>

<p>"Very much, in some ways."</p>

<p>"I wish mother and I could have gone there, but I
suppose it isn't really safe for tourists yet."</p>

<p>"I daresay it would be safe enough, but I should think
it would hardly be comfortable."</p>

<p>"Oh, then it wouldn't do at all." She laughed in a way
which Fothergill liked instantly and exceedingly&mdash;a
deep fresh laugh as from some spring-like fountain of
humour. "Mother hates hotels where you don't get a private
bathroom next to your bedroom."</p>

<p>"She can't be very keen on Roone's, then."</p>

<p>"I don't think she is, but I just love it. I'd hate
to find everything exactly like the Plaza at New York.
Besides, I don't think it <i>really</i> matters if you miss the
morning bath once now and again."</p>

<p>"No, I don't think it really does." And they smiled at
each other, sharing their first confidence.</p>

<p>As they left the chapel he was surprised to see her
genuflect; so she was a Catholic, then. That set him
thinking of the profound reasonableness of Catholics
in holding their faith in reverence while at the same
time being free to call one of their churches ugly if
it <i>were</i> ugly; and that, in turn, set him thinking of
the reasonableness of Father Farington, and of that long
conversation in London before he left... </p>

<p>She was saying: "What <i>is</i> your name, by the way?"</p>

<p>"Fothergill."</p>

<p>"Ours is Consett. I don't know whether you knew."</p>

<p>"I did, as a matter of fact. I overheard you asking for
letters last night."</p>

<p>"Oh, did you? That must have been before you passed
us on the verandah, then? I noticed you particularly
because&mdash;I daresay you'll smile at this&mdash;you
looked what in America we should call 'typically
English.'"</p>

<p>"'Typically English,' eh?" And for the first time for
some years he was thoroughly astonished. To be called
<i>that</i>, of all things!</p>

<p>She said: "The quiet way, I suppose, that Englishmen
have&mdash;a sort of look of being rather bored by
everything, though really they're not bored at all. Perhaps
I oughtn't to have said it, though&mdash;you don't look
very complimented."</p>

<p>He smiled. "'Would <i>you</i> be complimented if I were to
describe you as 'typically American?"</p>

<p>She paused a moment and then gave him a look of amused
candour. "That's rather clever of you, because I wouldn't.
And, anyhow, in my own case&mdash;" She stopped hurriedly,
and he said, holding open the wicket-gate for her to pass
from the island on to the causeway: "Yes, what were you
about to say?"</p>

<p>"I was really going to say that I'm not an American at
all."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>There was rather a long interval until she went on:
"It's queer to be telling you all this after knowing you
for about five minutes&mdash;I don't know what mother would
think. But, as it happens, you once lived in Russia, so
perhaps that's an excuse. I'm Russian."</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I came over with the refugees in 1919. That sounds
a bit like coming over with the Pilgrim Fathers, doesn't
it, but it's really not quite so illustrious. There were
just a few hundred refugee orphans who were allowed into
America before the government woke up and decided it didn't
want any more of them. They were all adopted into families
in various parts of the country. I was six when I came
over."</p>

<p>"That makes you how old now?"</p>

<p>"Just eighteen."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you remember much of your life in
Russia."</p>

<p>"Hardly anything. Sometimes I dream of things which
I think might have something to do with it. I wonder if
that's possible?"</p>

<p>"It might be."</p>

<p>"Here comes mother to meet us. I think I'd better tell
her how much I've told you."</p>

<p>The confession was made, and Mrs. Consett, after
hearing all the circumstances, bestowed her magnanimous
approval. It enabled her to continue the conversation
with Fothergill on rather more intimate lines, and this
she did all the way during the drive back to Roone's.
"So curious that we should all be learning about one
another so quickly, isn't it? But there, I always think
that one should take all the chances one can of making
friends wherever one goes&mdash;I'm sure Mary and I
have already met some <i>charming</i> people during our
trip&mdash;there was a most <i>delightful</i> man in the
hotel at Naples&mdash;a Swiss&mdash;only a commercial
traveller, I surmised&mdash;but still, who are we to be
snobbish? I'm sure I never try to conceal the fact that
my husband made his money out of other people's washing.
But this Swiss man, as I was saying, was such a pleasant
companion&mdash;he went to Pompeii with us to see those
wonderful Roman ruins&mdash;and lie was most helpful, too,
when we wanted to buy anything in the shops. I should
think he saved us quite a lot of money, for, as you know,
the Italians think every American must be a millionaire,
though, as a matter of fact, we're not really very
well-off&mdash;we've been saving up for this trip for
quite a time, haven't we, Mary?" And so on.</p>

<p>When they all reached Roone's again it was quite settled
that they should arrange with the waiter to have a larger
table, so that they could take meals together. They dined
that night, the three of them, by the side of the large
window, through which the harbour burned with little dark
specks on it that were the row-boats bringing the fishermen
ashore by dusk. After the out-door air and the long drive
over the mountains he felt tired, yet in a way that gave
him a certain rich serenity, breaking only into fitful
astonishment that she should be there, that he should have
found and spoken with her after so many years. But it was
she herself who astonished him most of all. The lamplight
touched the ivory white of her face with a glow of amber,
and there were five lamps, hung on chains from the ceiling,
making islands of light in the huge dark room. Her eyes
were like pools that might have been in a forest, and the
creamy sweep of her neck against that background reminded
him of some old brown Vandyke painting. Contentment closed
over him as he looked at her; Mrs. Consett's continual
talking echoed in his ears, yet somehow was not heard; all
about the room was chatter, rising to the roof and hovering
there, yet to him it was no more than a murmur&mdash;as if,
he thought fantastically, some monster choir at an immense
distance were intoning Latin genitive plurals.</p>

<p>So began a week of purest holiday. The Consetts, it
appeared, had no definite plans; they just stayed in one
place as long as they liked, and Roone's was apparently
suiting them, despite the lack of private bathrooms.
The weather, too, held out in a blaze of splendour just
beginning to be autumnal; every morning when Fothergill
rose and saw through his window the grey-green mountains
across the harbour he felt a surge of happiness that
reminded him, not of his own childhood, but of some
remoter and more marvellously recollected childhood
of the world. Then after breakfast came plans for the
day&mdash;delightful arguments in the verandah-lounge,
while Mrs. Roone was packing sandwiches for them, and
Roone was tapping the barometer and prophesying fine
weather. It was always Mrs. Consett who seemed to make
the plans, yet always Fothergill who did the real work
of organising&mdash;finding the route on road-maps,
seeing that food was sufficient, arranging terms with
motor-drivers. Then they would set out under the long
avenue of just fading leaves, swing down the winding
hill through the village, and up the further hill to
the mountains. He felt the years falling away from him
as he rose into that zestful air, and when they halted
for picnic-lunch at some lonely vantage-point, with the
valleys like clouds beneath them, he was a child again in
his enjoyment. He loved the fire-making routine&mdash;the
collecting of sticks on the hillsides, with the girl but
calling distance away from him, and her mother dozing in
the car a hundred feet below; the finding of large stones
to build a hearth; the careful watching till the kettle
boiled at last. Once, tempted by a glorious sunset, they
stayed late round a fire they had made at tea-time and
talked till the flames seemed to bring all the darkness
suddenly over their heads. As she stirred the fire to a
last blaze before they left it, the girl remarked on the
heat of the big stones, and he said: "If I were going to
camp here for the night I should wrap one of those stones
in a piece of blanket and use it instead of a hot-water
bottle. That's always a good dodge if you're sleeping
out."</p>

<p>"Have you ever slept out?"</p>

<p>"Oh, often."</p>

<p>"You seem to have done all kinds of things."</p>

<p>"<i>Many</i> kinds of things, perhaps."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd tell some of your adventures."</p>

<p>"I might, some time."</p>

<p>Yet he continually put it off. Partly, of course,
because it was always easier to do so; Mrs. Consett's
chatter was a strong current that could be swum against,
but it was far less trouble to relax and let it carry
one along. And partly, too, because he felt a curious
reluctance to break the tranquillity of those simple days,
and what tranquillity or simplicity could remain after he
had told his entire story?</p>

<p>He had, in fact, few chances of talking to the girl
alone, and he could not, he felt, tell her the final
secret&mdash;her own identity&mdash;at any other time.</p>

<p>One night, after dinner, someone brought a gramophone
into the tiled hall and put on dance records. The girl
asked him if he danced and he replied, smiling: "I'm afraid
I don't&mdash;I never learned, and I'm too old now."
She said: "I'll teach you, then," and as other couples
were by that time moving from their seats, he replied,
with sudden decision: "Will you? All right." He found it
easy; she was a good pilot, and he himself had a sure
sense of rhythm. "As if you were too old to learn," she
whispered, reproachfully, as they drifted in amidst the
lamp-lit shadows. "I don't think you're really too old for
anything."</p>

<p>"Although I'm nearly three times your own age?"</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter. You don't <i>feel</i> old, do you? And
if anyone saw you when you were making a fire for a picnic,
they'd think you were only a boy."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I was watching you this afternoon. You were
enjoying it, weren't you?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely, I admit."</p>

<p>"So was I. I don't think I've ever got to know anybody
so quickly as I have you. It seems rather an awful thing
to say, but sometimes&mdash;sometimes I wish mother wasn't
quite so&mdash;so <i>everywhere</i>&mdash;and <i>always</i>; she's a
dear, but she does chatter terribly, doesn't she?"</p>

<p>"Just as well, perhaps, because I'm not much of a talker
myself."</p>

<p>"Neither am I, yet I'd rather like to give ourselves a
chance. By the way, were you once a rubber planter out in
the Malay States?"</p>

<p>"Sumatra, it was. But how did you know?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mother seems to have been finding out all about
you. She happened to see an article in the London <i>Times</i>,
and thought it must be you, from the name and initials.
Then someone else told her&mdash;some people staying here,
but I think they've gone now&mdash;that you'd been a
planter out there and had made heaps of money."</p>

<p>"It depends how much you mean by heaps."</p>

<p>She laughed. "Personally, I'm not very curious, but
mother seems to think you're a millionaire travelling
incognito, or something of that sort."</p>

<p>He laughed also. "You can contradict the rumour," he
assured leer.</p>

<p>They went on dancing. They danced, in fact, with hardly
a pause until nearly midnight, and when they finally
rejoined Mrs. Consett he said, with eyes and cheeks
glowing: "Your daughter is a most charming teacher. I hope
we haven't been allowing the lesson to last too long?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all&mdash;not at all." Indeed, she seemed
quite pleased.</p>

<p>He was tired that night when he went to bed, but it
was the sort of tiredness to be expected after a day on
the mountains and an evening of fox-trots. Curiously,
in a way, he felt much better since he had begun the
more strenuous life of Roone's; it seemed to tire him
far less to scramble up a mountain in search of fuel for
a picnic-fire than to take leisurely strolls along city
pavements.</p>

<p>The girl and he had more time together during the
second week; there were occasions when Mrs. Consett
professed fatigue and said she would write letters in the
lounge while they, if they cared, took a walk. Roone's
was growing emptier; the eight months' season of slack
business was approaching and the first gales of autumn had
already laid bare the trees in the woods. As an offset to
the general exodus of visitors, a light cruiser came to
anchor in Carrigole Bay for a few days' visit. Most of
the officers and men carne ashore to Roone's; bluejackets
swarmed into the public bar, while the hall and the long
verandah terraces were filled with shouting and laughing
naval officers. Every night they kept up their merriment
to a late hour, and most of the day a group of them hung
about the counter in the hall, chatting and joking with the
Roones.</p>

<p>One morning Fothergill and the girl made the ascent of
the Baragh, a steep, cone-shaped peak that rose a thousand
feet at the back of the hotel. An hour of scrambling
through heather brought them to the summit, whence could
be seen the roofs of Carrigole and the long bay stretching
westward into the sunlit sea.</p>

<p>NOW, he felt, as he sat on a rough stone with the sweep
of sea and mountain all around him and the girl seated on
another stone somewhat below,&mdash;<i>now</i> was just his
chance. He could talk without interruption; he could begin
at the beginning and tell all that was to be told.</p>

<p>Yet he didn't even begin to tell. Another thought
carne to him&mdash;that in all the world she was probably
the only person he would ever meet who had ever known
Daly&mdash;the sole surviving contact with all in his own
life that had mattered most. And that dark passion of his,
subdued for years, spilled over now in a little tender
flood of affection for the girl.</p>

<p>Suddenly she said: "Do you remember I told you I
sometimes had dreams that might have something to do with
the time before I left Russia?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"I had a dream of that sort last night. Too queer to be
remembered, really, but the queerest part was that you were
mixed up in it somehow."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> was?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We seemed to be going somewhere all the
time&mdash;just one place after another&mdash;and at
night we slept out in the open and used hot stones for
water-bottles." She laughed. "Isn't it curious the way
everything gets mixed up in dreams?"</p>

<p>The chance to tell her was again full on him, yet once
again he forbore. He was still wrestling with memories of
those old and epic days. He said, abruptly: "Are you happy
in America? What do you do there? Tell me the kind of life
you have."</p>

<p>She looked amused. "I rather thought mother had told you
everything you ever wanted to hear about our home life. As
a matter of fact, we really <i>do</i> have a good time and get
on splendidly together. We play a little bridge and tennis
(though we're both very bad), and we just have money enough
to travel now and again and go to theatres and have friends
to stay with us. I shall have to earn my own living, of
course, for which I'm rather glad&mdash;I think it's a
mistake to do nothing but idle about and wait to be married
by somebody."</p>

<p>"Don't you wish you'd been born rich, or high up in the
world&mdash;a princess, say?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind if I'd been born rich, though I don't
suppose it would have made me any happier. And as for being
a princess, when I feel romantic I sometimes try to kid
myself that I <i>am</i> one&mdash;after all, nobody knows who I
really am, do they?"</p>

<p>"I suppose not."</p>

<p>"Though I daresay I wouldn't really like it if I were.
It must be very tiresome having to be important all the
time. It would stop me from doing things like this,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Like this?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Scrambling up a mountain with you."</p>

<p>He laughed&mdash;a sudden almost boyish laugh that
startled the mountain silences. "Yes, you're right. You're
happier as you are, no doubt."</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> I am. Oh, it <i>has</i> been such fun, travelling
all over Europe ever since nearly a year ago, and the
strange thing is, it all somehow seems to have been leading
up to this. I mean this&mdash;here&mdash;now&mdash;just
<i>this</i>." She looked at him quickly and then stared far
across the distance to the furthest horizon. "I like these
mountains ever so much better than the Swiss ones, don't
you? I suppose it's heresy to say so, but the Alps rather
remind me of wedding-cake."</p>

<p>And all the time and all the way down as they descended
he was thinking of something else&mdash;of gilded salons
and baroque antechambers, of consulates and embassies and
chancelleries, of faded uniforms and tarnished orders, of
intrigues and plottings and counter-plottings, of Paris
cafés where Russian <i>émigrés</i> passed their days on a
treadmill of futile anticipation, of Riviera hotels where
the very waiters were princes and expected extra tips for
so being, of dark and secret assassinations, of frontiers
stiff with bayonets, of men in Moscow council-rooms
ruthless, logical, and aware. That madly spinning world lay
so close, and it was in his power to thrust her into the
very vortex of it.</p>

<p>That night he took out of a sealed envelope certain
curiously-marked papers. They were twelve years old; time
and a fumigating oven had considerably faded them. He
looked them through and then replaced them in the envelope.
It was late, past midnight; the sailors had returned to
their ship; even the Roones had gone to bed, and the lamps
in the corridor were all out. He groped his way downstairs
and found the drawing-room. There were the remains of
a fire just faintly red in the grate; he knelt on the
hearth-rug and fanned the embers till they glowed into
flame. Then he placed the envelope on the top and watched
it burn with all its contents. He waited till the last
inch was turned to ashes and he could break and scatter
them with the poker. Then he went back to his room and to
bed.</p>

<p>But he did not sleep too well. If one problem had been
settled, another remained; if he had not traced her in
order to tell her who she was, why had he traced her at
all? What need was there to stay at Roone's any longer? And
so, bewitching and insidious, came again the memory of the
past; she was a shadow, an echo, reminding him that he was
still young, and that the Harley Street man might have made
a mistake. And the idea came to him that he might tell her
some day, not about her own identity, which did not matter,
but about himself and Daly.</p>

<p>The next morning began a chaotic interlude of travel;
he wired to his London lawyer and the two arranged a
half-way meeting at the railway hotel at Fishguard. The
dignified elderly solicitor, obviously flustered by such
hectic arrangements, scratched away for an hour in a
private sitting-room; then Fothergill signed; and two hotel
servants acted as witnesses and were suitably rewarded. The
lawyer saw his client off on the Rosslare boat and parted
from him full of misgivings. "It is not for me to offer
criticism, Mr. Fothergill," he said, accepting a drink in
the saloon before the gangways were lowered, "but I do hope
you have given all this your most careful consideration."
Fothergill assured him that he had, and added: "Anyhow,
I hope I'm not going to die just yet&mdash;it's only a
precaution." To which the lawyer replied: "I must say I
think you're looking very much better than when I saw you
in London," and Fothergill answered: "My dear chap, I
really don't think I ever felt better in my life. It's the
Irish climate&mdash;it seems to suit me."</p>

<p>He was at Roone's again by the afternoon of the next
day, with Mrs. Consett immensely curious about his
lightning dash to England. "Business," he told her, and she
was satisfactorily impressed; her idea of the successful
business man was perfectly in accord with such fantastic
journeys on mysterious errands.</p>

<p>Back at Roone's he yielded again to the spell of magic
possibility. Could he tell her about their earlier meeting
when she was but a child; could he thus make fast to
his own life this new and charming fragrance that might
otherwise fade away?</p>

<p>So he perplexed himself, but that Saturday night as he
saw her talking to a young naval sub-lieutenant he came to
sudden decision. He saw her smiling at the pink-checked and
handsome boy; he heard their laughter together; then they
danced, and all at once, as he watched them, he felt old
again and knew that he was old; and when Mrs. Consett began
her usual chatter, he felt: We are a couple of old folks,
watching the youngsters amuse themselves... </p>

<p>But half an hour later she came up to him, having left
her partner, and said: "Don't you want to dance tonight,
Mr. Fothergill? I suppose you're tired after the journey?"
And he was up in a moment, ready to whirl through the world
with her, old or young.</p>

<p>She said, as they danced: "That was a nice boy, if he
wasn't so silly."</p>

<p>"I thought he looked a very attractive young fellow."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but silly. I suppose most girls like it and
I'm the exception. I never could get on very well with boys
of that age."</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> age, indeed? I wouldn't be surprised if he's
half a dozen years older than you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know&mdash;it's strange, isn't it? Perhaps the
silliness is in me, after all."</p>

<p>"In you?"</p>

<p>"Why not? Probably I'm old for my years. I've a sort of
theory that I aged a good deal before I was six and that
now I'm anything between thirty and forty."</p>

<p>"That would put you nearer me."</p>

<p>"Yes, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>Her calm, friendly eyes were looking up at him, and he
had to exert every atom of will-power to prevent himself
from yielding to the call of so rich a memory. His brain
reeled and eddied; he began to speak, but found his voice
so grotesque and uncertain that he broke off and tried
to fix himself into some kind of temporary coherence; he
heard her saying: "I don't think you're dancing very well
to-night&mdash;you look as if your mind's on something else
all the time."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, it just is."</p>

<p>"Shall we stop, then? <i>I</i> don't mind. Perhaps you feel
tired?"</p>

<p>"I never felt less tired in my life. What I'd just like
now is to go out and climb the Baragh."</p>

<p>"Really? Do you mean it&mdash;really?"</p>

<p>He hadn't at first, but he did then, suddenly. "Yes," he
said.</p>

<p>"Well, we could, couldn't we? It's bright moonlight and
we know the way. It's quite early&mdash;we should be back
before the others begin clearing off to bed. I love doing
odd things that most people would think quite mad."</p>

<p>They slipped out through the verandah and began, hatless
and coatless, the steep scramble through the woods,
drenched with dew, and then up the rough, boulder-strewn
boreen to the summit. They climbed too swiftly and
breathlessly for speech, and all the way he was dizzily
making up his mind for all the things he would say when
they reached the topmost ridge. He imagined himself telling
her: "Dear child, you are all that means anything in my
life, and I want to tell you how and why&mdash;I want
you to know how I missed my way in life, over and over
again, yet found in the end something that was worth it
all. You see, I want us always to be friends&mdash;great
friends&mdash;you and I, not just as if we were chance
travellers and had taken to each other. Much more than
that. And it's all so strange that I want you to try
to understand." And other confessions equally wild and
enchanting. But when lie stood finally on that moonlit
peak, with the sky a blue-black sea all around him, he
could not think of anything to say at all. She stood so
still and close to him, thrilling with rapture at the view,
pointing down excitedly to the tiny winking lights of the
cruiser, and then swinging round to peer into the silver
dimness of the valley on the other side. "I shall never,
never forget this as long as I live," she whispered. "It's
far more wonderful than in the day-time when we climbed
before."</p>

<p>Then suddenly he realised why, or perhaps one reason
why, he was not speaking. He was in pain. He felt as if
a bar of white-hot steel were bending round his body and
being tightened. Yet he hardly felt the pain, even though
he knew it was there; it was as if the moonlight and the
thoughts that swam in his mind were anaesthetising him.
He opened his mouth and tried to speak, but could only
hear himself gasping; and lie felt, beyond the knowledge
of pain, an impotent fury with his body for spoiling such
a moment. He smiled a twisted smile; he had been too
venturesome, too defiant; he had climbed too fast. And all
at once, just then, the thought came to him: Supposing I
were to drop dead, up here&mdash;poor child, what a shock
it would be for her, and what a lot of damned unpleasant
fuss for her afterward... </p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> tired," she said, staring at him intently.
"Shall we go down?"</p>

<p>He nodded slowly and hoped she did not see the tears
that were filling his eyes.</p>

<p>They began the descent, and after a few yards she took
his arm and helped him over the rough places. Half-way down
he felt better; the pain was beginning to leave him. "I'm
sorry," he said.</p>

<p>"Sorry? For what? I enjoyed it ever so much, but it
tired you, I could see&mdash;we mustn't do such mad things
again."</p>

<p>"Except that I like mace things just as much as you
do."</p>

<p>She smiled, and he smiled back, and with her arm still
linked in his he felt a marvellous happiness enveloping
him, especially now that the pain was subsiding with every
second.</p>

<p>"I'm not so bad for my age," he added. "I suppose I
oughtn't to expect to be able to skip up and down mountains
like an eighteen-year-old."</p>

<p>"Your age?" she said quietly. "I never think of it, or
of mine either. What does it matter?"</p>

<p>He laughed, then; he was so happy; and now that the pain
had all gone he could believe it had been no more than a
fit of breathlessness after the climb&mdash;a warning, no
doubt, that he must avoid such strenuous risks in future.
His only big regret was that he had missed the chance
of telling her what had been in his mind, but it was
too late now&mdash;the lights of the hotel were already
glimmering through the trees. As they entered along the
verandah he said: "I really <i>am</i> sorry for being such an
old crock&mdash;sorry on my own account, anyway, because
I'd rather wanted to have a particular talk with you about
something."</p>

<p>"Had you? And you'd stage-managed it for the top of a
mountain in moonlight&mdash;how thrilling! But it will do
somewhere else, surely?"</p>

<p>He laughed. "Of course. The question is when rather than
where."</p>

<p>"Why not to-morrow morning? We could go out on the
harbour in the motor-boat&mdash;mother wouldn't come with
us&mdash;she hates sailing."</p>

<p>"Good idea. That'll do fine."</p>

<p>"Directly after Mass, then. I think they'll be having it
in the hotel to-morrow&mdash;I heard Roone saying something
about it. That'll save the walk down to the village and we
can have a longer time on the water."</p>

<p>"Splendid."</p>

<p>"And I'm so thrilled to wonder what you have to tell
me."</p>

<p>"<i>Are</i> you?" He looked at her with piercing eagerness;
yet he could not, <i>could</i> not read what was in her mind.</p>

<p>But later, after she had said good-night and gone to
bed, his mood of perplexity changed. Beyond a certain
natural fatigue he felt himself no worse for the mountain
adventure, but to brace himself after the strain he did
what he had not often done at Roone's&mdash;he went into
the bar for a night-cap. The Roones were there with a few
naval men and a fishing youth in plus-fours; they tried
to get him into conversation, but he said little and
stayed only for a few minutes. The fact was, he could not
even think of anything but the talk he would have on the
morrow.</p>

<p>Then he took his candle (Roone's was old-fashioned
enough for that) and went to his room on the first floor.
He would get up early, he decided, and go to Mass&mdash;his
first for so long&mdash;too long. He saw the moon and the
clear sky through the window, promising another fine day.
He saw the cruiser's masthead light shimmering softly over
the harbour. He undressed and got into bed and closed
his eyes&mdash;the whisky had made him drowsy&mdash;and
suddenly, falling asleep, he felt most magnificently and
boyishly certain of everything, and especially that he had
loved, in all the possible ways of love.</p>
