<p class="first">THOMAS BENTLEY SCUDDER, of Mark's tenements in
Lisson Grove, was a most unpleasant man to live with, and so his
wife and two children found. He was a dreadful tyrant.</p>

<p>He would not, however, have appeared to the world to be so
unpleasant, as he never drank or gambled and he took no undue
interest in the other sex. He was particular, too, never to use
his fist upon any member of his family, although, occasionally he
was not averse to striking them with the palm of his open hand.
Also, he often shook his little son of eight, who was partly
crippled, so furiously that the local doctor said, once, the lad
was almost in the way of becoming an imbecile through fright, and
threatened to acquaint the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to
Children about it.</p>

<p>A kink must somehow have developed in Scudder's brain, for he
had grown to detest his family in a blind, unreasonable way. He
was always in a bad temper with them, always nagging and forever
declaring what he would do for them all when he could not stand
them any more.</p>

<p>His home-coming at night, he worked as a porter in a Ludgate
Hill warehouse, was always a great trial to them, and the little
boy would shake and shiver whenever he heard his father's
footsteps outside the door of their flat.</p>

<p>Scudder himself was big and truculent looking, but his wife
was gentle and mouse-like in appearance. She never answered him
back, and did her utmost not to anger him, and it was only when
he laid hands upon the children that her temper was roused. Then,
one day, she attempted to strike him with the poker, and when he
threatened he would have her put in prison for it, she was
terrified at the thought of what would become then of the
children.</p>

<p>Scudder had not always been so ill-tempered, but one day he
had been struck on the head by a falling packing case and he had
never been the same man since. Physically, however, he appeared
in excellent health for he was ruddy-faced and stout, in great
contrast to his family, who, all of them, always looked pinched
and white.</p>

<p>He stinted the household, terribly, in the money he allowed
for food, always complaining that they were living beyond their
means. He rarely allowed his wife or children any new clothes,
and in consequence they were more shabbily dressed than anyone
else in the building. They were never given any money for
amusements, and the sole pleasure of the little boy was
collecting buttons.</p>

<p>Everyone in the tenement knew of the sad home life of the
Scudders, for the father had a strident voice and was heard to
shout in anger almost every night.</p>

<p>This state of affairs went on for a long time, and then one
morning, following upon an evening when Scudder had shaken his
little boy until the latter's teeth had seemed to rattle like
castanets, Scudder, who slept in a room by himself, did not come
out at the usual hour of seven o'clock. His wife said later that
she had got his breakfast all ready at the usual time, but she
had not dared to knock at his door until fully a quarter of an
hour had elapsed.</p>

<p>Then receiving no answer either to her knocks or her calling,
she had opened the door and gone into the room to find her
husband unconscious in the bed, as cold as ice, and with his face
a dreadful color.</p>

<p>She had then immediately run out and asked her neighbor in the
adjoining flat, upon the same floor, to come in and look at
Scudder. Thereupon, this neighbor, an elderly woman of sound
common sense, had at once given it as her opinion that it looked
as if Scudder were dying, and she had raced down to the basement
and got the caretaker to telephone for a doctor.</p>

<p>The doctor arrived within a few minutes and said immediately
that it was quite apparent to him Scudder had taken poison. An
ambulance was summoned and Scudder was rushed to a hospital.
There, his stomach was pumped out; he was given injections,
oxygen and artificial respiration, but everything was of no avail
and Thomas Bentley Scudder passed to his Maker within three hours
of admission.</p>

<p>Just a week later, Detective-Inspector Stone of the Criminal
Investigation Department of Scotland Yard was walking
meditatively down Fleet street, when he almost collided with his
friend, Gilbert Larose, a one-time international detective, but
now married to a wealthy widow, who, previous to her marriage
with him had been Lady Helen Ardane.</p>

<p>The stout inspector's face broke instantly into a delighted
smile. "Hullo! Gilbert, my boy," he exclaimed, "but you're the
very chap I want! I was thinking of you not two minutes ago."</p>

<p>"What's up, then, Charlie?" asked Larose, smiling back. "Have
you done in your mother-in-law and want me to arrange an alibi
for you?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, Gilbert," smiled Stone. "My mother-in-law happens to
be a good sort." His face became serious. "But, I say, have you
read about that poisoning case in Lisson Grove?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "No, I've been very busy lately, and
have only just glanced at the newspapers. What's happened
there?"</p>

<p>"Where can I have a bit of a talk with you?" asked Stone,
ignoring his question. He nodded. "I'll tell you a nice little
story that'll just please your rotten, morbid mind."</p>

<p>"Then come to my hotel," said Larose. "I'm putting up at the
Apollo for a few days."</p>

<p>They hailed a taxi and in a very few minutes were sitting
close together in a quiet part of the big Apollo lounge.</p>

<p>"Now, my boy," began Stone, regarding the alert and good-looking face of the young fellow beside him very gravely, "this
is no tale of a sparkling crime among the nobs. It's a very
squalid story of a murder among poor people in a working-class
tenement in Lisson Grove." He shook his head vexatiously. "A wife
has poisoned her husband and we can't bring it home to her."</p>

<p>Then very briefly he proceeded to relate all about the
Scudders; how miserable their home-life had been; how Scudder had
bullied his family; how one night he had particularly ill-treated
his little boy and how the next morning he had been found
unconscious in his bed, and how he had died in the hospital soon
afterwards. Then he proceeded to tell how the post-mortem had
revealed that the man had been poisoned, no less than 112 grains
of veronal being found in the liver and other organs.</p>

<p>"And we are certain it was the wife who gave him the poison,"
went on the inspector. "She had every provocation, it was proved
the veronal must have been administered about the time he had his
meal that evening, she had prepared everything he ate and he had
not set foot out of the building after his meal." He snapped his
fingers together. "But for the life of us we cannot find out how
she got hold of the stuff."</p>

<p>"But veronal!" exclaimed Larose. "Surely a drug like that
would be most difficult for a woman in her position to get
possession of!"</p>

<p>"Impossible, one would say," insisted the inspector, "for
veronal is on the list of prohibited drugs and can be obtained by
no one without a doctor's prescription." He scoffed. "Besides,
what doctor is going to put 150 grains of veronal in any
patient's hands, for that, they reckon, is the probable dose the
man had taken, seeing that more than a hundred grains were
recovered afterwards from the body."</p>

<p>"Of course, she denies it!" suggested Larose.</p>

<p>"Of course, she does," snapped the inspector, "and every time
we try to bring it home to her we come bang up against that
snag&mdash;how did a woman in her station of life manage to get
hold of the poison. That beats us every time. Oh, but we are
suspicious of her!" He nodded emphatically. "It was like this. At
the hospital they knew straight away that the man had been
poisoned, and, the police having had the tip, two local plain-clothes men went up at once to question his wife and try to find
out what stuff he had taken. Of course, she pretended to know
nothing, but to her obvious confusion they said they must search
the dead man's room. They didn't find a scrap of poison, but saw
they had interrupted her when she had been trying to open a large
wooden box with a poker. It turned out to be the box in which
Scudder kept all his private papers, which he didn't want his
wife to see."</p>

<p>The inspector scowled. "Yes, the woman had been going through
her husband's effects before even she knew he was dead, and we
are certain that, from her fear of him and the life he led her,
she would never have dared to touch a single thing of his if she
had been thinking there was any likelihood of his coming
back."</p>

<p>"But why was she opening the box with the poker?" asked
Larose. "Didn't she find his keys in his pockets?"</p>

<p>"No, for the very good reason he put them in his boots at
night. He never trusted his wife, and she had no idea he kept
them there. Our men found them, wrapped in a piece of paper in
one of the toes. I tell you she knew so little of her husband's
affairs that she was not aware that he'd got an account at the
Savings Bank, and that there was £427 10/ in it. The book was in
the box she had been trying to open."</p>

<p>Larose whistled. "Whew, a nice little windfall for someone!
Did he leave any will?"</p>

<p>The inspector grinned. "Yes, he did, and it was in the box,
too, between the leaves of an old photographic album. Perhaps,
Scudder had forgotten all about it, as he'd made it the day after
his wedding, fifteen years ago. He left everything 'to my wife,
Rhoda Scudder, formerly Rhoda Angelstone.'"</p>

<p>The inspector went on. "Now another thing, and this is very
suspicious." He spoke very slowly. "Mrs. Scudder was quite sure
that that morning her husband would not be in a condition to eat
any breakfast, and she did not get everything prepared for him in
the usual way. She says she made a pot of tea for him, boiled him
an egg and fried him his usual three rashers of bacon. That all
came out in the questions that were put to her at the inquest,
but"&mdash;he nodded significantly&mdash;"the neighbor who was
called in when Scudder was found unconscious says there was no
smell of bacon when she came into the kitchen and as she sat
there, as company for Mrs. Scudder until the doctor arrived, she
is positive there was no frying pan upon the stove and the stove
itself was stone cold. Her chair was close against it." He
nodded. "So Mrs. Scudder was lying then again&mdash;a small lie,
but a very significant one."</p>

<p>"And you asked what became of the bacon?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Certainly, and the reply was that she ate two of the rashers
herself and gave one to the little boy. Most improbable, because
she is very highly strung, and just the type of individual who
would be unable to touch food after any mental upset."</p>

<p>"What was the woman like in the witness box?"</p>

<p>"Very cool and collected and very much all there. She was well
prepared by then with her answers, and able to reel off at once
every article of food that her husband had had for his tea, three
sausages, bread and butter, a piece of cold suet pudding and a
cup of coffee with three spoonfuls of sugar. That was all the man
had touched and she said she heard him throw himself upon his bed
within half an hour of having finished his meal."</p>

<p>"And you haven't the slightest idea of how the veronal had
been obtained?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest. We made enquiries for miles and miles
round if any had been missed or lost and could hear nothing." The
inspector spread out his hands. "And we know the woman hadn't
left the house for more than three weeks, as she had had a bad
cold and that neighbor in the adjoining flat had done all the
shopping for her. Also, we cannot learn that she had had a single
visitor during that time. They're a nosey lot in the tenement and
it is almost certain a strange person would have been noticed
coming up the stairs."</p>

<p>"And the inquest is concluded now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it had been adjourned until today and this morning the
verdict was 'Death from an overdose of veronal, but by whom
administered is unknown.'" Stone smiled sardonically. "Now,
Gilbert this should be a very simple problem for you." He
grinned. "Where did she get the veronal?"</p>

<p>A long silence followed and then Larose said with a
smile:&mdash;"I should like to see this woman. She seems
interesting to me."</p>

<p>"She is interesting," replied Stone sharply, ''and I've never
quite met her like before. I've been questioning her every
blessed day, and each time I've seen her she's appeared to be of
strong character. She's not a bit nervous now, and at the inquest
this morning she was as cool and self-possessed as she could
possibly be. She just denied everything, and I could see she made
an excellent impression upon the jury. Oh! as for seeing her, why
not come straightaway now. In any case, I'm calling tonight to
make her understand she is not to leave the tenement without
letting us know where she is moving.''</p>

<p>So it happened that some twenty minutes later a taxi dropped
the two at Mark's Tenements. They passed two men as they were
entering the building, and Stone nodded to one. "The caretaker,"
he explained, as they were mounting the stairs, "and he gave
Scudder a dreadful character." He gripped Larose by the arm. "If
homicide were not a punishable offence, Gilbert, some might say
this woman has done a good deed." He nodded. The crippled lad,
already, looks a different boy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Scudder received them with quiet dignity, and even smiled
at Inspector Stone, as if he were an old friend. Larose was not
introduced, and he asked no questions, contenting himself with
first regarding the woman very intently, and then letting his
eyes roam round upon every article in the room.</p>

<p>"And are you going to any relations?" asked the inspector,
when Mrs. Scudder had told them she was leaving the tenement as
soon as she could arrange it.</p>

<p>"I have no relations," she replied sharply, "and I have no
friends, either. Mr. Scudder never liked me to make any. No, I'm
going somewhere into the country. I shall find a little place
where I can keep poultry and make teas for cyclists." She gave
the ghost of a little smile. "I'll tell you where I am going
directly I know myself."</p>

<p>They stayed only a very few minutes and then when bowling
along in another taxi, Stone asked with a deep sigh, "Well,
Gilbert, what's your opinion?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "Guilty, without a shadow of doubt," he replied
solemnly. "She is worn out with all she's been through, but every
moment, just now, there was suppressed triumph on her tired face.
She knows she's beaten you." He sighed in his turn. "But still,
she's rather a nice type of woman, Charlie, although probably her
conscience is not troubling her in the slightest. It was to save
that lad that she turned at last upon her husband, and it was
like the wrath of a sheep." He nodded again. "Still, with you I
feel rather sorry for her."</p>

<p>"But I'm not allowing myself to feel sorry," growled Stone,
"for I never indulge in sympathy with the criminal classes. My
job is to help carry out the administration of the law and I want
to get that woman twenty years." He spoke sharply. "But are you
going to be any good to me, Gilbert?" He grinned sarcastically.
"Found out anything by this visit just now?"</p>

<p>Larose grinned back. "Yes, quite a lot. I'll come and see you
in about a couple of days."</p>

<p>The inspector looked contemptuous.</p>

<p>But it was not destined that Larose should have any news for
Inspector Stone in anything like a couple of days, for the next
morning he was in the throes of a severe attack of influenza, and
it was more than three weeks before he began to feel really
himself again.</p>

<p>The inspector called several times to see how he was getting
on, announcing upon the last occasion that nothing more had been
found out about Mrs. Scudder, and that she had now moved to a
cottage just outside the little town of Westerham, in Kent. The
cottage had a good-sized garden and she was having a summer-house
put up, with the notice upon a board that teas were provided at
nine-pence a head."</p>

<p>"I ran down on Sunday to make sure she was there," added the
inspector, "and she didn't turn a hair when she saw me get out of
the car, although for all she knew I might have had the warrant
in my pocket. She even wanted to press a little box of eggs upon
me"&mdash;he shook his head ironically&mdash;"but I wasn't to be
bribed that way." He smiled a big, expansive smile. "But come
now, hurry up, my boy, and get to work, for the scent is getting
cold. In her country surroundings she doesn't look a bit like a
poisoner."</p>

<p>When finally Larose was able to get about again, he was very
busy for three days. Then on the fourth day he rang up Scotland
Yard, to find, however, that Inspector Stone was in the North of
England and would not be back for two days, until the Monday. So
as he was intending to leave for his home in Norfolk early on the
Monday morning, he sat down just before dinner on the Saturday
evening and wrote him a letter.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My Dear
Charlie</span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">As you anticipated, once I got to work it was a
very simple matter for me to find out from where Mrs. Scudder got
the veronal. Her brother, Luke Angelstone, gave it to her. His
address is 24, Doughty street, Theobald's road. He is a postman
and he kept back five 'physicians' samples' of Vomeral which he
ought to have delivered at the houses of five doctors in
Marylebone road, on Thursday, May the eighth, just over seven
weeks ago. The names of the doctors are Patson, Maddling, Boyle,
Cooper and James. Vomeral is sodium barbitone, or veronal, and is
very soluble in water. The sample packets of the Vomeral,
contained five tablets of seven and a half grains in each tablet,
therefore he filched rather more than 177 grains altogether.</p>

<p class="letter">I found it out in this way. When we called upon
Mrs. Scudder that afternoon, you remember we passed the caretaker
of Mark's Tenements, and then another man, coming out of the
building. This other man, I saw, was wearing postman's trousers.
They both stared hard at us and I stared hard at them. Then when
we went upstairs to Mrs. Scudder I noticed that her eyes were of
the same color and shape as those of this second man we had just
passed, and seeing two dirty teacups upon the dresser I guessed
she had just had a visitor. The smell of tea was still hanging
about the room. Then I argued the man with the same eyes had in
all probability been her visitor and that he was some relation of
hers, most likely her brother.</p>

<p class="letter">Then when she was so prompt in declaring to you
that she had no relations and was so emphatic about it, I was of
opinion at once that she had some very definite reason for not
wanting you to know she had a relation who was a postman.</p>

<p class="letter">Then it flashed into my mind that a postman
would, of course, often be handling drugs that were being
delivered at the houses of medical men.</p>

<p class="letter">Now you had mentioned to me that Mrs Scudder's
maiden name had been Angelstone, and searching the London
Directory, I saw a Mrs. Angelstone, the only person of that name
in the directory, kept a sweetshop in Doughty street. Then, from
indirect enquiries I learnt that her husband was a postman.</p>

<p class="letter">Well, the following morning when he was
delivering letters, I shadowed this postman and noted down the
names of all the medical men who were on his round.</p>

<p class="letter">Next, I approached a doctor friend and enquired
of him where the profession generally purchased their veronal. He
mentioned the name of several firms and then added that Heiner
&amp; Co., of Gray's Inn road had but recently put upon the
market a palatable and very soluble veronal in the form of
tablets, under the designation of Vomeral and in common with all
other medical men, he had received a sample from them about two
months ago.</p>

<p class="letter">I pricked up my ears there and then getting an
introduction to Heiner &amp; Co. through a very influential
person, prevailed upon them to let me act as their traveller for
one day. Then I called upon all the doctors on Angelstone's round
and, extolling the advantages of Vomeral, discovered that five of
them had no recollection of having received any samples of the
preparation, as they should have done those two months ago. Heigh
presto! I feel sorry for both Mrs. Scudder and the postman.
Scudder was an unpleasant ogre in his little world and, knowing
all he had done, nine people out of ten would be inclined to hold
to the view that he only got his deserts, or indeed much less
than his deserts, forasmuch as his departure from this life was a
perfectly painless one.</p>

<p class="letter">I regret deeply that my curiosity induced me to
start upon any enquiries, and that my vanity now urges me to make
known to you their result.</p>

<p class="letter">Sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Gilbert Larose</span>.</p>

<p class="letter">P.S.&mdash;This postman seems to be a warm-hearted, simple fellow. He is happily married, has three
children, and to all accounts is a good husband and father.</p>

<br>

<p>"And this letter," sighed Larose, "will ruin two families and
reverberate down the lifetime of them all." He frowned. "Now if I
don't post it at once, I shall weaken and perhaps not post it at
all." He opened the door of his room. "So here goes, I'll post it
with no further consideration."</p>

<p>But he did not post it at once, for after hesitating before
the pillar box in the lounge of the hotel, he went into dinner
with the letter still in his pocket.</p>

<p>His face was a frowning one right through the meal and then
finally, at dessert, he came to the sudden resolution. "No, damn
it all, I'll go down and see the woman, first, and hear what
she's got to say."</p>

<p>So the following afternoon he drove down to Westerham, and
leaving his car in a garage there, walked on to where he was told
Mrs. Scudder lived. Reaching the cottage, he saw a small boy
swinging on the garden gate.</p>

<p>"Hullo! sonny," he exclaimed, "is this Mrs. Scudder's
place?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the boy, "she's my mum."</p>

<p>"Oh! then I want to speak to her," said Larose.</p>

<p>"She's out for a few minutes," explained the boy, "but she'll
be back before long." His face became animated and eager. "But if
you want a tea, Sis can give it you without waiting for mum. It's
only nine-pence and you get bread-and-butter and watercress and
two kinds of jam. We serve it in that summer-house there. We've
just had it made."</p>

<p>Not wanting to wait outside and attract attention, Larose
followed the boy into the summer-house, where the pretty and
neatly dressed sister very speedily put a tea upon the table. She
was most anxious to see that her customer had everything he
wanted, and her little brother hovered round all the time, ready
to supplement her activities, if necessary.</p>

<p>"You can have more bread-and-butter if you want it," he
announced importantly, "and you give Sis the money when you've
finished."</p>

<p>Larose sipped his cup of tea very thoughtfully, and frowningly
made himself a sandwich of the bread and butter and cress.
Apparently not many teas had been served as yet, for the girl was
palpably nervous and unaccustomed to the work.</p>

<p>"You will be able to have cream, sir," she said shyly, after a
few minutes, "if you come again next week. We're going to buy a
cow and mother's gone to see about it now."</p>

<p>"Do you do much business?" asked Larose, amused at the
attention he was receiving.</p>

<p>"We've only been here a very little while, sir, but we served
nine teas yesterday," replied the girl proudly, "and when we get
known we shall do many more than that. Everything is going to be
so clean."</p>

<p>"And I'm going to help milk the cow," said the boy, with the
confiding nature of a child. "The gentleman we're buying it from
is going to teach me."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the gate clicked and Larose saw Mrs.
Scudder coming up the path. The boy ran up and spoke to her and
she came at once to the summer-house.</p>

<p>"You want to speak to me, sir?" she asked of Larose, and it
was evident from her demeanor that she had no recollection of
having seen him before.</p>

<p>Larose regarded her critically. She was dressed very quietly,
in a black dress and was wearing an old-fashioned black toque
that, strangely enough, gave her something of the appearance of a
nun. But it was her face that so intrigued him, for upon it was
engraved a gentle and sad serenity. It was the face of a woman
who had been through suffering, but was enjoying
peace&mdash;peace, perfect peace.</p>

<p>He drew in a deep breath. "I only wanted to know," he said
lamely "if you could let me have a shilling's worth of eggs." He
smiled. "I've heard yours are always fresh."</p>

<p><br>
THE following morning Inspector Stone was sitting in his room
in Scotland Yard when a brother inspector entered.</p>

<p>"I say, Charlie," said the latter, "when I was going by, on
the top of a bus, on Friday, I saw Gilbert Larose in Marylebone
road. He was dressed very differently to the way he usually is
now, and was carrying a bag. Just when I caught sight of him he
was standing still and glancing at a small piece of paper he'd
got in his hand. He looked to me the very spit of a commercial
traveller calling on his customers."</p>

<p>"A-ah! Ah!" exclaimed Stone smilingly, "then I shall be
hearing from him very soon. He's doing a little job for me."</p>

<p>And hear from him very quickly the stout inspector did, for
not ten minutes later a letter and cardboard box were delivered
by hand.</p>

<p>Stone opened the letter eagerly, and read.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Charlie</span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">As you anticipated, I did succeed in making a few discoveries,
but as a private individual I shall not interfere. I believe
Justice to be best served by letting things remain as they
are.</p>

<p class="letter">Kind regards always,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Gilbert Larose</span>.</p>

<p class="letter">P.S.&mdash;Remember, Scudder's death was a perfectly painless
one.</p>

<br>


<p>"Justice!" snorted the inspector disgustedly. "Who spoke of
Justice, at all? It's law that concerns us, not Justice, any
time." He shook his head angrily. "Gilbert never lies, and so
he's found out something, right enough, but now he's not going to
tell." He frowned. "He was always too much of a sentimentalist to
be a good officer, and I was always telling him so." His eyes
fell upon the cardboard box and, lifting it up, he rattled it
gently. "Eggs! Mrs. Scudder's eggs!" He recovered his good humor
and his face broke into an amused smile. "The young devil! These
are just to inform me he's been down to see her." He shook his
head again, but now in mock severity. "Ah! he's not like me. He
took these eggs as a bribe to hold his tongue!"</p>
