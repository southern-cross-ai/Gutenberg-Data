<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>It is unnecessary to enter into any lengthened exposition of the
objects and utility of a work such as the present, either from an
English or an Australasian point of view. The public appetite for
such publications is evidenced by the issue of innumerable
"Biographical Dictionaries" and the success of such a work as the
"National Dictionary of Biography," and there seems no valid reason
why what Sir Thomas McIlwraith calls "the future Australasian
empire" should not have the careers of its publicists in various
walks of distinction recorded in permanent and concise form. Owing
to the increase of federal feeling in the various colonies, the
present moment seems an opportune one for the presentation of a
work which "federalises," so to speak, the mass of what previous
writers have produced in a similar direction in regard to the
separate colonies. I have often had occasion to remark on the
limited knowledge which the public men of one colony possess of the
public men of another, and in a period which has produced the
"Commonwealth of Australasia Bill" I may perhaps be excused for
endeavouring to contribute my mite towards the extension of that
intercommunity of knowledge which is to a large extent the
necessary condition precedent to intercommunity of sympathy and
action.</p>

<p>Not only has the federal feeling in Australasia witnessed a
wonderful growth of recent years, but the interest in and desire
for knowledge about the Australasian colonies has been quickened to
at least an equal extent at the centre of the empire. It is hoped
therefore that the "Dictionary of Australasian Biography" may at
the present juncture equally meet the acceptance of large classes
both in England and at the Antipodes. It has been one of the most
difficult parts of an arduous task to combine that particularity
which local biography for local circulation demands with that more
comprehensive, if at the same time more condensed, treatment which
is likely to suit the taste of readers twelve thousand miles away
from the stage on which the actors whose achievements are set forth
have played their parts. In the attempt to furnish a book which
will be equally satisfactory to English and colonial readers, I
cannot hope to have entirely succeeded; but I have at least kept
this object in view, and am sanguine enough to believe that I have
fulfilled my aim in so far as the contrarieties of the case will
permit.</p>

<p>As to the scope of the work, it records the careers of the
majority of the eminent Australasian colonists who survived to see
the inauguration of responsible government in 1855, and who have
died in the interval of thirty-seven years which has elapsed since
that epoch-making era. It also includes the biographies of living
persons, and thus contains the class of information which is to be
found in the usual run of biographical dictionaries regarding
deceased worthies, in addition to the more recent data respecting
living persons which are afforded by such publications as the
English "Men of the Time." The extent of the information presented
will be best gathered when I state that the "Dictionary" comprises
nearly two thousand biographies, including those of the governors
of the several colonies, the prelates of the Anglican and Roman
Catholic communions, the heads of the principal religious
denominations and of the several universities, as well as notices
of all politicians, with a few unavoidable exceptions, who have
held Ministerial office in the Australian colonies, New Zealand,
and Tasmania since the year 1855. The principal members of the
Civil Service and the explorers, authors, scientists, musicians,
and actors who have won distinction in the colonial arena have been
dealt with as adequately as circumstances permitted; and the work
also includes lives of a number of the pastoral, mercantile, and
industrial pioneers of the various colonies, as well as of those
who have distinguished themselves in the domain of sport and
athleticism.</p>

<p>There are one or two special points to which I should like to
draw attention. In the first place, the titles of honour and office
given to the several subjects of biography are those which they are
entitled to bear in their respective colonies, though, by a strange
anomaly in the constitutional formularies of a country which will
mainly go down to history in connection with the glories of its
colonial empire, the most commonly borne title in the
last-mentioned portion of her Majesty's dominions&mdash;that of
"Honourable" &mdash; is not conceded recognition outside of the
colony in which the public services of which it is the reward have
been rendered. If therefore the present work should do anything to
"imperialise"&mdash;if I may use the word&mdash;a title to which
there is really no valid democratic objection, and to promote its
recognition and that of the good service which it typifies in every
part of the empire, I shall take pride in having contributed even
in this humble way to the disappearance of the last vestige of that
hateful doctrine of colonial inferiority which comes to us from the
dark, but unfortunately not yet very distant, ages of Colonial
Office ineptitude and insular presumption.</p>

<p>With regard to the incidence of this title of "Honourable," some
confusion may arise in the minds of English, and even Australasian
readers. Broadly speaking, the Australasian public man is entitled
to bear the title of "Honourable" within his own colony during his
actual tenure of office as a member of the Upper House or as a
member of the Ministry of the day in such colony. In all the
Australasian colonies members of the Ministry are members for the
time being of the Executive Council, which corresponds somewhat to
the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, and it is to their
membership of this body that they owe the title of "Honourable,"
which they cannot assume until they have been sworn into its
privileged precincts. In all these colonies, except Victoria and
Tasmania, the members of a retiring Ministry cease to be members of
the Executive Council, and would thus lose the title of
"Honourable" were it not that, under the Duke of Newcastle's
despatch dealing with the case, any member of the Executive Council
who has served as a member of the Government either consecutively
or cumulatively for three years may by royal warrant be permitted
to retain the title of "Honourable" within his particular colony
for the term of his life. In Victoria and, it would also seem, in
Tasmania, when once a public man has been sworn a member of the
Executive Council, he remains one for life, and thus retains the
degree of "Honourable" for life also. The Speaker of the Lower
House in each colony assumes the title whilst he occupies the
chair, and it is a moot point whether the judges of the Supreme
Court are not entitled to the distinction, though the preponderance
of local custom gives them (including even the Chief Justice) the
designation of "His Honour" in common with the District and County
Court judiciary.</p>

<p>There may be some confusion, too, in the English mind as to the
designation of members of Parliament in the various Australasian
colonies. Membership of the Upper House in each of the colonies is
signified by the addition of the letters "M.L.C."; but with regard
to the Lower House a good deal of contrariety prevails. In New
South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Western
Australia the Lower House is called the Legislative Assembly, and
except in the case of South Australia the members are styled
"M.L.A." In the case of the latter colony, however, the more
pretentious affix of "M.P." is employed. In this regard there is a
general tendency in all the colonies to give the title of "M.P." to
members of the Lower House, especially where it is desired to be
particularly complimentary; but in South Australia alone does the
designation "M.P." appear to have crystallised into normal official
and social use. In Tasmania the Lower House is called the House of
Assembly, and members are styled "M.H.A." In New Zealand what is
known as the Legislative Assembly in most of the other colonies is
styled the House of Representatives, and the letters "M.H.R." are
appended to the names of members.</p>

<p>It now remains for me to return my grateful thanks to the
various gentlemen but for whose aid, even after eighteen months of
almost continuous labour, it would have been impossible for me to
give my work to the public at so early a date. Here it may be
premised that all occurrences in the present volume have as far as
possible been brought down to July 1892. Mr. J. Henniker Heaton,
M.P., so well known in connection with the universally interesting
question of postal reform, must have the credit of having been the
first to explore in any comprehensive manner the mine of
Australasian biography, in his "Australian Dictionary of Dates and
Men of the Time," published in 1879. "Much," however, "has
happened" during the thirteen years which have elapsed since this
book saw the light, and as regards the biographical portion it is
now completely out of date, except in the case of those "worthies"
whose careers had been closed by death prior to 1879. Even as
regards these, however, their lives are given in the present volume
in almost every instance in an expanded and revised form, the
result of much laborious personal research. In addition to the
valuable aid derived from his "Men of the Time," I am indebted to
Mr. Heaton for a considerable amount of information deduced from
his valuable stores of Australasian data in print and
manuscript.</p>

<p>I have to return my sincere thanks for much assistance afforded
me by the present Agents-General, as well as by their immediate
predecessors, and by the able and courteous Secretaries to their
several offices. In this connection I may especially mention the
late Sir Arthur Blyth, the predecessor of Sir John Bray in the
London representation of South Australia. That gentleman kindly
revised my list of "worthies" of that colony, and covered it with
copious annotations drawn from his long experience of South
Australia and his special aptitude for biographical investigation
and local chronology. As regards Tasmania, Sir E. N. C. Braddon
performed for me much the same services, and in the case of South
Australia and Queensland I am specially indebted to Mr. S. Deering,
the Assistant Agent-General of the former colony, and to Mr. C. S.
Dicken, C.M.G., Secretary to the Agent-General for the latter, both
of whom bring to bear on all matters connected with their several
colonies a very accurate personal knowledge of their history and
circumstances. I am also under considerable obligations to Mr. S.
Yardley, of the New South Wales, Mr. W. Kennaway, C.M.G., of the
New Zealand, and to Mr. S. B. H. Rodgerson, of the Victoria
office.</p>

<p>The most substantial contribution in the way of literary
assistance I have received from Mr. James Backhouse Walker, of
Hobart, whose equally accurate memory and memoranda have enabled
him, as his kindness prompted him, to supply me with a number of
admirably compiled biographies, which add an element of real
historical value to the department of the work which he generously
undertook, and which, in addition to much original matter,
comprised the laborious revision of the biographies of eminent
Tasmanians which I already had in print, when I had the good
fortune to be introduced to him by a member of the eminent firm of
Tasmanian publishers, Messrs. Walch and Co., of Hobart.</p>

<p>Next in order I must acknowledge my obligations to my friends
Mr. A. Patchett Martin and Mr. H. B. Marriott Watson, both of whom
have not only contributed a number of complete lives, but have
greatly aided me in the selection of names and the revision of
proofs. In this connection, as very valuable and substantial
helpers, I must also mention Mr. G. W. Rusden, the distinguished
historian of Australia and New Zealand, who has supplemented the
stores of information which I have derived from his works with much
valuable data personally conveyed; my old friend Mr. A. M. Topp, of
the Melbourne <i>Argus</i>; Mr. Alexander Sutherland, the
well-known Australian <i>littérateur</i>; and Mr. J. F. Hogan,
whose "Irish in Australia" is a mine of biographical detail, and to
whose personal assistance I am also greatly beholden. My South
Australian biographies would have been sadly incomplete but for the
aid I derived from my friend Mr. J. L. Bonython, of the Adelaide
<i>Advertiser</i>, and from Mr. F. Johns, of the <i>South
Australian Register</i>, who, through the medium of the proprietor
of that paper, Mr. R. Kyffin Thomas, kindly cleared up for me a
number of troublesome queries and essential dates. The New Zealand
portion of my work owes a heavy debt to Mr. Leys, of the Auckland
<i>Star</i>, who kindly forwarded a number of biographies and
carefully checked others. Mr. George Fenwick, of the <i>Otago Daily
Times</i>, has also helped me materially; and I have to thank Sir
Walter Buller for a valuable element in the insertion of a number
of Maori biographies. Through Mr. Fenwick I was fortunate enough to
enlist the aid of Dr. Hocken, of Dunedin, an expert and enthusiast
in all that concerns New Zealand history and antiquities, and who
kindly placed his fine library at my disposal. To my wife I owe
thanks for invaluable aid in the work of transcription, and to Mr.
David and Mr. Joseph Cowen Syme, of Melbourne, for much kindly
assistance in promoting the success of the work.</p>

<p>Taking the colonies separately, I have to acknowledge valuable
help as regards New South Wales from Mr. F. W. Ward, the late
editor of the Sydney Daily Telegraph, from Mrs. Ward, and from Mr.
C. A. W. Lett and Mr. Gilbert Parker; Victoria: Hon. J. F. Vesey
Fitzgerald, Hon. Alfred Deakin, Mr. George Syme, Mr. T. S. Townend,
and Mr. Charles Short, of the Melbourne <i>Argus</i>, Mr. Julian
Thomas, and Mr. H. Britton; Queensland: Mr. Buzacott, Mr.
Brentnall, and Mr. Gresley Lukin; Western Australia: Sir John and
Lady Forrest, Sir James G. Lee Steere, Hon. G. W. Leake, M.L.C.,
Hon. J. W. Hackett, M.L.C.,and Mr. F. Hart; New Zealand: Mr. H.
Brett, Mr. W. L. Rees, M.H.R., Rev. H. C. M. Watson, Christchurch;
Mr. T. E. Richardson, Wellington; Mr. Hart, <i>The Press</i>,
Christchurch; and Mr. Ahearne, <i>Lyttelton Times</i>,
Christchurch.</p>

<p>In regard to matter drawn from books, my first acknowledgments
are due to Mr. David Blair's "Encyclopædia of Australasia," of
which a second edition is much called for. I must also mention, as
having supplied me with much excellent material, Mr. George
Rusden's "History of Australia" and "History of New Zealand,"
"Victorian Men of the Time," "Victoria and its Metropolis,"
McCombie's "History of the Colony of Victoria," Mr. James Bonwick's
"Port Phillip Settlement," Mr. George E. Loyau's "Representative
Men of South Australia," Stow's "South Australia," "The Statistical
Register of South Australia," Mr. H. Brett's "Heroes of New
Zealand" and "The Early History of New Zealand," Mr. Gisborne's
"New Zealand Balers and Statesmen," Mr. Alfred Cox's "Men of Mark
of New Zealand" and "Recollections"; the admirable annual
"Blue-books" of the several colonies, which are in every case a
credit to those responsible for their production; Messrs. Gordon
and Gotch's "Australian Handbook" and Mr. Greville's "Year-book of
Australia." Amongst works of a more general character, I must
confess my great indebtedness to "The National Dictionary of
Biography," Mr. F. Boase's "Modern English Biography," to "The
Colonial Office List," Burke's "Peerage, Baronetage, and Knightage"
and "Colonial Gentry," Debrett's "Baronetage, Knightage, and
Companionage" and "House of Commons and the Judicial Bench, Mr.
Joseph Foster's "Men-at-the-Bar," Messrs. Routledge's "Men and
Women of the Time" and "Men of the Reign," Crockford's "Clerical
Directory" and "The Annual Register."</p>

<p><a name="A2" id="A2"></a><b>Abbott, Hon. Sir Joseph Palmer</b>,
M.L.A., Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, New South Wales, was
born at Muswellbrook, N.S.W., on Sep. 29th, 1842. From his youth
Mr. Abbott has been engaged in pastoral pursuits; but he is also a
solicitor by profession. He was M.L.A. for the district of Gunnedah
from 1880 to 1885, and has since represented Wentworth. Mr. Abbott
was Secretary for Mines in the Stuart Government from Jan. 7th,
1883, to Oct. 7th, 1885; and held the post of Secretary for Lands
in the Dibbs Ministry from Nov. 7th to Dec. 22nd, 1885.
Subsequently Mr. Abbott sat with Mr. Dibbs in Opposition. He,
however, found occasion to take an independent stand, and separated
himself from the main body of protectionists, and was looked upon
as leader of the Third Party in the Assembly&mdash;a section also
known as the Independent and the "Law and Order" party. He was a
member of the New South Wales Commission for the Melbourne
Centennial Exhibition of 1888; and in Oct. 1890 he was elected
Speaker of the Legislative Assembly on the retirement of Mr. Young.
He was one of the delegates of New South Wales to the Federation
Convention held in Sydney in 1891. During the shearers' strike in
1891 he offered his intervention. He was re-elected Speaker later
in the year, and was gazetted to a knighthood on May 25th,
1892.</p>

<p><a name="A3" id="A3"></a><b>Abbott, Robert Palmer</b>, J.P., was
born in Ireland, and came to Sydney when a boy with his parents. He
was admitted a solicitor in 1854. Mr. Abbott entered the
Legislative Assembly in 1872 as member for Tenterfield, and was
returned for Hartley in 1880. He was nominated to the Legislative
Council in 1885, and sat till March 1st, 1888, when he resigned,
owing to his objection to certain appointments. He was Secretary
for Mines in the first Parkes Administration from July 27th, 1874,
to Feb. 8th, 1875, and a member of the New South Wales Commission
in London for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition of 1886.</p>

<p><a name="A4" id="A4"></a><b>a'Beckett, His Honour Thomas</b>,
puisne judge, Victoria, is the eldest son of Mr. Thomas Turner
a'Beckett (q.v.) and was born in 1836. He went to Victoria with his
father, and returned to London in 1856, entering as a student of
Lincoln's Inn on May 18th, 1857. He won a studentship in Nov. 1859,
and was called to the bar on Nov. 17th of the same year. Judge
a'Beckett returned to Victoria, and was admitted to the bar there
on Aug. 16th, 1860, and practised before the Supreme Court in
Melbourne. He married, in 1875, Isabella, daughter of Sir Archibald
Michie, K.C.M.G., Q.C. (q.v.) and was appointed a puisne judge of
the Supreme Court of Victoria on Sept. 30th, 1886. Mr. Justice
a'Beckett was formerly a law lecturer in Melbourne University, but
resigned in 1880. He is still a member of the Faculty of Law in the
University, and was elected a member of the Council on Jan. 10th,
1887.</p>

<p><a name="A5" id="A5"></a><b>a'Beckett, Hon. Thomas Turner</b>,
J.P., comes of a well-known Wiltshire family, long settled at West
Lavington, in that county. He is the son of the late William
a'Beckett, a solicitor in London, and a brother of the late Sir
William a'Beckett (<i>q.v.</i>), and of the late Gilbert Abbott
a'Beckett, the well-known London police magistrate, comic author,
and contributor to <i>Punch</i>. Another brother, Arthur Martin
a'Beckett, F.R.C.S., was a prominent resident in Sydney, and died
there on May 23rd, 1871. Mr. a'Beckett was born on Sept. 18th,
1808, and educated at Westminster School. After leaving he was
articled to his father, and admitted a solicitor and attorney in
1829, when he joined his father in practice. Mr. a'Beckett wrote a
number of able pamphlets advocating legal reforms, and was a member
of the Council of the Law Amendment Society down to 1850, when he
emigrated to Victoria, being admitted to practise as a solicitor in
Melbourne in 1851, and was registrar of the diocese from 1854 to
1887. During the gold fever he published a pamphlet entitled "Gold
and the Government," and was nominated to the Legislative Council
on July 14th, 1852. On the inauguration of responsible government
in 1855 he unsuccessfully attempted to enter the Lower House for
Collingwood, but was elected to the Legislative Council for the
central province, and sat from 1858 to 1878, when he retired from
political life, in the course of which he opposed the ballot, the
abolition of state aid to religion and the export duty on gold, and
gave his adhesion to payment of members. Mr. a'Beckett was a member
of the Heales Ministry without portfolio from Nov. 26th, 1860, to
Nov. 11th, 1861, and was sworn of the Executive Council on Jan.
7th, 1861. In April 1868, on the resignation of Sir James McCulloch
during the Darling Grant crisis, Mr. a'Beckett was applied to by
Lord Canterbury to form a conciliation ministry; but this, after
considerable negotiation, he found himself unable to do, and in the
result the Sladen Ministry was formed. Mr. a'Beckett was
Commissioner of Trade and Customs in the third McCulloch
Administration, from April 9th, 1870, to June 19th, 1871. He was a
member of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service in 1862, and
Chairman of that of 1870. Mr. a'Beckett was also for many years a
member of the Council of Melbourne University, and a trustee of the
Public Library. He was Chairman of the Hobson's Bay Railway Company
down to the time when the line became absorbed in the Government
railway system. Before leaving London, Mr. a'Beckett published
"Remarks on the Present State of the Law of Debtor and Creditor,"
1844; "Railway Litigation, and How to Check It," 1846;
"Law-reforming Difficulties: a Letter to Lord Brougham," 1849.
After his arrival in Victoria he published "A Comparative View of
Court Fees and Attorneys' Charges," 1854; "A Defence of State Aid
to Religion," 1856; "State Aid Question&mdash;Strictures on
Pamphlets of Dr. Cairns," 1856. Mr. a'Beckett from time to time
delivered lectures at the Industrial and Technological Museum,
Melbourne. Several of these, including "Painting and Painters,"
have been published. [Hon. Thomas Turner à Becket died in Melbourne
on July 1st, 1892. Appended in <i>Supplement</i>, p. 529]</p>

<p><a name="A6" id="A6"></a><b>a'Beckett, Sir William</b>, first
Chief Justice of Victoria, was the eldest son of William a'Beckett,
and the brother of T. T. a'Beckett (<i>q.v.</i>). He was born in
London on July 28th, 1806, and educated at Westminster School,
where, in conjunction with his brother Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett, he
started two periodicals of very promising ability, entitled the
<i>Censor</i> and <i>Literary Beacon</i>. He was called to the
English bar in 1827, went to New South Wales in 1837, and was in
1841 appointed Solicitor-General, and subsequently Puisne Judge. He
became judge of the Supreme Court for the district of Port Phillip
on Feb. 3rd, 1846, and on Jan. 19th, 1851 was made first Chief
Justice of the newly constituted colony of Victoria. In the same
year the reckless abandonment of the population to the excitement
of the gold fever called forth a cautionary pamphlet from Sir
William. It was published under the pseudonym "Colonus," and was
entitled, "Does the Discovery of Gold in Victoria, viewed in
relation to its Moral and Social Effects as hitherto developed,
deserve to be considered a National Blessing or a National Curse?"
The judge evidently leant to the latter view. The experiences of a
holiday trip to Europe are contained in a volume by Sir William,
published in London in 1854 entitled "Out of Harness," containing
notes on a tour through Switzerland and Italy. Sir William's health
failed, but he postponed his retirement to suit the convenience of
the Haines Ministry. In 1857, however, he left the bench and
returned to reside in England in 1863, where he published in London
"The Earl's Choice, and other Poems." Sir William died at Upper
Norwood, in Surrey, on June 27th, 1869. In 1832 he married Emily,
daughter of Edward Hayley, who died in 1841. In addition to the
works already mentioned, Sir William published "The Siege of
Dumbarton Castle and other Poems," 1824, a large number of
biographies in "The Georgian Era" (4 vols., 1834-4): "A Universal
Biography; including Scriptural, Classical, and Mythological
Memoirs, together with Accounts of many Eminent Living Characters"
(3 vols., London, 1835); and "The Magistrates' Manual for the
Colony of Victoria" (Melbourne, 1852).</p>

<p><a name="A7" id="A7"></a><b>a'Beckett, Hon. William Arthur
Callendar</b>, J.P., eldest son of the late Sir William a'Beckett
(<i>q.v.</i>), was in the Legislative Council of Victoria from 1868
to 1876, and held office without portfolio in the Administration of
Sir Charles Gavan Duffy from June 1871 to June 10th, 1872. He was
sworn in as a member of the Executive Council on July 31st, 1871.
He represented the first Berry Government in the Legislative
Council, being a member of the Ministry without office from Aug.
7th to Oct. 20th, 1875. He was admitted to the Victorian bar on
Sept. 15th, 1875. Mr. a'Beckett, who was born at Kensington on July
7th, 1833, and educated at King's College, London, and at Downing
College, Cambridge, where he was a Fellow Commoner, has also been
called to the English (Inner Temple) and New South Wales bars. He
married, in Sept. 1855, Emma, only child and heiress of John Mills,
of Melbourne. He has been a magistrate of the colony of Victoria
since 1862, but now resides at Penleigh House, Westbury, Wilts.</p>

M.L.A. for West Sydney from 1880 to June 1891, when he was
defeated. He was Minister of Mines in Sir Henry Parkes'
Administration from Jan. 20th, 1887, to Jan. 10th, 1889, and is a
J.P. of the colonies of New South Wales and Victoria. He was a
member of the New South Wales Commission for the Melbourne
Centennial Exhibition of 1888, and for the Exhibition of Mining and
Metallurgy, held at the Crystal Palace in 1890, in which year he
visited England, and received a cordial welcome from the various
Orange bodies in England and the north of Ireland. Whilst in London
he gave valuable evidence before the Royal Commission on Mines.</p>

<p><a name="A9" id="A9"></a><b>Abraham, Right Reverend Charles
John</b>, M.A., D.D., the son of the late Captain Abraham, R.N., of
Farnborough, Hants, was born in 1815, and educated at Eton and
King's College, Cambridge, of which he was successively Scholar and
Fellow. He was admitted to the degree of B.A. in 1837, M.A. in
1840, B.D. in 1849, and received the degree of D.D. in 1859. He was
ordained deacon in 1838, and priest in the following year. He was
Assistant Master at Eton until 1850, when he went out to New
Zealand to become Master of the English department of St. John's
College, Auckland. In 1853 he was appointed Archdeacon of Waitemata
by the Bishop (Selwyn) of New Zealand. The Bishop had for two or
three years been offering to members of the Church of England a
Church Constitution, whereby they were to govern themselves; and
during the two years which followed, while absent in England, he
left Archdeacon Abraham to propagate and expound the principles of
the Church Constitution. In 1857 a convention of representative
churchmen from all parts of the colony was held in Auckland, which
resulted in the framing of the Constitution now in force. In the
following year Archdeacon Abraham, who had also been acting as
chaplain to the Bishop, was consecrated first Bishop of Wellington
by the Archbishop (Sumner) of Canterbury and Bishops (Wilberforce)
of Oxford and (Lonsdale) of Lichfield. When the Maori war broke out
by reason of the purchase by the Government of the Waitara block,
Bishop Abraham presented a protest to the Governor, claiming for
the Maoris as British subjects the right to be heard in the Supreme
Court. In 1870 he resigned his see, and, returning to England, was
made coadjutor to Dr. Selwyn, then Bishop of Lichfield. This office
he held until the death of Bishop Selwyn, in 1878. From 1872 to
1876 he was Prebendary of Bobenhall in Lichfield Cathedral, and in
1875-6 was rector of Tattenhill, Staffordshire. Since 1876 he has
been Canon and Precentor of Lichfield Cathedral. He married in 1850
Caroline Harriet, daughter of Sir Charles Thomas Palmer, Bart., of
Wanlip Hall, Leicestershire, and cousin of the wife of Bishop
Selwyn. She died in 1877. Bishop Abraham is the author of "Festival
and Lenten Lectures in St. George's Chapel, Windsor," 1848-9
(Parker), and other works.</p>

Joseph</b>, C.B., K.H., was born in 1789, and joined the army in
1805 as ensign in the 78th Regiment. He served with singular
bravery and distinction, being on several occasions severely
wounded in Egypt and at Talavera, Busaco and Torres Vedras in the
Peninsular War. Having become major of the 50th Regiment he was in
1834 appointed by Governor Sir Richard Bourke, of New South Wales,
to take charge of the convict establishment at Norfolk Island, as
Military Commandant and Civil Superintendent. The miserable felons
were then in a state of chronic mutiny, and steeped in every
species of crime. At imminent personal risk, Major Anderson, whilst
maintaining rigid discipline, introduced a kindlier and more
humanising system, and with the best results. In 1837 Major
Anderson was created K.H., and subsequently became lieut.-colonel
After leaving Norfolk Island, he saw active service in India, and
commanded a brigade in the Gwalior campaign in 1843, during which
he was severely wounded, and for which he received the C.B. in
1844. In 1848 he retired from the army, and took up his permanent
residence in Port Phillip, where he engaged in squatting pursuits
on the Goulburn River. In 1852 he was nominated to the first
Legislative Council of Victoria, to fill a vacancy in the list of
non-official nominee members, caused by the death of Mr. Dunlop. In
this capacity he supported the Convicts Act Prevention Bill, which
was designed to prevent the influx of convicts from Tasmania into
Victoria; and when the measure, having been disallowed by the
Imperial authorities, was again adopted by the Council in the
ensuing session, Colonel Anderson was the mover of an address to
the Queen, setting forth the reasons which induced the Legislative
Council to again pass the bill. In 1854 Colonel Anderson served on
the Colonial Defence Committee, and in the following year in a
debate on the immigration question strongly advocated the adoption
of prohibitive legislation, with the view of stopping the influx of
Chinese. Colonel Anderson died at South Yarra, Melbourne, on July
18th, 1877.</p>

Victoria in June 1854. Whilst practising as a solicitor in
Melbourne he resided in the suburb of Emerald Hill, and was
Chairman of the Municipal Council and representative of the
district in Parliament. Mr. Anderson was Commissioner of Trade and
Customs in the Heales Ministry from November 1860 to January 1861,

dictated by the opposition, Mr. Heales revising his budget in
accordance with Sir John O'Shanassy's resolution that the public
expenditure should be kept down to £3,000,000 per annum. Mr.
Anderson, however, took office in the O'Shanassy Ministry which
succeeded the Heales Government, being Commissioner of Trade and
Customs from November 1861 to June 1863. When Mr. Haines died in
1864 Mr. Anderson succeeded him as member for the Eastern Province
in the Legislative Council, and he was Commissioner of Public Works
and vice-president of the Board of Land and Works in the Francis
Ministry from May to July 1874, when the Cabinet was reconstructed
under the premiership of the late Mr. Kerferd, under whom Mr.
Anderson held the same offices till August 1875, when the first
Berry Ministry was formed. The latter having been defeated, Mr.
Anderson came back to office under Sir James McCulloch in October
1875 as Commissioner of Trade and Customs, and held that post till
the Ministry was again displaced by Mr. (now Sir Graham) Berry in
May 1877. From March to August 1880 Mr. Anderson was a member of

<p><a name="A41" id="A41"></a><b>Angas, George Fife</b>, J.P., was
the seventh son of Caleb Angas, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, a
coachbuilder, merchant and shipowner in a largo way of business in
that town, where he was born on May 1st, 1789. The family was of
Scotch origin, and the first of its representatives to settle on
Tyneside was one Alexander Angus, about the year 1584. This
Alexander, from whom Caleb was fifth in lineal descent, ultimately
located himself at Raw House, near Hexham, in Northumberland, where
his descendants were farmers for several generations. It was John
Angus, of Scotland, Hexham, the grandfather of the subject of this
notice, who first changed the spelling of the family name from
Angus to Angas. Caleb Angas wished his son on leaving school to
embrace the legal profession; but he preferred entering his
father's business, and was duly apprenticed to the coachbuilding,
working his way through the various grades of the craft, and
ultimately supplementing his local experience by serving as a
journeyman in a London factory, which he left in 1809 to assume the
oversight of his father's establishment Shortly after his return to
Newcastle he was admitted a member of the Baptist Church, a
religious body to whose tenets he ever afterwards remained
attached. Mr. Angas married, on April 8th, 1812, Rosetta, daughter
of Mr. French, of Hutton. His father's firm was largely interested
in the trade of British Honduras, where they had an agency, and
from whence they were large importers of mahogany and dyewoods. Mr.
Angas, at an early period, took a deep interest in the welfare of
the Indian aborigines, who, in defiance of the law, were held in
slavery, and deprived of all means of improvement and civilisation.
Mainly through his persevering efforts their freedom was assured,
and means of instruction provided by the establishment of missions.
Mr. Angas also took a deep interest in educational matters at home,
and was one of the founders of the Newcastle Sunday School Union, a
history of the successful operations of which body was many years
later (1869) published at his expense. In 1823 Mr. Angas became
greatly impressed with the importance to British interests of
cutting a canal through the Isthmus of Darien, on the lines
recently adopted by the Nicaragua Canal Company. In the result,
however, the scheme dropped through, as far as any practical action
on Mr. Angas's part was concerned. A project for the establishment
of a society for promoting Christianity and civilisation through
the medium of commercial, scientific and professional agency was
also mooted in 1825 by Mr. Angas, who thought that trade and
evangelisation should go hand in hand; but this scheme, too, had to
be dropped from want of encouragement on the part of the mercantile
community. About this time the foreign trade of the firm rendered
it necessary to open an office in London, and Mr. Angas, who had
been for some time in partnership with his father and brothers,
removed to the south, in order to superintend the working of the
new departure. His capacity and resources were strained to the
uttermost by the commercial panic of 1826, and at the end of that
year he retired from connection with the coachbuilding
establishment at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and carried on a distinct
mercantile and shipping business, under the style of "G. F. Angas
&amp; Co.," of London, and "Angas &amp; Co.," of Newcastle-on-Tyne.
He was strongly interested in the reform agitation, and when the
passage of the bill of 1832 was assured he was pressed to stand for
his native town, and subsequently for the borough of Sunderland.
Both these invitations he, however, declined. In 1833 Mr. Angas
took an active part in founding the National Provincial Bank of
England, of which his cousin, Mr. Joplin, was the originator. Of
this eminently successful concern Mr. Angas was for three years a
director, resigning his seat on the board in 1836, when, having
taken up his residence at Dawlish, in Devonshire, he desired to
restrict his commercial responsibilities in London as far as
possible to his own business. In the meantime Mr. Angas had
prospered in his various concerns, and became a wealthy man. In the
year 1829 Mr. Robert Gouger formed the idea of founding the colony
of South Australia, on the principles of Edward Gibbon Wakefield,
but the project did not get beyond the appointment of a provisional
committee. Two years later Mr. Gouger recurred to his previous
design, and formulated a scheme for starting a "South Australian
Land Company." Of the provisional committee of this company, Mr.
Angas, who had all along been an ardent advocate of emigration and
colonisation, became a member, and subscribed for a sufficient
number of shares to qualify himself as a director. His first steps
were to enter a protest against paupers being sent out, to express
the hope that the appointment of a governor would be left in the
hands of the Company until the population reached 10,000, and
secured a Legislative Assembly, and that "Bible truth should be
given unfettered, and without State aid." In the event of his
associates not approving of these views, he begged that his name
might be struck out of the list of promoters. As the colonisation
scheme shaped itself more clearly in his mind, the platform of Mr.
Angas was enlarged, and he stood out for the following distinctive
points: 1. The exclusion of convicts; 2. The concentration of the
settlers; 3. The taking out of persons of capital and intelligence,
and especially men of piety; 4. The emigration of young couples of
good character; 5. Free trade, free government, and freedom in
matters of religion. Though the prospects at first appeared
favourable, the minister of the day, Lord Goderich, ultimately
declined to adopt the draft charter submitted to him, or to suggest
an alternative scheme; with the result that the second attempt to
found the colony fell to the ground, and Mr. Angas made up his mind
not to take part in any future attempts to settle South Australia.
Events were, however, too strong for him, for in 1834, spurred on
by the indefatigable Mr. Gouger, a number of influential public and
commercial men formed themselves into "The South Australian
Association," with Mr. W. W. Whitmore, M.P., as chairman, and Mr.
George Grote, M.P., as treasurer. The new combination succeeded in
securing the passing of an Act constituting the colony of South
Australia, and conferring the power of disposing of the lands of
the territory on a Board of Commissioners to be appointed under it
Mr. Angas, at the request of Mr. Gouger, consented to join the
Board if the Government approved; and in May 1835 the names of
himself and his colleagues were gazetted, Mr. (afterwards Sir)
Rowland Hill becoming secretary to the Commissioners. Amongst other
things the Act stipulated that £35,000 worth of land must be
disposed of, and a loan of £20,000 raised, with the view of
guaranteeing the Home Government against possible outlay, before
the colony could occupied, or the Commissioners exercise their
powers. Mr. Angas insisted that the only way in which these
conditions could be satisfied would be by forming a joint stock
company, to buy the stipulated quantity of land and take over the
whole of the pecuniary responsibility. To this the majority of the
Commissioners could not at first be induced to assent; but, all
other methods proving fruitless, they, after a prolonged period of
indecision and delay, allowed Mr. Angas to have his way. He, with
two others, agreed to find the necessary purchase-money, on
condition that the price of the land was reduced to 12<i>s.</i> per
acre from 20<i>s.</i>, at which it had been fixed. This was agreed
to, the Company was formed, and the £35,000 worth of land was then
transferred to them at cost price, Mr. Angas being appointed
chairman of the first Board of Directors. This was the origin of
the South Australian Company, which started in Oct. 1835 with a
capital of £200,000. Mr. Angas now found that the Government
considered the duties of a commissioner and of a director of the
Company incompatible. As, however, his colleagues on both boards
were desirous of retaining his services, Lord Glenelg was
interviewed upon the matter, but ultimately decided, with great
reluctance, that if Mr. Angas remained a director of the Company he
could not continue a member of the Board of Commissioners. He
thought, however, that there could be no objection to Mr. Angas
remaining on the Board of Commissioners till his successor was
appointed, or for a limited period, say of three months. This
decision Mr. Angas accepted, and then resigned in Dec. 1836. In the
meantime the success of the Company's operations was almost wholly
due to the individual energy of Mr. Angas, under whose auspices the
first shiploads of emigrants were despatched in Feb. 1836, the
colony being proclaimed by Captain Hindmarsh, the first Governor,
in December following. At Mr. Angas's suggestion, and almost
entirely on the lines he sketched out, a banking department was
instituted, and proved of immense use in affording financial
facilities to the early settlers. In 1841 the department (again at
Mr. Angas's instigation) was formed into a separate concern, with
the title of the "South Australian Banking Company," which latter
was in 1867 again transmogrified into the "Bank of South
Australia." In 1837 Mr. Angas became one of the founders of the
Union Bank of Australia, and was the first chairman of the Board of
Directors, all of whom were appointed on his personal selection.
Amongst the stipulations in the deed of settlement of the Union
Bank was one restricting them from opening a branch in South
Australia without the assent of the South Australian Company. In
the same and the next year Mr. Angas laid the foundation of German
emigration to South Australia by advancing a large sum of money to
enable several hundreds of Prussian Lutherans to seek refuge in the
new colony from the persecution with which they were threatened, in
consequence of their opposition to the Government scheme for
uniting the Reformed and Lutheran Churches. In 1838 Mr. Angas
cautioned the British Government against the danger of having New
Zealand exposed to the risk of a French annexation; and, as the
result of his expostulations, Captain Hobson, R.N., was sent out to
treat with the natives for the acceptance of the Queen's
sovereignty only just in time to avert the action on the part of
the French Government which Mr. Angas had foreseen. For the next
few years Mr. Angas was plunged in financial embarrassments, owing,
in a large degree, to the unauthorised action of his confidential
agent, Mr. Flaxman, who had gone out with the first batch of German
emigrants, in buying considerable tracts of Land in South
Australia, and then drawing on his employer for large sums to meet
the purchase-money. Just at the pressing moment the German
emigrants, to whom he looked for partial relief, failed to pay up
the instalments of the money advanced them as stipulated, and thus
added greatly to their benefactor's difficulties. Amidst his own
distresses he was, however, able to lend a helping hand to South
Australia when her affairs became involved, through the dishonour
of Governor Gawler's drafts on the Home Government; it being
greatly owing to his exposition of her resources and prospects
before the select committee which was appointed, that the Imperial
authorities were induced to come to the assistance of the nascent
colony. Mr. Angas was, in the meantime, indefatigable in his
efforts to popularise South Australia as an emigration field;
delivering lectures on the subject in various parts of the country,
and starting two weekly newspapers, <i>The South Australian
Colonist</i> and <i>The South Australian Weekly News</i>, at a
heavy financial loss, in order to disseminate reliable data. Mr.
Angas's two eldest sons had already proceeded to South Australia,
and as his prospects darkened in England they appeared to be
brightening at the antipodes. Having resigned his seat on the Board
of the South Australian Company in 1848, he determined to take up
his residence on his Australian property, and, fortunately, was
able to dispose of his English concerns on advantageous terms. He
sailed for Adelaide by the ship <i>Ascendant</i> on Oct. 3rd, 1850,
with his wife and youngest son, William Henry, who died in 1879. He
was cordially welcomed on his arrival as the virtual father and
founder of South Australia, and seemed never able to divest himself
of the idea that the colony was still in as much need as in the
days of its initiation of his paternal care and control. There was
thus a dictatorial tone in his speeches and addresses, which
prevented his becoming a popular, though he was always a respected,
publicist. Even in this direction he had his consolations, for the
new constitution rendering the Legislative Council partially
representative having gone out in the same ship as that by which he
travelled, he was at once returned to the new body for Barossa,
and, in his parliamentary capacity, had the privilege of assisting
in giving the final death-stroke to the system of State aid to
religion, to which he had all along been so strenuously opposed. In
connection with the New Constitution Act an amusing story is told.
It had been an ambition of Mr. Angas's to be the personal bearer of
the official copy of the Act to the colony; but it was found to be
contrary to precedent, and red-tape triumphed, the important
document being sent from the Colonial Office in charge of a clerk,
who gave the package to a steward, who, being very busy, thrust it
into the nearest place of safety. On arrival in Adelaide the proper
authorities came on board to demand their Constitution, and receive
it with due honour. The captain, however, protested that he had
seen nothing of it, and there was a great hue and cry for the lost
Constitution, until one day shortly after, in turning out the
captain's soiled linen for the laundress, it was found, to the
great amusement of every one, at the bottom of the bag, the place
in which the steward had hurriedly placed it for security. In 1855,
when he was again re-elected, Mr. Angas assisted in framing the
present Constitution Act, and thus participated in crowning the
edifice of public freedom in the colony, whose foundations he had
laid in fear and trembling, and amidst much of doubt and
difficulty. In his worldly affairs his prosperity was great and
growing; the property purchased by Mr. Flaxman turning out to have
been admirably selected, and rendering its proprietor wealthy
beyond any dreams of avarice in which he might have indulged. Mr.
Angas was a liberal contributor to charitable and religious objects
of a Protestant character. The Roman Catholic Church was the object
of the strongest abhorrence, and it was doubtless a severe blow to
him to witness its growth and progress under a <i>régime</i> of
religious equality, which he had fondly believed would secure the
undisputed predominance of Protestant Nonconformity. Even in his
eighty-first year he flooded the colony with an issue of anti-papal
literature, which certainly did not lack controversial vigour and
pugnacity. Whatever may have been his faults of egotism and
intolerance, they were the outcome of one of those strong and
sturdy individualities which have made England what it is; and
South Australia certainly owes it to Mr. Angas that she took her
place in the ranks of civilised communities many years earlier than
would otherwise have been the case. During the discussions on the
present Constitution Act Mr. Angas, whilst opposing manhood
suffrage and vote by ballot, was a staunch supporter of an elective
as against a nominee Upper House, and this was the principle
ultimately adopted. In 1857 he was elected a member of the new
Council, and was absent for two years in England (Dec. 1857 to
Sept. 1859) without resigning his seat. In 1865 he was re-elected
on his seat becoming vacant by effuxion of time, but he retired
from parliament in the following year, and died on Jan. 15th, 1879.
Mrs. Angas died on Jan. 14th, 1867.</p>

art tour through Australia and New Zealand, returning in March 1846
with a large collection of native costumes and implements, besides
many portraits of natives which he had taken, as well as sketches
of the places he had visited. These he had the honour of showing to
Her Majesty and the Prince Consort, who became patrons of the
illustrated volumes he subsequently published on South Australia
and New Zealand. He subsequently returned to South Australia, where
he was resident when his father went out in 1850. Returning to
England, he died in London in Oct 1886. "South Australia
Illustrated" and "New Zealand Illustrated," two illustrated folio
works, were issued at intervals in 1847.</p>

1823. When but twenty years of age (April 1843) he left England for
South Australia to assume the management of his father's affairs in
that colony, and especially to develop his landed property, a
mission he accomplished with eminent success. In 1854, four years
after his father's arrival in the colony, he revisited England, and
married, in 1855, Miss Susanna Collins, of Bowden, near Manchester.
The next year he returned to South Australia, and became famous as
a breeder of first-class sheep, cattle and horses. In Dec. 1871 he
was elected to the Legislative Assembly for the district of
Barossa, and sat till May 1875, when he resigned. In 1882 Mr. Angas
gave up squatting on a large scale, but still takes an active
interest in his stud farms at Hill River and Collingrove. He has
been a member of the Legislative Council for a number of years
past. Mr. Angas, who started the Bushman's Club, has founded an
engineering scholarship and three engineering exhibitions in
connection with the University of Adelaide, and has given other
liberal donations to public objects. A year or two ago he informed
the committee of the Adelaide Home for Incurables of his
willingness to contribute £2500 for the erection of a wing to the
building, and suggested that the Government should be asked to
contribute a like sum towards the establishment of a maintenance
fund.</p>

engineering establishment in Scotland, Mr. Archer emigrated to
Australia, where he arrived in 1842, but only stayed five months,
subsequently spending thirteen years in the South Sea and Sandwich
Islands. In the latter he was engaged on coffee and sugar
plantations. Returning to Queensland in 1860, he took up his
residence at Gracemere station, and in 1867 was returned to the
Legislative Assembly for the Rockhampton district, which he still
represents, though he has been out of Parliament and has sat for
other constituencies in the interim. Mr. Archer, who assisted in
passing the Land Act of 1868, was Colonial Treasurer and Secretary
for Public Instruction in the first McIlwraith Government from Jan.
1882 to Nov. 1883. Mr. Archer has recently figured as a strong
advocate of the subdivision of Queensland. In 1892 Mr. Archer

<p><a name="A51" id="A51"></a><b>Archer, Thomas</b>, C.M.G., J.P.,
ex-Agent-General for Queensland, son of William Archer by Julia,
daughter of David Walker, of Perth, Scotland, was born at Glasgow
on Feb. 27th, 1823. At the age of seventeen he emigrated to New
South Wales, arriving in Sydney on Dec 31st, 1837. He engaged in
pastoral pursuits, and, with two of his elder brothers, Messrs.
John and David Archer, decided to try his fortunes in Queensland,
then the Moreton Bay district of New South Wales. In August 1841
the three brothers started from Castlereagh River, N.S.W., with
about five thousand sheep, passing near where now stands
Goondiwindia, the line which sixteen years later became the
boundary between New South Wales and Queensland. They then crossed
the Condamine about a dozen miles below Canning Downs, which had
shortly before been discovered and occupied by the brothers
Patrick, Walter, and George Leslie, and where the flourishing town
of Warwick was afterwards founded; travelled across Darling Downs,
then without road or track, to Eton Vale, which had been lately
occupied by Mr. (now Sir Arthur) Hodgson. Continuing on their way,
past where now stand Drayton and Toowoomba townships, they crossed
the Main Range by "Hodgson's Gap," and turned northward, through
unoccupied country, by Wingate's Lagoon and Mount Brisbane, soon
after taken up by the brothers Frederick and Francis Biggs. Thence
they pushed on to Durandur, on Stanley Creek, the eastern head of
the Brisbane, near Glasshouse Mountains, a country that had been
explored by David Archer. Here they remained some four or five
years, and were soon joined by their eldest brother Charles. They
afterwards explored and occupied two runs close under the Main
Range, called Emu Creek and Cooyar, where they remained about four
years. Hearing that Fitzroy Downs and Mount Abundance had been
discovered by Sir Thomas Mitchell, Surveyor-General of New South
Wales, who came upon it from the south, Mr. Archer started in 1848
across the Main Range to Jimbour, then occupied by Sir Joshua Peter
Bell. From Jimbour he set off, accompanied by Mr. Arthur Chauvelle
and a black boy, to find a way to Fitzroy Downs; and after a
fortnight's scrambling through scrubs and over mountains, one of
which he named Mount Horrible, they emerged upon Fitzroy Downs, and
saw Mount Abundance in the distance, and then returned half-starved
to Darling Downs, having for a week existed on blackducks and tea.
Fitzroy Downs being too distant to be taken up by small squatters,
Mr. Archer set off on another exploration trip to the Upper Burnett
River, where he discovered two runs, which were afterwards named
Eidsvold and Coonambula. From here they opened a road to Wetherun
Station, then held by Messrs. Humphries and Herbert, and were the
first&mdash;or among the first&mdash;who took a load of wool to
Maryborough, and shipped it, in that now flourishing port, for
Sydney, in a forty-ton schooner. After about a year on the Burnett,
Mr. Archer set off in 1849 for California; and, after three years
there, returned to England <i>viâ</i> Panama. He was absent from
the colony about four years, and in 1853, shortly before he
returned, his brothers Charles and William explored what was
afterwards Gracemere Station, and discovered and named the Fitzroy
River. The portion of the Dee Range, from which they obtained their
first view of Gracemere, was not far from the now world-renowned
Mount Morgan, but no portion of it ever fell to their lot.
Gracemere was occupied and stocked in 1854-5. A sailing-boat,
<i>Elida</i>, was built at Maryborough, and in her one of Mr.
Archer's younger brothers, Colin, with one man, sailed with a cargo
of supplies, via Gladstone and Keppel Bay, up the
Fitzroy&mdash;then unsurveyed, and to white men unknown&mdash;the
cargo being landed on a wharf made of slabs and saplings, on the
spot where now stands the Government wharf at Rockhampton. Mr.
Archer's brothers also gave Norwegian names&mdash;Berserker and
Sleipner&mdash;to hills on the north side of the Fitzroy, Norway
having been their home in their boyhood. About a year after
Gracemere was occupied, Charles Archer, in company with Mr.
Wiseman, police magistrate, after much exploration and discussion,
fixed upon the site for a township, Mr. Wiseman naming it
Rockhampton, that name being adopted on account of the rocky bar
above the town, which blocks navigation for large vessels. Mr.
Archer, having revisited England, returned to the Colony in 1871,
remaining until 1878, when he finally took up his residence in
England. He was appointed Acting Agent-General for Queensland in
London in July 1881, and Agent-General in Nov. 1881. From this post
he retired in May 1884, but was reappointed on Sir Thomas
McIlwraith's return to power in June 1888, but again resigned on
Dec. 10th, 1890. Mr. Archer was created C.M.G. in 1884. He was
married in 1853, at Perth, N.B., to Grace Lindsay, daughter of
James Morison, of Muirton, Perth. His eldest son, Mr. William
Archer, is the well-known author and dramatic critic.</p>

studied engineering in London until his twentieth year, when, on
Feb. 28th, 1815, he sailed for Australia in the <i>Hebe</i>, which
reached Sydney in August. In the following year he landed in
Tasmania, where he was allotted a few acres of land at Bagdad,
which were increased to 500 acres in 1817. In 1826 he received a
further grant of 1000 acres, built upon it the first watermill in
Tasmania, and, in spite of troubles with blacks and bushrangers,
became successful. In 1835 Port Phillip commenced to attract
settlers; and in 1836 his eldest son Thomas visited the district,
and camped on the Werribee. In 1847 Mr. Armytage proceeded to
Victoria, and settled upon his son George Armytage's station at
Ingleby, where his eldest son had died of typhus fever on Sept.
12th, 1842. In 1851 he settled at Geelong, and built "The
Hermitage." In 1818 he married Miss Elizabeth Peters. He died of

his degree (first class in classics) in 1848. After serving for
some time in the Colonial Office he emigrated in 1847 to New
Zealand, intending to settle there as a farmer. Not finding this
employment congenial or profitable, he proceeded to Tasmania, where
he received the appointment of Inspector of Schools. While in
Tasmania he married Julia, daughter of William Sorell, Registrar of
Deeds, and granddaughter of Colonel Sorell, sometime Governor of
the island. In 1855 Mr. Arnold, carried away even in the Antipodes
by the "Oxford Movement," followed its leader into the Church of
Rome. He relinquished his post and returned to England, when he

Assembly for Talbot, established a reputation as a debater, and
became still more widely celebrated in social circles as the
recognised wit of the colony. He succeeded Mr. R. D. Ireland as
Attorney-General in the Heales Administration in July 1861, and
held office until November of that year. He became member for
Portland, and was Solicitor-General in the Macpherson Ministry from

Assembly, was born at Fernhill, Cork, Ireland, on Nov. 29th, 1841,
and died at Sandgate, Qd., on May 25th, 1872. He was a relative of
the late Thomas Davis, whose biography has recently been written by
Sir Charles Gavan Duffy. He was buried at Sandgate, where a
monument was erected to his memory by the members of the Hibernian
Society of Queensland, of which he was vice-president.</p>

<p><a name="A58" id="A58"></a><b>Atkinson, Major Hon. Sir Harry
Albert</b>, K.C.M.G., M.L.C., President Legislative Council, New
Zealand, is a native of England. [He was born in Cheshire in 1831*]
and emigrated to New Zealand, where he landed in 1855 with his
brother Decimus, and settled on some land in the Taranaki district,
where he lived all through the Maori war. The energy of the young
colonists in these parts soon took upon it the burden of the
tedious war; and a band of volunteers was organised, with Mr.
Atkinson as captain, which proved more effective in the issue than
the trained regulars, whose freedom of action was hampered by
military traditions. The first action in which Mr. Atkinson was
engaged was at Waireka, on March 28th, 1860, where the Colonial
troops greatly distinguished themselves. Subsequently he took part
in the capture of several <i>pas</i> at Kaihihi in Oct. 1860, in
the battle of Mahoetahi on Nov. 6th, and the battle of Matarikoriko
in December. He was present at the capture of Kaitake on March
24th, 1864, at Sentry Hill, at Ahu-Ahu, at Allen's Hill, at
Manutahi, and at Mataitawa. For these and other services he was
advanced to the rank of major, and received the thanks of the
Government. Previous to this he had been elected to the Parliament
of 1863, and on Nov. 24th, 1864, took office as Minister of Defence
under Sir Frederick Weld. This was a time of great difficulties,
for the conduct of the war had forced upon the consideration of the
Ministry the advisability of dispensing with the support of the
Home Government. It was upon this point that Major Atkinson came
first into notice as a politician, for his speech upon the second
reading of the Militia Act Repeal Bill was the proclamation of a
new era. The English forces were to be withdrawn, and henceforth
the colony was to depend upon herself. This principle was accepted
by both Houses, and it seemed at first as if the Weld Government,
called to establish a new <i>régime</i>, would carry with it the
sense of the country. But a series of misfortunes befell the
Ministry. The removal of the seat of government from Auckland to
Wellington leagued the north against them; financial difficulties
embarrassed them; misunderstandings between the Governor and the
Ministry were succeeded by a quarrel between the Governor and Sir
Duncan Cameron, the general in command of the English forces. In
the end, despite some changes in the <i>personnel</i> of the
Government, Sir Frederick Weld resigned upon a virtual defeat in an
attempt to carry stamp duties, and Sir Edward Stafford was called
to power, on Oct 16th, 1865. The Stafford Ministry lasted, with
some alterations, till June 28th, 1869; and in 1867-8 Major
Atkinson took an active part in the discussions which took place
upon the war. From 1869 to 1873 he was not in Parliament. In the
latter year he was again returned to the General Assembly. In Oct.
1872 the third Stafford Administration, which lasted only for a
month, was succeeded by a Ministry, with Mr. G. M. Waterhouse as
Premier; but this Cabinet was reconstructed twice, the first time
under Sir William Fox, and the second under Sir Julius Vogel. Under
the latter Major Atkinson accepted the portfolios of Secretary for
Crown Lands and Minister for Immigration on Sept. 7th and 10th,
1874, respectively. On July 6th, 1875, a third reconstruction took
place, and Dr. Pollen became Premier, Major Atkinson taking from
him the portfolio of Colonial Treasurer, which he added to his
former offices. It was in 1875 that the very important Bill
abolishing the provincial legislatures, which had been announced in
the previous year by Sir Julius Vogel as the policy of the
Government, was carried; and it fell to the task of Major Atkinson,
as leader of the Lower House, to move the second reading of the
bill, which was carried by 52 votes to 17, and subsequently passed
through the Upper House and became law. On Feb. 15th, 1876, Sir
Julius Vogel resumed his place as Premier and Colonial Treasurer;
and, in lieu of the latter office, allotted to his colleague the
portfolio of Commissioner of Customs; and at the last rearrangement
of this changeful Ministry, upon the departure of Sir Julius Vogel
to assume the position of Agent-General in London, Major Atkinson
took his place as Premier and Colonial Treasurer. But twelve days
later there was a readjustment of offices, and the Premier became
also Secretary for Crown Lands and Minister for Immigration once
more. On Oct. 14th, 1877, the Atkinson Ministry retired, and was
succeeded by the Grey Cabinet, which, however, was defeated on Oct.
8th, 1879, when Mr. (afterwards Sir) John Hall came into office,
Major Atkinson becoming Colonial Treasurer. On April 21st, 1882,
Sir John Hall retired from the Premiership owing to ill-health, and
was succeeded by Sir Frederick Whitaker, Major Atkinson continuing
to hold the office of Colonial Treasurer, as well as those of
Commissioner of Stamp Duties and Customs and Minister of Marine. On
Sept. 25th, 1883, he became Premier; but retired on Aug. 18th,
1884, when Sir Julius Vogel formed a Ministry. The Vogel Cabinet
only lasted ten days, and on Aug. 28th Major Atkinson again came
in; but the party led by Sir George Grey once more overthrew the
balance, and the Ministry resigned on Aug. 30th, giving place to a
combination of Sir Julius Vogel and Mr. (now Sir) Robert Stout.
This lasted until Oct. 11th, 1887, when Major Atkinson once more
came into office as Premier and Colonial Treasurer. In 1890 Major
Atkinson, who had been in exceedingly bad health, retired from
active work, though still holding together his colleagues as
nominal Premier. The result of the general election in December of
that year being adverse, Sir Harry Atkinson, who was created
K.C.M.G. in 1888, advised his own nomination to the post of
President of the Legislative Council in succession to the late Sir
William Fitzherbert. His acceptance of this position, broke up the
Ministry, and made way for the accession to office of Mr. Ballance
and his colleagues in Jan. 1891. [Sir Harry Atkinson died on June
28th, 1892&mdash;Appended in <i>Supplement</i>, p. 529]</p>

<p><a name="A59" id="A59"></a><b>Austin, Thomas</b>, a well-known
Victorian squatter, came out with his parents from Great Britain to
Tasmania about the year 1835. The former, however, soon returned to
the old country, leaving their family to test the advantages of
colonial life. Mr. Thomas Austin, accompanied by his brother, James
(now of Glastonbury Abbey, Somerset), left Tasmania in 1839, for
the then little known settlement of Port Phillip, taking with them
a number of sheep which they ultimately depastured on country to
the west ward of Geelong, on the east bank of the Barwon River,
near what is now the town of Winchelsea. To this property they gave
the name of Barwon Park&mdash;a name now historic in the annals of
stock raising and wool growing, Mr. Austin being the first to
introduce Lincoln sheep into Australia, besides which he
acclimatised various kinds of game on his extensive property, which
still remains in the possession of the family. Mr. Austin married,
on August 14th, 1845, Elizabeth Phillip Harding, daughter of Robert
Harding, of Middle Chinnock, Somerset, and granddaughter of James
Harding, of Hurly Grove, in that county, the munificent founder of
the Hospital for Incurables at Heidelberg, near Melbourne, and a
lady whose acts of charity have rendered her name a household word
throughout the colony of Victoria. Mr. Thomas Austin died on Dec.
15th, 1871.</p>

<p><a name="A60" id="A60"></a><b>Ayers, Hon. Sir Henry</b>,
K.C.M.G., M.L.C., son of Mr. Ayers of Portsmouth Dockyard, was born
at Portsea, England, on May 1st, 1821, and emigrated to South
Australia in 1840, where he engaged in legal pursuits until 1845,
when he took the management of the Burra Burra Mines, as Secretary
to the Company formed to work them. In March 1857 he was elected a
member of the Legislative Council, and has ever since retained a
seat in that body. He was a member of the Dutton Ministry, without
office for a few days in July 1863, and then formed an
Administration, of which he was Chief Secretary and Premier. This
Government lasted till August 1864, Mr. Ayers retaining the Chief
Secretaryship under his two successors in the Premiership, and in
his own subsequent Administration till Oct. 1865. He was Premier
and Chief Secretary on four subsequent occasions&mdash;viz. from
May 1867 to Sept. 1868, Oct. to Nov. 1868, Jan. to March 1872, and
March 1872 to July 1873. Mr. Ayers was also Chief Secretary in the
Colton Government from June 1876 to Oct. 1877. In Feb. 1870 he was
created C.M.G, and K.C.M.G. in Dec. 1872, owing to the fact of his
being Premier of South Australia at the time when the overland
telegraph line was opened for traffic. In June 1881 Sir Henry was
elected President of the Legislative Council, and has since been
re-elected to the position, which he still holds.</p>

<p><a name="A62" id="A62"></a><b>Backhouse, James</b>, son of James
Backhouse, of Darlington, Durham, England, and Mary his wife,
daughter of N. Dearman, of Pindar Oaks, Darfield, Yorkshire, was
born at Darlington on July 8th, 1794. The Backhouse family were
well known throughout the North of England as bankers, but James
Backhouse was early attracted to the study of botany, and in 1815
he purchased the nursery grounds of Messrs. Telford at York, in
which business he found an occupation congenial to his tastes. He
early became a minister of the Society of Friends, of which body
his family were prominent members. In 1827 he married Deborah,
daughter of Richard Lowe of Worcester. For some years he was
impressed with the belief that it was his duty to visit the
Australian colonies, and eventually, in the year 1880, he
determined to leave his business for that purpose, and he was
accredited by the Society of Friends on a religions mission to the
"Colonies and Settlements of New Holland, Van Diemen's Land, and
South Africa." Mr. Backhouse was accompanied by Mr. George W.
Walker (<i>q.v.</i>). The two friends arrived in Hobart in February
1832, and began the work which was to occupy them more than eight
years. They spent three years in Van Diemen's Land and two years in
New South Wales, travelling in all places where settlers were to be
found, and systematically visiting every chain-gang and convict
station, including the penal settlements of Macquarie Harbour,
Norfolk Island, and Moreton Bay (now Brisbane). The Governors of
the Colonies offered them every facility and encouragement in their
benevolent efforts for the welfare of the prisoners, and their
reports had no small influence in promoting reforms of the penal
system, and in bettering the condition of the convicts. Leaving
Hobart on their way to the Cape, they visited (1837) Melbourne,
Adelaide, King George's Sound, and Swan River,&mdash;settlements
then in their infancy. After a few months' stay at Mauritius, they
reached Cape Town in 1838. They spent nearly two years in Cape
Colony, travelling in their ox-wagon to the most remote parts,
visiting mission stations, and specially devoting their efforts to
benefiting the coloured people and the poorest classes of the
population. Mr. Backhouse returned to England in 1841, and
published an account of his travels in two works of much
interest&mdash;"Narrative of a Visit to the Australian Colonies"
(London, 1843); and "Narrative of a Visit to the Mauritius and
South Africa" (London, 1844). These volumes contain a mass of
interesting information concerning the condition of the Colonies,
and are full of valuable observations with regard to the natural
history, and especially the flora of Tasmania and Australia, Mr.
Backhouse being an enthusiastic and accomplished botanist. From the
date of his return to England in 1841, to his death, Mr. Backhouse
devoted his attention to business at the well-known Nursery Gardens
at York, and introduced many new ferns and other plants into
English gardens. Besides the works above mentioned, he was joint
author of "The Life and Labours of George W. Walker" (London,
1862). He died at York on Jan. 20th, 1869.</p>

born at Sutton Forest, N.S.W., on Dec. 9th, 1840, and married, in
1869, Julia, daughter of G. M. Pitt, of Sydney. He was for some
time member for East Maitland in the Legislative Assembly of New
South Wales, and was afterwards twice elected for Monaro. Having
joined the Dibbs Ministry as Secretary for Public Works, on Oct.
7th, 1885, he was defeated at Camden, and resigned office on the
31st of the same month.</p>

daughter of John Campbell, a cousin of Thomas Campbell the poet,
was born at Ludlow, in Shropshire, on July 18th, 1813, and educated
under the celebrated Pestalozzi, and afterwards at Eton. He
matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, in 1831, and graduated B.A.
in 1837, taking his M.A. degree in 1839. After spending seven years
in Germany and Italy, he was incorporated M.A. of St. Peter's
College, Cambridge, ordained deacon in 1847, priest in 1848;
appointed Head Master of King Edward's School, Southampton, in
1851, D.D. of Cambridge in 1852, Head Master of the Birmingham and
Edgbaston Proprietary School in 1854; received from the University
of Leyden the degree of Doctor Literarum Honoris Causâ in 1860; was
appointed Examiner in Classics to the University of London in 1863,
and in 1867 First Professor of Classics and Logic in the University
of Sydney. Dr. Badham was one of the greatest Greek scholars of his
time, and had a wide acquaintance with modern languages; but he
failed, from faults of temper and lack of method, from gaining the
recognition in England to which his talents would have otherwise
entitled him. He is said to have known all Greek poetry by heart,
and is famed for his scholarly editions of several Greek dramas,
and of the "Philibus," the "Euthydemus," and "Laches" of Plato. He
died in Sydney on Feb. 26th, 1884.</p>

in pastoral pursuits at Kapunda. He was a member of the first
entirely nominee Legislative Council, was member for Light in the
mixed Council which replaced it, and also sat in the present Upper
House under responsible government. In the first-named he
distinguished himself by his opposition to Colonel Robe's proposals
for endowing the religious bodies and imposing a royalty on
minerals. He is mainly known as one of the discoverers and original
owners of the Kapunda Copper Mines. He was also the founder of the

was born in Middlesex, England, in 1823, and emigrated to New South
Wales in 1853 as mineralogist to a mining company. In 1870 he was
elected to the Legislative Assembly for the Southern Goldfields,
and was also a member of the Goldfields Committee. When Mr.
Garrett, the Minister of Lands in the Robertson Ministry, resigned
his office, in Feb. 1877, Mr. Baker was appointed to succeed him,
but the Government only held office till March. He was appointed
Secretary for Mines in the next Robertson Administration, in August
of the same year, exchanging that post for the portfolio of Lands
in November, and going out of office with his colleagues in
December. Mr. Baker was again Minister of Mines in the Parkes
Government from Dec. 1878 to August 1881, when he was expelled from
the Assembly on a charge of corrupt conduct.</p>

<p><a name="A70" id="A70"></a><b>Baker, Hon. John</b> Baker, Hon.
John, M.L.C., J.P., F.R.G.S., sometime Premier of South Australia,
was the eldest son of Richard Chaffey Baker, of Lopen,
Somersetshire, and Mary, his wife, daughter of John Anstice, of
South Petherton, Somersetshire. He was born at Ilminster, Somerset,
England, in Dec 1812. He emigrated to Tasmania in early life, and
married on June 7th, 1838, Isabella, second daughter of George
Allan, of Allan Vale, Tasmania. In the same year he visited South
Australia, where he permanently settled about a year later. Soon
after his arrival he concluded an arrangement with the South
Australian Company for the importation of ten thousand sheep from
Tasmania; and from this time entered largely into pastoral
pursuits, and was very successful. Mr. Baker was also concerned in
forming a company to import draught horses from England, and bred
and trained many successful performers on the turf. He was a
director of the Bank of Australasia and of the South Australian
Mining Association, and was the first chairman of the Chamber of
Commerce on its establishment in 1850. He was also a lieut.-colonel
in the South Australian Infantry force, and represented Mount
Barker in the mixed Legislative Council from 1851 to 1856. Whilst a
member of this body he opposed the abolition of State aid to
religion, and supported the proposal for a nominee Upper
House&mdash;in each case unsuccessfully. When responsible
government was inaugurated, in 1857, he was elected to the new
Legislative Council, and retained his seat till his death. He was
Premier and Chief Secretary for eleven days&mdash;viz., from August
21st to Sept. 1st, 1857. The next year he was commissioned by his
fellow-colonists to present an address to Her Majesty the Queen on
the occasion of the marriage of the Princess Royal, and this he did
at a <i>levée</i> at St. James's Palace in March 1859. Shortly
afterwards he returned to South Australia, and died at Morialta on
May 19th, 1872.</p>

<p><a name="A71" id="A71"></a><b>Baker, Hon. Richard Chaffey</b>,
C.M.G., M.L.C., M.A., eldest son of the late John Baker, of

at North Adelaide in 1841, and educated at Eton, and at Trinity
College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. (Mathematical Tripos)
in 1864, and M.A. in 1870. Mr. Baker, who is a member of the legal
firm of Baker &amp; Barlow, of Adelaide, became a student at
Lincoln's Inn in Jan. 1861, and was called to the bar in June 1864.
He entered the Legislative Assembly of South Australia as member
for Barossa in 1868, and represented that constituency till 1871.
He was Attorney-General in the Ministry of the late Captain Hart
from May 1870 to July 1871, when he resigned. He also held office
in Mr. Colton's Cabinet as Minister of Justice and Education from
June 1884 to June 1886. In the latter year Mr. Baker was sent to
England as the representative of the Australian colonies to
negotiate with the Imperial Government, in connection with the
renewal of the expiring mail contracts. He succeeded in obtaining
some important concessions, and was created C.M.G. in 1886, in
recognition of his services. Mr. Baker, who has been a member of
the Legislative Council since 1877, was elected to act as one of
the representatives of South Australia at the Federation Convention
in Sydney in March 1891, and distinguished himself by his
championship of the state rights of the smaller colonies. He was
married at Glenelg, S.A., to Katherine Edith, daughter of Richard
Bowen Colley.</p>

<p><a name="A72" id="A72"></a><b>Baker, Rev. Shirley W.</b>, late
Premier of Tonga, was sent to Tonga in the year 1860 by the
Australian Wesleyan Conference, and remained a missionary for about
twenty years, being head of the mission for the latter half of that
period, a position which he resigned to become adviser to King
George of Tonga and Premier of the Tongan Government. During his
residence in the islands he did much to obtain liberty for the
people, who previously had been simply serfs of the chiefs. Mr.
Baker had also forestalled the doctrine of Henry George many years
before "Progress and Poverty" was written, by nationalising the
lands of Tonga and enabling each taxpayer to claim land sufficient
to assist him in paying his taxes and providing for his family. He
also gave the Tongans their flag, and secured for them in 1875 a
constitution which is still the law of the land, also a judiciary
system embracing police courts and a police force. He compiled a
code of laws, and had roads made through all the islands. Instead
of the meeting of chiefs to manage the affairs of the kingdom, he
gave them a Legislative Assembly, consisting of an equal number of
hereditary chiefs and representatives of the people elected by
ballot, each taxpayer able to read and write having a vote. He also
made education free and compulsory. The public buildings which were
put up under his supervision were highly creditable, and the King's
private church is reckoned one of the finest pieces of architecture
in the South Seas. He also succeeded in getting Tonga acknowledged
as an independent kingdom by England, Germany, and America. During
the latter part of Mr. Baker's administration as Premier of Tonga,
trouble arose between the Government and the Wesleyan Church, owing
chiefly to the fact that the absorption of money for the purposes
of governing the islands caused a great falling off in the annual
collections among the islands for Foreign Missions. After
ineffectual attempts to induce the Australasian Wesleyan Conference
to confer local government upon the Tongan Church, Mr. Baker
established an independent Methodist body under the title of the
"Free Church of Tonga," which drew away the majority of natives
from the orthodox Wesleyan Church. In these islands religion enters
into every relation of life, and the rivalries, political and
religious, grew so intense that a discontented faction made an
attempt to assassinate Mr. Baker whilst he was out driving. His son
and daughter, who occupied seats in the buggy with him, were
severely wounded, but Mr. Baker escaped. The offenders were brought
to trial, some of them executed, and a considerable number banished
for treason against the Government. About this time the
administration of Tonga, Samoa, and other Pacific islands became a
subject of secret international agreements, and through influences
exercised in England Sir John Thurston visited Tonga in a
man-of-war in 1890 and forcibly deported Mr. Baker to Fiji, issuing
an order against his return to Tonga for a period of two years. A
purely native Government, assisted by two European officials in
non-political matters, has since ruled the islands. Mr. Baker
removed to Auckland, N.Z., where he now resides.</p>

<p><a name="A73" id="A73"></a><b>Balfe, John Donellan</b>, son of
James Balfe and Sara Sutherland his wife, daughter of the last Lord
Duffus, was born at Sallybrook, Drumcondra, Ireland, in the year
1816. He was educated at Clongoeswood College, near Dublin,
conducted by Jesuits, where he received a good classical education.
After leaving college he joined the Life Guards, and was stationed
at Windsor for two years. He was one of those detailed to escort
the Queen on her marriage from Windsor Castle to Buckingham Palace.
Mr. Balfe took an active part in the political affairs of Ireland,
and became a prominent member of the Repeal Association under
O'Connell. He was one of the declaimers at Conciliation Hall, and
warmly advocated the redress of Irish grievances. He was also
identified with the Irish confederation, but withdrew from the
party on finding their schemes were wild and visionary, and could
not be attained without a general rising of the peasantry. He was
author of a number of letters on the Landlord and Tenant question
published in the <i>Dublin Evening Post</i> and signed "An Irish
Farmer," and also contributed to a Liverpool journal under the name
of "Peter Carroll, Stonemason." In 1850 he married Mary, daughter
of Terence O'Reilly of Ballybeg, and shortly afterwards emigrated
to Tasmania. Mr. Balfe brought letters of introduction from the
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to Governor Denison, and shortly after
his arrival was appointed Assistant Comptroller General of
Convicts. After three years he resigned his office, and went to
reside on his location at Lisadern, near Port Cygnet, Huon River.
He brought himself into notice as the writer of letters signed
"Bill Shingle," which called attention to the wants of the Huon
district, and also as the author of a series of letters signed
"Dion," in opposition to the aims of the Anti-Transportation
League. On the introduction of responsible government in 1856, he
was elected a member of the House of Assembly for the Franklin
district. He retained his seat in the Assembly, with the exception
of one session, until his death, a period of twenty-four years,
representing successively Franklin, South Launceston, and West
Hobart. Mr. Balfe's speeches were marked by considerable power of
humorous satire, and his ability and force as a debater made him
for many years a prominent figure in Tasmanian politics. He was at
various periods editor of several Tasmanian newspapers. He died at
Hobart on December 13th, 1880. An account of his trial for
assaulting Mr. T. G. Gregson was published in Tasmania in 1853.</p>

<p><a name="A74" id="A74"></a><b>Balfour, Hon. James</b>, M.L.C.,
son of John Balfour, a merchant of Leith, was born in 1830 in
Edinburgh, and educated at the Edinburgh Academy and the
University. After some commercial experience in London, from 1849
to 1852, he went to Melbourne as the representative of Messrs.
Matheson, of Lombard Street, to the firm of James Henty &amp; Co.
In 1854 he opened a branch house of the latter firm at Geelong. He
visited England in 1857-8, resigned his position in Geelong in
1863, and in 1866 entered the Assembly as member for East Bourke.
He was for three years one of the Commissioners of Education prior
to the organisation of the department under a responsible minister.
In 1868 he made another visit to England, prior to which he
resigned his seat in the Assembly, and returned to Australia and
entered the Legislative Council in 1874, being re-elected for the
south-eastern province on Aug. 17th, 1880. He made another trip
home in 1878, and on his return established the firm of Balfour,
Elliott, &amp; Co., which was made into a limited company in 1887.

<p><a name="A75" id="A75"></a><b>Ballance, Hon. John</b>, M.H.R.,
Premier of New Zealand, was born at Glenavy, in the county of
Antrim, Ireland, on March 27th, 1839, his father, Samuel Ballance,
being a tenant farmer on Lord Hertford's estate. He received his
preliminary education at the National School, but at the age of
fourteen left his father's farm to be apprenticed to an ironmonger.
This line of life took him later on to Birmingham, where he
remained eight years, profiting in every way by the intellectual
progressive life of the great manufacturing centre. While following
his business he found time to attend the evening classes in the
Midland Institute for the purpose of completing his education.
Earnestly bent on self-culture, he took part in debating societies,
and contributed largely to the press. At the age of twenty-seven he
determined to emigrate, and, sailing for New Zealand, arrived at
Wellington in August 1866. He at once proceeded to Wanganui with
the intention of engaging in sheep-farming, an occupation which he
had been led to believe was an easy way of making money without
much capital. On this point he was soon undeceived, and he then
opened a jeweller's shop of the better class, but losing money in
this enterprise, he promptly abandoned it and started a newspaper
under the name of the <i>Wanganui Herald</i>, Of this paper Mr.
Ballance was both proprietor and editor, and up to the present time
he has continued to be its guiding spirit. As is usual with newly
established newspapers in young communities, the <i>Wanganui
Herald</i> had many initial difficulties to overcome; but in the
end its founder's energies were rewarded, and his "daily" became
recognised throughout the colony as one of the best organs of
public opinion. Mr. Ballance had soon achieved a reputation as an
able and incisive writer; but it was not till he had surprised a
Wanganui meeting by an unlooked-for speech that his qualities as a
public speaker became appreciated. He contested the Egmont seat in
1873, in the interests of the Stafford Ministry, his opponents
being the late W. S. Moorhouse and Sir Harry Atkinson. Although
considered by his friends practically safe, he retired in favour of
the latter candidate on his pledging himself to support Sir Edward
Stafford. He was elected for Wanganui in 1875 on the Abolition (of
provinces) ticket, having taken for many years a prominent part in
local politics in opposition to the provincial system, then in
existence. He marked his first session by introducing a bill to
enable municipalities to raise loans by vote of the ratepayers on
security of a special rate without the necessity of permissory
legislation in each case. This important measure passed the House,
but was rejected in the Council by a narrow majority; and in the
following session it was embodied in the Municipal Corporations
Bill by Sir Julius Vogel, who freely acknowledged his indebtedness
to the author of the scheme. The measure finally became law, and
was found to work admirably. In the session of 1877 Mr. Ballance
moved an amendment to the Native Land Court Bill, against free
trade in native lands, and the bill was ultimately withdrawn by the
Government. Throughout that session he supported the newly formed
Grey Ministry, refusing, however, to accept a portfolio whilst the
Cabinet was being formed. Shortly after the termination of the
session, the Ministry again pressing office upon him, and Sir
George Grey himself soliciting his assistance, Mr. Ballance
accepted the post of Minister of Education in Jan. 1878, which he
exchanged for that of Colonial Treasurer in July of the same year;
but in June 1879 he resigned rather than comply with what he
regarded as the arbitrary methods of the Premier. At the general
election in the same year he stood for Wanganui, and defeated Sir
William Fox, Messrs. Ballance and Bryce, the late leader of the
Opposition, being the two successful candidates. During the
successive sessions of 1879, 1880, and 1881 he took a very active
part in opposition to the Hall and Whitaker Ministries. At the
general election in Dec. 1881 he stood for Wanganui, and was
defeated by W. H. Watt, but by a majority of only four. At the
general election of 1884 he was elected by a majority of two to one
over Messrs. Watt and George Hutchinson, and at the general
election of 1887 by a similar majority over Mr. G. Carson. He was
returned again for Wanganui at the general election of 1890, but by
a greatly reduced majority. In Sept. 1884 Mr. Ballance joined the
Stout-Vogel administration as Native Minister and Minister for
Defence and Lands, and retained office till the retirement of that
Ministry in Oct. 1887. In the following year he was formally chosen
as leader of the Opposition; and he became Premier, Colonial
Treasurer, and Commissioner of Customs on the resignation of Sir
Harry Atkinson's Government in Jan. 1891. Outside of politics Mr.
Ballance has done the colony good service. In 1868, when the Maori
insurgents under Titokowaru were ravaging the district, Mr.
Ballance helped to raise the Wanganui Cavalry and took his place in
the ranks, but was immediately elected Cornet of the corps, which
afterwards did good service in the field. He was, however, removed
from his military position for having contributed to his paper some
criticisms on the campaign which gave umbrage to the Government.
Mr. Ballance was the author of the scheme for returning to the
local bodies one-third of the land revenue derived from deferred
payments, having introduced it into the Land Bill of 1877, when it
was before the Waste Lands Committee; and the principle has since
been extended to the perpetual lease system. Soon after first
taking office in 1878, he announced that the Government would
introduce a measure conferring the residential franchise, virtually
manhood suffrage, this being the first announcement of the kind
ever made in any of the colonies. As Colonial Treasurer in 1878 he
introduced a land tax, and carried it into law. It was, however,
repealed by the Atkinson Ministry in the following year. In the
Stout-Vogel Ministry Mr. Ballance introduced and put in practice
the village homestead system, under which a thousand families were
placed on the land in eighteen months. He also inaugurated the
policy by which a large military force to overawe the natives was
got rid of, and the Maori people brought under the ordinary civil
law, a policy which proved completely successful. As Defence
Minister he fortified the principal ports and organised a colonial
military force known as the Permanent Militia. As Native Minister
he succeeded in bringing about a better understanding between the
two races than had existed for years, especially in the so-called
"King Country." In the second session of 1891, having formed a
strong Government, he introduced and carried the various policy
Bills, the principles of which the country had affirmed at the
previous general election. He is a strong advocate of a closer
alliance with the mother country, holding that there is already a
system of imperial federation which may be developed&mdash;that an
Imperial Council of Advice in London should be the nucleus of an
Imperial Parliament&mdash;and that the colony should share in
proportion to population and wealth in the defence of the empire.
He is opposed to New Zealand being part of an Australasian
Federation on the broad ground that the conditions are dissimilar,
and that autonomy would ultimately be destroyed. In May 1870 Mr.
Ballance married Ellen, daughter of the late David Anderson, of
Wellington.</p>

<p><a name="A77" id="A77"></a><b>Barker, Right Rev. Frederic</b>,
D.D., second Bishop of Sydney, was the son of the late Rev. John
Barker, Incumbent of Baslow, in Derbyshire. He was born in 1808,
and educated at Grantham School and Jesus College, Cambridge, where
he graduated B.A. in 1829. He was ordained in 1831, and was
subsequently incumbent of Upton, in Cheshire, Edgehill, near
Liverpool, and of his native parish of Baslow. After the death of
Dr. Broughton, the first Bishop of Sydney, he was selected by the
Archbishop of Canterbury to succeed him in his episcopate, and as
Metropolitan of the Province of Australia. His consecration took
place in Nov. 1854, and he arrived in Sydney in May 1855. For some
time previously the project of introducing Synodical Church
Government had been before the Church, and after the passing of the
Grants for Public Worship Prohibition Act, the organisation so much
desired by the clergy and laity was at length established, the
first synod of the diocese of Sydney assembling on Dec. 5th, 1866,
and Bishop Barker, by the constitutions of the Church, becoming its
President. The diocese of Sydney made great progress under his
care, and he thrice visited England in the promotion of its
interests. When State aid was abolished statutory provision was
made for the retention of Bishop Barker's stipend of £2,000 per
annum. Under his primacy no less than seven new sees were
established in Australia, viz., Perth [Western Australia] in 1856;
Brisbane [Queensland] in 1859; Goulburn [New South Wales] in 1863;
Grafton and Armidale [New South Wales] in 1866; Bathurst [New South
Wales] in 1869; Ballarat [Victoria] in 1875; and North Queensland
in 1878. His first wife died in Sydney in 1876, and he married,
secondly, Mary Jane, elder daughter of Edward Woods of London, and
having had a paralytic seizure, he paid a fourth visit to Europe in
1881 to recuperate his health, but died after an illness of four
weeks at San Remo on April 6th, 1882. He was buried at Baslow.</p>

<p><a name="A78" id="A78"></a><b>Barker, John</b>, sometime Clerk
of the Parliaments, Victoria, is the eldest son of the late John
Barker and Mary Anne, his wife, and was born at Aylesbury,
Buckinghamshire. He emigrated to Port Phillip (now Victoria) in
1840, after entering himself for the bar at Lincoln's Inn, and
engaged in pastoral pursuits with his brother Edward, afterwards a
well-known physician in Melbourne. Revisiting England, he was
called to the bar in 1843; and in 1844 married Susanna, daughter of
Richard Hodgkinson, of Morton Grange, Nottingham. He returned to
Port Phillip in Nov. 1844, accompanied by his brother William (who
subsequently practised as a surgeon at Emerald Hill, Melbourne). In
the next year he was appointed a magistrate, and in August 1849 was
one of the Commissioners under the Disputed Boundaries Act, having
the Hamilton district assigned to him. Mr. Barker, who was admitted
to the Victorian bar in Nov. 1851, was in October of that year, on
the separation of Port Phillip from New South Wales and its
formation into the colony of Victoria, appointed Clerk of the
Legislative Council then constituted, and successfully performed
the difficult task of inaugurating its procedure. When responsible
government came into operation in 1856, Mr. Barker was offered the
choice of the clerkship of the new Upper or Lower Chamber. He
accepted the latter, and remained Clerk of the Assembly until April
1882, when he was appointed Clerk of the Legislative Council and
Clerk of Parliaments, a post which he resigned in 1891. He died on
Nov. 15th of that year.</p>

Ross-shire, an eminent West India merchant in London, where his son
was born in 1815. He was educated at Bruce Castle School,
Tottenham, and went into business. From April 1845 to Feb. 1849 he
was M.P. for Leominster, as a supporter of Sir Robert Peel. In Dec.
1848 he was appointed Governor and commander-in-chief of British
Guiana (where he owned estates), and where as Governor he advocated
the introduction of coolies and Chinese as labourers. He was
Governor of Jamaica from 1853 to 1856, being created K.C.B. in the
former year. In Dec. 1856 he was appointed Governor of Victoria in
succession to Sir Charles Hotham, and held that position till Sept.
1863. During his government of Victoria constitutional questions of
some delicacy cropped up in connection with the initiatory stages
of responsible government in that colony, but on the whole his
<i>régime</i> was popular and respected. His first wife, who was
the daughter of J. F. Timins, of Hatfield House, died in 1857, a
few months after his arrival in Victoria, where in 1860 he married
the only daughter of Sir Thomas Simson Pratt, K.C.B. In 1863 he was
appointed Governor of Mauritius, and was Governor and High
Commissioner at the Cape from 1870 to 1876. Meanwhile he was

started the <i>Advertiser</i> and <i>Chronicle</i> newspapers,
entering the Legislative Assembly in the same year as member for
East Torrens. Of the two journals mentioned he was editor and part
proprietor with the late Mr. Thomas King down to the time of his
death. In March 1861 he was returned to the Legislative Council,

again returned to Sydney, but resigned his see, for urgent family
reasons, in May 1889, when he became Assistant Bishop to Bishop
Thorold of Rochester. In 1890 this appointment having lapsed, on
the translation of Bishop Thorold to the see of Winchester, he

1813, and after being at a military school at Hall's Place, Bexley,
Kent, returned to Ireland, where he entered at Trinity College,
Dublin, and graduated B.A. in 1838. In the same year he was called
to the Irish bar, and emigrated to Australia in the following year,
landing at Sydney, where he only remained a few weeks before
proceeding to Melbourne, the capital of what was then known as the
Port Phillip District of New South Wales. Here he entered on the
practice of his profession with much success until 1842, when he
was appointed Commissioner of the Court of Bequests, then the
second judicial office in the future colony of Victoria. Mr. Barry
became Solicitor-General in 1851, when separation from New South
Wales was achieved, with a seat in the Legislative and Executive
Councils. In January of the following year he was made a judge of
the Supreme Court. In 1855 Sir Redmond was appointed First
Chancellor of the University of Melbourne, and in the following
year President of the Trustees of the Public Library, both of which
positions he held till his death. Of each of these institutions he
was regarded as the Father, the success of the National Gallery
being mainly attributable, as in the case of the Library, to his
energy in developing the collection. Sir Redmond, who was Acting
Chief Justice in the absence of Sir William à Beckett, and who
administered the government of the colony in the simultaneous
absence of the Governor and Chief Justice in the winter of 1876 to
1877, was knighted in 1860, and created K.C.M.G. in 1877. He was
appointed a Commissioner for Victoria at the International
Exhibition held in Lon- in 1862, and received the degree of LL.D.
from his Alma Mater in 1876; the University of Melbourne
subsequently investing him with the degrees of M. A. and LL.B. In

He was educated at the Sydney Grammar School, and matriculated at
the university at the age of sixteen, receiving a special prize
from the Senate for proficiency in classics. During the second and
third years of his university course he held successively the
Lithgow and Cooper scholarships, and graduated in 1868 with first
class classical honours, and the university prize of £25. In 1870
he took his M.A. degree at Sydney University, and is a member of
the Senate of that body. He was called to the colonial bar in 1871.
He contested the seat in the Assembly given to the university in
1877 against Mr. (now Sir William) Windeyer, but was defeated by
six votes. Practising his profession, he was a Crown Prosecutor
till 1879, when Mr. Windeyer retired, and he again contested the
seat for the university, beating Dr. Renwick by a large majority.
Subsequently Mr. Barton represented Wellington in the Legislative
Assembly, and was Speaker of the Lower House from Jan. 1883 to Jan.
1887. In the following February he was nominated to the Legislative
Council, and from Jan. to March 1889 held a seat in the Dibbs
Ministry as Attorney-General and representative of the Government
in the Upper House. Mr. Barton, who is a Q.C., announced his
adhesion to protectionist views in 1889. He was one of the
representatives of New South Wales at the Federation Convention
held in Sydney in March 1891. Mr. Barton is a strong supporter of
the Commonwealth Bill, which he assisted Sir Samuel Griffith in
drafting, and regards Protection in New South Wales as occupying a
secondary place to intercolonial federation. In 1891 Mr. Barton
resigned his seat in the Legislative Council, and was returned to
the Assembly for East Sydney. On the formation of the Dibbs
Ministry in Oct. 1801, Mr. Barton accepted the office of

Holyoake</b>, second son of Sir John Edward George Bayley, Bart.,
and brother of Sir John Robert Laurie Emilias Laurie, Bart., was
born on May 6th, 1827, and educated at Eton and Trinity College,
Cambridge. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in May
1850, and married, in May 1852, Isabella, daughter of Anthony
Mactier, of Durris House, Kincardineshire, who died in April 1860.
He emigrated to Australia, and was Attorney-General of New South
Wales in the second Cowper Government from March to Oct. 1859, in
succession to Mr. (afterwards Judge) Lutwyche. His appointment gave
great offence to the legal fraternity, as he had been but a short
time in the colony; and Mr. Deniehy moved a resolution censuring
his nomination. It was not, however, carried. In 1866 Mr. Bayley
was appointed Advocate-General at Bombay, and Puisne Judge in 1869.
This position he still holds.</p>

<p><a name="A95" id="A95"></a><b>Beach, William</b>, the well-known
New South Wales oarsman, was born in Surrey, England, and was
beaten by Trickett, the then champion sculler of the world, on the
Parramatta river on July 28th, 1883. The weather was rough on this
occasion, but under more favourable conditions Beach beat Trickett
in three successive matches. On Jan. 26th, 1884, Trickett again
beat Beach on the Parramatta; but as a foul occurred the race was
rowed over again, with the same result, Beach being unwell. On
April 12th following the positions were again reversed, with great
apparent ease by Beach, who defeated Hanlan, the Canadian sculler,
on August 16th of the same year over the Parramatta champion course
in 21 minutes 17 seconds. In the next year Beach defeated Clifford,
repeated his defeat of Hanlan, and also vanquished Neil Matterson,
a young sculler of his own colony. On March 27th, 1886, Beach
sailed for England, and arrived at Plymouth on May 17th. He at once
accepted a challenge from Hanlan, but nothing coming of it, he
challenged the world. Beach then won the first prize of £1200 in
the International Sweepstake on the Thames, defeating Bubear, Lee,
Teemer, and others. On Sept. 18th he rowed Gaudaur on the Thames
for £1000 and the championship of the world, and won the day after
a tough struggle. On Sept. 25th he defeated Wallace Ross for a
similar stake, and soon afterwards left for Australia, arriving in
Sydney on Dec. 3rd, 1886. Hanlan followed him to Australia, and
they met on the Nepean, when Beach's superiority was again
asserted. He then wished to relinquish the championship, and on
Peter Kemp challenging him resigned it to him, declining to row
him. He subsequently kept a public house in Sydney.</p>

in Lancashire in 1821, and was educated at Trinity College,
Cambridge, where he took his degree in 1852. In the same year he
went out to the Canterbury settlement in New Zealand, then newly
founded, and set up as a station-holder in conjunction with his
brother John. When Canterbury was constituted a province Mr. Bealey
was one of the members for Christchurch in the Provincial Council,
and in 1863 was elected Superintendent. The harbour works at Port
Lyttelton were constructed under his official <i>régime</i>, and he
was a warm advocate for the erection of the breakwater which
contributes so much to the safety of the harbour. At the close of
his term of office he returned to England.</p>

with Mr. W. J. Cooper. He was afterwards a student at Edinburgh
University, at Paris, and at Guy's Hospital. He commenced his
medical career as regimental surgeon in the Mediterranean, and with
the Turkish contingent in the Crimean war. After the campaign he
made several trips to America, and ultimately went to Melbourne,
where in 1858 he became assistant to Dr. John Maund, at whose death
he succeeded to his practice. In 1860 he was appointed surgeon to
the Melbourne Hospital, surgeon to the Royal Victorian Artillery,
and was elected a member of the Royal Society of Victoria. He was
again elected surgeon to the hospital and banquetted at the town
hall in 1875, and was subsequently re-elected despite the strenuous
opposition of a large section of the medical profession. In 1878
Dr. Beaney visited England with a semi-official commission from the
Berry Government to report on medical matters. In 1883, after a
severe contest, he was elected to the Legislative Council for the
North Yarra Province, and was re-elected for a period of six years,
in 1885, when he defeated the Hon. James Munro, the late Premier of
Victoria. Dr. Beaney was the author of several medical works,
including "Contributions to Conservative Surgery." He was
munificent in his donations to public institutions in his native
place, and offered various medical prizes. He died in Melbourne on
June 30th, 1891, bequeathing by his will £10,000 to his native
place.</p>

<p><a name="A99" id="A99"></a><b>Bell, Hon. Sir Francis Dillon</b>,
K.C.M.G., C.B., sometime Agent-General for New Zealand, second and
eldest surviving son of Edward Bell, of Hornsey (who died in 1864),
by Fanny, daughter of Rev. J. Matthews, of Cirencester (she died in
1870), comes of a family, which, through Robert Barclay, of Urie,
the Quaker apologist, claims descent from the blood royal of
England. He was born on Oct 8th, 1822, and educated in France. In
1839 he entered the service of the New Zealand Company, and for a
time was assistant secretary, and afterwards secretary, in London.
He emigrated to New Zealand shortly after the settlement of
Wellington and New Plymouth, and was agent of the Company till 1850
at Nelson, Auckland, New Plymouth, and elsewhere. In 1848 he was
called to the Legislative Council of New Minister, but resigned in
1850. In 1846 he was made J.P., and in 1851, upon the surrender of
the charter of the New Zealand Company, he became Commissioner of
Crown Lands. In 1853 he entered the Provincial Council of
Wellington, where he remained for three years; and in 1854 he was
called to the Legislative Council and held office without portfolio
from June 30th to July 11th, under the system of semi-responsible
government which then obtained. Mr. Bell was Colonial Treasurer in
the first responsible ministry (formed by Mr. Sewell and himself),
from May 7th to May 20th, 1856. In the same year he was appointed
Commissioner of Land Claims, which office he held till 1862. He was
Colonial Treasurer (August 6th to 21st, 1862), Minister for Native
Affairs (August 6th, 1862, to Oct. 30th, 1863), and Commissioner of
Customs (August 7th to 21st, 1862), in the Domett Ministry. Of the
Fox Ministry he was a member without portfolio from July 2nd, 1869,
to August 14th, 1871. It was, however, in his capacity of
Commissioner of Land Claims, from 1856 to 1862, and as Special
Commissioner on the west coast of the North Island from 1879 to
1881, that he rendered the most eminent services to the colony. In
1862 he went with Mr. Gorst to Australia, and succeeded in raising
a force of military settlers to plant in the disturbed Waikato
district. In 1864 he removed to Otago, and in the following year
was elected to the Provincial Council. In 1866 he was elected once
more to Parliament for the constituency of Mataura. In 1869 he went
to England, in company with Dr. Featherston, on a special
commission to raise fresh forces for the colony, and to obtain the
imperial guarantee to a loan of £1,000,000 for immigration and
public works. In this latter difficult task the commissioners were
entirely successful. He returned to Otago in 1871, and re-entering
parliament was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives,
which office he held for five years. In 1873 he was made a Knight
Bachelor, and in 1877 was nominated to the Legislative Council. In
1881 Sir Francis succeeded Sir Julius Vogel as Agent-General for
New Zealand, and held the position till the autumn of 1891, when he
returned to New Zealand. It is only just to say that during the
whole ten years of his <i>régime</i> he was not only a most able
and single-minded representative of his own colony, but was
recognised by the agents-general of the Australian colonies as
their leader in all representations to the Colonial Office on the
complicated subject of Australasian relations in the Western
Pacific, including the annexation of New Guinea, the New Hebrides
embroglio, and the Recedivist influx. At the Colonial and Indian
Exhibition in 1886 he was Executive Commissioner, and in 1889 was
not only Executive Commissioner for New Zealand at the Paris
Exhibition, but was also a member of the Mansion House Committee.
For his services in this connection the French Government bestowed
upon him the Commandership of the Legion of Honour. In 1887 he was
delegate to the Colonial Conference. Sir Francis Bell was created
K.C.M.G. in 1881, and C.B. in 1886. He married on April 2nd, 1849,
Margaret, daughter of A. Hort. In 1891 he received the thanks of
the Legislative Council for his services. He returned to New
Zealand in Nov. 1891, but left again for England in April 1892,
where Lady Bell died on June 12th, 1892.</p>

North-West Province. In 1886 he opened a business in Melbourne. He
accepted office without portfolio in the Gillies-Deakin Government
on April 20th, 1886, and acted as Minister of Defence during Sir
James Lorimer's absence in England, in 1887. He also assisted Mr.
Dow in discharging the duties of Minister of Water Supply during
Mr. Deakin's attendance at the Colonial Conference in London in
that year. On the death of Sir James Lorimer, in Sept. 1889, he was
appointed Minister of Defence, and retired with his colleagues in

Herbert) after the separation of Queensland from New South Wales,
succeeding the late Mr. Moffatt. This post he continued to hold
till July 1866, for the last six months of the time under the
Premiership of the late Mr. Macalister, in whose second ministry he
was Secretary for Public Lands from August 1866 to August 1867. Sir
Joshua was again Treasurer in the Palmer Ministry from March 1871
till he resigned with his colleagues in Jan. 1874. He married in
1862 Margaret Miller, daughter of William McTaggart D'Orsey, M.D.,
who survived him. Sir Joshua, who administered the government of
Queensland during the absence on leave of Sir Arthur Kennedy from
March to Nov. 1880, died in December of the following year, when he
was succeeded in the Presidency of the Legislative Council by Sir
Arthur Palmer. He had just previously been created K.C.M.G.</p>

scientific journals. In 1832 he revisited New South Wales to
investigate the manners, habits and anatomy of the
<i>Monotremata</i>, and the natural history of the colony in
general. After visiting Java, Singapore and China, he published his
"Wanderings in New South Wales" in 1834, and finally settled in

a medical man, was able to add materially to the knowledge of the
natural history of New South Wales. He was the first to discover
the Nautilus in a living state, and sent a specimen to Professor
Owen. In 1860 he published "Gatherings of a Naturalist."</p>

father in business as a market gardener at Brighton, Vict., he was
elected to the Moorabbin Shire Council in 1862, and was President
in 1868. In 1871 he first achieved general notoriety by opposing
Mr. (now Chief Justice) Higinbotham for the Brighton seat in the
Legislative Assembly. To the amazement of every one, he was
successful, and has ever since represented that electorate. Though
strongly opposed to the last McCulloch Government, Mr. Bent was not
a supporter of the Berry party, being indeed a consistent
Freetrader. At the first dissolution in 1880 the Conservatives,
under Mr. Service, secured a majority; and Mr. Bent was included in
the Cabinet formed by that gentleman in March 1880, with the
portfolio of Public Works. The Reform Bill of the Ministry proved
distasteful to the country on the appeal to the constituencies made
in June 1880, and Mr. Bent retired with his colleagues in the
following August. Mr. Bent was a highly potential member of the
O'Loghlen Government as Minister of Railways from July 1881 to
March 1883. In Oct. 1887, on the retirement of the late Mr. Lalor,
Mr. Bent was a candidate for the Speakership of the Legislative
Assembly, but was defeated by Sir M. H. Davies by one vote. On the

was educated at St. Andrews University. He arrived in New South
Wales in July 1836, and proceeded to the estate of his elder
brother, Dr. Alexander Berry, at Coolangatta, which he managed in
conjunction with another brother, John, for eleven years, and after
the letter's death carried on the concern alone until 1873, when
Dr. Alexander Berry died and devised the whole of his property to
his brother David, who followed the system of cultivating and
fencing a large portion of his land whilst the remainder was leased
out in farms of varying size on peculiar and unusually profitable
terms. Mr. Berry died, at the age of ninety-seven, on Sept. 22nd,
1889, and by his will bequeathed £100,000 to his <i>alma mater</i>,
St. Andrews University, and a like sum to found a hospital in the
Shoalhaven district of New South Wales.</p>

<p><a name="A115" id="A115"></a><b>Berry, Hon. Sir Graham</b>,
K.C.M.G., Treasurer of Victoria, is the son of the late Benjamin
Berry, of Twickenham, and Clara Graham, his wife. He was born at
Twickenham on August 28th, 1822, and emigrated to Victoria in 1852.
In 1860 Mr. Berry purchased the <i>Collingwood Observer</i>, which
he conducted for a considerable period. The same year Mr. Berry was
elected to the Victorian Assembly under somewhat exceptional
circumstances. A vacancy had occurred in East Melbourne through the
death of the sitting member, and Mr. E. Cohen and Mr. Patrick
O'Brien were contesting the vacancy, when suddenly a dissolution
was granted, thus necessitating a dual election. In order to save
expense it was agreed between the candidates that some one outside
the colony should be nominated for the prior vacancy, and that the
real contest would take place on the second election. This
arrangement did not commend itself to the constituency, and at the
nomination Mr. Berry's name was proposed, when, there being no
other candidate, he was declared elected. At the general election
Mr. Berry transferred his attentions to Collingwood, where he beat
Mr. Langton, and was returned as an advanced Liberal and
Protectionist. In 1864 he was re-elected for the same constituency.
In the meantime Sir James McCulloch had come into office, with Mr.
(now Sir) George Verdon as Treasurer. The latter gentleman proposed
the imposition of <i>ad valorem</i> duties, mainly on articles
producible in the colony; and the budget was thus a step in the
direction of that full policy of protection to native industries
which was to be so astonishingly developed under succeeding
administrations. Of that policy Mr. Berry had from his first entry
into political life been a firm and consistent advocate, leading a
small section of the House, who made the question their <i>pièce de
résistance</i>. He accordingly welcomed the proposals of the
Ministry as a promising instalment, and accorded them a cordial
support in the great constitutional struggle which ensued on the
tacking of the Customs Bill to the Appropriation Bill&mdash;a
device resorted to in order to force the measure through the Upper
House, by whom, however, it was set aside, thus leaving the
Government without means to pay the salaries of the public servants
and other Governmental expenses. In this extremity the Government
had recourse to the device of borrowing from a bank, and confessing
judgments, which is fully described in the notice of Sir James
McCulloch. This device found no favour with Mr. Berry, who had
previously stumped the country on behalf of the Ministerial tack;
and he lost no time in denouncing any payments except by the
ordinary constitutional procedure, on the ground that the action
taken by the Government was an absolute giving way on the part of
the Assembly, and certain to lead to discomfiture. The country went
wholly with Sir James McCulloch, and, at the dissolution, Mr. Berry
was badly beaten, both at Collingwood and for the Murray Boroughs,
remaining out of Parliament for three years. In 1866 he joined with
others in purchasing the <i>Geelong Register</i>, with which the
<i>Advertiser</i> was shortly amalgamated, and went to reside in
that town. Not long afterwards he unsuccessfully contested South
Grant against Mr. Stutt; but in 1868 was returned for Geelong West,
having in the meantime performed the active duties of editor of the
<i>Advertiser</i>, and written most of the leading articles. Mr.
Berry first acceded to ministerial office as Treasurer in the
short-lived Macpherson Government in 1870. Beyond making his first
budget speech, Mr. Berry had, however, very little opportunity of
distinguishing himself, his chief being promptly displaced by Sir
James McCulloch. In 1871 Mr. Berry was again returned for Geelong
West, and entered the Ministry of Sir Charles Gavan Duffy as
Treasurer and Minister of Customs in June of that year. He,
however, resigned the latter post in the following November, and
finally left the Ministry in May 1872. In 1874 he was again
returned for Geelong West. In the meantime the Francis and Kerferd
Ministries intervened, the defeat of Mr. Service's budget In the
latter Government bringing Mr. Berry into power for the first time,
as Premier and Chief Secretary of Victoria, in August 1875. The
introduction of a land tax caused the speedy defeat of the new
Government. Mr. Berry thereupon applied for a dissolution, which
was refused him by the Acting Governor (Sir William Stawell), and
Sir James McCulloch once more returned to power. Mr. Berry,
however, holding that he had been unconstitutionally refused an
appeal to the people, determined to block all Government business,
with a view of forcing on a general election, his contention being
that the majority in the Assembly were a decided minority in the
country. He and his followers now received the sobriquet of
"stonewallers"; and, whilst they blocked business in the House,
stumped the country with extraordinary perseverance and success,
Mr. Berry's platform deliverances exciting great enthusiasm
throughout the colony. Sir James McCulloch strove to put down
Parliamentary obstruction by the imposition of a species of
closure, which became famous under the designation of the "Iron
Hand." By this means he warded off a dissolution until Parliament
had run the statutory time. At the general election which ensued
the tables were, however, completely turned, only a meagre remnant
of his following being returned, the polls giving Mr. Berry an
overwhelming majority. Sir James McCulloch having resigned, the
popular idol was sent for, and at once opened negotiations with Mr.
Service, who had assumed an attitude of independent hostility to
the McCulloch Government, and with several leading members of the
Opposition who had not been included in the previous
Administration. They, however, all declined his overtures, though
Mr. Service for a considerable time observed towards him a friendly
neutrality; and Mr. Berry was obliged to be content with the
<i>materiel</i> of his first Cabinet, with the exception of Mr.
Munro, who refused office. Had the gentlemen to whom Mr. Berry
primarily applied found it compatible with their sentiments to
respond to the invitation, it is probable that most of the acerbity
which characterised the proceedings of the next three years would
never have been aroused&mdash;certainly it would never have reached
the same height. It is beyond our scope to detail the particulars
of the struggle which followed. A land tax, having for its object
to restrict the accumulation of land in the hands of individuals,
was carried through Parliament; but the inclusion of payment of
members in the ordinary Appropriation Bill, instead of its being
dealt with by a special bill, brought on the storm which had
previously evaporated in protests, the Council setting it aside,
whereupon a deadlock ensued, which lasted from May 1877 to April
1878, when a compromise was arrived at which saved the dignity of
both parties. It was during this struggle that the dismissals of
the civil servants took place on what has become memorable as Black
Wednesday, Mr. Berry declining to consider any arrangements for the
borrowing of funds similar to those which he had condemned when
adopted by Sir James McCulloch. Though the storm was somewhat
allayed, Mr. Berry was so strongly impressed with the necessity of
reorganising the constitution, with a view of defining the powers
of the respective Houses, and of preventing deadlocks by providing
a legislative safety-valve, that he introduced a measure containing
the novel expedient of the <i>plébiscite</i>, combined with a
system of nominated representatives. This measure was naturally
repudiated by the Upper Chamber, involving as it did their complete
obliteration; and in the winter of 1878-9 Mr. Berry undertook his
famous mission to England known as "the Embassy," in conjunction
with Mr. C. H. Pearson, with the view of inducing the British
Government to bring a bill into the Imperial Parliament having for
its object the reform of the Constitution of Victoria. The
delegates had several interviews with Sir Michael Hicks Beach, the
then Colonial Secretary, and obtained from him much good advice and
a modified promise to interfere in case the deadlock proved
irremediable after a further recourse to the country. With this
small measure of comfort Mr. Berry had to be content, and returned
to Victoria, where Sir B. O'Loghlen had been Acting Premier during
his absence. One substantial result of his visit to London was the
successful floating of a loan of £3,000,000 on behalf of the
colony, which was rendered more remarkable from the fact that Mr.
Berry insisted on fixing a higher minimum than the banks advised,
and that the political disturbances of the preceding year had
created feelings of distrust as to the stability of Victoria in the
minds of English capitalists. In 1880 Mr. Berry reintroduced his
Reform Bill, and then appealed to the country, in accordance with
the advice of Sir M. Hicks Beach. The Ministry were, however,
placed in a minority, and Mr. Service acceded to power in March
1880. He also, being impressed with the necessity for a substantial
constitutional change, introduced a Reform Bill, which also proving
abortive, he retired from office in August of the same year, when
Mr. Berry once more assumed the Premiership, and succeeded in
coming to a compromise with the Council on the basis of a Reform
Bill, which considerably reduced the franchise and qualification
for members of the Upper Chamber. Mr. Berry was subsequently
defeated by a combination of Conservatives with the dissatisfied
Liberals, and resigned office, when Sir Bryan O'Loghlen took the
reins, and continued as Premier on sufferance until after the
general election in Feb. 1883, when he and most of his small
following lost their seats, and a House was returned in which the
Conservatives, led by Mr. Service, and the Liberals, led by Mr.
Berry, were almost equal in strength. To obviate a continuance of
weak ministries and merely factious warfare, the Service-Berry
coalition was formed, and conferred incalculable benefits on
Victoria, until the voluntary termination of its tenure by the
resignation of Messrs. Service and Berry in Feb. 1886. In the
following March Mr. Berry quitted Victoria to take up the
Agent-Generalship of the colony in succession to Mr. Murray Smith.
He was also appointed Executive Commissioner to the Colonial and
Indian Exhibition, for his services in connection with which he was
created K.C.M.G. Sir Graham Berry was one of the representatives of
Victoria at the Colonial Conference held in London in 1887, and
took a prominent part in its proceedings. For his services in
connection with the Paris Exhibition of 1889 he was appointed a
Commander of the Legion of Honour by the French Government. Sir
Graham married, in 1869, a daughter of John B. Evans, of Victoria.
In Feb. 1889 Sir Graham Berry was reappointed Agent-General for a
further term of three years, and the Munro Government having
decided not to again renew his appointment, he left for Melbourne
in Dec. 1891. When the Munro Government was reconstructed under Mr.
Shiels, he was offered a portfolio, but declined to join the
Ministry except in the capacity of Premier. At the General Election
in April 1892 he was returned to the Assembly at the head of the
poll for the East Bourke Boroughs, and a few days later accepted
the post of Treasurer in the Shiels Ministry.</p>

Beveridge took up country on the lower Murray, settling at
Tyntyndyer, some ten miles below what is now Swan Hill. Here for
twenty-three years he made a careful study of the habits and
customs of the then numerous aborigines of the Lower Murray and
Riverine districts. The result of his observations was embodied in
a work entitled "The Aborigines of Victoria and Riverine,"
published posthumously in 1889. Mr. Beveridge, who latterly resided

<p><a name="A119" id="A119"></a><b>Bews, Hon. David</b>, M.P.,
sometime Minister of Education for South Australia, was born near
Kirkwall, in the Orkney Islands, in 1850, and went to South
Australia with his parents the following year. In 1853, during the
gold rush in Victoria, his family removed to that colony, but only
to return one year later. Mr. Bews' father then engaged in farming
operations near Port Elliot, and afterwards near Adelaide. Mr. Bews
continued as a farmer till he attained his majority, when he
secured a position as clerk with the Kadina &amp; Wallaroo Railway
Company. He subsequently became goods manager; but seven years
later (in 1879), when the Government took over the line, he left
the service, and entered the ranks of journalism by taking charge
of the <i>Wallaroo Times</i>. He was three times mayor of the
Wallaroo Corporation, besides which he was a member of the late
Yorke's Peninsula Local Road Board, and the School Board of Advice.
In 1885 Mr. Bews first entered the House of Assembly as member for
Wallaroo, and was re-elected on March 19th, 1887, and at the
General Election in 1890. In August of that year he accepted the
office of Minister of Education in Mr. Playford's Government. Mr.

where he arrived in December, and proceeded to the Castlemaine
goldfield. He returned to Melbourne in 1853, and practised his
profession. On April 18th, 1854, he was appointed Government
Assistant-Surveyor, and Geodetic Surveyor in 1860, and in this
capacity surveyed the boundary line between Victoria and New South
Wales. Mr. Black became District Surveyor in 1871, Assistant
Surveyor-General in 1878, and succeeded to his late position of
Surveyor-General of Victoria on the retirement of Mr. Skene in
1886. Mr. Black was a member of the Board of Land and Works, a

Montrose in the British House of Commons. He was born in London on
Dec. 15th, 1835, and married in 1861 a niece of the great
statesman, George Canning. Having emigrated to Victoria in 1852,
Mr. Black left the goldfields of that colony to try his luck in
pastoral pursuits in South Australia, subsequently going to
Riverina, and in 1864 to Queensland, where he still resides. He is
the inventor of a steam sheep-washing process, and went into sugar
planting in the Mackay district of Queensland in 1871. In 1881 he
was returned to the Legislative Assembly for that electorate, for
which he still sits. Having taken a prominent part in the agitation
for the separation of Northern Queensland from the rest of the
colony, and its formation into a distinct colony, he was in 1887
commissioned to go to England with Mr. Lissner to press the matter
upon the attention of the Home Government, Mr. Harold Finch-Hatton
and Dr. Ahearne having done much to bring the matter into the
region of practical politics by their exertions during the previous
year. Though not successful in inducing Lord Knutsford to take
steps for the separation of Northern Queensland, the advanced phase
which the question has since assumed is a good deal due to the
efforts of the delegation of 1887. In June 1888, on the formation
of the second McIlwraith Administration, Mr. Black became Secretary
of Public Works, and continued to hold the post when five months
later the Ministry was reconstructed under Mr. Morehead. He

Mr. Finlay, of Castle Toward, Argyleshire, Mr. Stuart Gladstone, of
Capenock, and Mr. Stewart, of Glenormiston, Perthshire, Scotland,
he purchased the Glenormiston property. The partnership, which was
highly remunerative after 1846, continued until 1868, when the
property was divided. Mr. Black bought Mr. Gladstone's portion, now
known as Mount Noorat, and resided on it until his death May 15th,

<p><a name="A135" id="A135"></a><b>Bland, Rivett Henry</b>, is the
son of Dr. Thomas Bland, and was born at Newark, Nottinghamshire,
on Feb. 2nd, 1811. He was educated at the Grammar School, Newark,
and studied for the medical profession at St. Bartholomew's
Hospital, London. Leaving England in May 1829, for Western
Australia, he arrived in August, and after a short interval was
appointed by the then Governor (Sir James Stirling) to settle the
York district, about seventy miles distant from Perth. In this
locality he remained for a number of years as resident magistrate,
his principal duty being to protect the settlers from the blacks,
with whose language and customs he obtained an intimate
acquaintance. Towards the end of 1848 he accompanied Captain
Charles Fitzgerald, who had in the meantime become Governor of
Western Australia, in the capacity of private secretary, on an
expedition to Champion Bay, for the purpose of examining a lode of
galena, discovered on the Murchison River by Mr. Augustus C.
Gregory. The party consisted of the Governor, Mr. Bland, Mr.
Gregory, three soldiers, and a servant. The discovery was verified,
but on the return journey the Governor was speared in the leg by
the blacks, and Mr. Bland had a narrow escape. Returning to England
after a visit to the eastern colonies, he was in 1852 appointed
resident Director of the Port Phillip and Colonial Gold Mining
Company, and arrived in Melbourne towards the end of that year. In
1856 he arranged with the proprietors of some land at Clunes to
commence mining operations on some quartz lodes, and erected an
extensive plant of machinery in conjunction with a party of miners,
afterwards called the Clunes Quartz Mining Company. This mine has
continued to be worked to the present time with varying results.
The total gold, raised from 1857 to 1884 was 506,220 ounces, of the
value of £2,029,078 13<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>., giving a profit of
nearly half a million from an outlay under £20,000.</p>

<p><a name="A136" id="A136"></a><b>Bland, William</b>, M.R.C.S.,
the son of Dr. Robert Bland, an eminent physician and writer on
medical subjects, was born in London on Nov. 5th, 1789, and
educated at Merchant Taylors' School. Having been admitted M.R.C.S.
in 1810, he received an appointment in the Royal Navy, and sailed
for Bombay. During the voyage he quarrelled with the purser, and
when they reached land a duel was fought, in which the purser was
killed. Lieutenant Randall, one of the ship's officers, having
insinuated unfairness, Mr. Bland fought him without result, but
they were afterwards arrested, tried at Calcutta, and sentenced to
seven years' transportation; Mr, Bland being sent to Sydney, where
he arrived in 1814, and having received a free pardon, practised
his profession. In the course of divorce proceedings which he had
instituted against his wife, Mr. Bland referred in libellous terms
to Governor Macquarie, and in consequence was criminally indicted
before the Supreme Court of New South Wales, and fined £50, with
twelve months in Parramatta Gaol, which sentence was fully exacted.
On his release Mr. Bland devoted himself to benevolent projects,
and took a prominent part as a member of the Patriotic Association,
in the great struggle for political emancipation which was then
engrossing the attention of the colonists, his efforts in the cause
of local autonomy entitling him to rank with Wentworth amongst the
greatest benefactors of the community, amongst whom he originally
came under such inauspicious circumstances. When the elections to
the first partially representative Legislative Council of New South
Wales took place in 1843, Mr. Bland was returned, along with
Wentworth, for the city of Sydney. Five years later, however, the
tide of popular feeling turned against him in favour of more
extremist agitators, headed by Mr. Robert Lowe (now Lord
Sherbrooke); and when, in 1848, the elections took place for the
new Legislative Council, in which Sydney had three members given
her instead of two, Mr. Bland was lowest on the poll of the four
candidates, Messrs. Wentworth, Lowe, and Lamb being elected,
despite the incisive attack made by Wentworth on Mr. Lowe's
inconsistencies, and his impassioned appeal to the constituency to
reject himself rather than his friend Mr. Bland, of whom he said,
"No man has ever served a country in a purer spirit of patriotism,
no man ever more deeply deserved the gratitude of a generous
people, than he has." Mr. Bland died suddenly in Sydney, on July
21st, 1868. He was the author of "Suppression of Spontaneous
Combustion in Woolships" (second edition, 1845), "Letters to
Charles Buller, M.P." (1849), and other brochures.</p>

<p><a name="A137" id="A137"></a><b>Blyth, Hon. Sir Arthur</b>,
K.C.M.G., C.B., late Agent-General for South Australia, was the son
of William Blyth, late of Adelaide, S.A., but previously of
Birmingham, England, by Sarah, daughter of Rev. William Wilkins, of
Bourton-on-the-Water, in Gloucestershire. He was born at Birmingham
on March 19th, 1823, and educated at King Edward VI. Grammar
School, in that town. Having emigrated to South Australia with his
father and brothers in 1839, only three years after the formal
constitution of the colony, he engaged in commercial pursuits, from
which he retired in 1861. An instalment of representative
government having been conceded, Sir Arthur, in 1855, entered the
semi-elective Council as elected member for Yatala. Prior to this
he had occupied various local posts, having been Chairman of the
Mitcham District Council, Assessor of the City Corporation, Captain
of the first Volunteer Force, formed during the Russian War scare;
and a member of the Central Road Board, and of the Chamber of
Commerce. The Council had been dissolved by Sir Richard MacDonnell,
the then Governor, with a view to the adoption of a new
constitution on more liberal lines than the one previously in
force. This great work was promptly achieved, and Sir Arthur Blyth
took a prominent part in the legislation which enlarged the
suffrage, instituted the bicameral system, and settled the
constitution upon what, with slight changes, is its present basis.
In the Legislative Assembly constituted under the Bill, Sir Arthur
took his seat as member for Gumeracha, and represented the
constituency till 1868. The Finniss Ministry, which included the
author of the Torrens Act, having resigned office, the Baker
Ministry was formed, in which Sir Arthur Blyth held the post of
Commissioner of Public Works throughout its short-lived existence,
from August to Sept. 1857. From June 1858 to May 1860 Sir Arthur
held a similar position in the Hanson Ministry. In October of the
following year Sir Arthur accepted the post of Treasurer under Mr.
Waterhouse's premiership, but resigned with his colleagues in July
1863. In August 1864 Sir Arthur formed his first Administration,
holding, along with the premiership, the rather unusual post of
Commissioner of Crown Lands and Emigration. In March 1865 he was
thrown out of power, but came back as Treasurer under his old
colleague, Sir Henry Ayers, in Sept. 1865. This Ministry was also
only formed to die; but Sir Arthur was not long in opposition,
becoming Chief Secretary under Mr. Boucaut in March 1866. The May
of 1867 saw him again out of office, and he remained in opposition
until May 1870, when he joined Mr. Hart as, for the second time,
Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration. In Nov. 1871 the
Government was reconstructed, and Sir Arthur became Treasurer and
Premier. He did not secure a firm tenure, being thrown out in the
January following. He, however, became Premier for the third time
in July 1873, and was successful in holding his own till June 1875,
when Mr. Boucaut's extensive scheme of public undertakings caused
the electors to look askance at the more cautious policy of Sir
Arthur Blyth's Cabinet. In March 1876 he accepted office as
Treasurer in the reconstructed Boucaut Ministry, and in Feb. 1877
was appointed Agent-General in succession to the late Mr. F. S.
Dutton. Prior to this Sir Arthur had revisited England, remaining
from 1868 to 1870, in which latter year he was re-elected for
Gumeracha, and sat until 1875, when he transferred his services to
North Adelaide. In 1850 Sir Arthur married Jessie Anne, daughter of
Edward Forrest, of Birmingham. In 1877, soon after his arrival in
London, he was created a Knight Commander of St. Michael and St.
George, and in 1886 received the Civil Companionship of the Order
of the Bath, in recognition of services rendered in connection with
the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, at which he represented his
colony both as Royal and Executive Commissioner. He was also
presented with the freedom of the Salters' Company, one of the most
ancient and exclusive of the City Guilds. In 1887 Sir Arthur was
associated with Sir John Downer as one of the representatives of
South Australia, at the Colonial Conference held in London in that
year. He died at Bournemouth on Dec. 7th, 1891. Lady Blyth died a
fortnight later.</p>

engaged in commercial pursuits. He was member for East Torrens from
March 13th, 1860, to July 9th, 1867, when he resigned. He was
returned for Encounter Bay on April 16th, 1868, but retired at the
dissolution on March 2nd, 1870. He was elected for Victoria on Aug.
24th, 1871, and at the dissolution in Nov. 1871 unsuccessfully
contested Encounter Bay. He visited England and the continent of
Europe from 1873 to 1875. On his brother, Hon. (now Sir) Arthur
Blyth, accepting the office of Agent-General, he was returned in
his stead for North Adelaide, on March 14th, 1877. Mr. Blyth was
re-elected on March 29th, 1878, but resigned and finally retired
from Parliament on Dec. 2nd in the same year. He was Treasurer in
Mr. Hart's Ministry from Sept. 24th to Oct. 13th, 1868, and
Minister of Education in Mr. Boucaut's Cabinet from Oct. 26th,
1877, to Sept. 27th, 1878. Mr. Blyth married at Alderley Edge,
Cheshire, in 1852, Miss Julia Barnes, who still survives. Mr. Blyth
took up his residence in England in 1878, and was a member of the
London Commission for the Adelaide Jubilee Exhibition of 1887. He
died at Sutton, Surrey, on Feb. 15th, 1890.</p>

of the Seymour Shire Council, and having unsuccessfully contested
Moira in the Liberal interest in 1877, was returned to the
Legislative Assembly for that constituency in 1880. He was
Postmaster-General in the O'Loghlen Government from July 1881 to

of cattle overland from New South Wales to Victoria for Mr. Ebden,
and in April of the following year the first mob of cattle from
N.S.W. to South Australia, in which colony he subsequently settled.
From 1842 to 1857 he was Commissioner for Crown Lands, S.A. From
Oct. 1856 to August 1857, was a member of the first Ministry formed
under responsible government. Mr. Bonney was member for East
Torrens in the Legislative Assembly from 1857 to 1858, and was a

following year he emigrated to Australia, arriving at Hobart on
Oct. 10th. He spent eight years in Tasmania, three in South
Australia, twenty in Victoria, and travelled extensively throughout
New South Wales and Queensland. He acted as Inspector of Schools
for the Ballarat district of Victoria for four years, when a severe
sunstroke, which caused partial paralysis, incapacitated him from
all work for nearly four years. He opened a school at St. Kilda,
near Melbourne, in 1863, and returned to England for the benefit of
his health in 1870, but has since several times revisited
Melbourne. He has been engaged for the last four years as Archivist
to the New South Wales Government, in the preparation of materials
for the official history of that colony. Mr. Bonwick has been a
most industrious author and compiler. Amongst his numerous works

<p><a name="A142" id="A142"></a><b>Bonython, John Langdon</b>, J.
P., was born in London, Oct. 15th, 1848. He is a son of George L.
Bonython, and is descended from an old family&mdash;the Bonythons
of Bonython, and Carclew, in Cornwall. At an early age he went with
his parents to South Australia, and was educated in Adelaide. He
joined the literary staff of <i>The Advertiser</i>, which is the
popular journal of South Australia. Having served as reporter and
sub-editor, he became some years ago the editor, which position he
now fills. In 1879 he entered the proprietary of <i>The
Advertiser</i> and associated journals (<i>The Express</i>, an
evening paper, and <i>The Chronicle</i>, a weekly paper); and
eventually the firm, which had been Barrow &amp; King, became
Burden (Mr. F. B. Burden, J.P.) &amp; Bonython. When the Adelaide
School Board was appointed, Mr. Bonython was nominated a member. In
1883 he was elected chairman, and at the present time holds that
office. He was a member of a board appointed by the Government in
1886 to consider the question of technical education. As
recommended by this Board a School of Mines and Industries was
established, and Mr. Bonython was made a member of the Council,
which included some of the best known and most representative men
in the colony. The first chairman, Dr. Cockburn, having soon after
his appointment to resign through becoming Premier, Mr. Bonython
was unanimously elected to the position, which he now occupies. He
was one of the local commission for the Melbourne Centennial
Exhibition of 1888. He is a justice of the peace, a member of the
council of the South Australian branch of the Geographical Society
of Australasia, and vice-president of the South Australian Cornish
Association. Mr. Bonython is recognised as a shrewd politician, who
has probably had as much influence on the legislation of the
country as men actively engaged in politics. To his untiring energy
the success of the journals with which he is connected is largely
due.</p>

<p><a name="A143" id="A143"></a><b>Boothby, His Honour
Benjamin</b>, sometime Judge of the Supreme Court of South
Australia, son of the late Benjamin Boothby, was born at Doncaster
in Yorkshire on Feb. 5th, 1803. He was called to the bar at Gray's
Inn in 1825, and became Revising Barrister for the West Riding of
Yorkshire, and Recorder of Pontefract. In Feb. 1853 he was
appointed Second Judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia, and
was sworn in on Oct. 17th, 1853. Soon after his arrival he
manifested a dislike to colonial enactments, which he did not
attempt to conceal. The words " "<i>ultra vires</i>" and
"repugnant" constantly figured in his judicial pronouncements, and
he protested from the bench against the validity of the
appointments of his colleagues, Chief Justice Hanson and Mr.
Justice Gwynne. Twice the Parliament passed addresses for Mr.
Justice Boothby'a removal from the bench, but in vain. He had warm
defenders in Parliament, and one ministry resigned on account of
differences of opinion in the Cabinet with regard to the action to
be taken. Some of his decisions against the validity of the South
Australian statutes were confirmed on appeal to the Privy Council,
and this greatly encouraged him in his warfare against things
colonial. Several validating Acts were passed by the Imperial
Parliament to give force to the South Australian laws or remove
doubts concerning them. Still the judge was not more practicable.
Suitors suffered seriously from delays and obstructions in the
Supreme Court, and at last business in that tribunal was brought
into such a condition that it was necessary for the Executive to
take decided action. Several years before Mr. Justice Boothby
arrived in the colony grand juries had been abolished, Parliament
regarding them as useless. Soon, if not immediately, after his
arrival the judge expressed his strong disapproval of this
innovation; but still he tried prisoners without grand juries for
about thirteen years, and then, at a particularly heavy criminal
sittings, declared that the accused persons on the calendar could
not legally be tried without a grand jury. They were all kept in
gaol or had their bail renewed, as the case might be, till the next
criminal sittings, when another judge tried them. This was the
occasion of the second unsuccessful Parliamentary Address to the
Queen for Mr. Justice Boothby's removal. He was not allowed to
preside at a criminal sitting again; when his turn came round he
was prevented, by a special commission to the Chief Justice
directing him to try prisoners. In 1867 the patience of the
Judicial Bench, the bar, and the colonists was exhausted. Charges
were made against Mr. Justice Boothby of obstructing the
administration of justice, and of unseemly conduct on the bench, as
exhibited in his demeanour towards his colleagues and towards
counsel. These charges were dealt with by the Executive Council
under the authority of an Act of George III., the Governor
presiding, and the judge was "amoved." The Crown Solicitor, Mr.
Wearing, who was afterwards drowned in the wreck of the
<i>Gothenburg</i>, in Torres Straits, was appointed to succeed him.
Out of all this trouble, observes Mr. J. P. Stow (whose account has
been quoted) some benefit accrued to the colony: the amoved judge
accurately ruled that, owing to some omission in bringing the new
constitution into force, the Legislative itself was invalid, and
the defect was remedied by the Imperial Parliament. The repugnancy
nuisance was effectually disposed of. Nothing can now be ruled
repugnant unless it is so to an Imperial Act specifically applying
to the colonies. The last Imperial Validating Statute was of a most
comprehensive character. With the above exception no Colonial Act
can be ruled invalid after receiving the Queen's assent, or after
proclamation that she has not exercised her power of disallowance.
The greatest inconvenience and alarm was caused in the year 1865 by
the decision of the majority of the judges&mdash;namely, Justices
Boothby and Gwynne&mdash;that the South Australian Legislature had
no power to establish Courts of Judicature. This invalidated all
the local courts of the colony, they having jurisdiction in civil
cases up to £100, and the Insolvency Court. The Imperial Validating
Act, however, settled this difficulty, greatly to the relief of
suitors in particular, and the public generally. The powers of the
Local Court of Appeal were enlarged by an Act of the South
Australian Parliament, passed in 1861. This anomalous tribunal,
consisting of the Executive, of whom nearly all are laymen, owes
its continued existence to the recollection the colonists have of
the "repugnancy" and "<i>ultra vires</i>" troubles. Judge Boothby
died on June 21st, 1868, whilst on the point of leaving for England
to initiate an appeal to the Privy Council.</p>

established the business of Messrs. Faulding &amp; Co. He proceeded
to Melbourne in 1851, and began business at Richmond. Having
discovered the remarkable antiseptic properties of the eucalyptus,
he went largely into the manufacture of its products. The
Pharmaceutical Society of Victoria was founded mainly through his
instrumentality in 1857. He was twice mayor of Richmond, and
chairman of the local bench for five years consecutively. From 1874
to 1889 he was M.L.A. for the city, but was defeated in the latter
year. Having represented Victoria at the Calcutta Exhibition in
1883, he was appointed President of the Royal Commission of that
colony at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, held at South
Kensington in 1886, for his services at which he was created C.M.G.
on June 28th of that year. Mr. Bosisto is a J.P. for Victoria, and

H.E.I.C.S., by Winifred, daughter of the late James Penn,
Superintendent of H.M.'s Dockyard, Mylor, Falmouth, was born near
that place on Oct. 29th, 1831. He came to South Australia with his
father (who died in 1872) in 1846, and was called to the bar in
1855. He was returned to the Legislative Assembly for the city of
Adelaide on Dec. 9th, 1861, on the resignation of Sir R. D. Hanson;
but was defeated at the general election in Nov. 1862. He was
returned for West Adelaide at the general election in March 1865,
and sat till the dissolution in March 1868, when he was returned
for the Burra. He was, however, defeated at the general election in
March 1870; but in August 1871 re-entered the Assembly as member
for the West Torrens district, in succession to Mr. Strangways, who
resigned. He was again returned for West Torrens at the general
election in Dec. 1871, and sat till the dissolution in 1875, when
he became member for Encounter Bay; and having been re-elected in
April 1878, he finally retired on Sept. 25th in the same year, on
being appointed a judge. Mr. Boucaut first took office in Mr.
Hart's Ministry, on Oct. 23rd, 1865, being appointed
Attorney-General, a position which he had refused when offered him
by Mr. (afterwards Sir) Henry Ayers, immediately after his return
for West Adelaide in March. On March 28th, 1866, the Ministry was
reconstructed under the premiership of Mr. Boucaut, who continued
to hold office as Attorney-General until May 3rd, 1867, when he
retired with his colleagues, in connection with the Moonta
question. At this time he refused a Q.C.-ship, and subsequently
frequently declined office. In 1872, however, he joined Mr.
Hughes', or, as it is generally called, Mr. Ayers' Ministry, "to
establish the principle that the Governor was not entitled
absolutely to say that the framer of the Government should
necessarily be its head." Having established this principle, the
ministry resigned, and Mr. Boucaut was out of office till June 3rd,
1875, when he again became Premier, and initiated the famous
"Boucaut policy," which embraced a wide scheme of public works. In
this, his second administration, Mr. Boucaut held the post of
Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration, and subsequently the
commissionership of Public Works. On March 25th, 1876, Mr. Boucaut
reconstituted his ministry, Mr. Way having become Chief Justice,
and Mr. (afterwards Sir) Wm. Morgan and Mr. Colton having retired.
He was turned out of office on June 6th, 1876, partly, as his
friends asserted, by backstairs cabals, and partly because he
refused to borrow large sums of money without making provision to
pay the interest, his taxation proposals having been rejected in
two sessions by the Legislative Council. Mr. Boucaut again became
Premier on Oct. 25th, 1877, and held that office till he was raised
to the judicial bench in Oct. 1878. "As a politician," a friendly
hand writes, "his horror of a plutocracy made him democratic; but
his love of fair play often tinged that with conservatism, as he
generally opposed extreme views, and did not sacrifice a far-seeing
purpose for the sake of a present advantage, nor would he court
popularity by the sacrifice of independence. He was amongst the
most national of Australian politicians, and strongly dwelt upon
the community of interest between South Australia and New South
Wales. He advocated a gradual extension of railways from Adelaide
to Wentworth, in order to join the Sydney lines to the Barrier
Ranges, to Innamincka, and northwards across the Continent,
although strongly opposing any immediate attempt to extend it to
Port Darwin." Judge Boucaut was Acting Chief Justice during the
absence in England on leave of Chief Justice Way, 1891-92. He has
been several times Deputy Governor and twice administrator of the

<p><a name="A148" id="A148"></a><b>Bourke, General Sir Richard</b>,
K.C.B., sometime Governor of New South Wales, eldest son of John
Bourke, of Thornfield, co. Limerick, Ireland, by his marriage with
Anne, daughter of Edmund Ryan, of Boscobel, co. Tipperary, was born
on May 4th, 1778, and educated at Westminster School and Oxford
University, where he matriculated at Oriel College in 1793, and
graduated B.A. at Exeter in 1798. Sir Richard, who succeeded to his
father's property in 1795, entered the army in 1798, and served
with great distinction in Holland in the next year's campaign,
being severely wounded in the face. After being, for a short time,
Superintendent of the Military College at Marlow, he was appointed
Quartermaster-General in South America in 1806, and in the
following year was present at the storming of Monte Video. He
served in the Peninsular year from 1809 to 1814, was raised to the
rank of major-general in 1821, and acted as Lieut.-Governor of the
Cape of Good Hope from 1826 to 1828. Sir Richard assumed office as
Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of New South Wales and its
dependencies in Dec. 1831, and held the reins until Dec. 1837, when
he left the colony amidst the regrets of the people. Sir Richard,
who was created K.C.B. in 1835, and was made colonel of the 64th
regiment on his leaving New South Wales in 1837, became
lieut.-general in Jan. 1851, and general in November of the same
year. He was one of the witnesses to the will of the Right Hon.
Edmund Burke, with whom he claimed kinship; and he edited, in
conjunction with Charles, 5th Earl Fitzwilliam, an edition of that
great statesman's correspondence. Sir Richard, who was High Sheriff
of co. Limerick in 1839, married, on March 1st, 1800, Elizabeth
Jane, youngest daughter of John Bourke, of Carshalton, Surrey,
Receiver-General of the Land Tax for Middlesex, by his wife, Mary
Battye of Yorkshire. This lady died at Parramatta, N.S.W. on May
7th, 1832, and was interred there. Sir Richard died on August 12th,
1855, at his seat at Thornfield, where his only surviving son
Richard resided. A monument was erected to Sir Richard Bourke's
memory in the Domain, Sydney, the inscription on which well
summarises his services as Governor of New South Wales, at a time
when the Queen's representatives in Australia were allowed a much
greater initiative than is the case at present. It runs as follows:
"This statue of Lieutenant-General Sir Richard Bourke, K.C.B., is
erected by the people of New South Wales, to record his able,
honest, and benevolent administration from 1831 to 1837. Selected
for the government at a period of singular difficulty, his
judgment, urbanity, and firmness justified the choice.
Comprehending at once the vast resources peculiar to this colony,
he applied them, for the first time, systematically to its benefit.
He voluntarily divested himself of the prodigious influence arising
from the assignment of penal labour, and enacted just and salutary
laws for the amelioration of penal discipline. He was the first
Governor who published satisfactory accounts of public receipts and
expenditure. Without oppression or detriment to any interest he
raised the revenue to a vast amount, and from its surplus realised
extensive plans of immigration. He established religions equality
on a just and firm basis, and sought to provide for all, without
distinction of sect, a sound and adequate system of national
education. He constructed various public works of permanent
utility. He founded the flourishing settlement of Port Phillip, and
threw open the wilds of Australia to pastoral enterprise. He
established savings banks, and was the patron of the first
Mechanics' Institute. He created an equitable tribunal for
determining upon claims to grants of lands. He was the warm friend
of the liberty of the Press. He extended trial by jury after its
almost total suspension for many years. By these, and numerous
other measures for the moral, religious and general improvement of
all classes he raised the colony to unexampled prosperity, and
retired amid the reverent and affectionate regret of the people,
having won their confidence by his integrity, their gratitude by
his services, their admiration by his public talents, and their
esteem by his private worth." Sir Richard, though in the first
instance he discountenanced the formation of a settlement at Port
Phillip, ultimately induced the Home Government to recognise it. In
1837 he visited the incipient colony, and was the author of most of
its existing nomenclature, giving the present names to Hobson's
Bay, and the city of Melbourne itself, and his own family
designation to the metropoltian county, and to one of the principal
streets of the embryo capital of what was to become the great
colony of Victoria.</p>

<p><a name="A150" id="A150"></a><b>Bowen, Hon. Charles
Christopher</b>, M.L.C., was born at Milford, co. Mayo, Ireland, in
1830, being the eldest son of Charles Bowen, one of the founders of
Canterbury, who was Speaker of the Provincial Council from 1855 to
1864. He was educated at Rugby and Cambridge, but left the
University without taking a degree, and went out to the Canterbury
Settlement in one of the first four ships, acting, until Dec. 1852,
as secretary to Mr. Godley. In the Provincial Council of Canterbury
Mr. Bowen was for some years Treasurer. In 1859 he visited England,
where he remained till 1862; and upon his return was, in 1864,
appointed Resident Magistrate at Christchurch, which office he held
till 1874. From 1872 to 1874 he was Chairman of the Canterbury
Board of Education. Mr. Bowen, on Dec. 16th, 1874, was called to
the Legislative Council to take office under Sir Julius Vogel, but
immediately afterwards resigned his seat and entered the Lower
House as member for Kaiapoi. His offices were those of Minister of
Justice and Commissioner of Stamps, which he held until the advent
of the Grey Ministry into power on Oct 14th, 1877. During his
tenure of office, he busied himself with the reform of prison
management, introducing the system of "marks" into gaols. He also
carried through the House in 1877 the Education Act, which
established free primary schools and compulsory attendance
throughout the colony. Mr. Bowen retired from Parliament in 1881,
when he paid another visit to England. Mr. Bowen was called to the
Upper House in 1891.</p>

<p><a name="A151" id="A151"></a><b>Bowen, Right Hon. Sir George
Ferguson</b>, G.C.M.G., D.C.L., LL.D., successively Governor of
Queensland, N.Z., and Victoria, is the eldest son of the late Rev.
Edward Bowen, rector of Taughboyne, county Donegal, and was born in
1821. He was educated at the Charterhouse and at Trinity College,
Oxford, where he obtained a scholarship in 1840, and graduated B.A.
as first class in classics in 1844. In the same year he was elected
to a fellowship at Brasenose College, and became a member of
Lincoln's Inn, In 1847 he was appointed President of the University
of Corfu, and in 1854 became Chief Secretary of the Government of
the Ionian Islands, in which post he remained till 1859, when he
was appointed the first Governor of the new colony of Queensland.
Taking with him Mr. (now Sir Robert) Herbert as Colonial Secretary,
he successfully organised the government of the infant colony, and
presided over the inauguration of responsible institutions, Mr.
Herbert becoming the first Premier. His term of Office expiring in
Jan. 1868, he became Governor of New Zealand, where he had the
difficult task of bringing the Maori War to an end. His rule gave
entire satisfaction to the Colonial Office, and when in March 1873
he was transferred to Victoria, the official intimation of his
promotion was couched in very complimentary terms. From Jan. 1875
to Jan. 1876 he was at home on his first leave of absence. On his
return to Melbourne his troubles began. Sir William Stawell, who
had held the reins in the interim, had shown somewhat too little
flexibility in the exercise of his temporary powers, with the
result that a constitutional struggle of unparalleled bitterness
had been commenced between the supporters of Sir James McCulloch on
the one hand and those of the Liberal party, under Mr. (now Sir
Graham) Berry, on the other. At the general election in May 1877
the latter swept the country, and Mr. Berry formed an
administration, which in the course of a lengthened struggle with
the Upper House on the question of payment of members, and
ultimately of the reform of the latter body itself, resorted to
measures which were denounced by its opponents as unconstitutional
and cruel, the latter term being applied to what were known as the
"Black Wednesday" dismissals of civil servants in Dec. 1878.
Throughout the whole of the struggle Sir George Bowen acted on the
constitutional principle of accepting the advice of his Ministers
when not illegal. He was thus exposed to some personal
animadversion from the Council and its organs in the press. On the
whole, however, the Colonial Office justified his attitude, which
was also approved by Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Childers, the late Earl of
Carnarvon, and the late Mr. W. E. Forster. Sir George Bowen quitted
the government of Victoria in Feb. 1879, on the expiry of the usual
term of office, and was Governor of Mauritius till 1883 and of Hong
Kong from that year till 1887, when he retired on a pension, having
declined the offer made to him of continuing at Hong Kong. In 1886
he was appointed to the Privy Council, having been created C.M.G.
in 1855; K.C.M.G. in 1856; and G.C.M.G. in 1860. In 1888 Sir George
Bowen was appointed Royal Commissioner at Malta to make
arrangements respecting the new constitution granted to that
island. He is the author of "A Handbook for Travellers in Greece,"
in Murray's Series; "Mount Athos, Thessaly, and Epirus: a Diary of
a Journey from Constantinople to Corfu" (1852); "Ithaca in 1850";
and "Imperial Federation" (1886). A full account of his public
services will be found in "Thirty Years of Colonial Government,"
which comprises a selection from his despatches and letters whilst
in the service of the Colonial Office, and was edited by Mr.
Stanley Lane Poole. Sir George Bowen, besides being an honorary
D.C.L. of Oxford and an honorary LL.D. of Cambridge, is a member of
the governing bodies of the Imperial Institute and of Charterhouse
School. He married in 1856 the Countess Roma, only surviving
daughter of Count Roma, G.C.M.G., then President of the Senate of
the Ionian Islands.</p>

Upper Mill, near Saddleworth, Yorkshire, on April 11th, 1819. In
1841 he emigrated to Port Phillip (now Victoria), and after a
varied experience in New Zealand and New South Wales, finally
settled in South Australia in 1847, where he established a
successful business as a timber merchant at Port Adelaide. In 1865
he was returned to the Assembly as member for the combined
electorate of Wallaroo and Port Adelaide, and in 1875 was elected
for Port Adelaide, which he represented for a number of years. Mr.
Bower was Commissioner of Public Works in the Bray Ministry from
April to June 1884.</p>

clergymen of the Wesleyan Methodist Church of New South Wales, was
a native of the United Kingdom. In his early career his time was
chiefly given to missionary work, and about 1830 he proceeded to
South Africa, where he laboured for thirteen years as a missionary.
In Jan. 1846 he arrived in Sydney, with the appointment of General
Superintendent of Wesleyan Missions. Subsequently he was
unanimously elected President of the first Wesleyan Conference held
in Australia. In 1850 he was appointed a member of the Senate of
the Sydney University, being one of the sixteen original members of
that body. He died in Sydney, at the age of eighty-four, on March
8th, 1889. Mr. Boyce was the author of several works of a
theological character. [This biography appeared in the

<p><a name="A154" id="A154"></a><b>Bracken, Thomas</b>, was born
Dec. 21st, 1843, in Ireland, and arrived in Victoria at the age of
twelve. After experiencing the ups and downs of colonial life for
several years, Mr. Bracken went to Otago, N.Z., in 1869, and
connected himself shortly afterwards with journalism in that
province. He was connected with the <i>Otago Guardian</i> in the
first year or two of its existence, and subsequent founded a weekly
paper, called <i>The Saturday Advertiser</i>, which he conducted
with marked ability. In 1881 he was elected to represent Dunedin
Central in the House of Representatives, but lost his seat at the
elections of 1884. Mr. Bracken is best known as the author of
several collections of verses, and the following books are from his
pen: "Flowers of the Freelands," "Paddy Murphy's Budget," "Pulpit
Lectures," "Beyond the Tomb, and other Poems," "The New Zealand
Tourist," "The Land of the Maori and the Moa," and "Musings in
Maori Land" (Keirle, Dunedin, 1890).</p>

<p><a name="A155" id="A155"></a><b>Braddon, Sir Edward Nicholas
Coventry</b>, K.C.M.G., born June 11th, 1829, is the son of Henry
Braddon, of Skisdon, and member of the junior branch of the
Braddons of Treglith and Treworgye, who <i>temp</i>. Elizabeth sent
representatives of Liskeard to the British House of Commons. He
went to India in 1847 to join his cousin's mercantile house in
Calcutta. After varied experience, he accepted an appointment in
the Government service as Assistant Commissioner in Santhalia;
served in the Santhal rebellion with favourable mention; after the
suppression of the Santhal outbreak, raised a regiment of Santhals,
for which he was specially thanked by the Lieut.-Governor of
Bengal; and then served with Sir George Yule's Volunteer force in
the Indian mutiny (medal and favourable mention). In 1862 he was
appointed Commissioner of Excise and Stamps, and, subsequently,
Inspector-General of Registration and Superintendent of Trade
Statistics in that province. During eighteen months he acted also
as Secretary to the Chief Commissioner in the Revenue Departments.
In 1870 he was specially deputed to inquire into and report upon
the operation of the salt tax in Oudh and the north-west provinces,
and, as one result of his labours, obtained a considerable
relaxation of the law in respect of the illicit manufacture of
salt, which had been exceedingly harsh and oppressive. In 1878 he
retired on pension, and went to Tasmania. In July 1879 he was
elected to the House of Assembly as member for West Devon, and held
that seat continuously (being twice elected against opposition and
twice unopposed) until Oct. 29th, 1888, when he was appointed
Agent-General for the Colony in London. Mr. Braddon is a staunch
Free Trader, and was a prominent Oppositionist until he carried his
party into power. When in March 1887 he was called upon to form an
Administration, Mr. Braddon resigned the Premiership to the Hon. P.
O. Fysh, a colonist of longer standing, and took the leadership of
the Assembly as Minister of Lands and Works, holding also the
portfolio of Minister of Education. He was sworn of the Executive
Council, on March 29th, 1887, and was one of the representatives of
Tasmania at the second session of the Federal Council of Australia,
held at Hobart in Jan. 1888. As Agent-General Mr. Braddon was
instrumental in the successful notation of the first
Three-and-a-half per Cent. Tasmanian Loan. He has also devoted much
attention to the promotion of Tasmanian industries, notably the
fruit and timber trades and mining. He read a paper on "Tasmania,
its Resources and Products," before the Royal Colonial Institute,
session 1888-9. Mr. Braddon, who is a brother of Miss Braddon, the
well-known authoress, was created K.C.M.G. on Jan. 1st, 1891.</p>

Nov. 14th, 1832, and educated at Winchester, and at Balliol
College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1854, becoming Fellow
of All Souls' in the same university in the following year, and
D.C.L. in 1863. He entered at the Middle Temple in Nov. 1854, and
was called to the bar in June 1857. He went to Queensland in 1859
as private secretary to Sir George Bowen, the first governor, and
held that post for two years, when he resigned. From 1863 to 1866
he sat in the Legislative Council, and was a member without
portfolio of the first Ministry formed by his friend Mr. (now Sir)
Robert Herbert from July 1863 to Feb. 1866, acting temporarily as
Attorney-General from August to Sept. 1865. Subsequently he
returned to England, and remained for two years, acting in 1867 as
Assistant Boundary Commissioner for Devon and Cornwall under the
Reform Act of that year. Returning to Queensland in 1868, he
represented Burnett in the Legislative Assembly from April 1871 to
Dec. 1873, and was Attorney-General in the Palmer Ministry from May
1870 to Jan. 1874, when he resigned to accept the same office in
Hong Kong, where he also acted as judge. In June 1876 Mr. Bramston
was appointed to his present post as Assistant Under Secretary of
State in the Colonial Office, being employed on a mission to Berlin
in connection with the Angra Pequena negotiations in July 1886, in
which year he was created C.B. Mr. Bramston married, on Dec. 12th,
1872, Eliza Isabella, daughter of the late Rev. Harry Vane Russell.
He was appointed Registrar of the Order of St. Michael and St.
George in 1892.</p>

<p><a name="A157" id="A157"></a><b>Bray, Hon. Sir John Cox</b>,
M.L.A., Agent-General for South Australia, is the son of the late
T. C. Bray, and was born in East Adelaide in 1842. He commenced his
education at St. Peter's College in that city, but completed it in
England. On his return to Australia, he commenced to qualify for
practice as a solicitor, and on the expiry of his articles first
entered Parliament in 1871 as the representative of East Adelaide,
by which district he has been returned to the House of Assembly
ever since. It was not until 1875 that he filled any ministerial
position. When Mr. Justice Bundey, who had been Minister of Justice
and Education in the Blyth Ministry, resigned, Mr. Bray was
appointed in his place on March 15th, 1875, but the Government only
lasted till June 3rd of the same year. In June 1876 Mr. Colton
formed his first Administration, and appointed Mr. Bray to the post
of Attorney-General, which he held till the Ministry retired, on
Oct. 26th, 1877. For the next four years Mr. Bray was the generally
recognised leader of the Opposition, although when Sir William
Morgan's Ministry resigned in 1881, the Governor sent for Mr.
Colton. This gentleman, however, declined the task of forming a
ministry, and Mr. Bray was sent for, and got together a ministry
which was strong enough to remain in office for three years. In
1884 Mr. Bray made a trip to England, and returned to the colony by
way of America. On arriving in Adelaide, he found the Downer
Government in power, and on the resignation of Mr. Darling, who
held office as Commissioner of Public Works, he joined Mr. Downer
as Chief Secretary on Oct. 14th, 1885, resigning that position for
the post of Treasurer on June 8th, 1886. He went out of office on
the downfall of the Downer Ministry, on June 7th, 1887; but in May
1888, on the death of the late Sir Robert Ross, he was elected to
fill the position of Speaker of the House of Assembly&mdash;a post
which he held with marked ability during the remainder of the
Parliament. He declined, however, to again accept the position at
the opening of the Parliament in 1890, preferring to re-enter the
active arena of politics. Mr. Bray was created K.C.M.G. in 1890,
his acceptance of the distinction provoking considerable comment,
it having been understood that he had on a previous occasion
declined it, on grounds similar to those which influenced Mr.
Higinbotham, Mr. Francis, and Mr. Deakin, in refusing the title.
Sir John Bray, however, defended his action on the ground that,
having accepted an office under the Crown which, according to
well-known custom, carried with it the honour of knighthood, he
would have been casting a slur upon his predecessors and doing an
injustice to his successors in repudiating it. Sir John Bray, who
accepted the post of Chief Secretary in the Playford Government in
August 1890, has taken an active part in the proceedings of the
South Australian Natives Association, and presided over the
Intercolonial Conference of these bodies, which in 1890 declared in
favour of Australasian Federation. He was elected by the South
Australian Legislative Assembly to be one of the representatives of
the colony to the Federation Convention, held in Sydney in 1891.
Sir John Bray was, it may be added, one of the representatives of
his colony at the Intercolonial Conference held In Sydney in Nov.
1883, out of which the Federal Council of Australasia sprang. He
was a member of the South Australian Commission for the Colonial
and Indian Exhibition of 1886, and Vice-President of the South
Australian Commission to the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition of
1888. In Jan. 1892 Sir John Bray left Adelaide to assume the post
of Agent-General in succession to the late Sir Arthur Blyth, and
took over charge of the London office on Feb. 29th of that
year.</p>

<p><a name="A157a" id="A157a"></a><b>Brennan, Louis</b>, C.B., the
inventor of the torpedo which bears his name, is the son of Thomas
Brennan by his marriage with Miss Bridget MacDonel, and was born in
Ireland on Jan. 28th, 1852. He went to Melbourne with his parents
when eleven years of age. A few years later he was articled to
Mr. Alexander Kennedy Smith, the well-known civil and mechanical
engineer, and quickly displayed great aptitude in his profession.
Mr. Brennan may be said to have first conceived the idea of his now
celebrated torpedo in May 1874, but the initiatory stages of
perfecting the invention, proving it by trials, and bringing it
into notice in the right quarters occupied several years, Mr.
Brennan being ultimately aided by a grant of £700 from the
Victorian Government. With a view to securing its adoption by the
imperial authorities, Mr. Brennan formed a small company to exploit
the invention, and himself went to England towards the end of 1880.
The torpedo, through the kindly interposition of Sir Andrew
Clarke, was favourably considered by the War Office, but it was not
finally adopted by the British Government till 1887, when, after
years of anxious thought and laborious experiment, Mr. Brennan
brought the apparatus to its present perfection, and it was
purchased by the Imperial Government for £110,000, Mr. Brennan
being employed by the Government to superintend the manufacture and
to aid in its practical utilisation for a period of five years. On
the expiry of this engagement it was again renewed, in March 1892;
and on May 25th following Mr. Brennan was gazetted to the
distinction of C.B. He married in Dublin on Sept. 10th, 1891, his
cousin, Miss Anna Quinn. An excellent description of the torpedo
will be found in the recent issue of the "Encyclopædia Britannica."

Wesleyan ministry in that colony. An affection of the throat,
however, necessitated his resignation about 1883, when he bought an
interest in the <i>Brisbane Telegraph</i>, and joined the literary

trade in the office of his uncle, the proprietor of the <i>Hastings
and St. Leonards Gazette</i>. He left for New Zealand with the
Non-conformist special settlers in 1862, intending to settle upon
the land, but on arrival at Auckland the vessel was boarded by a
representative of the <i>Daily Southern Cross</i> in search of
compositors, and Mr. Brett was persuaded to accept an engagement on
that paper. Shortly afterwards he joined the reporting staff of the
<i>New Zealand Herald</i> and maintained his connection with that
journal till 1870, when for the sum of £90 he acquired a third
interest in the <i>Evening Star</i>, which had been recently
started by Mr. G. M. Reid, and was then in a struggling condition.
By the infusion of additional energy, and the employment of carrier
pigeons to supply the want of telegraphs in those days&mdash;this
being one of the most successful innovations in journalism
introduced by Mr. Brett&mdash;the <i>Star</i> forged ahead and
extinguished its evening rival. In Feb. 1876, Mr. Reid disposed of
his interest to Mr. Brett, the share of the third partner having
previously been acquired by the firm, Mr. Brett thus becoming sole
proprietor. He has since disposed of a partnership interest to Mr.
T. W. Leys, who succeeded Mr. Reid in the editorship of the paper,
which is commonly reported to have the largest circulation in New
Zealand. The second publishing venture of the firm was the
<i>Auckland Almanack and Provincial Handbook</i>, started in 1872;
and they have also established the <i>New Zealand Farmer and Bee

recently the <i>New Zealand Graphic</i>, Mr. Brett, who is a

<p><a name="A164" id="A164"></a><b>Brisbane, General Sir Thos.
Makdougall</b>, Bart., G.C.B., G.C.H., D.C.L., sometime Governor of
New South Wales, was descended from the ancient family of the
Brisbanes of Brisbane, Ayrshire, and was born on July 23rd, 1773,
at Brisbane House, Largs, the seat of his father, Thomas Brisbane,
his mother being Eleanor, daughter of Sir Wm. Bruce. He entered the
army in 1789 as ensign in the 38th Infantry, stationed in Ireland,
where he became acquainted with the Duke of Wellington, then a
lieutenant in a cavalry regiment. In 1793 Captain Brisbane took
part in all the affairs of the Flanders campaign from St. Amand to
Nimeguen, and in 1796 he served in the West Indies, under Sir Ralph
Abercromby. In 1810 he was appointed Assistant Adjutant-General to
the staff at Canterbury, which he held till he obtained command of
a brigade under the Duke of Wellington, whom he joined at Coimbra
in 1812, and under whom he served during the remainder of the
Peninsular war. At the battle of the Nive he highly distinguished
himself, and for his bravery received the thanks of Parliament. In
1813, on the recommendation of the Duke of Wellington, Sir Thomas
was appointed to a command in Canada, and in 1821 was nominated to
succeed General Macquarie as Governor of New South Wales, where he
remained four years, viz., from Dec. 1821 to Dec. 1825. In New
South Wales he improved the condition of the convicts, substituting
useful labour for the treadmill and giving them tickets of leave
for good conduct. He was mainly, however, a man of science, and
established an observatory at Parramatta, where he is said to have
fixed the positions of and catalogued 7,385 stars, hitherto
scarcely known to astronomers. For his work "The Brisbane Catalogue
of Stars" he received the Copley medal from the Royal Society, and
the universities of Cambridge and Oxford conferred on him honorary
degrees. During his term of office in New South Wales, he
introduced good breeds of horses into the colony at his own
expense, and encouraged the cultivation of the sugar-cane, vines,
tobacco, and cotton. His government is memorable as inaugurating
free immigration on a large scale. To arrivals who paid their
passages to the Colony he gave every encouragement to settle. He
conferred on them grants of land, and assigned to them as many
prisoners as they were able to employ. Very speedily, as Mr. Blair
narrates, the fine lands of the colony were covered with flocks and
herds, and the applications for prisoners became so numerous that
at one time two thousand more were demanded than could be supplied.
Hence began an important change in the colony. The costly
Government farms were one after another broken up, and the
prisoners assigned to the squatters. The unremunerative public
works were abandoned, which all tended to good, as when the
convicts were thus scattered they were more manageable and more
likely to reform, than when gathered in large crowds. In
Macquarie's time not one prisoner in ten could be usefully
employed; seven or eight years after, there was not a prisoner in
the colony whose services were not eagerly sought and well paid for
by the squatters. The area of cleared land was thus doubled, and
the export of wool quintupled. Financially, however, he was not an
administrative success, and this led to his early recall. On his
return from Australia, Sir Thomas established an astronomical and
magnetic observatory at Makerstown, and published three large
volumes of observations in the "Transactions of the Royal Society
of Edinburgh." He was created a baronet in 1836 and G.C.B. in 1837,
and in 1841 was made a general in the army. On the death of Sir
Walter Scott he was also elected President of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh. He founded two gold medals as rewards for scientific
merit in connection with the Royal Society and the Society of Arts
respectively. He died at his residence, Brisbane House, Largs,
Ayrshire, on Jan. 27th, 1860. The capital of the colony of
Queensland is named after him. Sir Thomas married, in 1819, Anna
Maria, daughter of Sir Henry Hay Makdougall, but left no surviving
issue. During his peninsular campaigns he took regular observations
with a pocket sextant, and, as the Duke of Wellington said, "kept
the time of the army." As showing his ruling bent, it is related of
him that, whilst sheathing his sword after the Battle of Vittoria,
he exclaimed, looking round from a lofty eminence, "What a glorious
site for an observatory!"</p>

the late Alexander Britton, and brother of Henry Britton
(<i>q.v.</i>), embraced journalism, and was sub-editor of the
Melbourne <i>Argus</i>, and subsequently of the <i>Sydney Morning
Herald</i>. In 1890 he was engaged by the Government of New South
Wales to complete the official "History of New South Wales," the
first volume of which had been edited by Mr. G. B. Barton
(<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><a name="A166" id="A166"></a><b>Britton, Henry</b>, journalist,
second son of Alexander and Lydia Britton, was born on Jan. 24th,
1846, in Derby, England, where his father was engaged in tuition,
was also a contributor to the press, and had some repute as a
public lecturer. The subject of this notice emigrated to Australia
with his family in Nov. 1854, and reached Melbourne in Feb. 1855.
He at once proceeded to Castlemaine, Victoria, where his father
established a newspaper called <i>The Miners' Right</i>,
subsequently named <i>The Castlemaine Advertiser</i>. He learned
the business of a journalist in his father's office. In 1863 he
joined the parliamentary reporting staff of the <i>Age</i>
newspaper, Melbourne. Two years later he transferred his services
to the <i>Argus</i>, Melbourne. In 1870 he acted as special
correspondent for the <i>Argus</i> in Fiji. The series of letters
he wrote was republished under the title of "Fiji in 1870," and the
volume had a large sale. In Dec. 1871, as special correspondent of
the <i>Argus</i>, he accompanied the Australian Eclipse Expedition
to Cape York, northern coast of Australia, where observations of
the total eclipse of the sun were made. His account of the
proceedings of the expedition was afterwards republished in
<i>Nature</i>, the London scientific journal. In 1873 he went to
Fiji again as special commissioner for the <i>Argus</i> to inquire
into the working of the South Pacific labour trade, in connection
with which many scandals had arisen. The notorious brig <i>Carl</i>
had kidnapped a number of South Sea Islanders under circumstances
of great atrocity. The Australian Governments agreed to pay the
expense of returning the kidnappees to their several homes in the
islands. One of the vessels commissioned for this purpose by
Commodore Stirling was <i>H.M. schooner Alacrity</i>. Mr. Britton
was allowed a passage in this vessel with some fifty or sixty of
the savages, and he assisted at their landing under circumstances
of considerable danger at their various homes in the Marshall,
Gilbert, and Ellice groups of islands, north and south of the line.
In 1874 he was again called upon in the capacity of special
correspondent of the <i>Argus</i> to go to Fiji in the suite of Sir
Hercules Robinson, the then Governor of New South Wales, who had
made a request that he might be sent on the occasion of the
annexation of that country. Mr. Britton was present at the official
interviews with Thakombau and the other leading chiefs, and he
fully described the annexation ceremonies, which included many
incidents of peculiar interest. Mr. Britton was also acting at this
time as special correspondent for the <i>Times</i>. In 1877 he was
made chief of the <i>Argus</i> reporting staff and sub-editor.
Falling into bad health, and having a desire to visit the old
country, which he had not seen since infancy, he in 1878 made a
voyage round the world. Returning to Melbourne, after a year's
absence, he resumed his connection with the <i>Argus</i>, to which
he contributed a series of social sketches under the signature of
"Marcellus," and also a series of papers explaining the <i>modus
operandi</i> of the medical clairvoyants of Melbourne. Early in
1883 he joined the contributing staffs of the <i>Age</i> and
<i>Leader</i>. At the end of that year he published a romance
called "Loloma," illustrative of cannibal life among the Fijians in
the olden time. At the general election of 1886, he sought
parliamentary honours at the hands of the electors of Castlemaine,
but was not successful. In Nov. 1889 the proprietors of the
<i>Leader</i> offered prizes for the two best locally produced
Christmas stories for publication in their Christmas number; there
was a very large number of competitors, and Mr. Britton was awarded
the first prize for his story "Jack Travis's Merry Christmas: a
Tale of Australian Adventure." In March 1890 Mr. Britton was
appointed dramatic editor of the <i>Australasian</i>, and he still
holds that position.</p>

<p><a name="A171" id="A171"></a><b>Brooke, Gustavus Vaughan</b>,
the well-known actor, was the son of Gustavus Vaughan Brooke of
Dublin, was born on April 25th, 1818, at Hardwick Place, Dublin,
and was educated at a school conducted by the brother of Maria
Edgeworth. When about fifteen he applied to Calcraft of the Theatre
Royal, Dublin, for an engagement; and owing to the sudden
indisposition of Edmund Kean he was allowed to appear as William
Tell on Easter Monday (April 9th) 1833. Permanent employment
followed. He subsequently made his first appearance in London as
Virginius at the Victoria Theatre, and in 1840 he entered into an
engagement with Macready to appear at Drury Lane, but threw it up
through dissatisfaction with his part. His real <i>début</i> in
London took place on Jan. 3rd, 1848, when he appeared as Othello at
the Olympic, and scored a great success with the public as well as
with critics of judgment. Later on he went to America, and played
Othello at the Broadway Theatre, New York, on Dec. 15th, 1851. His
success in the States led him to take the Astor Place Opera House
in New York, which he opened in May 1852. The venture was a
disastrous failure, and after a fresh tour in the States he
reappeared at Drury Lane, then under the management of E. T. Smith,
the father of the Hon. L. L. Smith of Victoria (<i>q.v.</i>). Mr.
George Coppin visited England in 1854 with the view of engaging
"stars" for Australia, and amongst others secured G. V. Brooke who
from 1855 to 1857 received as much as £100 a night for playing in
Australia and New Zealand. He went into partnership with Coppin in
the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, and the Melbourne Cremorne, with
results so disastrous that both were beggared, and dissolved
partnership in Feb. 1859, when Brooke returned to England to find
his prospects far from bright. His reappearance at Drury Lane as
Othello was a failure, habits of dissipation having left their
deteriorating traces on his once fine presence and splendid voice.
Brooke married Miss Avonia Jones, an actress of no great merit.
Disgusted by his ill success in London, Brooke decided to return to
Australia, and took his passage in the ill-fated ship
<i>London</i>, which foundered in the Bay of Biscay on Jan. 11th,
1866. Brooke was amongst those who perished, his manly and even
heroic conduct during the long agony which preceded the final
sinking of the vessel being such as to shed lustre over a career
which, in its later phases, had been clouded by a deplorable
absence of self-control.</p>

<p><a name="A172" id="A172"></a><b>Brooke, Hon. John Henry</b>, who
was Commissioner of Crown Lands in Victoria under the Heales
administration from Nov. 1860 to Nov. 1861, will long be remembered
in connection with the land system of that colony. In 1857, as a
member of the Assembly, he was prominent in opposition to the
Haines Land Bill, which proposed giving annual licences to the
squatters. On his own accession to office he, in conjunction with
his colleagues Mr. J. M. Grant and Mr. Ireland, the
Attorney-General, brought into operation the famous licences to
occupy the waste lands of the Crown, which formed the basis of
popular settlement for cultivation purposes on the public lands of
Victoria. The scheme was formulated by a mere <i>Gazette</i>
notice, the issue of which was formally censured by the Legislative
Council. As the result of a dissolution of the Assembly Mr.
Brooke's policy was approved by the country, and formed the subject
of express eulogy in the Governor's opening speech to the new
Parliament in August 1861. The occupation licences were approved by
the new Assembly and again condemned by the Council, who denounced
the introduction of the new departure by a mere departmental
regulation as a breach of the principles of responsible government.
The Governor regretted the disapprobation of the Council, but when
they entreated that the legality of the licences might be tested in
the Supreme Court, replied that his advisers were "satisfied of
their legality." Mr. Brooke subsequently left Victoria, and is now
a resident in Japan.</p>

Napier</b>, K.C.M.G., eldest son of the late Rev. Frederick Broome,
rector of Kenley, Salop, by his wife Catherine Eleanor, eldest
daughter of Lieut-Col. Napier, formerly Superintendent Indian
Department, Canada, was born in Canada, on Nov. 18th, 1842, and
educated at Whitchurch Grammar School, Salop. He emigrated to New
Zealand in 1857, and engaged in pastoral pursuits. Visiting England
in 1864, he married on June 21st, 1865, Mary Anne, widow of the
late Col. Sir George Barker, R.A., K.C.B. (<i>q.v.</i>). Returning
the same year to his New Zealand sheep-station, in the Malvern
Hills, province of Canterbury, he continued colonial life for a
time; but finally left New Zealand for London in 1869, and for the
six following years contributed largely to the <i>Times</i>
newspaper, acting as correspondent for that journal at the Duke of
Edinburgh's marriage at St. Petersburg, and on many other
occasions, and furnishing numerous literary reviews, art
criticisms, and miscellaneous articles to the columns of the
leading journal, then edited by the late Mr. John Delane. He
published two volumes of verse, "Poems from New Zealand" (1868) and
"The Stranger of Seriphos" (1869), and contributed verse to the
<i>Cornhill</i>, <i>Macmillan's Magazine</i>, and other
periodicals. He was appointed, in 1870, Secretary to the St. Paul's
Cathedral Completion Fund, and in 1873 Secretary to the Royal
Commission on Unseaworthy Ships, and held for some time a
commission in the Essex yeomanry. He was selected by the late Earl
of Carnarvon, in 1875, to proceed with Lord (then Sir Garnet)
Wolseley on a special mission to Natal, as Colonial Secretary of
that colony. He hold that post until 1878, when he was promoted to
the Colonial Secretaryship of Mauritius, where he administered the
government in 1879, and was Lieutenant-Governor of the island from
1880 to 1888. On receiving the news of the disaster at Isandula, he
despatched at once to the assistance of Lord Chelmsford nearly the
whole of the garrison of the colony. For this service he was warmly
thanked by the Governor and High Commissioner of the Cape Colony
(the late Sir Bartle Frere), and by the colony off Natal through
its Lieut.-Governor, Sir Henry Bulwer, his action being also fully
approved by Her Majesty's Government. He was appointed on Dec.
14th, 1882, Governor of Western Australia, and assumed office in
June 1883. Sir Frederick was created C.M.G. in 1877, K.C.M.G. in
1884; and visited England in 1885, when, with the "view of
extending a knowledge of the resources of what was at that time a
little known colony, he read a paper on "Western Australia" before
the Colonial Institute, H.R.H. the Prince of Wales taking the
chair. Sir Frederick Broome's term of government of Western
Australia was marked by a great extension of railways and
telegraphs, and much general progress. The question of a change of
the constitution of the colony to the form known as responsible
government having come forward, it became Sir Frederick's duty to
act as intermediary between the Legislative Council and the
Secretary of State. After considerable correspondence the details
of the new constitution were settled, and a bill, approved by Her
Majesty's Government, finally passed the local legislature in 1889.
Imperial parliamentary sanction being required for the transfer of
the Crown lands to the Colonial Legislature, the necessary bill was
at once introduced by Lord Knutsford, and passed the House of
Lords; but, owing to a strong opposition to handing over the
immense tract of Crown lands to the colonists, which suddenly
showed itself in the home press and in the House of Commons, the
bill could not be proceeded with in the House in 1889, and had to
be deferred to the following year. To clear up the extraordinary
misapprehensions which existed on the matter, Sir Frederick Broome
addressed a letter to the <i>Times</i>, which had a considerable
effect. A good deal of determined opposition to the bill, however,
continued; and Sir Frederick and two leading members of the Western
Australian Legislature came to England, in Dec. 1889, at the wish
of the colony and with Lord Knutsford's concurrence, to give
evidence before the select committee of the House of Commons, to
which, early in the session of 1890, the Constitution Bill was
referred. The whole facts of the case were most fully explained to
the select committee by Sir Frederick Broome and the other
witnesses, the blue book containing the report of the evidence
being a complete compendium of information respecting Western
Australia. The commission reported, much to the surprise of the
London press, in favour of the bill and of the transfer of all
lands to the colony. Opposition was at length overcome, or nearly
so. The Government stood firm, and had the support of the front
Opposition bench; and after some applications of the closure, Sir
Frederick Broome had the satisfaction of witnessing the passage of
the bill through committee with all restrictions erased, the whole
of the lands of the vast territory&mdash;1,060,000 square miles in
extent&mdash;being freely handed over to the Legislature of Western
Australia, which thus obtained its new constitution on the same
basis as the other colonies of the continent, there being no
opposition to the bill in the House of Lords. On quitting Western
Australia, in Dec. 1889, for the mission to England in connection
with the Constitution Bill, Sir Frederick and Lady Broome received
many proofs of the esteem and regard of the colonists. Sir
Frederick's tenure of the government of Western Australia came to
an end with his mission to England, and finally ceased in Sept
1890. In July 1891 he was appointed Governor of Trinidad.</p>

followed by "Stories About," "Ribbon Stories," "A Christmas Cake,"
"A Year's Housekeeping in Natal," "Letters to Guy," descriptive of
life in Western Australia, and other works. She published a useful
manual in 1874, entitled "First Principles of Cookery," and was
appointed Lady Superintendent of the National School of Cookery at
South Kensington, a post she relinquished on accompanying her
husband to Natal in 1875. Her next home was in Mauritius, 1878-83,

Academy and at Glasgow University, where he graduated M.A. in 1869.
Having gained the Snell Exhibition in English Language, Literature,

1870; but ill-health prevented him from completing his course, and
in 1874, when Canterbury College, Christchurch, was founded in
affiliation to the University of New Zealand, he was selected to
fill the chair of Classics and English. In 1879 Mr. Brown resigned
the chair of Classics, and became Professor of English and English
History. In the same year he was a member of the Royal Commission
on the state of higher education in New Zealand, and was appointed
Fellow of the University Senate. He was one of the founders of the
short-lived <i>New Zealand Magazine</i> in 1875. In 1886 Mr. Brown
married Miss Helen Connon, one of the first lady graduates in Her
Majesty's dominions.</p>

M.H.A., J.P., son of Richard Brown, was born at Hobart in 1838, was
educated at the Hutchins School, Hobart, and has since been engaged
in pastoral pursuits. He has been member for the Cumberland
District in the Tasmanian House of Assembly since Jan. 1875. He was
Minister of Lands and Works in the first Fysh Ministry from August
1877 to Dec. 1878, and held the same post in the Giblin Ministry
from Dec. 1882 to August 1884, and in the Douglas and Agnew
Ministries from that date till March 1887. Mr. Brown was one of the
representatives of Tasmania at the Sydney Convention of 1883, at
which the draft of the Federal Council Bill was agreed to. In March
1886 he was appointed one of the Tasmanian representatives in the
Federal Council; but when the Fysh Ministry came into power he was
objected to as a political opponent, and has not since taken his
seat. In March 1891 Mr. Brown was one of the representatives of
Tasmania at the Sydney Federation Convention. In July 1891 he was
elected Speaker of the House of Assembly in succession to Mr.
Reibey.</p>

eldest son of Sir William Brown, 9th baronet, of Coulston,
Haddingtonshire, who resided in New South Wales, and died in 1882,
when the present Sir William succeeded him as 10th baronet. The
latter was born in Dec. 1848, and married, in 1871, Alice Jane,
daughter of J. C. Peters, merchant, Hope House, Manby Beach, near
Sydney. He resides at Tareela, Barraba, N.S.W.</p>

<p><a name="A181" id="A181"></a><b>Browne, Thomas Alexander (Rolf
Boldrewood)</b>, the eldest son of the late Captain Sylvester John
Browne, of the East India Company's Service, and of Enmore, N.S.W.,
and Hartlands, Victoria, by his marriage with Eliza Angell
Alexander, was born in England on August 6th, 1826. He arrived in
New South Wales with his father in April 1830, and was educated at
Mr. T. W. Cape's school in Sydney, and afterwards at Sydney
College, when Mr. Cape was appointed head-master and transferred
his scholars. Mr. T. A. Browne, when about seventeen years of age,
started with a herd of cattle for the Port Fairy district, in
Victoria (then only partially explored), and became a pioneer
squatter there, forming the station known as Squattlesea Mere. Here
he remained until 1856. He visited England in 1860, returning in
1861. Having sold his property in Victoria, he, in 1864, took up a
sheep station on the Murrumbidgee. The droughts of 1866 and 1868
were terribly severe, and Mr. Browne's losses were so heavy that he
was compelled in 1869 to give up squatting. In 1870 he was made a
Police Magistrate and Goldfields Commissioner in New South Wales,
and is now Police Magistrate and Warden of Goldfields at Gulgong,
Dubbo, Armidale and Albury, in that colony. Mr. Browne contributed
to the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> as far back as 1865, and many tales
and sketches from his pen appeared in the colonial press. In 1888
his "Robbery under Arms," which originally appeared in the
<i>Sydney Mail</i>, was republished in London under the pseudonym
"Rolf Boldrewood," and proved a remarkable success. Since then Mr.
Browne has republished in England "The Squatter's Dream," "A
Colonial Reformer," and "A Miner's Right," all issued by Messrs.
Macmillan &amp; Co. in 1890. All have had a favourable reception;
and the same may be said of "A Sydney-side Saxon" and "Nevermore,"
published in 1891 and 1892 respectively. Mr. Browne, whose father
and brother Sylvester were, like himself, pioneer squatters, was
married at Mulgoa, Penrith, N.S.W., on August 1st, 1860, to Miss
Margaret Maria Biley.</p>

<p><a name="A182" id="A182"></a><b>Browne, Sir Thomas Gore</b>,
K.C.M.G., C.B., the son of Robert Browne, of Morton House, Bucks,
and brother to the late Bishop of Winchester, was born in 1807. In
1823 he entered the 28th Regiment, and for some time acted as
aide-de-camp to Lord Nugent, Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian
Islands, of which he was also Colonial Secretary. In 1836 he
exchanged into the 41st Regiment, which he commanded as major
during the Afghan campaign. He was among those who advanced to the
rescue of General Nott after the massacre at Khyber Pass; and was
in charge of his regiment also at Hykulzie, Candahar, Ghuznee, and
Cabal. He was in command of the rear during the march through the
Khyber Pass, and also at the storming of the Nik fort at Issaliff.
For his services he was promoted in 1836 to a lieutenant-colonelcy,
and was made a C.B. On his return to England he exchanged into the
21st Fusiliers, which he commanded until 1851, when he was made
Governor of St. Helena. In 1854 he left St. Helena to become
Governor of New Zealand at the critical time when the Home
Government had decided to grant the colony responsible government.
It was during Colonel Gore Browne's tenure of office that the
settlers' difficulties with the Maoris came to a head in New
Zealand. A certain party among the natives had met what they
considered the encroachments of the English with the establishment
of a king, and the refusal to sell their lands. In the Waitara
district a native named Teira offered, however, to sell a block;
and the Governor, who had determined that a strong front was
necessary in dealing with the Maoris, insisted upon buying, despite
the opposition of Wiremu Kingi and the King party. This was the
origin of the Taranaki war; but it was hardly begun when the Home
Government, finding itself on the verge of the precipice, recalled
Sir George Grey from the Cape to replace Colonel Browne, who was
removed to Tasmania, taking office on Dec. 10th, 1861. On Dec.
30th, 1868, he resigned the Governorship of Tasmania, was created
K.C.M.G., and in 1870 was appointed Governor of the Bermudas,
retiring on a pension in 1871. He married, in 1851, a daughter of
James Campbell, of Craigie. Sir Thomas Gore Browne, who died on
April 17th, 1887, was a member of the New Zealand Commission in
London for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition of 1886.</p>

C.M.G., LL.D., M.D., F.R.C.S., Chancellor of the University of
Melbourne, is the only son of the late Anthony Brownless, of
Paynetts House, and Bockingfold Manor, Goudhurst, Kent. After
studying for the medical profession at St. Bartholomew's Hospital
in London, and at the University of Liege, he was admitted M.R.C.S.
of London in 1841, and M.D. of St. Andrews in 1846. Having
practised for some years as a physician in London, Dr. Brownless
arrived in Victoria in Dec. 1852, and was soon afterwards elected
Physician to the Melbourne Benevolent Asylum, and in 1854 Physician
to the Melbourne Hospital&mdash;a post which he held for twelve
years, being appointed a Life Governor and Consulting Physician on
his retirement. In June 1855 the Melbourne University gave him the
diploma of M.D., this being the first occasion on which the degree
was conferred by that University, in which Dr. Brownless founded
the medical school, and of which he was annually elected
Vice-Chancellor for twenty-nine years, from 1858 to 1887; when he
was elected Chancellor, in succession to Dr. Moorhouse. Dr.
Brownless holds the honorary degree of LL.D. of the Universities of
St. Andrews and Melbourne, and in 1884 he was elected a Fellow of
the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Dr. Brownless was made, a
Knight of St. Gregory the Great by the late Pope in 1870, and a
Knight Commander of the Order of Pius, conferring nobility, by Leo.
XIII. in 1883. Dr. Brownless, who was created C.M.G. in May 1888,
has been twice married: first, in 1842, to Ellen, daughter of the
late William Hawker, M.D., of Charing, Kent, and Liége, Belgium,
formerly surgeon in the Grenadier Guards, who died in 1846; and
secondly, in 1852, to Anne Jane, eldest daughter of the late

April 26th, 1881, Alice, daughter of R. L. Waters, Dublin. He
entered the army as ensign in the Rifle Brigade in April 1861, and
became lieutenant in 1865, captain in 1873, and major in 1881.
Major Brownrigg, who passed the final examination at the Staff
College in 1875, distinguished himself in the Afghan campaign of
1878 and 1879, being mentioned in despatches and given brevet rank
as major. He was employed with the local forces in Victoria from
Sept. 1883 to Sept. 1888, when he succeeded Colonel Disney as
commandant, with the local rank of lieutenant-colonel. This
position he held till Nov. 1889, when he returned to England, and
has since been employed in India.</p>

twenty years Staff-officer of Pensioners and Commandant of Western
Australia. He was Acting Governor of the colony in Feb. 1862, and
from Nov. 1868 to Sept. 1869, during the interim between the

Cornwall Railway, Chief Engineer of the Punjab Railway in 1865, and
District Engineer of Railways in Southland, New Zealand, in 1871.
Mr. Brunton, who died at Wellington, New Zealand, on June 13th,
1881, invented an apparatus for washing and separating ores from
their matrix, known as "Brunton's Endless Cloth," and also a
fuse-making machine, the secret of which has never been divulged,
but which at once reduced the selling price of fuse by 75 per cent

<p><a name="A188" id="A188"></a><b>Bryce, Hon. John</b>, is one of
the oldest settlers in New Zealand, having been brought to the
colony as a child in 1840. He came into prominence during the Maori
war, and was lieutenant in a troop of yeomanry cavalry at the time
of the Hauhau advance upon Wanganui. It was on this occasion that
an incident occurred which was made the foundation of a grave
charge against Mr. Bryce by Mr. G. W. Rusden (<i>q.v.</i>) in his
<i>History of New Zealand</i>. While Lieutenant Bryce, with his
cavalry, was patrolling to the north of Wanganui, a number of
Maoris were observed looting farm-buildings, and a sortie was made
upon them by the troops. It was asserted by Mr. Rusden, from
information alleged to have been communicated through Bishop
Hadfield and Sir Arthur Gordon, that Mr. Bryce dashed upon native
women and children, "cutting them down gleefully and with ease."
Subsequently, Mr. Bryce went to England, and brought an action for
libel against Mr. Rusden, when the jury awarded him, £5000 damages,
as it was proved in evidence that there were no women present, and
that the charge against Mr. Bryce was completely baseless. The late
Baron Huddleston presided at the trial, and Sir John Gorst appeared
for Mr. Rusden. In 1871 Mr. Bryce entered Parliament as member for
Wanganui, and on Oct. 8th, 1879, he accepted office under Sir John
Hall as Minister for Native Affairs. About this time a
<i>tokunga</i> (priest) named Te Whiti had began to give the
Government some trouble by his resistance to settlement and claims
to independent and supernatural power. As he had collected in his
<i>pa</i> a large number of natives whose attitude was threatening,
Mr. Bryce deemed the time had come for energetic action. Not being
able to persuade his colleagues to agree with him, he retired from
the Ministry, though continuing to give it a general support. Nine
months afterwards he rejoined the Hall Government to carry out the
native policy he had formerly unsuccessfully urged upon his
colleagues. On Nov. 5th, 1881, he occupied Parihaka with a large
force consisting of the armed constabulary and volunteers, and
arrested Te Whiti and Tohu, one of his chief followers, as well as
a notorious murderer named Hiroki, who was afterwards executed. The
action was much criticised at the time. Mr. Bryce continued to hold
office in the Atkinson and Whitaker Ministries till August 16th,
1884. In 1882 he carried through the House "The West Coast Peace
Preservation Bill" by which Te Whiti and Tohu were imprisoned
during Her Majesty's pleasure. He also passed the Amnesty Bill,
which granted an amnesty to natives who had committed crimes during
the war. By the provisions of this bill the notorious Te Kooti
obtained a free pardon. Mr. Bryce was re-elected for Wanganui in
1890, and led the opposition to the Ballance Ministry. In Sept.
1891, however, he resigned his seat in the House, owing to a vote
of censure having been passed upon certain expressions used by him
in debate reflecting on the conduct of the Premier, and which he
(Mr. Bryce) regarded as in no sense unparliamentary or
objectionable.</p>

<p><a name="A189" id="A189"></a> <b>Buchanan, Hon. David</b>,
M.L.C., fifth son of William Buchanan, of Edinburgh, advocate, was
born in that city in 1832, and educated at the High School there.
He emigrated to Australia in 1852, and entered the New South Wales
Legislative Assembly as member for Morpeth in 1860, and was elected
twice for East Macquarie, which he represented from 1863 to 1866.
He went to England in 1867, and entered at the Middle Temple in
November of that year, being called to the bar in June 1869. He
then returned to New South Wales, and practised his profession,
being elected to the Legislative Assembly for East Sydney in 1870,
and twice returned for the Goldfields. Though outvoted at Mudgee in
1879, he was ultimately declared duly elected. As a politician Mr.
Buchanan gained prominence by his sturdy championship of fiscal
protection. He revisited England in 1886, and published a selection
from his orations and speeches. Having unsuccessfully contested
Balmain at the general election in Jan. 1889, he was nominated to
the Legislative Council. He died on April 3rd, 1890.</p>

<p><a name="A190" id="A190"></a> <i>Buckley, William</i>, known as
the "Wild White Man," was a native of Macclesfield, England, where
he was born about 1780. He was originally a bricklayer, but entered
the Cheshire Militia, and subsequently the Fourth or King's Own
Regiment of the Line. For some act of mutiny, or, as other
authorities state, for receiving stolen goods, he was sentenced to
transportation, and was sent to Australia by H.M.S.
<i>Calcutta</i>, with the convict party which landed at Port
Phillip (afterwards Victoria) under Collins in 1803. Whilst engaged
in forming what proved an abortive settlement, Buckley and two
convict comrades escaped into the bush, a third being shot in the
attempt to do so. The escapees only mustered a trifling supply of
rations&mdash;a gun, some tin pots and a kettle, and were soon worn
out with fatigue and hunger, and the fear of being murdered by the
Blacks. From Swan Island they took a view of the <i>Calcutta</i>,
and so tired were they of their newly acquired freedom that they
signalled their late taskmasters, with a view of returning to
bondage rather than endure any longer the isolation and terrors of
their lot. They could not, however, make themselves observed, and
Buckley's two comrades decided to skirt along the shore with the
view of regaining the <i>Calcutta</i> from the spot where they had
made their escape. They both, however, perished, whether by hunger
or otherwise is not known. Buckley, thus left alone, was, Blair
states, preserved by a lucky accident working on the superstitions
of the natives. A chief of one of the aboriginal tribes had been
buried near Buckley's temporary hut, a piece of a spear being left
by his sorrowing subjects to mark the grave. Buckley appropriated
the fragment, and meeting some members of the tribe, whilst
carrying it in his hand, they joyfully hailed him as their dead
chief returned to life in a new guise. He was well cared for,
learnt the language of his new associates, and married a black
woman. He lived with the natives in all the freedom of bush life
till July 12th, 1835, when he was discovered by Batman, the founder
of Melbourne. He acted as interpreter and peacemaker between his
fellow countrymen and his native associates. A free pardon being
subsequently given him, he went to live in Hobart Town, Tasmania,
where he married a white woman. When he grew old the Governments of
Victoria and Tasmania gave him a modest allowance of a pound a
week. He died at Hobart Town on Feb. 2nd, 1856. Buckley was a man
of gigantic stature, and proportionately strong. He had nearly
forgotten his own language when Batman discovered him, but he
gradually recovered its full use after his return to English
associations.</p>

<p><a name="A191" id="A191"></a> Buckland, Rev. John Richard, son
of the Rev. John Buckland, Rector of Templeton, Devonshire, and a
nephew of Dr. William Buckland, Dean of Westminster, was born on
August 3rd, 1819. He received his early education from his father
at Laleham, and was then sent to Rugby, of which school his uncle,
Dr. Arnold, was at the time head master. At the age of seventeen he
went to Oxford, where he held a studentship at Christ Church. After
taking his degree he determined to emigrate to the colonies, and
sailed for New Zealand, but in consequence of the unsettled state
of affairs in that colony he removed to Tasmania, arriving in
Hobart in Feb, 1843. He was for a time second master of the Queen's
School, of which the Rev. J. P. Gell was head master. On the
closing of that school he opened a private school. In 1845 he was
ordained. In 1846 the prospectus of a Church of England Grammar
School was issued, and on August 3rd in that year the school, named
"The Hutchins School" in memory of Archdeacon Hutchins, was opened
at Hobart, with Mr. Buckland as head master. It soon became one of
the leading schools of the colony, a position which it has ever
since maintained, a large number of the most prominent men of
Tasmania having received their education at the Hutchins School.
Mr. Buckland held the post of head master for twenty-eight years,
until his death, which took place at Hobart on Oct. 13th, 1874.</p>

Alphonsus</b>, K.C.M.G., M.L.C., Attorney-General, New Zealand, is
the second son of the late C. Buckley, and was born near Castle
Townsend, in county Cork, in 1841. He received his primary
education in the well-known Mansion House in the city of Cork, and
was afterward at college in Paris till he entered the University of
Louvain in Belgium. While in Louvain Count Carlo Macdonell, Private
Chamberlain to the Pope, in passing through, selected young Buckley
to conduct the recruits for the Irish Papal Brigade from Ostend to
Vienna. There he gave them over to the papal authorities, who were
waiting to receive them. After the Piedmontese had taken possession
of the Papal States, Mr. Buckley returned to his college, and after
completing his studies, went home to Ireland. From thence he
emigrated to Queensland, where shortly after his arrival he
completed his legal studies under the supervision of the present
Chief Justice, Sir Charles Lilley. Mr. Buckley was also admitted to
the Victorian Bar. After a short residence in Queensland he settled
in New Zealand, and commenced practice in Wellington in partnership
with Mr. W. S. Reid, the present Solicitor-General; but he is now
the head of the well-known legal firm of Buckley, Stafford and
Treadwell. Shortly after his arrival in Wellington he entered the
Provincial Council. He was Provincial Solicitor for the last
administration under that <i>régime</i> until the abolition of the
provinces. He was called to the Legislative Council of New Zealand
in 1878, and in Sept. 1884 became Colonial Secretary in the
Stout-Vogel administration, and leader of the Upper House. He
retired with his colleagues in Oct. 1887. In Jan. 1891, on the
return of the liberal party to power, Mr. Buckley joined the
administration under Mr. Ballance as Attorney-General, and resumed
the leadership in the Legislative Council, where he had to confront
a decidedly hostile majority. Mr. Buckley has taken a warm interest
in the volunteer movement, and was for six years captain of the
present D Battery of Wellington (then known as No. 1), which was
raised by himself. Mr. Buckley married Alice, the only daughter of
the late Hon. Sir William Fitzherbert, K.C.M.G. (<i>q.v.</i>). On
May 25th, 1892, he was gazetted K.C.M.G.</p>

successfully in pastoral pursuits, but was ruined in the crisis
caused by the dishonour of Governor Gawler's drafts. He went to the
Victorian gold diggings in 1852, but returned to Adelaide the next
year, when he became manager of Mr. Osmond Gilles' Glen Osmond
property, where he established a vineyard, one of the first in the
colony. In 1842 he invented a locomotive steam-threshing machine,
and in 1882 was voted £250 by the South Australian Parliament for
his improvements in agricultural machinery. He was the author of

family and the eldest surviving son of the late Rev. James Buller,
was born on Oct. 9th, 1838, at Newark, Bay of Islands, N.Z., and
was educated at Wesley College, Auckland. Having early acquired a
knowledge of the Maori language, he was appointed Government
interpreter at Wellington in 1855, and started and edited a weekly
Maori paper called <i>Te Karere o Poneke</i>. In 1859 he was made
Native Commissioner for the Southern Provinces, and carried through
the partition and individualisation of the Kaiapoi Native Reserve.
In 1861 he acted as honorary secretary to the Kohimarama conference
of native chiefs, convened by Governor Gore Browne; and in the same
year edited the <i>Maori Messenger</i>, a fortnightly paper in
English and Maori, being afterwards also promoter and editor of the
<i>Maori Intelligencer</i> (both of them Government publications).
In April 1862 he was appointed Resident Magistrate of the Manawatu;
and in April 1865 Judge of the Native Land Court. In the same year
he was present at the taking of Wereroa Pa (Volunteer Staff), for
which he received the New Zealand War Medal. On that occasion,
declining the protection of a military escort, he carried the
Governor's despatches at night through forty miles of the enemy's
country, attended only by a Maori orderly, for which gallant
service he was mentioned in despatches. In 1866 he became Resident
Magistrate and Sheriff of Wanganui, which office he held till 1871,
when he went to England as Secretary to the Agent-General. For a
continuous period of fifteen years he had held various official
appointments, chiefly in connection with native affairs, and had on
eight different occasions received the special thanks of the
Colonial Government. He entered as a student at the Inner Temple on
Nov. 20th, 1871, and was called to the bar on June 6th, 1874. In
the same year he returned to New Zealand, and practised as a
barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court with remarkable
success till 1886, when he visited England as Commissioner in
connection with the Colonial and Indian Exhibition. For his
services on this occasion he was created K.C.M.G., having been made
a C.M.G. in 1875 in recognition of his researches in New Zealand
ornithology. In 1876 he was elected F.R.S. on the same account. Sir
Walter remained in England till 1890, and took an active part in
all public movements affecting the colonies. He was on the Mansion
House Committee for the Paris Exhibition 1889, and was elected a
member of the Executive Council. For his services on that occasion
he was decorated "Officier" in the Legion of Honour. As early as
1865 he obtained the silver medal of the New Zealand Exhibition for
an "Essay on the Ornithology of New Zealand"; and subsequently
published a splendidly illustrated "History of the Birds of New
Zealand." In 1882 he prepared for the Government a "Manual of the
Birds of New Zealand," and in 1888 brought out a second edition of
his larger work. Besides enjoying the dignity of a British order,
Sir Walter is a Knight (First Class) Austrian Order of Francis
Joseph, First Class Order of Frederick of Wurtemburg, Order of
Merit (First Class) of Hesse-Darmstadt, and "Officier de
l'Instruction Publique" (Gold Palm of the Academy). He has been
awarded the Galileian Medal by the Royal University of Florence,
and has received the honorary degree of Doctor of Science from the
University of Tubingen. In 1881 he received the gold medal of the
New Zealand Exhibition for science and literature, and was elected
a governor of the New Zealand Institute, of which he was also one
of the founders. He married, in 1862, Charlotte, third daughter of

Minister of Justice and Education in Mr. (now Sir) Arthur Blyth's
Government from July 1874 to March 1875, and Attorney-General in
that of Mr. (afterwards Sir) W. Morgan from Sept. 1878 to March
1881. In 1882 he received the Queen's permission to bear the title
of "Honourable" within the colony, and in 1884 was appointed a
judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia. Judge Bundey was for
six years captain of volunteers, and was commodore of the South
Australian Yacht Club from 1874 to 1884. He married in 1865 Ellen
Wardlaw, daughter of the Hon. Sir William Milne, late president of
the Legislative Council of South Australia.</p>

Eton. He entered as a student at Lincoln's Inn in March 1839, and
was called to the bar in May 1844. He emigrated to Victoria in
1852, with the object of making a fortune on the goldfields; but by
the advice of his friend, Vice-Chancellor Bacon, took his tools
with him in the shape of a law library. After some experience on
the Forest Creek diggings, he was admitted to the Victorian bar in
Oct. 1853, and commenced practice in Melbourne. He acquired a good
equity business, and was appointed a County Court Judge in 1873. In
October of the next year, however, he exchanged this post for that
of Commissioner of Titles, which he held till his death on June
2nd, 1885.</p>

<p><a name="A200" id="A200"></a><b>Burke, Robert O'Hara</b>, the
famous and ill-fated explorer, belonged to a younger branch of the
Burkes or de Burghs, and was the second son of John Hardiman Burke
of St. Clerans, co. Galway, Ireland, by Anne his wife, daughter of
Robert O'Hara of Raheen, co. Galway, and was born at St. Clerans in
1821. He was educated in Belgium. He entered the Austrian army in
1840, and rose to the rank of Captain. In 1848 he joined the Royal
Irish Constabulary, and in 1853 emigrated to Tasmania, whence he
soon went on to Victoria, where he became an Inspector of Police.
In 1854 (in which year his father died) he obtained leave to go to
England to settle his family affairs, and seek a Commission in the
Crimean War; but the war being over before arrangements were
concluded, he returned to Victoria, and resumed his police duties.
In 1860 he was appointed to the command of an exploring expedition,
organised under the auspices of a Committee of the Royal Society of
Victoria, and despatched for the purpose of crossing the Australian
continent from sea to sea, north and south. Great enthusiasm was
aroused by the project, and Mr. Ambrose Kyte, a Melbourne resident,
subscribed £1000 towards the expenses, this amount being handsomely
supplemented by private and Government contributions. A novel
feature was the employment of camels specially exported from India
for the purpose at a cost of £5500, and from which great results
were expected. The expedition, consisting of thirteen persons
besides the leader, started from Melbourne on August 20th, 1860,
amidst the cheers of thousands of spectators. Dissensions soon
arose, and several members of the party, including Landells, the
second in command, returned. Burke reached Cooper's Creek, which
was to be the starting point of the expedition, on Nov. 11th; and
after waiting long, with six companions, for the arrival of the
rest of the party who had been left behind at Menindie on the
Darling, made a dash for the Gulf of Carpentaria on Dec. 16th,
leaving the bulk of his stores in charge of an assistant named
Brahe and three men, with directions to await his return for three
or four months. The enterprise proved successful. Though not
actually coming within sight of the sea, Burke and his associate,
Wills, reached the tidal waters of the Flinders river, and earned
the distinction of being the first white men to traverse the
Australian continent. On their return to Cooper's Creek, however,
on April 21st, 1861, exhausted with hardships, and after one of
their number, Gray, had succumbed to fatigue and starvation, King
found that Brahe, interpreting his instructions too literally, had
abandoned his post that very day, leaving only a small stock of
provisions behind him. Contrary to the advice of Wills, who urged
the advisability of following in Brahe's tracks, Burke determined
to strike for some of the South Australian stations, which he
imagined were much nearer than was actually the case. He was
stopped on his course by want of water, and was obliged to return
with his two companions to Cooper's Creek. They were too enfeebled
to renew the attempt to go southwards, and were obliged to remain
on the lower part of Cooper's Creek, some distance from the depot,
subsisting mainly on casual supplies obtained from friendly
natives. In the meantime Brahe, with the lagging rearguard, had
returned to the depot, but not finding Burke and his party, went
south once more. The end came on June 28th, 1861, when Burke died
of starvation, Wills, whom Burke and King had left to go in search
of the blacks, dying about the same time. King, their only
surviving comrade, managed to subsist amongst the natives until
rescued on Sept. 21st by a relief party, under the command of Mr.
Alfred W. Howitt, which had been sent out from Melbourne when Brahe
returned with the news of Burke and Wills' non-return to the depot.
Mr. Howitt buried the ill-fated explorers, Burke having
particularly requested King not to bury him, but to let him lie
above ground with a pistol in his hand. Public feeling, however,
demanded the rescue of their remains, and they were recovered by a
second expedition sent out under Mr. Howitt, and brought back to
Melbourne on Dec. 28th, 1862. A public funeral was accorded to
these two brave but luckless explorers, on Jan. 21st, 1863, after
they had lain in state twenty days, and a monument to their memory,
the work of the Australian sculptor, Charles Summers, now occupies
a prominent position opposite the Parliament House, Melbourne. The
cost of the original expedition, and of the subsequent searches,
was estimated at £57,000.</p>

M.L.A. was born in the north of Ireland, and emigrated to New South
Wales at an early age. Having engaged in mercantile pursuits in the
Hunter River district, he was returned to the Assembly for the
Hunter in 1862, and represented the constituency for many years. He
is now one of the members for St. Leonard's. He was
Postmaster-General in the Robertson Ministry from Feb. 1875 to
March 1877, and in that of Mr. Farnell from Dec. 1877 to Dec. 1878.
He introduced postal cards into Australia in 1875, and was the
first to give employment to women in the telegraph department. In
1878 he arranged with the Governments of the other Australian
colonies and New Zealand for the duplication of the submarine cable
to Australia. Mr. Burns was Treasurer in the last Robertson
Ministry from Dec. 1885 to Feb. 1886, and in that of Sir Henry
Parkes from Jan. 1887 to Jan. 1889. He was gazetted a C.M.G. in the
Jubilee year, but declined the honour, and the appointment was
cancelled.</p>

<p><a name="A203" id="A203"></a><b>Burns, Rev. Thomas</b>, D.D.,
was born at Mossgiel, Ayrshire, Scotland, on April 10th, 1796. His
father, Gilbert Burns, was brother to the Scottish poet, Robert
Burns, and was factor to Lord Blantyre. While yet a child his
parents removed to the farm of Dinniny, Dumfriesshire. At the
parish school he received his primary education, proceeding in
course of time for the higher branches to the Grammar Schools of
Closeburn and Haddington. At the latter he was a pupil of the
famous Edward Irving, from whom he received a prize for proficiency
in mathematics. From the Grammar School at Haddington Mr. Burns
entered the University at Edinburgh, where he pursued with success
the arts curriculum, and attended the classes in theology
prescribed for candidates for the ministry of the Established
Church of Scotland. He was then taken on trial for licence by the
Presbytery of Haddington, and by it was duly licensed to preach as
a probationer of the Church of Scotland. He was at that time acting
as tutor in the family of Sir Hugh Dalrymple, Berwick House,
Haddington, through whose influence he obtained a presentation to
the parish of Ballantrae, in the Presbytery of Stranraer, Galloway,
where he was ordained by that Presbytery in 1825. From Ballantrae
he was translated to the parish of Monkton, Ayrshire, in 1830.
where he continued parish minister till the disruption of the
Church of Scotland in 1843, when he relinquished his status as a
minister of the Church of Scotland, and joined the Free Church of
Scotland which was then formed. For a short time he remained in
Monkton as Free Church minister, and helped largely to organise
other Free Churches In the Presbytery of Ayr. His attention having
been drawn to the proposal of the New Zealand Company to found a
Scotch colony in Otago, possessing the church and school privileges
peculiar to Scotland, and drawn from the membership of the Free
Church, and having received the offer of being appointed the first
minister of the projected colony, he resigned his charge at Monkton
with a view of proceeding to Otago in that capacity. Circumstances
having hindered the immediate realisation of the New Zealand
Company's scheme of colonisation, Mr. Burns spent a year or two in
giving lectures on the Company's plan, visiting for this purpose
various parts of Scotland, but receiving no remuneration from the
Company for this service. He accepted a call from the Free Church
congregation of Portobello, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, and
continued to act as minister there till October 1847. At that date
all arrangements for prosecuting the proposed settlement of Otago
having been completed, and Mr. Burns adhering to his appointment as
first minister of the colony, he demitted his charge, and made
ready to proceed with the outgoing emigrants to Otago. With his
family, he joined at Greenwich the <i>Philip Laing</i>, under the
command of Captain Andrew Elles, which, with the <i>John
Wickliff</i>, appointed to sail from London, had been chartered to
convey the first emigrants to Otago. These vessels left their
respective ports on Nov. 27th, 1847. The <i>John Wickliff</i>
reached Port Chalmers on March 23rd, 1848, and the <i>Philip
Laing</i> on April 15th following. The day after the arrival of the
<i>Philip Laing</i> being the Sabbath, the passengers on both ships
assembled on board the <i>Philip Laing</i> for Divine service,
which was conducted by Mr. Burns. On the following Sabbath Divine
service was held in Dunedin, when Mr. Burns preached. From that
time to February 1854 Mr. Burns continued alone to minister to the
religious needs of the settlers, the majority of whom had located
themselves in Dunedin and neighbourhood, while some had settled at
Port Chalmers, and others had taken up land in the Taieri,
Tokomairiro, and Clutha districts, all of whom were periodically
visited by Mr. Burns. From his ministerial visits southwards Mr.
Burns was relieved by the arrival, in February 1854, of the Rev.
William Will and the Rev. William Bannerman, with whom he took part
in constituting the Presbytery of Otago in June following, and of
which he was the first Moderator. Further relief was given him by
the settlement of Rev. William Johnstone, at Port Chalmers, in June
1858, and by the subdivision of the Free Church, Dunedin, by the
formation of Knox Church, under the pastorate of the Rev. D. M.
Stuart, in 1860. In 1861 Mr. Burns received the diploma of Doctor
of Divinity from the University of Edinburgh. In 1866, on the
formation of the synod as the Supreme Court of the Church, rendered
necessary by the increase of ministers throughout Otago and
Southland, and the formation of several presbyteries, Dr. Burns
presided as first Moderator. Advancing years and failing health led
to the appointment of a colleague and successor in the person of
the Rev. George Sutherland in 1868. Towards the close of 1870 Dr.
Burns retired wholly from public duties, and died on Jan. 23rd,
1871. A monument to his memory has been erected in Dunedin, not far
from the spot where one of his illustrious uncle has stood for some
years past. Whilst Captain Cargill was the lay organiser and ruler
of the Otago settlement, the late Dr. Burns was its spiritual guide
and adviser. It was in 1844 that the New Zealand Company,
perceiving the wonderful life which animated the free Church,
approached her with a view to found a Free Church colony in New
Zealand. The offer was entertained, and the Laymen's Association
for planting the colony of Otago was organised, with Dr. Alcorn for
its secretary in Glasgow and Mr. John McGlashan for its secretary
in Edinburgh. The Association, with the utmost unanimity, fixed on
Captain Cargill to be the Moses and Dr. Burns to be the Aaron of
the enterprise, as Dr. Stuart phrased it. It is well known that Sir
William Chambers was one of those who directed attention to Dr.
Burns as in all respects suitable for the office of pioneer
minister. The doctor devoted much time to the advocacy of the
scheme, and in his speeches he gave prominence to its
objects&mdash;the settlement of the people on their own acres and
the planting of church and school within their reach.</p>

Australia. He was called to the Colonial bar in May 1870, and
became senior partner in the firm of Stone &amp; Burt. He was
nominated a member of the Legislative Council in 1874, but
resigned, and was afterwards an elected member, retaining his seat
until the dissolution of that body in 1890. At the special request
of the Governor Mr. Burt acted as Attorney-General, with a seat in
the Executive Council, for six months in 1886, after the retirement
of Mr. Hensman, his private practice rendering it impossible for
him to hold the position longer. In the same year he was a member
of the Western Australian Commission for the Colonial and Indian
Exhibition of 1886, and was appointed one of the representatives of
Western Australia at the Colonial Conference held in London in
1887. In the same year he was made Q.C. Mr. Burt is Consular Agent
for Portugal and Vice-Consul for Denmark. He revisited England in
1890. Mr. Burt married, in July 1872, Juila, daughter of Gustavus

afterwards Government Resident of Albany, Western Australia, by
Anne Wright his wife. Mr. Hare was a half-brother of the well-known
Archdeacon (Julius Charles) Hare, of Hurstmonceux. In Dec. 1890 Mr.
Burt accepted a seat in the Forrest Ministry, and was appointed
first Attorney-General of Western Australia under responsible
government, being returned for Ashburton to the Legislative
Assembly. In 1891 he visited London in the capacity of first acting

Daventry Grammar School. He entered the navy in 1807, taking part
in the attack on New Orleans in 1814. In Nov. 1819 he entered at
the Inner Temple, and was called to the bar in Nov. 1824. Having
practised with success, he was Recorder of Daventry from 1826 to
1827, and Puisne Judge the Cape of Good Hope from 1828 to 1832,
when he was appointed to a similar post in New South Wales, which
he held until 1844, when he was transferred to Madras, where he
remained till 1857, when he retired from the bench and returned to
Sydney. He was nominated to the Legislative Council of New South
Wales, and was President of that body from Feb. 1858 to May 1861,
when just prior to the expiry of the function of the House by
effluxion of time, resigned, with nineteen other members, on the
attempt of the Cowper Ministry to carry the Robertson Land Bills
through the House by the nomination of twenty-one new members,
favourably disposed to the policy of the Government. When the
Council was reconstituted under the instructions of the Home
Government in that year, Sir William Burton was not again offered a
seat, Mr. Wentworth succeeding him in the presidential chair.
Consequent thereupon Sir William decided to quit the colony and
return to England, where he died in Aug. 1888. Sir William was
knighted by patent in Nov. 1844. He married, first, on April 5th,
1827, Margaret, daughter of Leny Smith, of Homerton, who died in
Sept. 1846; and secondly, on June 11th, 1849, Maria Alphonsine,
daughter of John Beatty West, M.P. for Dublin, who survived him.
Sir William was the author of a brochure, entitled "The State of
Religion and Education in New South Wales," in which he drew a
terrible picture of the state of the convict establishment at
Norfolk Island in the year 1834, when he visited it as a judge to
try a contingent of mutineers, of whom thirteen were subsequently
hanged, though Judge Burton mercifully postponed the executions
until he could consult with Sir Richard Bourke, in Sydney, secure
that, at any rate, they should be provided with the consolations of
religion before being launched into eternity. The pamphlet called
forth a reply from Bishop Ullathorne.</p>

<p><a name="A213" id="A213"></a><b>Buzacott, Charles Hardie</b>,
was born at Torrington, Devonshire, in 1835, and arrived at Sydney,
N.S.W., in 1852, where, desiring to become a journalist, he
acquired the art of letter press printing. In 1860 he went to
Queensland, where he established the <i>Maryborough Chronicle</i>,
and about two years later moved northward to Rockhampton. In 1884
he started the <i>Peak Downs Telegram</i>, at Clermont, where he
lived until the great flood of 1870, when he narrowly escaped with
his life by climbing a tree at midnight, as the surging waters
broke into his printing office, and carried away much of his plant.
Disheartened with his prospects after this occurrence, he sold his
business for a nominal sum, intending to remove with his family to
New Zealand; but in passing through Rockhampton he was induced to
buy the <i>Bulletin</i> for his brother, and was obliged to remain
for the time being to carry it on. He soon converted the paper into
a morning daily, and published the weekly <i>Capricornian</i>. In
1873 he was returned to the Legislative Assembly as member for
Rockhampton, and held that position for more than four years, when
the pressure of private and public business compelled his
resignation. In 1878, his health being unsatisfactory, he removed
to Brisbane, where he continued to write for his journals at
Rockhampton, and also contributed to the leading columns of the
<i>Brisbane Courier</i>. In Jan. 1879 he was induced by Sir Thomas
McIlwraith to accept the Postmaster-Generalship, with a seat in the
Legislative Council. This position he occupied till Dec 1880. Mr.
Buzacott was the author of some of the principal measures
introduced by the first McIlwraith Ministry, among others the
Divisional Boards Act of 1879, the Local Works Loans Act of 1880,
the Postal Card and Note Act and the General Tramways Act of 1882.
As Postmaster-General he united the distinct Post and Telegraph
departments into one, thus saving much expense, introduced the
telephone into the colony, and induced the Cabinet to call for
tenders for the Torres Straits mail service by steamers running
between Brisbane and London&mdash;a project enthusiastically

then on a visit to the mother country. In Dec. 1880, in consequence
of the death of his eldest brother, Mr. Buzacott was compelled to
retire from public life, and devote his attention to business. He
accepted the management of the Brisbane Newspaper Company, in which
he acquired one-third interest. Under his auspices the
<i>Courier</i> was doubled in size, the <i>Queenslander</i>
enlarged, and the <i>Evening Observer</i> purchased and carried on

friends, he sought election to the Legislative Assembly as member
for Oxley, but was defeated, and has not since sought to re-enter
public life. He is editor, as well as part proprietor, of the

<p><a name="A218" id="A218"></a><b>Cadell, Francis</b>, the
principal explorer of the river Murray, was the son of Hugh Francis
Cadell, of Cockenzie, near Preston Pans, Haddingtonshire, and was
born in 1822, and educated at Edinburgh and in Germany. He entered
as a midshipman on board an East Indiaman, and took part in the
first Chinese war, being present at the siege of Canton and the
capture of Amoy and Ningpo. At twenty-two he was in command of a
vessel, and meanwhile visited the shipbuilding yards of the Tyne
and Clyde, gaining a thorough knowledge of naval architecture and
the construction of steam engines. He studied the subject of river
navigation after a visit to the Amazon; and in 1848, when he
arrived in Australia, his attention was drawn to the practicability
of navigating the Murray and its tributaries, which had till then
only served for watering flocks. Encouraged by the Governor of
South Australia (Sir H. F. Young), he put his project into
execution. He embarked in a small boat at Swanhill on the Upper
Murray, and descended the stream to Lake Victoria at its mouth, a
distance of 1300 miles. Having thus proved that the Murray was
navigable, he succeeded in crossing the dangerous bar at its mouth
in a steamer planned and constructed under his supervision, for the
Murray Steam Navigation Company, of which he was the main promoter.
This vessel accomplished 1500 miles on her first voyage from
Adelaide in 1853, when Captain Cadell had on board Sir H. F. Young
and Lady Young and a large party of ladies and gentlemen. Other
steamers were procured, and the Murrumbidgee, the Edward, and the
Darling rivers in like manner opened to traffic in 1858. Captain
Cadell, although he was preceded by Mr. Randell in the navigation
of the Murray in a small steamer, was awarded the bonus of £4000
offered by the Government for opening up that river to the junction
with the Darling to vessels of 40-horse power and not more than 2
feet draught. He was the object of several valuable presentations,
and a gold medal was struck in his honour by order of the South
Australian authorities. His subsequent career was chequered and
adventurous, and his end tragic and mysterious. The Murray Steam
Navigation Company collapsed, and ruined others as well as Captain
Cadell. He then engaged in the transport service in the New Zealand
war, and, later on, failed in an attempt to establish stores at
various depots along the Murray. A like fate attended him in a
pastoral venture to the north of Lake Victoria. He was not more
successful when he resorted to pearl-fishing on the north-east and
north-west coasts of Australia. Ultimately Captain Cadell, who
discovered the mouth of the Roper River in 1867, was murdered by
his native crew whilst on a voyage from Amboyna to the Kei islands
in June 1879. General Robert Cadell, C.B., younger brother of the
late Captain Cadell, now owns the family property at Cockenzie, and
another brother (Colonel Cadell, V.C.) is Governor of the Andaman
Islands, where the late Earl of Mayo was murdered.</p>

the Free Church, and was employed in important parochial work until
1853, when he accepted a commission from the Colonial Committee of
the Free Church to proceed to Melbourne, where he arrived in
September of that year. There, amidst the excitement of the gold
fever, he laid the foundations of Presbyterianism in Victoria,
acting as pastor of the Chalmers Church Congregation till 1865,

educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Having abandoned
his intention of entering the army, he emigrated to Tasmania, and
in 1829 obtained a Government appointment as Assistant Surveyor.
For many years he did good service as a surveyor and explorer, and
no man had a larger knowledge of Tasmania. In 1841 he was appointed
to accompany Sir John and Lady Franklin on their memorable overland
journey through the forest to Macquarie Harbour. He served under
Surveyors-General Frankland, Power, and Sprent; and in 1859 was
himself promoted to be Surveyor-General of the colony in succession
to the last-named gentleman. In 1870 Mr. Calder retired on a
pension, and shortly afterwards was appointed Sergeant-at-Arms to
the House of Assembly, an office which he held until his death. Mr.
Calder contributed many valuable articles to the press on the early
history of Tasmania. His papers on the aborigines, containing a
large mass of original information on their habits and history,
were republished under the title of "The Wars, Extirpation, Habits,
etc., of the Native Tribes of Tasmania" (Hobart, 1875). He also
wrote "Boat Expeditions around Tasmania, 1815 and 1824" (Hobart,
1881); "Oyster Culture"; "Tasmanian Industries" (1869); "The
Woodlands of Tasmania" (London Royal Colonial Institute, 1874). At
the time of his death he was preparing a work on "The Pitcairners

daughter of the late James Atkinson, and was born at Oldbury, near
Berrima, N.S.W., on Feb. 25th, 1834. Her mother had in early life
written some successful books for children; and when very young
Miss Atkinson wrote for the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> a series
of papers called "A Voice from the Country," which attracted
considerable notice at the time. Miss Atkinson also wrote
"Gertrude" (1857), "Cowanda" (1859), "Tom Hillicker," and other
Australian tales, illustrated by herself. Besides productions
published in the <i>Sydney Mail</i>, she was the author of some
Kurrajong sketches which appeared in the <i>Town and Country
Journal</i>. During her residence at Kurrajong she collected
valuable specimens of native plants for Baron F. von Müller, many
of which are recorded in "Flora Australiensis" and the "Fragmenta
Phytographia Australiæ" The genus <i>Atkinsonia</i> was established
in her honour, and the species <i>Epacris Calvertiana</i> was named
to indicate her exertions at a later period. In 1870 she married
Mr. James Snowden Calvert, who accompanied Dr. Leichardt in his
exploring expedition to Port Essington in 1843-5. She died suddenly
on April 28th, 1872. Mr. Calvert died in July 1874.</p>

<p><a name="A225" id="A225"></a><b>Calvert, Rev. James</b>, the
well-known Methodist Missionary, was a native of Pickering, in the
North Riding of Yorkshire. He was sent out in 1838, in company with
John Hunt, to labour amongst the cannibals in Fiji, where he
remained for eighteen years, during which time he witnessed
marvellous triumphs of Christianity. In his labours among the
Fijians he was ably assisted by his heroic wife, Mary Fowler
Calvert, who was in every way a model missionary's wife, and much
of the wonderful success of those years was due to her patient,
self-denying labours. By Mr. Calvert's ministry the Fijian King
Thakombau was converted to Christianity, renounced polygamy, and
for many years after lived a consistent life. His last act as a
king was to cede Fiji to Great Britain. In 1856 Mr. Calvert
returned to England, and during his stay in the country
superintended the printing of the entire Scriptures in the Fijian
language. In 1872 he was sent out by the Wesleyan Missionary
Society to South Africa. He died at Hastings in 1892 at the
advanced age of seventy-nine.</p>

<p><a name="A227" id="A227"></a><b>Cameron, General Sir Duncan
Alexander</b>, G.C.B., son of the late Lieut.-General Sir John
Cameron, K.C.B., was born in 1808, and entered the army in 1825,
becoming captain in 1833, major in 1839, and colonel in 1854. At
the Battle of the Alma, in the Crimean war, he commanded the 42nd
Regiment, or Black Watch, and the Highland Brigade at Balaclava, at
Kertch, and at Sebastopol. At the assault on the outworks, on June
18th, 1854, he was also in command, and for his services received a
medal with three clasps, besides being made a C.B. and an officer
of the Legion of Honour, and receiving the Sardinian and Turkish
medal (third class) of the Medjidieh. In 1859 he was made
major-general. In 1863 he was despatched to New Zealand to succeed
General Pratt in charge of the twelve regiments in that colony at
the time of the Maori war, being granted the rank of
lieut.-general. Up to this moment there had been no absolute
declaration of war between the Waikatos and the colonists; but on
July 12th in that year, General Cameron crossed the Maungatawhiri
with 380 men, and this was practically the beginning of the Waikato
war. He it was who conducted the assaults upon Mere-Mere,
Rangiriri, Rangiaohia, and the Gate Pa; and effectually brought to
a conclusion the northern war. In Jan. 1864, General Cameron went
to Wanganui, whither the war had extended. This was the occasion of
an unfortunate quarrel between the Governor (Sir George Grey) and
himself. General Cameron with 1100 men refused to attack a
<i>pa</i> called Wereroa, the capture of which the Governor
considered indispensable to a successful campaign, and alleged that
his force was insufficient. In the issue the colonial forces, under
Sir George himself, in conjunction with the friendly Maoris,
attacked and took the <i>pa</i>; but the incident led, in Feb.
1864, to the retirement of the General, who went to England and
laid his complaints before the War Office. His charge against the
Governor was that he had encouraged subversion of discipline, and
consequently confusion and disorder. Lord de Grey at the War Office
espoused the cause of General Cameron, and Sir George Grey was
somewhat curtly snubbed by the Colonial Office for his
officiousness in taking the field. In 1864 General Cameron was
created K.C.B., and in 1873 G.C.B. In 1868 he was promoted to the
rank of lieut.-general, and in 1875 to that of general. From 1868
to 1875 he was Governor of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst,
and was some time Vice-President of the Council of Army Education,
and Hon. Colonel 1st Battalion Royal Highlanders. General Cameron
married, in 1873, Flora, fourth daughter of Andrew Maclean, M.D.,
Deputy Inspector-General of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst,
who died in 1875. General Cameron died on June 8th, 1886.</p>

Witchingham Hall, Norfolk. Lord Canterbury was Under Secretary for
the Home Department from 1841 to 1846, Lieut.-Governor of New
Brunswick from 1854 to 1861, and Governor of Trinidad from Sept.
1864 to April 1866, when he was appointed to succeed Sir Charles
Darling as Governor of Victoria. He assumed office in August 1866,
under circumstances of unusual difficulty. His predecessor's
concurrence in the measures taken by the McCulloch Ministry to
establish the absolute supremacy of the Legislative Assembly in
matters of finance, had endeared him to the people as much as it
embroiled him with the imperial authorities. Coming as the
representative of the latter, Lord Canterbury's action was certain
to be subjected to severe scrutiny; and it is to his credit that,
whilst he loyally adhered to his instructions, and was thus placed
in opposition to the popular wishes in a period of extreme
excitement, he managed to emerge from the crisis to the
satisfaction of the Home authorities, and without incurring any
marked odium in the colony over which he presided as the
representative of the Queen. The Duke of Edinburgh visited Victoria
during his term of office, and for the nonce party strife was

<p><a name="A234" id="A234"></a><b>Cape, William Timothy</b>, was
the eldest son of William Cape, of Ireby, in Cumberland, and was
born at Walworth, in Surrey, on Oct. 25th, 1806. He was educated at
Merchant Taylors' School, and proceeded to Sydney with his father
in 1821. Here he assisted the latter in opening the Sydney Academy.
The elder Mr. Cape was afterwards appointed by the Government
master of the Sydney Public School in Castlereagh Street, and here
Mr. W. T. Cape acted as an assistant master, becoming head-master
on the resignation of his father. In this position he remained
until July 1829, and in 1830 opened a private school in King
Street, Sydney. About this time the idea of establishing Sydney
College was mooted; and in 1835, as the result of overtures from
the committee of this college, Mr. Cape transferred his private
pupils to that institution and was appointed head-master. In 1842
he resigned this post, and again opened a private school, on the
Glemore Road, Paddington. In 1856 he finally retired from
scholastic work, having during his long career conducted the
education of some of the leading publicists of Sydney. In 1859 he
was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Wollombi, and did good
service in the cause of education. He was also one of the
Commissioners of National Education, a Magistrate, and a Fellow of
St. Paul's College within the University of Sydney. He died in
London on June 14th, 1863, of small-pox.</p>

Jackson</b>, C.B., eldest son of Thomas Carey, of Rozel, Guernsey,
by his second wife, Barbara, daughter of Colonel Jackson, M.P., was
born in 1828, and entered the army in 1845. Having served with
distinction in the Cape Mounted Rifles, of which he became major,
he was military secretary to Sir James Jackson, when commanding the
forces at the Cape, and was ultimately colonel of the 18th Irish.
He was Acting Governor of the Isle of Wight in 1862, and served in
New Zealand as colonel on the staff and brigadier-general from
August 1863 to August 1865. He distinguished himself at the taking
of Orakau (one of the few real successes of the war) in 1864, and
in recognition of his services was made C.B. in 1865. Subsequently
the Maori "king-maker," Te Waharoa, made his submission to him.
Having been appointed to the command of the forces in Australia, he
took up his residence in Melbourne, and on the departure of Sir
Charles Darling was Acting Governor of Victoria, administering the
government from May to August 1866. He returned to England in 1867,
and was promoted to the command of the 2nd Brigade at Aldershot. In
1871 he was appointed to command the Northern District, and became
major-general. He died at Manchester on Jane 12th, 1872. General
Carey married in Feb. 1861 Hester Olivia, only daughter of William
Gordon Thompson, of Clifton Gardens, Hyde Park, London.</p>

the founder of the Otago settlement, New Zealand, was born in
August 1784, and entered the army, becoming captain in the 74th
Highlanders. The General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland,
having had its attention directed to the openings for colonisation
in the province of Otago, New Zealand, an Otago Association was
formed at Glasgow in May 1845, to found a special settlement for
Scotchmen. Four hundred thousand acres of land were purchased for
the purpose from the New Zealand Company, and in Nov. 1847 Captain
Cargill, who had been one of the main promoters of the project,
sailed in the John Wickliff as the leader of the new pilgrims,
pitching his tent in March 1848 on the territory acquired. From
this time forth Captain Cargill was virtually ruler of the new
settlement until the New Zealand Constitution Act was passed, when
he was elected first Superintendent of Otago, and was re-elected in
1856. He was returned to the first House of Representatives of New
Zealand as member for Dunedin in 1854. Captain Cargill died in
Dunedin on August 6th, 1860, just prior to the arrival of the
notification that he had been created C.B. His eldest son, Mr. Wm.
Walter Cargill, was member for Berwick in the House of Commons from
1863 to 1865, and was one of the founders and a director of the
Oriental Bank Corporation. He was also Chairman of the Board of
Directors of the New Oriental Bank Corporation.</p>

<p><a name="A240" id="A240"></a><b>Carrington, Right Hon. Charles
Robert</b>, Baron, G.C.M.G., F.R.S., sometime Governor of New South
Wales, is the eldest son of the second Lord Carrington, by his
second wife, Augusta Annabella, younger daughter of Peter Robert,
Lord Willoughby de Eresby, joint Hereditary Lord Great Chamberlain
of England. Lord Carrington was born on May 16th, 1843, and
entering the army, ultimately became Captain in the Royal Horse
Guards. He was member for Wycombe in the House of Commons from 1865
to 1868, when he succeeded his father in the peerage. From 1881 to
1885 he was Captain of the Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms, and in right
of his mother is joint Hereditary Lord Great Chamberlain of
England. It was in 1885 that Lord Carrington, who had previously
mainly had a reputation as a man of society and pleasure, first
came forward in a prominent capacity as a serious publicist. The
Australian Colonies had long been dissatisfied with the official,
or "effete aristocratic," type of Governors, and had been demanding
that future viceroys should be men of a class not deemed unworthy
of the higher prizes of English political life. There were
difficulties in the way of a literal compliance with the wish thus
expressed; but as a sort of compromise, it was decided to go
outside the official class, and to appoint for the future as
colonial viceroys men of superior wealth and social status, the
position being, in fact, as the Imperial authorities wisely
recognised, mainly a social one. Lord Carrington was the Governor
selected to inaugurate the new <i>régime</i>, and rendered it a
striking success, his term of office as Governor of New South Wales
from 1885 to 1890 giving high satisfaction to the Colonists, and
constituting him, to quote Lord Onslow, the late Governor of New
Zealand, probably "the most popular Governor who ever went to
Australia." Even in the political arena Lord Carrington was able to
exercise much quiet influence, and in his social duties, which he
performed with unfailing tact, he was greatly aided by his wife,
the daughter of the fifth Lord Suffield, to whom he was married in
July 1878. The departure of Lord and Lady Carrington from New South
Wales was marked by expressions of regret and esteem, quite without
previous parallel in Australian history. Since his return to
England Lord Carrington has taken an active part in English
politics as a supporter of Mr. Gladstone's Home Rule policy, and
has embraced numerous opportunities of placing his views on
Colonial and Imperial topics before the public. He does not look
with hope to a formal federation, but believes that the ties of
kinship which now bind the Mother country and the Colonies might be
indefinitely strengthened by sympathetic action on the part of the
former. To the Liberal party he looks as the best exemplars of the
imperialism of the future, and the speeches in which he has
attacked what in some quarters is regarded as the vested monopoly
of the Tory party in an enlightened colonial policy, have excited
considerable attention both in England and the Colonies. At the
elections in 1892 Lord Carrington was returned to the London County
Council as a member of the "progressive" party.</p>

<p><a name="A241" id="A241"></a><b>Carrington, Francis Thomas
Dean</b>, was born in London on Nov. 17th, 1843, and educated at
the City of London School. He received his first lesson in drawing
from George Cruickshank, and went through the South Kensington
course. He commenced drawing for Clarke &amp; Co., Paternoster Row,
a title-page to one of Captain Mayne Reid's novels being his first
appearance in print. Mr. Carrington came to Australia, and after
some experience on the diggings at Wood's Point, Jericho, Jordan,
and Crooked River, he joined <i>Melbourne Punch</i> in 1866,
succeeding N. Chevalier and O. R. Campbell. With this paper he was
connected for twenty-one years, drawing the principal cartoons and
many smaller blocks all through the stirring times of the Darling
excitement and the "Berry blight." Mr. Carrington left <i>Punch</i>
when it was amalgamated with the <i>Bulletin</i> and joined the
Melbourne <i>Australasian</i>.</p>

<p><a name="A242" id="A242"></a><b>Carrington, Frederic Alonzo</b>,
the "father of the settlement" of Taranaki, N.Z., as he is
generally called, when a young man entered the Ordnance Survey
Department of England, being appointed in Jan. 1826 by the Duke of
Wellington. Showing ability for topographical delineation and
survey work, he soon attracted the attention of the eminent
engineers of the day, and when the Reform Bill was passed in 1832,
he was selected by the Parliamentary Commissioners to describe the
boundaries of the boroughs in the districts from Bristol to
Manchester. For his services on that occasion he received the
special thanks of the Commissioners. Subsequently he was selected
by the Plymouth Company as its chief surveyor to go to New Zealand
to choose a site for the settlement the company proposed forming
there. On Feb. 12th, 1841, Mr. F. A. Carrington and family,
together with his brother, Mr. Octavius Carrington (who was his
chief assistant), and the survey party, arrived off Taranaki. With
great labour lines were cut through the dense vegetation, and a
spot cleared; and after much difficulty the site for the town of
New Plymouth was laid out and surveyed under Mr. F. A. Carrington's
directions. In Sept. 1843 Mr. Carrington returned to England, and
on his arrival in London he found that the directors of the New
Zealand Company (which had absorbed the Plymouth Company) were
thinking of ceasing their functions for a time, and accordingly Mr.
Carrington retired from their service, receiving a very
complimentary testimonial from the directors. Mr. Carrington was
engaged in connection with railways during the time he was in
England (1844-51), but he gave a good deal of thought and attention
to New Zealand matters, and tried to make Taranaki better known to
the British public. Mr. Carrington took with him to England a
quantity of the Taranaki ironsand, and after having a very careful
analysis made of some of it he had a bar of iron cast. He then
entered into a lengthy correspondence with the Colonial Office,
endeavouring to obtain a grant of the beach on the Taranaki shore,
which resulted in a refusal, though Lord Grey offered to give Mr.
Carrington a letter to the Governor of New Zealand, which on his
arrival there would ensure a grant of the beach being given to him,
provided it had not been leased to any one before. As it would have
taken too long in those days to have visited New Zealand and return
home again with the desired information, the matter was for the
time abandoned; but Mr. Carrington exhibited the bar of iron and
some of the Taranaki ironsand at the Exhibition of 1851, when he
called the attention of the Master-General of the Ordnance
Department (Sir H. de la Beche) to it. After visiting California
three different times from London, in connection with mines,
water-races, railways, etc., Mr. Carrington again returned to New
Zealand, having been absent nearly fourteen years, his object being
the utilisation of the ironsand and other matters in connection
with the district; and being backed by men of capital and standing,
who took great interest in the colony, hoped to start the iron
industry in Taranaki. The North Island was in a very unsettled
state at the time owing to the natives showing an antagonistic
attitude towards the Europeans, which in 1860 ended in hostilities
which lasted for ten years. In 1862 Mr. Carrington was appointed
Government Engineering Surveyor for Taranaki, and in that capacity
carried out in connection with the military authorities the road
construction necessary in the district. On peace being restored Mr.
Carrington turned his attention to local matters, and consenting to
be nominated as Superintendent of the province of Taranaki in 1869,
he was returned by the electors, and held that position till the
provinces were abolished in 1876. He was also elected to a seat in
the House of Representatives, and held the position for several
years. He retired from politics in 1880. Seeing the necessity there
was for harbour accommodation at New Plymouth, Mr. Carrington for
years agitated in the hope of getting protective works built that
shipping might visit the port in safety. It was chiefly through his
exertions that a fourth of the land revenue of the district was set
aside for harbour purposes and a Harbour Board created, which
raised the money to carry out the work. On Feb. 7th, 1881, Mr. F.
A. Carrington laid the first stone of the present structure, thus
crowning his labours as the founder of the settlement of
Taranaki.</p>

March 1868, married firstly at Auckland in April 1871 Miss Augusta
C. Wilkins, and secondly at Christchurch, in that colony, on August

superintendent at Christchurch, stores manager of the Middle Island
Railways in June 1878, and stores manager of the New Zealand

<p><a name="A245" id="A245"></a><b>Casey, Hon. James Joseph</b>,
C.M.G., County Court Judge and Land Tax Commissioner Victoria, is
the son of the late James Casey, of Tromroe, co. Clare, Ireland,
and was born there on Dec. 25th, 1831. He was educated at Galway
College, and after five years spent in America he arrived in
Victoria in 1855, where he joined the late Mr. Angus Mackay in the
purchase of the <i>Bendigo Advertiser</i>, and afterwards started
the <i>McIvor Times</i> and <i>Riverine Herald</i>. In 1861 he was
elected to the Assembly for Sandhurst, but was unseated on
petition. Two years later he was returned for Normanby in the
Liberal interest, and continued to sit for that constituency until
1880. In Sept. 1865 he was called to the Victorian bar, and
practised with success, being from time to time Crown Prosecutor.
From July 1868 to Sept. 1869 he was Minister of Justice in the
second McCulloch Administration, exchanging this office for that of
Solicitor-General about a fortnight before the defeat of the
Government. The next year Mr. Casey was appointed Chairman of a
Royal Commission on Intercolonial Legislation and a Court of
Appeal. In June 1872 he became Minister of Lands and Minister of
Agriculture under Mr. Francis, and held office till August
1875&mdash;for the last twelve months of the time under Mr.
Kerford, who succeeded Mr. Francis as Premier. Whilst at the head
of the Lands Office Mr. Casey reorganised the department, and
constituted the survey branch on an effective basis. He also
checked the system of "dummyism" by instituting inquiries, and
subsequently forfeiting the runs and improvements of the
incriminated squatters. In 1878 he was appointed Executive
Commissioner for Victoria at the Paris Exhibition, and was created
C.M.G. for his services, being also nominated an Officer of the
Legion of Honour by the French Government. The Victorian Hansard
was established on his motion, and, when in office, he introduced
the system of appointing magistrates to districts instead of for
the whole colony. The jurisdiction of the County Courts was, on his
initiation, increased from £50 to £250 at common law, and an
equitable jurisdiction was conferred on them up to £500. Though
still claiming to be a Liberal, Mr. Casey assumed an independent
attitude towards the second Berry Ministry from 1877 to 1880, and
was in consequence ejected from his seat at Mandurang at the
general election in the latter year. He did not re-enter
parliament, though he unsuccessfully contested Sandridge (now Port
Melbourne) in 1883. Mr. Casey, who was the first President of the
Federal Bank of Australia, was Executive Vice-President of the
Melbourne International Exhibition of 1880, and in that capacity,
and as Chairman of the Great Britain Committee, contributed much to
its success. In April 1884 Mr. Casey, who is the author of "Casey's
Justices' Manual," was appointed a County Court Judge; and in July
1885 he assumed the additional functions of a Land Tax
Commissioner, being for a short time in that year an Acting Judge
of the Supreme Court. Mr. Casey married Mary Teresa, daughter of
John Cahill and Mary McNamara his wife.</p>

finally settled there in 1862, when he purchased three thousand
acres of land in the parish of Yering, and commenced planting the
now famous St. Hubert vineyard. About 1875 he formed a limited
company, under which the vineyard was carried on until 1879, when
Mr. A. Rowan joined him as partner in the present firm of De

vineyard in Victoria, Mr. Castella in 1859 imported plant necessary
for the cellar and ten thousand vines, half of which were Sauvignon
and two thousand La Folle (the grape used for making the best
Cognac), the latter of which were all failures. The produce of the

<p><a name="A248" id="A248"></a><b>Catt, Hon. Alfred</b>, M.P.,
J.P., Chairman of Committees of the Legislative Assembly of South
Australia, was born in 1838 at Newington, in Kent. He arrived in
South Australia in 1847, and for ten years engaged in agricultural
pursuits at Balhannah and Strathalbyn. After a short trial of the
Victorian diggings he returned to Strathalbyn, and entered into
business. Subsequently he opened a store at the then youthful town
of Gladstone, and was elected to the Assembly for the district of
Stanley, April 27th, 1881. Three years later, when the constituency
was reconstructed, he was returned for Gladstone, which he still
represents. Mr. Catt accepted the post of Commissioner of Crown
Lands in Mr. (now Sir) John Bray's first administration, on June
24th, 1881, and held it till April 23rd, 1884, under circumstances
of special difficulty. Disasters had fallen thickly upon the
farmers of the colony, especially in the northern districts lying
beyond Goyder's line of rainfall, where thirsty and often heavily
timbered country had been taken up at extravagant prices by the
competing agriculturists, who in some cases had offered as much as
£6 6<i>s</i>. per acre. The attempt to grow wheat in these parts
proved that the selectors could not pay the stipulated price, and
the Government of the day came to the rescue with a proposal that
the farmers should be allowed to surrender their land and compete
for it again. The result was that they got their land back at about
£1 0<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., thus entailing upon the State a nominal
loss of about half a million. The surrender clauses were admittedly
difficult to administer, and Mr. Catt was much blamed at the time
for allowing farmers holding excellent land in the lower north and
south-east to come under these clauses. Mr. Catt, however, claimed
that these were exceptional cases. On the fall of the Downer
Ministry in 1887, Mr. Catt accepted the portfolio of Commissioner
of Public Works under Mr. Playford, and held it from June 11th,
1887, to June 27th, 1889. At the commencement of the session of
1890 Mr. Catt was unanimously elected to the Chairmanship of
Committees of the Legislative Assembly. In 1887 he received the
royal permission to bear the title of "Honourable" within the

irrigation of half a million acres of land on the banks of the
Murray River. The Messrs. Chaffey are natives of Ontario, Canada,
and for a number of years carried on irrigation enterprises with
success in Southern California, forming settlements, of which the
best known are those at Riverside, Etiwanda, and at Ontario in the
San Bernardino County, where they established an agricultural
college, endowing it with land valued at £20,000. In 1886 the
brothers came to Australia, and secured from the governments of
Victoria and South Australia the sites for two irrigation colonies
on the banks of the Murray, the combined area totalling 500,000
acres. These settlements are situate at Mildura, in Victoria, and
Renmark, 140 miles lower down the river, in South Australia, the
former, being the first transferred to them, having made the most
headway. The Mildura settlement consists of 250,000 acres, of which
50,000 acres are, in the first instance, being practically dealt
with, this area including the site of a town and surrounding
residential or suburban villa blocks. A company has been floated to
provide the needful capital, and a most satisfactory and superior
class of settlers has been attracted. The cultivation intended to
be carried on is that of the grape, orange, olive, prune, and any
other fruits or vegetables found suitable. The establishment of an
agricultural college, similar to that at Ontario, is also provided
for in the contracts with the governments, the stipulation having
been inserted at the suggestion of the firm.</p>

studied for the ministry at Cheshunt College, near London. He left
Great Britain as a missionary for Rarotonga, Hervey Group, on Jan.
4th, 1866, in connection with the London Missionary Society, on

wrecked on the way and lost everything. He spent ten years in
Rarotonga at the head of an educational establishment, but at the
request of the directors of the London Missionary Society left the
island in 1877, and joined the New Guinea Mission. During the years
that followed Mr. Chalmers explored and opened up many miles of
coast line and inland for the purpose of establishing mission
stations, and assisted in the proclaiming of the protectorate over
British New Guinea. Mr. Chalmers visited the north-east coast of
New Guinea three times, and made several important discoveries. In

1870 to 1878, and of St Paul's, Geelong, from the latter year (when
he was also appointed Canon of Melbourne) till May 1892, when he
was elected to succeed the late Dr. Thomas as Bishop of
Goulburn.</p>

<p><a name="A254" id="A254"></a><b>Chambers, Charles Haddon</b>,
the well-known dramatist, was born at Stanmore, Sydney, N.S.W., in
1860. He traces his descent from an old west of Scotland family
which had migrated to the north of Ireland, and been incorporated
in the famous Ulster plantation. His father's maternal grandfather,
John Ritchie, was the first shipbuilder in Ireland. In the middle
of the last century, this enterprising Scotsman went over from the
Clyde, and founded the yards where the <i>White Star</i> liners are
now built. The dramatist's father, John Ritchie Chambers, was born
in Ulster. At a comparatively early age he went to Victoria, and,
subsequently drifting into New South Wales, he became attached to
the Civil Service of that colony, in which he remained, occupying
high positions in the Lands Department until he died in 1882.
Haddon Chambers himself was educated at Marrickville and Fort
Street Public schools, and in 1875 entered the local Civil Service,
but resigned after a short time and betook himself with a squatter
friend to the "back-blocks." In 1880 he visited Europe, returning
to Australia after a nine months' trip. In 1882 he reappeared in
London to begin his literary career, which he did by publishing
some stories and articles in the society journals; and subsequently
he wrote a number of short stories for the <i>Argosy</i>,
<i>Belgravia</i>, <i>Truth</i>, <i>Cassel's Saturday Journal</i>,
and other periodicals&mdash;one of which, a story of murder,
entitled "In Cold Blood," drew a leading article from the <i>Daily
News</i>. Mr. Chambers next turned his attention to the stage.
Feeling his way cautiously at first, he produced a two-act farce at
Margate in 1886. Next year a little domestic drama, <i>The Open
Gate</i>, was played with success at the Comedy Theatre, London. In
conjunction with Mr. Stanley Little, he then dramatised for Mr.
Charrington and Miss Janet Achurch, Rider Haggard's novel "Dawn,"
under the title of <i>Devil Caresfoot</i>, which was first produced
at a <i>matinée</i> at the Vaudeville Theatre, London. These
artistes have recently reproduced the piece in Australia, with
considerable success. Mr. Haddon Chambers, however, made his
<i>coup</i> by a four-act original drama, <i>Captain Swift</i>,
written for and originally produced by Mr. Beerbohm Tree, the
well-known actor-manager of the Haymarket Theatre. This proved an
immediate and genuine success, not only in London, but also in the
English provinces, in America and in Australia. Since then Mr.
Haddon Chambers has written <i>The Idler</i> As there was no
immediate prospect of the production of this play in London, he
crossed to New York, where he produced it at the Lyceum Theatre.
The play scored an immediate and conspicuous success, with the
result that, three months later, it appeared under the management
of Mr. George Alexander at the St. James' Theatre, London, where it
had a good run. <i>The Idler</i> has also been brought out with
great success in Australia, with Mr. Charles Cartwright and Miss
Olga Nethersole in the leading parts. Mr. Haddon Chambers' comedy,
<i>The Honourable Herbert</i>, was produced by Mr. Thomas Thorne,
at the Vaudeville Theatre, in 1892. Mr. Chambers republished his
admirable short story "The Pipe of Peace," which he has dramatised
for Mr. Geo. Alexander, in Mr. Patchett Martin's "Oak-Bough and
Wattle-Blossom," and also contributed to Mr. Philip Mennell's
collection "In Australian Wilds."</p>

<p><a name="A255" id="A255"></a><b>Champ, Colonel Hon. William
Thomas Napier</b>, first Premier of Tasmania, is the son of Captain
Thomas Champ and Mary Anne Blackaller, his wife. He was born at
Maldon, Essex, on April 15th, 1808, and was educated at the Royal
Military College, Sandhurst. Having obtained a commission in the
army, he arrived in Sydney with his regiment in Oct 1828. The
following year he was stationed in Tasmania, and in 1830 took part
in Governor Arthur's famous attempt to form a cordon across the
island so as to secure the hostile blacks on Tasman's Peninsula. He
afterwards retired from the army, entered the civil service in
Tasmania, and held successively the following appointments, viz.,
Assistant Police Magistrate, Chairman of the Board for
Investigating the Penal Settlement of Tasman's Peninsula, and
Comptroller-General of Convicts. In 1852, on the refusal of Mr. H.
S. Chapman, the then Colonial Secretary, to support the official
transportation policy, he was appointed to succeed him as Acting
Colonial Secretary, and on the concession of responsible government
was awarded a bonus of £6000 in lieu of a pension for loss of
office. He was elected to the first House of Assembly as member for
Launceston in 1856, and became the first Premier of the colony
under the new Constitution in November of that year, when he was
sworn of the Executive Council. He only, however, retained office
till the end of Feb. 1857, when he retired rather than assent to
the reduction of the Governor's salary. He subsequently went to
reside in Victoria, where he succeeded Captain Price, who was
murdered in 1857, as head of the Convict Department, and became a
lieut.-colonel in the local forces unattached. Colonel Champ held
the position of Inspector-General of Penal Establishments in
Victoria till Dec. 31st, 1868, when he retired on a pension, and
went to reside on his estate (since called Darra), near Meredith.
In 1871 he was chosen member, of the Victorian House of Assembly
for the East Bourke Boroughs, but his old dislike for politics
returned, and he resigned before the end of the Parliament. He was
a justice of the peace and a lieutenant-colonel in the Victorian
Military Forces, commanding for some years the North Melbourne
district, and retired finally with the rank of colonel. He was
married at New Norfolk, Tas., in March, 1837, to Helen Abigail,
daughter of Major James Gibson, formerly of the 15th Light
Dragoons.</p>

eventually settled at Hamilton, in the western district of
Victoria, where his son, the future poet, received the rudiments of
education at the State school, afterwards attending night classes
and several terms at the Hamilton Academy. Having acquired the
typographical art in the office of the <i>Hamilton Spectator</i>,
Mr. Chandler removed in 1878 to Adelaide where he joined the staff
of the <i>South Australian Register</i>, and subsequently acted for
six years as a parliamentary reporter for the <i>Advertiser</i>. In
1889 Mr. Chandler, in conjunction with Mr. H. C. Evans, started a
satirical weekly paper called <i>Quiz</i>, which enjoys a
considerable popularity in South Australia. In 1887 Mr. Chandler
published a "Bush Idyll and other Poems," and in 1889 "Songs of the

appointments at Moama, in New South Wales. Mr. Chanter has
represented the Murray electorate in the New South Wales
Legislative Assembly since 1885. In Jan. 1889 he accepted office in
the Dibbs Ministry, as Secretary for Mines, and retired with his
colleagues in the following March. He married at Campbell's Creek,
near Castlemaine, Vict., on Nov 16th, 1863, Miss Mary Ann

<p><a name="A258" id="A258"></a><b>Chapman, Hon. Henry Samuel</b>,
came of a family which had amassed wealth in commerce with the
American colonies, but became impoverished by the War of
Independence. His father was a Civil Servant in the Barrack
Department, and he was born at Kennington on July 21st, 1803, and
educated at a school at Bromley, Kent. He was a clerk in Esdaile's
Bank, and subsequently with a bill broker. In 1823 he went to
Canada, and became a merchant in Quebec, and in 1833 started <i>The
Daily Advertiser</i> in Montreal, the first daily newspaper in
Canada. He returned to England early in 1835 as the delegate of the
popular party in Canada, who instructed him to confer with Hume,
O'Connell, and Roebuck, whom he had known in Canada. Along with the
last named he took a prominent part in the agitation for securing
representative government for Canada, and was the friend of John
Stuart Mill and Richard Cobden. During his residence in England,
which lasted till 1843, he contributed many political and
economical articles to magazines and newspapers, edited the works
of Jeremy Bentham, in conjunction with Dr., afterwards Sir John,
Bowring, and wrote the articles on "Weaving" and "Wool, and its
Manufacture" for the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> in 1842. Having
acted as an assistant commissioner for inquiring into the
grievances of the handloom weavers in 1838, and having in 1840 been
called to the English bar, he joined Edward Gibbon Wakefield in his
plans for the colonisation of New Zealand. On Feb. 8th, 1840, he
started <i>The New Zealand Journal</i>, which lasted for some
years, and in 1843 he was appointed Judge of the Supreme Court of
New Zealand, and sailed for Auckland. For the following nine years
he lived in Wellington. In 1852 he was appointed to the Colonial
Secretaryship of Tasmania, but lost his office owing to his
sympathy with the Anti-transportation party. Returning to England,
he rejected an offer of a West Indian governorship, and went out in
1854 to Victoria, where he entered the Legislative Council in 1855.
On March 11th, 1857, he was appointed Attorney-General in the
O'Shanassy Government, but went out of office on April 29th in the
same year. The O'Shanassy Government came into power again on March
10th, 1858, when Mr. Chapman resumed his office, holding it till
Oct. 27th, 1859. He was also Law Lecturer at the Melbourne
University, and acted from 1862 to 1863 for Sir Redmond Barry, as
Judge of the Supreme Court. He formulated and introduced the Ballot
Bill into the Victorian Parliament, from which it has spread into
use all over the British Empire. In 1864 he was reappointed Judge
of the Supreme Court of New Zealand, and lived in Dunedin till his
death, on Dec. 27th, 1881. In 1875 he retired from the Bench, and
was subsequently Chancellor of the University of Otago. Mr. Chapman
was the author of many pamphlets and papers, including "The New
Zealand Portfolio" (1843)and "Parliamentary Government or
Responsible Ministries of the Australian Colonies" (1854). In
regard to his connection with the ballot, it may be stated that he
drafted for Mr. Nicholson in 1855 the clauses which created the
special form of the device known as the "Australian ballot," which
simply leaves the voter to strike out the names of those candidates
for whom he does <i>not</i> intend to vote. This form has been very
generally adopted in America. Mr. Chapman married first, in 1840,
Caroline, daughter of Mr. J. G. Brewer, barrister-at-law; and,
secondly, Miss Carr, a sister of the wife of Mr. R. D. Ireland
(<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><a name="A259" id="A259"></a><b>Chapman, Hon. Thomas Daniel</b>,
M.L.C., was born at Bedford, England, and came to Tasmania about
1844, becoming a leading merchant in Hobart. Entering on politics,
he was returned for the City as a member of the first semi-elective
Legislative Council which met in 1851. He became the leader of the
Liberal party; having much to do with the cessation of
transportation and the concession of responsible government, on
lines which he largely shaped, in 1850. He joined the Champ
Ministry&mdash;the first formed under the new
<i>régime</i>&mdash;and held office as Colonial Treasurer from Nov.
1st, 1856, to Feb. 26th, 1857. After four years and a half in
Opposition he himself became Premier on August 2nd, 1861. At first
he held no portfolio, but on Nov. 1st in the next year assumed that
of Colonial Treasurer. He resigned, with his colleagues, on Jan.
20th, 1863, and, after four years spent in opposition to the Whyte
Ministry, reassumed office as Colonial Treasurer, under Sir Richard
Dry, on Nov. 24th, 1866. On the reconstruction of the Ministry
under Mr. (afterwards Sir) James Milne-Wilson, on August 4th, 1869,
Mr. Chapman continued to hold the Treasurership till the retirement
of the Ministry, on Nov. 4th, 1872. His six years' tenure of the
post was the longest since responsible government was inaugurated.
Mr. Chapman left the Assembly for the Legislative Council in 1873,
when he was returned for Buckingham, a constituency which he
represented till his death. He took office for the last time on
August 4th, 1873, becoming Colonial Secretary in Mr. Kennerley's
Government, but resigned on April 1st, 1876. On July 11th, 1882, he
succeeded Mr. Innes as President of the Legislative Council, a

Entering the Government service in 1846, Mr. Chetham-Strode was
appointed Inspector of Armed Constabulary, of which body he had
command. He also received a war medal for services rendered during
encounters with natives at Horokiwi, Porirua, Wanganui, and other

occupied the position from 1860 to 1862 of Sub-Treasurer of Otago;
was Curator of Intestate Estates for some six years, and Sheriff
and Commissioner of Native Reserves. He was also the first
Returning Officer and Registration Officer after the Constitution
Act was granted to New Zealand. Elected by the trustees, he was

<p><a name="A263" id="A263"></a><b>Childers, Right Hon. Hugh
Culling Eardley</b>, M.P., F.R.S., formerly a Minister of the Crown
in Victoria, is the son of the late Rev. Eardley Childers, of
Cantley, Yorkshire, by his marriage with Maria Charlotte, eldest
daughter of Sir Culling Smith, Bart. He was born on June 25th,
1827, and educated at Cheam School and at Trinity College,
Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1850 (14th Senior Optime),
and M.A. in 1857. He married in 1850, Emily, third daughter of G.
J. A. Walker, of Norton, Worcestershire, and in the same year
emigrated to Victoria, where he was for a short time a tally clerk
on Cole's Wharf, Melbourne. Having introductions from the Colonial
Office, and being well connected, he was soon looked after by the
Government, and was appointed successively Secretary to a
Denominational School Board, a member of the National Board of
Education instituted in 1852, and subsequently Immigration Agent.
On Oct. 26th, 1852, he succeeded Mr. C. H. Ebden in the far more
important post of Auditor-General of Victoria. Under the inflation
of the gold <i>régime</i>, extravagance was universal, and the
Government had not escaped the contagion, if indeed it had not
promoted it. It is charged against Mr. Childers by the historian of
Australia, Mr. Rusden, that by his device of an imprest system he
removed the salutary checks on the extravagance of the public
service, which it was the <i>raison d'être</i> of his office to
supply. The effect was, at any rate, that unauthorised expenditure
flourished apace, with the result that within eighteen months there
was found to be a sum of £1,682,328 of unadjusted imprests, of
which £283,745 were reported by an Expert Committee to be "wholly
unaccounted for." In Dec. 1853 Mr. Childers first entered the
Administration, being appointed Collector of Customs in Victoria,
in succession to Mr. Cassells, and taking his seat in the Executive
Council (Dec. 5th). In his official capacity he conducted the bill
for the establishment of the Melbourne University through the
Legislative Council, and ultimately aided in obtaining for it in
1859 a Royal Charter. It is a curious circumstance, that in 1855 he
opposed the introduction of vote by ballot in parliamentary
elections, but probably on grounds that were in a great measure
local. After responsible government was conceded to Victoria, Mr.
Childers was returned to the first Legislative Assembly in the
district of Portland, and was a member of the first Ministry
constituted under the new autonomous conditions. Mr. Haines was
Premier, and Mr. Childers held the office of Commissioner of Trade
and Customs from Nov. 1855 to Feb. 1857, when he left Victoria, and
returned to England as the first Agent-General of the Colony in
London. He was also in the enjoyment of a colonist pension of £866
per annum, which he has drawn ever since, with the exception of the
intervals during which he has had office in England. At the present
time he has an ex-Cabinet Minister's pension in England, but the
amount of his Victorian pension is first deducted, so that the
Colonial Treasury obtains no relief. Mr. Childers' first wife died
in 1875, and he married secondly, in 1879, Katharine Ann, daughter
of the late Bishop (Gilbert) of Chichester, and widow of the Hon.
Gilbert Eliot Mr. Childers was member for Pontefract (which he
unsuccessfully contested in 1859) in the House of Commons from 1860
to 1885, when he was defeated; but in Jan. 1886 was returned for
South Edinburgh. He was a Lord of the Admiralty from April 1864 to
Aug. 1865; Secretary to the Treasury from the latter date till July
1866; First Lord of the Admiralty from Dec. 1868 to March 1871,
when the strain of work in connection with the reorganisation of
his department compelled his retirement. Mr. Childers was
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from Aug. 1872 to Oct. 1873;
Secretary of State for War from April 1880 to Dec. 1882; Chancellor
of the Exchequer from the latter date to June 1885; and Secretary
of State for the Home Department in Mr. Gladstone's short-lived
Home Rule Ministry in 1886. Throughout his political career in
England Mr. Childers has been one of Mr. Gladstone's staunchest
supporters.</p>

philanthropist, resided, in May 1810. She married, in 1830, Captain
Archibald Chisholm, of the Indian army, who being granted sick
leave, went to Sydney with his family in 1839. When compelled to
return to India he left his wife and family behind; the former
thereupon devoting herself to assisting the friendless female
immigrants who were coming to the colony in shiploads. With this
view she raised funds, opened a central depôt, and made
arrangements for the dispersion of the new arrivals in the country
districts. So great was her success that up to 1845 she had
provided homes for over 11,000 immigrants, including many men. In
that year Captain Chisholm rejoined his family, and they returned
to England in 1846; but this in no way induced Mrs. Chisholm to
abandon the good work which she bad taken in hand, and for seven
years she was actively employed in promoting suitable emigration,
founding, amongst other similar agencies, "The Family Colonisation
Loan Society," by which passage money was advanced and repaid by
weekly instalments. Meantime she lectured throughout England in
favour of emigration, improved accommodation for females being
provided by her efforts on board emigrant ships. In 1854 she
revisited Australia, and carried on her good work till 1866, when
she finally returned to England, dying at Fulham, on March 25th,
1877. Mrs. Chisholm, who was the author of several works on
emigration, was buried at Northampton, the obsequies being
performed by the Roman Catholic bishop. In 1867 Mrs. Chisholm was

May 24th, 1857, in charge of the force which occupied the fort of
Hote Murdaw. From August 1858 to Jan. 1860 he commanded a brigade
at Lucknow, and in Feb. 1861 embarked in command of the 70th
Regiment for New Zealand. He served with his regiment during the
Maori war, and in March 1863 was appointed brigadier in command of
the Australian colonies. In 1865 he succeeded General Cameron in
command of the forces in New Zealand, with the local rank of
Brigadier-General. In the following year he conducted a campaign in
the Wanganui district, capturing many <i>pas</i>, including Okatuku
(Jan. 4th, 1866), Putahi (Jan. 7th), Otapawa (Jan. 13th), and
Waikoko (Feb. 1st). The effect of this campaign was successfully to
open up the road between Wanganui and Taranaki. It was during these
operations that the shooting of a Maori prisoner of war by order of
General Chute led to subsequent complications between the Governor
(Sir George Grey) and the Colonial Office. Sir Trevor Chute, who

audiences, he returned to Australia, but shortly afterwards left
for England, where he remained till 1889, when he revisited
Australia, and achieved a considerable measure of his former
success.</p>

<p><a name="A270" id="A270"></a><b>Clark, John Howard</b>, son of
Francis Clark, of Birmingham, by his marriage with the sister of
Sir Rowland Hill, was born at Birmingham on Jan. 15th, 1830. He
emigrated to Adelaide with his father and mother in 1850, and
joined the former in the firm of Francis Clark &amp; Son,
accountants and merchants. He assisted in the formation of the
Adelaide Philosophical Society and the South Australian Institute,
and was secretary of the former for seven years. In 1865 he joined
the proprietary of the <i>South Australia Register</i>, and acted
as commercial manager, and in 1870 became editor. Mr. Clark (who
was well known as a press contributor under the <i>nom de plume</i>
of "Geoffrey Crabthorn") died at Port Willunga, on May 20th,
1878.</p>

<p><a name="A271" id="A271"></a><b>Clarke, Lieut.-General Hon. Sir
Andrew</b>, R.E., G.C.M.G., C.B., C.I.E., eldest son of the late
Colonel Andrew Clarke, K.H., of Belmont, co. Donegal, Governor of
Western Australia from 1846 to 1847, and Frances his wife, was born
on July 27th, 1824, at Southsea, Hants, and after a successful
career at the Woolwich Academy entered the Royal Engineers in 1844,
as second lieutenant. In 1846 he was appointed aide-de-camp to the
late Sir William Denison, who was then about to assume the
Governorship of Van Diemen's Land, and acted in that capacity till
1848, when he served in New Zealand until the close of the war,
when he was sent on a mission to Heke. In 1849 he returned to Van
Diemen's Land, now Tasmania, and acted as Sir William Denison's
private secretary till 1853, when he was appointed Surveyor-General
and Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands of Victoria, with a seat in
the Legislative Council. On responsible government being
inaugurated in Nov. 1855, Captain Clarke (as he then was) was
included in the Haines Ministry, and being; sworn of the Executive
Council, continued to act as Surveyor-General. In his address to
the electors of South Melbourne, in Sept. 1856, he advocated an
energetic railway policy, a reform in the constitution, the
abolition of the property qualification for members of Parliament,
a readjustment of the electoral districts on the basis of
population, the extension of the municipal system, and the
abolition of the technical difficulties which encumbered the
transfer of real estate. The working men of the colony took great
interest in Captain Clarke's candidature, and drew up an address to
the electors of South Melbourne, urging them to return him. After
his election to the first Legislative Assembly of Victoria, and
while a member of the Haines Administration, he carried several
railway bills through Parliament, and took an active part in the
policy of his colleagues. In March 1857 the Government was defeated
by a motion brought forward by Mr. (afterwards Sir John)
O'Shanassy, and resigned office. But the new Government only lasted
six weeks, and on April 29th Mr. Haines returned to power. But
Captain Clarke did not go into office with him, as he dissented
from his new policy, and less than twelve months afterwards
defeated his former colleagues on the bill for the representation
of minorities, and was requested by the Governor, Sir Henry Barkly,
to form an Administration. Be made the attempt, and obtained the
co-operation of Mr. O'Shanassy, while Sir William Stawell, who was
then Chief Justice, volunteered to resign his seat on the bench and
take office as Attorney-General. But one of the conditions demanded
by Captain Clarke was a dissolution, and as Sir Henry Barkly did
not see his way to grant that request, Captain Clarke gave up the
attempt to form an Administration, and Mr. O'Shanassy took office
with Mr. Duffy, Mr. Chapman, Mr. Ireland, and others as his
colleagues, in March 1858. This was the last occasion on which
Captain Clarke took a personal part in Victorian politics, and he
left Victoria towards the end of the year on a confidential mission
with which he was entrusted by Mr. O'Shanassy to assist, with his
advice, the six associated banks who were entrusted with the
flotation of the first Victorian loan. In 1859 he was suggested for
the position of the first Governor of Queensland, and his name was
sent for the approval of the Cabinet, but the appointment was not
made; and after being offered one or two colonial offices, he
resumed his military duties in 1858. He has, however, always
continued to take a keen interest in Australian affairs, and
especially in those of Victoria, for which colony he was on several
occasions Acting Agent-General in London down to 1892. Sir Andrew,
who was made C.B. in 1869, K.C.M.G. in 1873, C.I.E. in 1878, and
G.C.M.G. in 1885, may be regarded as the founder of municipal
institutions in Victoria, the official bill which he brought in for
their establishment in 1855 having laid the foundation of the
system, which has since been so widely and successfully extended.
Through his exertions the public reserves and the National Museum
were established on a permanent basis, and the first Melbourne
Industrial Exhibition was initiated by him. Sir Andrew Clarke, who
became captain in 1854, major and lieut.-colonel in 1867, colonel
in 1872, major-general in 1884, and who was placed on the retired
list with the honorary rank of lieut.-general in 1886, was employed
in various important official positions after leaving Victoria,
from which colony he draws a pension of £800 per annum, under the
50th clause of the Imperial Act establishing the constitution of
the colony. He was Commanding Royal Engineer of the Eastern and
Midlands districts till 1863, when he went to inspect the
establishments on the west coast of Africa, and was engaged in
operations against the Ashantees when they invaded the Gold Coast
Colony. Sir Andrew was Director of Works of the Navy from 1864 to
1873, and in this capacity designed and executed the great
extension of National dockyards. From 1873 to 1875 he was Governor
of the Straits Settlements, and initiated and conducted the
operations which stamped out piracy and established the permanent
authority of the Crown. In 1875 Sir Andrew was employed on a
special mission to Siam, and from that year till 1880, was director
of Indian Public Works, and a member of the Council of the Viceroy.
From 1881 to 1882 he was Commandant of the School of Military
Engineering at Chatham, and from the latter year until 1886
Inspector General of Fortifications. Sir Andrew, who was a member
of the Royal Commission for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, and
a member of the Commissions in London for the Melbourne Exhibitions
of 1880 and 1888, unsuccessfully contested Chatham against Sir John
Gorst, in 1886, as a Gladstonian Liberal. As acting Agent-General
and otherwise he has warmly vindicated the right of Australia to
dominate the Western Pacific, and to prevent the intrusion of
France and Germany. He married, in 1867, Mary Margaret Ellen,
eldest daughter of Charles W. Mackillop, formerly of the Indian
Civil Service.</p>

LL.B., fourth son of the late Henry Booth Clarke, of London, was
educated at London University, where he graduated LL.B. in 1877. He
entered at the Middle Temple in Nov. 1872, was called to the bar in
May 1876, and went the North-eastern Circuit. Mr. Clarke was
Attorney-General of Fiji from 1881 to 1882; Acting Chief Justice
and Chief Judicial Commissioner for the Western Pacific, from 1882
to 1883, and from 1884 to 1885, when he was permanently confirmed
in the office. Mr. Clarke was appointed to his present position as
Chief Justice, at Hong Kong, in 1892.</p>

<p><a name="A273" id="A273"></a><b>Clarke, Rev. George</b>, son of
George Clarke, of Wyndham, Norfolk, England, and Martha his wife
(<i>née</i> Blomfield), was born at Parramatta, N.S.W., in the year
1823. His father was one of the first missionaries sent out to New
Zealand by the Church Missionary Society; and in 1824 the family
proceeded to the Bay of Islands and took up their residence at
Waimate, the principal missionary station. At an early age Mr.
Clarke was sent to Tasmania for his education, which he received at
the school of Mr. R. W. Giblin at New Town, near Hobart. In 1838 he
returned to New Zealand. His proficiency as a Maori scholar, his
intimate knowledge of Maori customs, and his great influence with
the natives procured him an appointment as one of the protectors of
the aborigines. He was one of the witnesses to the celebrated
Treaty of Waitangi, whereby the Maori chiefs ceded the North Island
of New Zealand to the Queen. He was prominent in native matters
during the administrations of Governors Hobson, Fitzroy, and Grey.
He accompanied the surveying party of the New Zealand Company to
the South Island, and he drew up the document whereby the Otago
block, on which the city of Dunedin now stands, was conveyed to the
Company by the Maori chiefs. On the outbreak of the Honi Heki war
in 1844, he was employed by the Governor to negotiate with the
friendly natives, and accomplished his mission with great tact and
success. He accompanied Sir George Grey through the Heki war as
interpreter, and saw a large amount of active service. In 1846 Mr.
Clarke proceeded to England, and entered Highbury College
(afterwards New College), London, to study for the ministry of the
Congregational Church. In 1851 he returned once more to Hobart, and
accepted the pastorate of a Congregational Church, of which he has
now been the minister for forty years. For some years he edited a
monthly paper entitled <i>The Tasmanian Independent</i>, and took a
prominent part in the movement for the separation of Church and
State in the colony, which ended in the abolition of State aid to
religion in the year 1868. Mr. Clarke was a member of the Tasmanian
Council of Education for nearly thirty years, and was several times
elected its President. On the establishment of the University of
Tasmania in 1890, he was elected a member of the Council and first
Vice-Chancellor of the University. Besides a large amount of
literary work, he is the author of "Sunday Lectures on the Epistle
to the Hebrews" (Hobart, 1884). He married Martha, daughter of
Henry Hopkins, J.P.</p>

second son of the late Andrew Clarke, of Belmont, Donegal, Ireland,
and uncle of Lieut.-General Sir Andrew Clarke, G.C.M.G.
(<i>q.v.</i>), was born in 1801, and educated at the Military
College at Sandhurst, obtaining a commission in the army, out of
which he sold, and after graduating at Queens' College, Cambridge,
was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in Jan. 1835. In 1855 he
went to Victoria, and was appointed a County Court Judge, and Judge
of the Court of Mines in 1871. He married on Sept. 2nd, 1852, Miss
A. Maria Harrison, of London; retired on a pension in 1871, and
died at Mentone on Feb. 16th, 1886.</p>

<p><a name="A275" id="A275"></a><b>Clarke, Joseph</b>, J. P., third

M.L.C. (<i>q.v.</i>), was born at Newtown, near Hobart, Tas., on
Jan. 1st, 1835. He managed his father's Tasmanian estates for some
years prior to the latter's decease in 1874, when he succeeded to
large estates in that colony, and in South Australia and New
Zealand. Since that time Mr. Clarke has resided at Toorak, near
Melbourne. He married, in 1860, Caroline, daughter of his uncle,
Lewis Clarke, who settled in Australia. Mr. Clarke has given many
liberal donations to public institutions and
charities&mdash;notably £5000 to Trinity College, Melbourne, and
£5000 to the Anglican Cathedral of that city.</p>

<p><a name="A276" id="A276"></a><b>Clarke, Marcus (Andrew
Hislop)</b>, the distinguished Australian author, was the only son
of the late William Hislop Clarke, a London barrister, and nephew
of Col. Andrew Clarke, K.H., sometime Governor of Western
Australia. The family were of Anglo-Irish origin. Marcus Clarke was
born at Kensington, London, on April 24th, 1846, his mother dying a
few months after his birth. He was educated at Chomley School,
Highgate, under the late Rev. Dr. Dyne. His father dying when he
was only seventeen years of age, and leaving him nothing beyond a
few hundred pounds by way of patrimony, it was decided by his
friends that he should try his fortunes in Australia. He
accordingly went out in Green's old "liner" the <i>Wellesley</i> in
1864. On arriving in Melbourne he was taken in hand by his uncle,
the late James Langton Clarke, then a County Court Judge in
Victoria, who obtained for him a junior position in the Bank of
Australia in Melbourne. Figures were not, however, to his taste,
and after a brief and eccentric clerkly career, of which many
amusing stories are told, he relinquished banking and took to the
"bush," being sent in Jan. 1865 to acquire "colonial experience" on
Swinton station, near Glenorchy, in Victoria. The owner of the
station was Mr. John Holt, but his uncle had a pecuniary interest
in it; and young Clarke was thus permitted to lead a desultory,
half lazy, half literary life for a period of about two years,
during which he acquired "experiences" which, if not exactly those
designed, were of high value to him in his future career as a
writer, into which latter groove he now drifted. Amongst the
visitors to the station was a "materialistic philosopher" named Dr.
Lewins, who, struck with the youth's mental calibre and literary
capacities, mentioned his discovery of the bush genius to the late
Mr. Lachlan Mackinnon, of the Melbourne <i>Argus</i>, who at once
offered him an engagement on that paper, in the minor capacity of
theatrical reporter. This was gladly accepted, and all went
smoothly until one of young Clarke's criticisms unfortunately
antedated the appearance of a piece the first production of which
it presumably described. He was promptly removed from the regular
<i>Argus</i> staff, and became henceforth merely an occasional,
though most copious and capable, contributor to that paper and to
the well-known weekly journal the <i>Australasian</i>, issued from
the same office. In the latter his most brilliant effusions
appeared under the title of "The Peripatetic Philosopher." He also
contributed special articles, principally of theatrical criticism,
to the <i>Argus</i>, in whose columns they formed a striking and
favourite feature. Mr. Clarke purchased the <i>Australian
Magazine</i>, which he rechristened the <i>Colonial Monthly</i>,
and which he conducted. In its pages his first attempt at
novel-writing, "Long Odds," appeared in serial form. He, however,
wrote the first few chapters, the tale being finished by others,
Mr. Clarke, in taking a jump which his horse failed to negotiate,
being thrown with great violence and fracturing his skull. This was
in 1868. Narrowly escaping with life after a protracted illness,
Marcus Clarke resumed his literary activities, and about this time
took the principal part in founding the Yorick Club, of which he
was the first secretary, and which still flourishes as the leading
literary and Bohemian club of the Victorian metropolis. It was at
the Yorick that Marcus Clarke first made the acquaintance of Adam
Lindsay Gordon, the equally dashing poet and gentleman steeplechase
rider, for whom he formed a warm affection, and whose mournful end
he deeply deplored, as is evidenced by the sympathetic preface
which he wrote for the posthumous edition of Gordon's poems. At
this time Marcus Clarke both edited and contributed to
<i>Humbug</i>, a brilliant weekly comic journal published in
Melbourne, but which, like the <i>Colonial Monthly</i>, was
destined to be short-lived. Mr. Clarke stopped writing for the
Melbourne <i>Punch</i> when he took the editorship of <i>Humbug</i>
in 1869. In the former, however, some of his most sparkling work
appeared. Amongst Mr. Clarke's contributory staff on Humbug were
Dr. Neild, Mr. A. L. Windsor, Mr. Charles Bright, and Mr. Henry
Kendall. Altogether it was a formidable rival to Mr. James Smith's
<i>Touchstone</i>, a contemporary weekly of similar character. On
July 22nd, 1869, Mr. Clarke was married at St. Peter's Church,
Melbourne, to Miss Marian Dunn, daughter of John Dunn, the
well-known burlesque actor, and herself an actress of much
cleverness. Mr. Clarke now ventured on dramatic work, and wrote
<i>Foul Play</i>, a dramatisation of Reade and Boucicault's novel
of that name. It was produced at the Melbourne Theatre Royal, but
was only a partial success. Various succeeding adaptations were
more favourably received. Mr. Clarke now produced the great
literary work with which his name will always be associated in both
hemispheres, and which placed him at the head of Australian
authors. "His Natural Life" is a story based on the tragic
experiences of the old convict days, and is equally realistic and
repulsive in the horrors it reveals. It was written as the result
of a trip to Tasmania undertaken with the view of recruiting the
author's health. He not only attained the latter object, but
procured from the old convict records of the island the materials
for a most powerful narrative, "His Natural Life" at first appeared
serially in the <i>Australian Magazine</i>. It was, however,
revised almost beyond recognition prior to publication in England,
where it was issued by the Messrs. Bentley, and at once attracted
the favourable attention of the press and public. In the work of
revision and excision Mr. Clarke was assisted by Sir Charles Gavan
Duffy, to whom the work was dedicated on its appearance in book
form. Mr. Clarke also published a selection from stories
contributed to the Australasian under the title of "Old Tales of a
New Country." In Jan. 1870 he was appointed Secretary to the
Trustees of the Melbourne Public Library, organised by the late Sir
Redmond Barry, who recommended him to the position and always
remained his staunch friend. He became Sub-Librarian in 1876. Mr.
Clarke now published "Holiday Peak" and "Four Stories High"; and
his drama <i>Plot</i>, written in 1872 and produced at the
Princess's Theatre, Melbourne, also proved an undoubted success.
Mr. Clarke, having quarrelled with the <i>Argus</i> and
<i>Australasian</i> proprietary, became a contributor to the
<i>Evening Herald</i> and <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, both published in
Melbourne. He subsequently became connected with the <i>Age</i> and
<i>Leader</i>, and contributed much brilliant matter to the latter
above the signature "Atticus." The connection with both these
journals lasted till his death. In 1878 Mr. Clarke refused the
librarianship of the Victorian Parliamentary Library, offered him
by Mr. (now Sir Graham) Berry. He did this in the certainty of
obtaining the chief position in the Melbourne Public Library,
which, however, was, much to his disappointment, conferred on Dr.
Bride. His fame as a writer had in the meantime become widely
diffused, and he was offered a permanent position on the staff of
the London <i>Daily Telegraph</i> by its enterprising proprietor,
Mr. E. L. Lawson. This he was compelled to decline through
inability to leave Australia. He died in Melbourne on August 2nd,
1881, of congestion of the liver and erysipelas supervening on
pleurisy. Mr. Clarke left behind him an unfinished novel entitled
"Felix and Felicitas," which displayed remarkable promise. In 1884
a selection from his writings was published by subscription by
Messrs. Cameron, Laing &amp; Co., of Melbourne. It is entitled "The
Marcus Clarke Memorial Volume," and was edited by Mr. Hamilton
Mackinnon, who prefaced it by a detailed Life of his friend and a
complete list of his works, which is of much interest to the
student of Australian literature.</p>

<p><a name="A277" id="A277"></a><b>Clarke, William</b>, J.P., son
of William Joseph Sayers Clarke by his marriage with Miss Mary Ann
Welsford, was born in Melbourne on June 26th, 1843, and married
there on June 25th, 1862, to Miss Mary Ann Mortimer. He is a
Justice of the Peace for the colonies of New South Wales and
Victoria, and was M.L.A. for Orange in the former colony, but was
defeated at the general election in 1889. Mr. Clarke was Minister
of Justice in the administration of Sir Henry Parkes, from Jan.
20th, 1887, to Jan. 10th, 1889. He has held important positions in
connection with financial institutions in the colonies, and is now
Managing Director in London of the Standard Bank of Australia,
Limited. Mr. Clarke was a member of the New South Wales Commission
in London for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition of 1886.</p>

<p><a name="A278" id="A278"></a><b>Clarke, Rev. William
Branwhite</b>, M.A., F.R.S., was born at East Bergholt, in Suffolk,
on June 2nd, 1798, and educated at Dedham Grammar School and at
Jesus College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1821, and M.A.
in 1824. He was ordained deacon in 1821, and priest in 1824. In
1822 he published three poems: "Lays of Leisure," "Pompeii," and
"The River Derwent," and in 1839 "Recollections of a Visit to Mont
Blanc" and several religious poems. Whilst at Cambridge he attended
the geological lectures of Professor Sedgwick and Dr. E. Clarke,
and visited various parts of England in search of geological
information during his vacations. After holding one or two small
preferments he emigrated to New South Wales in 1839, partly for his
health. He took charge of the King's School at Parramatta, and did
clerical duty in that district, and subsequently at Campbell Town.
From 1846 to 1870 he was incumbent of St. Thomas's, Willoughby. Mr.
Clarke was the author of numerous treatises on scientific, and
especially geological, subjects. In 1841 he demonstrated the
existence of gold in New South Wales from geological and
mineralogical evidences, and verified his contentions by finding
specimens in the Macquarie valleys, and near the Vale of Clydd. In
1844 he described the existence of a goldfield in the Bathurst
district without any personal exploration, and without any
knowledge of Strzelecki's previous discovery, which exactly
coincided with his predictions. The then Governor of New South
Wales, Sir George Gipps, dreading the effect of exciting the
cupidity of the convicts and labourers, requested Mr. Clarke, as he
had done the Count previously, to keep his discoveries secret. With
this injunction Mr. Clarke was well inclined to comply, as,
according to his opinion declared in 1849, gold washing was more
suitable for slaves than British freemen. In comparing the geology
of Russia with that of Australia, in 1847, Mr. Clarke asserted that
New South Wales "would be found wonderfully rich in metals"&mdash;a
prophecy which has since been amply verified. For his services to
science he was in 1876 elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and
died on June 17th, 1878, at North Shore, Sydney For his geological
reports to the Government of New South Wales in 1853 Mr. Clarke was
awarded £1000, and, subsequently, £5000 was paid him. The
Government of Victoria awarded him £1000 in 1861. In July 1860 the
governors of the Australian colonies signed a certificate stating
that the discovery of gold was made by Mr. Clarke in 1841. He also
aided in developing the coalfields of New South Wales, and in 1877
was awarded the Murchison medal of the Geological Society of London
for his services in determining the age of the carboniferous
deposits in that colony. His labours also resulted in the discovery
of tin. When the Sydney University was founded, he declined a seat
in the Senate and the position of Professor of Geology.</p>

<p><a name="A279" id="A279"></a><b>Clarke, Hon. Sir William
John</b>, Bart. M.L.C., LL.D., J.P., is the eldest son of the late
Hon. W. J. T. Clarke, M.L.C. (<i>q.v.</i>), and was born in 1831 in
Tasmania. Sir William first arrived in Victoria in 1850, when he
spent a couple of years in the study of sheep farming on his
father's Dowling Forest station, and afterwards in the management
of the Woodlands station on the Wimmera. For the next ten years he
resided in Tasmania, working the Norton-Mandeville estate in
conjunction with his brother, Mr. Joseph Clarke. In 1862 he assumed
the management of his father's concerns in Victoria, and on the
latter's death in 1874 succeeded to his estates in that colony. Sir
William early evinced a very strong interest in farming pursuits,
and introduced a scientific instructor in the person of Mr. R. W.
E. McIvor, who lectured on agricultural chemistry for the benefit
of the colony generally. Amongst Sir William Clarke's donations to
public objects may be mentioned the gift of £2000 to the Indian
Famine Relief Fund, of £10,000 towards building the Anglican
Cathedral at Melbourne, of £7000 to Trinity College, Melbourne
University, and many others. In the domain of sport Sir William has
figured prominently as a patron of coursing and yachting. He is the
recognised head of the three Masonic constitutions in
Victoria&mdash;a unique position not held by any other individual
in the craft. On the death of Mr. John Thomas Smith, Sir William
became Prov. Grand Master of the Irish Constitution; he followed
the late Mr. A. K. Smith in the office of District Grand Master of
the Scotch Constitution; and on the demise of Captain Standish in
1883, Sir W. J. Clarke was offered the position of District Grand
Master of the English Constitution, the Prince of Wales signifying
his warm approbation. The foundation stone of the Freemasons Hall
in Melbourne was laid by him in March 1885, the finished building
being consecrated by him to Masonic purposes in March 1887. Sir
William founded, by a gift of 3000 guineas in the year 1882, the
"Southern Province (Victoria) Scholarship," in the Royal College of
Music, England, the distinction being first won in 1883 by Miss Ada
Beatrice Bloxham, and in 1887 by Miss Isabella Webster. To the
Melbourne Public Library he has presented some admirable statuary
by Mr. Charles Summers and a full-length portrait by Mr. Dowling of
Lord Melbourne, the minister after whom the Victorian metropolis is
named. In 1886 Mr. Chevalier painted to Sir William's order, "The
Renunciation of Prince Gautama," a work considered the painter's
masterpiece. The defence movement has been encouraged by Sir W. J.
Clarke's offer of valuable prizes for competition among the
military and naval forces; and in addition a battery of three
Nordenfeldt guns, commanded by Lieutenant Rupert Clarke&mdash;Sir
William's eldest son&mdash;is horsed and maintained at his expense.
Sir William has represented the Southern province in the
Legislative Council since 1878, and in the following year he was
President of the Melbourne International Exhibition; for his
services in connection with which, he was raised to the baronetcy
in Dec. 1882. Sir William was a member of the Victorian Commission
to the Colonial and Indian Exhibition of 1886, and had the honorary
degree of LL.D. conferred on him by the University of Cambridge
during the same year. Sir William Clarke married, firstly, on Nov.
23rd, 1860, Mary, second daughter of the Hon. John Walker, M.L.C,
of Tasmania, who died in 1871; and secondly, on Jan. 21st, 1873,
Janet Marian, eldest daughter of the late Hon. Peter Snodgrass,
M.L.C. and granddaughter of the late Colonel Kenneth Snodgrass,
C.B.</p>

Somersetshire. He settled in Tasmania in 1840, and subsequently
acquired extensive pastoral property in that colony, and in
Victoria, South Australia, and New Zealand. He married Eliza,
daughter of Rev. George Pyke Dowling, of Puckington, Somerset, by
Anne Biggs his wife, of an old and wealthy family of Bristol
merchants, and had issue three sons&mdash;William John (now Sir W.

father's Quorn Hall and Brambletye properties in Tasmania; and
Joseph (<i>q.v.</i>), who inherited the paternal estates in South
Australia, New Zealand, and Tasmania. Mr. Clarke was member for the
Southern Province in the Legislative Council, and again in
1874.</p>

<p><a name="A281" id="A281"></a><b>Clayden, Arthur</b>, was born in

labourers' movement, becoming a member of the consultative
committee of the National Agricultural Labourers' Union, under the
presidency of Mr. Joseph Arch. In 1873 he accompanied Mr. Arch to
Canada for the purpose of investigating that colony as a field of
emigration, contributing letters to the <i>Daily News</i> on the
subject. In 1879 he went out to New Zealand, and while there acted
as correspondent for the <i>Daily News</i>. He returned to England
in 1890. Mr. Clayden has delivered lectures on "New Zealand as an
Emigration Field"; and in 1885 read a paper before the Royal
Colonial Institute on "New Zealand in 1884." Some of his letters
and lectures have been published in pamphlet form.</p>

arriving in 1843. While in England in 1850 he took a prominent part
in the agitation for the grant of a constitutional government to

adventurous voyages, and engaging in various speculations, Captain
Cole in 1839 decided to settle in Sydney, and purchased land there;
but, after a visit to England, he changed his intention, and made
his home in Victoria, where he arrived in July 1840, and started

<p><a name="A291" id="A291"></a><b>Colenso, Rev. William</b>,
F.R.S., F.L.S., the representative of an old Cornish family, was
born at Penzance in 1811. He is a first cousin to the late Bishop
of Natal, John William Colenso, celebrated as a mathematician and
Biblical critic. In his youth he learned the arts of printing and
bookbinding and worked in the office of Watts &amp; Son, 2, Temple
Bar, Crown Court, where he was for a time engaged on work for the
British and Foreign Bible Society. In 1833, the Church Missionary
Society having decided to send out a press and outfit to New
Zealand, Mr. Colenso was engaged in the double capacity of
missionary and printer. After many difficulties and delays the
press and plant were landed at the Bay of Islands on Jan. 3rd,
1835. On opening his boxes, however, New Zealand's pioneer printer
found that he had no cases, leads, rules, ink-table, roller stocks,
nor frames, lye-brush nor potash, and, worst of all, no paper!
Fortunately he had provided himself with a composing stick, the
resident missionaries had a little writing paper among their
stores, the expert's ingenuity enabled him to supply other
requirements after a fashion, and on Feb. 17th, 1835, was worked
off, in the presence of admiring spectators, the first copy of the
first book printed in New Zealand&mdash;the Epistles to the
Ephesians and Philippians, in the Maori language. Surmounting all
difficulties, Mr. Colenso, in Dec. 1837, completed his great work,
the entire New Testament, in octavo, small pica type. Out of the
large edition of six thousand copies only one is now known to
exist, the volume being in Mr. Colenso's own possession. A full
account of the difficulties attending this publication, which reads
like a romance, will be found in Mr. Colenso's little book,
published in 1888, "Fifty Years Ago in New Zealand." The year 1840
saw the birth of the newspaper press, and thenceforward Mr. Colenso
chiefly devoted himself to missionary work, in the course of which
he traversed nearly the whole of the North Island on foot, and
twice over crossed the great snowy range of the Ruahine. For two
years he resided with Bishop Selwyn at St. John's College, Waimate.
In 1844 he took orders and settled down in Hawke's Bay, where he
has since remained. As a man of science Mr. Colenso has a good
reputation, ranking high as a botanist, and being an acknowledged
authority on Maori arts, antiquities, myths, and legendary lore. He
has also paid much attention to the natural history of the islands,
and has been for the last twenty years or more an active
contributor to "The Transactions of the New Zealand Institute."
Since his retirement from active missionary work he has filled
important public offices. In 1861 he was elected to represent
Napier in the first General Assembly and retained the seat for many
years. Under the old provincial system he was one of the town
representatives in the Provincial Council, and at various times
filled the offices of Provincial Treasurer and Inspector of
Schools. A few years since he was elected F.R.S. He was the first
to recognise the fossil remains of the Moa, and has in manuscript a
copious lexicon of the Polynesian language.</p>

H. Rogers. With this capable band of performers Mr. Coppin crossed
Bass's Straits in the schooner <i>Swan</i>, and, undertaking the
management of the Queen's Theatre, Melbourne, practically laid the
foundations of the drama in Port Phillip (1845). In 1852 he became
manager of the Geelong theatre, and in 1854 visited England, where
he entered into his historic engagement with the famous tragedian,
G. V. Brooke. With the energy that has always characterised him,
Mr. Coppin returned to Australia, taking out with him not only G.
V. Brooke and a company, but also an iron theatre, which he erected
in Lonsdale Street, Melbourne, and named the Olympic. Mr. Coppin
returned to Melbourne on Dec. 18th, 1854, and from that year to
1859 he and Brooke were in partnership. Through over-speculation in
the purchase of the Theatre Royal, and the laying-out of Cremorne
Gardens, the partnership ended in financial ruin; but it was during
those five years that the successful and unsuccessful diggers, and
all that early class of restless and eager pioneer colonists of
Victoria, saw in the tragedy and high comedy of Brooke, and the
irresistible broad humour of Coppin, perhaps the most memorable
performances in the annals of the Australian stage. Mr. Coppin next
visited America with the late Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kean. Before
this, in 1858, he had been elected to the Legislative Council for
the South-Western Province; but resigned his seat on leaving the
colony. On his return to Melbourne he again assumed the management
of the Theatre Royal; but the building, which was uninsured, was
almost immediately burnt down. He, however, rebuilt it in 1872, and
from that time his career has been one of ever-increasing
prosperity. Mr. Coppin claims to have built no less than six
theatres in the Australian colonies, and to have introduced two
hundred artistes, some, like Brooke and Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kean,
of the highest dramatic excellence. His own name is a household
word in Australia as the representative of certain characters in
broad comedy, of which Tony Lumpkin and Bob Acres are types. But he
is hardly less well known as a man of business and a politician. In
1874 he was returned for the important metropolitan constituency of
East Melbourne; and he has left his mark on the statute-book as the
founder of the Post Office Savings Bank. Mr. Coppin is also the
founder of the Old Colonists' Association, the Victorian Humane
Society, the Dramatic and Musical Association, and has been for
years a Director of the Commercial Bank, as well as of innumerable
financial companies. In conjunction with Sir Charles Gavan Duffy,
he practically made the fashionable watering-place of Sorrento; and
Mr. Coppin further claims to have introduced the camel and the
English thrush into the colonies. He sat for East Melbourne until
1889, when he was defeated, and in August of that year entered the
Upper House for Melbourne province.</p>

place among the notable colonists of New Zealand, not through any
remarkable act which distinguished his long life, but because of
his deathbed philanthropy. He was known among the "old identities"
of Auckland as a man of rather penurious and retiring habits, who
had acquired property in the early days, which, with the growth of
the city, had become of great value. On his deathbed he summoned
his lawyer, and directed him to divide his wealth among the city
charities, seven of these being named. The estate realised £93,000,
which was divided between the Auckland Hospital, Old Men's Home,
Sailors' Home, Auckland Institute, Costley Training Institute,
Auckland Public Library, and the Parnell Orphan Home, each of which
received £12,500. Since Mr. Costley's death an unsigned draft will

James Huybers, J.P., of Hobart, Tas., and was born at Highgate,
near London, being brought out as an infant by her parents to
Tasmania in the early half of the fifties. Her father originally
came from Antwerp to reside in England, and thence proceeded to
Hobart, where the future novelist remained until her first
marriage, when she went to live in Victoria, where her first story,
"Barren Love" (recently republished by her in London in the
collection "A Sydney Sovereign"), appeared in Mr. Garnet Walsh's
Annual of 1877. She also contributed original tales, sketches, and
essays to the <i>Australasian</i> and the <i>Melbourne Review</i>.
In 1879 she went to reside permanently in Europe, which she had
visited a few years previously. From 1880 to 1882 she lectured in
French on Australia in France and Belgium for the Geographical
Society of Paris. She also wrote for Madame Adam's <i>Nouvelle
Revue</i>, and received from the French Government the decoration
of Officier d'Académie. In 1883-4 she revisited Australia. On her
return to Europe she was married in 1885 to M. Auguste Couvreur,
the well-known Belgian publicist, and has resided since in
Brussels. M. Couvreur, who is the senior foreign member of the
Cobden Club, and has been connected with the <i>Independence
Belge</i> both as contributor and editor, was for twenty years one
of the Liberal representatives of Brussels, and for four years
Vice-President of the Chamber. In 1889, under her
<i>nom-de-plume</i> "Tasma," Madame Couvreur published in London
her first complete novel, entitled "Uncle Piper of Piper's
Hill"&mdash;a story of Australian life and manners, which was most
highly commended by the leading literary critics in England and on
the Continent. Her second novel, "In her Earliest Youth," published
in 1890, is likewise Australian, and was equally well received by
the press. About the same time "Tasma" also brought out the
collection of short tales called "A Sydney Sovereign." She has now
a new one-volume novel in the press entitled "A White Feather," and
from time to time she has contributed an occasional story to Mr.
Edmund Yates's society journal, the <i>World</i>. Since her
residence in Europe, Madame Couvreur has sent various contributions
to the Melbourne <i>Australasian</i>, and is generally recognised,
particularly in Victoria and Tasmania, as one of the leading
writers, who, if not actually born, have been entirely educated in
the colonies. "Tasma" contributed to Mr. Mennell's "In Australian
Wilds" (published by Hutchinson &amp; Co.), and in Christmas 1890 a

Archdeacon William Cowper, D.D. (<i>q.v.</i>), was born at Drypool,
Yorkshire, on April 26th, 1807, and when two years old was brought
to Sydney by his father. He was educated privately, and entered the
Commissariat department under Commissary-General Wemyss, being
appointed secretary to the Church and School Lands Corporation in
1826 by Governor Sir Charles Darling. In 1831 he married Eliza,
second daughter of Daniel Sutton, of Wivenhoe, near Colchester,
Essex. When the Church and School Lands Corporation was dissolved
in 1833 Mr. Cowper went to reside in the county of Argyle, and held
some sheep stations on the Murray. He was made a magistrate of the
territory in 1839, and in 1843 he contested Camden with Mr. Roger
Therry, Attorney-General, and was only defeated by ten votes. Being
immediately invited to stand for the county of Cumberland, he was
returned to the Legislative Council by a large majority, defeating
even so popular a man as the late Sir James Macarthur. He was
chairman of a company formed in 1846 for railway construction, and
in 1851 he contested Sydney against Dr. Lang, Captain Lamb, and Mr.
Wentworth, but was defeated. He was then returned for Durham. He
introduced the Act for incorporating the Sydney Grammar School, and
that for establishing colleges affiliated to the university. He was
offered the position of Chief Commissioner of the city of Sydney,
with a salary of £1000 a year, by Sir Charles Fitzroy; but declined
it. At the general election in 1856 he was returned for Sydney to
the first Legislative Assembly. On the resignation of the Donaldson
Ministry, the first which held office under responsible government,
in August 1856, Mr. Cowper was sent for by Sir W. Denison, and
requested to form a Ministry. He was successful in that object, and
himself held the post of Colonial Secretary, having for his
colleagues the late Mr. Robert Campbell, Mr. (afterwards Sir)
Terence A. Murray, Mr. (afterwards Sir) James Martin, and Mr.
(afterwards Judge) Lutwyche. Objection was taken by the Opposition
to the personal composition of the Ministry, and they were defeated
and resigned in October, after holding office for six weeks. In
Sept. 1857 Mr. Cowper became Premier and Colonial Secretary for the
second time, and held office till Oct. 1859, passing the Electoral
Act in 1858. His administration were defeated on their education
policy, and Mr. Forster succeeded, but was ejected in less than
five months, when Mr. (afterwards Sir) John Robertson's first
Ministry was formed, with Mr. Cowper as Colonial Secretary. Under
their ægis the famous Land Bill of 1861 was carried, and also a
measure prohibiting future grants in aid of the religious bodies.
In Jan. 1861 Mr. Robertson, whilst continuing to hold office as
Secretary for Lands, surrendered the Premiership to Mr. Cowper, who
held it till Oct. 1863, when the Martin Ministry came in, but was
in turn defeated in Feb. 1865, when Mr. Cowper became Premier and
Colonial Secretary for the third time in a period of great
financial difficulty, and he resorted to <i>ad valorem</i> duties
to tide the colony over the crisis. In Jan. 1866 Mr. Martin again
came into power; and the Robertson Ministry having intervened, Mr.
Cowper became Premier and Colonial Secretary for the fifth time in
Jan. 1870. He, however, resigned in December following, to become
Agent-General for New South Wales in London. As a mark of
appreciation of his public services the estate of Wivenhoe was
purchased by public subscription, and settled on Lady Cowper. Mr.
Cowper was created K.C.M.G., and died on Oct. 19th, 1875, in
London, having resigned the AgentGeneralship some time
previously.</p>

<p><a name="A324" id="A324"></a><b>Croke, The Most Rev. Thomas
William</b>, D.D., Archbishop of Cashel, Ireland, formerly Bishop
of Auckland, N.Z., was born in Mallow, Cork, on May 19th, 1824. His
career at the Irish College in Rome was remarkably distinguished.
He carried off the gold and silver medals in 1846, and next year
was ordained to the priesthood and awarded the degree of Doctor of
Divinity. After holding professional appointments in Carlow and
Paris, Dr. Croke engaged in missionary work in his native county.
In 1858 he became President of St Colman's College, Fermoy, and
seven years later received the dual appointment of parish priest of
Doneraile and Chancellor of the Diocese of Cloyne. He was
discharging the duties of this twofold office, when in 1870 he was
nominated by Pius IX. to the bishopric of Auckland. On arriving in
New Zealand Dr. Croke found himself confronted by a very heavy
uphill task. He found his diocese exceedingly depressed and
disorganised, the bitter legacy of recent wars between the British
and the Maoris, but he went to work with characteristic energy and
perseverance. He laboured zealously in building churches and
founding missions all over the North Island of New Zealand. He
devoted himself in a very special manner to the evangelising of the
Maoris, with whom he became exceedingly popular, not only as an
ecclesiastic, but as an athlete. A bishop who never inquired about
gates, but took at a jump every fence or obstacle that came in his
way, was just the type of prelate to captivate these brave and
high-spirited children of nature. In 1874 Dr. Croke revisited
Europe with the object of securing a further supply of missionaries
for his Maori people, but it so happened that the archiepiscopal
see of Cashel became vacant while he was in the Northern
hemisphere, and Pius IX. insisted on his filling the position. The
leading part that Dr. Croke has played in Irish politics since his
elevation to the see of Cashel is too well known to need any
detailed reference in this place.</p>

Lodewyk</b>, M.L.C., M.D., is the son of William Crowther, M.R.C.S.
(who emigrated to Tasmania), and grandson of Philip Wyatt Crowther,
Comptroller of the City of London. He married Victoire Marie
Louise, daughter of General Muller, Equerry-in-waiting to the Duke
of Kent, who was Mrs. Crowther's godfather. Dr. Crowther sat in the
Legislative Council of Tasmania, and was a member of the Reibey
Ministry without portfolio from July 1876 to August 1877. In Dec.
1878 he formed an Administration, in which he was Premier without
office until Oct. 1879. Dr. Crowther died on April 12th, 1885.</p>

<p><a name="A328" id="A328"></a><b>Cullen, Edward Boyd</b>, eldest
son of the Rev. J. G. Cullen. was born on March 19th, 1827, and
educated in his father's parish of Balmaclellan, Kirkcudbright. He
emigrated to New South Wales about 1849, and after some of the
usual vicissitudes of colonial life became a clerk in the Bank of
New South Wales. In this capacity he opened a branch at Ipswich,
Queensland, but retired from the bank, and engaged in pastoral
pursuits. On the establishment of the Ipswich Municipal Council, he
became the first town clerk, and acted as secretary to the old
North Australian Club in that town. Mr. Cullen in 1861 entered the
Queensland Civil Service, being appointed Chief Clerk in the
Treasury in 1862, and Under-Secretary to that department in Oct.
1877. He is also a Commissioner of Stamp Duties, and in Oct. 1880
was appointed Accountant-General of the Supreme Court of
Queensland.</p>

<p><a name="A329" id="A329"></a><b>Cuninghame, Archibald</b>, was a
barrister in Melbourne "in the early days," and attained to
prominence in the public affairs of the inchoate community. In
1845, prior to the separation of Port Phillip (Victoria) from New
South Wales, it was proposed by the authorities of the latter
colony to float an immigration loan in London, as security for
which the lands of Port Phillip would be pledged, as well as those
of the Mother colony. Under these circumstances a public meeting
was held of the leading residents of Port Phillip, under the
presidency of the Mayor of Melbourne, on Sept. 28th, 1845, for the
purpose of taking into consideration the necessity of petitioning
the Queen against the proposed scheme for pledging the lands of
Port Phillip jointly with those of New South Wales proper, and to
consider the propriety of appointing an agent to proceed to England
to protest against the course proposed, and also to further the
great cause of separation. The meeting passed resolutions against
any further alienation of the land fund to afford labour to the
middle district, and the scheme was also objected, to as creating a
new and almost insurmountable barrier to separation. The assemblage
appointed Mr. Cuninghame as their delegate to proceed to England to
represent the views of the colonists at the centre of the Empire,
and he was thus the first somewhat informally selected
Agent-General of Victoria in London. A committee was also nominated
to frame instructions for the guidance of the delegate, and to draw
up a petition, requesting the Colonial Secretary to hold his hand
until Mr. Cuninghame's arrival in London. On the committee were
such well-known names as those of Curr, Westgarth, Niel Black,
Stephen Henty, William Campbell, Verner, Stawell (afterwards Sir
William), Pohlman, McCombie, Dalgety, and O'Shanassy. Mr.
Cuninghame continued to represent the colony in England for some
years, and died at the family residence, Thornton House,
Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, in October 1856, without having revisited
Australia. He was the eldest son of Lieut.-Col. John Cuninghame of
Caddall and Thornton, and Sarah his wife, only child of Major John
Peebles.</p>

<p><a name="A330" id="A330"></a><b>Curnow, Francis</b>, J.P., was
appointed District Clerk and Paymaster in the Roads Department at
Ipswich, Qd., in March 1864; organiser of the Railway Store
Department in Nov. 1865; Railway Storekeeper in June 1866;
Administrator of the Locomotive Branch of the Railway Department,
in addition, in June 1876, and Chief Clerk of Railways in Jan.
1877. In Jan. 1884 Mr. Curnow became Acting Commissioner of
Railways, was permanently appointed in March 1885, and retired on a
pension in July 1889.</p>

<p><a name="A331" id="A331"></a><b>Curnow, William</b>, the present
editor of the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, was born in Cornwall,
and emigrated to Australia in the year 1854. He had been in England
a student for the ministry of the Wesleyan Church, and on arriving
in Australia became an assistant minister in Queensland, being for
some period in the Warwick district. He afterwards went to New
South Wales, and resided for a number of years at Goulburn. He
finally became the minister of the chief Wesleyan Church in Sydney,
and remained in this position till about 1877, when, his health
railing, he made a voyage to England. For some years Mr. Curnow had
been editor of a religious newspaper in connection with the
Wesleyan communion, and had also been an occasional contributor to
the Sydney Morning Herald. On his return from England, with the
throat affection from which he suffered still uncured, he resigned
his charge, and became a member of the staff of the <i>Sydney
Morning Herald</i>. When Dr. Garran retired from the editorship in
1885, after many years of service, Mr. Curnow became editor.</p>

<p><a name="A332" id="A332"></a><b>Curr, Edward Micklethwaite</b>,
the eldest son of the late Edward Curr, was born in Hobart,
Tasmania, in 1820, educated in England and France, and in 1841 and
subsequent years was a stockowner in Victoria, Queensland and New
South Wales. In 1862 he was appointed an Inspector of Sheep in
Victoria, and later on Chief Inspector of Stock. At that date there
were five millions of sheep suffering from scab in the colony, the
annual loss on which was computed at over half a million sterling.
Parliament offered a prize of £150 for the best essay on scab. The
prize was given to Mr. Curr, and eventually the steps recommended
therein were adopted, and the disease got rid of entirely. His
essay was reprinted by the Government of Tasmania, and has been in
demand in various parts of the world. In 1863 Mr. Curr published a
work entitled "Pure Saddle Horses," in 1883 "Recollections of
Squatting in Victoria," and in 1886 "The Australian Race" was
published for him by the Government of Victoria. Mr. Curr's father,
the late Edward Curr, of St. Heliers, was styled in Victoria " the
Father of Separation," from the efforts which he exerted to secure
severance from New South Wales. This gentleman had been manager for
the Van Diemen's Land Company. Between 1827 and 1830 he induced the
company to lay out £30,000 in the importation from Europe of prime
sheep, chiefly merinos, and further sums on pure cattle and
high-bred horses. From the merinos thus imported, which were from
the very best flocks of Germany, the leading flocks of Australia
are principally descended. Mr. Curr resigned his position as Chief
Inspector of Stock on July 30th, 1889, and died on August 3rd,
1889.</p>

was for many years a member of the Nelson Provincial Council, and
was Superintendent of the province from 1867 to 1876, when the
provinces were abolished. Mr. Curtis was a member of the New
Zealand House of Representatives from 1867 to 1878, and was
Postmaster-General and Commissioner of Customs, Stamp Duties, and
Telegraphs in the short-lived Stafford administration from Sept.
10th to Oct. 11th, 1872. Mr. Curtis was for many years resident

M.L.C., the eldest son of John Cuthbert, of Roscommon, Ireland, was
born at that place on July 29th, 1829. In 1854 he was admitted a
solicitor in Ireland, and the same year left for Victoria, where he
was at once admitted to practice. In 1855 he went to Ballarat, and,
besides being successful in his profession, became largely
interested in mining. He was the original promoter of the
well-known Buninyong Gold Mining Company. In 1874 Mr. Cuthbert was
returned to the Legislative Council, unopposed, for the
South-Western Province, and is now one of the representatives of
the Wellington Province in that body. Mr. Cuthbert held the office
of Postmaster-General in the second Berry Administration from July
1877 to July 1878, when he resigned in consequence of inability to
support the Government scheme for Reform of the Council. In March
1880 he joined Mr. Service's Ministry as Commissioner of Customs
and Postmaster-General, and held office till the defeat of the
Government in the following August. Mr. Cuthbert was Minister of
Justice under Mr. Gillies from Feb. 1886 to Nov. 1890. He married
in May 1863 the second daughter of Mr. Kirby, of Melbourne, and was

sometime Agent-General for Queensland, was born at Hemingford
Abbotts, Huntingdonshire, in Dec. 1851, and was educated at Bedford
Grammar School and Christ's College, Cambridge. Being in delicate
health, he was recommended a voyage to Australia, and arrived in
Victoria in 1852, where he was employed as assistant to Mr. Selwyn,
the Government Geologist, from 1854 to 1856, when Mr. Daintree
returned to England, and was for six months a student in Dr.
Percy's laboratory in the Royal School of Mines. In August 1857 Mr.
Daintree returned to Melbourne, and in 1858 was appointed Field
Geologist on the Geological Survey of Victoria, on which he worked
for seven years, paying special attention to the Cape Patterson
coal formation and the exploration of the Bass river. Having
resigned his post in Victoria and engaged in squatting pursuits in
North Queensland, he was appointed Government Geologist for North
Queensland in 1868, and in March 1872 Agent-General for the colony
in London. He held this position till 1876, when he was compelled
to resign through ill-health. He had been created C.M.G. in 1875,
and died on June 25th, 1878.</p>

<p><a name="A337" id="A337"></a><b>Daldy, Captain William
Crush</b>, was born at Rainham, Essex, in 1816. He arrived in New
Zealand in 1841, having brought out the schooner <i>Shamrock</i>,
eighty-five tons. On the voyage to Launceston he touched at Tahiti.
The trouble with the French was then going on, and Captain Daldy
was arrested as a political prisoner, and tried on the beach by a
black judge and jury. This caused considerable correspondence
between the Governments of the day. Captain Daldy arrived in
Auckland on July 1st, 1841, on which day the first Custom House was
opened. He traded for some time with the schooner between Sydney
and Auckland. In 1845 he returned to England in charge of the
barque <i>Bellina</i>, the first vessel loaded at Auckland with
merchandise for export to England. The cargo was somewhat mixed,
including copper ore from Kawau, kauri gum, manganese from Waiheki,
and the first export of wool, consisting of two bales. During the
voyage home Dr. Martin and Mr. William Brown, who were passengers,
both wrote their books on New Zealand. Captain Daldy returned to
Auckland in 1847, and two years later commenced business as a
general merchant and shipping agent in the firm of Coombes and
Daldy. He was elected to the House of Representatives, and from May
to June 1856 was a member of the Fox Ministry. Captain Daldy
participated actively in provincial politics, holding various
offices, and during the Maori disturbances he commanded a company
of volunteers. In 1865 he again visited England, and for twelve
months acted as agent for the Government, during which period he
sent out a thousand emigrants. He has held many offices in
connection with the municipal government of Auckland, was at one
time captain of a volunteer fire brigade, and officiated for seven
years as Chairman of the Harbour Board.</p>

<p><a name="A338" id="A338"></a><b>Dalley, Right Hon. William
Bede</b>, P.C., Q.C., was born in Sydney in 1831, of Irish Roman
Catholic parentage, and was admitted to the New South Wales bar in
1856. Having early displayed great oratorical ability, he was
returned to the Assembly for the city of Sydney in the first
Parliament elected under responsible government, and was
Solicitor-General in the Cowper Ministry from Nov. 1858 to Feb.
1859. Subsequently he retired from political life, and devoted
himself to the practice of his profession, with the exception of a
short interval, during which he visited England, in conjunction
with Mr. (now Sir) Henry Parkes, on an official mission for the
promotion of emigration to New South Wales. They delivered
addresses at most of the main centres of population in the United
Kingdom: but little or no success attended their efforts, owing to
the anti-democratic feeling aroused by the outbreak of the American
war. Having been nominated to the Legislative Council in 1875, he
accepted office under Mr. (now Sir) John Robertson, and was
Attorney-General from February of that year to March 1877, when he
resigned with his colleagues, resuming office in the same capacity
in Sir John Robertson's fourth Administration in August 1877. This
Government only lasted till December of the same year, and Mr.
Dalley remained out of office till Jan. 1883, when he became
Attorney-General in the Ministry of Mr. (afterwards Sir) Alexander
Stuart. It was whilst filling the post of acting Premier in this
Administration, during the absence through illness of Sir Alexander
Stuart, that Mr. Dalley took on himself the responsibility of
despatching the New South Wales contingent to the aid of the
Imperial troops operating in the Soudan. The Ministry resigned in
Oct. 1885, and Mr. Dalley (who had refused knighthood, and also the
succession to the Chief Justiceship vacated by the death of Sir
James Martin in 1886) was in the latter year appointed a member of
the English Privy Council, being the first Australian statesman
upon whom that honour was conferred. He retired from the
Legislative Council in 1887 on the ground of ill-health, and died
on Oct. 30th, 1888. Mr. Dalley, who was not only an accomplished
orator, but a man of remarkable artistic culture and great literary
ability, was looked upon as the foremost representative of the
Roman Catholic party in Australia. He had been a widower for some
years, and left two sons. A medallion tablet, executed by Sir Edgar
Boehm, was erected to his memory in St. Paul's Cathedral by public
subscription in 1890, the ceremony of unveiling it being performed
by Lord Rosebery, who delivered an impressive address on the
occasion.</p>

Queensland, was the tenth son of Sir Robert Dalrymple Horn
Elphinstone, Bart., by his marriage with Graeme, daughter of
Colonel David Hepburn, and was born on May 6th, 1826. He went to
Australia as aide-de-camp to the late Sir George Gipps, Governor of
New South Wales, and became a partner with Mr. (now Sir Arthur)
Hodgson in squatting ventures in the Moreton Bay district. He was
one of the early explorers of what is now the colony of Queensland.
In 1859 he explored the country between the parallels of 19° and
20° S., and greatly extended the knowledge of the country which
Leichardt, Mitchell, Kennedy, and Gregory had primarily, opened up.
In 1862 he made a second journey, and traced an opening from the
Valley of Lagoons to Rockingham Bay in Queensland. Mr. Dalrymple,
after whom the town of Dalrymple was named, sat in the Legislative
Assembly of New South Wales before Queensland was severed from New
South Wales, and soon after separation was effected entered the
Legislative Assembly of Queensland, and became Colonial Secretary
in Mr. (now Sir Robert) Herbert's second ministry in July 1866; but
did not remain in the Government when it was reconstructed under
Mr. Macalister (who took the portfolio of Colonial Secretary) in
the following month. He died on Jan. 22nd, 1876.</p>

Governor of South Australia, was the third son of Dominic Daly by
his wife Joanna Harriet, eldest daughter of Joseph Blake, of
Ardfry, co. Galway, and sister of the 1st Lord Wallscourt. He was
born at Ardfry on August 11th, 1798, and was educated at Oscott
Roman Catholic College, near Birmingham. He went to Canada in 1822
as private secretary to Sir Francis Burton, and in 1825 was
appointed Assistant-Secretary to the Government of Lower Canada.
Two years later he was appointed Provincial Secretary for Lower
Canada; and upon the union of the Canadas, in 1840, became
Provincial Secretary for the united provinces and member of the
Board of Works with a seat in the Council. He retired from the
latter post in 1846, and from the former in 1848, but continued to
represent the county of Megantic in the Canadian parliament.
Subsequently returning to England, he was, in Oct. 1849, placed on
the Commission of Inquiry into the the New and Waltham Forest
rights. Sir Dominic was Lieut.-Governor of Tobago from 1852 to
1854, when he was appointed Lieut.-Governor of Prince Edward
Island, and was knighted by patent in 1856. He left Prince Edward
Island in 1859, and assumed office as Governor-in-Chief of South
Australia in March 1862. His administration, which only terminated
with his death on Feb. 19th, 1868, was highly popular with all
classes, and though a Roman Catholic, with the representatives of
all the religious bodies. During his <i>régime</i> H.R.H. the Duke
of Edinburgh visited the colony, and the Northern Territory was
included within its limits. Sir Dominic married, on May 20th, 1826,
Caroline Maria, second daughter of Ralph Gore, of Barrowmount, co.
Kilkenny, who survived her husband, and died at Glenelg, South
Australia, on July 16th, 1872, aged seventy-one years.</p>

colony. He was appointed Surveyor under the South Australian
Government in 1866, and took part in the Northern Territory
Expedition from 1868 to 1870. From Feb. 1874 to March 1875 he was
employed in the Engineer-in-Chief's Department, and was then
appointed Surveyor for the Native States in the Malayan Peninsula.
He died on July 15th, 1889, in Borneo. Mr. Daly married Harriett,
daughter of Benjamin Douglas, formerly Collector of Customs in
South Australia, and afterwards Government Resident of the Northern
Territory. She has written several works.</p>

<p><a name="A342" id="A342"></a><b>Dampier, Alfred</b>, was born in

professional career at Stratford-on-Avon, and subsequently
travelled with a company through the chief provincial towns of
England and Scotland. In 1872, while playing in Manchester, he was
engaged by Mr. H. R. Harwood, then one of the managers of the
Theatre Royal, Melbourne, whither he proceeded; and in the
following year made his <i>début</i> in Australia as Mephistopheles
in his own version of Goethe's <i>Faust</i>. After a three years'
engagement in Melbourne, during which period he appeared
successfully in Hamlet, Othello, Iago, Richard III., Jaques, and
other leading parts, Mr. Dampier visited Sydney, Adelaide, and New
Zealand, and thence proceeded to America and London, where, at the
Surrey Theatre, he produced, among other pieces, the drama <i>All
for Gold</i>, by Mr. F. R. Hopkins, the Australian dramatist.
During his various engagements in Australia, America, and England,
Mr. Dampier's daughters, Rose and Lily, came into great prominence
by their acting in a dramatic version of <i>Helen's Babie's</i>
written by Mr. Garnet Walch, of Melbourne. Mr. Dampier returned to
Australia, and became lessee of the Alexandra Theatre, which he
rechristened the Australian, and there produced with great success
a drama founded on Rolf Boldrewood's "Robbery under Arms," written
by Mr. Garnet Walch and himself, and in which he appeared as the
hero, Captain Starlight. In 1868 Mr. Dampier married Katherine
Alice, daughter of T. H. Russell, of Birmingham.</p>

called to the bar in June 1854. He was nominated to the Legislative
Council of New South Wales in 1883. Mr. Dangar married Lucy,

Dublin, where he graduated B.A. in 1851. He was called to the Irish
bar in Jan. 1853, and went the Munster Circuit. Having determined
to try his fortunes in Australia, he went to New South Wales, and
was admitted to the bar there in June 1862. In Sept. 1868 he was
called to the Legislative Council Having practised at the bar with
success, he was made Q.C. in 1878. From Nov. 1881 to Jan. 1883 Sir
Frederick was Vice-President of the Executive Council, and
represented the Parkes Government in the Legislative Council. Upon
the death of Sir James Martin in Nov. 1886 he was offered the
position of Chief Justice; this he refused, whereupon Sir Julian
Salomons was appointed to that office. On his resignation, however,
before he was sworn in, the position was again pressed upon Sir
Frederick, who finally accepted the office, and was knighted in
April 1887. Sir Frederick was married at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire,
England, on Dec. 13th, 1860, to Miss Lucy Forest Browne.</p>

<p><a name="A345" id="A345"></a><b>Darling, Sir Charles Henry</b>,
K.C.B., third Governor of Victoria, was the eldest son of
Major-General Henry Charles Darling, Lieut.-Governor of Tobago from
1833 to 1845, by his marriage with the eldest daughter of Charles
Cameron, Governor of the Bahamas. He was the nephew of Sir Ralph
Darling, Governor of New South Wales from 1825 to 1831, and was
born in Nova Scotia in 1809. He was educated at Sandhurst Military
College, whence he obtained an ensign's commission without purchase
in the 57th Regiment of Foot in Dec. 1825. In 1827 he was appointed
assistant private secretary to his uncle, the then Governor of New
South Wales, and in 1830 became his military secretary. When Sir
Ralph Darling retired in 1831, his nephew re-entered the senior
department of the Sandhurst Military College, and in 1833 was
appointed on the staff of Sir Lionel Smith, whom he served as
military secretary in the West Indies from 1833 to 1836, and in
Jamaica from 1836 to 1839. Sir Charles Darling was made captain in
1839, and retired from the army in 1841. Two years later he was
appointed by Lord Elgin, then Governor of Jamaica, Agent-General
for Immigration and Adjutant-General of Militia on that island.
Subsequently he was the Governor's secretary till 1847, when he was
appointed Lieut.-Governor of St. Lucia, and in 1851 Lieut.-Governor
of the Cape Colony during the temporary absence of Sir George
Cathcart, on whose permanent departure he acted as administrator
from May to Dec. 1854, during which period parliamentary government
was established in the colony. Sir Charles Darling was then
appointed Governor of Antigua and the Leeward Islands, but never
took up the appointment, as on his return home he was sent to
administer the government of Newfoundland, where he inaugurated
responsible government, and acted as Governor until Feb. 1857, when
he was appointed Governor of Jamaica. In 1863 he was nominated
successor to Sir Henry Barkly as Governor of Victoria, and assumed
office on Sept. 11th of that year. He unfortunately arrived on the
eve of the most embittered crisis which ever disturbed the politics
of the colony. The facts of "the deadlock," as it was called, will
be found fully narrated in the notice of Sir James McCulloch, and
need not be recapitulated here. Suffice it to say that Sir Charles
Darling went heart and soul with his Ministry and the majority in
the lower house in their contest with the upper chamber over the
rejection of the Protectionist tariff both in its separate form,
and as a "tack" to the Appropriation Bill of the year. A protest
was sent home by the Legislative Council, and at the end of 1865 a
petition was sent to the Queen protesting against the Governor's
conduct, signed by twenty-two out of the forty-five executive
councillors of the colony. In commenting on this petition in a
despatch to Mr. Cardwell, the then Colonial Secretary, Sir Charles
Darling made a fierce attack on the signatories, accusing them of
"a treacherous conspiracy against the Governor" and intimating that
but for liability to misapprehension he would "have suspended them
all from office until her Majesty's pleasure was known." He then
incautiously declared it " impossible that the relations between
the petitioners and myself can, in the face of this conspiracy, be
such as ought to subsist between the Governor and gentlemen holding
the commission of an executive councillor, whether occupying or not
responsible office; and it is at least to be hoped that the future
course of political events may never designate any of them for the
position of a confidential adviser of the Crown, since it is
impossible their advice could be received with any other feelings
than those of doubt and distrust." A little later, and a despatch
was received from Mr. Cardwell plainly intimating that the
Governor's conduct in assenting to the devices of his Ministry for
obtaining money without the assent of Parliament had been
inconsistent with the policy announced by himself of rigid
adherence to the law. The despatch did not, however, go beyond
censure. A second, received in April 1866, in reply to that of Sir
Charles Darling above quoted, however, contained the mandate of
dismissal, Mr. Cardwell pointing out with a cogency which it was
impossible to dispute that Sir Charles Darling had precluded
himself by his conduct from acting freely with those whom the
course of parliamentary proceedings might present to him as
confidential advisers. "It is your own act now," Mr. Cardwell
insisted with merciless logic, "which leaves me no alternative. You
force me to decide between yourself and the petitioners. It must be
evident to yourself that you occupy a position of personal
antagonism...It is impossible after this that you can with
advantage continue to conduct the government of the colony." On the
other hand, the Legislative Assembly passed a resolution asserting
that the country was "greatly beholden to him for his steady
adhesion to the principles" of responsible government. They further
decided to vote a solatium of £20,000 to Lady Darling by way of
compensation to the Governor for his forfeiture of the pension
which he would lose by his recall. Sir Charles Darling declined to
permit any member of his family to receive a gift pending the
signification of the Queen's pleasure. In the meantime, on May 5th,
1866, Sir Charles Darling left Victoria, a demonstration of his
sympathisers being made on his departure. A vast crowd turned out
to bid him farewell with every mark of respectful regret. On his
arrival in England, Lord Carnarvon, who had replaced Mr. Cardwell,
declined to allow him to accept the proffered gift, intimating that
if he did so, he must not look for anything further at the hands of
her Majesty's Government. Sir Charles took the hint, and resigned,
and a series of rejections and "tacks" now ensued on the proposed
vote of £20,000 more insurmountable and irritating, if possible,
than those which had arisen in reference to the tariff. Later on
Sir Charles Darling made his peace with the Colonial Office, and
withdrew his resignation, withdrawing also his acceptance of the
much-debated gift The cause of contention between the Houses was
thus removed, and almost immediately after came the news of Sir
Charles Darling's death, whereupon the grant was "untacked," and an
annuity for life of £1,000 a year conferred on Lady Darling,
together with a lump sum of £5,000 for the education of her
children. Sir Charles Darling, who was created K.C.B. in 1865, died
at Cheltenham on Jan. 25th, 1870. He was thrice married, his third
wife, who is still in receipt of the £1,000 a year pension from
Victoria, being Elizabeth Isabella Caroline, the only daughter of

in 1851.</p>

<p><a name="A346" id="A346"></a><b>Darling, Hon. John</b>, M.L.C.,
was member for West Adelaide in the Legislative Assembly of South
Australia in 1870-1 and 1875-6, and for Yatala in 1878-81; and was
Commissioner of Public Works in the Downer Ministry from June to
Oct 1885. In May 1888 he was elected to the Legislative
Council.</p>

<p><a name="A347" id="A347"></a><b>Darling, Lieut.-General Sir
Ralph</b>, G.C.B., seventh Governor of New South Wales, was the son
of Christopher Darling, who was promoted from Sergeant-Major to the
adjutancy of the 45th Foot in 1778, and was afterwards
Quarter-Master of that regiment. Sir Ralph, who was born in 1775,
was employed in the Custom House at Grenada. In May 1793 he was
appointed Ensign in the 45th Foot, and was engaged in suppressing
the negro insurrection in Grenada. In 1795 he became Lieutenant,
and was Adjutant of the 15th Foot at Martinique, where, in August
1796, he was appointed Military Secretary to Sir Ralph Abercromby.
After seeing a variety of service, he commanded a regiment at the
battle of Gorunna, and was Deputy-Adjutant-General in the Walcheren
expedition. He became brevet-Colonel in 1810, Major-General in
1813, and in 1815, when on the Horse Guards' staff, took the
extraordinary step of writing to the Duke of Wellington, asking for
a command in the army in Belgium. This elicited a characteristic
reply from the Duke. He commanded the troops in Mauritius from 1818
to 1823, and in May 1825 was gazetted Lieut.-General. In the same
year he was appointed to succeed Sir Thomas Brisbane as
Governor-in-Chief of New South Wales and its dependencies. He was
sworn in at Sydney on Dec. 19th, 1825. On his way out from England
he called at Van Diemen's Land, which until then had been a
dependency of New South Wales, and on Dec. 3rd proclaimed its
independence as a separate colony. His first task on his arrival in
Sydney was to re-organise the Civil Service, and he thus commenced
by creating ill-feeling and discontent. According to Blair, he was
precise and methodical, his habits being painfully careful, and
exhibiting that sort of diligence which takes infinite trouble and
anxiety over details to the neglect of larger and more important
matters. He had not been long in the colony before he embroiled
himself with the press, and became involved in mostly bootless
prosecutions for libel. The Joint Stock Company mania came on the
top of other troubles. A drought of three years ensued; a financial
crash followed, the value of cattle falling from pounds to
shillings. The Governor reduced the compulsory scale of rations
issued to assigned servants in consequence of the scarcity, and of
course became still more unpopular. The feeling against him was
intensified by his conduct towards Sudds and Thompson, two soldiers
who committed a theft in order, as they thought, to better their
condition, which they regarded as worse than that of convicts.
Darling subjected them to rigorous military punishment, and Sudds
died in confinement whilst cruelly fettered. These circumstances
produced immense excitement. Wentworth, the leader of the popular
party, drew up an impeachment, which he caused to be formally
delivered at Government House, and openly threatened never to lose
sight of so great a criminal until he had brought him to justice.
The case was repeatedly brought before the House of Commons; but it
was not until 1835, four years after Darling's return to England,
that a Committee of Inquiry was granted. When at length it was
obtained (Mr. Gladstone being one of the members), the evidence for
the prosecution fell through, and Darling was honourably acquitted.
He was knighted soon afterwards, and in England public sympathy was
entirely with him, though he was never again officially employed.
After a prolonged struggle with Darling's military despotism, the
colonists succeeded, in 1829, in securing the boon of trial by
jury. Previously, military juries were the only tribunals before
which all penal offences were tried. The Executive Council of New
South Wales was enlarged, under Darling's rule, into a Legislative
Council of fifteen members, but with secret proceedings. This body
it was that granted trial by jury. A period of extreme depression,
and almost universal bankruptcy, was succeeded by a period of
prosperity, and during the last three or four year of Darling's
rule the colony made rapid progress. The differences between the
Governor and the principal colonists became so acrimonious, that in
Dec 1827 he resigned his patronage of the Turf Club in consequence
of some speeches which were made at a dinner given by the Club. In
these, severe remarks were uttered in reference to the Governor's
administration; and to crown the insult, when the Governor's health
was drunk the musicians played the air, "Over the hills and far
away." Darling was recalled from his administration of the colony,
and embarked for England on Oct 21st, 1831, no demonstration,
either of regret or joy, being made at his departure. Darling did
not re-enter the Colonial service, but continued his military
career, and became successively Colonel of the 90th, 41st, and 49th
Regiments of Foot. He died at Brighton, England, on April 2nd,
1858. Sir Ralph Darling married Elizabeth, second daughter of
Colonel John Dumaresque, and sister of Lieut.-Colonel Henry
Dumaresque, Chief Commissioner of the Australian Agricultural
Company in New South Wales.</p>

<p><a name="A348" id="A348"></a><b>Darrel, George</b>, Australian
actor, dramatist and manager, began his professional career with
Simonson's Opera Company in New Zealand; but, on migrating to
Melbourne, took to the regular dramatic profession, earning some
distinction as a juvenile supporter of the once idolised Walter
Montgomery. He married Mrs. Robert Hair (<i>née</i> Fanny
Cathcart), the admirable <i>tragédienne</i>, and subsequently
visited professionally America and England, where, at the Grand
Theatre, Islington, he produced his play <i>The Sunny South</i>.
Mr. Darrel is the author of a number of Australian melodramas,
including <i>The Struggle for Freedom, Transported for Life, Book
from the Grave, The Forlorn Hope, The Sunny South, The Squatter,
The Soggarth</i>, etc., and at least half a dozen dramatisations of
popular novels. Mr. Darrel's first wife died some years ago at
Melbourne, where she was held in great esteem; and he has since
married a young actress belonging to one of his New Zealand
companies, who has appeared in many of his more recent
productions.</p>

<p><a name="A349" id="A349"></a><b>Darvall, Hon. Sir John

Darvall of the 9th Dragoons, and was born at Nunnington Hall,
Yorkshire, and educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge,
where he graduated in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of M.A.
in 1837. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1838, and
a year later went to New South Wales, where he practised at the bar
till 1867, being made Q.C. in 1853. He was appointed a nominee
member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales in 1844, and
in 1848 was elected for Bathurst. He joined in the opposition to
the measure conferring responsible government on New South Wales,
owing to disapproval of Wentworth's scheme for a non-elective Upper
House. In 1861 he was appointed a life member of the Legislative
Council, but resigned his seat, and subsequently represented the
electoral districts of West Maitland and Sydney in the Legislative
Assembly. In April 1856 he was appointed a member of the Executive
Council as one of the first responsible ministry, but did not
assume office as Solicitor-General till the following June, and
resigned with his colleagues in August. He was Solicitor-General in
the Parker Ministry from Oct. 1856 to May 1857, and
Attorney-General from May to Sept. 1857. He held the same post
under Mr. (afterwards Sir) Charles Cowper from August to Oct. 1863,
and from Feb. to June 1865. In 1850 Sir John Darvall was appointed
a member of the first Senate of the University of Sydney, and in
the next year refused a judgeship in Victoria. He was a strenuous
opponent of the separation of Queensland from New South Wales in
1859-60. In 1867 he returned to England, and was created C.M.G. in
1869 and K.C.M.G. in 1877. He died in London on Dec. 28th,

born at Shirburn, Oxfordshire, on March 5th, 1818, and came to
South Australia in 1842, whither his elder brother, George Francis
Davenport, had preceded him. He was appointed one of the four
nominee members of the Legislative Council on May 5th, 1846, and
was a nominated non-official member of the enlarged Legislative
Council when the Constitution Act was passed (Jan. 2nd, 1856), but
resigned on August 19th, 1856. He was an elected member of the new
Council from March 9th, 1857, to August 30th, 1866, when he
resigned. Sir Samuel was Commissioner of Public Works in the first
ministry formed after the concession of responsible government, and
acted as its representative in the Legislative Council from March
20th, 1857, to August 21st in the same year. He resumed office as
Commissioner of Public Works in Mr. (afterwards Sir) R. Torrens'
Ministry, Sept. 1st to Sept. 30th, 1857. He was Executive
Commissioner for South Australia at the International Exhibitions
held in London in 1851, Philadelphia in 1876, Sydney in 1879,
Melbourne in 1880. He was knighted in 1884, and was President of
the South Australian Commission to the Colonial and Indian
Exhibition held at South Kensington in 1886. For his services at
the latter he was created K.C.M.G., and received the honorary
degree of LL.D. from Cambridge University. He was Executive
Commissioner and Trustee of the Adelaide Jubilee Exhibition in
1887, and a member of the South Australian Commission for the
Melbourne Centennial Exhibition in 1888. He married, on June 1st,
1842, Margaret Frazer, only daughter of William Lennox Cleland,
barrister, Calcutta, and his wife Harriett Erekine Fullerton. Sir

invited to assume the pastorate of Chalmers Church, Adelaide.
Accepting the call, he arrived in South Australia in June 1870, and
was connected with Chalmers Church till 1877, when he associated
himself with the Adelaide Union College. When Sir W. W. Hughes
agreed to endow the Adelaide University with £20,000 for two
professorships, he stipulated that Mr. Davidson should fill the
first chair of English Language and Literature and Mental and Moral
Philosophy. Accordingly, when the University was constituted, in
1874, Mr. Davidson assumed the duties of the position. He died on
July 22nd, 1881, leaving a widow, the daughter of the late Hugh
Miller the famous Scotch geologist and writer. Mrs. Davidson, who

<p><a name="A358" id="A358"></a><b>Davis, James Davidson</b>, is
deserving of mention as the author of the first "Bibliography of
New Zealand" (Lyon &amp; Blair, Wellington, N.Z.). It is admirably
compiled and annotated, affording evidence of painstaking research
and scholarly tastes. Mr. Davis was a native of Hastings, England,
and emigrated for the benefit of his health. He obtained an
appointment on the staff of the Auckland <i>Star</i> and entered as
a student of the University College of that city. Consumption,
however, cut off a promising career in 1887. Mr. Davis was author

<p><a name="A359" id="A359"></a><b>Davy, Edward</b>, son of Thomas
Davy, a surgeon practising at Ottery St. Mary, Devonshire, and
Elizabeth (Boutflower) his wife, was born at Ottery on June 16th,
1806, and was brought up to the medical profession, becoming
M.R.C.S. in 1829. Having been deceived into buying a chemist's
business in the Strand, London, under the idea that he was
purchasing a medical practice, he made the best of his
disappointment, and traded as an operative chemist under the style
of "Davy &amp; Co.," dealing mostly in scientific apparatus of his
own invention, such as "Davy's blowpipe" and "improved mercurial
trough." He also patented "Davy's diamond cement," for mending
glass and china. In 1836 he published "An Experimental Guide to
Chemistry". He also commenced experiments in electric telegraphy,
which entitle him to be regarded as one of the pioneers of the
science, inventing the "relay," or, as he called it, the "electric
renewer." In 1836 he issued "Outline of a New Plan of Telegraphic
Communication." The next year he laid down a mile of copper wire
around the inner circle of Regent's Park, by means of which many
successful results were developed. In May of this year he opposed
the grant of a patent to his rivals, Cooke and Wheatstone, but
failed in the attempt. In 1837, too, a working model of his
improved apparatus was shown at the Belgrave Institution and at
Exeter Hall, where his invention of the needle telegraph excited
much attention. In 1838, despite much opposition, he succeeded in
patenting his "electro-chemical recording telegraph." Fortune and
fame seemed now to await him, but he chose this very juncture to go
to Australia as medical superintendent of an emigrant ship, sailing
on April 15th, 1839. During his absence his schemes collapsed, and
his invention being bought up by the old Electric Telegraph
Company, was quietly allowed to drop. In Australia Mr. Davy started
farming and then turned to journalism, contributing to the
Melbourne <i>Argus</i> from 1843 to 1845, and was then engaged as
editor of the <i>Adelaide Examiner</i>. From 1848 to 1851 he
managed some smelting works at Yatala, in South Australia. He took
charge of the Government Assay Office in Adelaide in 1852, and was
then tempted away to Melbourne to take charge of a similar
establishment, where he was paid £1,500 a year. The latter
engagement only lasted from July 1853 to Dec. 1854, when the post
was abolished in a fit of Government economy. He again tried
farming, but could not make it pay. He then reverted to his
original calling, and practised as a surgeon at Malmesbury, in
Victoria. At the close of his career the Society of Telegraph
Engineers and Electricians made him an honorary member (Nov. 1884).
He died on Jan. 27th, 1885, at Malmesbury. Justice was done to him
in his lifetime by Mr. Fahie; and since his death his nephew, H.
Davy, M.D., has published a memoir of him.</p>

<p><a name="A363" id="A363"></a><b>Deakin, Hon. Alfred</b>, M.L.A.,
J.P., ex-Chief Secretary of Victoria, is the son of William Deakin,
a well-known coach proprietor in the early days of the colony, and
an emigrant from England, his mother being the daughter of a farmer
in Monmouthshire. He was born at Fitzroy, Melbourne, on August 3rd,
1856, and educated at the Church of England Grammar School, under
Dr. Bromby, and at the Melbourne University, but did not graduate.
He was called to the Victorian bar in 1877, and adopted the
profession of journalism, being connected with the editorial
department of the Melbourne <i>Age</i> and <i>Leader</i> from 1878.
He was elected to the Assembly for West Bourke in Feb. 1879, as a
supporter of the second Berry Ministry, defeating Mr. R. Harper by
fifty-six votes. There was one drawback to this gratifying success,
that at Newham, an inconsiderable polling place, a complete poll
was not taken. The result could not in any case have been altered,
as if all the votes bad gone to his adversary they would not have
exceeded at the outside thirty. Still, Mr. Deakin felt it a matter
of principle, as a Liberal, that a full ballot should be taken; and
so, after taking his seat and moving the address in reply to the
Vice-regal speech when the House met in July, he, without any
consultation with supporters or opponents, resigned his seat, much
to the chagrin of a good many of the former, who thought his
conduct Quixotic. At the election which ensued he again had Mr.
Harper as an opponent, and after one of the severest contests on
record was defeated by fifteen votes on a total poll of 4000. The
strain had been so severe that, in order to recruit his health, Mr.
Deakin went on a trip of some months to Fiji and the South Sea
Islands. On his return he recurred to politics, and at the general
election in Feb. 1880 again stood for West Bourke; but although he
polled a larger vote he was thirteen behind Messrs. Harper and
Stoughton. Five months later, Mr. Service, who had succeeded Mr.
Berry, was beaten on his Reform Bill, and appealed to the country,
when Mr. Deakin once more wooed the suffrages of West Bourke; this
being the fourth time within eighteen months. On this occasion he
was returned at the head of the poll along with Sir Bryan
O'Loghlen, and continued to represent the district until 1889, when
he was returned for Essendon and Flemington. Mr. Deakin married
Pattie, eldest daughter of Hugh Junor Browne of Melbourne, on April
3rd, 1882. He was Commissioner of Public Works from March 8th to
Nov. 13th, 1883; Commissioner of Water Supply from March 8th, 1883,
to Feb. 18th, 1886, and Solicitor-General from Nov. 13th, 1883, to
April 23rd, 1884, in the Service-Berry Coalition Government. In
1883 he carried an amending Water Conservation Act, which was the
first measure passed in Australia providing for public irrigation
on a large scale, and became President of the Royal Commission on
Irrigation and Water Supply. In the latter capacity be visited
America, with the view of investigating the various systems of
irrigation in force in that country, and on his return prepared a
report, of which 10,000 copies were, at the request of agricultural
societies, distributed throughout the colony, and the
recommendations of which have been endorsed by some of the highest
authorities in England and elsewhere. In the same year Mr. Deakin
became sponsor for another ameliorative measure, which, though
mainly based upon the provisions of the English Factory Acts, is in
some respects greatly ahead of them in providing for the effective
protection of women and children. Towards the end of 1885 the
Coalition Government was dissolved by the resignations of Messrs.
Service, Berry, and Kerferd. Mr. Deakin was then, by a unanimous
choice, elected to succeed Mr. (now Sir) Graham Berry, who went
home as Agent-General, in the leadership of the Liberal Party. In
this capacity he formed a junction with Mr. Gillies' following,
assuming (Feb. 18th, 1886) the post of Chief Secretary and
Commissioner of Water Supply in that gentleman's cabinet. The new
Government, in the absence of contentious topics, went to the
country on Mr. Deakin's irrigation policy, which was endorsed by a
decisive majority. In view of this result, Mr. Deakin, in June
1886, submitted to the Assembly a measure which, in addition to an
alteration of the law of riparian rights, provided for the carrying
out of a national system of irrigation, under which the Government
were to construct head works, the task of distribution being
allotted to the local bodies, who were ultimately to be reimbursed
by the private beneficiaries, and in their turn to reimburse the
central Government. The measure was adopted in its main features,
and a loan floated to effectuate its provisions, which have been
largely availed of in various parts of the colony. Perhaps the most
important outcome of the irrigation policy launched under Mr.
Deakin's auspices was the arrangement entered into with Messrs.
Chaffey Brothers for the sale to them of 250,000 acres on the
Murray frontage at Mildura for the formation of an irrigation
settlement. Mr. Deakin was senior delegate for Victoria to the
Colonial Conference held in London in 1887, and took a prominent
and successful part in its proceedings; he, however, declined the
honour of knighthood (K.C.M.G.) which was offered him during its
sittings. Mr. Deakin visited Egypt and Italy, and wrote a second
report on irrigation. He was Victorian delegate to the Chinese
Conference in 1888, member of the Federal Council, session 1889,
and was one of the two delegates of Victoria to the Federation
Conference in Melbourne in 1890; being also one of the seven
delegates of the colony to the Federation Convention of 1891. Mr.
Deakin was appointed First Minister of Health in 1890 and
Solicitor-General, taking the place of the Hon. H. J. Wrixon,
Attorney-General, during his absence in England in that year. Mr.
Deakin resigned office in Oct. 1890 along with the rest of his
colleagues, and was joint leader of the Opposition until the
dissolution in April 1892, prior to which he had intimated his
intention to take up an independent <i>rôle</i>, apart from any
party trammels. Mr. Deakin is now devoting the major part of his
attention to the practice of his profession, and was leading
counsel for the defence in the Deeming murder trial in April 1892.
He visited India to study its irrigation systems in 1891.</p>

<p><a name="A368" id="A368"></a><b>de Labilliere, Francis
Peter</b>, is of Huguenot origin, his family having occupied a
prominent position amongst the nobility of Languedoc as far back as
the thirteenth century. Capt. Peter de Labilliere, who was
naturalised by Act of Parliament in 1701, served under William III.
in Ireland and the Netherlands, and in the British army in Spain.
His grandson, Peter de Labilliere, emigrated to Port Phillip in
1839, taking with him his son, Charles Edgar, the father of the
subject of the present notice, by his marriage with Miss Hannah
Balle, which was solemnised at St. Mark's, Dublin, July 4th, 1839.
They made the voyage by the <i>Westminster</i>, the second ship
which sailed from England direct for Port Phillip, and landed in
Melbourne in Dec. 1839. Mr. Charles Edgar de Labilliere engaged in
pastoral pursuits at Tallook Yale, near Bacchus Marsh, and died in
London on Nov. 2nd, 1870. The subject of this notice, who was his
only son, was born in Melbourne on August 13th, 1840, went to
England with his father in 1859; entered at the Middle Temple on
Nov. 7th, 1860; called to the bar on June 6th, 1863; married at St.
Saviour's, Paddington, on Oct. 9th, 1867, Adelaide, eldest daughter
of the late Rev. Edward Ravenshaw, rector of West Rington, Wilts.
He has always taken a deep interest in the relations of the mother
country and the colonies, and was one of the very earliest
advocates of Imperial Federation, developing his views on the
question in a succession of papers, the first at the Social Science
Congress at Bristol, in 1869, on "The Future Relations of England
and her Colonies"; the second at the Colonial Conference,
Westminster Palace Hotel, in 1871, of which he was hon. secretary,
on "Imperial and Colonial Federalism"; the two next before the
Royal Colonial Institute, in 1875 on "The Permanent Unity of the
Empire"; and in 1881 on "The Political Organisation of the Empire."
He again opened the question before the Social Science Congress at
Birmingham, in 1884, and before the conference arranged by the
Royal Colonial Institute at the Colonial Exhibition of 1886. He
also combated the views of Mr. Goldwin Smith and other advocates of
disintegration, in an article on "The Contraction of England, and
its Advocates," in the <i>National Review</i>, in 1884. In that
year also, on his suggestion, the first steps were taken to found
the Imperial Federation League, he being hon. secretary to the
provisional committee, and afterwards, jointly with Mr. Arnold
Forster, to the League, on its establishment. From 1874 to 1881, as
a member of the council of the Royal Colonial Institute, he
assisted Sir Fred. Young in the honorary secretarial work of the
society before it was in a position to maintain a paid staff. As
appears by the correspondence laid before Parliament in 1876, he
was the first to suggest the annexation of Eastern New Guinea, in a
long letter addressed in 1874 to the Secretary of State for the
Colonies, a copy of which was sent, with a covering despatch, by
the late Earl of Carnarvon to each of the governors of the
Australian colonies. In 1878 his "Early History of the Colony of
Victoria" appeared, in two volumes. It corrected the previously
received date of the discovery of Port Phillip Bay, and brought to
light many facts and documents which had been forgotten, or never
before made public. Mr. de Labilliere resides at Harrow.</p>

<p><a name="A369" id="A369"></a><b>Deniehy, Daniel Henry</b>, a
brilliant but eccentric <i>littérateur</i> and publicist, was the
son of Daniel Henry Deniehy, and was born in Kent Street, Sydney,
N.S.W., in 1828. Having been educated at a private school and at
the old Sydney College, he continued his reading in French and
Italian literature. In his fifteenth year his parents took him to
England with the intention of placing him at college at Oxford; but
his age and diminutive appearance prevented his immediate
reception, and he was left in charge of a tutor, with whom he read
classics for some months. Weary of his isolation, he visited his
relatives in Ireland, and became acquainted with some of the
leading members of the Young Ireland party, in whose enthusiasm he
participated. On his return to Sydney he became articled clerk to
Mr. N. D. Stenhouse, a man of great literary acquirements and
generosity of disposition. During the time of his clerkship Deniehy
contributed sketches, verses, and criticisms to various newspapers,
all of which were received with favour on account of their
freshness and vigour of style. At this period he was an unwearied
student of the best authors both English and foreign, and in 1853
he delivered a series of lectures on modern literature at the
Sydney School of Arts. He also met with popular acceptance as a
speaker on the great political topic of the day, the Constitution
Bill. In 1856 he was returned to the Legislative Assembly of New
South Wales for Argyle, and soon gained a reputation for debating
power. He was returned by the electors of East Macquarie in 1858,
and kept his seat till after the passing of the Reform Bill in the
following year, when he voluntarily withdrew from public life.
During his Parliamentary career he invariably took the Liberal
side, and was one of the authors of the selection clauses of the
Robertson Land Bill, which is regarded as the Magna Charta of
agricultural settlement in New South Wales. Meantime he practised
at Goulburn as an attorney, but the time he devoted to his
Parliamentary duties seriously interfered with his business. In
1858 he returned to Sydney and devoted himself to literature,
contributing essays, critical and aesthetical, to the newspapers.
In 1860 he became one of the founders of the <i>Southern Cross</i>,
to which he contributed brilliant papers on some of the most
distinguished writers of the century. On the invitation of Sir
Charles Gavan Duffy and others in Victoria, he went in 1862 to
Melbourne, where for nearly two years he edited the
<i>Victorian</i> newspaper, a Roman Catholic organ, which has been
asserted to be one of the most vigorously written political
journals ever published in Australia. It succumbed, however, to bad
management, and Deniehy returned to Sydney broken in health and
hopes. He contributed admirable critical essays to the <i>Sydney
Morning Herald</i> at this time (1864-65). In the latter year,
acting on the advice of his friends, he removed to Bathurst,
N.S.W., where he renewed the practice of his profession, but under
depressing circumstances. He died in the hospital of that city on
Oct. 22nd, 1865. Deniehy married in 1855 Adelaide Eliza, only
daughter of John Cassima Hoalls, of Kellsthorpe, Notts, England,
and grand-niece of Lord Gough. This lady, who survived him, was
disinherited by her father for what he regarded as an unsuitable
alliance, contracted without his consent. In 1884 the "Life and
Speeches of Deniehy" were edited by E. A. Martin and published by
George Robertson, of Melbourne and Sydney.</p>

<p><a name="A370" id="A370"></a><b>Denison, Major-General Sir
William Thomas</b>, R.E., K.C.B., successively Governor of Tasmania
and of New South Wales, was the son of John Denison (formerly
Wilkinson), of Ossington, Notts, who succeeded to the fortune made
by his uncles as manufacturers in Leeds, and was for nine years a
member of the House of Commons. Three of Sir William Denison's
brothers rose to eminence, viz., John Evelyn, who, after being
Speaker of the House of Commons, was created Viscount Ossington;
Edward, who became Bishop of Salisbury; and George Anthony, the
well-known Archdeacon of Taunton. Sir William, who was born in
1804, and was educated at Eton and Woolwich, entered the Royal
Engineers, of which he ultimately became colonel, in 1826. In Oct.
1846 he was appointed to succeed Sir J. Eardley Wilmot as Governor
of Van Diemen's Land, where he arrived in Jan. 1847. He entered on
his administration under many difficulties, the bequest of his
predecessor, and his reception by the colonists was not
enthusiastic. Sir William Denison had had much experience of public
works in England, and the object of Mr. Gladstone, the then
Colonial Secretary, in sending him to Van Diemen's Land was the
better disposal of the labour and the more effectual control of the
prisoners; and throughout his whole period of rule he held to his
instructions on these points as the sole obligation binding on him.
He attempted an amicable adjustment of the claims of the
Legislative Councillors, including both those appointed by his
predecessor, and also the "Patriotic Six" whom Sir J. Eardley
Wilmot had dismissed. Out of the whole body it was left to his
discretion to select six for his own council, which was then a
purely nominated body. The whole number of the existing councillors
were summoned to Government House to hear the English Minister's
decision, and were requested to decide among themselves who should
be the half-dozen to be retained. Mutual recriminations, however,
arose, and knotty points of law were raised; so that in the end Sir
William Denison adjourned the Council to await special instructions
from Downing Street or a royal warrant making a fresh and final
nomination. The latter was only despatched from England in July.
Thus during 1847 there was no Legislature sitting; but at length
the <i>Gazette</i> announced that the Queen had reinstated the
"Patriotic Six," which was regarded as a great popular triumph. Sir
William Denison's next trouble was a quarrel with the judges of the
Supreme Court respecting the differential duties on which a revenue
of £20,000 depended, and which the judges declared to be illegal
There was also a dispute over the "Dog Act," which they declared
void. The Governor, determined to resist their flat, removed a
judge (Montagu) against whom there were charges of personal
misconduct. The Governor also recommended the Chief Justice
(Pedder) to take leave of absence; but this he firmly refused to
do, and was strongly backed by public opinion in this course. The
next step of the Governor was to carry through the Council a Doubts
Bill which set aside the ruling of the judges, and bound them to
accept as law any ordinance which they did not declare to be
repugnant to the Constitution or British law within fourteen days.
For his conduct in these matters Sir William Denison was censured
by the Home Government; but the removal of Judge Montagu from the
Bench was confirmed. The struggle for constitutional government was
earnestly carried on for years by the colonists, and at length the
boon was gained and was cordially welcomed. It curtailed
considerably the power of the Governor. The great
anti-transportation struggle succeeded, and Denison took strongly
the side opposed to the popular sentiment of the Australian
colonies. This imprudent step involved him in years of trouble and
angry contention, in the course of which his reputation for justice
and fair dealing suffered severely. "His opposition to the colonial
will on the subject," says West, "his injustice to the judges, and
his sarcastic delineations of colonial character narrowed the
circle of his friends." In 1855, after the battle of the League had
been fought and won, Denison was transferred to New South Wales,
with the title of Governor-General of Australia. His rule in the
mother colony was free from any serious political complications,
and he personally promoted many public works of a useful character,
as indeed he had done in Tasmania. The fortifications of Sydney
were planned by him, and bear his name. He was appointed Governor
of Madras in 1861. On the death of Lord Elgin he acted as
Governor-General of India pending the arrival of Sir John
(afterwards Lord) Lawrence. In 1866, his term of rule having
expired, he retired into private life, and died in England on Jan.
19th, 1871. He gave to the world his experiences as a governor in
two volumes, bearing the title of "Varieties of Viceregal Life."
Sir William married in 1838 Caroline Lucy, daughter of the late
Admiral Sir Phipps Hornby, K.C.B. He was promoted to be
major-general, and was created K.C.B. in 1856. Despite the personal
opprobrium under which Sir William Denison laboured during the
major portion of his rule in Van Diemen's Land, the colonists on
his leaving presented him with £2000 for the purchase of plate,
which, after a long correspondence with Downing Street, the
Colonial Office authorities ultimately permitted him to accept,
contrary to the usual precedent. Sir William deserves credit for
the care which characterised his initiation of responsible
government in New South Wales and for the conscientiousness which
marked his nominations to the Upper Chamber when the bicameral
system was instituted. In 1857, when the administration of Norfolk
Island was vested in the Governor of New South Wales, he drew up an
excellent code of government for the descendants of the mutineers
of the <i>Bounty</i>. He also gave good advice to Governor Gore
Browne, of New Zealand, which, had it been followed, might have
prevented the war commenced at Waitara. Writing on the subject to
Sir Roderick Murchison in 1860, he gave it as his opinion that the
"treatment of the natives by the whites had been such as would
naturally induce the conduct which was designated rebellion," and
added, "To tell you the truth, I believe it was intended that such
should be the result." In New South Wales, even after the
inauguration of responsible government, he allowed himself no
inconsiderable discretion in dealing with the advice tendered to
him by his Ministers. In 1858 he would not allow the Upper House to
be "swamped". When urged by Mr. Cowper, as Mr. Rusden narrates, to
dissolve the Legislative Assembly in 1860 and to allow the public
payments to be met by payments unwarranted by law, he declared that
after a certain date he would sanction no disbursements
unauthorised by regular Appropriation Acts. When, after
correspondence about the issue of a Crown grant (promised long
before by a previous Governor), he received instructions to issue
it, and Mr. Cowper (then Colonial Secretary in the Robertson
Ministry) refused to affix the public seal, the resolute Governor
desired the Secretary to hand the seal to him, and with his own
hand sealed the grant The Ministry resigned in consequence, but
immediately reconstructed themselves under Cowper; and a vote of
censure on the Governor mooted in the Assembly after his departure
to Madras was shelved by the passing of the previous question. Sir
William Denison's "Varieties of Viceregal Life" was published in
London in 1870.</p>

near that city. He entered the army in 1845 as ensign in the 70th
Regiment, and served with distinction in India from 1846 to 1860,
when, having become successively captain and major of brigade on
the permanent staff of the Bengal Presidency, he was ordered with
his old regiment, which he had rejoined after serving with several
others, for active service in New Zealand. Colonel de Quincey
arrived in that colony in May 1861, served there for a time,
commanded the 1st Company Transport Corps, and then rejoined his
regiment; but seeing no prospect of returning to India without
sacrificing his position, sold out, and turned his attention to
farming, with the unsatisfactory results usually experienced by
military men. In 1863, the war breaking out, and the Auckland
Militia being called out for active service, he was appointed to
the command of the left wing of the 3rd Battalion Artillery, with a
captain's commission and without pay, and embodied it on those
terms. Major-General Galloway, under whom he had served in India,
on being appointed to the command of the colonial forces selected
Captain de Quincey as his military secretary, to which appointment
he was gazetted with the rank of major, and soon afterwards he was
gazetted to a lieutenant-colonelcy. On General Galloway leaving the
colony in 1864, he was succeeded in the command by Colonel
Haultain, Lieut.-Col. de Quincey continuing as military secretary.
Subsequent to the termination of the war in the Auckland province,

Jean</b>, F.R.G.S., son of Captain George de Winton, of Heywood
Hall, D.L. for Somerset, by Emma Juliana, daughter of the late
George Robinson, of Bath, and Rose Hill, Tonbridge, Kent, entered
the army in the year 1841, at the age of seventeen, as an ensign in
the 99th Regiment; and in 1843, with Lieutenant Elliot of the same
regiment, embarked for Hobart Town in the barque <i>Constant</i>,
in command of a convict guard. The surgeon superintendent was Dr.
Stephen Hampton, R.N., afterwards Governor of Western Australia.
Landing the prisoners at Hobart Town, the vessel proceeded to
Sydney, and the detachment joined the headquarters of the regiment
at Parramatta. After serving on detachment at Windsor, Newcastle,
and Port Macquarie, he was, on promotion, on the occasion of the
projection of a new penal settlement in North Australia, selected
to command a detachment embarked in the <i>Thomas Lowry</i>, the
civil staff and another detachment having before left in the ship
<i>Lord Auckland</i>. The <i>Lord Auckland</i> went ashore in Port
Curtis, her passengers encamped on Facing Island, and thus it came
about that Lieutenant de Winton was the first to land and encamp on
the mainland on the spot which is now Port Gladstone. On the first
night the natives, by a shower of spears, signified their
disapproval of the invasion of their territory. While taking
precautions for repelling attacks, Lieutenant de Winton would not
permit reprisals, being anxious to establish friendly relations
with the natives; and in this, after a time, he succeeded, though
on occasion at considerable personal risk. The Home Government,
yielding to the strong opposition of the colonists of New South
Wales to the formation of the projected penal settlement, it was
abandoned, and the expedition returned to Sydney. Lieutenant de
Winton was then sent in command of a detachment to Brisbane, being
at the same time nominated on the commission of the peace. Brisbane
was then little more than a collection of weatherboard huts, its
commerce represented by three or four general storekeepers, a
fortnightly steamer from Sydney, with an occasional small
sailing-vessel, sufficing to supply its wants and those of the
district. Its government was represented by the police magistrate,
Captain Wickham, R.N., who had been a brother officer of Darwin in
the <i>Beagle</i>, and the officer commanding the military
detachment. Visiting the settlers and squatters on the Logan and
the Darling Downs, Lieutenant de Winton was so impressed with the
capabilities of the country to support a large population, that he,
in letters to friends at home and to the London press, strongly
advocated emigration to Moreton Bay. One of the letters, drawing a
comparison between the wages of artificers and agricultural
labourers in the Moreton Bay district and those ruling at home, was
widely published, and drew the attention of many to the growing
importance of the rising colony. In 1848 the detachment was
withdrawn from Brisbane, and after a short period of service with
the headquarters in Sydney, Lieutenant de Winton proceeded with a
detachment of the regiment to Norfolk Island, remaining there for
eighteen months, returning to the island for another two years,
after an interval of service at Hobart Town. In 1853 Lieutenant de
Winton was invalided from the island, and granted two years' sick
leave. A sea voyage to England having much restored his health, he
applied for employment, and was selected to form a recruiting
subdivision at Preston. In 1854 Lieutenant de Winton was promoted,
and went to command the depôt of his regiment at Chatham, and
subsequently to command a detachment at Harwich. The Crimean war
being then raging, Captain de Winton volunteered for active
service, and was appointed Brigade-Major of the British Swiss
Legion. After the peace Major de Winton returned to England, and
shortly afterwards retired from the army. Major de Winton was one
of the secretaries to the National Society for Aid to Sick and
Wounded in War in 1870-71, was Deputy Foreign Commissioner of the
South Kensington Exhibitions in 1871-2, and was connected with
other exhibitions abroad. His name is not unknown in the literary
world, he having for some time edited <i>Colburn's United Service
Magazine</i>, and being still an occasional contributor to the
press. Major de Winton married at Brisbane, in 1848, a daughter of
Mr. Thomas White Melville Winder, of Windermere, Hunter River, New
South Wales.</p>

<p><a name="A379" id="A379"></a><b>Dibbs, Sir George Richard</b>,
K.C.M.G., M.L.A., Premier of New South Wales, is the son of the
late Captain John Dibbs of the East India Company's service, and
has represented the Murrumbidgee in the Legislative Assembly for
some years past. He was Colonial Treasurer in the Ministry of the
late Sir Alexander Stuart from Jan. 1883 to Oct. 1885, when he
succeeded that gentleman, and was Premier till December following.
From Feb. 1886 to Jan. 1887 he was Colonial Secretary in the
Jennings Ministry, and formed another short-lived Administration in
Jan. 1889, in which he was Premier and Colonial Secretary until
March in the same year. Mr. Dibbs is a strong Protectionist. He was
appointed one of the representatives of New South Wales to the
Federation Convention held in Sydney in March 1891, although
considerable objection was made to his appointment by Sir Henry
Parkes, on the ground that he had expressed himself opposed to
Federation under the Crown. In Oct. 1891, on the defeat of the
Parkes Ministry, Mr. Dibbs once more became Premier of the colony,
and succeeded in carrying a Protectionist tariff. In June 1892 he
visited England on an important financial mission, in which he
appeared as the representative not only of New South Wales, but of
Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. He was
created K.C.M.G. in July.</p>

<p><a name="A380" id="A380"></a><b>Dick, Hon. Thomas</b>, is a
native of Edinburgh, and was born there in 1823. Having gained
commercial experience in London, he left that city for St. Helena,
but after seven years' residence there resolved on removing to New
Zealand, arriving in Otago, accompanied by his wife and family, on
Nov. 26th, 1857. After some mercantile experience, Mr. Dick entered
the political arena. Mr. Harris having resigned his seat as a
member of the Provincial Council for Dunedin at the end of 1858,
Mr. Dick was unanimously elected to succeed him in Feb. 1859.
During the ensuing session of the Council an adverse vote caused
the Executive to resign office, and a new one was formed by Mr.
Reynolds, of which Mr. Dick was a member. A Bill having been passed
considerably increasing the number of members of the Council, early
in 1860 a general election took place, and Mr. Dick was returned at
the head of the poll for Dunedin, eleven candidates having been
proposed, five to be elected. On the assembling of the new Council
Mr. Dick occupied a seat on the Ministerial benches, which he,
however, quickly resigned. It was not till 1862 that he again held
an official position in the Council. At the opening of the session
that year he proposed an amendment on the address in reply,
carrying it by a small majority, and thereby relegating the
Cutten-Walker administration to the Opposition benches, when he
himself assumed office as Provincial Secretary. Another general
election took place in May, 1863, when Mr. Dick was again returned
at the top of the poll for Dunedin, retaining the position of
Secretary at the opening of the new Council. He was however,
shortly compelled to resign, but was again reinstated for a few
months. He succeeded Mr. Harris as superintendent of the Otago
province, in August 1865, but was displaced by Mr. Macandrew in
Feb. 1867, when his first term expired. Mr. Dick sat in the New
Zealand House of Representatives in 1861 and 1862, but he was not a
member of Parliament in 1863-4 and 5. In 1866 he was elected for
Port Chalmers. After the first session he resigned his seat, and it
was not till 1879, on the general election for the seventh
Parliament of New Zealand, that he again appeared on the scene as a
Dunedin representative, in conjunction with Messrs. Oliver and
Stewart. The result of the election of 1879 placing the Hall
Ministry in power, Mr. Dick joined the administration in 1880,
holding the portfolios of Colonial Secretary, Minister for
Education, and Minister for Justice. Sir John Hall having resigned
on account of ill-health in 1882, Sir F. Whittaker became the
Premier, Mr. Dick occupying his old position, with the added
responsibilities of Postmaster-General and Commissioner of
Telegraphs. In 1883 Sir F. Whittaker retired, being followed by
Major Atkinson as Premier, but the Government continued, with one
or two alterations, the same as that formed by Sir John Hall in
1879. Mr. Dick consequently remained in office, confined, however,
on this occasion to the responsibilities of Colonial Secretary and
Minister for Education. A dissolution by effluxion of time
occurring at the close of this session, and a rearrangement of
electorates having been decided on, Mr. Dick offered himself as a
candidate for the new district of Dunedin West, having for his
opponent his old colleague in the united electorate, Mr. W. D.
Stewart, who after a severe contest won the seat by a small
majority. At the general election in 1887, the contest for the
representation of the district between the two gentlemen was
renewed, ending with a similar result; so that Mr. Dick has since
been excluded from public life.</p>

<p><a name="A390" id="A390"></a><b>Dodds, Hon. John Stokell</b>,
C.M.G., Puisne Judge, Tasmania, was born in Durham, England, in
1848, and having emigrated to Tasmania, was admitted to the bar
there in 1872. Having unsuccessfully contested South and North
Hobart, Mr. Dodds succeeded Mr. Fysh as the representative of East
Hobart in, 1878, and held the seat till 1887, when he assumed his
present judicial position. Immediately after his election he
accepted the post of Attorney-General in the Crowther
Administration, which took office in Dec. 1878. On their defeat in
Oct. 1879, Mr. Giblin undertook the formation of a Coalition
Government, Mr. Dodds and Mr. O'Reilly being selected as
representatives of their party. The office of Treasurer was offered
to and declined by Mr. Dodds, who was unwilling to take any
portfolio other than that of Attorney-General. Mr. Giblin then
waived his own personal wishes, and consented to Mr. Dodds
retaining the Attorney-Generalship, he taking the Treasury.
Ultimately, however, Mr. Dodds changed places with him, and held
the office of Treasurer until the Coalition Government oeased to
exist on Mr. Giblin resigning, in August 1884, to become a Judge of
the Supreme Court. The Administration was then reconstructed, and
Mr. Dodds resigned the Treasurership and became Attorney-General
again. In 1886, when Mr. Douglas proceeded to England as
Agent-General, it was thought that Mr. Dodds would become Premier;
but the Governor, Sir George Strahan, was advised by Mr. Dodds to
send for Dr. Agnew^who assumed that position. But the real work of
guiding the administration, and of leading the House of Assembly,
fell upon Mr. Dodds, who safely steered his party through a general
election and a stormy session of Parliament. When still
Attorney-General, and whilst en route to England to represent the
colony at the Colonial Conference held in London in 1887, he was
appointed to the senior puisne judgeship, rendered vacant by the
death of his old chief, Mr. Giblin. After attending the Conference,
Mr. Dodds returned to Tasmania to assume the seat upon the bench to
which he had been appointed in the previous February. In 1890,
during the absence of Governor Hamilton, Mr. Dodds exercised for a
short time the functions of Deputy Governor.</p>

matriculated in 1829, but left the University without graduating.
He then spent a couple of years in America and travelled
extensively on the Continent, occupying his time in literary
pursuits, and contributing verse to the magazines. He entered at
the Middle Temple, Nov. 7th, 1835, and was called to the bar Nov.
19th, 1841. In May of the following year he went out to New
Zealand, and settled in the Nelson district, becoming, in 1848,
Colonial Secretary for the province of New Munster. In 1851 he was
made Civil Secretary for the whole of New Zealand, but resigning
the conjoint offices in 1853, he became Commissioner of Crown Lands
and Resident Magistrate of Hawke's Bay. He was elected to a seat in
the House of Representatives for Nelson in 1855, and was re-elected
in 1860. On August 6th, 1862, Mr. Domett became Premier in
succession to Mr. (afterwards Sir) William Fox. It was then the eve
of the Waikato war, and the difficulties encountered in the House
led to his resignation on Oct. 29th, 1863, when the Whitaker-Fox
Ministry (commonly regarded as the "War Ministry") came into
office. Mr. Domett was then appointed Secretary for Crown Lands,
and was allotted a seat in the Legislative Council, afterwards
becoming Commissioner of Old Land Claims. He was appointed
Registrar-General of Land in 1865, and in 1870 Commissioner for
Confiscated Lands. In 1871 he retired from his offices, and
returned to England, where he lived till his death, which took
place in London on Nov. 2nd, 1887. In 1880 he was created C.M.G.
Mr. Domett was the author of several volumes of poetry, and enjoyed
the friendship of Browning. He it is who was referred to by the
latter in his poem beginning, "What's become of Waring, Since he
gave us all the slip." Mr. Domett published "Venice: a poem," 1839;
"Narrative of the Wairau Massacre," 1843; "Ordinances of New
Zealand, Classified," 1850; "Ranolf and Amohia; a South Sea Day
Dream," 1872, being an epic poem on a Maori subject; "Flotsam and
Jetsam: Rhymes Old and New," 1877. Mr. Domett was for some years a

became a clerk in the firm of Dawes &amp; Co., of which he was
afterwards the head. In Sept. 1851 he fought a duel with Sir Thomas
Mitchell, Surveyor-General of New South Wales (<i>q.v.</i>). He was
elected to the Assembly for Cumberland in 1856, and formed the
first Constitutional Ministry in New South Wales in June 1856, but
resigned his position as Premier and Chief Secretary in August in
consequence of a vote of want of confidence. He accepted office
again as Colonial Treasurer under Mr. (afterwards Sir Henry Watson)
Parker in Oct. 1856, but on seeking re-election he was defeated for
Sydney Hamlets. However, the member for South Cumberland retired to
make way for him, and he was elected on Nov. 4th, but retired with
his colleagues in Sept. 1857, after their defeat on the Electoral
Bill. In 1860 he was knighted, and left the colony, which he twice
revisited. Sir Stuart married in Feb. 1854, Amelia, seventh
daughter of Frederick Cowper, of Carlton Hall and Unthank,
Cumberland (who survived him), and died at Carlton Hall on Jan.

<p><a name="A396" id="A396"></a><b>Douglas, Hon. Adye</b>, M.L.C.,
is of Scotch descent. His grandfather, a naval officer of
distinction, was Port Admiral at Yarmouth, and subsequently at
Chatham. Mr. Douglas's father was an officer in the British army,
and married a Norfolk lady, the late Agent-General for Tasmania
being born at Thorpe, near Norwich, on May 30th, 1815. Sprung of a
naval stock, five of his uncles being post captains in the royal
navy, Mr. Douglas was intended for the sea, but entered the legal
profession, and was articled to a firm of solicitors at
Southampton, where, when admitted, he himself subsequently
practised. When only twenty-three, however, Mr. Douglas emigrated
to Tasmania, then and until 1857 known as Van Diemen's Land.
Arriving in the colony early in 1839, he was admitted to the local
bar, but having a few months later visited Victoria (then the Port
Phillip district of N.S.W.), Mr. Douglas decided to embrace
pastoral pursuits in the young settlement. Taking a number of sheep
with him he settled near the Saltwater ranges; close to what is now
the flourishing town of Kilmore, but ultimately abandoned squatting
and returned to Tasmania. In 1842 Mr. Douglas re-commenced the
practice of the law at Launceston, and quickly achieved a leading
position. He also turned his attention to public affairs, becoming
a prominent member of the Anti-Transportation Association, and in
1856 member for Launceston in the old Legislative Council. In that
capacity he assisted materially in the formation of the new
constitution of Tasmania, his efforts being mainly devoted to
liberalising its basis. Mr. Douglas revisited England in 1857, and
made a tour of the country in company with his friend, Sir Richard
Dry. He was so much impressed with the advantages secured by what
he saw of the extension of the railway system that on his return to
Tasmania, where he was elected to the Assembly for Westbury in
1862, he vigorously championed the advent of the iron horse into
his adopted country; being the foremost, in spite of strenuous
opposition, in securing the formation of the first Tasmanian
railway, from Launceston to Deloraine, the first sod of which was
turned by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1868. In August 1884 Mr. Douglas
somewhat reluctantly became Premier and Chief Secretary of the
colony, and resigning his seat in the Lower House, was elected to
the Legislative Council for South Esk. Mr. Douglas represented his
colony at the Sydney Convention, and was responsible for the policy
which led to the inclusion of Tasmania in the Federal Council of
Australasia. The official representation of Tasmania in London
having, after a good deal of irresolution, been decided on, Mr.
Douglas resigned the Premiership in March 1880, and became the
first Agent-General of the colony. At the London Colonial
Conference of 1887 Mr. Douglas was associated with the present
Judge Dodds in the representation of the colony. At the close of
the year Mr. Douglas resigned his position in London and returned
to Tasmania. In July 1800 he was elected a member of the
Legislative Council for Launceston. He was one of the delegates of
Tasmania to the Sydney Federation Convention in March 1891.</p>

son of Henry Alexander Douglas and Elizabeth (Dalziel) his wife,
was born in London on March 6th, 1828, and after receiving his
education at Rugby School and Durham University, he emigrated to
New South Wales in 1851, and received the appointment of a
goldfields' commissioner, a post he gave up in order to follow
pastoral pursuits. He sat as member for Darling Downs, and
afterwards for Camden, in the New South Wales Parliament; but in
1863 he settled in Queensland, and entered the Legislative Assembly
for Port Curtis. Mr. Douglas joined the Macalister Ministry in Feb.
1866, and was Postmaster-General from March to July of that year.
He was called to the Legislative Council in the same year; but
when, some months after Mr. Macalister's return to power, he was
appointed Treasurer, he re-entered the Assembly as member for the
Eastern Downs, afterwards resigning to take the leadership in the
Council. He resigned the treasurership in May 1867, and was
Secretary for Public Works till the August following. In the Lilley
Ministry Mr. Douglas was Postmaster-General from Dec. 1868 to Nov.
1869, when he resigned on accepting the post of Agent-General,
which he held till 1871, when he returned to Queensland, and was
elected in 1875 for Maryborough. In June of the following year he
accepted office as Secretary for Public Lands in the Thorn
Ministry, and became Premier upon the resignation of Mr. Thorn in
March 1877. In the following year he exchanged the portfolio of
Lands for the Colonial Secretaryship, and remained in power until
Jan. 1879, when his Government was defeated, and he resigned.
Subsequent to the assumption of a protectorate over a portion of
New Guinea by the British Government, he was a candidate for the
poet of High Commissioner, but Sir Peter Scratchley's claims were
preferred by the Imperial authorities. Mr. Douglas became Resident
at Thursday Island in April 1885, and on the death of Sir Peter
Scratchley he was appointed Special Commissioner for British New
Guinea, which post he held for nearly three years, until the
sovereignty of England was proclaimed. In 1889 he returned to
Thursday Island, where he acts as Government Resident and police
magistrate.</p>

<p><a name="A398" id="A398"></a><b>Dow, Hon. John Lamont</b>,
M.L.A., ex-Minister of Lands and Agriculture, Victoria, son of the
late David Hill Dow, was born at Kilmarnock, Ayr, Scotland, on Dec.
8th, 1837. He came to Victoria with his father and the other
members of his family, landing at Geelong in 1848. Mr. Dow having
learnt farming in the Barrabool district, took up pastoral country,
in 1861, at the Gulf of Carpentaria, in Northern Queensland, and
had a chequered experience, through the depression in wool and the
unhealthiness of the climate. In 1867 he returned to Victoria, and,
having adopted journalism, became agricultural editor of the
<i>Leader</i>, the weekly journal published by the <i>Age</i>
proprietary. Having had intimate opportunities of studying the
anomalies of the land question, Mr. Dow lectured on the subject
throughout Victoria, and the agitation which he initiated had very
much to do with the subsequent imposition of a land tax, with the
view of limiting the aggregation of large landed estates. In May
1877 Mr. Dow was returned to the Assembly as member for Kara Kara,
and has ever since enjoyed the confidence of the same constituency.
Having remained loyal to the democratic and protectionist policy
which he avowed on entering politics, Mr. Dow was included, as one
of the Liberal representatives, in the Coalition Government formed
by Messrs. Gillies and Deakin in Feb. 1886. He then resigned his
press appointments. Previous to this, in 1883, he visited America
as the special correspondent of the <i>Age</i> and <i>Leader</i>,
and embodied the result of his investigations into the agricultural
condition of the country in a series of letters, which were
ultimately republished in book form, under the title of "The
Australian in America." In 1885, having been appointed a member of
the Victorian Irrigation Commission, he accompanied the president,
Mr. Deakin, in his official mission to America to collect
statistics on the subject; and on this occasion contributed a
series of letters to the <i>Age</i> and <i>Leader</i>, which had
much to do with smoothing the path of the Coalition Government when
the results of Mr. Deakin's investigations were in the following
year embodied in practical legislation. Mr. Dow during his term of
office elevated the portfolio of agriculture to the position of an
independent department, establishing a scheme of technical
agricultural education by means of experts travelling through the
colony, forming also a Forest Department and sections dealing with
viticulture and pests inimical to vegetation, while a successful
export trade in dairy produce and fruit was initiated under his
administration. In the summer of 1890 Mr. Dow, as a director of the
Premier Permanent Building Society, became involved in the legal
proceedings taken against the officers of the institution after its
disastrous suspension of payment, and insisted, contrary to the
unanimous desire of his colleagues, who felt entire confidence in
his integrity, on resigning his position in the Cabinet pending the
result of the action taken. At the initiatory stage of the
proceedings the prosecution were compelled to admit that there was
no case against Mr. Dow, and to withdraw the indictment against
him. He was at once invited to resume office, and did so, resigning
with the rest of his colleagues in Nov. 1890. Mr. Dow married, in
1869, Marion Jane, second daughter of William A. Orr, of Toorak.
Mr. Dow's younger brother, Mr. T. K. Dow, is also an eminent
authority on agricultural matters.</p>

Rev. Henry Dowling, Baptist minister at Gloucester, England, in
which city Mr. Dowling was born in the year 1810, was educated at
the Free Grammar School, Colchester, and was afterwards apprenticed
to the printing business. In 1830 he emigrated to Tasmania, and was
for some time on the staff of the <i>Hobart Town Courier</i>, but
in the following year he purchased from the late Mr. J. P. Fawkner
the <i>Launceston Independent</i>, and changing its name to the
<i>Launceston Advertiser</i>, conducted it for some years with much
success. In 1839 Mr. Dowling proceeded to England, having received
the appointment of Immigration Agent for Tasmania, in which
capacity he was the means of introducing into the colony many
settlers whose names are now well known in Northern Tasmania. In
1842 he returned to Launceston, and was for some years engaged in
the printing and drapery business. He was one of the founders of
the Launceston Savings Bank, and in 1844 was appointed manager of
that institution. Mr. Dowling was always active in public affairs,
and was specially prominent in the anti-transportation movement,
and in the agitation for railways. He was Mayor of Launceston from
1857 to 1861, and in the latter year was elected to the House of
Assembly as Member for Launceston, but only held the seat for two
years. In 1868 he accepted the secretaryship of the Launceston and
Western Railway Company, and held that position until the year
1872, when this, the first of Tasmanian railways, was taken over by
the Government. Amongst the works issued from Mr. Dowling's press
may be mentioned an illustrated edition of the "Pickwick Papers"
and West's "History of Tasmania." He died at Launceston, Sept.
17th, 1885.</p>

in London</i>, and was the first to seize the miscreant Bellingham
after he had assassinated Mr. Spencer Perceval, the Prime Minister
of England, in the lobby of the House of Commons on May 11th, 1812.
Judge Dowling was born in London on Dec. 2nd, 1819, and was taken
to Australia by his father in 1828. Returning to London in 1836, he
entered at King's College, and graduated LL.B. in 1841. In Nov.
1836 he became a student at the Middle Temple, and was called to
the Bar in Nov. 1843. He was appointed Attorney-General at Port
Curtis in 1849, and subsequently went to Sydney, where he was
appointed a police magistrate in 1851, Crown Prosecutor in 1857,
and in 1861 District Court Judge, a position he still holds. Judge
Dowling married on June 20th, 1849, Katherine Marion, fourth

St Peter's College in that city. He was admitted to the South
Australian bar in 1868, and belongs to one of the most prominent
legal firms in the capital. Mr. Downer, who was made Q.C. in 1878,
entered the Assembly in the same year as member for Barossa, and
still represents that constituency. He was Attorney-General under
Mr. (now Sir) John Bray from June 1881 to June 1884. In this
capacity he introduced and carried through the House a measure to
allow persons charged with criminal offences to give evidence upon
oath, and a Married Woman's Property Bill. In 1883 he was one of
the representatives of South Australia at the Sydney Convention,
which gave birth to the abortive Federal Council of Australasia.
Mr. Downer took the leadership of the opposition during Mr. Bray's
absence in Europe in 1885; and having carried a motion of want of
confidence in the Cotton Ministry, assumed office in June 1885 as
Premier and Attorney-General. The accession of Mr. Bray, later in
the same year, strengthened the Ministry, which carried a tariff,
going a considerable way in a protective direction. In Jan. 1887
Mr. Downer left for England to attend the Colonial Conference as
one of the delegates of South Australia. He attended all the
sittings, and was entrusted by his Australian colleagues with the
duty of presenting the case for an assimilation of the law of
England with that of the colonies. in regard to marriage with a
deceased wife's sister. During his stay in England he was offered
and accepted the distinction of K.C.M.G. Sir John Downer only
returned to Adelaide to learn of the defeat of his Government, and

<p><a name="A411" id="A411"></a><b>Dry, Hon. Sir Richard</b>,
formerly Speaker and Premier of Tasmania, was the son of an
Irishman who was exiled to Van Diemen's Land in the early part of
the century in connection with the United Ireland troubles. He was
born at Elphin, near Launceston, Tasmania, on August 15th, 1815,
and at an early age succeeded to his father's estate at Quamby.
Having been appointed a member of the old Legislative Council, he
became the leader of the party which sought to compel the Imperial
Government to relieve the local Treasury of the expenses of the
police and gaol system rendered necessary by the existence of
convictism. This and the agitation for responsible government
brought the non-official members of the council into collision with
Governor Wilmot, who forced his financial measures through the
Council with a high hand. The dispute came to a head in 1845, and
after much unavailing opposition, Sir Richard Dry and five of his
colleagues in the first instance absented themselves from the
Legislative Council, so as to prevent the forming of a quorum, and
ultimately resigned their seats in that body. Henceforward they
were known as "the Patriotic Six," Sir Richard becoming the idol of
the hour, and securing a popularity which his exceptional qualities
enabled him to retain to the last hour of his life. In 1848 the
Patriotic Six were reappointed to the Council by the Queen's
mandate. As the first native politician to take the leading part in
championing the rights of his native land, Sir Richard Dry will
always be an interesting figure in Tasmanian history. When the
first instalment of representative institutions was granted, in
1851, he was elected to the new Legislative Council for Launceston,
and was chosen Speaker, a post which he retained till 1855, when he
retired from ill-health, the Council complimenting him by a request
that he should sit for his portrait to be placed on the walls of
the chamber in which he had played so high-minded a part. Sir
Richard subsequently visited England, and was knighted in 1858.
After his return to the colony he re- entered Parliament, and took
office as Premier and Colonial Secretary in Nov. 1866, his term of
power being ended by his death on August 1st, 1869. The "Dry
Scholarship" was founded in his honour in connection with the
Tasmanian Scholarships by public subscription. Sir Richard married
a daughter of George Meredith, of Cambria, Great Swan Port, who
still survives.</p>

in 1825, and educated at the Charterhouse, and at Exeter College,
Oxford, where he graduated B.A. (fourth class in classics and
mathematics) in 1847 and M.A. in 1864. Sir Charles represented

<p><a name="A414" id="A414"></a><b>Duffy, Hon. Sir Charles
Gavan</b>, K.C.M.G., sometime Premier of Victoria, was born in
Monaghan, Ireland, where his father was a farmer, in 1816. In his
twentieth year Mr. Duffy became sub-editor of the <i>Dublin Morning
Register</i>, and entered as a law student at King's Inn. In 1839
he became editor and proprietor of the <i>Belfast Vindicator</i>.
He returned to Dublin in 1842, and, in conjunction with John Dillon
and Thomas Davis, established the <i>Nation</i>. In 1844 Mr. Duffy
was tried and convicted of sedition along with O'Connell; the
conviction, however, was set aside on appeal by the House of Lords.
In 1846 O'Connell quarrelled with the Young Ireland party, of which
the <i>Nation</i> was the organ, and they established the Irish
Confederation, of which Mr. Duffy was one of the leaders. The
famine in Ireland in 1848 and the example of the Continental
revolutions of that period constrained Young Ireland to the
advocacy of extreme courses. An Act was passed to control the Irish
press, and under its provisions Mr. Duffy, John Martin, John
Mitchell, and Dr. O'Doherty, now of Queensland, were indicted for
treason felony. In Mr. Duffy's case, after he had been four times
successively arraigned, it was found impossible to procure a
conviction, the juries disagreeing at each trial. Subsequently, in
1852, he revived the <i>Nation</i>, which had been suppressed,
conducting it on constitutional and anti-physical force lines. He
also joined in starting the Tenant League, in which the Protestants
of Ulster co-operated with the Catholics of the south, and which
succeeded in sending fifty members to the Parliament elected in
1852. Amongst the latter was Mr. Duffy, who was returned for New
Ross, after a notable contest with Sir Thomas Redington,
Under-Secretary for Ireland in the Government that had prosecuted
him. He now worked in the House of Commons in association with
Frederic Lucas and George Henry Moore, the founder of the
independent Irish party in the House of Commons which sprang out of
the Tenant League. After four trying sessions, the defection of a
large section of that party induced him to resign his seat in
Parliament; and in Nov. 1855 he emigrated to Australia. Mr. Duffy
was received with extraordinary enthusiasm by his fellow-countrymen
at the Antipodes. At a banquet in Melbourne, presided over by his
subsequent opponent Mr. (afterwards Sir John) O'Shanassy, he made
his famous declaration that he was still an Irish rebel to the
backbone and spinal marrow. Mr. Lang, the veteran Sydney publicist,
pressed him warmly to take up his abode in New South Wales, but he
adhered to his decision in favour of Victoria, where property
valued at £5000 was purchased and presented to him by his admirers
in order to give him a qualification either for the Upper or Lower
House of the Legislature. So great was the popular enthusiasm that
the diggers at Ballarat pledged themselves to contribute an ounce
of gold apiece to the presentation fund. He was elected to the
first Parliament of Victoria for Villiers and Heytesbury, his
experience of the House of Commons enabling him to aid materially
in introducing the practice of that body into the new Assembly. In
the first session he was chairman of a select committee on a
federal union of the colonies, whose labours gave the original
impulse to Mr. Darcy M?Gee in Canada some years later in founding
the new Dominion; and he passed, against the determined resistance
of the Government, the first Act of Parliament of Victoria, being
one abolishing the property qualification for the popular branch of
the Legislature. In the same session (March, 1857) he became
Commissioner of Public Works and chairman of the Central Road Board
in the second responsible Government, Mr. (afterwards Sir John)
O'Shanassy being Chief Secretary and Premier. This administration
only lasted till April 29th, but in March 1858 Mr. O'Shanassy
resumed office, with Mr. Duffy as Minister of Lands. In about a
year a dispute arose with Mr. O'Shanassy and some of his colleagues
on the policy and management of the public estate, and Mr. Duffy
resigned office in March 1859. On the defeat of the O'Shanassy
Government in October of the same year, Mr. Nicholson, who
succeeded him, offered Mr. Duffy and any one political friend he
thought proper to select places in the new administration, but he
declined to accept these terms unless a majority of the Cabinet
were of his own way of thinking on the question of land law reform.
In 1860, on the defeat of the Nicholson Government, a new
administration was proposed by a coalition between Mr. Heales and
Mr. Verdon with Mr. Brooke and Mr. Aspinall, of which Mr. Duffy was
designed to be Premier; but as the Governor, Sir Henry Barkly,
refused to promise a dissolution in certain contingencies, Mr.
Duffy declined to proceed, and the former Government were recalled.
He returned to office, however, in Nov. 1861, as Minister of Lands
in a coalition Ministry of which Mr. O'Shanassy, Mr. Haines, and
Mr. Nicholson, each of whom had been Premier, were members, and
next year he passed the well-known Land Act of 1862. He wrote a
pamphlet illustrating the new Act, entitled "Guide to the Land
Law," of which three publishers issued separate editions in the
colony, and three others published separate editions in London. But
the industrious classes whom the new law was intended to benefit
hired themselves to the pastoral tenants to defeat it, and it was
widely evaded, with the result of still further assisting the
aggregation of large estates. On an attempt to amend the Act the
Government were defeated, and Sir James McCulloch came into office
in June 1863, but Mr. Duffy, though displaced, supported all the
land reforms proposed by the new administration. In 1864 he visited
Europe for two years, and on his return speedily re-entered
Parliament (in 1867) as member for Dalhousie. The Darling grant
controversy was then commencing, and he took at the hustings the
grounds which were finally adopted by nearly all parties&mdash;that
the grant ought never to have been made, but that having been made,
it ought to be sanctioned if sent in a separate Bill to the
Council, on which it had been attempted to be forced in the shape
of a tack to the Appropriation Bill. While a private member, Mr.
Duffy was chairman of a Royal Commission which brought up a report
that led to the experiment of payment of members being tried in
Victoria, and chairman of a Royal Commission on the subject of
federation of the Australian colonies, which recommended a
permissive Act (which would enable two or more of the colonies to
join together at their discretion), a principle which was applied
to the Cape of Good Hope and the South African colonies by the
Imperial Government. In 1869, the McCulloch Government having been
defeated on the motion of Mr. Robert Byrne, that gentleman invited
Mr. Duffy to become Premier and form the new administration; but
the state of parties at the moment made the time inopportune, and,
after a lengthy consultation with political associates, he declined
to proceed. In 1870 Mr. Duffy ventilated a project for the
neutralisation of the colonies in case of the mother country being
involved in war, but it met with no very definite encouragement
from any contemporary Australian statesman. In June of the next
year, on the defeat of the fourth McCulloch Government, Mr. Duffy
at length became Premier. During his administration the whole
country was for the first time thrown open for selection by the
abolition of the reserves made in favour of the pastoral tenants,
and the tariff was made more protective. In 1872 Mr. Duffy was
chairman of a conference of Cabinet Ministers from all the
Australian colonies to press on the Imperial Government the repeal
of the law limiting inter-colonial legislation on fiscal subjects,
an object which has since been effected in pursuance of that
remonstrance. After a year the Government were defeated by a narrow
majority nominally on an amendment moved by Mr. Ramsay, but really
in consequence of certain alleged abuses of patronage, including
the appointment of Mr. Cashel Hoey to the position of Secretary to
the Agent-General's office in London. Lord Canterbury having
refused him an appeal to the country, Mr. Duffy resigned in June
1872. A few months afterwards he was offered a companionship of St.
Michael and St. George, which he respectfully declined. In May 1873
he was knighted by patent, and in 1874 he made a second visit to
Europe, his eldest son being elected for Dalhousie in his father's
place. On his visit to Ireland he was invited to re-enter the House
of Commons, a county member making way for him; but he declined on
the ground that he disapproved of the programme which had been
substituted for the policy of the repeal party. On his return to
Australia in 1875 Sir Charles was elected for North Gippsland, one
of the largest constituencies in Victoria, without his presence at
the election being required. In returning thanks he stated the
remarkable fact that during the twenty-four years since he first
entered Parliament he had never lost an election. On the assembling
of Parliament in May, he was unanimously chosen Speaker of the
Legislative Assembly, and discharged the duties of the post till
Feb. 1880. In the meantime it was suggested that Sir Charles Duffy
should accompany the embassy to England on the subject of reform of
the Upper House in 1879. In the end, however, the project was
abandoned, as it met with little popular favour, and Messrs. Berry
and Pearson went alone. In 1880 Sir Charles Duffy, who had been
created K.C.M.G. in 1877, returned to Europe, and has since resided
in the south of France. He is in receipt of a pension of £1000 a
year from the colony of Victoria under an early act for the benefit
of ex-Ministers which was quickly repealed. It is understood that
Mr. Parnell was not favourable to the return of Sir Charles Duffy
to public life as a member of the House of Commons and of the Irish
Parliamentary party. It is to be doubted also whether Sir Charles
Duffy could have rendered that unquestioning obedience to his
leadership which he desired in his subordinate colleagues. Sir
Charles Duffy was chairman of the Trustees of the National Gallery
of Victoria, and took an active share in projects for encouraging
art, literature, and industrial enterprise in that colony. Since
his return to Europe in 1880, he has published "Young Ireland: a
Fragment of Irish History, 1840-50" (London, 1880); "Four Years of
Irish History, 1845-49" (London, 1883), being a sequel to "Young
Ireland": the "League of the North and South" (London, 1886), which
contains a trenchant refutation of John Mitchell's personal charges
against him; and written on colonial and Irish questions in the
<i>Contemporary Review</i>, <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, <i>National
Review</i>, <i>Freeman's Journal</i>, and other periodicals. Sir
Charles Duffy married first, in 1842, Emily, daughter of Francis
McLaughlin, of Belfast (who died in 1845); secondly, in 1846,
Susan, daughter of Philip Hughes, of Newry, who died in 1878; and
thirdly, in 1881, Louise, eldest daughter of George Hall, of
Rockferry, Cheshire, who died in 1890.</p>

took the Vice-Chancellor's prize for the best English essay at the
Melbourne University. He is in practice as a solicitor in
Melbourne, and has represented Dalhousie in the Legislative
Assembly since 1874. He is a moderate Liberal and Freetrader, and
was Minister of Agriculture in Mr. Service's first Government from
March to August 1880. He was Postmaster-General in the Munro
Government from Nov. 1890 to Feb. 1892, when he took office as
Attorney-General under Mr. Shiels. In April 1892, however, he
resigned with a view of becoming a candidate for the Speakership of

division, and was readmitted to the Shiels Cabinet as a Minister
without portfolio in May 1892.</p>

appointed a professor in the Seminary of St. Lawrence O'Toole, one
of the colleges of the Catholic University of Dublin. The President
of this Seminary, the late Bishop O'Quinn, was appointed, in 1859,
the first Bishop of Brisbane, and soon afterwards, in 1863, Dr.
Dunne went out to Queensland as a priest of the diocese of
Brisbane. He officiated in Brisbane until 1868, when he was
appointed parish priest of Toowoomba, which office he held until
1881, when he left on a visit to Europe. In 1869 he was created a
Doctor of Divinity by a brief of Rome. He returned from Europe at
the close of the year 1881, and found letters from Rome appointing
him Bishop of the Roman Catholic see of Brisbane, then vacant by
the death of Dr. O'Quinn. Dr. Dunne was consecrated Bishop of

C.M.G., F.R.G.S., sometime Agent-General for South Australia, was
the son of Henry Hampden Dutton, British consul at Cuxhaven, on the
Elbe, and was born at Cuxhaven in 1816, and educated at Hofwyl,
near Berne, Switzerland. From his seventeenth to his twenty-second
year he was employed as a mercantile clerk in Brazil and Rio
Janeiro. In 1839 he joined his elder brothers, William Pelham and
Frederick Hansborough, in New South Wales. The former temporarily
resided in Portland Bay, when engaged in sealing, from 1828 to
1838; and thus disputed with the Hentys the honour of having formed
the first permanent settlement in the Port Phillip district. The
other brother, Mr. F. H. Dutton, went largely into squatting
pursuits in South Australia, and died in London in 1890, possessed
of the famous Anlaby estate in that colony, and of personalty
amounting to several hundred thousand pounds. The subject of this
notice engaged in commercial pursuits in Victoria for two years;
and in 1841 settled in South Australia, where his brother Frederick
had preceded him. In 1843, when acting as overseer to the late
Captain Bagot, he discovered the Kapunda Copper Mine, and in 1845
visited England, when he sold his interest in the mine to the East
India firm of Cockerall, Larpert &amp; Co., who made arrangements
for working it. Mr. Dutton was a member of the mixed Legislative
Council from 1851 to 1857, and of the Legislative Assembly from
1857 to 1865. He was Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration in
the Hanson Ministry, from Sept. 1857 to June 1859, and in the
Ministry of which he himself was Premier in July 1863. He formed
his second Administration in March 1865, and remained in office
till the following September, when he became Agent-General for
South Australia in the United Kingdom. Mr. Dutton, who was an
Associate of the Institute of Civil Engineers, and was created
C.M.G. in Nov. 1872, died in London on Jan. 25th, 1877, whilst

Works in Mr. Forster's Ministry, from Oct. 1859 to March 1860.
After resigning his seat in the Council he was elected for West
Sydney in July 1863; and was Treasurer in Mr. (afterwards Sir)

sometime Auditor-General and Treasurer of Victoria, was born in
London in 1811, and when little more than twenty emigrated to New
South Wales, where he took up pastoral country on the Murray and
invested a large sum of money in stock and improvements. In 1836 he
decided to explore the Port Phillip district in search of suitable
sheep country. In the result he formed a station south of the
Goulburn, in what is now Victoria, and later on at Carlsruhe. He
formed the first crossing-place over the Murray at Albury, and the
nine thousand sheep which he sent to Carlsruhe from his New South
Wales station in March 1837 were the first sheep which came into
Victoria overland. In July 1843 Mr. Ebden was returned at the head
of the poll as one of the first four members sent by Port Phillip
to the New South Wales Legislative Council, which was then the sole
chamber, this election being the first for members of Parliament
which ever took place in Australia. Mr. Ebden sat in the New South
Wales Legislative Council for the full term of five years, but
declined to offer himself for re-election in 1848, on the ground
that the representation of Port Phillip at Sydney was a farce. Mr.
Ebden was an active worker for separation from New South Wales, and
having been in the meantime re-elected to the Legislative Council
of New South Wales, he seconded the address in reply to the
Governor's speech when, in March 1851, the Council was convened to
arrange the preliminaries for conferring a distinct constitution on
Victoria. After that was achieved later in the year, he was
appointed Auditor-General of Victoria by Governor Latrobe in July.
This post he held, together with a seat in the Legislative and
Executive Councils, till Oct. 1852, when he resigned, and was
succeeded by Mr. Childers, afterward Chancellor of the Exchequer of
the United Kingdom. Mr. Ebden then revisited England, but returned
to Victoria in 1855; and entering the Assembly, was Treasurer in
the second Haines Ministry from April 1857 to March 1858. Mr. Ebden

Ralph Brocklebank, of Childwall Hall, Lancashire. Sir Bevan, who
entered the army in Dec. 1852, as second lieutenant in the Royal
Engineers, and became lieutenant in Feb. 1854, was ordered to the
Crimea in the following year, and for his services in the
demolition of Sebastopol docks received the British and Turkish
medals. He served in India during the Mutiny, becoming captain in
April 1859. For services at the siege and capture of Chandairee and
Jhansi, the capture of Calpee, and actions at Betwa Koouch,
Gowlowlee, and before Gwalior, he was mentioned in despatches,
received the medal with clasp, and was appointed brevet-major in
1860. He served in China in 1864-5 with the late General Gordon,
and received a gold medal from the Imperial Chinese Government. Sir
Bevan became major in the Royal Engineers in 1872 brevet
lieut.-colonel in 1871, lieut.-colonel in the Royal Engineers,
brevet colonel and C.B. in 1877. He was employed in 1877, when war
was imminent with Russia, on a confidential mission to the east end
of the Mediterranean, on behalf of the War Office and Admiralty. In
1882 he was placed on half-pay, but was employed as colonel on the
staff commanding the Royal Engineers in the Northern district from
1884 to 1885 in February of which year he went in the same capacity
with the expeditionary force to the Soudan, where, for services at
the actions at Hasheen and Tamai he was mentioned in despatches and
received a medal with clasp. From 1885 to 1888 he was commandant of
the School of Military Engineering; and having been promoted to
major-general in 1887, commanded the troops in China from 1889 to
1890. It was whilst stationed at Hong Kong that General Edwards
received instructions to proceed to Australia and inspect the
military forces of the several Australian colonies. Arriving in
July 1889, he visited each colony, and recommended a general
federation of the local forces for defence purposes, his
suggestions forming the basis of Sir Henry Parkes' subsequent
action in favour of the political federation of the Australasian
group. In addition General Edwards furnished separate reports on
the defences of each colony and received the special thanks of the
Secretary of State for the Colonies for his valuable services.

law he gained a leading position in the profession, and was
appointed a judge of the native land court, with the position of a
puisne judge of the Supreme Court of New Zealand, in 1890 by the
Atkinson Government. When the Ballance Cabinet came into power in
1891, they disputed the appointment as <i>ultra vires</i>, but the
New Zealand Court of Appeal decided that the nomination was valid.
The case was carried to the Privy Council, and in May 1892 the
Judicial Committee gave a decision adverse to the legality of the
appointment, on the ground that Parliament had not previously been
asked to provide Judge Edwards's salary. Mr. Edwards married at

post he was permanently appointed in 1889, and holds it in
conjunction with that of Receiver-General and Commissioner of
Stamps. He is also a member of the Legislative Council.</p>

<p><a name="A436" id="A436"></a><b>Embling, Thomas</b>, M.R.C.S.,
L.S.A., is a native of Oxford, and was born in 1814. After
embracing the medical profession, and becoming M.R.C.S. England,
and L.S.A. London, he left for Australia in Oct. 1850, and after
spending "Black Thursday" in Adelaide, S.A., reached Melbourne in
Feb. 1851. Shortly after his arrival he was commissioned to
overhaul the management of the Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum; and
having done this successfully, commenced the practice of his
profession in Fitzroy, Melbourne, in 1853. In the following year he
took a prominent part in the agitation for the redress of the
gold-diggers' grievances, which culminated in the regrettable
outbreaks at Ballarat and elsewhere. In 1855 Dr. Embling entered
the Legislative Council as member for North Bourke, and represented
Collingwood in the Assembly from 1856 to 1869, when he retired from
political life. Dr. Embling aided in the start of the eight hours
movement, and endeavoured to pass the Torrens (Land Transfer) Act
through Parliament; but the measure was for the time rejected,
though subsequently adopted on the initiative of Mr. Service. Dr.
Embling was successful in obtaining a committee to inquire into the
industries of the colony, which reported in favour of Protection;
but it was several years before the present fiscal policy was
adopted. Dr. Embling has long since retired from the practice of
his profession.</p>

cadet in 1852, became sub-lieutenant in 1859, lieutenant in 1859,
commander in 1862, captain in 1868, rear-admiral in 1886, and
vice-admiral in 1891. In May 1880 he was appointed private
secretary to Lord Northbrook on the latter's becoming First Lord of
the Admiralty. He was commodore on the Australian station from June
1881 to 1884, and on Nov. 6th in the latter year hoisted the
British flag at Port Moresby, and proclaimed the British
protectorate over the south coast of New Guinea and the adjacent
islands. Admiral Erskine was naval aide-de-camp to the Queen from
Dec. 1882 to Jan. 1886, and was a Lord of the Admiralty from Feb.
to August 1886. From Dec. 1888 to Dec. 1891 he was senior officer
commanding on the coast of Ireland. In May 1892 Admiral Erskine
wrote to the <i>Times</i> expressing his doubts as to whether under
any circumstances the recruiting of Kanaka labour for the
Queensland sugar plantations could be conducted with freedom from
abuse and without depopulating the islands whence the supply was
drawn. He married in 1885 Margaret Eliza, daughter of Rev. John
Constable, of Marston Biggott, Somersetshire.</p>

<p><a name="A439" id="A439"></a><b>Evans, Hon. George Samuel</b>,
LL.D., one of the earliest English settlers in New Zealand and for
some time a Minister of the Crown in Victoria, was admitted to the
English Bar, and early became associated with the Wakefield
colonisation schemes. He decided to go out with the first party of
settlers to Wellington (Port Nicholson), N.Z., under the auspices
of Colonel William Wakefield, who had selected the site on Cook
Straits in the previous year. He sailed from London in the
<i>Adelaide</i> on Sept. 18th, 1839, and arrived at Port Nicholson
with his family early in 1840, another eminent jurist, the late Sir
Richard Davis Hanson (<i>q.v.</i>), who however, held a secondary
position to Dr. Evans, having previously landed from the
<i>Cuba</i>. Colonel Wakefield had selected Petone as the site of
the future capital of New Zealand, but there was a strong feeling
amongst the emigrants that the site of the present city of
Wellington was the preferable one. Colonel Wakefield was, however,
obstinate until the arrival of Dr. Evans, who called a public
meeting of the pioneer settlers, and used his oratorical powers
with such effect that the popular feeling aroused compelled Colonel
Wakefield to give way. Dr. Evans was thus in a sense the "father"
of Wellington (then called Thorndon). It must be borne in mind that
when the foundation of the Port Nicholson settlement was projected
in London England had not yet annexed New Zealand. A self-governing
constitution was therefore drawn up under date Sept. 14th, 1839,
which all the settlers were expected to sign. Under this
constitution a committee or council of colonists was appointed, of
which Colonel Wakefield was president, and Dr. Evans the next most
important member. Though only given the curious title of "umpire,"
the latter was virtually the chief judicial authority of the
settlement, both in civil and criminal cases. The first meeting of
the committee was held on March 2nd, 1840, and in the meantime
Captain Hobson had landed further north with a commission as first
Lieutenant-Governor. He was furious when he heard of the
proceedings at Port Nicholson, characterising the actions of the
council of colonists as high treason. He at once proclaimed the
Queen's sovereignty over both the North and South Islands, a
proceeding which might otherwise have been long delayed, and in hot
haste despatched the acting Colonial Secretary, Willoughby
Shortland, to Port Nicholson to dissolve the council, displace
their officers, and cancel their acts. Instead, however, of meeting
with opposition, Shortland was cordially welcomed by the supposed
rebellious settlers when he arrived at Port Nicholson on June 2nd,
1840. He was at once waited on by Dr. Evans and two others, who
assured him of the loyalty of the community. Two days later the
provisional government was declared illegal, and the Queen's
authority formally proclaimed. On July 1st following a great public
meeting was held, at which Dr. Evans moved the adoption of a loyal
address to Captain Hobson in a long speech, in which, whilst
vindicating the legality of the proceedings of the council, he
advised the settlers to sacrifice their feelings and submit to its
dissolution with a good grace. He strongly advocated the claims of
Wellington to be regarded as the seat of government, and the
address was then adopted. On August 19th Dr. Evans presided over
another meeting at which the reply of Governor Hobson to the
address was received. Subsequently the meeting deputed Dr. Evans,
Mr. Hanson, and Mr. Moreing to proceed to Sydney to lay before the
Governor of New South Wales (Sir George Gipps), who then had
superior jurisdiction over New Zealand, the views of the settlers
on the land question, a Bill being then before the Legislative
Council of New South Wales having for its object to cancel all
rights acquired of the Maoris except such as her Majesty might
allow. The Bill was passed, but it was really more particularly
aimed at the exorbitant claims of- New South Wales residents like
Mr. Wentworth, who professed to have acquired twenty million acres
from the Maoris, than at the requirements of genuine settlers such
as those at Port Nicholson. Dr. Evans and his colleagues were
therefore successful in their mission, a fact which they reported
to a public meeting on Dec. 11th. In the meantime the Government
did not give satisfaction, and in July 1841, when Governor Hobson
proposed revisiting Port Nicholson, Dr. Evans took an active part
in opposing the presentation of a congratulatory address to him
pending the disclosure of the Government policy on various matters
affecting the welfare of the settlers. He carried an amendment to
this effect, despite the support given to the motion for the
address by Mr. Hanson. On August 30th Dr. Evans was one of a
deputation which presented a petition to the Governor requesting
the immediate grant of a charter of incorporation to the town. In
1843 Dr. Evans took a prominent part in representing the views of
the settlers in relation to the melancholy Wairau massacre. He did
so as the champion of those whose injudicious conduct caused the
affray, and was sent as a delegate to Auckland to put their view of
the matter before the Governor. He was also hotly opposed to the
policy of Governor Fitzroy in cancelling the award of Mr. Spain
(<i>q.v.</i>) in relation to the Wellington land claims. Dr. Evans
was no believer in the treaty of Waitangi, that Magna Charta of the
Maoris, and when in England in 1845 acted as the representative of
the discontented colonists who demanded the recall of Fitzroy. On
this subject he had interviews with the Under-Secretary for the
Colonies (Mr. Hope), and corresponded with the late Lord Derby,
then, as Lord Stanley, head of the department. Dr. Evans
subsequently went to the colony of Victoria, and took a prominent
part in the discussion of the various questions which agitated the
early stages of its development under representative institutions.
When responsible government was conceded he was returned to the
first Legislative Assembly in 1856 for Richmond. He was
Postmaster-General in the second O'Shanassy Ministry throughout the
whole term of its existence, from March 1858 to Oct. 1859. When Sir
Charles Gavan Duffy left the Government in March 1859, Dr. Evans
took the additional portfolio of Minister of Lands, which he held
till the dissolution of the Cabinet. In the third O'Shanassy
Government Dr. Evans was Postmaster-General from Dec. 1861 to June
1863. He was for a considerable period editor of the <i>Melbourne
Herald</i>. Dr. Evans died on Sept. 23rd, 1868.</p>

Northamptonshire, was born in 1826, and educated at Lincoln
College, Oxford, where he matriculated in May 1845, and graduated
B.A. in 1849 and M.A. in 1852. He entered at the Inner Temple in
November of the latter year, and was called to the bar in Jan.
1864. His tastes tending in the direction of literature, he became
a writer for the <i>Spectator</i>, and having become acquainted
with Mr. Edward Wilson, one of the proprietors of the Melbourne
<i>Argus</i>, he was selected by that gentleman, when he came to
reside in England, to represent the Wilson interest in the
management of the <i>Argus</i>. Mr. Gowen Evans went to Melbourne
in that capacity in 1867, and has ever since taken a prominent part
in the direction of the paper. Mr. Evans was admitted to the
Victorian bar in 1867, and in the following year he received the
honorary degree of M.A. from Melbourne University.</p>

did not enter political life till 1868, when he was returned to the
Legislative Assembly for Encounter Bay, and subsequently sat in the
Legislative Council from 1873 to 1878. Mr. Everard was Commissioner
of Public Works in the Hart Ministry, from Sept. to Oct. 1868;
Commissioner of Crown Lands in the Blyth Ministry, from July 1873

<p><a name="A442" id="A442"></a><b>Eyre, Edward John</b>, son of
the late Rev. Anthony Eyre, vicar of Hornsea and Long Riston,
Yorks, was born on August 15th, 1815, and educated at Louth and
Sedbergh Grammar Schools. In 1833 he emigrated to Sydney, and
entered upon pastoral pursuits, with some success, in the Lower
Murray district, where he was subsequently appointed Resident
Magistrate and Protector of the Aborigines. Mr. Eyre early began to
interest himself in exploration, and in 1836 conducted an
expedition across the Australian continent from Sydney to Swan
River, W.A. He was afterwards a settler in South Australia, and in
1840 started on a journey for the South Australian Government into
the interior. His object was to explore Lake Torrens and penetrate
to the heart of the continent. After visiting Lake Torrens, he
struck into the Flinders Range; but, owing to the scarcity of food
and water, found himself unable to proceed northwards through the
impenetrable bush. At last he succeeded in rounding the Great
Bight, whence he pushed on to King George's Sound, in the company
of one Englishman (Baxter) and three aborigines. The party endured
great privations, and after two months of hardship two of the
natives murdered Baxter and decamped with the provisions. Mr. Eyre,
left alone with a solitary aboriginal, pushed on, and was
eventually rescued by a French whaling ship, the
<i>Mississippi</i>, and reached Adelaide in July 1841. In 1845 he
returned to England, and in 1847, when Earl Grey separated the
colony of New Zealand into two provinces and appointed
lieut.-governors, Mr. Eyre was nominated to this office for the
South Island, Sir George Grey being then Governor-in-Chief. During
his term of office he lived mostly at Wellington; but his powers as
lieut.-governor were inconsiderable, owing to the overshadowing
authority of the Governor-in-Chief. In 1853 he retired and went to
England, and in December of the following year was appointed
Governor of the island of St. Vincent, and subsequently
Lieut.-Governor of the Leeward Islands. On July 13th, 1864, he was
made Captain-General and Governor-General-in-Chief and Vice-Admiral
of Jamaica. It was during his tenure of office that the
insurrection broke out in Oct. 1865, but owing to his energetic
measures it was completely crushed. His action, especially in
relation to the execution under sentence of court martial of George
William Gordon, a mulatto of property, was, however, much canvassed
in England, and he was recalled, and a commission of inquiry
appointed to investigate the charges against him. The result was to
exonerate him from blame; but his accusers, not content with the
issue, instituted proceedings against him, which lasted for four
years, but came to nothing. A "Jamaica committee" was formed to
carry on the prosecution, which led to a defence fund being
started. Mr. Eyre was then prosecuted for murder before the
magistrates of Market Drayton, in Shropshire, but they declined to
commit him for trial. Subsequent proceedings before the Court of
Queen's Bench also proved abortive. Mr. Eyre is the author of
"Discoveries in Central Australia," 1845; "Journals of Expeditions
and Discovery into Central Australia, and Overland from Adelaide to
King George's Sound," 1846. He resides at Steeple Aston, in
Oxfordshire.</p>

C.B., second son of Colonel Sir Henry Fairfax, Bart., was born in
1837, and entered the Royal Navy in 1850, becoming commander in
1862, captain in 1868, and rear-admiral in 1885. He was naval
<i>attaché</i> to Sir Bartle Frere's mission to Zanzibar in 1872-3;
private secretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty in 1873-4; and
was created C.B. (Civil Division) in 1879, and Military Division in
1882. He commanded H.M.S. <i>Monarch</i> at the bombardment of
Alexandria in 1882, for which he received a medal, the Khedive's
bronze star and the 3rd class Osmanlieh. He was naval aide-de-camp
to the Queen from 1879 to 1885 and Commander-in-Chief on the
Australian station from 1887 to 1889, assuming the command on the
17th of April in the former year. In 1889 Admiral Fairfax became
Second Naval Lord of the Admiralty. Admiral Fairfax married, in
1872, Harriet, daughter of Sir David Kinloch, 9th Bart.</p>

<p><a name="A445" id="A445"></a><b>Fairfax, Hon. John</b>, M.L.C.,
whose reputation is inseparably identified with the pioneer days of
Australian journalism, was born at Warwick in 1804. Trained as a
compositor, he obtained employment on the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>
of London at the completion of his apprenticeship; but, after a
time, returned to his native county and commenced business as a
printer and bookseller at Leamington, where he started the
<i>Leamington Spa Chronicle</i>. The venture was successful; but an
outspoken criticism upon the conduct of public officials resulted
in a prosecution for libel. Mr. Fairfax successfully defended his
position; but was overwhelmed with the heavy costs of litigation,
and this circumstance caused him to emigrate to Sydney in 1838. He
obtained employment on the <i>Sydney Herald</i>, which had begun
its career in 1831, and was then issued bi-weekly by Mr. F. M.
Stokes, and as a daily in 1840. Mr. Fairfax also obtained the
position of librarian to the Australian Subscription Library in
Sydney, Sept. 13th, 1838. His energy, prudence, and enterprise
secured him powerful friends. The proprietor of the <i>Herald</i>
wishing to retire from business, the paper was purchased in 1841 by
Mr. Fairfax and Mr. C. Kemp, a reporter, for the sum of £10,000,
which was partly advanced by friends of the new proprietors. The
partnership prospered, and the foundation of the great future
success of the Herald was securely laid. The paper has always
jealously asserted its independence, and has never been considered
a party journal. It has been conducted with rare moderation and
unusual literary ability, and has secured an amount of commercial
support which is unprecedented even in the colonies. In 1851 Mr.
Fairfax revisited Leamington, and honourably defrayed all the
liabilities which he had left when he emigrated thirteen years
before. His old townsmen recognised his sterling qualities, and
gave him a most cordial reception. Returning to Sydney in 1853, Mr.
Fairfax purchased the share of his partner, Mr. Kemp, and became
the sole owner of his paper, which since August 1st, 1842, had
assumed the name of the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>. In 1867 Mr.
Charles Fairfax was taken into partnership, and on the accidental
death of his eldest son, Mr. John Fairfax admitted his younger
sons&mdash;Mr. James Reading Fairfax and Mr. Edward Ross Fairfax.
Under their management the paper acquired an undisputed precedence
in New South Wales. Mr. John Fairfax again visited England in 1863,
and utilised his leisure to familiarise himself with all the latest
phases of newspaper management, with the result that his own
journals were always in possession of the most modern machinery and
equipments. In the political struggles of his day Mr. Fairfax took
little personal part. He once sought election to the Legislative
Assembly, and was defeated; but in 1874 he was nominated to a seat
in the Legislative Council. He was a devoutly religious man, and
throughout his career was a prominent member and a most generous
supporter of the Congregational body. In 1840 he was chosen as a
deacon of the Pitt Street Congregational Church, in Sydney, and
took a deep interest in its welfare until his death, which took
place at his residence, Ginahgulla, Bose Bay, Port Jackson, June
16th, 1877. His two sons conducted the <i>Herald</i>, and its
powerful adjuncts, the <i>Mail</i> and <i>Echo</i>, until 1888,
when Mr. E. R. Fairfax withdrew from the partnership. Mr. J. R.
Fairfax then admitted his sons&mdash;Messrs. Charles Geoffrey and
James Fairfax, jun.&mdash;into the partnership, and as he only
exercises a supervising influence himself, the control of the
journals is virtually vested in them.</p>

acted for some time as Chairman of Committees, he was Secretary for
Lands in the Parkes Government from May 1872 to Feb. 1875. In Dec
1877, on the defeat of Sir John Robertson, he became Premier of the
colony of New South Wales, with the portfolio of Minister of Lands.
Failing, however, to carry his Land Bill, he resigned in Dec. 1878.
He was again Secretary for Lands in the Stuart Government from Jan.

M.A. Having taken orders in the Church of England, he emigrated to
South Australia, and arrived in Sept. 1840, when he acted as
assistant to Rev. C. B. Howard, the first Colonial Chaplain. He had
sole charge of the Anglican communion in Adelaide from 1843 to
1846, when he was relieved by the arrival of Archdeacon Woodcock
and the Rev. James Pollitt. On Dr. Short (the first bishop's)
arrival, in Dec. 1847, Mr. Farrell was created Dean of Trinity
Church, which at first served as the cathedral of the diocese.
Prior to this, in Nov. 1845, Mr. Farrell married the widow of the
Rev. C. B. Howard, whom he succeeded as Colonial Chaplain, an
office which expired with him. He died at Malvern, whilst on a
visit to England, on April 26th, 1869. He left four scholarships of
£50 each to St. Peter's Collegiate School, Adelaide; and a window
was erected to his memory in Trinity Church, which he had been
incumbent of as well as dean.</p>

<p><a name="A450" id="A450"></a><b>Farrell, John</b>, was born in
Buenos Ayres, La Plata, South America, on Dec. 18th, 1851, of Irish
parentage. He came with his parents to Victoria in the following
year, and up to the age of twenty was engaged in farming in that
colony. He afterwards learned the trade of a brewer in Sandhurst,
and followed this business for several years in New South Wales. He
contributed during this period a number of poems on Australia and
other subjects to various periodicals, notably the <i>Bulletin</i>,
which attracted a good deal of notice; and in 1887 published a
volume, "How He Died, and other Poems." On the publication of
"Progress and Poverty," Mr. Farrell became convinced that Henry
George had found the solution to the problems of social want and
misery, and has since largely devoted himself to the work of
spreading abroad a knowledge of the single tax principle. In 1888
he established a newspaper at Lithgow, N.S.W., with this object,
which had a considerable influence on public thought. In 1889 he
joined with several others in bringing Henry George through the
colonies on a lecturing tour, and in June 1890 became editor of the
Sydney <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. Some months afterwards he resigned
this position, but remains on the editorial staff of that journal.
Mr, Farrell was married in Melbourne in 1876, and is regarded as
one of the most uncompromising leaders of the Single Tax Movement
in Australia.</p>

Berlin, arriving in New South Wales in 1863. After residing in
Sydney a year he relinquished his commercial employment and went on
to a station in the frontier squatting districts of Northern
Queensland, where he was actively engaged during the early
pioneering times. Subsequently he gave his attention to
"overlanding" (i.e. taking cattle across country) and wrote for the
press under the <i>nom de plume</i> of "Dramingo." In 1878 the
proprietor of the <i>Queenslander</i> newspaper employed him to
explore the line of country extending from Blackall, on the west
boundary line of Queensland, to Port Darwin, with the view of
solving the question then being debated as to whether a railway
could be constructed across the continent along that route. The
task was successfully performed by Mr. Favenc at the head of a
small and well-equipped party. In 1888 Messrs. Favenc and Crawford
explored the McArthur from the Queensland boundary, In 1888 Mr.
Favenc published a "History of Australian Exploration" (London and
Sydney). Mr. Favenc has the advantage of being a good artist as
well as a facile writer. His <i>magnum opus</i>, the "History of
Australian Exploration," was dedicated to Sir Henry Parkes, and was
published in one large volume at the expense of the New South Wales

<p><a name="A453" id="A453"></a><b>Fawkner, Hon. John Pascoe</b>,
M.L.C., who has sometimes been styled "the father of the colony of
Victoria," was the son of John Fawkner and Hannah his wife, and was
born in London on Oct. 20th, 1792. On Feb. 10th, 1803, he, with his
parents, sailed in the <i>Calcutta</i> with the expedition sent out
under Collins to found a penal settlement at Port Phillip, where
they arrived on Oct. 9th, 1803, and landed on the site of what is
now Sorrento. Shortly afterwards the attempt to found a penal
settlement was abandoned, and he went with the rest of the party in
the Ocean to the Derwent, in Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania),
where he arrived on Feb. 10th, 1804. Living with his father about
eight miles from Hobart Town, he first assisted the latter in
farming, and then turned sawyer. In 1814 he mixed himself up in a
plot for the escape of a party of convicts, two of whom betrayed
his complicity. In consequence he was flogged, and had to leave for
Sydney, whence he returned to Tasmania in March 1817. He then
engaged in business at Hobart Town, removing in 1819 to Launceston,
where he engaged in the timber trade, which he relinquished in
1826, and started a public-house at Launceston called the Cornwall
Hotel. In 1829 he started the <i>Launceston Advertiser</i>, which
he sold in 1831, acting in the meantime as a sort of amateur
solicitor or "agent" for litigants in the local police courts. In
1835 Fawkner concocted a plan for the settlement of Port Phillip
and brought five associates into his scheme, for the effectuation
of which he bought the schooner <i>Enterprise</i>, of fifty-five
tons burden. The expedition sailed from George Town, Tasmania, on
July 27th, but was obliged to beat about for three days, during
which Fawkner suffered so much from sea sickness that he had
himself put ashore again, the <i>Enterprise</i>, with his
coadjutors, proceeding to Western Port, in what is now Victoria,
where they arrived on August 8th. Not liking the look of the
adjacent country, the party made for what is now Hobson's Bay, and
undeterred by warnings that "John Batman, King of Port Phillip, had
bought all the lands and desired all trespassers to keep aloof,"
explored the Yarra Yarra river, with which and the surrounding
district they were much delighted. They put the first plough into
the earth on Sept. 8th, 1835, and sowed the first crop of five
acres of wheat. Fawkner himself, cheered by the accounts which the
advance party brought back, landed in Hobson's Bay in Oct. 1835,
and may be justly regarded as the real founder of Melbourne,
leaving Messrs. Batman (who reached Hobson's Bay in May 1835) and
Henty to dispute the glory of being the founders of the colony. In
Jan. 1838 Fawkner started the first newspaper, which was written on
four pages of foolscap. In March some type arrived from Tasmania,
and the journal was printed weekly. In 1839 he commenced the
<i>Port Phillip Patriot</i>, which he afterwards made into a daily
paper, and which is now, after many mutations, the daily
<i>Argus</i>. In 1842 he was elected one of the Market
Commissioners, and in 1843 a town councillor, an office which he
held for many years. In 1851 he was elected a member of the first
Legislative Council for Dalhousie, and on the introduction of a
free Parliament in Victoria in 1856 was returned to the Legislative
Council for the central province. Though Batman must have the
credit of originally selecting the site of Melbourne, Fawkner not
only followed closely on his heels, but in his uncouth way
contributed materially to promoting the infant interests of what is
now the magnificent Victorian metropolis. He was also to the fore
in all the public affairs of the colony, generally on the Liberal
side. He took a leading part in the movement for declining to elect
members for Port Phillip to the New South Wales Legislative Council
before its separation from the mother colony. A public meeting in
Melbourne selected him as one of the delegates to negotiate a
compromise between the Government and the malcontents during the
riots regarding the diggers' licences in 1854. In Nov. of that year
the Governor, Sir Charles Hotham, nominated him as one of the
members of a special commission which he appointed to inquire into
the grievances or the goldfields; and he was a party to the
voluminous report which they sent in. He died on Sept. 4th,
1869.</p>

M.D., sometime Agent-General, New Zealand, fourth son of Thomas
Featherston, of Cotfield House, Durham, was born in Durham on March
21st, 1813, and took his M.D. degree at Edinburgh in 1836. He was
one of the earliest settlers in Wellington, N.Z., under the New
Zealand Company. He took a prominent part in the agitation for
self-government in and about 1850. In 1852, when the province of
Wellington was constituted, he was elected first superintendent,
and represented Wanganui in Parliament from 1853 to 1871, when he
resigned the superintendency. From July 12th to August 2nd, 1861,
he was Colonial Secretary under Mr. Fox, and held office without
portfolio under the same gentleman from Nov. 16th, 1869, to March
31st, 1871. In Jan. 1866 he persuaded the friendly Maoris about
Wanganui to join General Chute in his campaign on the west coast,
and his march toward Mount Egmont; and he himself accompanied and
led the Maori contingent in the various actions at Otapawa and
elsewhere. For his gallantry on these occasions he received the New
Zealand Cross, on the recommendation of General Chute. In 1869 Dr.
Featherston was sent home to England, in company with Mr. Dillon
Bell, as commissioner to treat with the Imperial Government for a
force to put down rebellion and to raise another force for colonial
service. When the Vogel Government started the Public Works policy,
the Commissioners were instructed to arrange with the Home
Government to guarantee a loan for £1,000,000 for public works and
immigration, to be spent at a rate not exceeding £200,000 a year.
This they succeeded in doing. By the Public Works and Immigration
Act of 1870, the office of Agent-General in London was created, and
Dr. Featherston became first Agent-General. This post he held from
the year 1871 till his death at Brighton on June 19th, 1876. Dr.
Featherston married, in 1839, a daughter of Mr. A. Scott, of
Edinburgh.</p>

companies in England and Canada, prior to emigrating to Victoria,
where he arrived in April 1858, and was appointed traffic manager
of the Victoria railways. Mr. Fehon subsequently engaged in
pastoral and commercial pursuits, but in 1888 accepted a position
as one of the Commissioners of Railways in New South Wales.</p>

<p><a name="A456" id="A456"></a><b>Fellows, Hon. Thomas Howard</b>,
formerly Puisne Judge, Victoria, son of Thomas Fellows, of
Moneyhill, Herts, solicitor, was born in England in 1823, and,
after being educated at Eton and studying under Chitty in London,
was called to the bar in 1852, and soon afterwards emigrated to
Victoria. In that colony he gained a high repute in his profession,
and, having become a member of the old Legislative Council in 1855,
was appointed Solicitor-General in the Haines Ministry in June
1856, in succession to Mr. (afterwards Sir) Robert Molesworth, who
was raised to the bench. This post he held till Feb. 1857, when he
succeeded Sir William Stawell (appointed Chief Justice) as
Attorney-General. In the meantime responsible government had been
inaugurated, and Mr. Fellows had been returned to the first
Legislative Assembly for St. Kilda as the colleague of Mr. (now
Sir) F. T. Sargood. In March 1857 Mr. Fellows retired from office
on the defeat of the Haines Ministry. They came back to power again
a month later, and Mr. Fellows was their Solicitor-General till
March 1858, when he quitted the Assembly, and was elected to the
Legislative Council, in opposition to Mr. T. T. à-Beckett. He
represented the Nicholson Ministry in the Upper House, without
portfolio, from Oct. to Nov. 1860. In Oct. 1863 Mr. Fellows joined
that powerful combination, the first McCulloch Ministry, as
Postmaster-General, but quitted the Cabinet in March 1864, as soon
as the drift of their policy was made apparent. He now appeared as
the determined opponent of his former colleagues, and led the
Council in their resistance to the Tariff and Darling grant
"tacks." The better to champion the cause of the Conservative
party, he resigned his seat in the Council, and was returned in
1867 to the Legislative Assembly for St. Kilda. The McCullochites
commanded an overwhelming majority in the Lower House, but Mr.
Fellows discharged the difficult task of marshalling his meagre
minority with conspicuous tact and ability. In 1868 Sir James
McCulloch resigned, owing to a difference with the Governor over
the procedure to be pursued in relation to the Darling grant; and
after prolonged negotiations, during the course of which Mr.
Fellows was frequently suggested as Premier, Sir Charles Sladen
agreed to champion the forlorn hope of the Council in their
constitutional battle with the Assembly, Mr. Fellows agreeing to
take the leadership of the latter body, with the portfolio of
Minister of Justice. In spite of several hostile votes carried
against them in the popular Chamber, the Sladen Ministry held on
from May 6th to July 11th, 1868, when the crisis was terminated by
a request from Sir Charles Darling that the grant should be
withdrawn, as he had made his peace with the Colonial Office. Mr.
Fellows did not again take office, though he remained in the
Assembly till 1872, when, it having been decided to nominate a
fifth Puisne Judge, he was appointed to that position by the
Francis Ministry, and remained on the bench till his death, on
April 8th, 1878.</p>

<p><a name="A457" id="A457"></a><b>Fenton, Francis Dart</b>, a
native of Yorkshire, went out to Auckland, N.Z., in 1850, and
cultivated land on the Waikato River. In 1851 he was appointed by
Sir George Grey (then Governor) to a position in the Deeds Office
at Auckland, and subsequently became Resident Magistrate and
Collector of Customs at Kaipara. In March 1856 he was made Native
Secretary by Governor Browne; but his policy clashing with that of
Mr. (afterwards Sir) Donald McLean, Chief Native Land Commissioner,
he was compelled to resign, and was appointed Resident Magistrate
at Whaingaroa. On May 9th, 1857, as the result of a paper of
suggestions which he had addressed to the Governor, he was summoned
to act as magistrate at Waikato at a critical time in the
difficulties preceding the Waikato war. His appointment, "at the
earnest request of the natives," was the promise of a new departure
on the part of the Government, who had resolved that the Maoris
should be governed by laws "enacted with their own consent," and
instructed Mr. Fenton to prepare a code upon this understanding.
Mr. Fenton proceeded to Waikato, but on July 14th, 1857, Potatau
accepted the kingship offered him by the malcontent tribes, and he
was shortly afterwards withdrawn. From 1858 to 1864 Mr. Fenton
acted as assistant law officer of the Crown. In 1861 he prepared
the Domain Act, and in 1863 was charged with the working of the New
Zealand Settlement Act. Mr. Fenton was admitted as a barrister and
solicitor in New Zealand in Jan. 1857. In 1865 Mr. Fenton was
employed to draw up the Native Lands Act, and became Chief Judge of
the Native Land Court, a post which he held for seventeen years. In
1869 he was called to the Legislative Council, and introduced a
bill to amend the Native Lands Act, which was passed, but he failed
to pass the Native Reserves Bill. He assisted in the successful
opposition to the importation of Ghoorka regiments for the purposes
of the war, but was ultimately disqualified as an official from
sitting in the Council. He was for two years district judge of
Auckland, in addition to his other appointments, and retired from
public service in 1882. Mr. Fenton is singularly well acquainted
with the Maori language, and the history and customs of the people.
In addition to various pamphlets, he is the author of "Observations
on the State of the Aboriginal Inhabitants of New Zealand"
(Auckland, 1859), and "Suggestions for a History of the Origin and
Migrations of the Maori People" (1885).</p>

<p><a name="A458" id="A458"></a><b>Fenton, James</b>, son of James
Fenton, was born at Dunlavia, County Wicklow, Nov. 20th, 1820. His
father was a landholder in the county, but in consequence of
religious and political disturbances in Ireland, emigrated with his
family to Tasmania in 1833. Mr. Fenton was educated at Elton
School, Arklow, and afterwards at the schools of Mr. James Thomson
and Mr. R. W. Giblin at Hobart. In 1839 he took up land in West
Devon, Northern Tasmania, where he was the first settler. He was an
active pioneer of the district, was appointed a J.P. in 1856, and
was for years Chairman of the Devon Road Trust. After seeing Devon
grow into a populous district he fixed his residence in Launceston.
Mr. Fenton has for half a century been a constant contributor to
colonial newspapers and magazines. His "History of Tasmania" was
published at Hobart in 1884. He is also author of the "Life of Rev.
Charles Price" (Melbourne, 1886), and "Bush Life in Tasmania Fifty
Years Ago" (London, 1891).</p>

at Fenton Forest, near Glenora, on the river Derwent. He was
appointed a member of the nominee Legislative Council by Sir John
Franklin in 1840, and was one of the "Patriotic Six," who resigned
their seats in the Council, in order to frustrate the financial
policy of Governor Wilmot, in 1846, but was reappointed by royal
warrant in March 1847. In 1851 he became one of the first elected
members of the Legislative Council, representing New Norfolk. In
1855 he was elected Speaker in succession to Sir R. Dry. When
responsible government was conceded he entered the House of
Assembly for the same district, and was elected the first Speaker
in Dec. 1856. Mr. Fenton continued to fill the chair of the House
till May 1861, when he resigned, and was succeeded by Sir Robert
Officer. He died at Fenton Forest on April 6th, 1874, aged
eighty-five years.</p>

landing in Dunedin in 1856. He entered the office of the <i>Otago
Witness</i> in 1859, and there remained until 1866, when he visited
Australia. Returning to Otago, he became part proprietor of one or
two provincial newspapers, and in 1875 was appointed manager of the
<i>Otago Guardian</i>, a daily paper of considerable merit, at that
time published in opposition to the <i>Otago Daily Times</i>. The
<i>Guardian</i> subsequently became the property of Mr. G. M. Reed,
whom Mr. Fenwick joined in partnership. In 1877 the subject of our
sketch conceived the project of purchasing the <i>Otago Daily
Times</i>, and, after much negotiation, Messrs. Reed and Fenwick
became proprietors of the <i>Times</i> and of the <i>Otago
Witness</i>. Subsequently Mr. Fenwick was appointed managing
director of a company which purchased the property. This position
he still holds, and in conduction therewith he was appointed editor
of the <i>Times</i> in August 1890. Mr. Fenwick is chairman of the

<p><a name="A461" id="A461"></a><b>Fergus, Hon. Thomas</b>, M.H.R.,
was born at Ayr, Scotland, on April 6th, 1851, went with his
parents to Melbourne, Australia, as a boy, and arrived in Otago,
N.Z., in the beginning of 1870. Shortly after landing in Otago he
decided to enter the engineering profession, and to that end
studied at the Otago University under Professor Shand, who was one
of Mr. Fergus's tutors when at Ayr Academy. In 1872 he was
appointed by the Provincial Government as district engineer for the
goldfields, with his headquarters at Cromwell, and held that
position until 1876, when he left the service of the Government in
order to enter into partnership with Mr. D. Henderson. The firm of
Henderson &amp; Fergus carried out several important undertakings,
including the construction of the Mosgiel-Outram Railway, the Patea
Bailway, the waterworks at New Plymouth, and the railway wharf at
the Bluff. In partnership with Mr. J. B. Blair, he was instrumental
in building the Deloraine-Mersey Railway in Tasmania and the
Heidelberg-Alphington Railway in Victoria. At the general election
of 1881 he was returned to the New Zealand House of Representatives
for the Wakatipu district, after a severe contest, and in 1884 he
was re-elected, having had again to encounter strong opposition. In
1887 and in 1890 he was returned unopposed. On the formation of the
Atkinson administration in 1887, Mr. Fergus attained Cabinet rank,
being entrusted with the portfolios of Justice and Defence, which
he retained until Oct. 15th, 1889, when, consequent on the
re-election of the Hon. T. W. Hislop, a rearrangement of portfolios
took place, Captain W. R. Russell joining the Ministry and
relieving Mr. Fergus of the departments of Justice and Defence,
while the latter took over the more important portfolios of Public
Works and Mines. He administered these departments until Jan. 1891,
when, the Atkinson Government having been defeated at the polls in
the previous December, he resigned with his colleagues. He married
a daughter of Mr. Donald Reid (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

son of the late Sir Charles Dalrymple Fergusson, of Kilkerran,
Ayrshire, on whose death, in 1849, he succeeded as 6th baronet. His
mother was Helen, second daughter of the Right Hon. David Boyle,
Lord Justice-General of Scotland. He was born on March 14th, 1832,
and was educated at Rugby and University College, Oxford. Having
entered the army in 1850, he became successively lieutenant and
captain in the Grenadier Guards. Serving in the Crimea in 1854-5,
he was wounded at Inkerman, and received a medal with three clasps
and a Turkish medal. He was M.P. for Ayrshire from 1854 to 1857,
when he was defeated, but was again returned in 1859, and sat till
1868. He was Under- Secretary for India from 1866 to 1867 in the
third Derby Government, and Under-Secretary for the Home Department
in the first Disraeli Ministry from the latter year till 1868,
when, having been sworn of the Privy Council, he was appointed
Governor and Commander-in-Chief of South Australia, and held office
from Feb. 1869 to Feb. 1873. Responsible government leaves but
little to the initiative of the governors of the self-governing
colonies; but Sir James Fergusson is entitled to considerable
credit in connection with the establishment of cable communication
between Australia and England, the construction of the overland
telegraph line from Port Darwin to Adelaide resulting from the
encouragement which he gave to Mr. Strangways when the latter was
Premier of South Australia. Sir James married, in 1859, Lady Edith
Christian Ramsay, daughter of the Marquis of Dalhousie; and this
lady died in 1871, during his tenure of the government of South
Australia. Two years later he married a second time, the object of
his choice being a South Australian lady&mdash;Olive, daughter of
the late John Henry Richman, of Wambanga, in that colony, and
previously of Adelaide, solicitor. From June 1873 to Dec. 1874 Sir
James was Governor of New Zealand, when he resigned and returned to
England, being created K.C.M.G. in the same year. In 1875 he
unsuccessfully contested Frome, and in 1878 Greenock with a like
fate. He was Governor of Bombay from March 1880 to March 1885. In
Jan. 1882 his second wife, who in the previous December had
received from the Queen the decoration of the Imperial Order of the
Crown of India, died suddenly in Bombay, of English cholera, during
her husband's absence at Baroda. Sir James, who was created
G.C.S.I. in 1885, was elected for one of the divisions of
Manchester at the general election in that year, and again in 1886.
In August of the latter year he was appointed Under Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs, and in Sept. 1891 Postmaster-General, in
succession to the late Mr. Raikes. He has been for some years past
a director of the Bank of New Zealand.</p>

and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He passed first on the
list for a direct commission in the army in 1865, and was appointed
to the Rifle Brigade. After serving in India, he was private
secretary to Sir James Fergusson, and Clerk of the Executive
Council South Australia from 1870 to 1873. He passed the Staff
College in 1878, served on the staff of the Intelligence branch of
the Horse Guards in 1879, and was Garrison Instructor in North
Britain from 1879 to 1880; when, having in the meantime become
Captain of the Prince Consort's Own Regiment of the Rifle Brigade,
he was appointed Deputy-Assistant Adjutant-General of the South
Australian military forces, with the local rank of major. In 1881
he was commissioned by the South Australian Government to proceed
to India and arrange for the introduction of Coolie labour into the
Northern Territory. Subsequently returning to England, he
unsuccessfully contested Peterborough in 1883, and, having been
promoted to major, was Deputy-Assistant Adjutant-General in Ceylon
from 1887 to 1889. Major Fergusson, who is now serving with the
Rifle Brigade in India, married, in 1871, Sarah, daughter of Joseph
Gilbert, of Pewsey Vale, S.A.</p>

Margaretta, eldest daughter of Edward Royd Rice, of Dane Court,
Kent. He is the younger brother of the 11th and present Earl, and
was born at Eastwell Park, Kent, in 1856, and educated at Eton and
Balliol College, Oxford. When nineteen, Mr. Finch-Hatton went out
to Queensland, where he remained until 1883, engaging, in the first
instance, in pastoral pursuits in the Mackay district, and
subsequently going in for hard work as a practical miner on the
Nebo goldfields. A pleasant record of his colonial experience is to
be found in "Advance, Australia!" a book from his pen, which has
gone through two editions. Mr. Finch-Hatton is a warm upholder of
the integrity of the empire, and was one of the founders of the
Imperial Federation League, of which he has been treasurer since
its start. In politics he is a staunch Conservative, and at the
general election in 1885 contested Nottingham in this interest
against Mr. Arnold Morley, the Liberal whip. The contest was in the
nature of a forlorn hope, and Mr. Finch-Hatton was defeated by a
majority of 991. In 1886 and 1892 he again stood but was beaten by
his former opponent. Mr. Finch-Hatton is an ardent advocate of the
development of the Pacific route to Australia and the East, and has
been secretary of the Pacific Telegraph Company, formed for the
purpose of laying a line from Vancouver Island to Australia, since
its establishment. When the North Queensland Separation League
extended its organisation to the Metropolis, Mr. Finch-Hatton was
appointed permanent delegate and chairman of the London committee.
These offices he still holds, and it is in a great degree owing to
his energy in the cause that it has arrived at its present
prominence in the eyes of the Colonial Office, and of English
public men.</p>

and became lieutenant in 1827, being shortly afterwards transferred
to the 82nd Regiment. He sold his commission in 1835 with the view
of emigrating to New South Wales as a military settler; but having
been appointed Assistant Surveyor under Colonel Light,
Surveyor-General of South Australia, he arrived in that colony in
Sept. 1836, and four years later became Deputy Surveyor-General. In
1843 he was appointed Commissioner of Police and Police Magistrate,
becoming Registrar-General, with a seat in the Executive and
Legislative Councils, in succession to Captain Sturt, in 1847. This
post he held till 1852, when he was appointed Colonial Secretary, a
position which he had temporarily held in 1849, during the absence
of Captain Sturt. In his official capacity Mr. Finniss carried the
Constitution Act through the Legislative Council, and from Dec.
1854 to June 1855 was Acting Governor, during the interval between
the departure of Governor Young and the arrival of his successor,
Sir R. G. MacDonnell. Mr. Finniss continued to act as Colonial
Secretary till Oct. 24th, 1856, when he was gazetted Chief
Secretary, and became first Premier of the colony under the present
constitutional <i>régime</i>. He was also one of the first members
for the city of Adelaide in the first South Australian Legislative
Assembly, and represented Mount Barker in the second parliament
from 1860 to 1862. Mr. Finniss, who resigned the premiership in
August 1857, was Treasurer in the Hanson Ministry from June 1858 to
May 1860. He was appointed Lieut.-Colonel commanding' the Adelaide
Volunteer Regiment, having raised a company of Volunteers called
the Adelaide Marksmen, and organised a Volunteer force of 2000 men
under the Act of 1853. In 1864 he was appointed Government Resident
of the Northern territory, where it had been decided to form a
settlement. On arrival with his party he selected a site for the
capital at Adam Bay, which caused much opposition, and the break-up
of the expedition. This ill-judged act and the indiscipline which
prevailed in his party led to his recall in 1865, when an official
inquiry took place as to the selection of the site and the general
management of the expedition, the result of the report being that
Mr. Finniss resigned. Having held ministerial office for three
years, he received the Queen's permission in 1866 to bear the title
of Honourable within the colony of South Australia. He was
appointed a member of the Forest Board in 1875, and was Acting
Auditor-General during the next year in the absence, on leave, of

Scotch descent, was born at Dublin in Dec. 1843. At nine years of
age he was engaged in a printing office in Gough Square, London,
and arrived in Melbourne, Vict., with his parents in Sept. 1857,
where he was employed as reading boy on the <i>Age</i> newspaper,
and subsequently on the <i>Herald</i>, his father being a small
proprietor in the former journal. He was next employed as a
compositor by Messrs. Ferguson &amp; Moore, of Melbourne, but left
that firm in 1863 to go to the Otago gold diggings in New Zealand.
After working at his trade in Invercargill, Dunedin, and
Christchurch, Mr. Fisher settled in Wellington, and was employed in
the Government printing office till 1872, when he became a reporter
on the <i>Independent</i>, and having learnt shorthand, obtained a
footing on the New Zealand Hansard staff, which he held for eleven
years, being in the meantime returned to the Wellington City
Council, and holding the mayoralty of the capital for four
consecutive years. In 1884 he was elected to the House of
Representatives for South Wellington, and has represented East
Wellington since 1887. He was Minister of Education and
Commissioner of Trade and Customs in the last Atkinson Government
from Oct. 1887 to April 1889, when he resigned, the vacant
portfolios being taken over by the Premier. Mr. Fisher was married
at Christchurch, N.Z., on March 1st, 1866, to Miss Laura Emma
Tompkins.</p>

<p><a name="A471" id="A471"></a><b>Fisher, Sir James Hurtle</b>,
son of the late James Fisher, a London architect, was born in 1790,
and educated for the legal profession, practising as a solicitor in
Cavendish Square from 1811 to 1832. When the colony of South
Australia was founded, in 1836, he was appointed by the Imperial
Government, Resident Commissioner for Crown Lands, and arrived in
Adelaide with the first Governor, Captain Hindmarsh, in December,
being present at the proclamation of the colony in that month. The
pair quickly quarrelled over the selection of a site for the
capital, and possessing virtually concurrent powers, and neither
being inclined to give way, a deadlock ensued, which was only
broken by the interference of the Home Government, who after their
representatives had spent fourteen months in wrangling, dismissed
the Commissioner and recalled the Governor. This occurred in Oct.
1838, Sir James Fisher thenceforward throwing in his lot with the
colony, as a much- respected private citizen. The same year he
became President of the School Society, and was elected first Mayor
of Adelaide in 1840; being re-chosen five times subsequently, the
last occasion being in 1853, in July of which year he was nominated
to the Legislative Council, and held a seat till 1855, when he
became a nominated non-official member and Speaker of the united
Council which passed the Constitution Act. At the first election
under the Constitution Act in 1857, Sir James was returned to the
Legislative Council, and was chosen Speaker in April of that year,
a position which he held until he retired from the Council in Feb.
1865. Sir James, who was an active patron of the turf, was created
Knight Bachelor in May 1860, up to which year he successfully
practised his profession, and was for some time leader of the South
Australian bar. He died in Adelaide on Jan. 28th, 1875.</p>

R.N., C.B., formerly Governor of Western Australia, was the son of
Robert Fitzgerald, of Kilkee, county Clare, and entered the royal
navy in 1809. He was Governor of the Gambia from 1844 to 1847, and
of Western Australia from August 1848 to June 1855. During an
exploring expedition, undertaken in Dec. 1848, with a view of
confirming Mr. A. C. Gregory's reported discovery of a lead mine on
the Murchison, the Governor was speared by blacks, and narrowly
escaped with his life. He was created C.B. in 1857, and died on
Dec. 29th, 1887, in his ninety-sixth year, at Geraldine House,
Kilkee.</p>

C.M.G., B.A., J.P., son of the late Gerald FitzGerald, of Queen's
County, was born in 1818 at Bath, and educated at Christ's College,
Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1842. He was assistant in the
Department of Antiquities, British Museum, 1844-8, and
Under-Secretary to the British Museum 1849-50. When the Canterbury
Association was founded, to settle the province of Canterbury,
N.Z., he became an active member, and in 1850 arrived in one of the
first four ships at Lyttleton, N.Z., where he started and edited
for two years the <i>Lyttleton Times</i>, acting at the same time
as Police Inspector and Immigration Agent. In 1853 he was chosen
first superintendent of Canterbury, and held the office till 1857,
when he went to England as agent for the province. He was one of
the members for Lyttleton returned to the first Parliament in 1854,
and was appointed to the Executive Council on June 14th. This was
the first step taken towards responsible government, Mr. FitzGerald
becoming virtually the first Premier of New Zealand. The newly
appointed members were anxious to secure genuine power for
themselves as representatives of constituencies, and they urged the
Acting Governor (Colonel Wynyard) to get rid of the permanent
office holders and re-constitute the Government upon "the ordinary
responsible basis." This request being put before the office
holders, including Mr. William Swainson (Attorney-General), Mr.
Alexander Shepherd (Colonial Treasurer), and Mr. Andrew Sinclair
(Colonial Secretary), they declined to advise on the subject, and
on August 2nd Mr. FitzGerald and his colleagues resigned from the
Executive Council. In 1857-60 he was agent in England for the
province of Canterbury. In 1862 Mr. FitzGerald re-entered
Parliament as member for Akaroa, and on August 12th, 1865, became
Minister for Native Affairs, in succession to Mr. W. B. D. Mantell,
in the Weld Administration, which office he held till Oct. 16th,
when the Cabinet resigned upon a practical failure to carry stamp
duties. In 1866, after his retirement from public life, Mr.
FitzGerald was appointed Comptroller-General, and in 1872
Commissioner of Audit, and Comptroller and Auditor-General in 1878,
which office he still holds. In 1870 he was created C.M.G. Mr.
FitzGerald married in 1850 Fanny Erskine, daughter of the late
George Draper, of London.</p>

<p><a name="A475" id="A475"></a><b>Fitzgerald, Hon. John Foster
Vesey</b> (formerly John Fitzgerald Leslie Foster), is the second
son of the late Hon. John Leslie Foster, Baron of the Irish Court
of Exchequer, and sometime M.P. for the county of Louth and the
University of Dublin, by his marriage with the Hon. Letitia Vesey
Fitzgerald, sister of Lord Fitzgerald and Vesci. The families of
Foster and Fitzgerald have been for generations distinguished in
the Church and politics of Ireland, as well as at the bar and in
the judicial arena; Mr. Fitzgerald's grandfather having been Bishop
of Clogher, and his great-grandfather the Right Hon. Anthony
Foster, Lord Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer. Mr. Fitzgerald,
who was born in Dublin on August 19th, 1818, was educated at Dublin
University, where he graduated B.A. in 1839 with honours, and
became a student for the bar, but abandoned the legal profession in
favour of a colonial career. The colony of Victoria, then only the
Port Phillip District of New South Wales, was his choice, and he
landed there on March 28th, 1841. At first he devoted himself to
pastoral and agricultural pursuits, but in 1847 he was elected as
representative of Port Phillip, and in July 1848 again came forward
for election as one of the six members allotted to Port Phillip in
the Legislative Council of of New South Wales. The feeling was,
however, so strong that this so-called representation was a mere
farce, that the majority were desirous not to elect any more
members until separation was secured. In deference to the protests
of this party Mr. Foster's nomination was withdrawn, but a few days
later he was put up as a candidate for the borough of Melbourne,
when the non-election party nominated Earl Grey, the Secretary of
State for the Colonies, in opposition to him, in the hope that his
election would call public attention in England to the grievances
of which the colonists complained. In the result Earl Grey was
returned by a large majority, and Mr. Foster on a subsequent
occasion declined to stand. Ultimately, however, he was elected, to
sit in the Sydney Parliament till he left for England on a visit in
1849. In 1853 Mr. Foster returned, with the appointment of Colonial
Secretary of the colony of Victoria, which had in the meantime been
constituted. He was thus virtually Premier during the difficulties
caused by the discovery of gold and the rigid enforcement (which he
deprecated) of the unpopular diggers' licences. The troubles
culminated in the Ballarat riots, of which Mr. Foster was made the
scapegoat. Aware of the hostile feeling against him, he tendered
his resignation to Sir Charles Hotham, by whom it was accepted on
the ground that the Queen's government of the colony was
endangered, and with the implied pledge that compensation should be
given Mr. Foster for the pecuniary loss which he would sustain by
his retirement from the public service. Mr. Foster, however, failed
in all attempts to obtain any recognition of his claims to
compensation. During his tenure of office he introduced and passed
the measure which embodied the new constitution of Victoria, and
which for the first time included the principle of an elective
Upper House. In 1854 he turned the first sod at Williamstown of the
great system of railways which has since been developed, and was
also instrumental in introducing telegraphs into the colony.
Considerable difference of opinion existed as to some of the
measures proposed by him; but it is remarkable that every one of
them has since been adopted by subsequent legislative action under
the new constitution&mdash;as, for instance, the abolition of the
gold diggers' licence, and the appropriation of the Land Tax to
purposes of general utility instead of expending it on immigration.
The contracting of loans for public works, which he proposed as the
necessary complement of his policy, has since been largely
developed. When his conciliatory policy with reference to the
diggers' licences was reversed by the Governor, Sir Charles Hotham,
and unfortunate results ensued at Ballarat, he retired from office.
Subsequent legislative inquiry proved that for such results he was
in no way responsible. After the concession of responsible
government he sat in the first Legislative Assembly as member for
Williamstown, and acted as Treasurer in the first Administration of
Sir John O'Shanassy from March to April 1857 soon after which he
returned to England, where he has since resided. In accordance with
the will of his uncle, the last Lord Fitzgerald and Vesci, he
assumed the name of Vesey and Fitzgerald in addition to his own
name of Foster, by which latter he was known in Australia. Mr.
Fitzgerald married in 1851 Emily, daughter of Rev. J. J. Fletcher,
D.D., and administered the government of Victoria from May to June
1854, during the interval between the departure of Mr. Latrobe and
the arrival of Sir Charles Hotham. Several of his relatives
achieved distinction in Australia. Of these it is only necessary to
mention his three first cousins&mdash;the late Sir William Foster
Stawell, Mr. Justice Foster of New South Wales, and the late Mr.
Charles Griffith of Victoria, notices of each of whom will be found
elsewhere.</p>

M.L.C., eighth son of the late Francis Fitzgerald, a well-known
brewer in the west of Ireland, and brother of Sir Gerald
Fitzgerald, K.C.M.G., Accountant-General of the Navy, was born at
Galway in 1829. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where
he took honours, and also won a scholarship at the Queen's College,
Galway, in 1849. After spending some time in legal studies, he
embraced commercial pursuits, and in 1859 arrived in Victoria,
where he started the Castlemaine brewery, and did an extensive
business throughout the Australian colonies. Mr. Fitzgerald, who is
also largely enraged in squatting, has been a member of the Upper
House for the past five-and-twenty years, and is regarded as one of
the most prominent representatives of the Catholic body in
Victoria. He married in Sept. 1863 Marianne, eldest daughter of the
late Sir John O'Shanassy, K.C.M.G. He was one of the
representatives of Victoria at the Federation Convention held in
Sydney in March 1891.</p>

C.M.G., Chairman of Metropolitan Board of Works, Melbourne, Vict.,
is a native of Cork, Ireland, and was employed under the Committee
of the Privy Council on of Education in England. Having decided to
emigrate, he arrived in Melbourne in Sept. 1852, and went to the
Mount Alexander gold diggings, where he remained until the next
year, when he was appointed Reader to the Legislative Council of
Victoria by Governor Latrobe. Mr. FitzGibbon was appointed to
assist Mr. Kerr, the Town Clerk of Melbourne, in 1854, and on Mr.
Kerr's resignation in 1856 he succeeded him in that position, which
he held till 1891, when he was appointed first Chairman of the
newly constituted Metropolitan Board of Works of the city of
Melbourne. Mr. FitzGibbon was called to the Victorian Bar in 1860,
and in 1861 unsuccessfully contested South Bourke in the Free Trade
interest. Two years later he was appointed secretary of the
Victorian branch of the league formed to prevent the transportation
of criminals to Australia. He married a daughter of the late Mr.
Michael Dawson, one of the early colonists of Victoria, and was
created C.M.G. in 1892.</p>

<p><a name="A478" id="A478"></a><b>Fitzherbert, Hon. Sir
William</b>, K.C.M.G., ex-Speaker of the Legislative Council, New
Zealand, third son of the Rev. Samuel Fitzherbert, of Buckshaw
House, Dorsetshire, was born in 1810, and educated at Queen's
College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1832, M.A. in 1836,
becoming Fellow of his college. He then took up the study of
medicine, and became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians,
practising for a time in Hanover Square, London. In 1842 he
migrated to New Zealand, and in the following year was placed by
Captain Hobson, the first Governor of New Zealand, at the head of
the list of the colonial magistracy. He was also offered a seat in
the first Legislative Council Mr. Fitzherbert at this time was
engaged in commercial pursuits. Subsequently he threw himself into
the agitation for constitutional government, which was granted by
the Home Government in 1853. Immediately afterwards Mr. Fitzherbert
entered the Provincial Council of Wellington, of which he was
elected Superintendent in 1871. He was also elected in 1856 to the
House of Representatives for Wellington, and subsequently for Hutt.
On Nov. 24th, 1864, he became Colonial Treasurer and Commissioner
of Customs in the Weld administration, in which Major Atkinson was
Minister of Defence. On Oct. 16th, 1865, the Cabinet retired, owing
to the increasing opposition in the House and upon a nominal
failure to carry stamp duties. Mr. Stafford succeeded, but in a
short time made common cause with a section of the Weld party, and
on August 24th, 1866, Mr. Fitzherbert resumed his office of
Colonial Treasurer in succession to Mr. Jollie. Subsequently, on
May 6th, 1867, he added thereto the Commissionership of Stamp
Duties. During his term of office the Imperial authorities put in
large claims against the colony for expenses incurred in the
suppression of the native rebellion. Of this Sir William
Fitzherbert, as Treasurer, remitted to England a sum of £500,000,
which he admitted to be justly due; but with regard to a balance of
£750,000 he absolutely declined, on behalf of the Government of
which he was a member, to pay a farthing. Negotiations and
commissions were resorted to; the parleying extending over a
protracted period and proving wholly futile, until at last the
Stafford Government decided to avail themselves of the remarkable
financial and diplomatic abilities of their colleague, and sent him
to England on a special mission, with plenipotentiary powers, to
come to a final settlement with the British Government. Sir
William's idea of a settlement was the entire abandonment of the
Imperial demand. And from this standpoint he never wavered during
his numerous interviews and communications with the Duke of
Buckingham, the then Colonial Secretary, and the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Mr. Ward Hunt. At last, after months of negotiation, the
Treasury agreed to accept £200,000, this being announced as the
ultimatum; and Sir William was, at the same time, privately
informed that in case he did not accept these terms his further
stay in England was useless. Nothing daunted, Sir William requested
another interview with the Duke of Buckingham, and as a result
obtained a complete triumph and an entire surrender. During his
stay in England he also consolidated the various colonial and
provincial loans, and was successful in persuading Lord Granville
to retain the one English regiment in the North Island. On June
28th, 1869, the Stafford Government went out of office and was
succeeded by that of Mr. Fox; but on Sept. 10th, 1872, Mr. Stafford
again came into power, and Mr. Fitzherbert was Secretary for Crown
Lands and Immigration. The Cabinet, however, only lasted till Oct
11th. In 1876 he was appointed Speaker of the House of
Representatives, and in 1879 Sir George Grey made him Speaker of
the Legislative Council. This latter position he held till his
death, in Jan. 1891. He was created C.M.G. in 1872 and K.C.M.G. in
1877. In 1887 Sir William Fitzherbert visited England as one of the
representatives of New Zealand at the Colonial Conference, and in
1890 he was elected one of the delegates of the colony to the
Federation Convention at Sydney, but died before it met, on Feb.
9th, 1891.</p>

<p><a name="A479" id="A479"></a><b>Fitzpatrick, Michael</b>,
M.L.A., was born at Parramatta, N.S.W., on Dec. 16th, 1816, and
educated at a Roman Catholic school and at the Australian College,
where he entered in Jan. 1832, and carried off the highest prizes.
After acting as tutor at the Normal Institution, he became a clerk
in the Lands Department of New South Wales in Oct. 1837,
first-class clerk in 1846, and clerk of the Executive Council in
1851. Mr. Fitzpatrick was selected as the first Under Secretary for
Lands and Works in 1856, on the introduction of responsible
government. When these departments were divided, he held the office
of Under Secretary for Lands until 1869, when he retired on a
pension. In December of that year he was returned for the district
of Yass Plains, and represented the constituency in several
parliaments. He first supported the Cowper-Robertson party, and
afterwards voted with Sir Henry Parkes. He was Colonial Secretary
in Mr. Farnell's Administration from Dec. 1877 to Dec. 1878. Mr.
Fitzpatrick married, in August 1846, Theresa Anastasia, third
daughter of Captain Small, Superintendent of Hyde Park Barracks. He
died on Dec. 10th, 1881. Owing, as it was supposed, to his attitude
on the education question, he was refused the rites of Christian
burial by the Roman Catholic authorities. A great sensation was
created, and ultimately on Dec. 22nd it was officially notified
that the <i>contretemps</i> had arisen through a mistake, and a
funeral service was performed over the grave.</p>

<p><a name="A480" id="A480"></a><b>Fitzroy, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir
Charles Augustus</b>, K.C.B., K.C.M., ninth Governor of New South
Wales and first Governor-General of her Majesty's Australian
possessions, was the only son of Lord Charles Fitzroy by his first
wife, Frances, daughter of Edward Miller-Mundy, of Shipley, Derby,
and was born in 1796. Sir Charles Fitzroy's grandfather, the third
Duke of Grafton, sometime Prime Minister of England, was the object
of the envenomed attacks of Junius. His half-brother, Admiral
Fitzroy, famous for his storm warnings, was Governor of New Zealand
from 1843 to 1845. Having entered the army, Captain Fitzroy, as he
was then called, was for some time Governor of Prince Edward
Island, and. from 1842 to 1845 of Antigua. In 1846 he was appointed
to succeed Sir George Gipps as Governor of New South Wales, and
arriving in Sydney on August 2nd of that year, was sworn in on the
following day. The year after his arrival in the colony a
distressing accident occurred. On Dec. 7th, 1847, whilst he was
driving his wife, Lady Mary Fitzroy, in the neighbourhood of
Parramatta, the horses took fright, and one of the wheels struck
against a tree, causing the occupants to be thrown out, Lady Mary
being killed on the spot. The deceased, to whom Sir Charles Fitzroy
was married on March 11th, 1820, was the eldest daughter of
Charles, fourth Duke of Richmond. Shortly after his arrival Sir
Charles Fitzroy avowed his entire neutrality in regard to all
matters of local concern, and it was well that he did so, as the
public mind was then greatly agitated on some of the most momentous
questions affecting the welfare of Australia as a whole. Mr.
Gladstone, when Secretary for the Colonies in the Peel Government,
from 1845 to 1846, roused great bitterness by suddenly mooting the
renewal, of transportation and actually constituting a new colony
in the Port Curtis district of what is now Northern Queensland by
the name of Northern Australia, with at view of making it a
receptacle of British convictism on a large scale. The scheme,
however, collapsed on Mr. Gladstone's retirement from office, and
Northern Australia reverted to the jurisdiction of New South Wales
in 1849. In 1847 a long-standing difficulty was settled by the
concession of some sort of fixity of tenure to the squatters, In
1848 the New South Wales Legislative Council, acting in a manner
quite contrary to the public sentiment, passed a resolution of
Wentworth's approving the importation of a certain number of
selected convicts, provided they were accompanied by an equal
number of free emigrants sent out at the imperial expense. Earl
Grey (the then Colonial Secretary) revoked the Order in Council of
1840 by which the colony had been declared to be a place to which
criminals could not be deported, and started transportation on the
old unsatisfactory lines, much to the indignation even of the
Legislative Council. Sir Charles Fitzroy encouraged Earl Grey in
his action all through, and thus appropriated a good deal of the
unpopularity which the temporary renewal of transportation
involved. As the result, however, of a vehement agitation, it very
quickly ceased, and was formally terminated in 1853. In 1851 the
gold discoveries were made, and it was a good deal owing to Sir
Charles Fitzroy's prudent management that the results of the
"fever" evolved were not so disastrous in New South Wales as in
Victoria, where expenditure and extravagance ran riot. In the same
year Victoria won the long-sought boon of severance from the mother
colony, and in May the old purely official Legislative Council of
New South Wales was transmuted into an assemblage in which the
elective principle was partially recognised, the new chamber being
opened by Governor Fitzroy on Oct 16th, 1851. This popularisation
of the Constitution only whetted the appetite for a further
instalment of constitutional government, and before Sir Charles
Fitzroy left the colony the boon of responsible government in
connection with a bicameral Legislature was conceded to New South
Wales. The first sod of the Sydney and Goulburn Railway was turned
by Governor Fitzroy's daughter on July 3rd, 1851. In Oct. 1852 the
Sydney University was inaugurated, and in the next year a branch of
the Royal Mint was opened in Sydney. The progress made in New South
Wales and throughout Australia during Sir Charles Fitzroy's
unprecedentedly long term as Governor was enormous, and predisposed
the colonists to short memories of former grievances, so that
before he left Sydney on Jan. 28th, 1855, Sir Charles Fitzroy was
presented with a public testimonial of £2,000. On the motion of Mr.
James Macarthur, the Legislative Council also passed resolutions
acknowledging the practical ability, sound judgment, and eminent
success, which had characterised his rule; a condemnatory
amendment, proposed by the redoubtable Dr. Lang, being rejected by
twenty-eight votes to six. Sir Charles Fitzroy died on Feb. 16th,
1858. In connection with the Constitution Act of 1850, which
authorised the separation of Victoria from New South Wales, and
otherwise liberalised government in Australia, the Governor of the
mother colony was constituted Governor-General of all her Majesty's
Australian possessions, including Western Australia. Under the new
<i>régime</i> Sir Charles Fitzroy held four separate commissions as
Governor of New South Wales, Van Diemen's Land, South Australia,
and Victoria. He was not, under his commission as Governor-General,
to interfere with the internal interests of Van Diemen's Land,
South Australia, Victoria, and Western Australia, whose
lieutenant-governors would correspond directly with the Colonial
Office; but he had "general authority to superintend the initiation
and foster the completion of such measures as those communities may
deem calculated to promote their common welfare and prosperity." In
case of necessity he would repair to another colony and assume and
retain the government during his residence there, the functions of
the Lieutenant-Governor being meanwhile completely suspended.
Remote Western Australia alone was exempt from such a contingency.
The title of Governor-General was continued to Sir Charles
Fitzroy's successor, Sir W. Denison, and then dropped. Sir Charles
Fitzroy formally proclaimed his new dignities on June 12th,
1851.</p>

<p><a name="A481" id="A481"></a><b>Fitzroy, Vice-Admiral
Robert</b>, R.N., F.R.S., late Governor of New Zealand, second son
of General Lord Charles Fitzroy, brother of the 4th Duke of
Grafton, by Frances Anne, eldest daughter of Robert, 1st Marquess
of Londonderry, was born in June, 1805, and entered the navy in
1819, becoming lieutenant in 1824. In 1828-36 he was in command of
the <i>Beagle</i> in important hydrographical operations in South
America and elsewhere (Darwin him on one of these voyages). Captain
Fitzroy was Conservative M.P. for Durham, 1841-3, when he was
appointed Governor of New Zealand in succession to Captain William
Hobson, and arrived in the colony in Dec. 1843. At this time the
colony was not possessed of responsible government, and Captain
Fitzroy was called upon to adjudicate upon the Wairau affray of
1839, in which Captain Wakefield and others were killed in a
skirmish with Rauparaha and his natives over a disputed section of
land in the Nelson district. The Governor arrived at the decision
to pardon Rauparaha, being of the opinion that the colonists had
been in the wrong, the Maoris having been "hurried into crime by
their misconduct." Subsequently Captain Fitzroy, with the view of
allowing greater freedom in land transfer, practically rescinded a
clause in the Treaty of Waitangi, by which the Maoris could sell
only to the Government, by a proclamation permitting the colonists
to buy on payment of a ten shilling fee per acre to the Government.
This having been regarded as a heavy tax on the sales, in Oct. 1884
he reduced it to the nominal fee of one penny per acre. About the
same time the Waitara difficulty came before him. Colonel Wakefield
claimed to have bought certain lands in the Taranaki district, and
the Ngatiawas disputed the sale. A commission under Mr. Spain
reported in favour of Colonel Wakefield, but the Governor decided
to have further investigations made. This course, among other
things, led to a memorial, signed by many leading, public men,
praying for the censure of the Governor by the Queen. Captain
Fitzroy struggled with his difficulties, which included a lack of
money and of troops, but the rising of a chief called Honi Heke,
and his attack on Kororarika, induced the Home Government to recall
him, and, on Nov. 18th, 1845, Sir George Grey assumed the reins of
Government In 1857 he became Rear-Admiral, and Vice-Admiral in
1863. In 1854, when the meteorological department of the Board of
Trade was established, he was placed at its head, and for many
years devoted himself to the duties of his office. His assiduity
has identified his name to a large degree with the science of
meteorology; but it would seem that his mind gave way under the
strain, for he committed suicide on April 29th, 1865. He was the
author of "Narrative of Voyages of the <i>Adventure</i> and
<i>Beagle</i> and the <i>Beagle's</i> Circumnavigation of the
Globe" (3 vols.), 1839; "Remarks on New Zealand," 1846; and
"Sailing Directions for South America," 1858. Admiral Fitzroy
married, first, in 1836, Mary Henrietta, second daughter of
Major-General B. J. O'Brien (who died 1852); second, in 1854, Maria
Isabella, third daughter of John Henry Smyth, of Heath Hall, co.

labour took the MS. to England to be published by Messrs. Sampson
Low &amp; Marston. He was seized with a fatal illness whilst
revising the sheets of the first volume, and died suddenly in 1861
in London. The history was subsequently published in two volumes,
and is a work of great interest and reliability.</p>

Liverpool, in New South Wales, he removed to the Moreton Bay
district in 1848, and resided at Ipswich. Having entered the
Legislative Assembly of Queensland after the formation of that
colony, he was appointed Chairman of Committee in 1870, and was
Speaker from Nov. 1871 to Sept. 1873. Mr. Forbes died in 1877.</p>

F.R.G.S., F.Z.S., ex-Director of Canterbury Museum, Christchurch,
N.Z., is the son of Rev. Alexander Forbes, M.A., and Mary (Ogg) his
wife. He was born at Drumblade, Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and was
married in Java on April 5th, 1882, to Annabella, daughter of
William Keith, of Aberdeen. From Oct. 1878 to the end of 1883 he
was engaged in exploring the islands of the Dutch East Indies,
travelling in Java and Sumatra; and after April 1882, accompanied
by his wife, he visited the Moluccas and Timorlaut (where, in daily
peril of their lives, they were forced to spend three months),
Bouru, and Timor. The results of these years have been published in
"A Naturalist's Wanderings in the Eastern Archipelago" (Sampson
Low) and by Mrs. Forbes in a volume, "Insulinde: Experiences of a
Naturalist's Wife in the Eastern Archipelago" (Blackwood). On the
publication of the "Wanderings" Mr. Forbes started for New Guinea
to attempt the exploration of Mount Owen Stanley. This expedition
was under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society and of the
Royal Scientific Geographical Society, and under the recognition of
the Government, by whom it was recommended to Sir Peter Scratchley,
K.C.M.G., then appointed first Special Commissioner over British
New Guinea. With twenty-five Malays and Amboinese carriers, he
reached Port Moresby in Sir Peter's yacht, the <i>Governor
Blackall</i>. Arriving too late for the dry season of that year, he
established a camp to the east of the Astrolabe mountains, in the
Sogeri country, whence explorations were conducted for many miles
round the camp, and surveys made of the region. Toward the end of
the year, he accompanied Sir Peter as a scientific expert on his
journey along the north-eastern coast to Nutre rock and the
Boundary Cape, on the 8th parallel of south latitude, the line of
separation between the German and English spheres of influence. On
this journey Sir Peter contracted the illness which so suddenly and
unexpectedly proved fatal. His illness and death prevented the
signing of the papers to authorise the payment of the contribution
which was largely to support the expedition. Mr. Forbes maintained
the expedition at Sogeri as long as the public and his own private
resources could afford, in the hope that Sir Peter's successor, the
Hon. J. Douglas, would contribute the sum well known to have been
promised by Sir Peter Scratchley to the expedition, but not seeing
his way to do this, he appointed Mr. Forbes Resident at Dinner
Island, and subsequently Government Meteorologist at Port Moresby,
whence he was in 1887 instructed to conduct an exploration towards
Mount Owen Stanley <i>via</i> the Goldie Valley. This expedition
reached the very base of the mountain, and would have without doubt
attained the summit but for the unexpected attack on the main camp
by the natives of Ebe, during Mr. Forbes' absence, in which
everything was looted. This calamity necessitated a withdrawal from
the region back to the coast, which was effected without loss of
life, though after many hardships. Returning to England in March
1888, Mr. Forbes was appointed in July to succeed the late Sir
Julius von Haast as Director of the Canterbury Museum at
Christchurch, N.Z., a position he held till 1892. He has
contributed to the transactions of various learned societies.</p>

younger brother of the Hon. John Forrest, Premier of Western
Australia (<i>q.v.</i>), was born in that colony in 1849, and is
one of the most eminent of the explorers of Western Australia. He
accompanied his brother's expeditions in 1870 and 1874. On Jan.
18th, 1879, with a party of five and two natives, with twenty-six
horses and six months' provisions, he started from Perth to explore
the north-west portion of Australia, Port Darwin being their
ultimate destination, which was reached on Oct 6th. The chief
results of this expedition were the discovery of the source and
course of the Fitzroy and other large streams, together with an
estimated area of 20,000,000 acres of good well-watered country now
known as the Kimberley district, which, in addition to its vast
pastoral possibilities, is well suited for tropical cultures, and
has been proved to be auriferous. He was returned to the first
Legislative Assembly of Western Australia as member for West
Kimberley in 1890, and was one of the delegates to the Federation
Convention held in Sydney in March 1891. Mr. Forrest married in
1880 Amy, eldest daughter of Edward Barrett Lennard, of Annandale,

<p><a name="A492" id="A492"></a><b>Forrest, Hon. Sir John</b>,
K.C.M.G., F.L.S., F.R.G.S., F.G.S., Premier of Western Australia,
the third son of William Forrest, of Leschenault, near Bunbury, W.
A., was born in that colony on August 22nd, 1847, and educated at
the Bishop's School, Perth. In 1865 he entered the Survey
Department of Western Australia, and in 1869 was selected to
command an exploring expedition into the interior in search of the
remains of Dr. Leichardt. In 1870 he commanded an exploring
expedition from Perth to Adelaide along the south coast, and proved
the practicability of the route for the telegraph line, which was
afterwards erected. In 1874 he commanded an exploring expedition
from Champion Bay, on the west coast, to the overland telegraph
between Adelaide and Port Darwin, a journey of nearly 2000 miles,
without the aid of camels, and with horses only. For these services
he received the thanks of the Governor and Legislative Council, and
was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society of
London, May 22nd, 1876, and was also presented by the Imperial
Government with a grant in fee of 5000 acres of land. In 1876 he
was appointed Deputy Surveyor-General of Western Australia. In 1878
and 1882 he conducted the trigonometrical surveys of the Nickol Bay
District, and the Gascoyne and Lyons District, in North-Western
Australia. From Sept. 1878 to Jan. 1879 Mr. Forrest was Acting
Commissioner of Crown Lands and Surveyor-General. He is a justice
of the peace for Western Australia, and acted as Comptroller of
Convicts from May 1880 to July 1881. In Jan. 1883 he was appointed
Commissioner of Crown Lands and Surveyor-General of Western
Australia, with a seat in the Executive and Legislative Councils.
In March 1883 and April 1886 he proceeded to the Kimberley
district, North-Western Australia, on behalf of the Government, to
specially report on its character and capabilities. Mr. Forrest is
the author of "Explorations in Australia, 1876," and of "Notes on
Western Australia, 1884-7." In 1874, such was his repute as an
explorer, that the Governor of Western Australia, Sir Frederick
Weld, in writing to Lord Carnarvon, said: "Mr. Forrest's expedition
has bridged the gap that separated Western Australia from the other
colonies, has led to settlement on the shores of the Great Bight,
and to the connection of this colony with the rest of the world by
electric telegraph. I never doubted of the future of Western
Australia from the day when the news of Mr. Forrest's success
reached Perth." In 1876 Mr. Forrest married Margaret Elvire, eldest
daughter of Mr. Edward Hamersley, of Pyrton, near Guilford, W.A.,
and in the same year was created a Chevalier of the Order of the
Crown of Italy by Victor Emmanuel. He is an Honorary Fellow of the
Italian Geographical Society and of the Imperial Geographical
Societies of Vienna and St. Petersburg. He was created C.M.G. in
1882; proceeded to Cambridge Gulf, in the extreme north, in 1886,
and selected the site of the town of Wyndham. In the same year he
was mainly responsible for the Land Act passed by the Legislative
Council, rendering alienation conditional on improvements. He was a
member of the local commission for the Colonial and Indian
Exhibition of 1886, and was one of the delegates of Western
Australia to the Colonial Conference held in London in 1887. In
Dec. 1890 Mr. Forrest was returned unopposed to the first
Legislative Assembly for Bunbury, and became first Premier and
Treasurer of Western Australia under responsible government. In
March 1891 he represented the colony at the Sydney Federation
Convention, and in June 1891 he was created K.C.M.G.</p>

<p><a name="A493a" id="A493a"></a><b>Forsaith, Rev. Thomas
Spencer</b>, who was for two days Premier of New Zealand, was born
in 1814, and emigrated to New Zealand in 1840. He settled at
Mangawhare, on the North Wairoa river, in the province of Auckland,
a hundred and eighteen miles north-east of the city of Auckland. In
Nov. 1841 a skull which had been washed down the river was found on
Mr. Forsaith's property by a party of Maoris, who believed that it
had been taken from one of their sacred places. They accordingly
"raided" Mr. Forsaith's premises in the absence of himself and Mrs.
Forsaith, carrying off everything movable and wrecking the interior
of the house. An inquiry into this outrage was held in the
following March before the Chief Protector of Aborigines, when the
natives reluctantly acknowledged their error and surrendered a
tract of land in payment. The Government also gave Mr. Forsaith
compensation, and he removed to Auckland, where he opened a store.
He was subsequently appointed a sub-protector of Aborigines, and
accompanied the late Admiral&nbsp;Fitzroy, then Governor of New
Zealand, to Waikanae in Feb. 1844, when the latter held a
conference with the Maori chiefs concerned in the Wairu massacre.
Mr. Forsaith interpreted for Rauparaha his address to the Governor
on the occasion. He was elected a member of the first House of
Representatives in 1854; and when subsequently the acting Governor,
Colonel&nbsp;Wynyard, was pressed to initiate responsible,
government under the new Constitution, and made a second attempt to
carry on with a hybrid Government, including the old imperial
administrative officials, he was one of the four members of the
General Assembly who were appointed to the Executive Council in
August 1854, on condition of their resigning in case they failed to
carry with them the support and confidence of the Houses of
Parliament. This they failed to do, for on Sept. 2nd, 1854, two
days after they had taken office, they were defeated in the House
of Representatives on an amendment to the Address by 22 votes to
11. Of this short-lived Government of responsible and irresponsible
Ministers Mr. Forsaith was Premier, so far as such an office was
then recognised. His two days' taste of the sweets of office was
his only one. His Ministry is famous in the annals of New Zealand,
besides its brevity, for the soubriquet which it obtained of "the
Clean Shirt Ministry." The popular tradition concerning the phrase
is that Mr. Forsaith, when making his Ministerial statement in the
House, explained that while pursuing his avocation in his shop in
Queen Street, Auckland, he received a communication from the
Governor requesting his presence, whereupon he went home and put on
a clean shirt and repaired to Government House. What really
happened, according to Mr. Forsaith's own account, was that he had
been assisting his employés to unpack some drapery cases recently
landed, whereby his clothing became very dusty. On receiving his
Excellency's command to come and see him respecting the formation
of a new Ministry, he naturally went home first and changed his
dusty garments. Later on, when making his Ministerial statement, he
narrated the simple incident, and this so tickled one of the
southern members as to wring from him the chaffing declaration that
he gathered little more from the Premier's "statement" than that
the hon. gentleman had gone home and put on a clean shirt. In due
time Mr. Forsaith had his revenge by retorting that, though clothed
with but "little brief authority," his Ministry had come and gone
in clean garments, which was the happiest&nbsp;condition he could
hope for the hon. member when his time came. Mr. Forsaith
subsequently settled in Sydney, N.S.W., and was ordained a minister
of the Congregational Church in 1865. Recently he retired, and has
resided at Parramatta. [This biography appeared in the

November, Mr. Forster being re-elected in Jan. 1856. When the
present Constitution Act came into force, Mr. Forster was elected

age. He was educated at Cape's School, in Sydney, and became a
squatter early in life. Mr. Forster soon attained prominence as a
politician, but in his early career was better known as a satirical
versifier and an incisive contributor to the press. He was elected
at different times to the Lower House for East Sydney, St.
Leonards, the Hastings, Queanbeyan, Illawarra, and Murrumbidgee. In
his place in parliament he was a severe critic of the education
policy of the Cowper Administration formed in 1857, and on their
defeat on this question in Oct. 1859 he himself formed an
administration, which, however, only lasted till the following
March. Mr. Forster was Colonial Secretary in Mr. (afterwards Sir)
James Martin's first Ministry from Oct. 1863 to Feb. 1865, and
Secretary for Lands in Mr. (now Sir) John Robertson's second
Ministry and the succeeding Cowper Ministry from Oct. 1868 to April
1870. In Feb. 1875 he again took office under Sir John Robertson,
this time as Colonial Treasurer&mdash;a post which he held till the
following February, when he resigned to become Agent-General of the
Colony of New South Wales in London. This post he held for three
years, when he was recalled by the Parkes Ministry, and returned to
New South Wales, where he died on Oct. 30th, 1882. Mr. Forster
whilst resident in London, published <i>The Weir-Wolf, a

for Greek in 1850, also the composition prize in the same year, as
well as honours in classics and mathematics. He left the University
in 1851, and arrived in Sydney in August 1854, and for the first
three years of his residence in New South Wales devoted himself to
agricultural pursuits. He then studied law, and was called to the
colonial bar in 1858, when he entered on the practice of his
profession. In 1859 he published a work on the District Courts Act,
which was the standard work on the subject until 1870, when a
revised edition was issued. In 1877 be published a supplement to
the same work. He acted as a Crown prosecutor from 1859 to 1862 and
from 1864 to 1870, when he was appointed Crown Prosecutor for
Sydney, in succession to Mr. Butler, who had accepted the
Attorney-Generalship. In Dec. 1877 he resigned this post, and
became Attorney-General in the Farnell Administration, with a seat
in the Legislative Council. Retiring with his colleagues in Dec.
1878, he again took office in Oct. 1881, being Minister of Justice
in the Parkes Administration from that date till Jan. 1883, when
the Government resigned. He retired from the Legislative Council in
1880, and was returned to the Lower House for Newtown. In 1882 he
was defeated, but was re-elected in 1885, and sat in the Assembly
till he retired from political life in 1888. Judge Foster was made
Q.C. in 1886, and in the following January he again took office as
Attorney-General under Sir Henry Parkes, but resigned in Feb. 1888,
on the ground that his prior claim to the vacant Puisne Judgship
had been slighted. Later in the same year he was raised to the
Supreme Court Bench. Mr. Justice Foster married in 1854 Matilda

1832, M.A. in 1839. He entered at the Inner Temple on Nov. 15th,
1838, and was called to the bar on April 29th, 1842. In the latter
year he emigrated to Wellington, N.Z., and in 1843 succeeded
Captain Wakefield as the Resident Agent of the New Zealand Company
at Nelson. Early in 1848 he became Attorney-General of the Southern
Province, but resigned when it appeared that no steps were to be
taken to grant self-government to the colony. In Sept. 1848 he
succeeded Colonel Wakefield as principal agent of the New Zealand
Company. In 1850 he returned to England as honorary political agent
of the Wellington settlement to assist in getting the Constitution
Act through the Imperial Parliament, and travelled for a year in
the United States. On May 7th Mr. Sewell formed the first
responsible ministry; but on May 20th he resigned upon a want of
confidence motion carried by Mr. Fox in connection with the powers
of the provincial governments, which Mr. Sewell desired curtailed.
But his tenure of office was as brief as that of his predecessor,
as on June 2nd he also was defeated, Mr. Stafford assuming office
with Mr. Sewell as treasurer. On July 3rd, 1861, Mr. Fox carried a
vote of want of confidence in the ministry by 24 votes against 23,
and formed a cabinet on July 12th. In 1862 Mr. Fox brought before
the House a resolution affirming exclusive Ministerial
responsibility for Maori affairs, and, the votes being equally
divided, resigned the same year. On Nov. 2nd, 1863, Mr. Fox came
into office as Colonial Secretary, Mr. Whitaker being Premier and
Attorney-General. The Waikato war had now begun, and the burden of
responsibility fell jointly upon the Governor (Sir George Grey) and
the Fox-Whitaker cabinet. Mr. Fox carried through the Suppression
of Rebellion Bill by a large majority; also the Defence Bill and
the New Zealand Settlements Bill; and it was owing to difficulties
with Sir G. Grey during the progress of the war (notably concerning
confiscation) that the ministry resigned on Nov. 24th, 1864. Mr.
Fox was not in office again till June 28th, 1869, when he once more
became Premier and a member of the Executive Council, after the
defeat of the Stafford Government. During his term of office in
1870 a bill was passed founding the University of New Zealand, and
the Public Works scheme was inaugurated by Mr. Vogel. The Land
Transfer Registration Act was also passed. On Sept. 10th, 1872, he
resigned, and Mr. Stafford came in again; but on March 3rd, 1873,
Mr. Fox once more returned to office, though he resigned on April
8th, leaving his colleague, Mr. (afterwards Sir) Julius Vogel, to
take his place as Premier. On July 29th, 1879, Sir George Grey's
Government was defeated on an amendment moved by Sir William Fox
(as he was now), but he failed to secure a seat at the general
election in the same year. In 1880 he was appointed, with Sir F. D.
Bell, upon the Commission for the West Coast to inquire into the
question of native titles and report upon the confiscated lands,
and subsequently became sole commissioner. He was created K.C.M.G.
in 1879, and since his retirement from public life has devoted

married May 3rd, 1842, Sarah, eldest daughter of William Halcombe,
of Poulton House, Wilts, who died in June, 1892. Sir William Fox is

<p><a name="A501" id="A501"></a><b>Francis, George W.</b>, the
first director of the Adelaide Botanic Garden, was born in England
in 1799, and emigrated to South Australia in 1849. Soon after his
arrival he leased the old Botanic Garden, north of the Torrens, and
was ultimately appointed director under Government. This post he
held till his death on August 9th, 1865. Mr. Francis was the author
of several works.</p>

<p><a name="A502" id="A502"></a><b>Francis, Hon. James Goodall</b>,
sometime Premier of Victoria, was born in London in 1819, and
emigrated to Tasmania in 1834. Here he entered the mercantile firm
of Boys &amp; Painter, whose business he took over in 1847, in
conjunction with his partner, Mr. Macpherson. A branch
establishment was opened in Melbourne in 1853, under the management
of Mr. Francis, and he henceforward resided in Victoria, going
largely into squatting and viticulture, in addition to his
mercantile concerns, which proved highly successful. In 1855 he was
elected a director of the Bank of New South Wales, and was
President of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce as far back as 1857.
In Oct. 1859 he was returned to the Legislative Assembly for
Richmond, which he represented till he resigned in 1874. Mr.
Francis was Minister of Public Works in the Nicholson
Administration from Nov. of that year to Sept. 1860, when he
resigned with Mr. Service in connection with the dispute with the
Upper House over the Land Bill. He was Minister of Trade and
Customs in the first McCulloch Government from June 1863 to May
1868, supporting and in a great measure initiating the partially
protective tariff introduced by the Treasurer, Mr. Verdon, and also
the Darling Grant; the tacking of both which measures to the
Appropriation Bill he cordially approved. He was himself Treasurer
in the third McCulloch Government from April 1870 to June 1871.
During the latter part of the Duffy Administration which succeeded,
he led the opposition, and after the former were defeated, in June
1872, he formed a government which lasted until July 1874, when he
retired, partly on political grounds and partly with a view to
recruiting his health by a visit to the old country. Parliament
under the auspices of his administration sanctioned a railway
expenditure of £2,250,000; but the chief event of his tenure of
power was the passing of the Education Act, introduced by Mr.
Stephen, the Attorney-General, and which established the present
highly popular, though expensive system of free education. Mr.
Francis was by no means a skilled parliamentary orator or an
eminently adroit manager of men, but his downright manners and
bluff honesty rendered him, apart from mere politics, one of the
most popular premiers Victoria has possessed. As a means of
reforming the Upper House and averting deadlocks, Mr. Francis
introduced into the Assembly a scheme embodying the Norwegian
system, but it met with but cold support, and Mr. Francis in
consequence resigned, and was succeeded by Mr. Kerferd. He on three
occasions refused the honour of knighthood&mdash;a fact which no
doubt contributed to establish his popularity. On his return from
England Mr. Francis, though always previously looked on as a
Liberal, avowed himself as strongly opposed to what he regarded as
the extreme policy of the Berry Government, and was induced to
enter the lists against Sir Bryan O'Loghlen, when that gentleman
contested West Melbourne in 1878. Despite Mr. Francis' personal
popularity, he was, however, defeated, and the same result accrued
when he again opposed Sir Bryan on his seeking re-election after
accepting the office of Attorney-General in the Berry Government.
Shortly afterwards Mr. Francis was returned to the Assembly for
Warrnambool, and was re-elected in 1880 and again in 1883.
Meanwhile he acted with Mr. Murray Smith as joint leader of the
Constitutional party, as the combined Conservatives and old
Liberals now called themselves. Mr. Francis, whose health had been
for some time failing, died on Jan. 25th, 1884. His widow, Mrs.
Mary Grant Francis, died in England on May 13th, 1887, at the age
of sixty-three.</p>

same year he entered the New Zealand civil service, and in March
1884 became Actuary of the New Zealand Government Insurance
Department, and also Registrar of Friendly Societies. Subsequently,
in 1886 he was appointed Government Actuary and statist, and in
1889 Government Insurance Commissioner. Mr. Frankland returned to
England early in 1890, and is now Assistant Actuary of the Atlas
Assurance Company. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries
(1884), and has contributed to various journals on actuarial and

<p><a name="A504" id="A504"></a><b>Franklin, Lady</b>, the wife of
the ill-fated Arctic explorer, Sir John Franklin, was the daughter

second wife at Liverpool in Nov. 1828, and accompanied him to Van
Diemen's Land when he was appointed Governor there in 1836. They
arrived in the island in Jan. 1837 and remained till August 1843.
She was a great traveller, and was the first lady to cross overland
from Sydney to Port Phillip, a feat she accomplished in May 1839,
two years only after the latter settlement was founded. Though a
most intrepid explorer, Sir John was only a weak administrator, and
his term of office was embittered by perpetual contentions between
Lady Franklin and Montagu, the Colonial Secretary, nephew of the
previous Governor, Arthur, as to which should dictate the policy of
the Government, the matter being ultimately the subject of amusing
references to the Colonial Office, who when Sir John Franklin
dismissed Montagu practically reversed his decision. In 1845 Sir
John Franklin proceeded on his ill-fated expedition to the Arctic
seas, and perished in 1847. His wife's heroic efforts in organising
search expeditions are well known. In 1860 she was awarded the gold
medal of the Royal Geographical Society, being the first woman on
whom that distinction was conferred. She died in London on July
18th, 1875, aged eighty-three years.</p>

visited Victoria and decided to settle there. He had been
interested in pastoral properties in the colony as far back as
1836, and he now started as an auctioneer in Bendigo, removing the
business to Melbourne in 1853. In 1858 he was elected to the
Legislative Council for the western province, and was Commissioner
of Public Works in the Francis Ministry from June 1872 to May 1874,
representing the Government in the Upper House. He was principally
known as the plaintiff in an action which he brought against the

an article reflecting on his conduct towards a deceased brother who
had died in England in indigent circumstances. He recovered £250.

Inverness, Scotland, soon after it was taken from, the French by
the English. Mr. Fraser was born at Pictou, Nova Scotia, August
21st, 1834. On his arrival in Victoria, in 1853, Mr. Fraser spent
some time at the diggings, but in a year or two turned his
attention to contracting&mdash;at first in road works and bridge
building, and later in railway construction,&mdash;being at various
times a member of firms who carried out contracts in Victoria, New
South Wales, and South Australia. In the last-named colony he was
one of the constructors of the Port Augusta and Government Gums
Railway. While engaged in these works he also entered into
squatting pursuits, first in Queensland, where he resided from 1867
to 1869, and afterwards in Victoria and New South Wales. He is
still considerably interested in pastoral properties in the
northern colony. At the general election of 1874 he stood for
Rodney, in the interest of the Francis Ministry, and was opposed by
Mr. J. J. Walsh, whom he beat by a large majority, and at the
general election of May 1877 was again elected to the Legislative
Assembly for the same district as a supporter of the McCulloch
Ministry. After representing that constituency nine years, he
retired in 1883, and visited Europe and America, being absent about
two years. In 1885 he unsuccessfully contested West Melbourne with
Mr. Carter, the Mayor of Melbourne. He was also an unsuccessful
candidate for a seat in the Legislative Council for the Northern
province, in April 1886, but was returned as member for South Yarra
province in August of the same year. In politics Mr. Fraser is a
man of moderate views, and took an active interest in promoting the
Service-Berry coalition of 1883. He is a J.P. for Victoria, and was
for a lengthened period chairman of the Australian Widows' Fund
Life Insurance Society, and a director of the City of Melbourne
Bank and the private railway line between Deniliquin and Moama. Mr.
Fraser has been twice married. In Nov. 1890 he became a member
without portfolio of Mr. Munro's Cabinet. Twelve months later he
voted against his colleagues' measure for establishing the
principle of "one man one vote," and it was rejected by the
Council, Mr. Fraser tendering his resignation in consequence. It
was not, however, accepted, and the Bill was withdrawn. In Feb.,
however, when Mr. Shiels reconstructed the Cabinet, Mr. Fraser
finally withdrew from office.</p>

Garner (M.D. of Edinburgh) practised his profession, his mother
being a Miss Cobden. Arthur Garner was articled to Mr. C. J.
Phipps, the architect, whose connection was largely theatrical, he
having erected no less than forty English theatres; from which
circumstance may perhaps be traced the young pupil's gravitation to
the stage, where he became a <i>protégé</i> of Mr. George Gordon,
the scenic artist. From the paint-room Mr. Garner soon found his
way to the footlights, and for some time appeared in various
provincial companies. In 1873 he arrived in Melbourne, returning to
London in 1876. In 1879 Mr. Garner began his career as an
Australian <i>entrepreneur</i> by taking out "The London Comedy
Company" (1879), of which the late Fred Marshall was the bright
particular comic star and Mr. George Gordon the hardly less
indispensable scenic artist. In 1881 he joined Mr. J. C.
Williamson, the eminent Australian-American actor, and Mr. Musgrove
in establishing the leading firm of Australasian managers,
generally known as the "Trio," which has controlled a greater
number of theatres and entered into engagements, dramatic and
operatic, on a larger scale than has ever been attempted south of
the Line. Their operations practically commenced at the Theatre
Royal, Melbourne, on July 1st, 1882, with the production of Gilbert
and Sullivan's <i>Patience</i>. Many eminent London <i>artistes</i>
were introduced to the colonies under their <i>régime</i>; but the
most substantial undertaking of Messrs. Williamson, Garner &amp;
Musgrove was the building of the new Princess's Theatre, Melbourne,
in 1886, by universal consensus one of the finest dramatic temples
in the world. Mr. Garner has been twice married: first, to the
excellent English actress, Miss Blanche Stammers, who died in
Melbourne in 1883; and, secondly, to Miss Letitia Hill Martin,

Francis, the then premier, at Richmond, he was returned to the
Legislative Assembly in 1875 for Ararat, which constituency he
continued to represent till July 1881. Mr. Gaunson was a prominent
member of the "Stonewall" party, which, under Mr. (now Sir) Graham
Berry, after an unparalleled agitation in Parliament and in the
country, ultimately annihilated the followers of Sir James
McCulloch at the general election in 1877. Subsequently, however,
he acted in opposition to Mr. Berry, and also opposed the Service
Government formed in 1880. In the following year, on the formation
of the O'Loghlen Ministry, Mr. Gaunson accepted a portfolio as
President of the Board of Lands and Works and Commissioner of Crown
Lands and Survey. He was, however, defeated at Ararat by the Hon.
Wm. Wilson on presenting himself for re-election after his
acceptance of office, and at once resigned his position in the
Ministry which he only held from July 9th to August 2nd. Mr.
Gaunson was returned to the Assembly at the general election in
March 1886; but on his contesting South Melbourne at the ensuing
general election in March 1889 he was defeated by Mr. Mountain.</p>

<p><a name="A525" id="A525"></a><b>Gawler, Colonel George</b>,
K.H., second Governor of South Australia, was the only son of the
late Captain Samuel Gawler of the 73rd Regiment, who led one of the
storming parties at the siege of Seringapatam. He was born in 1796,
and educated at the Military College, Great Marlow. Colonel Gawler
joined the 52nd Light Infantry in Nov. 1811, and served to the end
of the Peninsular War in 1814. During the course of the latter he
led the forlorn hope at the storming of Badajoz, and was struck by
a grape shot in the right knee, and fell from the parapet into the
ditch below, where he lay all night, but was rescued by a private
of his regiment, who had his own head shot off whilst in the act of
saving his superior. When still under twenty he commanded the right
company of the 52nd at Waterloo, and took part in the attack upon
the Imperial Guards, for which he received the war medal, with
clasps. He was appointed Governor of South Australia in 1838, and,
arriving in the colony on the 12th, assumed office on the 17th of
October in that year. The reaction from the over-speculation and
extravagance which prevailed at the initiation of the colony set in
during his term of office in full force, and resulted in an
appalling state of depression, which Colonel Gawler sought to
relieve by encouraging settlement on the country lands, which his
predecessor had obstructed, and undertaking extensive public works
with a view of giving employment to the urban population, whom he
also assisted out of his private purse. With a view of meeting the
Government outlay incurred, Colonel Gawler, despite the fact that
it had been expressly stipulated that the colony should be
self-supporting, drew upon the British Treasury for about £155,000,
the authorities of which dishonoured his drafts; thus, by public
repudiation, intensifying the prevailing financial stringency into
almost universal private bankruptcy. The Governor, too, whose
policy the equity of time has largely justified, was deposed by
Lord John Russell in a manner which has not often been paralleled
in the annals of official curtness and harshness&mdash;the first
intimation which Colonel Gawler got of his recall being afforded
when Captain (now Sir) George Grey, whose father, curiously enough,
had fallen at the assault on Badajoz where Governor Gawler himself
had won his spurs, walked into Government House, Adelaide, on May
10th, 1841, and displayed his own commission to become Colonel
Gawler's successor. The Colonel, after whom the town of Gawler in
South Australia is named, relinquished office on May 15th, and
immediately left the colony. He died at Southsea on May 8th,
1869.</p>

<p><a name="A526" id="A526"></a><b>Gawler, Henry</b>, eldest son of
Lieut.-Colonel George Gawler, K.H., formerly Governor of South
Australia (<i>q.v.</i>), was born at Quorn, near Derby, in 1827,
and went to that colony with his father in 1838, but was sent to
England to be educated. He was at Rugby under Dr. Tait, and
afterwards studied at King's College, London. He entered at the
Middle Temple in Nov. 1849, and was called to the bar in Nov. 1852.
Mr. Gawler married on June 25th, 1857, Caroline Augusta, third
daughter of the Rev. B. Philpot, sometime Archdeacon of the Isle of
Man, and returned to South Australia early in 1858, when he was
appointed solicitor to the Lands Titles Office under the "Torrens
Act," which then came into force. Mr. Gawler was Attorney-General
without a seat in Parliament for a few days in Oct. 1861 and March
1876, under Messrs. Waterhouse and Boucaut. In 1870, at the request
of the Government of New Zealand, Mr. Gawler performed valuable
service in the inauguration of the Torrens system of land transfer
in that colony.</p>

where he was ordained a priest. After officiating for a few years
at St. Francis' Church, Dublin, he volunteered for the mission of
New Holland, and was appointed first resident priest of Port

<p><a name="A530" id="A530"></a><b>Giblin, Hon. William Robert</b>,
sometime Premier and Puisne Judge of Tasmania, was the eldest son
of William Giblin, Registrar of Deeds for the colony, and was born
at Hobart on Nov. 4th, 1840. He was educated at the school of his
uncle, Mr. Robert Giblin, and at the High School, Hobart. In 1864
he was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court.
He entered the House of Assembly as member for Hobart in 1869, and
soon secured a prominent place in the House. He succeeded Mr.
Dobson as Attorney-General in the Wilson Ministry on Feb. 5th,
1870, and remained in office until Nov. 4th, 1872. He distinguished
himself as an ardent supporter of a railway policy, and when
Parliament re fused to sanction the construction by Government of a
main line of railway from Hobart to Launceston, Mr. Giblin as a
last resource, introduced, and carried by a narrow majority, a Bill
authorising its construction by an English company. He was again
Attorney-General in the Kennerley Ministry from August 4th, 1873,
to July 20th, 1876. During his term of office he carried several
important legal reforms, amongst others measures amending the law
of real property and abolishing primogeniture. The most useful work
of the Ministry, however, was an extensive scheme for the
construction of roads, bridges, and public works, which was carried
in spite of determined opposition in the Legislative Council In
1877 he was defeated in a contest for Central Hobart, but shortly
afterwards was elected for the northern district of Wellington,
which constituency he represented until his elevation to the Bench.
He was Treasurer in Mr. Fysh's first Ministry from August 1877 to
March 1878, when he became Premier, but only held office for nine
months. As Treasurer he was successful in placing on the London
market on advantageous terms the first 4 per cent. loan issued by
the colony. On the defeat of the Crowther Ministry Mr. Giblin was
sent for, and formed from both sides of the House a Coalition
Ministry, which held office for five years, viz., from Oct. 30th,
1879, to August 15th, 1884. In this administration he acted as
Treasurer, and his first task was to meet a large deficit, which he
accomplished with great ability, carrying a large scheme of new
taxation, including a tax on the annual value of land and invested
personal property, an excise on beer, and a revised Customs'
tariff. The measure passed both Houses almost without opposition,
and met with general approbation. In Dec. 1881 he exchanged the
post of Treasurer for that of Attorney-General, and remained at the
head of the Government until August 1884, when he finally resigned
office in consequence of failing health. In politics Mr. Giblin was
a staunch Liberal. He represented Tasmania at the Intercolonial
Tariff Conference at Sydney in 1881, and also at the Sydney Federal
Conference in 1883. At the latter Conference he took a prominent
part in the debates and in shaping the Bill which resulted in the
establishment of the present Federal Council of Australasia. He was
one of the earliest and most earnest advocates of the federation of
the Australian. On the promotion of Mr. (now Sir W. L.) Dobson to
the post of Chief Justice in succession to Sir Francis Smith, Mr.
Giblin was offered and accepted a puisne judgeship. During the
absence of Mr. Dobson in England he was acting Chief Justice, and
for a short time Administrator of the Government. He died at Hobart
on Jan. 17th, 1887, in his forty-seventh year. Mr. Giblin married
in 1865 Emmely Jean, eldest daughter of John Perkins, of
Hobart.</p>

<p><a name="A531" id="A531"></a><b>Gibney, Right Rev. Matthew</b>,
D.D., Roman Catholic Bishop of Perth, W.A., was formerly
Vicar-General of that diocese, and was consecrated bishop by
Cardinal Moran on Jan. 23rd, 1887. Dr. Gibney's name is best known
in connection with a gallant feat which he performed on the
occasion of the destruction of the Kelly gang of bushrangers at
Glenrowan, in Victoria, where Bishop Gibney happened to be on a
collecting tour, which he had undertaken on behalf of a Western
Australian orphanage. The outlaws, who, to quote from Mr. Hogan's
well-known work, "The Irish in Australia," "had long defied
capture, and had carried on a career of murder and robbery,
descended from their haunts in the mountain ranges and took
possession of the village, making all the inhabitants prisoners.
They cut the telegraph wires and tore up the railway; nevertheless,
the authorities in Melbourne were apprised of this daring outrage,
and despatched a large force to the locality. The bushrangers,
taken by surprise, threw themselves into the village hotel, which
they defended against the besiegers for the greater part of the
day. Father Gibney, who happened to be in the neighbourhood at the
time, hastened to the scene of strife, so that the services of a
priest might not be wanting, if required. At an early stage of the
conflict he endeavoured to advance through the open, and exert his
influence with the besieged bushrangers to induce them to
surrender, and thereby avert further bloodshed. He was confident
that even such desperadoes would not fire on a priest; but the
officers in command thought differently, and declined to allow him
to place his life in jeopardy. When, however, late in the
afternoon, the hotel was seen to be in flames, the brave priest
refused to be kept back any longer, and rushed to the burning
building, in the hope of being able to administer the last
sacraments of the Church to any of the surviving bushrangers
within. He was watched with eager and breathless attention as he
crossed the open space in front of the outlaws' citadel, the
general fear being that he would be shot down before he reached the
house. A cheer went up from the excited spectators, as they saw him
rush through the flames into the interior of the hotel, and a
number of them were emboldened to follow in his footsteps. When
Father Gibney got within the blazing building, he saw the bodies of
the bushrangers lying on the floor, having apparently preferred to
shoot themselves or each other rather than fall into the hands of
the authorities. He had just time to touch their bodies, and
ascertain that they were lifeless, before the advancing flames
compelled him to beat a hasty retreat in order to save his own
life. The courage and intrepidity displayed by Father Gibney on
this occasion won universal admiration, and the news of his
elevation to the mitre was received with cordial approval by the
press and the public of all the colonies."</p>

<p><a name="A533" id="A533"></a><b>Giles, Ernest</b>, F.R.G.S., the
well-known explorer, son of William Giles and Jane Elizabeth his
wife, was born at Bristol, educated at Christ's Hospital, London,
and after leaving school joined his father and family in South
Australia, to which colony they had preceded him. In 1852 he went
to the Victorian goldfields, and subsequently became a clerk in the
Post-office, Melbourne, and afterwards in the county court.
Resigning his clerkship, he joined an exploring party in
Queensland, and after several expeditions made his first memorable
journey on his own account in the year 1872. In August of that
year, with the assistance of his steadfast friend Baron von Mueller
and his own slender resources, he managed to equip a light party,
and penetrated into some fine country about 250 miles west of the
great overland telegraph line between Adelaide and Port Darwin. The
qualities shown on this expedition brought him friends. On a second
appeal by Baron von Mueller a fund was raised by the liberality of
some wealthy Victorians and some assistance from the South
Australian Government, and Mr. Giles again set out with a party of
four white men and twenty-four horses. He remained in the field
constantly endeavouring to reach the western coast for one year,
when, his provisions having given out and the party reduced to
living on their horses, he made his way back to the settled
districts of South Australia through great hardships, having added
some 700 miles to previous knowledge of the interior. In 1875 he
was fitted out by that munificent patron of exploration Sir Thomas
Elder, of Adelaide, with nineteen camels and provisions for
eighteen months. Through desert after desert for a distance of
nearly 1500 miles he made his way. For one fearful stretch of 325
miles the party found no water for seventeen days. After a struggle
of six months, during which they had traversed some 2400 miles,
they made the outlying settlements of Western Australia. Mr. Giles
departed on his return journey several hundred miles to the north
of his former route in Jan. 1876, and arrived at the telegraph line
in August. In 1889 Mr. Giles, who is a gold medallist of the Royal
Geographical Society, published a narrative of his explorations in
two volumes entitled "Australia Twice Traversed."</p>

<p><a name="A534" id="A534"></a><b>Giles, William</b>, was born at
Great Staughton, in Huntingdonshire, on Dec. 27th, 1791. Having
obtained an appointment under the South Australian Company at the
start of its operations in 1836, he arrived at Kangaroo Island,
where its headquarters were at first fixed, in the following year.
He was appointed a Stipendiary Magistrate shortly after his
arrival, and in 1840 succeeded Mr. McLaren as manager of the South
Australian Company. In 1851 he was returned to the mixed
Legislative Council in Yatala, and took part in framing the present
Constitution Act. He belonged to the Congregationalist body, and
was a strong opponent of State Aid to religion, which was finally
abolished in 1851. He died in Adelaide in 1861.</p>

<p><a name="A535" id="A535"></a><b>Gill, Rev. William Wyatt</b>, B.
A., LL.D., was born in December, 1828, at Bristol. He became a
student of Highbury College in 1847, and graduated B.A. at London
University in 1850. The perusal in early life of the martyr
Williams' missionary enterprises interested him in the conversion
of the heathen world. In 1851 he was introduced to the late Rev. A.
Buzacott, who was about to return to the Pacific in the mission
barque <i>John Williams</i>, along with five other missionaries.
Finding the young man sympathetic, Mr. Buzacott asked him to take
the place of one of the young men, who at the last moment was
obliged to stay behind on account of ill-health. Dr. Gill offered
himself, was at once accepted by the directors of the London
Missionary Society, and was set apart for the work at old Spafields
Chapel, London. In fourteen days from the offer of service he was
sailing for the Pacific. For upwards of twenty years Dr. Gill
laboured on the island of Mangaia (peace) in the Hervey group. In
1872, accompanied by the Rev. A. W. Murray, he located teachers for
the first time on the mainland of New Guinea, Loyalty Island
teachers in the neighbourhood of the Fly river, and Rarotongan
teachers in the south-east peninsula of that vast island. Some
account of this appeared on his return to England, in a volume
published by the Religious Tract Society, entitled "Life in the
Southern Isles." About the same time was published his "Myths and
Songs from the South Pacific," with an introduction by the
well-known Professor Max Müller, of Oxford. In 1876 Dr. Gill again
left England for the Pacific, this time for the island of
Rarotonga, with a printing press, and contemplating the education
of a native Gospel ministry. His hands were full, as he had largely
the care of the outlying islands, where no European missionary had
ever been stationed. His residence at Rarotonga enabled his friend
the Rev. James Chalmers to join the New Guinea Mission, where, in
conjunction with the Revs. W. G. Lawes and Dr. McFarlane, he has
done such excellent work. Whilst Dr. Gill was at Rarotonga the New
Zealand Government published his "Historical Sketches of Savage
Life, with Illustrative Clan Songs." This was intended as a sequel
to "Myths and Songs." At Rarotonga overwork began to tell very
seriously upon the missionary's health. Some nine years ago
therefore he bade farewell to the Hervey Islanders, and was
succeeded by the Rev. J. J. K. Hutchin. A band of thirty-three
native pioneer teachers and their wives, destined for New Guinea,
was entrusted to Dr. Gill's care. These he had the satisfaction of
landing in good health in Port Moresby in Feb. 1884. A pleasant
stay of seven weeks in New Guinea enabled him to see the marvellous
progress made during the eleven years which had elapsed since his
first visit to that vast country. Soon after his return to Sydney
was published "Life and Adventures in New Guinea," by Messrs.
Chalmers and Gill. In 1885 appeared the last volume from the pen of
the veteran missionary, entitled "Jottings from the Pacific." On
leaving active mission service, the revision of the Rarotongan
Scriptures was entrusted to Dr. Gill by the British and Foreign
Bible Society. This work took three years of incessant labour in
Sydney. To print it he was, with Mrs. Gill, invited to visit
England by the society. The printing and stereotyping of the
Rarotongan Bible occupied fifteen months. The correction the press
was a matter of great anxiety, as there was no second proof-reader
in Europe. The book contains twelve hundred and fifty-one pages, is
beautifully printed, and along with the text are given references
and maps. The original translation was made by Williams, Pitman,
and Buzacott. Dr. and Mrs. Gill returned to Sydney in July 1888,
and soon after Great Britain assumed the protectorate of the Hervey
group, so that there could be no hindrance to the circulation of
the Scriptures which had just been printed in the Rarotongan
language. The article on the Rarotongan Bible in "The Bible in the
Pacific," by the Rev. A. W. Murray (published in 1888), is from Dr.
Gill's pen. To the Melbourne volume of the Australasian Society for
the Advancement of Science for 1890 he contributed three papers,
and still writes occasionally for the press. He was created an
honorary LL.D. by the university of St. Andrews.</p>

first-class sheep. He established the Tamar Bank, which was merged
into the Union Bank of Australia, and was afterwards Assistant
Colonial Secretary of Victoria, going ultimately to South
Australia, where he opened up the Glen Osmond silver mines, near
Adelaide, on the property of his relative, the late Mr. Osmond

which he emigrated in 1836, being amongst those who were present on
Dec. 28th, when Captain Hindmarsh read the official document
proclaiming the colony. He was the first Colonial Treasurer of
South Australia, but only held office for two years. He was a large
purchaser of town and country lands; and the Glen Osmond silver
lead mines, worked by an English Company, were situated on his

and went to Victoria in Dec. 1852, when he proceeded to the
Ballarat goldfields, where he engaged as a working miner, and where
he first took part in public affairs as a member of the local
mining court, which granted the first mining lease, and thus paved
the way for the introduction of company, as opposed to individual,
working in mining ventures. He was a working partner in the Great
Republic Company, and was elected, as the miners' candidate, to the
Legislative Assembly for Ballarat West in 1859, being four times
re-elected prior to his acceptance of office in the unpopular
Sladen Ministry in May 1868, when he was rejected. In June 1872 Mr.
Gillies was included in the Francis Ministry as Commissioner of
Railways and Roads, and held office till July 1874, when he
accepted the same post under the late Mr. Kerferd, retiring with
his colleagues in August 1875. Mr. Gillies, who had meantime been
returned for Maryborough, was Minister of Lands in the last
McCulloch Government, from Oct. 1875 to May 1877. At the general
election in the latter year he was returned for Rodney, but was
unseated on petition, on the ground of undue influence having been
used by the Lands Department, by the issue of leases to selectors
and electors during the contest, the committee finding that such
influence had been used without Mr. Gillies' knowledge. Later on he
once more took his seat in the Assembly, and, as a Conservative and
free-trader, strongly opposed the Berry party. He, however, entered
the Service-Berry Coalition Ministry in March 1883 as Minister of
Railways and Public Instruction, and held office until, in Feb.
1886, on the retirement of Messrs. Service, Berry and Kerferd, he
himself was nominated Premier under a fresh coalition arrangement
with Mr. Deakin, the new Liberal leader, taking in addition the
offices of Treasurer, Minister of Railways, and subsequently
Minister of Mines. Mr. Gillies, having been defeated on a want of
confidence motion, retired in November 1890. In 1887 Mr. Gillies
refused the offer of knighthood (K.C.M.G.). He has represented
Victoria on numerous occasions at Intercolonial Conferences, as
well as at the three first sessions of the Federal Council of
Australasia. He presided at the Federation Conference held in
Melbourne in Feb. 1890, and was selected as one of the
representatives of Victoria to the Federation Convention in Sydney

<p><a name="A541" id="A541"></a><b>Gillon, Edward Thomas</b>, was
born in Douglas, Isle of Man, in Jan. 1842. He arrived in New
Zealand with his parents in 1851 and settled in Otago, where for
several years he endured the rough experiences of settlement in a
new country. While quite a youth he became a contributor to the
<i>Otago Witness</i>, and was engaged reporting the Provincial
Council proceedings for that paper, when, in 1861, the Otago
goldfields were discovered. Mr. Gillon was at once sent to
Gabriel's Gully as special correspondent for the <i>Witness</i>,
and was the first press representative on the diggings. He remained
there until recalled to Dunedin to again report in the Provincial
Council, and he was so engaged when Mr. (now Sir Julius) Vogel
arrived from Australia and, entering into partnership with Mr.
Cutten, the proprietor of the <i>Witness</i>, established the
<i>Otago Daily Times</i>, the first daily paper published in New
Zealand. Mr. Gillon joined the <i>Times</i> staff as chief
reporter, and remained on it until early the following year, when
severe illness compelled him to relinquish newspaper work for a
time. He accepted a Government appointment which, after two or
three years, he resigned to resume journalistic work. In 1867 he
went to Wellington as a member of the first Hansard staff, and was
subsequently appointed Clerk of Private Bills to the New Zealand
Parliament. He resigned this office after a brief tenure in order
to devote himself exclusively to literary work, and became
connected with the <i>Wellington Evening Post</i> as well as acting
as special correspondent for the <i>Otago Daily Times</i>,
<i>Lyttelton Times</i>, and other leading journals. In 1872, when
cable communication between Europe and Australia was first
established, Sir Julius Vogel brought about a combination of New
Zealand papers for obtaining supplies of telegraphic news, and Mr.
Gillon was selected as manager. After a time this association
handed its business over to a private firm, and Mr. Gillon rejoined
the <i>Post</i> as editor. In 1878 another press association was
formed, and Mr. Gillon was again appointed manager. In less than
two years this association absorbed all opposition, and developed
into the present United Press Association, which Mr. Gillon
continued to manage with great success until 1884, when he resigned
in order to resume his former position of editor of the Post, which
he still retains. Mr. Gillon is recognised as the <i>doyen</i> of
New Zealand journalists, and when the Institute of Journalists was
formed recently he was unanimously chosen as Chairman of the
Council. At the time of the abolition of the provinces he was one
of the city representatives in the Provincial Council of
Wellington. Some years ago one of the prizes offered by the New
Zealand Parliament for the best essays on the settlement of the
people on the land was awarded to Mr. Gillon. He is a Justice of
the Peace for the colony, and occupies a prominent position in the
Masonic body. As chairman of the central executive committee, he
was the leading spirit in the movement which recently resulted
successfully in the establishment of an independent Grand Lodge of
New Zealand. As he declined to accept active office, the rank of
Past Deputy Grand Master was conferred upon him, in recognition of
his services to the craft.</p>

South Wales in 1839, in command of the barque <i>Uretta</i>. He
took a prominent part in the establishment of the intercolonial
coasting trade, starting a line between Sydney and the Hunter
River, and later on between Melbourne, Tasmania, and Sydney. He was
one of the founders of the Hunter River Steam Navigation Company,
which was formed in Sept. 1841, and became merged in the Australian
Steam Navigation Company, the latter in its turn having recently
become absorbed in the Australasian United Steam Navigation
Company. In the year 1842 Captain Gilmore ran the first steamer
into Moreton Bay, now known as Brisbane, and brought away the first
cargo of wool from that now prominent emporium. He subsequently
resided in Launceston, Tasmania, and was Colonial Secretary in the
Kennerley Ministry from April 10th to July 20th, 1876. He died at
Launceston on Jan. 2nd, 1884.</p>

and from 1853 to 1869 Under-Secretary. On July 5th in the latter
year, while holding a seat in the Legislative Council, he became
Colonial Secretary, which office he retained till Sept. 10th, 1872,
and acted also till Dec. 6th, 1871, as Minister of Public Works.
During his term of office he resigned from the Legislative Council
and was elected to the House of Representatives. From 1870 to 1875
he was New Zealand Government Insurance Commissioner; in 1877 he
once more entered the House of Representatives, and in July 1879
joined the Grey Cabinet in which he held office till October of the
same year: from July 5th to 19th as Minister of Lands and from July
5th to Oct. 8th as Minister of Mines and Immigration. Mr. Gisborne,
who has lived in England of late, was a member of the New Zealand
Commission in London for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition of
1886, and is the author of "New Zealand Rulers and Statesmen"
(Sampson Low, 1886), and, more recently, of "The Colony of New

<p><a name="A544" id="A544"></a><b>Glasgow, His Excellency the
Right Hon. David (Boyle), Earl of</b>, G.C.M.G., Governor of New
Zealand, is the eldest son of the late Patrick Boyle, of Shewalton,
Ayrshire, by his marriage with Mary Frances, daughter of Sir Robert
Dalrymple Horn Elphinstone, Bart. He was born on May 31st, 1833;
and entering the royal navy, served through the Crimean war, during
which he was wounded. Later on he retired with the rank of captain.
He married on July 23rd, 1873, Dorothea Elizabeth Thomasina, eldest
daughter of Sir Edward Hunter Blair, Bart., and Elizabeth his wife,
daughter of George Wauchope. In 1892 Lord Onslow, the late Governor
of New Zealand, having decided to retire, the appointment was
offered to Lord Glasgow and accepted by him. The Ballance
Government immediately on the occurrence of the vacancy conveyed to
the Colonial Office the wish that they should be consulted prior to
a final appointment being made. As this was disregarded, something
in the nature of a protest was made against Lord Glasgow s
appointment, but it was in no way dictated by personal disapproval,
and merely related to the principles regulating the method of such
appointments. Lord Glasgow left for New Zealand, <i>viâ</i> Sydney,
in April 1892, and was received with much effusion on his landing
in June. His family had already formed a connection with the
colony, his cousin, Alexander Boyle, having married in 1883 Fannie,
daughter of Michael Studholme, of the Waimate, Canterbury, N.Z. His
aunt having become the wife of the late Sir Charles Dalrymple
Fergusson, of Kilkerran, Lord Glasgow is first cousin to Sir James
Fergusson, formerly Governor of New Zealand (<i>q.v.</i>). He was
also cousin to the late George Elphinstone Dalrymple, first Speaker
of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. Lord Glasgow was for many
years convener of the county of Ayr, but was not prominent in
English politics, though professing moderate Conservative views. He
succeeded his cousin as sixth earl in 1889.</p>

one of the most extensive run-holders in Australia. He was a member
of the Legislative Assembly, and died in 1870.</p>

sometime Treasurer of South Australia, was born at Exeter, in
England, in 1825, and emigrated to South Australia in 1847. Ten
years later he entered the Assembly, in which he sat in every
parliament from the first to the tenth inclusive. From 1857 to 1860
he represented East Torrens, from the latter year to 1875 Yatala,
and from 1877 to 1884 Victoria. He was Treasurer in the Dutton
Ministry in July 1863, and Minister of Lands on four
occasions&mdash;viz., from July 1863, to July 1864, Oct. to Nov.
1865, May 1867 to Sept. 1868, and Oct. to Nov. 1868, in the first
Ayers, the first Hart, and the fourth and fifth Ayers Ministries
respectively. Mr. Glyde was Treasurer in Mr. (now Sir) Arthur
Blyth's Government from July 1873 to May 1875, and again in Mr.
(now Sir) John Bray's Government from June 1881 to April 1884. He
subsequently retired from public life, and in Oct. 1885 accepted
the Accountancy to the Court of Insolvency, a position he held till
his death, which took place at Kensington, Adelaide, on July 31st,
1889. With the one exception of Sir Arthur Blyth, Mr. Glyde had
been a Minister of the Crown for a longer term of years than any
other South Australian politician. He was a singularly able
debater, and his Budget speeches and financial addresses generally
were models of clearness.</p>

eldest son of John Godley of Killigar, co. Leitrim, J.P. and D.L.,
by Catherine, daughter of Right Hon. Denis Daly, of Dunsandle, co.
Galway, was born in 1814 and educated at Iver and Harrow, and
subsequently at Christ Church, Oxford, where he obtained the Fell
Exhibition in 1835 and graduated second class in classics. After
being called to the bar he travelled extensively. At the time of
the great Irish famine he urged the Government to inaugurate a
large scheme of emigration, by which over a million of the poorer
Irish might be removed to Canada. Failing in this, he devoted
himself to county duties, and in 1847 stood for Leitrim, but was
defeated. About this time he came in contact with Edward Gibbon
Wakefield, who was busy arranging for the settlement of Canterbury,
N.Z. Mr. Godley threw himself with vigour into the scheme, and
joined the Canterbury Association, promoting in many newspaper
articles, notably in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, the cause he had
at heart. Captain Thomas, the agent of the Association in New
Zealand, had secured a vast tract of land, and in 1849 Mr. Godley
set sail to New Zealand to prepare the way for the immigrants. On
the eve of his departure he wrote a public letter to Mr. Gladstone,
assailing in strong terms the policy of the Colonial Office. After
attending to the business of the Association in Port Lyttelton, he
proceeded to Wellington and threw himself into the agitation then
in progress for constitutional government. In Dec. 1850 he returned
to Lyttelton to meet the first four ships of immigrants, and from
that time till Dec. 1852 he was the practical controller and ruler
of the new settlement, having mapped out the town of Christchurch
and being the arbiter and chief of all the colonists. In 1852,
feeling his work was done and the new colony inaugurated, he
returned to England, where Mr. Gladstone appointed him a
commissioner of income tax in Ireland. He was subsequently removed
to England, and became head of the stores department of the War
Office. At a later period he was made Assistant Under-Secretary for
War, which office he held till his death on Nov. 6th, 1861. In 1854
he was appointed first agent in England for the province of
Canterbury, but resigned in 1856. After his death, the Provincial
Council erected his statue in Christchurch, and the work was
executed by Mr. Woolner. Mr. Godley married in 1846 Charlotte,
daughter of Charles Griffith Wynne, of Voelas, Carnarvonshire.</p>

Hum.) in 1857, and M.A. in 1860, being given the honorary degree of
D.D. in 1886. He was ordained deacon and priest in 1858, and was
curate of Christchurch, Kingston-on-Hull, in 1858, and perpetual
curate from 1858 to 1873. In the latter year he was appointed
rector of Sunderland, and held the post until 1877, when he became
rector of St. George's, Bloomsbury, London, a preferment which he
resigned in 1887 to accept the bishopric of Melbourne. He was
consecrated to that see in Westminster Abbey on Feb. 24th by

born at Shipley, near Bradford, in Yorkshire, in 1821. He was
employed by a wool-stapler at Bradford, and subsequently went into
business there on his own account. Struck with the superiority of
the Australian wools, he went out to Melbourne in 1847, and after
visiting Adelaide and other places established a wool business in
Melbourne in 1848. In 1853 he joined with Messrs. Edward Bow and
George Kirk in starting the stock and station business of Bow, Kirk
&amp; Co. Mr. Goldsbrough acquired large station property,
principally in Riverina, but ultimately devoted himself solely to
wool-broking. In 1852 his brother-in-law, Mr. Hugh Parker, came out
from England and became a partner with him in 1857, when the firm
was known as Richard Goldsbrough &amp; Co. In 1873 Mr. John
Sutcliffe Horsfall was admitted a partner in the firm, into which
the son and nephew of Mr. Hugh Parker, Messrs. Arthur and David
Parker, were admitted in 1876. Five years later Messrs. Goldsbrough
&amp; Co. amalgamated with the Australasian Agency &amp; Banking
Corporation, Limited, the whole of the immense combined business
being formed into a company with a capital of £3,000,000 in 300,000
shares of £10 each, under the style of R. Goldsbrough &amp; Co.,

1844. He went to China in the Raleigh in 1857, and having become
post-captain was appointed to the <i>Pearl</i> in 1873, as
Commodore of the Australian Station. In August of that year he was
commissioned by the Earl of Kimberley to proceed to Fiji, and in
conjunction with Mr. Layard, the British consul, to inquire into
the expediency of annexing that island to the Imperial Crown. In
March 1874 they sent in their report, which contained an offer of
cession from the principal chiefs; but the terms not proving
acceptable, they were subsequently modified through the exertions
of Sir Hercules Robinson, who negotiated the conditions of
annexation subsequently adopted. On August 12th following, during a
cruise amongst the Polynesian Islands, Commodore Goodenough was
shot by arrows at Santa Cruz, and tetanus supervening, he died on
the 20th of the same month on board the <i>Pearl</i>, about five
hundred miles from Sydney. This distinguished officer, whose
professional capacities and philanthropic character rendered him an
ornament to the navy, married Victoria, daughter of William
Hamilton. The "Goodenough Royal Naval Home" in Sydney was founded
to commemorate his virtues and premature death. He worked for the

at Cork, Ireland, on Nov. 4th, 1812, and joined the Order of St.
Augustine. Pursuing his ecclesiastical studies abroad, he met the
late Bishop Ullathorne in Rome, and was induced by him to enter on
the Australian Mission, and arrived in Sydney on Feb. 24th, 1838,
by the <i>Upton Castle</i>, the same vessel which conveyed Sir
George Gipps to the scene of his eventful governorship. Dr. Goold
was one of the most energetic assistants of Archbishop Polding in
consolidating the Catholic Church in the parent colony, and became
Dean of Campbell Town in New South Wales. In 1847 it was determined
at the Vatican to constitute a separate diocese in the Port Phillip
district of the colony, and Dr. Goold was selected as the first
Bishop of Melbourne, being consecrated in St. Mary's Cathedral,
Sydney, in August 1848, by Archbishop Polding, assisted by Bishop
Murphy of Adelaide. He arrived in Melbourne on Oct. 4th following,
and accomplished a great work in the organisation of his new
diocese. In 1850 he laid the foundation-stone of the still
incomplete St. Patrick's Cathedral of Melbourne, which in its
inchoate state is still the finest ecclesiastical edifice in the
Australasian colonies. In 1872 Dr. Goold fulminated against the
free, secular and compulsory education policy of the Francis
Government, and in 1880 bad much to do in turning the tide against
the Berry Ministry at the general election. A few months later the
Catholic vote was thrown into the scale against Mr. Service, and in
favour of Mr. Berry, who, however, did not succeed in coming to
terms with Sir John O'Shanassy, who acted as the representative of
the Catholic party. Dr. Goold was a member of the last (Ecumenical
Council, and voted with the majority in favour of the dogma of
Papal Infallibility. In 1874 the Pope, on his recommendation,
created Sandhurst and Ballarat into separate bishoprics, and in the
same year he was appointed Archbishop of Melbourne and Metropolitan
of the province of Victoria, comprising the sees of Ballarat,
Sandhurst, Adelaide, Perth, and Hobart. Dr. Goold, who was a member
of the first Provincial Council of the Roman Catholic Church in
Australia held at Sydney in 1844, and of the second Council of the
Prelates of the Colonies held in Melbourne in 1869, was the object
of an attempt at assassination by his former solicitor, Mr.
O'Farrell, in 1883, but fortunately escaped without serious injury.

<p><a name="A554" id="A554"></a><b>Gordon, Adam Lindsay</b>, the
favourite Australian poet, was the son of Captain Adam Gordon, and
was born in 1833 at Fayal, in the Azores. He was educated at
Cheltenham College, where his father was for some time Professor of
Hindustani, and after passing on to another school was for a time
at Woolwich, and, it is stated, kept some terms at Merton College,
Oxford. After a somewhat stormy youth, he left England on August
7th, 1853, for South Australia, where he joined the mounted police
as a trooper. Leaving the police, he became a horse-breaker, and
married a Miss Park. In 1864 he received some £7,000 on his
father's death, and on March 1st, 1865, was elected to the South
Australian Legislative Assembly for the Victoria district. He was
an occasional speaker in the House until his resignation on Nov.
10th, 1866. In 1867 he migrated to Victoria, and opened a livery
stable at Ballarat. At this time he acquired a wide reputation as a
daring steeplechase rider. In 1869 he removed to Melbourne, and
settled in the suburban district of New Brighton. Prior to this he
had published a collection of his poems at Mount Gambier, in South
Australia. His second volume, "Sea Spray and Smoke Drift,"
published in 1867, gave him a reputation throughout Australia, and
he was cordially welcomed in literary circles in Melbourne. But
this bright outlook was only temporary, owing to the depression
induced by the failure of his attempt to secure the reversion of
the estate of Esselmont in Scotland. His "Bush Ballads and
Galloping Rhymes," published in 1870, enhanced his fame, but he
yielded to feelings of morbid discouragement and committed suicide
by shooting himself on June 24th in that year. Another of his
productions was "Ashtaroth, a Dramatic Lyric." A collected edition
of his poems was published in 1880, edited by his friend Marcus
Clarke, the novelist, who was associated with him as one of the
early members of the Melbourne Yorick Club. Some additional poems,
prose sketches, and his political speeches are printed in a memoir,
by Mr. J. Howlett Ross, entitled "The Laureate of the Centaurs,"
issued in 1888.</p>

Hamilton, was born on Nov. 26th, 1829. He acted as private
secretary to his father when First Lord of the Treasury, 1852-5. In
July 1854 he was elected as a Liberal for Beverley, but lost his
seat at the general election of 1857. In Nov. 1858 he accompanied
Mr. Gladstone on his special mission as Lord High Commissioner
Extraordinary to the Ionian Islands, and on Feb. 25th, 1860, became
captain-commandant of the 1st Aberdeenshire Rifle Volunteers. In
Oct. 1861 he was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick; in
Nov. 1866 Governor of Trinidad; and in Sept. 1871 assumed the
Governorship of Mauritius. In 1874 he retired from the latter post,
but in Sept. 1875 became Governor of Fiji, to which office was
added two years later that of Consul-General and High Commissioner
for the Western Pacific. At the end of 1880 he succeeded Sir
Hercules Robinson as Governor of New Zealand. The new governor
found the Government busy with the troubles in connection with the
native land question, and the "prophet" Te Whiti; and in 1881,
while Sir Arthur was absent in Fiji upon his duties as High
Commissioner, and during the acting governorship of Sir James
Prendergast, the Ministry carried out the well-known raid on
Parihaka, which culminated in the arrest of Te Whiti. Sir Arthur
Gordon, while publicly notifying his opinion that a governor was
bound to act upon the advice of his ministers, whether he regarded
them as right or wrong, was understood to reserve to himself the
right of moral disapproval; and it is believed that his dislike to
native policy of the Government led to his resignation of the
Governorship in 1882. In the following year he was transferred to
Ceylon, and in 1890 returned to England upon the expiration of his
term of office. He was created C.M.G. in 1859, K.C.M.G. in 1871,
and G.C.M.G. in 1878. Sir Arthur married, on Sept. 20th, 1865,

in 1876 he was called to the bar. For eleven years he practised his
profession at Strathalbyn, of which town he was at one time mayor.
He then entered into practice in Adelaide, and turned his attention
to politics. In March 1890 Mr. Gordon presided over the
Intercolonial Postal and Telegraphic Conference held in Adelaide,
when proposals were made which resulted in important reductions in

University. In 1856 he was admitted as an advocate, and in 1860 was
appointed one of the honorary advocates-depute for Scotland. From
1862 to 1869 he practised in London, becoming in 1868 a candidate
for the Border Burghs, but he did not ultimately go to the poll.
Mr. Gorrie's name was first brought prominently to the front in
1865, when he was selected by the Jamaica Committee, consisting of
Mr. John Bright, Mr. Samuel Morley, and Mr. Charles Buxton, to
proceed to Jamaica to inquire into the alleged excesses of martial
law. Mr. Gorrie, who was assisted by Mr. Horne Payne, Q.C., and Mr.
Phillippo, succeeded in laying bare many acts of cruelty and
injustice. Struck with the ability and energy displayed by Mr.
Gorrie, the Colonial Office, shortly after his return to England,
offered him the post of substitute Procureur-Général of Mauritius.
Within less than a week after his arrival at Port Louis he proved
to his own satisfaction that the labouring class of Mauritius were
subjected to abuses, and a report to the Colonial Office to this
effect resulted in the despatch of Sir Arthur Gordon to Mauritius,
with instructions to appoint a local committee to investigate the
charges. The report of this committee, of which Mr. Justice Gorrie
was the most prominent member, led to the appointment of a royal
commission. It was found that abuses did exist, and Mr. Gorrie had
the satisfaction of altering the whole labour law of the colony in
consonance with his own views and those of the royal commission.
Mr. Gorrie held office in Mauritius as Advocate-General from August
1869 to Sept. 1870, and was a puisne judge in the island till 1875.
When Sir&nbsp;Arthur Gordon&nbsp;was promoted to Fiji, Mr. Gorrie
was a few months later requested to proceed to the Pacific to take
up the poet of Chief Justice of Fiji (March 1876). As a member of
the Legislative Council of the island, it fell to the lot of the
Chief Justice to frame all the important legal measures deemed to
be necessary. When the Crown assumed jurisdiction over the South
Seas, the Chief Justice of Fiji was also made Judicial Commissioner
of the Western Pacific, and, in the absence of Sir Arthur Gordon,
was called upon to discharge the duties of the High Commissioner.
In 1882, in which year he was knighted, he became Chief Justice of
the Leeward Islands, and in 1885 Chief Justice of Trinidad and
Tobago. Sir John Gorrie married in 1855 Marion, daughter of Michael
Graham, of Edinburgh, who died in 1884. In 1892 a commission was
sent out from the Colonial Office, at the request of the
Legislative Council of Trinidad, to inquire into the conduct of the
senior puisne judge and the administration of justice generally.
This led to the suspension of Sir John Gorrie, who returned to
England to make an appeal to the Privy Council. Soon after his
arrival he died at Exeter on August 4th, 1892. [This biography

<p><a name="A562" id="A562"></a><b>Gorst, Right Hon. Sir John
Eldon</b>, M.P., Q.C., M.A., second son of the late Edward Chaddock
Lowndes (formerly Gorst), of Preston, co. Lancaster, by Elizabeth,
daughter of J. D. Nesham of Houghton-le-Spring, Durham, was born on
May 24th, 1835, at Preston, and was educated at Preston Grammar
School, and St. John's College, Cambridge, of which he was sometime
Fellow. He graduated B.A. as third wrangler in 1857, and in 1860 he
proceeded to the M.A. degree. He entered at the Inner Temple in
April 1857, and in 1860, upon the death of his father, he emigrated
to New Zealand, with the idea of becoming a lay helper to Bishop
Selwyn. In 1861, having acquainted himself with the Maori language,
he was despatched into the Upper Waikato district as Civil
Commissioner. Here he lived at Te Awamutu, occupied in endeavouring
to wean the Maoris from their allegiance to the "king" movement.
For this purpose, at his request, the Government set up an
industrial school, and established a newspaper called <i>Pihoihoi
Mokemoke</i> in the native tongue, to counteract the influence of
the <i>Hokioi</i>, which was the organ of the kingites. The Maoris,
however, incensed by an article in the former, seized the plant,
and after a stubborn resistance on his part, expelled Mr. Gorst
from the Waikato. He returned to Auckland in April 1863.
Subsequently he accompanied Mr. (afterwards Sir) F. Dillon Bell to
Australia to recruit 5000 military settlers for the Waikato. Mr.
Gorst then returned to England, and on May 1st, 1865, was called to
the bar, and practised on the Northern Circuit. From 1866 to 1868
he sat as Conservative member for Cambridge, but in the latter year
lost his seat. Mr. Gorst was appointed Q.C. on June 25th, 1875, and
in the same year was elected to Parliament for Chatham. From 1870
to 1877 he was hon. sec. of the National Union of Conservative and
Constitutional Associations, and in Nov. 1884 was a member of the
Royal Commission on merchant shipping. In June 1885 he became
Solicitor-General in Lord Salisbury's Administration, which office
he held till Jan. 1886, when the Conservatives went out of office.
In July of the same year, when Lord Salisbury came in again, he
became Under-Secretary for India, which office he exchanged for
that of Financial Secretary to the Treasury in 1891. In 1890 he was
British plenipotentiary to the Labour Conference in Berlin. He was
created knight bachelor in 1885, and privy councillor in 1890, Sir
John Gorst married at Geelong, Victoria, on August 18th, 1860, Mary
Elizabeth, only daughter of Rev. Lorenzo Moore, of Christchurch,
N.Z., sometime incumbent of St. Peter's, Hull. In July 1892 he was
elected for Cambridge University. Sir John is the author of "The
Maori King" (1864). He is chairman of the London Board of the New
Zealand Steam Shipping Company, Limited.</p>

born in Crail, Fifeshire, on Feb. 21st, 1829, and received his
education at the parish school. After some commercial and tutorial
experience, he studied for the ministry at the University of
Glasgow, and at the Theological Hall of the Scottish Congregational
Union. His first charge was in Haddington, East Lothian, where he
was ordained to the ministry in 1855. In 1860 he left Scotland for
Victoria, under the auspices of the London Colonial Missionary
Society, and arrived in Melbourne in September. His first colonial
charge was in Ballarat, where he remained for three years. In 1863
he became pastor of the Alma Street Congregational Church, St.
Kilda, which position he filled until the end of 1877, when he
removed to his present charge as pastor of the Augustine Church,
Burwood Road, Hawthorn. Mr. Gosman, in 1868 and subsequently, did
valuable professorial work in connection with the Congregational
College, and on the death of Rev. A. M. Henderson, in 1876, became
principal of the institution. Mr. Gosman has been twice elected to
fill the chair of the Congregational Union of Victoria, and in 1885
the council of the University of Melbourne placed him on the board
of examiners in logic and philosophy, to which position he has been
elected every year since. Mr. Gosman has contributed to the
colonial press, and has published a number of pamphlets,
principally of a controversial character.</p>

sometime Deputy Surveyor-General, South Australia, was the son of
Dr. Gosse, and was born in 1842 at Hoddesdon in Hertfordshire. He
went to South Australia with his father in 1850, and, entering the
Government service in 1859, was engaged on a trigonometrical survey
at the far north. After holding various positions in the Survey
Department, he was sent to explore new country lying 800 miles
southward of central Mount Stuart, with the ultimate object of
pushing over to Western Australia. He started on April 23rd, 1873,
from Alice Springs, on the Port Darwin telegraph line, with five
whites, three Afghans (with camels), and a native boy. On July 19th
he discovered the "Ayers Rock"&mdash;a mass of granite two miles
long and one wide&mdash;which he named after Sir Henry Ayers. He
returned to his starting point in December, having failed, through
the arid nature of the country, in pushing through to Western
Australia. He, however, acquired an accurate geographical knowledge
of 60,000 square miles of new country. In 1875 he was appointed
Deputy Surveyor-General in recognition of his valuable services,
and died prematurely on August 12th, 1881.</p>

born at Lyme in Dorsetshire, on Sept. 14th, 1804. He was employed
under Mr. Aiton at the Royal Gardens, Windsor, from 1818 to 1824.
In 1830 he became possessed of a fine collection of birds from the
hill countries of India, and the next year published a work
descriptive of them, entitled "A Century of Birds from the Himalaya
Mountains." Other important ornithological works followed, and in
1837 he issued the great work on the "Birds of Europe." The
following year he visited Australia, for the purpose of studying
the natural productions of that country. The result of this visit
was the "Birds of Australia," a work in seven folio volumes,
containing figures and descriptions of upwards of six hundred
species. He also published a "Handbook to the Birds of Australia"
in 1865. Other great works were "The Birds of Great Britain," and
the "Mammals of Australia," those on the "Birds of Asia" and the
"Birds of New Guinea" being still unfinished at the time of his
death. Mr. Gould devoted much attention to humming-birds, and
formed an unrivalled collection, which he exhibited in 1851 at the
Zoological Society's Gardens. These, with various other specimens,
stuffed with extraordinary skill by Mr. Gould, were in 1882
purchased by the British Museum. He was elected a Fellow of the
Royal Society in Jan. 1843, and contributed largely to its
proceedings and to other scientific journals. He died in London on
Feb. 3rd, 1881.</p>

<p><a name="A570" id="A570"></a><b>Grant, Hon. James
Macpherson</b>, a Victorian statesman, and one of the most
prominent land law reformers in Australia, was born at Alvie,
Inverness, Scotland, in 1822. He obtained some schooling at
Kingdenie, and at the age of fourteen emigrated with his parents to
Australia. They took up their residence in Sydney, and, with the
view of becoming a solicitor, Mr. Grant was articled to Messrs.
Chambers &amp; Thurlow, who were in practice there. In 1842, while
still an articled clerk, he was attracted to New Zealand by the
outbreak of the Maori war, and served as a volunteer in several
engagements against Heki. In 1847 he returned to Sydney, and
becoming a solicitor, he practised his profession in partnership
with Mr. Thurlow for some years. In 1850, however, he sailed for
California, but returned from San Francisco on receiving news of
the discovery of gold in Victoria. He and his brothers went to
Bendigo, in that colony, and were successful diggers there. He
determined to settle in Victoria, and commenced practice in
Melbourne, where he soon came to the front as the defender of the
Ballarat miners, who participated in the Eureka stockade affair in
1854. He served them without fee, as did the counsel engaged in the
case, which resulted in their acquittal. The next year he entered
the Victorian Parliament as the representative of the Sandhurst
Boroughs (Bendigo), and identified himself in the Assembly, as he
had already done outside, with the movement for throwing open the
public lands to the people. He also advocated vote by ballot, and
other Liberal measures. He first took office in the Heales
Ministry, serving as Vice-President of the Board of Land and "Works
and Commissioner of Public Works from Feb. 1861 until the following
Nov., when the Government were thrown out. Whilst in this Ministry
he concurred with Messrs. Brooke and Ireland in the issue of the
occupation licences which threw open the lands of Victoria to
agricultural till age. In 1863, when the last O'Shanassy was
replaced by the first McCulloch Ministry, Mr. Richard Heales became
Commissioner of Lands. On his death in the following year, Mr.
Grant succeeded him, and was in office from Sept. 1864 till May
1868. His administration of his department was highly successful,
and his name is still held in veneration by many thousands of
well-to-do selectors who settled on the land under the celebrated
forty-second clause of the Land Act of 1865, which he carried
through Parliament. When the second McCulloch Government was
constituted, in July 1868, Mr. Grant again undertook the
administration of the Lands Department, and remained in office till
Sept. 20th, 1869. He joined Sir Charles Gavan Duffy in June 1871,
and continued at the Lands Department until June 1872. He was
Minister of Justice in Mr. Berry's first administration, from
August to Oct. 1875, and in his second Cabinet, from May 1877 to
March 1880. Whilst in office on the latter occasion he participated
in the wholesale dismissal of civil servants in Dec. 1878, the
services of many of the legal functionaries and magistracy being
dispensed with by his department. From July 1881 to March 1883 Mr.
Grant was Chief Secretary in the O'Loghlen Government. Throughout
his whole Parliamentary career he represented Avoca in the
Legislative Assembly. He died on April 1st, 1885.</p>

Wexford, but on its being sold in the Irish Landed Estates Court to
pay off family encumbrances, he emigrated to Australia, arriving in
Melbourne in 1864. He at once embarked in pastoral pursuits at
Teremia station, near Corowa, N.S.W., and after further commercial
and pastoral experience in New South Wales and Victoria was elected

active part in the solution of the land question on liberal lines,
and was one of the founders of the Victoria Land League, under
whose auspices was summoned a great assemblage of delegates from
all parts of Victoria to discuss the land question with a view to
promoting the settlement of a farming population on the public
estate. The Land Convention, as it was called, met in Melbourne in
1857, and condemned the abortive Haines Land Bill then passing
through the Lower House. Mr. Wilson Gray was elected the president
of the Convention, which also passed resolutions in favour of
manhood suffrage, equal electoral districts, abolition of property
qualification, and payment of representatives. He was M.L.A. for

lieutenant 78th Highlanders, who emigrated to Western Australia,
was born in Nottinghamshire in 1819, and educated privately in
England and Australia. He arrived in Western Australia in 1829,
entered the Civil Service of that colony in 1841, and from 1846 to
1859 was actively engaged in exploration work on the Australian
continent. In the first-mentioned year Mr. Gregory, with his
brothers Charles and Frank (<i>q.v.</i>), started into the interior
from Bolgart Spring; but were stopped in their progress eastward by
an immense salt lake, which compelled them to turn north-west,
where they discovered some fine seams of coal, in the limestone
country at the mouth of the Arrowsmith. They were forty-seven days
absent, and traversed a thousand miles. In 1848 Mr. Gregory was
despatched northwards to explore the Gascoyne River, and succeeded
in reaching a point three hundred and fifty miles north of Perth,
the result of the expedition being to disclose the pastoral wealth
of the Murchison and Champion Bay districts. In 1855 Mr. Gregory
undertook a third exploring expedition under the auspices of the
Royal Geographical Society of London, Baron von Mueller being one
of the party. The object was the dual one of exploring the interior
and of searching for traces of the lost explorer Leichhardt, who
had been missing for seven years. The party started in July, and
did not return to Brisbane till November in the following year,
having discovered much rich country and new watersheds, but no
certain traces of Leichhardt. In 1858 the New South Wales
Government sent Mr. Gregory to renew his search for Leichhardt. The
expedition left Sydney on Jan. 12th, 1858, and it reached the
Barcoo in April, returning to Adelaide on July 31st; the only
traces of Leichhardt which this expedition disclosed being a tree
marked L., in lat. 24° 25', long. 145° 6'. Mr. Gregory, who takes a
place in the front rank of Australian explorers, and had the gold
medal of the Royal Geographical Society conferred on him in 1858,
did not take part in any further expeditions, being appointed
Surveyor-General of Queensland in 1859, a post which he held till
Sept. 1st, 1879. He was created C.M.G. in 1874, a trustee of the
Queensland Museum in 1876, and was nominated to the Legislative
Council in Nov. 1882; but did not take his seat till June 1883. Mr.

where he was in the Survey Office, he accompanied his brother
Augustus in his first exploring expedition in 1846. In 1858 he
organised au expedition to examine the country between the Gascoyne
and Mount Murchison, in West Australia. A million acres of good
land was discovered, and the party returned to Adelaide in July
1861. In the same year he tried to explore the interior from the
north-west coast; but the sand ridges barred his way, and he and
his party narrowly escaped destruction. As it was, they discovered
good country and new rivers. Mr. Gregory went to reside in
Queensland in 1862, and was nominated to the Legislative Council in
1874. He acted for some time as Surveyor-General in Western
Australia, was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Geographical
Society in 1863, and was joint-author with his brother of "Journals
of Australian Explorations" (Brisbane, 1884). He married at
Ipswich, Queensland, on May 11th, 1865, Marion Scott, daughter of
the late Alexander Hume. On Sept. 25th, 1883, he succeeded Mr.
Morehead as Postmaster-General in the first McIlwraith Ministry.

popular Australian comedian, was born in Dublin on June 15th, 1834,
in which city he began his theatrical career. Arriving during the
"gold fever" in Victoria in 1852, he soon left the pick and shovel
for the sock and buskin,&mdash;a phrase which is used literally,
for, strange as it may appear, Mr. Greville in those days essayed
Othello. His real career began, however, when he joined Mr. George
Coppin as stage manager at Cremorne. After this Mr. Greville was an
established favourite, and for the last thirty years has been
constantly before the public. His wife (<i>née</i> Marshall) was at
one time a popular actress.</p>

<p><a name="A582" id="A582"></a><b>Grey, Sir George</b>, K.C.B.,
M.H.R., D.C.L., LL.D., sometime Governor and Premier of New
Zealand, is descended from a branch of the Greys of Groby,
Marquises and subsequently Dukes of Dorset, and now represented in
the peerage by the Earl of Stamford. He is the son of the late
Lieut.-Colonel Grey of the 30th Foot, who was killed at the
storming of Badajos, in the Peninsular War, was born on April 14th,
1812, at Lisbon, and educated at Sandhurst for the army. In 1829 he
was made ensign in the 83rd Foot, becoming lieutenant in 1833 and
captain in 1839, when he sold his commission. In 1837, in company
with Lieut. Lushington, he was employed on an exploring expedition
to the north-west of Australia, the object being to survey the
country between Swan River and the Gulf of Carpentaria. They sailed
from Plymouth in H.M.S. <i>Beagle</i>, and landed at the Cape of
Good Hope, where they hired the schooner <i>Lynher</i> to convey
them to Western Australia, landing in Port George on Dec. 2nd,
1837. There, after severe hardships, in the midst of which Grey
showed great gallantry and endurance, they were rescued just in the
nick of time by the <i>Lynher</i>. Ultimately a sheltered cove was
discovered, and named Hanover Bay, from which point a fresh start
inland was made on Jan. 17th, 1838. Hostile natives were
encountered, and Grey received three spear-wounds (from the effects
of which he still suffers), and was compelled to abandon the
exploration of the Swan River. Making a <i>détour</i> inland, they
discovered beautiful tropical country, and traced the course of the
Glenelg River for seventy miles. On April 16th the party returned
to Hanover Bay, and subsequently embarked on board of the
<i>Lynher</i> for Mauritius, where Grey spent some time in
recruiting his health. In 1839 he returned, and again started on an
exploring expedition into the interior with thirteen men, the
object being to survey the coast between Sharks Bay and Freemantle.
A storm, however, arose, and washed away their provisions, and
there was nothing for it but to put back to Perth, a distance of
six hundred miles. The men, however, when they had got half way,
refused to proceed in the leaky craft, and landing, gave themselves
up for lost. And lost they would have been but for the pluck of
their leader, who left them at a well, and pushed on to Perth, from
whence he sent succour, which arrived just in time. The rescued
remnant reached Perth on April 21st, 1839, in a wretched plight,
and Grey departed for Adelaide <i>en route</i> for England, where
his admirable "Journals of Discovery" were published. On April
15th, 1841, he returned to Adelaide with a commission (given him in
the previous December) to replace Colonel Gawler in the government
of the settlement, the latter having "outrun the constable" in
promoting the development of the colony, and had his bills
dishonoured by the Home Government, when he drew upon them to
defray the cost of the works which he had started. By a rigid
system of economy, not very pleasant for those whose position was
affected by it, Captain Grey restored the balance of the finances
and gained the good opinion of the Colonial Office to such a
degree, that in 1845 he was appointed Governor of New Zealand,
where even greater difficulties awaited him&mdash;difficulties
which the imperial authorities relied (not in vain) upon his
courage and statesmanship to surmount. Lord Stanley (afterwards
Earl of Derby) showed his acumen in selecting him to succeed
Governor Fitzroy (<i>q.v.</i>). Sir George arrived at Auckland on
Nov. 14th. A short time previously Kororarika had been sacked by
the chiefs Heke and Kawiti, who were at open war with the
Government; but, by his judicious treatment of the neutral chiefs,
and his vigorous operations against the rebels, Captain Grey
succeeded in quelling the revolt. During the remainder of his term
of office he had continual difficulties with the Maoris to settle,
and was also involved in difficulty in regard to the grants of land
to missionaries. On Nov. 29th, 1848, he issued an "Ordinance to
provide for the establishment of Provincial Legislative Councils"
as a preliminary to the granting of representative government to
the colony. He desired to establish a Legislative Council, elected
by the provincial councils, and an Assembly elected by the people:
unicameral Provincial Councils, of which one-third should be
nominated by the Crown and two-thirds elected; municipal
corporations, with a £10 burgess and £5 rural suffrage for
Europeans who could write and read and a suffrage for Maoris owning
property worth £200. On Dec. 19th he appointed six members of the
Legislative Council of New Munster. But this action roused the
hostility of the colonists, who decried it as a piece of
"absolutism," and in 1849 a "Settlers' Constitutional Association"
was formed, including amongst its members Mr. (afterwards Sir)
William Fitzherbert, Mr. (now Sir) William Fox, Dr. Featherston,
and Mr. (afterwards Sir) Frederick Weld. Earl Grey, however,
supported the Governor's action, and on Dec. 22nd, 1849, the royal
approval of the Ordinance was given. The discontent in the colony
increased; Mr. Godley joined the agitation; and Mr. Fox sought an
interview with the Colonial Secretary to protest. In Feb. 1852 Lord
John Russell's Government went out of office; and Sir John
Pakington, who succeeded Lord Grey at the Colonial Office, brought
in a bill in May by which six provinces were created in New
Zealand&mdash;namely, Auckland, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury,
Otago, and New Plymouth. On Jan. 17th, 1853, Sir George Grey
proclaimed this Constitution Act, and on Feb. 28th he defined the
limits of the provinces which had been left to his discretion, and
made other regulations as to Crown lands, superintending
registration of elections, etc. In 1849 he had persuaded the Home
Government not to deport convicts to New Zealand. In Dec 1853 he
left the colony, at first merely on leave of absence, but was
appointed Governor of the Cape in 1854. There he exhibited
extraordinary administrative and military capacity, breaking the
back of a threatened Kaffir uprising of very dangerous proportions
by his diplomatic skill, and on his own responsibility sending
troops and money to India during the mutiny. The latter incident is
thus described by an evidently well-informed writer: "In 1857,
while Governor of Cape Colony, he was called upon by Lord
Elphinstone, then Governor of Bombay, to assist in the defence of
the British Empire in India; and it so happened that just at this
time a part of Lord Elgin's army, on their way to Canton to punish
the Chinese, touched at Cape Town. These Sir George Grey, on his
own authority, directed to Calcutta, two days only after receiving
Lord Elphinstone's letters, together with a part of the artillery
stationed there, fully horsed, and transmitted from the Cape
Treasury £60,000 in specie, continuing to forward both men and
horses. Knowing the cavalry and artillery must be supplied, he
dismounted his own cavalry and artillery, even taking the horses
from his own carriage to keep up the supply. Vast stores of food
for men and horses he also provided, and sent on a quantity of
ammunition. All this Sir George Grey did without any authority from
the Imperial Government, and so quickly that the troops which
enabled Lord Elphinstone to hold the mutineers in check at Bombay,
and Sir Colin Campbell to relieve Lucknow on Nov. 17th, 1857, were
largely drawn from the forces sent by Sir George from the Cape."
Colonel Gore Browne had succeeded him in New Zealand, but the
native troubles developing, in May 1861 Sir George Grey was
recalled to his old colony to settle the difficulty. He resumed the
Government of New Zealand for the second time on Oct. 3rd, 1861,
and at once set about his task of reorganising native affairs. A
system of administration by <i>runangas</i> (or native councils)
was to be introduced throughout the Maori country. The new plan was
welcomed by the loyal natives and many others, but despite all the
Governor's efforts, the Waikato chiefs stood aloof. Moreover, his
endeavours to settle the Waitara block dispute were unsuccessful.
At this time (1862) the Duke of Newcastle consented to the
devolution of the control of native affairs from the Governor upon
his responsible ministry, and Sir George Grey declared his
intention of acting in these matters upon the advice of his
ministers. On April 22nd, 1864, Sir George recommended the
abandonment of the Waitara block, and on May 11th this was
officially proclaimed. Unhappily, however, owing to the delay
caused by the reluctance of the Ministry, the concession came too
late, and war was inevitable. A party of English were murdered at
Oakura, and on July 12th General Cameron crossed the Maungatawhiri,
and the Waikato war began. During the whole of this campaign the
Governor was involved in disputes with his Ministry, at one time in
regard to the Waitara blocks, at another as to the treatment of
prisoners and the confiscation of rebel lands. After the close of
the Waikato war, in Dec. 1864, the Governor issued a confiscation
proclamation. The war had now spread to the Wanganui region, and
Sir George Grey instructed General Cameron to attack Wereroa Pa,
but the latter declined, alleging that he would require 2000 extra
soldiers. Sir George then assembled a force of 500 men, friendly
natives and forest rangers, and personally conducted an assault
upon the <i>pa</i>, which was taken on July 20th, 1865. This
incident was the occasion of a quarrel between the Governor and
General Cameron, in which the Home Government espoused the cause of
the latter, who had accused the Governor of countenancing
subversion of discipline. Subsequently, in General Chute's famous
Taranaki campaign, an unfortunate dispute arose in connection with
the shooting of a prisoner of war. Colonel Weare, an officer under
General Chute, had charged the Governor and his Government with
urging Chute to take no prisoners alive. Sir George indignantly
denied this, and Lord Carnarvon, at the Colonial Office, while
accepting his denial, rebuked him for the tone of his despatches,
and requested him to withdraw them. This Sir George refused to do.
At this juncture Mr. Disraeli's Government went out of office, and
the Duke of Buckingham succeeded Lord Carnarvon. But this change
made no difference to the position of Sir George Grey, who would
seem to have become obnoxious to the Colonial Office. On August
27th, 1867, he was recalled, and Parliament immediately adjourned
as a mark of respect for the Governor and regret at his recall. On
Sept. 6th an address from the Houses was presented to him, in which
the hope was expressed that the Queen would reward him for his
services by some signal mark of honour. On Sept. 16th the Ministry
drew up a formal protest against the treatment to which Sir George
Grey had been subjected, and regretting the discourteous recall of
the Governor, expressed their sympathy with him. In reply to the
Duke of Buckingham's comments on this document, Sir George Grey
wrote: "I request your Grace to be pleased to state to the Queen
that I present my duty to Her Majesty, and in receiving this
notification of my Sovereign's pleasure, I beg to be permitted
humbly to represent to Her Majesty that in the year 1845, a
rebellion prevailing in New Zealand, I was, by Her Majesty's
commands, especially sent to this country, and that when I
relinquished the post in the year 1854 it was my happiness to leave
it in a state of tranquillity and prosperity; that in the year
1861, a rebellion having again broken out in New Zealand, I was
once more especially sent here; and that it is again my happiness,
upon being removed, by your Grace's advice, from this Government,
to leave New Zealand in a state of tranquillity and returning
prosperity; and that I humbly represent to Her Majesty that I
desire to claim no merit for these circumstances, but rather to
attribute them to the blessing of Divine Providence, and to the
abilities and exertions of Her Majesty's subjects who have advised
me and aided me in my duties; and further, that I humbly trust that
the almost unanimous voice of Her Majesty's subjects in New
Zealand, amongst whom I have laboured In Her Majesty's service,
will satisfy Her Majesty that I have done my utmost to promote the
welfare and happiness of the inhabitants of this part of Her
Majesty's possessions." Sir George Bowen assumed office as Governor
on Feb. 5th, 1868, and at the end of the year Sir George Grey left
New Zealand to put himself right at the Colonial Office in respect
of the Weare charges. Lord Granville, however, who had become
Colonial Secretary, refused to reopen the subject, and he was
retired on a pension in 1872. In the interim Sir George Grey
delivered addresses at the leading centres of population in the
United Kingdom, in opposition to the policy then advocated by
several prominent statesmen of getting rid of the colonies, and
became a candidate for West Worcestershire and Newark, retiring in
each case before the poll. Having returned to New Zealand, and
taken up his residence in the island of Kawau, Sir George, in 1875,
was elected member of the House of Representatives for Auckland
City West, and also in the same year superintendent of the Province
of Auckland. At this time he came forward as an ardent upholder of
provincialism when the Houses had decided to abolish the provinces.
He also brought forward a Manhood Suffrage Bill and a Triennial
Parliaments Bill, both of which were rejected. In Oct. 1877 the
Atkinson Ministry was defeated, and on the 13th Sir George Grey
formed a cabinet, thus ruling as Premier a country which, ten years
before, he had ruled as Governor. The beginning of the ministry's
term of office was marked by a dispute with the Governor (Lord
Normanby) on a question of privilege. On July 29th, 1879, on a
motion by Sir W. Fox, the Government was defeated, and after the
election which followed was again put in a minority, on a motion by
Mr. (afterwards Sir) John Hall. Sir George Grey, who resigned
office in Oct 1879, sat in Parliament continuously up to the
election in Nov. 1890, when he did not offer himself. The degree of
D.C.L. was conferred upon him by the University of Oxford in 1854,
and he was created K.C.B. in 1848. He married, in 1889, Harriet,
daughter of the late Admiral Sir R. W. Spencer, K.H., formerly
Government Resident of Albany, West Australia. Sir George Grey has
lately given his valuable library as a free gift to the town of
Auckland. He was one of the three delegates of New Zealand to the
Federation Convention held in Sydney in March 1891, having been in
the meantime re-elected to the House of Representatives for Newton.
At the Convention he stood almost alone in his advocacy of the "one
man one vote" principle as the condition precedent of federation.
He also argued in favour of the Governor-in-Chief of the projected
commonwealth being chosen by popular election. After the sittings
of the Convention closed Sir George Grey revisited South Australia,
where the fiftieth anniversary of his assumption of the government
of that colony was celebrated with extraordinary demonstrations of
regard and respect. At all the leading centres in South Australia,
Victoria, and New South Wales Sir George addressed gatherings in
favour of the "one man one vote" principle, gaining an overwhelming
preponderance of popular support. His Life by Mr. W. L. Rees,
M.H.R., has lately been published by Messrs. Hutchinson, London;
and Mr. Brett, Auckland.</p>

<p><a name="A583" id="A583"></a><b>Griffith, Charles James</b>,
M.A., was the fifth son of Richard Griffith, of Millicent, Kildare,
Ireland (sometime member for the borough of Askeaton in the Irish
Parliament), by his second wife, Mary, daughter of Right Hon.
Walter Hussey Burgh, Lord Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer; and
was half-brother of Sir Richard John Griffith, Bart., the author of
the famous "valuation" of Ireland. He was educated at Dublin
University, and was called to the Irish bar. He emigrated to
Victoria in 1840, and was appointed, by Governor Latrobe, chairman
of the Board of Commissioners of Sewers and Water Supply, and in
this capacity took a prominent part in the construction of the
works for bringing the water supply of the City of Melbourne from
Yan Yean, a distance of nineteen miles. Mr. Griffith also took an
active part in the erection and establishment of the Melbourne
Church of England Grammar School, the foundation-stone of which was
laid in 1856. He was also a prominent member of the Church Synod.
He married Miss Jane Magee. Mr. Griffith was engaged in pastoral
pursuits, and was appointed a nominee non-official member of the
first Legislative Council of Victoria on Nov. 3rd, 1851. After the
concession of responsible government he was returned to the first
Legislative Assembly for the district of Dundas and Follett. At the
meeting of parliament he was a candidate for the Speakership, but
was beaten by Mr. (afterwards Sir) Francis Murphy. Mr. Griffith was
the author of a work published in Dublin in 1845, entitled
"Position and Prospects of the Port Phillip District of New South
Wales." He died in Melbourne in 1863.</p>

<p><a name="A584" id="A584"></a><b>Griffith, Hon. Sir Samuel
Walker</b>, K.C.M.G., M.A., Premier of Queensland, is the son of
the late Rev. Edward Griffith, formerly Congregational minister at
Merthyr Tydvil in South Wales, but for many years residing in
Brisbane, and was born at Merthyr on June 21st, 1845. In 1854 Sir
Samuel Griffith's family emigrated to the colony of which he is now
Premier, but which was then only the Moreton Bay district of New
South Wales; settling first at Ipswich, then at Maitland, and
finally at Brisbane. Sir Samuel was educated in the first instance
under Mr. Horniman at Sydney, and subsequently at the High School,
West Maitland, of which the Rev. W. McIntyre was head master. In
1860 he proceeded to Sydney University, graduating B.A. in 1863 and
M.A. in 1870. He early selected a legal career as his future
<i>rôle</i>, and was called to the bar at Brisbane in 1867. In 1870
he married Julia Janet, daughter of Mr. James Thomson, for some
time Commissioner of Crown Lands at Maitland. Sir Samuel Griffith
soon obtained a considerable legal practice, and in 1872 entered
Parliament as member for East Moreton. The district being
subdivided in 1873, Sir Samuel was returned for the Oxley portion,
which he continued to represent till 1878, when he was elected for
the metropolitan constituency of Brisbane, which he has since
represented. In August 1874 Sir Samuel was appointed
Attorney-General in the Macalister Ministry [becoming Q.C. in
1876], and continued to hold office under the subsequent
Administrations of Messrs. Thorn and Douglas, with the additional
portfolio of Minister of Education, and subsequently as Minister of
Public Works, until Jan. 1879. In his first session he originated
the Telegraphic Messages Bill, a measure which provided for the
transmission by of all legal processes and other documentary matter
requiring authentication. This was successfully carried, and in
1874, whilst still outside the charmed circle of the Cabinet, he
introduced and carried an Insolvency Bill. The latter measure was
based in its general principles upon the English Act of 1869, but
included a great many provisions since embodied in Mr.
Chamberlain's recent Act. It also contained clauses against
fraudulent preference, which are asserted to be the most stringent
in force in any part of the world. In 1875, whilst
Attorney-General, Sir Samuel Griffith introduced a ministerial
measure for the adoption of a free, secular and compulsory system
of State education. This was successfully carried, and he assumed
charge of the department formed under the statute. At this period,
too, he participated in carrying Judicature and Local Government
Acts. In 1879 the McIlwraith Government came into power, and
continued to hold sway till 1883, when, mainly through the
exertions of Sir Samuel Griffith, they were ejected from office,
and a large majority returned in opposition to their policy
regarding the importation of coolie labour for the purpose of
working the northern sugar plantations, and their proposals for the
construction of the Queensland transcontinental railway on the land
grant system. In Nov. 1883 Sir Samuel became Premier, and in the
following years carried a Land Act and measures for the regulation
of the Polynesian labour trade, which largely mitigated the evils
of a system which nearly approached the horrors of the African
slave traffic. The Defence Act passed by the first Griffith
Ministry contributed to the national security; and they also
succeeded in carrying a Licensing Act, which embodied the principle
of local option without compensation. Sir Samuel followed the
policy of his predecessor in reference to Australian Federation,
and was a prominent member of the Convention which met at Sydney in
1883; the drafting of the Federal Council Bill, which ultimately
passed the Imperial Parliament, being confided to his hands. When
the Federal Council held its first sitting at Hobart, Sir Samuel
was appointed first Chairman of the Standing Committee, and was
subsequently elected President. During the Queensland parliamentary
session of 1886 Sir Samuel passed an Act which codified the entire
body of law relating to the duties and powers of justices of the
peace. His Offenders' Probation Act was also a piece of advanced
legislation. In 1887 Sir Samuel was associated with Sir James
Garrick in the representation of Queensland at the Colonial
Conference held in London in that year, and took a prominent and
successful part in its proceedings. At the Conference he proposed a
resolution, which was carried, affirming the desirableness of
preferential treatment of British products throughout the British
dominions. At the general election in the spring of 1888 the
supporters of the Griffith Government were placed in a minority,
and they accordingly resigned in June. After leading the Opposition
to the McIlwraith and Morehead Ministries until August 1890, the
latter resigned, and the Governor invited Sir Samuel Griffith to
form a second Administration, which he succeeded in doing in
combination with his former opponent, Sir Thomas McIlwraith, and
still holds office as Premier. Sir Samuel was one of the
representatives of Queensland at the Intercolonial Federation
Conference held in Melbourne in 1890, and at the Sydney Convention
of 1891. Of the latter body he was unanimously appointed
Vice-Chairman. He has occupied for a number of years the leading
position at the bar in Queensland. In 1889, while in opposition, he
introduced, and succeeded in passing, a codification of the law of
defamation, and also passed through the Assembly an Eight Hours
Bill, which, however, was defeated in the Legislative Council. In
the following year, being still in opposition, he introduced a Bill
to declare the natural law relating to the acquisition and
ownership of private property, the fundamental principle of which
is that the products of labour (whether of mind or body) belong of
right to the persons who have contributed to their production
(including the possession of the property to which the labour is
applied) and belong to them in proportion to the value of their
respective contributions. He maintains that this principle is the
only alternative to the rule that each man shall get and keep as
much as he can from neighbour. This Bill, which was intended to be
followed by another to define the procedure for assessing the value
of the contributions of the several contributors to production,
attracted some attention, but has not yet become law. On the whole
Sir Samuel Griffith must be regarded as having occupied the premier
position at the Federation Convention of 1891, the Commonwealth
Bill being virtually drafted by him, though he received valuable
assistance from Messrs. Barton, Deakin, Clark, and Kingston, and
the measure was somewhat modified by the Convention sitting as a
whole. Early in 1892 Sir Samuel Griffith astonished the world by
announcing his conversion to the necessity of renewing the
importation of Kanaka labour for the cultivation of the sugar
plantations of Northern Queensland for a further period of ten
years. He also announced the intention of the Government to
encourage the construction of railways on the land grant system. In
the former case his plea was that he could not allow the sugar
interest to be ruined at the bidding of labour combinations which,
whilst opposed to the importation of coloured labour, would not
permit of the plantation work being done by white hands. As
regarded the land grant railways, he justified his change of
opinion on the ground that it was now impossible to borrow money on
the English market for the construction of lines necessary for the
development of the country. Measures for the effectuation of the
policy thus announced were carried in the session of 1892, and
though there has been a huge outcry alike from
pseudo-philanthropists and genuine enthusiasts against the renewal
of the Kanaka labour traffic, Sir Samuel Griffith relies on the
strict enforcement of the more stringent regulations now enacted
for the prevention of the evils which were prevalent prior to the
revision of the system in 1884.</p>

1853. In 1868 he accompanied the <i>Challenger</i> Expedition to
the South Seas, and subsequently cultivated a sugar and tobacco
estate In Queensland. In 1873 he accented the appointment of
Director of the Melbourne Botanic Gardens, a position he still
holds. Mr. Guilfoyle has written several works on botanical
subjects, and has contributed copiously to the scientific
journals.</p>

<p><a name="A592" id="A592"></a><b>Gullett, Henry</b>, the
well-known Australian journalist, is the son of an old colonist in
the Lancefield district of Victoria, and early embraced journalism
as a profession. He is best known as the editor for many years of
the Melbourne <i>Australasian</i>, a high-class weekly journal,
published in connection with the daily <i>Argus</i>, in the conduct
of which he succeeded Mr. James Smith. Mr. Gullett, who is an
admirable writer, imparted a high literary and critical tone to the
paper, and placed it in the front rank of its class as a family
political and sporting newspaper for the intelligent classes. In
1885 he severed his connection with the <i>Australasian</i> and
removed to Sydney, where he became a proprietor of the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i>, editor of the weekly journal, the <i>Tribune</i>,
published in connection therewith, and a constant contributor to
the leading columns of the former. In 1890 he resigned his literary
connection with the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and is now engaged as a
leader-writer and assistant editor on the <i>Sydney Morning
Herald</i>. Mrs. Gullett has contributed largely to the journals
with which her husband has been connected, mainly on topics of
feminine interest.</p>

F.R.S., F.L.S., son of William Gunn, of Caithness, Scotland,
lieutenant in the 93rd Highlanders, and Margaret his wife (nee
Wilson), was born at the Cape of Good Hope April 4th, 1808. In 1829
he emigrated to Tasmania. He arrived at Hobart in Feb. 1830, and
was at once appointed by Governor Arthur to a post in the Convict
Department. He was appointed Superintendent of Convicts for the
Northern Division in 1830, magistrate for the Territory in 1833,
police magistrate at Circular Head in 1836, assistant police
magistrate at Hobart Town in 1838, private secretary to Governor
Sir John Franklin and clerk to the Executive and Legislative
Councils in 1839, and retired from the public service in 1841. In
1855 he was elected a member of the old Legislative Council for
Launceston, and on the introduction of free institutions in 1856 he
entered the House of Assembly, and sat for some years as member for
the district of Selby. In 1860 he received the appointment of
Deputy Commissioner of Crown Lands and Clerk of the Peace at
Launceston, and in 1865 that of Deputy Recorder of Titles at
Launceston under the Real Property Act, holding the office until
1876, when he retired on a pension. In 1868 he was one of three
commissioners appointed at the request of the New Zealand
Government by the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria, and
Tasmania, to decide on the most suitable site on Cook Straits for
the capital, the commissioners unanimously making choice of
Wellington. It was by his work as a naturalist that Mr. Gunn was
best known. He was an able and enthusiastic botanist, and in his
botanical excursions, beginning in 1831, he rambled over nearly
every part of the island, discovering many new species of plants,
and adding largely to the knowledge of the flora of the colony. The
results of his labours are recorded in Hooker's "Flora of
Tasmania," and in many articles contributed by him to scientific
journals. He was editor of the <i>Tasmanian Journal of Natural
Science</i> (Hobart Town, 1842-9). He died at Newstead, Launceston,
on March 13th, 1881. Mr. Gunn married first at Antigua, West
Indies, in 1826, Eliza, daughter of James Ireland, lieutenant 93rd
Highlanders; secondly, at Glen Leith, near New Norfolk, Tasmania,
Margaret Legrand, only daughter of David Jamieson, of Glen
Leith.</p>

M.D., was born at Amsterdam, Holland, May 31st, 1825, and landed in
Sydney, N.S.W., in May 1852. Shortly afterwards he commenced
practice as an allopathic physician, and was appointed analytical
chemist to the Government of New South Wales. In 1854 he visited
New Caledonia, and claims to have been the first European who set
foot there. His companions, nine in number were killed and eaten by
the natives; and Dr. Günst only saved himself by hiding in the
mountains till he was taken off by a passing vessel, after several,
months of exposure, danger, and suffering. After practising his
profession, combined with sugar growing on the Clarence and
Richmond rivers in New South Wales, he went with an exploration
party to Madagascar, and on his return through Paris was decorated
with the cross of the Legion of Honour. Having abandoned allopathy,
he has practised as a homoeopathic physician in Melbourne for
upwards of twenty years.</p>

Feb. 1817 as chief clerk of the Supreme Court, with Judge (Barron)
Field, the friend of Charles Lamb. He was born in Sydney on March
31st, 1819, and at the latter end of 1834 became a clerk in the
Supreme Court Office at Sydney. Having resigned that appointment,
he was in March 1841 admitted to practise as a solicitor in New
South Wales. In 1841 he was appointed deputy registrar of the
Supreme Court of New South Wales for the Port Phillip district, and
accompanied Judge Willis to what is now Victoria. Mr. Gurner was
the first person admitted as a solicitor in Melbourne; this was on
May 9th, 1841, and in October of the same year he resigned his
appointment as deputy registrar, entering upon the active practice
of his profession as an attorney in Melbourne. In Jan. 1842 he was
appointed to the office of Crown solicitor and clerk of the peace
at Port Phillip, and in Sept. 1842 was made first town clerk of
Melbourne, under the Act incorporating the town. In July 1851, upon
the separation of Port Phillip from New South Wales, Mr. Gurner
became Crown solicitor of the colony of Victoria, a post which he
held for some twenty years. In 1841 he published the "Rules and
Orders of the Supreme Court of New South Wales for the District of
Port Phillip," in 1871 the "Practice of the Criminal Law of the
Colony of Victoria," and in 1876 "Chronicles of Port Phillip." He

Mathias Haas, in Bonn, Germany, was born on May 1st, 1824, and
educated at the schools of Bonn and Cologne, and at the University
of Bonn. At college he devoted himself to geological studies, and
for some years resided in France. In 1858 he arrived in Auckland,
N.Z., and accompanied Dr. Hochstetter in his tour through the
colony. Being employed by the authorities of Nelson to explore the
western and southern parts of the province, he made many geological
and topographical discoveries in that region, and a report of his
explorations was printed by the Government. In 1861 he was
appointed Provincial Geologist of Canterbury, and made numerous
scientific expeditions into the unknown uplands and into Westland,
the results being embodied afterwards in a volume on the geology of
the provinces of Westland and Canterbury. In recognition of these
services the Royal University of Tubingen granted him the degree of
Doctor of Philosophy in 1862, and he was made a Fellow of the Royal
Society in 1867. Dr. von Haast was instrumental in founding the
Canterbury Museum in Christchurch, which has the reputation of
being the finest in the southern hemisphere, and of which he was
director down to the time of his death. In 1872 he joined in
founding the Canterbury Collegiate Union, from which sprang
Canterbury College, in affiliation to the New Zealand University,
of which he was a Fellow and a member of the Senate. From its
foundation till his death Dr. von Haast was Professor of Geology
and Palaeontology in Canterbury College. In 1862 he founded the
Philosophical Institute of Canterbury. In 1884 he received the gold
medal of the Royal Geographical Society, the first bestowed for
exploration in New Zealand. In 1886 he went to England as
Commissioner for New Zealand at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition,
and in the same year was created K.C.M.G., having previously been
C.M.G. He died after his return to New Zealand, on August 15th,
1887. Sir Julius von Haast married in 1863 Mary, daughter of Edward

University, and in Jan. 1864 went to New Zealand as minister of
Trinity Congregational Church, Christchurch, a position which he
held till July 1878. From Jan. 1877 to May 1878 he was Secretary to

<p><a name="A600" id="A600"></a><b>Hack, John Barton</b>, one of
the pioneer colonists of South Australia, was the descendant of one
William Hack, who died at Froyle, Hants, in 1699, and was the son
of Stephen Hack, banker, of Chichester in Sussex, by his marriage
with Maria Barton, sister of Bernard Barton, the Quaker poet and
friend of Charles Lamb. Mrs. Hack was the author of "Grecian
Stories," "English Stories," and other works, which had a large
circulation in their day. John Barton Hack was born at Chichester
on July 2nd, 1805. Having decided to emigrate, he first went to the
Cape, and thence to Tasmania, proceeding to South Australia in Feb.
1837, three months after the colony was founded. From Tasmania he
brought a considerable number of sheep and cattle in the ship
<i>Isabella</i>, which he chartered for the purpose, and which was
commanded by Captain John Hart, afterwards several times premier of
South Australia. There was great difficulty in securing suitable
land for farming operations, owing to the backward state of the
Government surveys; but ultimately Mr. Hack took up a property at
Mount Barker, most of his stock having in the meantime perished.
Having considerable capital, he engaged in commercial pursuits, and
became probably the principal merchant in Adelaide. In the meantime
he carried on his agricultural operations at Mount Barker, opened a
dairy farm at Yankalilla, and associated himself with the South
Australian Company in whale fisheries at Encounter Bay. The whaling
was conducted under the supervision of Captain Hart, but involved
Mr. Hack in heavy pecuniary losses. His ruin was completed in the
financial crisis which resulted from the dishonour of Governor
Gawler's drafts on the Home Government. Most of the business
residents were in his debt, and he was mixed up in government
contracts and transactions. Mr. Hack was the first colonist of
South Australia to take out special surveys of land&mdash;viz., at
Little Para and the Three Brothers, near Echunga. He was one of the
committee appointed to name the streets of Adelaide, and purchased
sixty-four acres at the first Government sale of town lands, so
that had he been able to retain his property he would have become
one of the wealthiest men in Australia. As it was, he had to begin
life over again, and was much handicapped in the race. When the
Burra mines were opened he started as a carrier between the capital
and the mines, and then took the position of mercantile manager in
a solicitor's office. In 1852 he went to the Victorian diggings,
and was fairly successful. Returning to Adelaide, he embraced
various employments, and then purchased a station on the Coorong,
which also proved a failure. After further vicissitudes he was, in
1870, appointed accountant in the goods department of the
Government Railways. When the Goods and Traffic departments were
amalgamated he became assistant accountant, later on accountant,
and finally accountant and comptroller of all railway accounts.
This position he held until his retirement, owing to failing
health, in June 1883. Mr. Hack married at Hardshaw, Lancashire, on
July 9th, 1829, Bridget, daughter of William Watson and Martha his
wife, who died in 1881. He died at the Semaphore on Oct 4th, 1884.
His brother, Stephen Hack, who shared his misfortunes, did some
valuable exploring work under the South Australian Government. One
of Mr. J. B. Hack's sons, Mr. Theodore Hack, was elected a member
of the Legislative Assembly in 1890; and a granddaughter, Miss Guli
Hack, daughter of his son, Charles, was the winner of the Elder
Scholarship to the Royal College of Music, where she greatly
distinguished herself.</p>

Melbourne, and entered into the political controversies of the day
as a strong Liberal on the land question, contesting Sandridge in
that interest against Dr. Madden. Removing to Western Australia he
became part-proprietor of the <i>Western Australian</i> published
in Perth. When responsible government was conceded, at the end of
1890, he was nominated a member of the new Legislative Council, and
one of the Western Australian delegates at the Federation

some time simultaneously Assistant-Secretary of the Statistical
Society of London, and of the Institute of Actuaries of Great
Britain and Ireland. He also assisted to edit the <i>Journal of the
Statistical Society</i>, and wrote on statistical subjects in
several London journals. Leaving England at the age of twenty-four,
he arrived in Victoria in Dec. 1863; under engagement to the
proprietors of the <i>Argus</i>, of which he was first a
contributor and afterwards sub-editor. He was appointed editor of
the <i>Australasian</i> early in 1865, and editor of the
<i>Argus</i>, a position which he still holds. On Jan. 1st, 1867,
Mr. Haddon visited India, the continent of Europe, and England in
1874, returning to Australia by way of America. He revisited
England in 1879 on account of ill-health, and was requested to
informally champion the views of the Victorian Constitutional party
in influential quarters at home, in opposition to the Berry
embassy, which was then in London. In pursuance of this object, he
interviewed nearly all the leading British statesmen and
metropolitan editors, wrote letters to the <i>Times</i> and other
journals, and published a pamphlet giving a history of the
Constitutional difficulty in Victoria, which was laid before the
British Cabinet and sent to every member of both Houses of
Parliament, and the editor of every political newspaper in Great
Britain. Mr. Haddon returned to Victoria after the conclusion of
the embassy, in 1879. He has been twice married.</p>

<p><a name="A603" id="A603"></a><b>Hadfield, Right Rev.

of Joseph Hadfield, of Bonchurch, Isle of Wight, was born in 1816,
and matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, on Feb. 19th, 1832,
but was obliged to leave the University because of ill-health. He
proceeded to Australia, and while in deacon's orders accompanied
the Bishop (Broughton) of Australia to New Zealand in 1838 in
H.M.S. <i>Pelorus</i>. Upon the application of Rauparaha for a
missionary to be sent to Otaki, in Cook Straits, Mr. Hadfield
volunteered. He was accordingly admitted to priest's orders by the
Bishop, and sailed with Rev. Henry Williams to Port Nicholson. Here
he settled and laboured for many years. In 1843, after the
slaughter of Captain Wakefield and others by Rauparaha, at Wairau,
that chief roused his tribe to arms to prevent the enslaving of the
Maori race, and had it not been for the intervention of Mr.
Hadfield and Te Rangitake, the Ngatitoa would have descended upon
the new settlement of Wellington. Later in 1859-60 he protested
against the treatment of Te Rangitake by the Government over the
Waitara affair, and in April 1860 sent a petition, signed at Otaki
by the Maoris, praying for the removal of Governor Browne on
account of the seizure of Waitara. This he was accused of having
inspired, but was able to show that it was spontaneous on the part
of the natives. Mr. Hadfield, who was appointed by Bishop Selwyn
Archdeacon of Kapiti, remained at Otaki from 1839 to 1865. When the
Hauhau fanaticism broke out, and the missionary Volkner was
murdered, he stood to his post at the imminent risk of his life,
declaring that he was ready to lay his bones where he had so long
laboured. Archdeacon Hadfield was commissary to Bishop Selwyn for
ten years, and was subsequently commissary to the first Bishop
(Abraham) of Wellington. In Oct. 1870, upon the resignation of
Bishop Abraham, he was appointed to succeed him, the election being
by the colonial episcopate without the Queen's mandate. In 1889,
when the Bishop (Harper) of Christchurch, who was also Primate of
New Zealand, retired, Bishop Hadfield was elected to the primacy.
As there was considerable doubt as to the proper constitution of
the electing body, the validity of the election was disputed, and
Bishop Suter, of Kelson, was nominated by the dissentient party. In
the end, however, the claims of Bishop Hadfield were
acknowledged.</p>

<p><a name="A604" id="A604"></a><b>Haines, Hon. William Clarke</b>,
M.L.A., first Premier of Victoria, was born in England in 1807, and
educated for the medical profession. After practising as a surgeon
he emigrated to Victoria in 1848. Three years later, when that
colony was separated from New South Wales, he was nominated a
non-official member of the semi-elective Legislative Council then
formed. In 1854, when Mr. Foster was sacrificed by Governor Hotham
in the hope of propitiating popular favour, Mr. Haines, who had
farmed unsuccessfully near Geelong, was appointed to succeed him as
Chief Secretary, and held that position until responsible
government was conceded, when he and his colleagues resigned their
posts, with a view, as was alleged, of securing the pensions
allotted to them under the Constitution Act, in case of their being
released from office on political grounds. For this conduct they
only escaped censure in the Council by a single vote. In Dec. 1855
the Haines Government, who had been reappointed in the previous
month to their former places, as the first responsible ministry,
were defeated on Mr. Nicholson's ballot resolution, and resigned
office. Mr. Nicholson not, however, being in a position to form a
government, Mr. Haines and his colleagues were recalled, and
remained in power until March 1857, when they were defeated on a
vote of want of confidence, and Mr. (afterwards Sir) John
O'Shanassy formed a ministry, which only, however, lasted seven
weeks, a motion censuring their conduct in not having a
representative in the Upper House being carried against them on the
first night on which they met Parliament. Mr. Haines, who in the
previous year had been returned to the first Legislative Assembly
for South Grant, once more resumed the premiership with the office
of Chief Secretary, but was again defeated, and succeeded by Mr.
O'Shanassy in March 1858. He then paid a visit of three years to
Europe, and on his return, in 1861, was elected to the Assembly for
Portland. In the same year he took office under his old opponent
Mr. O'Shanassy, and acted as Treasurer from Nov. 1861 to June 1863.
Although he carried the measure granting universal suffrage, Mr.
Haines was in many respects a Conservative, opposing the ballot,
and combining with Sir John O'Shanassy in the attempt to strangle
the national system of state education. He died in 1864.</p>

daughter of the 3rd Earl of Mayo. He was born in 1811 at Alderley,
and educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A.
in 1835 and M.A. in 1838. Having been successively curate of
Tresham and Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire, he was in 1839
appointed to the incumbency of Stroud in the same county. The next
year he married Sophia, daughter of George Clode, of London, on
whose death in 1845 he resigned Stroud, and was subsequently rector
of Alderley, and then of Atworth and Wraxall in Wilts. In 1847 he
met the late Bishop Short of Adelaide at a friend's house, and the
latter persuaded him to go out to South Australia as his
archdeacon. They went out in the same ship, and landed at Adelaide
in Dec. 1847. The next year Archdeacon Hale accompanied the bishop
on a visit to Western Australia, which at that time was included in
the diocese of Adelaide. Here he married Sabina, eldest daughter of
Lieut.-Colonel Molloy, an old Peninsular and Waterloo officer. In
1850 the archdeacon established the well-known aboriginal mission
station at Poonindie, near Port Lincoln, S.A., and acted as its
superintendent till 1856, when he resigned the archdeaconry of
Adelaide on his being appointed first bishop of the newly
constituted see of Perth, W.A. After paying a second visit of some
months to Western Australia, Bishop Hale proceeded to England, and
was consecrated in the chapel of Lambeth Palace on July 25th, 1857.
He administered the diocese of Perth till 1875; when, on the
unanimous nomination of the bishops of Australia and Tasmania, he
was translated to the bishopric of Brisbane, Qd., rendered vacant
by the retirement of Dr. Tuffnell. In March 1885 Bishop Hale

later with his father, who was the first pastor of Collins Street
Baptist Chapel, Melbourne. Mr. Ham, whose eldest brother, Jabez,
was one of the first editors of the Melbourne <i>Age</i>, started
business as a land and estate agent in that city in 1855, and was
Mayor of Melbourne in 1881-2. In Nov. 1882 he stood for a seat in
the Legislative Council of Victoria in opposition to the late Dr.
Beaney and Mr. George Coppin, and was triumphantly returned, being
re-elected in 1886. Mr. Ham accepted a seat in the Munro Ministry
without portfolio in Nov. 1890, and was sworn of the Executive
Council. Twelve months later he resigned office after voting
against the Government Bill establishing the one man one vote
principle, but resumed office on the measure being abandoned. In
Feb. 1892, however, when the Ministry was reconstructed under Mr.
Shiels, he left the Cabinet. He married in 1868 Hattie, daughter of
John Latham, of West Virginia, U.S.A., formerly United States
Consul-General in Melbourne.</p>

<p><a name="A611" id="A611"></a><b>Hamilton, Edward William
Terrick</b>, is the second son of Anthony Hamilton, Archdeacon of
Taunton and Rector of Loughton, Essex, by Charity Graeme, his wife,
third daughter of Sir Walter Farquhar, Bart. He is the younger
brother of the late Bishop of Salisbury, and was born in 1809. He
was educated at Eton, and Trinity College, Cambridge (of which he
was Fellow), B.A. (Fifth Wrangler) in 1832, and M.A. in 1835. He
was M.P. for Salisbury from 1865 to 1869. Mr. Hamilton resided in
New South Wales from 1839 to 1855. In 1844 he married Ann
Catherine, second daughter of John Thacker, of the Sydney firm of
Thacker, Daniel &amp; Co. On Jan. 20th, 1863, Mr. Hamilton was
appointed parliamentary agent in England for the colony of New
South Wales. Mr. Hamilton, on his return to England, took up his
residence at Charteris, Sunninghill, Yorks, of which county he is
J. P. and D.L.</p>

<p><a name="A612" id="A612"></a><b>Hamilton, George</b>, arrived in
Adelaide, S.A., on Oct. 1st, 1829, with cattle from Port Phillip
(now Victoria), and in 1848 was appointed second clerk in the
Colonial Treasury, afterwards undertaking the management of the
Bullion Office. In 1853 he entered the police force, and was
appointed Commissioner in 1867. This post he held till 1882, when
he retired. He was the originator of the Adelaide Club, and died on
August 3rd, 1883.</p>

<p><a name="A613" id="A613"></a><b>Hamilton, Sir Robert George
Crookshank</b>, K.C.B., M.A., LL.D., Governor of Tasmania, is a son
of the late Rev. Zachary Macaulay Hamilton, D.D., minister of
Bressay, Shetland, N.B., and grandson of Rev. Gavin Hamilton, of
Hoy, Orkney, and Helen (Macaulay), his wife, aunt of Lord Macaulay.
He was born in Shetland in 1836, and educated at Aberdeen
University, where he graduated M.A. in 1857, receiving the LL.D.
degree in 1885. He entered the Civil Service as a temporary clerk
in the War Office in 1855, and the same year was attached to the
Commissariat Department in the Crimea. On his return, in 1857, he
was employed in the Office of Works, and subsequently in the
Education Department, where he was accountant from 1861 to 1869. He
was accountant to the Board of Trade from 1869 to 1872, assistant
secretary from 1872 to 1878, secretary to the Civil Service Inquiry
Commission from 1874 to 1875, and accountant-general of the Navy
from 1878 to 1882. In May of the latter year Lord North brook
appointed him Under-Secretary to the Admiralty; but he had scarcely
entered upon his duties, when he was called on to take the place of
the murdered Mr. Burke, as Acting Under-Secretary for Ireland,
which position he retained until April 1883, when he was made
Under-Secretary, retaining the position till Nov. 1886, when he was
appointed Governor of Tasmania. Sir Robert Hamilton, who was made
K.C.B. in 1884, had, as a result of his official experiences,
become a convert to Home Rule, and it was felt to be an anomaly
that he should continue in office under a Unionist Administration.
Hence his transfer to the Colonial Service. Sir Robert at different
times took a leading part in the reorganisation of various
departments of the English Civil Service, and in 1879 served on the
Royal Commission to inquire into the condition of colonial
defences. He married first, in 1863, Caroline, daughter of
Frederick A. Geary (who died in 1875); and secondly, in 1877,
Teresa Felicia, daughter of Major Reynolds, 57th Regiment, who long
resided at Hobartville, Richmond, N.S.W. He was appointed Governor
of Tasmania in Dec. 1886, and entered on the duties of his office
in March 1887. Sir Robert was one of the patrons of the Melbourne
Centennial Exhibition in 1888.</p>

<p><a name="A614" id="A614"></a><b>Hamilton, Rev. R.</b>, M.A.,
D.D., arrived in Victoria from Scotland in 1851, and almost
immediately took up the pastorate of the Fitzroy Presbyterian
Church, which position he held until 1883, when he retired from
active ministry. Dr. Hamilton was well known as an advocate of the
Second Advent doctrine, upon which subject he wrote and published
several books, but he was best known amongst Presbyterians for his
"History of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria," and for this he
received the degree of D.D. The welfare of the aborigines occupied
a prominent place in his thoughts, and many years ago he selected a
tract of land at Healesville which he dedicated to their benefit.
He died in 1891, at the age of seventy-eight.</p>

senior officer in command of the Imperial troops in the colony of
South Australia on the death of Governor Sir Dominic Daly, on Feb.
19th, 1868. The next day he was sworn in as Administrator of the
Government of the Colony, and remained Chief of the Executive till
the arrival of Sir James Fergusson on Feb. 15th, 1869. He was then
only lieut.-colonel. General Hamley died in London on Jan. 12th,

<p><a name="A616" id="A616"></a><b>Hampton, John Stephen</b>,
sometime Governor, Western Australia, was in the Medical Department
of the Royal Navy, and came out to Van Diemen's Land in 1843, in
the convict ship <i>Constant</i>, of which he was
surgeon-superintendent. On arrival he took part with the opponents
of Governor Sir John Eardley Wilmot. He was appointed
Comptroller-General of Convicts in Van Diemen's Land in succession
to Captain Forster, and was subsequently censured, with other
officials, by the local executive for having derived profit from
the labours of prisoners through utilising some trifling articles
of convict manufacture. On the Legislative Council in 1855
appointing a select committee to inquire into the administration of
the Convict Department, Mr. Hampton refused to appear before it,
and the Governor, Sir Henry Young, declined to order his
attendance, on the ground that the penal establishments were under
Imperial control. The Council declared him "in contempt," and
ordered the serjeant-at-arms to arrest him. Mr. Hampton threatened
to resist forcibly, but ultimately allowed the warrant to be
executed, on Sept. 15th. A writ of habeas corpus was taken out, but
the Council still insisted that Hampton should appear at their bar,
which he declined to do. The Governor thereupon prorogued the
Council, with the result that the Speaker's warrant lapsed, and the
Supreme Court in the meantime decided that the proceedings against
Hampton were illegal, and that the Council had erred in assuming
general parliamentary privilege. Mr. Hampton, having obtained leave
of absence, visited Sydney, and went thence to England, the Court
of Appeal affirming, in Feb. 1858, the judgment in his favour
delivered by the Tasmanian Court. Mr. Hampton was favourably
received by the Colonial Office, and in 1862 (Feb. 27th) was
appointed Governor of Western Australia, the only one of the
Australian colonies to which transportation was still permitted.
Mr. Hampton quitted the government in Nov. 1868, and transportation
was suspended the same year. He died on Dec. 1st, 1869.</p>

<p><a name="A621" id="A621"></a><b>Hanson, Hon. Sir Richard
Davies</b>, sometime Chief Justice of South Australia, was the
second son of R. Hanson, and was born in St. Botolph's Lane,
London, where his father was a fruit merchant and importer, on Dec.
6th, 1805. He was educated at a private school at Melbourne, in
Cambridgeshire, and was admitted an attorney and solicitor in
London in 1828. From 1830 to 1834 he co-operated with Mr.
(afterwards Sir) George Kingston, Mr. (afterwards Sir) John
Morphett, Mr. John Brown, and others, in promoting Mr. Wakefield's
scheme for the colonisation of South Australia, and addressed
meetings in its favour, until legislative sanction was at last
given in the latter year. He contributed to the <i>Globe</i> and
<i>Morning Chronicle</i>, and was appointed by Lord Durham
Assistant Commissioner to inquire into Crown Lands and Immigration
in Canada. In this capacity he accompanied Lord Durham to that
colony, and conducted an investigation, the results of which were
subsequently embodied in a report signed by the late Charles
Buller, as head of the Commission, and laid before Parliament. On
the death of Lord Durham, to whom he had acted as private
secretary, in 1840, Mr. Hanson went with the first contingent of
settlers to Port Nicholson (Wellington), N.Z., where he was one of
the council appointed by the colonists to control the
administration of justice in the infant community. British
sovereignty was subsequently formally proclaimed, and at the end of
1841 Mr. Hanson was appointed Crown Prosecutor at Wellington. He
also edited the <i>New Zealand Colonist</i>. Five years later he
resigned that post, and settled in South Australia, where he
practised at the Adelaide bar. In 1851 he was returned to the
partially elective Legislative Council for Yatala; but before he
could take his seat he was appointed Advocate-General, and thus
became an official member of the Council. In Oct. 1856 he was
appointed Attorney-General, and held the post under responsible
government till August 1857. In March of that year he was returned
to the Assembly for the city of Adelaide, and held the seat till
his appointment to the bench in Nov. 1861. In Sept. 1857 Mr. Hanson
became Premier of South Australia, with the portfolio of
Attorney-General, and held office till May 1860. When Sir Charles
Cooper, the first Chief Justice of the colony, retired in the next
year, Mr. Hanson was appointed his successor. In 1869 he revisited
England, and was knighted by the Queen in July. From Dec. 1872 to
June 1873 he administered the government from the departure of Sir
James Fergusson to the arrival of Sir Anthony Musgrave. In the
following year, when the University of Adelaide was constituted, he
was elected the first Chancellor, and held the office until his
death on March 4th, 1876. Trained in Nonconformity (it being
asserted that he was a pupil of the late Thomas Binney), Sir
Richard was thoroughly in accord with the principles of civil and
religions freedom which inspired the founders of South Australia,
and only accepted the position of Advocate-General in 1851 on the
understanding that he was permitted complete liberty of action in
regard to the vexed question of State aid to religion. Voting
against his official colleagues, he formed one of the triumphant
majority which put an end to the grant in South Australia. In 1852
he passed the District Councils Act, which formed the basis of all
subsequent measures of local self-government in the colony. He also
carried the first act adopted in the Australian colonies for
legalising marriage with a deceased wife's sister, and introduced
the measure, since copied in England and the other colonies,
abolishing the public execution of criminals. He at first opposed
the Torrens Real Property Act, but directly the principle had been
affirmed by the South Australian Legislature he exerted his utmost
endeavours to effectuate its operation. It should have been
premised that Sir Richard took a prominent part in the agitation
for securing responsible government for South Australia, and
drafted the act under which it was granted in 1856. He was the
author of "Law in Nature, and other Papers read before the Adelaide
Philosophical Society" (1865), "The Jesus of History" (Williams
&amp; Norgate, 1869), "Letters to and from Rome" (Williams &amp;
Norgate, 1869), and "The Apostle Paul and the Preaching of
Christianity in the Primitive Church" (1875). In all of these works
the criticisms of modern rationalism were applied to the miraculous
narratives of the Biblical writers.</p>

soon left the ministry to join the staff of the <i>South Australian
Register</i>. Subsequently he became editor of the
<i>Advertiser</i>&mdash;a position which he held till his death. He
was commissioned by the Government to compile an account of the
colony, which was published by Messrs. Sampson Low &amp; Co., under
the title "South Australia: its History, Resources and

transportation, and sat in the Mixed Legislative Council for West
Torrens from July 1851 to June 1854, when he resigned. In Jan. 1855
he was appointed a Commissioner for effectuating the wishes of
Parliament in relation to the Adelaide and Gawler Railway Bill. In
March 1857 he was elected to the first Legislative Assembly for
Yatala, but resigned in the following May, on being appointed
Superintendent of the Stockade. Mr. Hare became Manager of Railways
in succession to Mr. Drake, in July 1860, but was removed from
office in May 1865, in consequence of an accident to a train
carrying the Governor and Ministry, for which a Commission of
Inquiry held him culpable. After an experience of several years as
a planter in Fiji, Mr. Hare returned to South Australia and managed
a mine near Moonta. In 1875 he was an unsuccessful candidate for
the representation of the latter district in the Assembly, his
defeat being due to his opposition to the men's demands during the
great Moonta strike, in 1874. Mr. Hare met with better success in
1878, and represented the district till 1880, when he resigned and
revisited England, returning to South Australia in the following

<p><a name="A626" id="A626"></a><b>Hargrave, His Honour the Hon.
John Fletcher</b>, M.A., sometime Puisne Judge, New South Wales,
was the eldest son of Joshua S. Hargrave, an ironmonger in
Greenwich, where he was born on Dec. 28th, 1815. His father was a
prominent Wesleyan, and he was educated in the tenets of that
denomination. Going to London University when fourteen, he won a
first-class certificate of honour for rhetoric in 1831; and was an
intimate friend of the late Dr. Woolley, afterwards Principal of
Sydney University. In the autumn of 1831 Mr. Hargrave became one of
the first students at King's College, London, and in 1833
matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A
(Senior Optime) in 1837, and M.A. in 1840. In Sept. 1836 he entered
as a student at Lincoln's Inn, and in Jan. 1841 he was called to
the bar. In the same year he published a treatise on the Thellusson
Act and on "Trusts for Accumulations"; and in 1843 he edited the
first volume of the 21st editon of "Blackstone's Commentaries." Mr.
Hargrave, who married, on Sept. 20th, 1843, his cousin Ann,
daughter of William Hargrave, of Woodhouse, Leeds, practised in
London at the equity bar until 1856, when he decided to emigrate to
Australia, arriving in Sydney in Feb. 1857. He was shortly
afterwards appointed a District Court Judge and Chairman of Quarter
Sessions; but resigned this position with a view to entering
political life, being appointed Solicitor-General in the Cowper
Ministry, in succession to Mr. Dalley, in Feb. 1859. He was
immediately returned to the Legislative Assembly for East Camden,
and at the general election, a few months later, for Wollongong. He
retired with his colleagues in the Cowper Ministry in Oct. 1859,
and a few days later was reappointed Solicitor-General in Mr.
Forster's Government, but without a seat in the Cabinet, which
only, however, held office till March 1860, when, after another
interval of a few weeks, Mr. Hargrave again accepted office as
Attorney-General in the Robertson Ministry. Having been in the
meantime nominated to the Legislative Council, Mr. Hargrave acted
as the representative of the Government in the Upper House till Jan
1861, when Mr. Robertson transferred the premiership to Mr. Cowper,
under whom Mr. Hargrave continued to act as leader of the
Legislative Council and Attorney-General until July 1863, when he
resigned the latter post to Mr. (afterwards Sir) J. B. Darvall, his
senior in politics and at the bar, and took the inferior post of
Solicitor-General&mdash;still, however, retaining the leadership of
the Upper House. In Oct. 1863 the Cowper Government broke up, and
Mr. Hargrave was out of office till Feb. 1865, when he acted as
Solicitor-General in Mr. Cowper's fourth administration until
October of the same year, when he was appointed to a seat on the
Supreme Court bench, in succession to the late Mr. Justice Milford.
Mr. Hargrave, during his parliamentary career, piloted several
important measures of legislation through the Upper
House&mdash;notably the State-aid to Religion Abolition Act; and
was associated with Mr. (now Sir) John Robertson in the conduct of
business in that Chamber during the stormy proceedings in
connection with the Land Act of 1861. Judge Hargrave, soon after
his elevation to the bench, became Primary Judge in Equity; and in
July 1873 was appointed First Judge of the Divorce Court. From 1858
to 1865 he acted as Reader on General Jurisprudence to the
University of Sydney. He died on Feb. 23rd, 1885.</p>

<p><a name="A627" id="A627"></a><b>Hargraves, Edward Hammond</b>,
was born at Gosport, England, on Oct. 7th, 1816, and educated at
Brighton Grammar School, and afterwards at Lewes. He emigrated to
New South Wales in 1832, and in the next year explored Torres
Straits in search of <i>bêche de mer</i> and tortoise-shell.
Returning to Sydney in 1834, Mr. Hargraves was engaged in pastoral
pursuits till 1849, when he went to California, where he was struck
with the similarity of the geological formation of the gold areas
to that of Bathurst, N.S.W. On his return to that colony, in 1851,
he justified his impressions by discovering gold at Lewis Ponds
Creek, near Bathurst, on Feb. 12th of that year. Though Count
Strzelecki and the Rev. W. B. Clarke had preceded him in the
discovery, and recent evidence tends to show that to others
belonged the credit of the actual find in Feb. 1851, Mr. Hargraves
was the first to make the existence of gold in quantity known to
the world at large, and was thus the recipient of the main honours
and rewards offered by the Colonial Governments for the discovery
of the precious metal. In 1853 he visited England, and was
presented to the Queen as the discoverer of gold in Australia. In
the same year the Parliament of New South Wales voted him £10,000,
that of Victoria £2381 in 1855, and the Parliament of New South
Wales a pension of £250 in 1877. He at one time visited Western
Australia, at the request of the Government, to search for the
precious metal there, but the experiment did not prove a success.
He died on Oct. 30th, 1891. Just about the time of his death other
claimants to the honour of having found the first gold sprang up,
and the New South Wales Assembly appointed a select committee to
inquire into the claims of William and James Toms and J. H. A.
Lister as the first discoverers of gold in Australia. The report
stated that although E. H. Hargraves was entitled to the credit of
having taught the claimants, the Tomses and Lister, the use of the
dish and cradle and other proper methods of searching for gold, the
committee were satisfied that the Tomses and Lister were
undoubtedly the first discoverers of payable gold. These men, after
persistent search under great difficulties, unearthed four ounces
of the precious metal in April, 1851. This was handed to Hargraves,
who thus obtained a reward of £10,000 from the New South Wales
Government, upwards of £2,300 from the Victorian Government, and a
pension of £250 a year as the first discoverer. Hargraves, it is
stated, had abandoned the search for gold when the four ounces was
handed to him. Considering the great impulse the discovery gave to
the progress of the colony, the claims of the Tomses and Lister
were, it was urged, worthy of favourable consideration. Lister died
subsequently to the appointment of the committee, but left a
written statement of facts.</p>

he was at the age of thirteen apprenticed to a chemist at
Harrogate. On the termination of his apprenticeship he was for some
time dispensing assistant to a surgeon at Leeds, and subsequently
carried on business as a chemist at Prescot, near Liverpool, where
he was treasurer of the local Anti-Corn Law League. He married
early in 1845, and left England for Victoria at the end of that
year, arriving in Feb. 1846. He bought property on the Yarra which
he farmed until 1850, when he started as a grain and produce
merchant in Melbourne. In 1856 Mr. Harker retired from business,
and was returned to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for
Collingwood. He was Treasurer in the second O'Shanassy Ministry
from March 1858 to Oct. 1859, when he resigned with his colleagues.
At the general election which took place just previously, he was
defeated at Collingwood, but was returned for Maldon. Quickly
resigning his seat for the latter constituency, he revisited
England, where he remained for two years. On his return he was
re-elected for Collingwood, which he represented intermittently
during the rest of his public career. Mr. Harker held many
important public positions and died on April 5th, 1879.</p>

Chitty</b>, D.D., formerly Bishop of Christchurch and Primate of
New Zealand, is the son of the late Tristram Harper, of Gosport,
where he was born in 1807. He was educated at Hyde Abbey School,
Winchester, and Queen's College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in
1826, M.A. in 1840, and was Michel Fellow, being made D.D. in 1856.
He was ordained deacon by the Bishop of Rochester in 1831, and

private tutor at Eton, and from 1832 to 1840 was "conduct," or
chaplain, of that college. In 1840 he became vicar of
Stratfield-Mortimer, Berks, and remained there until 1856, in the
August of which year he was consecrated first Bishop of
Christchurch, N.Z., by Archbishop Sumner, of Canterbury, and
Bishops Wilberforce, of Oxford, and Gilbert, of Gloucester,
arriving in New Zealand in December. In 1869, upon the resignation
of Bishop Selwyn, Bishop Harper was elected by the General Synod
Primate of New Zealand. In 1889 he resigned the bishopric, and
Archdeacon Churchill Julius, of Ballarat, was elected to succeed
him. Bishop Harper is warden of Christ College, and governor of
Canterbury College.</p>

<p><a name="A631" id="A631"></a><b>Harpur, Charles</b>, one of the
best-known poets of Australia, was born at Windsor, on the
Hawkesbury river, in New South Wales, in 1812. He published a small
collection of sonnets, and some years afterwards a volume of
miscellaneous poems. In 1850 he married Mary, eldest daughter of
Mr. E. Doyle, of Jerey's Plains. In 1858 he was appointed Gold
Commissioner at Araluen, but the office was abolished in 1866. A
year afterwards his son was accidentally shot, and he never
recovered the shock, dying on June 10th, 1868.</p>

<p><a name="A632" id="A632"></a><b>Harris, Rev. Richard Deodatus
Poulett</b>, son of Captain Charles Poulett Harris, of the 60th
Rifles, was born at Cape Breton Island on Oct. 26th, 1817. The
family traces descent in a direct line from Sir Amias Poulett, of
Queen Elizabeth's time. Mr. Harris was educated by his father, and
at Manchester Free Grammar School, and afterwards at Trinity
College, Cambridge, where he graduated as Twenty-fourth Wrangler in
1843. He was Principal of the Huddersfield College in 1844; took
orders in 1846, and was classical master of Blackheath Proprietary
School in 1849. In 1856, having received the appointment of Rector
of the High School of Hobart Town, Mr. Harris went to Tasmania.
During his Rectorship of the High School, which lasted twenty-eight
years, he was a most successful head master, and trained a number
of the most prominent Tasmanian public men. At the suggestion of
Mr. Harris, the Tasmanian Parliament in 1858 passed an Act
establishing a system of examinations on the plan of the Oxford and
Cambridge local examinations, and founding two annual scholarships
for Tasmanian youths of £200 per annum, tenable at any of the
universities of the United Kingdom. The Tasmanian Council of
Education and Scholarship Act had a most important effect in
raising the standard of education in the colony. Mr. Harris was one
of the original members of the Council of Education appointed by
the Government in 1859. He remained a member until the absorption
of the Council in the new Tasmanian University. He had long been a
warm advocate of the establishment of a university in the colony,
and on its foundation in 1890 he was unanimously elected first
Warden of the Senate. Mr. Harris has a distinguished Masonic
record. He has twice been First Principal of the Royal Arch Chapter
in Tasmania. In June 1880 he was appointed District Master for
Tasmania. In 1890, on the establishment of a Grand Lodge of
Tasmania, Mr. Harris was installed first Grand Master, the Grand
Masters of other colonies&mdash;Lord Carrington, Lord Kintore,
Chief Justice Way, and other distinguished Masons&mdash;coming to
Hobart to take part in his installation. In 1885 Mr. Harris
resigned the Rectorship of the High School, and has since resided
at Peppermint Bay, Dentrecasteaux Channel.</p>

<p><a name="A633" id="A633"></a><b>Hart, Hon. Frederic
Hamilton</b>, M.L.C., was born at Madras, on March 26th, 1836, and
received his education in the Australian colonies. He first came to
Sydney in 1843 with his father, the late William Hamilton Hart, who
was superintendent of the Bank of Australasia, and who, as a member
of Sir Charles Hotham's Secret Commission in 1854, did immense
service in reconstituting the disordered finances of Victoria. The
father and son revisited England in 1849, returning to Australia in
1853, when they took up their residence in Melbourne, and the
former established the firm of Bright Brothers &amp; Co., the son
acting as junior clerk. In 1862 he was sent to open a branch of the
firm in Queensland, arriving in Brisbane in September of that year.
In 1881 the designation of the firm of which Mr. Hart is still the
resident managing partner in Queensland was altered to Gibbs,
Bright &amp; Co. He was appointed a member of the Marine Board or
Queensland in 1869, and subsequently vice-chairman. In 1872 he took
an active part in the formation of the Queensland National Bank,
and was elected director at the first meeting of shareholders and
became first chairman of the Board, a position he has held
continuously ever since. In July 1872 he was summoned to the
Legislative Council.</p>

<p><a name="A634" id="A634"></a><b>Hart, Hon. John</b>, C.M.G.,
sometime Premier of South Australia, was born in 1809, and went to
sea, ultimately becoming a captain in the merchant service. In
1835, the year before South Australia was founded, he established a
whaling station at Encounter Bay, and subsequently traded between
South Australia, Van Diemen's Land, and England. In 1846 he
abandoned the sea, and settled at Port Adelaide, where he started
flour mills. He was returned to the first Legislative Assembly, in
1857, for Port Adelaide, and sat for that constituency till 1859,
and again, from 1862 to 1866, when he resigned. He was member for
Light from 1868 to 1870, and for the Burra from that year until his
death in 1873. He was Treasurer in Mr. Baker's Ministry from August
to Sept. 1857, and In the Hanson Government from September of that
year to June 1858. He was Chief Secretary in the Dutton Ministry
for a few days in July 1863, and Treasurer in the first and second
Ayers and first Blyth Ministries from that date till March 1865.
Mr. Hart was three times Premier of the colony&mdash;viz., from
Oct. 1865 to March 1866, from Sept. to Oct. 1868, and from May 1870
to Nov. 1871; on the two first occasions with the office of Chief
Secretary, and on the last with that of Treasurer. Mr. Hart, who
was created C.M.G., fell down dead whilst attempting to address a
meeting of the Marine Insurance Company in Adelaide on Jan. 28th,
1873.</p>

B.A., B.Sc., Inspector-General of Schools, South Australia, son of
the Rev. John Hartley, Governor of the Wesleyan College,
Handsworth, Birmingham, was educated at Woodhouse Grove School,
near Leeds, and University College, London. He graduated as B.A. of
London 1868, B.Sc. 1870, and in 1871 was appointed Head Master of
Prince Alfred College, Adelaide. While holding this position he
became a member of the Central Board of Education, and was for a
time its chairman. On the passing of the Education Act in 1875, he
was offered the position of President of the Council of Education,
and his time was then devoted entirely to the Government business.
On the dissolution of the Council at the end of 1878, he was
appointed Inspector-General of Schools, and in this capacity he has
effected many reforms in the local system of public education. He
is the author of a number of textbooks specially prepared for the
schools under his management, and edits the <i>Education
Gazette</i> for the colony and a juvenile paper, <i>The Children's
Hour</i>. Mr. Hartley has been a member of the Council of the
University of Adelaide since its establishment in 1874.</p>

<p><a name="A639" id="A639"></a><b>Haultain, Hon. Colonel Theodore
Minet</b>, M.L.C., New Zealand, who is of Dutch extraction, was
born in May 1817, at Stony Stratford, England, and after a coarse
at Sandhurst entered the army in 1834. He served ten years in
India, being at Ferozepore and Maharajpore in 1842-3. In 1849,
while Staff-officer of Pensioners, he went out to New Zealand in
charge of the 8th division of the New Zealand Fencibles. In 1856 he
retired from the army, settling at Mangare, and in 1859 he was
elected to the House of Representatives. In the following year he
was employed by the Government to organise the Auckland Militia,
and was appointed lieut.-colonel of the 1st battalion. In 1863 he
was given command of the 2nd Waikato Regiment in the Waikato war,
and was present at the taking of Orakau. For his services he was
promoted to be colonel, and made colonel-commandant of the four
Waikato regiments. In 1865 he resigned his post, having been
elected to the House to represent Franklin. When the Weld Ministry
was defeated, Mr. Stafford formed a cabinet, and Colonel Haultain
acted as a member of the Executive Council from Oct. 16th, 1865, to
June 28th, 1869, and Minister for Colonial Defence from Oct 31st,
1865, to June 28th, 1869. During his period of office occurred the
Hauhau wars, and the affairs of Te Kooti and Titokowaru, and he
personally conducted the Whakamarama campaign. In 1869 Colonel
Haultain retired from public life, but in 1871 he drew up a report
on the working of the Native Lands Act, and in 1872 was entrusted
with the payment of imperial pensions, and was made Trust
Commissioner under the Native Lands Fraud Prevention Act. He was
subsequently sheriff, and is a trustee and governor of St. John's
College, Auckland, and a governor of Auckland College. In June 1885
he was the colony's representative in Sydney to welcome back the
New South Wales Soudan contingent.</p>

<p><a name="A640" id="A640"></a><b>Hawker, Hon. George Charles</b>,
M.P., M.A., second son of a distinguished naval officer, the late
Admiral Hawker, was born in London on Feb. 21st, 1818. Having been
educated on the Continent and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where
he graduated B.A. in 1840 and MA. in 1854, he emigrated to South
Australia in Sept. of the former year, and embarked in pastoral
pursuits. He entered the Assembly for the district of Victoria in
1858, and sat till the dissolution in 1865, when he retired with
the view of returning to England, where he remained, with the
exception of a short visit which he paid to the colony in 1868,
until 1874. When Parliament met in April 1860, Mr. Hawker was
elected Speaker of the Assembly in opposition to Mr. Finnis, the
Treasurer, and the late Mr. Francis Dutton. He was unanimously
re-elected to the Chair of the House on the meeting of the next
Parliament, in Feb. 1863, and held the office till the dissolution
in 1865, when he left for England. On his return he was re-elected
to the Assembly for Victoria, and sat uninterruptedly from 1875 to
1882. During this period he was Treasurer in the Blyth Ministry
from 25th May to 3rd June, 1875; Chief Secretary under Mr. Boucaut
from March to June of the following year, and Commissioner of
Public Works under the same gentleman, and under the two succeeding
Morgan Ministries, from Oct. 1877 to June 1881. For some years past
Mr. Hawker has represented North Adelaide in the Assembly, and in
1882 he received Her Majesty's permission to bear the title of
"Honourable" within the Colony of South Australia. He was married
at Adelaide on Dec. 16th, 1845, to Miss Bessie Seymour.</p>

<p><a name="A641" id="A641"></a><b>Hay, Hon. Alexander</b>, M.L.C.,
was member for Gumeracha in the Legislative Assembly of South
Australia from 1857 to 1861 and from 1867 to 1870, and for East
Torrens in 1870-71. Whilst sitting in the Lower House, he was
Commissioner of Public Works in Mr. Reynolds' two Governments from
May 1860 to Oct. 1861. He has since 1883 held a seat in the
Legislative Council, and was a member of the South Australian
Commission for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in 1886. Mr. Hay
was Treasurer of the Executive Council of the University
Association, which organised the establishment of the Adelaide
University, in 1872.</p>

<p><a name="A642" id="A642"></a><b>Hay, Ebenezer Storry</b>, was
born at Kilsyth, Scotland, and practised as a solicitor in Dunedin,
N.Z. He was a well-known contributor of verses to the Otago papers,
and is the author of a pamphlet entitled "Some Characteristics of
Wordsworth's Poetry and their Lessons for us: an Essay and some
Poems by Fleta" (Dunedin, N.Z., 1881). He died at Dunedin by his
own hand, at the age of thirty-seven, on April 20th, 1887.</p>

<p><a name="A643" id="A643"></a><b>Hay, Hon. Sir John</b>,
K.C.M.G., M.L.C., late President of the Legislative Council of New
South Wales, was the son of the late John Hay, of Little Ythsie,
Aberdeenshire, and was born in June 1816. He was educated at King's
College, Aberdeen, where he had a brilliant career and took his
degree in 1834. After studying for the legal profession in
Edinburgh, he decided to emigrate to Australia, arriving in Sydney
in 1828, when he settled as a squatter at Walaregang, on the Upper
Murray. He was engaged in pastoral pursuits in this locality until
1867, but in the meantime found leisure to devote considerable
attention to politics, being returned unopposed to the first
Legislative Assembly of New South Wales under responsible
government, for the Murrumbidgee district, in 1856. In September of
that year he moved the vote of want of confidence in the Cowper
Ministry which compelled their retirement from office, and was sent
for by the Governor to form an alternative Administration. This,
however, he declined to do, and recommended that recourse should be
had to Mr. (afterwards Sir) H. Watson Parker, who succeeded in
forming a Cabinet, in which Mr. Hay accepted the post of Minister
of Lands and Works. In Sept. 1857 Mr. (afterwards Sir Charles)
Cowper had his revenge, the Parker Ministry being thrown out on an
amendment which he moved to the second reading of their Electoral
Bill. Mr. Hay represented the Murrumbidgee in the Assembly till
April 1859. He sat for the Murray till Nov. 1864, when he was
elected for Central Cumberland, which he represented till he left
the Assembly. In Parliament he strongly opposed the Selection
before Survey clause of the Land Act of 1861; and a hostile
amendment, which he carried in the Assembly in Oct. 1860, was the
cause of an appeal to the constituencies, which resulted in a large
majority being obtained for Mr. Robertson's proposals. Later on he
supported the Fencing Bill, as likely "to take the sting out of
Free Selection." From Oct. 1862 to Oct. 1865, Mr. Hay held the
position of Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, when, finding the
duties too onerous, he resigned. In June 1867 he was nominated to
the Legislative Council, and on the death of Sir Terence Aubrey
Murray, in July 1873, was appointed President, a position he held
till his death. He was created K.C.M.G. in 1877, and was Chairman
of the Mercantile Bank of Sydney. He died in 1891. Sir John married
in Feb. 1838 Mary, daughter of James Chalmers and Mary his
wife.</p>

<p><a name="A644" id="A644"></a><b>Hayter, Henry Heylyn</b>,
C.M.G., son of the late Henry Hayter of Eden Vale, Wilts, and
nephew of the late Sir William Goodenough Hayter, Bart., was born
in 1821, at Eden Vale, Wilts, and received his education in Paris,
and afterwards at the Charterhouse, where he was contemporary with
Sir George F. Bowen and the late Sir Charles Du Cane. He emigrated
to Victoria in 1852, and in 1857 joined the department of the
Registrar-General, where he was for many years at the head of the
statistical branch. In 1870 he was appointed Secretary to a Royal
Commission appointed to inquire into the working of the Public
Service of Victoria, which sat for upwards of three years, and
brought up an exhaustive report, on the recommendations of which
the present Public Service Act has been based, and in which the
commissioners expressed their high sense of the value of Mr.
Hayter's services. Meantime he directed the arrangements for the
census of 1871. In the following year he was granted a short leave
of absence, which he spent in New Zealand; and while there, at the
request of the Government of that colony, he investigated the
Registrar-General's department, and made suggestions for the better
taking of the census, all of which were adopted. In May 1874 the
statistical branch over which Mr. Hayter had so long presided was
constituted a separate department, and he was placed at its head
with the title of Government Statist, and he soon afterwards
originated the <i>Victorian Year-Book</i>, a work which has made
his name a household word far beyond the confines of the colony. In
1875 Mr. Hayter was deputed to represent Victoria at a conference
of the Australasian colonies, held in Tasmania, for the purpose of
establishing a uniform system of official statistics; the result
being that the Victorian plans and methods were in almost every
case adopted. In 1879 he visited the United Kingdom as Secretary to
the famous "embassy," of which Mr. (now Sir) Graham Berry and
Professor (now Dr.) Pearson were members, and whilst in London was
twice examined before a committee of the House of Commons appointed
to inquire into and make suggestions for reorganising the system of
collecting and compiling the statistics of the United Kingdom. This
committee in its report spoke of Mr. Hayter as having brought the
statistical system of Victoria "to an unusually perfect condition."
On his return to Victoria he made arrangements for taking the
census of 1881, which, as well as the compilation of the returns,
he afterwards carried out successfully. In 1890 he contemplated
retiring from office; but, at the special request of his
Government, he consented to remain, first to represent Victoria at
an intercolonial statistical conference held in Tasmania, of which
he was elected president, and secondly to conduct the operations of
the Victorian census of 1891, which was successfully taken under
his management. He was awarded a silver medal at the Melbourne
Exhibition of 1875, a silver and a bronze medal at that of 1880, a
gold and a bronze medal at that of 1888-9, a gold medal at the
Amsterdam Exhibition of 1881, a silver medal at the Calcutta
Exhibition of 1884, a bronze medal at the Colonial and Indian
Exhibition of 1887, a first-class award at the Adelaide Exhibition
of 1887, and a <i>grand prix</i> (diploma and medal) at the Paris
Exhibition of 1889, for his statistical publications. Besides the
<i>Victorian Year-Book</i>, Mr. Hayter is the author of "Notes of a
Tour in New Zealand"; "Notes on the Colony of
Victoria&mdash;Historical, Meteorological, Geographical, and
Statistical," a portion of which has been reprinted for use in the
Victorian State Schools; a "Handbook to the Colony of Victoria,"
40,000 copies of which have been distributed in England and
elsewhere; a "Nosological Index," now used in the Statistical
departments of all the Australian colonies, a volume of poems, and
numerous statistical reports. In 1877 he edited "Précis of
Information on the Colony of Victoria and its Capabilities for
Defence," for use in the Imperial War Office. Mr. Hayter is an
honorary member of numerous scientific societies in Europe and the
colonies, to which he has frequently contributed papers. He was
created a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George on
May 24th, 1882, an officer of the French Order of Public
Instruction on July 14th, 1882, and a Chevalier of the Order of the
Crown of Italy on July 17th, 1884. Mr. Hayter married, in 1855,
Susan, daughter of the late William Dodd, of Porchester Terrace,
London.</p>

<p><a name="A645" id="A645"></a><b>Heales, Hon. Richard</b>,
M.L.A., sometime Premier of Victoria, was the son of an ironmonger,
and was apprenticed to a coachmaker. He was born in London, and,
having married, emigrated to Victoria with his father in 1842. At
first he worked as a journeyman coachbuilder, but soon became
proprietor of the establishment in which he had been employed. In
1849 he was elected to the Melbourne City Council for Gipps Ward,
and then paid a visit to England, which lasted from 1852 to 1855,
during which he made himself prominent as an advocate of the
Temperance cause. Responsible government having been conceded, he
was elected to the Assembly for East Bourke in 1857, and became the
leader of the advanced liberal party. In Nov. 1860 the Nicholson
Ministry were defeated by a somewhat incongruous majority, which
subsequently put forward Mr. Heales for the premiership, which he
assumed in conjunction with the office of Chief Secretary. His
Cabinet included such strong names as those of Ireland, Verdon, J.
M. Grant, and others; and Mr. Heales sketched out a democratic
programme which included payment or members, reform of the Upper
House, and protection to native industries, all of which were
subsequently achieved after a long and arduous struggle. Finding
himself in a minority, Mr. Heales obtained a dissolution in July
1861; but his fiscal policy being distrusted, he had to make way
for Mr. (afterwards Sir) John O'Shanassy in the following November.
As a private member, Mr. Heales was able to achieve a great triumph
in the passing of a measure which he introduced for the maintenance
and establishment of common schools, and which virtually laid the
foundation of the present advanced state school system of Victoria.
This bill, which dissolved the Denominational School Board, and
vested in a new "Board of Education" the property held by the
National School Board, and rendered religions teaching optional and
separate from the secular instruction imparted, received the royal
assent in June 1862. In June of the next year Mr. Heales joined the
first McCulloch Government&mdash;the most powerful ever formed in
the colony&mdash;as Minister of Lands, subordinating his personal
claims to leadership in order to assist in the imposition of a
moderate protective tariff. He died, however, just before the
general election which strengthened their hands to propose it, and
to enter on the bitter struggle with the Upper House in which it
eventuated. His premature death took place on June 19th, 1864.</p>

<p><a name="A646" id="A646"></a><b>Heaphy, Major Charles</b>, V.C.,
the only colonist on whom the Victoria Cross was conferred for
gallantry during the Maori war troubles in New Zealand, was the son
of Thomas Heaphy, water-colour painter, who founded the Old
Watercolour Society and the Society of British Artists, and as a
young man studied at the Royal Academy, where, before he was
seventeen, he gained both a bronze and silver medal. Having
accepted a position as draughtsman to the New Zealand Company, he
left England for that colony in the ship <i>Tory</i> in May 1839.
During the first ten or twelve years after his arrival, he employed
his spare time in studying, surveying, and exploring the country,
eventually settling in Auckland, where he married a daughter of the
Rev. J. F. Churton, colonial chaplain. In 1852 he was located at
the Coromandel goldfields, and in 1855 was appointed district
surveyor at Mahurangi. At the commencement of the volunteer
movement in 1859, he joined the Auckland City Company, and rose to
be lieutenant, being afterwards elected captain of No. 3 (Parnell)
company Auckland Rifle Volunteers. When the first volunteers were
marched from Auckland to the front, in July 1863, Lieutenant Heaphy
was with the detachment which erected St. John's Redoubt at
Papatoitoi, and in Nov. he was attached to the flying column as
guide. Captain Heaphy was with Colonel Sir H. Havelock, V.C., on
Feb. 11th, 1864, reconnoitring the country near Waiari, in the
Waikato, when a party of the 40th regiment, who were bathing, were
fired upon. A number of soldiers from the adjoining camp appeared
on the scene as quickly as possible, but in some disorder, and
Colonel Havelock placed Captain Heaphy in charge of the detachment.
A soldier was seen lying near the edge of the creek, wounded and
bleeding to death, an artery having been severed. Captain Heaphy,
having some knowledge of surgery, volunteered to go to his
assistance, and having reached him, was engaged in taking up the
artery when he was fired at by a body of natives, who were
concealed in the farm close by. He was struck and slightly wounded
in three places, but nevertheless succeeded in completing his work
of humanity and, with the assistance of some soldiers, carrying off
the man. For this brave action he received the New Zealand medal
and the rank of major in the New Zealand Militia, and was
recommended for the Victoria Cross. The warrant at that time did
not, however, permit of its being awarded to any but regulars, and
it was not until after considerable delay and special legislation
in the Imperial Parliament that it was awarded to him in 1867. On
the termination of the war in the Waikato, he held office as Chief
Surveyor of Auckland. From 1869 to 1872 he represented Parnell in
the House of Representatives, and in the latter year was appointed
Commissioner of Native Reserves and a trustee under the Native
Lands Frauds Prevention Act. In 1877 he was further appointed
Commissioner of Annuities, and shortly after received a judgeship
in the Native Lands Court. At the end of 1880, finding his health
failing, he applied for his pension, which was granted in 1881; and
in very feeble health he left Wellington for Brisbane, Queensland,
to try the effect of a warmer climate. He gradually sank, however,
and died in Brisbane on August 3rd, 1881. He was the author of

<p><a name="A647" id="A647"></a><b>Hearn, Hon. William Edward</b>,
M.L.C., LL.D., the son of Rev. W. E. Hearn, vicar of Killargue, and
afterwards of Kildrumferton, co. Cavan, Ireland, was born at
Belturbet, co. Cavan, on April 21st, 1826, and educated at the
Royal School of Enniskillen, and at Trinity College, Dublin, where
he studied law In 1849, on the opening of the Queen's Colleges, he
was appointed Professor of Greek in the Queen's College, Galway,
and afterwards held the office of Examiner to the Queen's
University of Ireland. On the opening of the University of
Melbourne in 1854, Dr. Hearn was selected by a committee&mdash;of
which the late Sir John Herschel was chairman&mdash;as Professor of
Modern History, Modern Literature, Logic, and Political Economy.
Later on he became Professor of Modern History and Political
Economy alone&mdash;a post which he resigned on being appointed
Dean of the Faculty of Law. In this capacity he lectured on
Jurisprudence, Roman, Constitutional, and International Law. His
personal influence on the university students of his time has left
a deep impress on the scholarship and culture of Victoria in the
present generation. He was an indefatigable literary worker, and
besides holding for some time the position of editor of the
<i>Australasian</i>, he found time to write four important books.
Had he confined his attention to one subject, he might very
probably have attained the first rank in eminence; as it was his
active mind travelled in too many grooves. His first work was
entitled "Plutology; or, The Theory of the Efforts to Satisfy Human
Wants." This was for a long time recognised as a standard work in
political economy, and though the advance of the science has tended
to render the book obsolete, it will always have its importance in
connection with the history of the science. His next book was "The
Government of England: its Structure and Development" (1867). This
is still regarded as a unique book, being the best story of the
growth of our unwritten Constitution. In 1878 he published his
"Aryan Household: its Structure and its Development." This is an
introduction to the study of comparative jurisprudence, and
analyses the ethical conceptions of our primitive ancestors.
Lastly, in 1884 he published his "Theory of Legal Duties and
Rights," a work which was suggested by the final task to which he
devoted himself. This was the consolidation of the Victorian
statutes, a most laborious compilation, in the midst of which death
overtook him on April 23rd, 1888. In 1878 he had been returned as
representative of the Central Province in the Legislative Council.
For some years he was the recognised leader of the Council, and
took a prominent part in politics as a Constitutionalist and Free
Trader. Dr. Hearn, whose family was of Northumbrian origin, married
first, in 1847, Rose, daughter of Rev. W. J. H. Lefanu, rector of
St. Paul's, Dublin (who died in 1877), and secondly, in 1878,
Isabel, daughter of Major W. G. St. Clair.</p>

<p><a name="A648" id="A648"></a><b>Heath, Alfred</b>, J. P.,
Commissioner of Audit, South Australia, entered the Civil Service
of that colony as third clerk in the Treasury in May 1852, became
cashier in Sept. 1862, Secretary to the Minister of Education in
July 1879, and Commissioner of Audit and Auditor under the Road Act
in August 1883.</p>

<p><a name="A649" id="A649"></a><b>Heath, Commander George
Poynter</b>, R.N., was born at Hanworth, Norfolk, on June 19th,
1830, being the younger son of the Rev. Charles Heath, vicar of
Hanworth, rector of Gunton, Suffield, and rural dean, and grandson
of Dr. George Heath, head master of Eton College. He married, on
Feb. 23rd, 1860, at Trinity Church, Bayswater, Elizabeth Jane, the
eldest daughter of Capt. J. Long Innes, of H.M.'s 39th Regiment.
Entered H.M. navy as a cadet, in July 1845, on board H.M.S.
<i>Cyclops</i>, employed on the home station with the Channel
Squadron, and on the south-east coast of America. Arriving in
Sydney in June 1847, in H.M.S. <i>Rattlesnake</i>, he was employed
upon the survey of the inner route to Torres Straits and the south
coast of New Guinea, under the late Capt. Owen Stanley. Returned
again to the Australian station in H.M.S. <i>Fantome</i> he served
in H.M.S. <i>Calliope</i>, under Sir Everard Home, on the coast of
Australia, and New Zealand and in the Western Pacific. On his
return to England he was employed by the Hydrographic Office in
preparing charts of the Pacific Ocean. Suffering from an affection
of the throat, he had to retire from active service afloat, and on
the separation of Queensland from New South Wales, was appointed,
in Jan. 1860, Marine Surveyor and a member of the Pilot Board of
the new colony. In 1862 he was made Portmaster of Queensland and a
member of the Marine Board, and in 1869 Chairman of the Marine
Board. He was also for many years a member of the Immigration
Board, and latterly a member of the Defence Committee of the
colony. Capt. Heath took an active interest in Church matters, and
was for many years a member of the Diocesan Council and Chairman of
Committees of Synod. These offices, together with those of
Portmaster of the colony, Chairman of the Marine Board, and member
of the Defence Committee, he resigned in Jane 1890, when he
accepted a pension under the Civil Service Act, his health
necessitating rest and change. On commencing his duties in 1860,
shortly after the separation of the colony, there was one
lighthouse and one lightship in existence, those being in Moreton
Bay. On giving up charge in 1890, the coast was lighted by
thirty-five lighthouses, six lightships, and some one hundred and
sixty smaller lights; eighteen ports were open with a thousand
miles of buoyed and beaconed channels, including the intricate
navigation of the passage through the coral waters of the inner
route. On his leaving Queensland, he received a presentation of
plate as an evidence of the esteem and regard of the officers and
men of the department over which he had presided, and also the
thanks of the Government for his long and valuable services and for
the admirable manner in which the pilot and lighthouse services of
the colony had been organised and controlled by him.</p>

<p><a name="A650" id="A650"></a><b>Heaton, John Henniker</b>, M.P.,
was born at Rochester, Kent, on May 18th, 1848, and educated at
Kent House Grammar School and at King's College, London. At sixteen
years of age he emigrated to Australia, where he engaged in
pastoral pursuits, acquiring " colonial experience," and afterwards
became connected with the press. He returned to England in 1884. He
was one of the Commissioners for New South Wales to the Amsterdam
Exhibition in that year, and in 1885 represented Tasmania at the
Berlin International Telegraphic Conference, where he was largely
instrumental in securing a reduction in the cable charges between
England and Australia. He also interested himself in obtaining a
modicum of representative government for the colony of Mauritius,
which he had visited <i>en route</i> from Australia to England. At
the general election in Nov. 1885 Mr. Heaton was returned to the
House of Commons for the city of Canterbury in the Conservative
interest, and in the following year was re-elected unopposed.
During his Parliamentary career he has made himself prominent by
his persistent attempts to reduce the cost of postal and cable
communication between England and the colonies, India, and America.
Mainly as the result of his exertions and the powerful assistance
afforded to him by the publicity given to his contentions in the
<i>Times</i> newspaper, the reduction of the Anglo-Colonial postage
to twopence-halfpenny was brought into effect in Jan. 1891. Mr.
Heaton is now intent upon the inauguration of an universal penny
postal rate of intercommunication between all parts of the empire
and America. Recently, in conjunction with an Australian and an
English capitalist, he offered to guarantee the Imperial Government
against the annual loss (estimated by Mr. Goschen at £75,000) which
such an extension of the penny post might presumably occasion. The
offer was, however, declined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
but the change is now brought within measurable distance of
achievement, mainly owing to Mr. Heaton's indefatigable efforts.
Mr. Heaton is the author of a valuable work of reference entitled
"The Australian Dictionary of Biography and Men of the Time,"
published in 1880. Though now somewhat out of date, it must largely
form the basis of all subsequent works of a similar kind. Mr.
Heaton has also written one or two other brochures of a minor
character. In 1873 he married Rose, only daughter of S. Bennett, of
Mundarrah Towers, N.S.W.</p>

<p><a name="A651" id="A651"></a><b>Hector, Sir James</b>, K.C.M.G.,
M.D., F.R.S., F.R.G.S., F.L.S., F.G.S., etc., son of the late
Alexander Hector, Writer to the Signet, of Edinburgh, was born in
Edinburgh March 16th, 1834, and educated at Edinburgh Academy and
at the University, which he entered in 1852, taking the degree of
M.D. in 1856. While here he served as assistant under Professor
Edward Forbes and other eminent men of science. For a short time
after taking his degree, Dr. Hector acted as assistant also to Sir
James Simpson; but in March 1857 he was selected by Sir Roderick
Murchison, Director-General of the Geological Survey of Great
Britain, to accompany the Palliser expedition to the Rocky
Mountains, as surgeon and geologist. The work consumed four years,
during which time the members endured many hardships and
privations. Much of the region explored had been practically an
unknown land previously, and the results of his expedition were
embodied by Dr. Hector afterwards in a Blue Book. A leading event
was the discovery by Dr. Hector of the pass by which the
Canadian-Pacific Railway crosses the Rocky Mountains. Before his
return he examined and reported upon the coal mines of Vancouver
Island, and investigated the goldfields of British Columbia,
California, and Northern Mexico. For his geographical discoveries
the leader of the expedition was awarded the gold medal of the
Royal Geographical Society in 1861. In that year Sir Roderick
Murchison offered him the post of geologist to the Provincial
Government of Otago, N.Z., which he accepted. On arriving in New
Zealand he explored the mountainous lake regions of western and
southern Otago, as also the sounds upon the coast. In 1864 he was
appointed commissioner to make a tour of the colony and report upon
its resources, with a view to an exhibition at Dunedin. In 1865
this exhibition was held, and in it Dr. Hector was one of the
leading spirits. In this year, too, he was appointed director of
the Geological Survey of the colony&mdash;a position he has held
ever since, to the great advantage of the colony. In 1875 he
visited England, and in the following year was Executive
Commissioner for New Zealand at the International Exhibition at
Philadelphia. He was also Executive Commissioner at the Exhibitions
at Sydney in 1879, and Melbourne 1880 and 1888. For the Sydney
Exhibition Dr. Hector prepared an official handbook of New Zealand,
which is still the most convenient authority upon that colony. In
1860 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, of
the Geological Society, and of the Royal Geographical Society. In
1866 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society (London), Fellow of
the Linnæan Society, of the Zoological Society, and of the
Statistical and Mineralogical Society. He is also a corresponding
member of numerous learned societies on the Continent and in
America. He received the Lyell medal of the Geological Society in
1876 and the Royal Founders' medal from the Royal Geographical
Society in 1891. In 1874 he received the Order of the Golden Cross
from the Emperor of Germany. Sir James Hector is Director of the
Colonial Museum, Laboratory, Observatory, and the Botanic Gardens.
He was chief founder, and is now Director, of the New Zealand
Institute, and is Chancellor of the University of New Zealand. He
was created C.M.G. in 1875, and K.C.M.G. in 1887. Sir James Hector
married, in 1868, the eldest daughter of the late Sir David Monro,
M.D.</p>

<p><a name="A652" id="A652"></a><b>Heke, Hoani</b>, was a New
Zealand chief of high rank, intelligent and turbulent. He was
married to a daughter of the famous Hongi, the devastator of the
North Island after he had procured muskets and gunpowder in England
during his visit in 1820. Alarmed by certain Government measures,
Heke listened to the tales of mischief-making foreigners, who told
him that the Pakehas would take the country by force and reduce the
Maoris to the condition of serfs. They pointed to the British flag
flying at Kororareka (Russell) as at once the symbol of English
supremacy and Maori subjection. Heke's pride was wounded, while his
apprehensions were aroused. He said he would test the matter by
cutting down the flagstaff. "It had," he said, "neither bones nor
blood, and could feel no pain." He summoned his followers, and in
broad day carried his threat into execution, on Monday, July 8th,
1844. In consequence of this daring act about two hundred troops
were sent from Sydney to the Bay of Islands, under the command of
Colonel Hulme, to punish Heke for his outrage. Several chiefs,
among whom was the ever-loyal Tamati Waka Nene, persuaded the
Governor to restrain hostilities, and promised to pay for the
flagstaff and become sureties for Heke's good behaviour for the
future. The Governor accepted Heke's apology, but the latter felled
the flagstaff a second and a third time. Again it was put up, and
not only sheathed with iron, six feet high, but a block-house
erected, and a guard of twenty soldiers placed in charge. Heke was
now joined by Kawiti, an old warrior chief. They headed a force of
eight hundred men, and encamped within a mile of the town of
Kororareka, which had a population of four hundred souls. Several
skirmishes took place between them and the "bluejackets" of H.M.S.
<i>Hazard</i>, in one of which Lieutenant Philpotts (son of the
late Bishop of Exeter) was taken prisoner. They took his pistols,
danced round him, and then, returning him one of the pistols, let
him go, bidding him to take more care of himself. Three months
later Philpotts led the forlorn hope in the fatal attack on
Ohaeawae Pa, and was killed. On March 10th a combined attack was
made on the settlement, and after a sharp conflict the Maoris
gained the day. But they showed great forbearance in the hour of
victory. They not only allowed the inhabitants to withdraw to the
<i>Hazard</i> in safety, but to carry with them all they could of
their movables, and even helped them to do so. They of course
appropriated all that was left, and sacked the town, burning all
the houses, leaving only the two churches and parsonages standing.
Thus was inaugurated a struggle between the Pakeha and Maoris,
which, after uncertain intervals of peace, broke out from time to
time, till it eventuated in the Maori war, which exceeded in
duration the ten years' Trojan war, and cost the empire many
millions sterling, besides a large expenditure of "British blood
and treasure." On the whole, however, it must be admitted that,
although war, in any shape, is a chapter of horrors, the British
forces never met a more brave or chivalrous foe than the Maori.
Hoani Heke was essentially a fighting chief. His success at the Bay
of Islands whetted his appetite for further conquest, and he
planned an expedition against the town of Auckland, which must have
proved disastrous to the colonists but for the interference of the
great Ngapuhi chief, Te Tirarau, an account of which will be found
under the latter name. In the north Tamati Waka was marshalling his
forces to keep Heke in check. In the engagements between them, the
latter was wounded in the thigh, and his colleague, Kawiti, on one
occasion, escaped only by feigning death. Hoani Heke never
altogether recovered from the effects of his wound, but long before
his death permanent peace had been established with the Ngapuhi
tribe, the fighting being after wards further south. Heke was
amongst the Maoris pardoned by proclamation, but held aloof from
the Hintes for a considerable time. In July 1849 he wrote a letter
to the Queen, dwelling on the necessity of adhering to the mutual
relations established between George III. and Hongi, and
deprecating the pouring out of innocent Maori blood by the
quarrelsome foreigners. He died of consumption on August 6th, 1850,
at the age of forty-two, a professing Christian.</p>

Stimulated by his exertions, a new church was built, which cost
£23,000, and was opened in 1868. He died on June 23rd, 1876, at

He entered at the Middle Temple on May 29th, 1852; and was called
to the bar on Jan. 26th, 1858. He was a revising barrister and
author of a "Handbook of the Constitution." In 1883 he was
appointed Attorney-General of Western Australia with a seat in the
Executive and Legislative Councils. He resigned in 1886 owing to a
dispute with the Governor, Sir F. Napier Broome, but still resided
in Western Australia, and in 1892 was appointed third judge of the
Supreme Court.</p>

<p><a name="A657" id="A657"></a><b>Henty, Edward</b>, the pioneer
settler of Victoria, was the third son of Thomas Henty, of West
Tarring, Sussex, England, banker and farmer, and Frances Elizabeth
his wife, daughter of Joseph Hopkins, and was born at West Tarring
on March 10th, 1809. His father, at the commencement of the present
century, was one of the half-dozen breeders of merino sheep in
England, having secured his blood at the sale of the flock
presented to George III. by the King of Spain. The foundation of
the Swan River settlement in Western Australia in 1829 turned the
attention of Mr. Thomas Henty to the subject of colonisation, and
he determined to send his sons James, John, and Stephen George to
explore the country, with the idea of following himself, with the
rest of his family, the Government having promised him a grant of
80,000 acres. He accordingly chartered a vessel, the
<i>Caroline</i>, and put on board labourers and their families,
twelve months' supply of provisions, and valuable stock and
appliances for establishing an agricultural and pastoral
settlement. The party sailed in May 1829, and duly arrived at
Perth, where Mr. James Henty purchased land for the purpose of
locating the families, stock, etc., in his charge, until he could
obtain suitable grants from the Government. Mr. Henty, sen., was
about to follow, with the rest of his family, when, in 1830, he
received advices from James that he and his brothers saw no
prospect of doing good in West Australia, and had determined to
proceed to Launceston, in Tasmania. This information entirely
altered the plans of the father, who accordingly, with his wife and
sons, Edward and Francis, followed them to Van Diemen's Land in the
<i>Forth of Alloway</i>, a vessel carrying emigrants, valuable
stock, etc. They arrived in April 1831, and settled down. A
twelvemonth, however, sufficed to disillusionise Mr. Edward Henty
with his prospects in the island, and he determined to cross Bass'
Straits, and seek suitable land on the southern shores of the
continent of Australia. He left Launceston in the barque
<i>Carnarron</i> in 1832, and landed at Memory Cove, in Spencer's
Gulf, and afterwards at Port Lincoln, in South Australia, places
discovered by Flinders. He remained there looking for a location,
until he was called for, as arranged, by the brigantine
<i>Thistle</i>, on her way from Swan River to Tasmania. On the
passage back he anchored in Portland Bay, in what is now Victoria,
which place so took his fancy that he returned in the
<i>Elizabeth</i> from Launceston, and a more extended examination
of the country determined him to form a settlement there. Before
doing so he and his father again visited Portland in the
<i>Thistle</i>, on their way to Swan River, to settle about the
land Mr. Thomas Henty held there, and which he agreed with James
Henty in condemning. In Oct. 1834, having completed his
arrangements, Mr. Edward Henty sailed in the <i>Thistle</i>,
Captain Liddle, and conveyed to Portland labourers, cattle, farming
implements, fruit-trees, vines, seeds, etc., landing at 8 a.m. on
Nov. 19th, 1834, after a tempestuous passage of thirty-four days.
In the first two years of the settlement the <i>Thistle</i> was
regularly employed bringing over sheep, cattle, horses, and
provisions, which clearly proves that all residents in and about
Launceston, including Batman and Fawkner, who were afterwards
asserted to be the first settlers, were perfectly aware of the
settlement being formed by the Hentys in what is now known as
Victoria. The very fruit-trees planted by Mr. Edward Henty at
Portland were purchased from Fawkner, who at that time kept a
nursery garden on Windmill Hill, Launceston. A month after the
first arrival Mr. Edward Henty landed the first pure merino sheep,
and at the same time (Dec. 14th) his brother Francis paid him a
visit and remained a month. Shortly afterwards the brothers joined
their fortunes, and achieved much success in the gradual settlement
of the beautiful Wannon country, where they grazed sheep and
cattle, and in the meantime traded with the whalers through the
business house they founded in Portland. Mr. Edward Henty was not
twenty-five years of age when he put together the first plough that
ever broke Victorian soil, and welded with his own hands the chains
by which it was drawn. His rooftree was more than five hundred
miles from the nearest house, and he was often put to straits in
dealing with the wild cannibal blacks surrounding him; but on no
occasion did he ever have need to fire upon them. Two years
afterwards Stephen Henty finally gave up Swan River and joined his
brothers at Portland Bay. On the concession of representative
institutions to Victoria, Mr. Edward Henty became the
representative of the county of Normanby in the Legislative
Assembly, and was re-elected in 1859, but being defeated in 1861,
he did not again offer himself. Mr. Henty, who subsequently
unsuccessfully contested the Western province for the Legislative
Council, gave a monster picnic to all the school children in
Portland in 1872, to celebrate the completion of his thirty-eight
years' residence there. In addressing the assemblage he said: "I
have invited you here to-day, as I wish to impress upon your minds
the fact that I was the pioneer of the colony. When you are grown
up and hear people talking about these matters you can say you knew
Mr. Henty the pioneer, and that you were brought up in the town
with him. That I am the oldest Victorian is proved by this book,
the 'Old Colonists' Address to Prince Alfred,' signed by seven
hundred old colonists, in which my name heads the list, the date of
Mr. Fawkner's landing in Victoria being given by himself as Oct.
9th, 1835. You can tell them, 'It is true Mr. Henty made a home for
himself, and it is equally true that he was instrumental in making
homes for us.'" Mr. Henty died at his residence, St. Kilda Road,
Melbourne, on August 14th, 1878. When Mr. Edward Henty landed in
Portland there were no white settlers on the coast between King
George's Sound, in West Australia, and Twofold Bay, in New South
Wales.</p>

<p><a name="A658" id="A658"></a><b>Henty, Francis</b>, brother of
the above, was the youngest son of Thomas Henty, was born at Field
Place, Worthing, Sussex, on Nov. 30th, 1815, and emigrated to
Tasmania with his father. He subsequently followed his brother
Edward to Portland, Vict., landing a month later than that
gentleman, on Dec. 14th, 1834. Having returned to Tasmania on a
visit in the following year, he called in at Port Phillip (now
Melbourne) in September, and assisted Mr. Batman, the founder of
the city, to pitch a tent on what was afterwards known as Batman's
Hill. In the last week of August 1836 Sir Thomas Mitchell, the
explorer, visited Portland on his way overland from Sydney to the
southern shore of the continent. At this time there was no one
settled nearer Portland than where Melbourne now stands, and the
appearance of a stranger was somewhat startling in those days of
escaped convicts. However, the Major was recognised by one of the
establishment. He was furnished with supplies, had the pleasure of
witnessing the excitement of a whale chase, and in return informed
the Messrs. Henty of the existence of the fine country at the back
of Portland, on the Wannon River, which he had named Australia
Felix. Hitherto the latter had not gone more than twenty miles
inland with their flocks. On August 3rd, 1837, a settlement was
commenced in this country at the spot since known as Merino Downs,
of which Mr. Francis Henty became the owner. Conflicts between the
blacks and some of the whites could scarcely be avoided, but Mr.
Henty had not much trouble, the aborigines soon becoming friendly;
but they were never allowed to bring their spears and other weapons
within a certain distance of the hut. To show how quickly the
country was taken up after the first essay had been made, it may be
mentioned that in 1839 Messrs. James and Stephen G. Henty rode
overland from Geelong to Portland, and were able to obtain shelter
each night during the whole journey. Mr. Henty, though keeping up
his establishment at Merino Downs, resided for the last few years
of his life in Melbourne. He married at Launceston, Tas., Miss Mary
Ann Lawrence, who died in Nov. 1881. Mr. Henty died at Kew, near
Melbourne, on Jan. 15th, 1889.</p>

<p><a name="A659" id="A659"></a><b>Henty, Hon. James</b>, M.L.C.,
brother of above and eldest son of Thomas Henty, was born at West
Tarring on Sept. 24th, 1800. He was engaged in farming with his
father, and then joined the family banking firm in the county of
Sussex. In June 1829 he went to West Australia with his brothers
John and Stephen George, but, being dissatisfied with the country,
proceeded to Tasmania in 1831, where his father and brothers joined
him. Mr. James Henty started business as a general merchant in
Launceston, and from 1851 was head of the firm of James Henty and
Co., of Melbourne and Geelong. Mr. Henty declined a nominee seat in
the Legislative Council of Tasmania in 1844, and settled
permanently in Victoria in 1851, being, returned to the old
Legislative Council of that colony in the following year. After
responsible government was conceded, Mr. Henty sat in the present
Legislative Council of Victoria as member for the South-western
Province. He was one of the promoters of the Melbourne and Hobson's
Bay Railway, and was one of the directors, and for some time
chairman, of the company. He married in 1830 Miss Carter, of
Worthing, Sussex, who died in 1868. Mr. Henty died in 1882.</p>

<p><a name="A660" id="A660"></a><b>Henty, Hon. William</b>,
formerly a Minister of the Crown in Tasmania, and brother of above,
was the fifth son of Thomas Henty. He went to Tasmania with his
father in 1831, and was admitted to the Bar of that colony in 1837,
practising at Launceston. Having been elected to the Legislative
Assembly for the Tamar district in 1856, he was Colonial Secretary
in the Weston, Smith, and second Weston Ministries from April 1857
to August 1861. He filled the same office in the Chapman Ministry
from the latter date till Nov. 1862, when he retired from public
life, and returned to England. Mr. Henty married Miss Campfield,
sister of the Government resident at Albany, W.A. He died at West
Brighton, England, on July 11th, 1881.</p>

Algernon Herbert, fifth son of Henry, 1st Earl of Carnarvon, by
Marianne, daughter of Thomas Lempriere, of Jersey. He was born on
June 12th, 1831, and educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford,
where he was scholar in 1849; Hertford scholar in 1851; Ireland
scholar and Latin verse prizeman in 1852, and Eldon scholar in
1854. He graduated B.A. with high honours in 1854, and in that year
became Fellow of All Souls' College in the same university. He
entered at the Inner Temple in July 1854, and was called to the bar
in April 1858. Having been Secretary to Mr. Gladstone when
Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1855, he emigrated to Australia, and
going to Queensland, became in March 1859 Colonial Secretary of
that colony after its separation from New South Wales, sitting in
the first Legislative Assembly for Leichardt, and becoming the
first Premier of that colony. His administration lasted till. Feb.
1866, Mr. Herbert holding the additional post of Acting Colonial
Treasurer from Oct. 1864. He was again Premier without portfolio
for a few days in July and August of the year 1866. Returning to
England, he was one of the Assistant Secretaries to the Board of
Trade from 1868 to Feb. 1870, when he was appointed Assistant
Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies and Under-Secretary in
succession to Sir Frederick Rogers (afterwards Lord Blackford) on
May 21st, 1871. In Feb. 1892, after over twenty years' service as
Under-Secretary, Sir Robert Herbert resigned this important post,
which gives its occupant a highly potential voice in all the
details of administration which the progress of self-governing
institutions still leaves to the central authority in Downing
Street. At the same time Sir Robert resigned the secretaryship of
the Order of St Michael and St. George, which he had held since May
1877.</p>

married, in 1873, Henry Heron, a solicitor in Sydney. Having
visited England, where she remained for two years and a half, she
adopted literary pursuits, and contributed tales and essays to the

sometime Commissioner of Public Works, Victoria, was a native of
Scotland, and was born at Glasgow in 1820. When eighteen years of
age Mr. Hervey emigrated to Sydney, N.S.W., and ultimately was
largely engaged in pastoral pursuits in the Port Phillip district,
which in 1851 was constituted the separate colony of Victoria. He
sat in the mixed Legislative Council of that colony, and when
responsible government was achieved he was returned to the first
wholly elective Legislative Council for the Eastern Province in
1856. From March 1861 to Nov. 1862 he was acting president of the
latter body during the absence in England of Sir&nbsp;J. F. Palmer.
When the&nbsp;M?Culloch&nbsp;Ministry was formed in June 1863 Mr.
Hervey accepted a portfolio as Vice-President of the Board of Land
and Works and Commissioner of Public Works. He resigned both his
office and his seat in Parliament in July 1865, owing to having met
with pecuniary reverses. Misfortune still continued to pursue him,
and he died under very sudden and distressing circumstances on Nov.
1st, 1874, when a coroner's jury returned a verdict that death had
resulted from insufficient nourishment. [This biography appeared in

<p><a name="A668" id="A668"></a><b>Higinbotham, His Honour the Hon.
George</b>, M.A., Chief Justice of Victoria, is the sixth son of
the late Henry T. Higinbotham, of Dublin, Ireland, where he was
born in 1827. He was educated at the Royal School, Dungannon, and
at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated B.A. in 1849, and
M.A. in 1853. When just of age he went to London, and entered
himself for the Bar at Lincoln's Inn on April 20th, 1848. He also
connected himself with journalism, becoming in 1849 a reporter on
the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, on which paper Mr. B. C. Aspinall,
afterwards a political contemporary in Melbourne, was one of his
colleagues. Having been called to the Bar on June 6th, 1853, Mr.
Higinbotham left the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, and emigrated to
Melbourne, where he arrived early in 1854. Here he practised his
profession, contributing meanwhile to the Melbourne <i>Herald</i>.
In 1856 he accepted the editorship of the <i>Argus</i>, in
succession to Mr. Edward Wilson, who was also the principal
proprietor. This post he held till 1859, when he resigned and
resumed his practice at the Bar. He now began to take a part in
politics, and was returned to the Legislative Assembly for Brighton
in 1861 as an independent Liberal. His independence was too decided
to prove palatable to the majority of his constituents, and he was
rejected at the general election in the same year, but was again
elected nine months later, when the sitting member, Mr. Brodribb,
resigned. Mr. Higinbotham opposed what is known as the Duffy Land
Act of 1862, and when, in June 1863, the O'Shanassy Government was
defeated, he accepted office in the ablest of all Victorian
Cabinets, which was then formed under Mr. (now Sir James)
M?Culloch. He took the post of Attorney-General, and held it for
five stormy years, during which the question of the financial
predominance of the two Houses was raised and contested with a
stubbornness which brought the colony to the verge of revolution.
As the legal adviser of the Government, which by "tacks" and still
more drastic devices vindicated the financial supremacy of the
Lower Chamber, Mr. Higinbotham became the central figure of the
long struggle waged in reference to the tariff and the Darling
grant; and gained a hold on the popular sympathies of Victoria
which he has never since forfeited. The full details of this
notable constitutional struggle will be found in the notice of Sir
James M?Culloch, and need not be recapitulated. It has always been
Mr. Higinbotham's contention that the Governor of an autonomous
colony like Victoria should act absolutely on the advice of his
local Ministers in all purely local concerns, just as would be the
case with the Queen herself in England. He thus found it
impossible, when the M?Culloch Government was reconstituted after
the short Sladen interlude, to return to his old post of
Attorney-General, under a Governor (Lord Canterbury) who had given
such palpable proof of his determination to be ruled, not by his
Ministers or the majority in the Assembly, but by instructions from
Downing Street. Not wishing, however, to desert his party, be in
July 1868, when Mr. M?Culloch returned to power, accepted the post
of Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works and a seat in the
Cabinet without salary. He was thus able to give his countenance
and support to the administration without being brought into
personal contact or collision with an authority which he
disapproved. In Feb. 1869, however, he retired from even this
modified position. In 1871, to the astonishment of the whole
colony, Mr. Higinbotham was rejected at Brighton in favour of Mr.
Bent, whose view of his position as a "local member" was more in
accord with the purely material aspirations of the constituency
than Mr. Higinbotham's high-minded estimate of his functions as a
representative of the people. Thus dismissed, the latter devoted
himself to his large and onerous practice at the Bar until 1874,
when he was returned to the Assembly for Brunswick. He, however,
shortly resigned, finding it impossible to approve of all the
methods employed by the Berry party in the somewhat similar
constitutional battle which they were now waging against his old
chief, Sir James M?Culloch, who by one of the strange mutations of
politics now marshalled the Conservative phalanx. He could not
oppose Mr. Berry on the score of principle, and he would not
support him in practices which he thought subversive of
parliamentary government. Retirement was therefore his only
alternative, and he remained out of Parliament, seldom interfering
with politics, till 1880, when he was appointed to a seat on the
Puisne Bench of the Supreme Court of Victoria. In 1886, on the
retirement of Sir William Stawell, he accepted the position of
Chief Justice of the colony, which he still holds. Mr. Higinbotham
has on several occasions refused knighthood on the ground that all
rewards for local services should emanate from local sources. In
his capacity as Chief Justice he would, as a matter of custom, have
been appointed acting Governor of Victoria during the absence on
leave of Sir Henry Loch in 1888. He had, however, intimated plainly
that he should carry into practical effect the views as to the
relations of the administrator of the Government to Downing Street
and to the local Ministry respectively which he had consistently
advocated during his whole political career. As this would have
meant a cessation of all references to Downing Street in matters of
local concern, the Colonial Office, jealous of its privileges,
appointed Sir William Robinson to specially replace Sir Henry Loch
during the latter's absence in England. Mr. Higinbotham, who is one
of the best speakers and the most personally respected man in
Australia, takes a broad-minded and unconventional view of
religious and social questions. During the "great strike" he
incurred a large amount of class opprobrium through his outspoken
adherence to the cause of the strikers, to whose funds he
contributed and promised to continue to contribute till the masters
conceded a conference.</p>

<p><a name="A670" id="A670"></a><b>Hindmarsh, Rear-Admiral Sir
John</b>, K.H., first Governor of South Australia, was born in
1786, and entered the navy when only seven years old, as a
first-class volunteer on board the <i>Bellerophon</i>, in which
ship, at the battle of the Nile, when but a midshipman, and
happening to be the only officer on the quarter-deck at the time,
he greatly distinguished himself by the presence of mind with
which, by cutting her cable and ordering her sails to be set, he
saved the <i>Bellerophon</i> from being blown up with the French
ship <i>L'Orient</i>. In recognition of his services on that
occasion the ship's officers presented him with a sword, and he was
publicly thanked by Lord Nelson, who, in 1803, on assuming the
command of the <i>Victory</i>, wrote to Hindmarsh to join him on
that world-famous ship. Having become lieutenant, the latter served
on the <i>Phoebe</i> at Trafalgar, at Aix Roads, and at the capture
of the Ile de France and of Java, being made commander in 1814,
post captain in 1830, and rear-admiral in 1856. He was placed in
command of H.M.S. <i>Buffalo</i>, and made K.H. in 1836, in which
year he was appointed first Governor of South Australia. Landing
from the Buffalo at Glenelg on Dec. 28th in that year, he read the
proclamation creating South Australia a British colony under an old
gum-tree, which is still shown to visitors as the cradle of the
province. The success which had attended Captain Hindmarsh (as he
then was) in the naval service failed him in his new capacity in
South Australia, where the differences which arose between himself
and the resident Commissioner, the late Sir James Hurtle Fisher,
had the effect of dividing the colonists into two factions, and
rendering the pacific administration of the province impossible. In
order to end the deadlock, the Home Government dismissed Sir James
Fisher and recalled Captain Hindmarsh, who left the colony in July
1838. It is but just to him to state that one of the causes of his
unpopularity was his far-seeing desire to open up the navigation of
the Murray, a work which has since been accomplished with entire
success and universal applause. Captain Hindmarsh, who was knighted
in 1851, and received a good service pension, and a war medal with
seven clasps for the seven great actions in which he had been
engaged, was Governor of Heligoland from 1840 to 1857, and married
Susannah Wilson, daughter of H. D. Edmeades. His only son, John
Hindmarsh, was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1846, and
subsequently practised in South Australia, where he resided. Sir
John Hindmarsh died in 1859.</p>

<p><a name="A683" id="A683"></a><b>Hodgson, Sir Arthur</b>,
K.C.M.G., son of the late Rev. Edward Hodgson, of Rickmansworth,
Herts, was born in 1818, and educated at Eton and Cambridge
University. He served for three years as a midshipman on board
H.M.S. <i>Canopus</i>, and emigrated to New South Wales in 1840,
becoming one of the pioneer settlers in the Moreton Bay district
(now Queensland), where his station at Etonville is well known.
Before the separation of Moreton Bay from New South Wales he
represented the Darling Downs in the Legislative Assembly of the
latter colony, and in 1856 he was appointed general superintendent
of the Australian Agricultural Company. He favoured the
introduction of convict labour and the establishment of a colonial
peerage, and opposed all the popular movements which eventuated in
the formation of Queensland into a separate colony, under
democratic institutions. He represented Queensland at the
International Exhibition in London in 1862, and was for some time
member for the Warrego in the Queensland Legislative Assembly,
being Secretary for Public Works in the Mackenzie Ministry from
Sept. to Nov. 1868, and Colonial Secretary in the Lilley Government
from Jan. to Nov. 1869, when he left the colony on a visit to
England, where he finally settled in 1874. He represented
Queensland at the Paris Exhibition, was created C.M.G. in 1878, and
was a Royal Commissioner for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in
1886, and General Secretary to the Reception Committee in
connection therewith, being created K.C.M.G. in that year in
recognition of his services. He is a J. P. and D.L. for the county
of Warwick, and was High Sheriff in 1881. Sir Arthur married in
1841 Eliza, daughter of the late Sir James Dowling, formerly Chief
Justice of New South Wales.</p>

<p><a name="A684" id="A684"></a><b>Hogan, James Francis</b>, author
and journalist, is a native of the south of Ireland, and was born
in 1855. His parents emigrated to Victoria during his infancy. He
entered the service of the Victorian Education Department at an
early age; but an article on "The Coming Australian," which he
contributed to the <i>Victorian Review</i>, attracted so much
attention that it led to his engagement on the regular staff of
that periodical, and he thus embarked on a literary career. Several
articles of his also appeared in the <i>Melbourne Review</i>. In
1881 Mr. Hogan joined the staff of the <i>Melbourne Argus</i>, and
most of his journalistic work is to be found in the columns of that
paper. But he also found time to contribute a good deal of humorous
pabulum to <i>Melbourne Punch</i>, to act as Melbourne literary
correspondent of the <i>Sydney Daily Telegraph</i>, and to write on
Roman Catholic subjects in the <i>Melbourne Advocate</i>. Mr. Hogan
took an active part in all Irish and Catholic movements in
Melbourne. He was the founder and the first president of the
Victorian Catholic Young Men's Society, and the secretary of the
Melbourne Daniel O'Connell Statue Fund. In 1886 he published a
volume of colonial stories and sketches under the title of "An
Australian Christmas Collection," consisting of a selection from
his contributions to colonial periodicals. In 1887 Mr. Hogan came
to London <i>viâ</i> America to publish a work to which he had
devoted a large amount of time and research in the colonies&mdash;a
history of "The Irish in Australia." It was issued towards the
close of 1887, and went through three editions with remarkable
rapidity. Sir Charles Gavan Duffy made it the text of a brilliant
article in the <i>Contemporary Review</i> for Jan. 1888. Mr.
Hogan's next book was "The Australian in London." This was followed
by a romantic story of Australian adventure entitled "The Lost
Explorer," published in 1890. Next year he published "The Convict
King," a vivacious narrative of the extraordinary career of Jorgen
Jorgenson, one of the most remarkable adventurers of the century.
Of it the London <i>Daily Telegraph</i> wrote, "Not for many a long
day has there been published so interesting a romance of real life.
Mr. Hogan's book positively whets the reader's appetite. Like
Oliver Twist, we ask for more about this marvellous man." He is a
well-known industrious writer on colonial subjects in the <i>Pall
Mall Gazette</i>, the <i>Star</i>, and the <i>Dublin Freeman's
Journal</i>, and also contributes to <i>Chambers' Journal</i>.</p>

at the Ripon Grammar School. In 1827 he entered at Christ College,
Cambridge, as a medical student, and also at the University of
Edinburgh, becoming M.D. of the latter in 1830, and M.B. of
Cambridge and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in
London in 1832. Having decided to relinquish the medical
profession, he entered himself as a law-student at Lincoln's Inn,
but almost immediately afterwards (June 1835) started on his
travels. After visiting Italy, he reached Alexandria in Sept. 1836,
and made a most exhaustive tour of Egypt and the Soudan,
penetrating to Khartoum. On his return he remonstrated with the
Egyptian Government on the subject of the slave trade, and with
some success. Nov. 1838 found him again in London, after a visit to
Palestine and Syria. In 1841 he was called to the bar, and
emigrated in 1843 to New Zealand, where he remained for two years.
In 1845 he settled in Sydney, N.S.W., and was admitted to the bar
of that colony in Oct 1845. From 1851 to 1856 he represented the
western boroughs (Bathurst and Carcoar) in the old Legislative
Council of New South Wales; and on the concession of responsible
Government in the latter year was elected to the Legislative
Assembly for the same constituency, for which he sat till 1858,
when he was defeated, but two years later was elected for
Parramatta, and was for some time Chairman of Committees. He was
Minister for Public Works in Mr. (afterwards Sir) James Martin's
first Administration from Oct. 1863 to Feb. 1865. In 1866 he was
appointed Master in Equity of the Supreme Court of New South Wales,

Jan. 25th, 1828, and educated at Winchester School, where he
entered as a commoner in 1841, and carried off in two consecutive
years the Queen's gold medal for the best Latin-English prose
essays. In 1846 he left Winchester and proceeded to Trinity
College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. as first class in
classics in 1851, and took his M.A. degree in 1854. Having
determined to embrace the legal profession, Mr. Justice Holroyd
entered as a student at Gray's Inn in Nov. 1851, and was called to
the bar in June 1855. For the next three years he practised with
success, and also contributed to the press. But, having a fancy for
colonial life, he decided to emigrate to Australia, arriving in
Melbourne in 1859, in July of which year he was admitted to the
Victorian bar, and to that of Tasmania in 1867. Judge Holroyd soon
took a leading position at the Victorian bar in equity and mining
cases, and in 1872 was offered the seat upon the bench rendered
vacant by the retirement of the late Mr. Justice Williams. This,
however, he declined, and continued to practise at the Equity Bar
with constantly increasing success, being made Q.C. in 1879. In
August 1881 he decided to accept the judgeship rendered vacant by
the death of Mr. Wilberforce Stephen, and still retains his seat
upon the Supreme Court bench of Victoria. Mr. Justice Holroyd
married at Melbourne, in 1862, Anna Maria Hoyles, daughter of the
late Henry Compton, of Totnes, Devon, and granddaughter of the Rev.
T. Compton, sometime vicar of Paignton in that county.</p>

capture of the fortress of San Juan, Ullva, and followed the
fortunes of the Mexican-Spanish war to its close. He next went to
the United States, visiting several Indian encampments, and
experiencing many adventures. Returning to England, he devoted
himself to literature. Among his published works are "The Spirit of
Peers and People," "The Death of Marlowe," "Cosmo de Medici,"
"Gregory VII.," dramas on the Elizabethan model, and "Orion," the
poem by which he is mainly known. This latter work, an epic poem,
was originally published at a farthing, partly with the view of
obtaining a wide circulation for the first three editions of the
work, of which no one was allowed to buy more than one copy. In
1846 Mr. Horne published "Ballads and Romances." He was also a
prolific prose-writer, and edited and partly wrote "Spirits of the
Age," which comprises accounts of some of the leading characters of
the day. To this work Mrs. Barrett Browning was a contributor. Mr.
Horne left England in 1852 for Victoria with William Howitt, and
for some time commanded the gold escort between Ballarat and
Melbourne. He also became one of the champion swimmers of
Australia, and it is stated that he once swam bound hand and foot.
He held various positions in the Victorian Civil Service. He was a
member of the Board of Commissioners of Sewers and Water Supply,
which planned and constructed the reservoir at Yan Yean, nineteen
miles from Melbourne, whence the city still draws its water supply.
At a <i>déjeuner</i> given when the Yan Yean works were in a
forward state, he made an elaborate speech, and subsequently
recorded these and other of his colonial experiences in a work
entitled "Australian Facts and Prospects," published by Smith,
Elder &amp; Co. in 1859. Mr. Horne returned to England in 1869, and
was awarded a civil list pension of £100 per annum in 1874. In 1877
he collected and published the letters addressed to him by Mrs.
Barrett Browning, and this is the only correspondence of Mrs.
Browning's that has been given to the public. Mr. Horne died at

the political association formed in 1835 at Hobart Town, to obtain
a redress of the grievances under which the colonists laboured,
especially in regard to the employment of convicts as constables,
and the substitution of military for common juries. Having been for
some time previously Attorney-General, he was appointed a Puisne
Judge in 1848, on the removal of Judge Montagu for misbehaviour in
office. Whilst still on the bench, he was elected to the
Legislative Council, on the concession of responsible government in
1856, for the district of Hobart, and was chosen president of that
body, a position which he held from Dec. 1856 to Sept. 1859. In the
following year he resigned the judgeship, retiring on a pension,

at the Olympic, and went to Australia in 1856, where he was engaged
at the Queen's Theatre, Melbourne. He became manager of the
Ballarat Theatre in 1858, and of the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, in
1863. He subsequently managed the Haymarket Theatre, Melbourne, and
rebuilt the Theatre Royal at Christchurch, N.Z. From 1884 till his

Prebendary of Rochester, and grandson of Lord Hotham, a Baron of
the Court of Exchequer. His mother was Anne Elizabeth, eldest
daughter of Thomas Hallett Hodges, of Hemsted Place, Kent. He was
born at Dennington, Suffolk, of which his father was then rector,
in 1806, and entered the navy in Nov. 1818, and saw a great deal of
active service, becoming lieutenant in 1825, commander in 1828,
post-captain in 1833, and K.C.B. in March 1846, in recognition of
his gallant action off the coast of South America in the previous
November, when he ascended the Parma River, and, with a very
insufficient contingent, defeated the vastly superior forces of
General Rosas at Punta Obligado, destroying four batteries and
twenty-five ships which barred his passage. In Dec. 1853 Sir
Charles married Jane Sarah, daughter of Lord Bridport and widow of
Hugh Holbech, of Farnborough, Warwick, who survived him, and
married, thirdly, in 1860, Captain Armytage, R.N. He was employed
on various diplomatic missions, and ultimately appointed to succeed
Mr. Latrobe as Governor of Victoria, arriving in Hobson's Bay on
June 21st, 1854. Though well intentioned, Sir Charles Hotham was
somewhat imprudent, and thus increased the difficulties of a
difficult situation. It is to his credit that he at once recognised
the growing force of the popular movement, which just before his
death resulted in the concession of full autonomous institutions to
the Victorian colonists. His strength was overtaxed in grappling
with the enormous difficulties of the financial situation, the
opposition to the policy of the Home Government in regard to the
influx of convicts, and the troubles over the diggers' licences,
culminating in the regrettable bloodshed at Ballarat. Whatever his
failings as a proconsul, it must not be forgotten that under his
<i>régime</i> responsible government was conceded to Victoria, the
extravagance of the finances redressed, and the exclusion of
convicts finally accepted as an unalterable principle both by the
local and the imperial administrations. During his governorship,
too, a great advance was made in material progress, the Hobson's
Bay Railway and the Melbourne Gas Works being inaugurated during
his tenure of office. Sir Charles died in Melbourne on the last day
of the year 1855, from a choleraic affection resulting in epilepsy.
The Legislative Council voted £1500 to defray the expenses of his
funeral, and for the erection of a monument to his memory.</p>

occasional trips to New Zealand, he gave up the sea, to which he
had been brought up, and settled at Narellan, N.S.W., in 1819,
where he commenced his career as an explorer, and travelled from
Ulladulla to Shoalhaven. Widening the scope of his explorations, he
accompanied Mr. Hamilton Hume overland to Port Phillip in 1824,

energetic bushman; and when the relief party which was sent in
quest of the Burke and Wills expedition was projected in 1861, Mr.
Howitt was chosen leader. Near Swan Hill he met Brahe returning
with the intelligence that Burke had not returned to the depôt. Mr.
Howitt was reinforced and sent forward. He crossed the Darling near
Wilcannia, and directing his course towards the Stokes ranges
(reached and named by Sturt in 1845), passed McAdam Range, Wilkie's
Creek, Mount Shillinglaw, McLeays Plains, and finally the depôt at
Fort Wills, on Cooper's Creek, on September 8th. On the 16th the
party found King, the survivor; two days after they buried the
remains of Wills, and on the 21st those of Burke. The relief party,
with King, returned to Melbourne on Nov. 28th, 1861. It having been
determined that the remains of Burke and Wills should be brought to
Melbourne, Mr. Howitt was again sent to Cooper's Creek with a
stronger party. They left Melbourne on Dec. 1st, 1861; reached Fort
Wills on Feb. 18th, 1862, after making several excursions in
various directions and discovering Baleman's, Burrell's, Phillip's,
O'Donneld's, and Williams' creeks, and Lake Short. Mr, Howitt
finally left Cooper's Creek in Oct. 1862, arriving, with the
remains of Burke and Wills, in Adelaide on Dec. 11th, and in
Melbourne on Dec 28th, 1862. Mr. Howitt, for these and other
services, was appointed police magistrate of Victoria and stationed
in Gippsland, where he resided first at Bairnsdale and latterly at
Sale. He has made a profound study of the ethnology and
characteristics of the natives of Australia; and in 1880 published
a work, in conjunction with the Rev. L. Fison, on the marriage
customs of two noted tribes. Mr. Howitt has also made a scientific
and practical study of gold mining, and was the leader of more than
one Government prospecting party. His exceptional capabilities in
this direction were recognised by his appointment in 18&mdash; as

Pittenweem, where he served his apprenticeship to a cooper. He then
went into the merchant service, and purchased a vessel, in which he
traded between Calcutta and China, and in which he came to Adelaide
in 1842. Settling in South Australia, he suffered severe reverses,
but ultimately acquired great wealth through his connection with
the Moonta, Wallaroo and Yorke's Peninsula Copper Mines, which he
discovered and developed. In 1872 he was desirous of making a
donation of £20,000 to Union College, Adelaide, which had been
established for the training of candidates for the Nonconformist
ministry; but was induced, mainly by Mr. Jefferis, to apply the sum
to the endowment of a university on a broader basis. From this act
of munificence sprang the now flourishing university of Adelaide,
of which Sir Walter, who stipulated that the money should be
applied to the endowment of a classical and an English
professorship, is commonly styled "the Father." He was knighted in
1880, and resided in England for many years prior to his death,
which took place at Fancourt, Chertsey, on New Year's Day 1887. Sir
Walter married, in 1841, Sophia, eldest daughter of John Henry
Hickman, of Warnbunga, S.A., who died in 1885.</p>

proprietor of a private lunatic asylum near Dunedin. He was bred up
to the law, and was articled in the office of Sir Robert Stout, the
well-known New Zealand statesman. His first story of any length,
and that by which his name is best known, was "The Mysteries of a
Hansom Cab," which was first published in Melbourne, where it
created a sensation. Mr. Trischler, who had been connected with the

in London, and bought the rights from the author, bringing the book
out in England in 1888, where its circulation was something
phenomenal. Subsequently the work was dramatised. Mr. Hume came to
reside in London soon after the reissue there of "The Mysteries of
a Hansom Cab." In 1889 he produced "Madame Midas," and has written
three books each year since. In 1889 he also published "The

intention of the imperial authorities to despatch a batch of
convicts to their settlement. They were thus enabled to initiate
the opposition which was successful in preventing Victoria becoming

Congregational church at Saltaire, near Bradford. He left for
Australia in broken health, in 1859, and settled at Adelaide,
where, during his eighteen years' residence, he gained a high

came of a yeoman family, and was born Dec. 9th, 1830, at Alfreston,
Sussex. He came to Victoria in 1850, and engaged in commercial
pursuits at Geelong. Mr. Jenner held the office of president of the
first reform league, established for the purpose of protecting
native Industries. He represented the south-western province in the
Legislative Council for more than twenty years, being returned in
1863 in opposition to the late Mr. C. J. Griffith, and for a number
of years was Chairman of Committees. From Sept. 1869 to April 1870
he acted as the representative of the Macpherson Government in the
Legislative Council, and subsequently discharged the same functions
for the Duffy Government. Mr. Jenner, who retired from public life
in 1884, was a director of numerous local companies, and died on

<p><a name="A735" id="A735"></a><b>Jennings, Hon. Sir Patrick
Alfred</b>, K.C.M.G., M.L.C., LL.D., is the son of the late Francis
Jennings, of Newry, Ireland, where he was born in 1831, and
subsequently educated. After some mercantile experience in Exeter,
England he arrived in Victoria in 1852, and was fairly successful
on the goldfields. 1855 he settled at St. Arnaud, in the same
colony, where he introduced elaborate quartz crushing machinery. He
was asked to stand for the Wimmera, but declined to enter the
Victorian Legislature. In 1857 he was made a magistrate, and became
Chairman of the first Road Board, and of the first Municipal
Council of the borough of St. Arnaud. Until the year 1863 the
future Prime Minister of New South Wales remained in Victoria; but
in that year he changed both his colony and his course of life, and
having secured a pastoral station at Warbreccan he henceforth
followed the life of a "squatter" in the Riverina district of the
mother colony, taking a leading part in the agitation which then
sprang up for the separation of Riverina from New South Wales, and
its constitution into a distinct colony. The distance from the
centre of administration at Sydney was the principal plea, urged on
behalf of Riverine autonomy; and in order to baulk the agitation
the Central Government decided to establish local courts of
justice, and to facilitate railway communication with the
disaffected province. The then Premier, Mr. (afterwards Sir) James
Martin, personally visited the district, frankly admitted its
meagre parliamentary representation, and, as a compensation,
offered to nominate several leading local gentlemen to the
Legislative Council of New South Wales. Mr. Jennings was the only
member of the Riverina Association who accepted this diplomatic
invitation in 1867. In 1869 he resigned his seat in the Legislative
Council, and stood for the popular chamber. He was elected, and
remained as the representative of the Murray district in the
Assembly until 1873. Subsequently he was offered a Cabinet
portfolio, but in 1874 he was unsuccessful in his contest for
Mudgee, and remained out of Parliament for some years, being
returned for the Bogan in 1880. In 1874 Mr. Jennings received the
Order of St. Gregory the Great from Pius IX., and in 1875 acted as
Special Commissioner for New South Wales at the Victorian
Exhibition. In 1876 he represented New South Wales, Queensland, and
Tasmania at the Philadelphia Exhibition; and subsequently visiting
Europe, he was presented to the late Pope, and received the
distinction of Knight-Commander of Pius IX. and of St. Gregory the
Great. In Dec. 1878 Mr. Jennings agreed to accept office under Sir
John Robertson as Vice-President of the Executive Council, and
Leader of the Upper House; but the Ministry not being installed,
the appointment lapsed. In 1879, in which year he was created
C.M.G., he was appointed Executive Commissioner for the first
International Exhibition of Australia, held in Sydney in September.
The enterprise proved a great success, and Mr. Jennings was created
K.C.M.G. in 1880. From Jan. to July 1883 he was Vice-President of
the Executive Council in the Stuart Ministry, and was Colonial
Treasurer in that of Mr. Dibbs from Oct. to Dec 1885. In Feb. 1886
he became Premier of New South Wales, with the office of Colonial
Treasurer, but resigned in January of the next year, and was one of
the representatives of his colony at the Colonial Conference held
in London 1887. Subsequently he revisited Rome, and was created
Grand Cross of Pius IX. by Pope Leo XIII. He was called to the
Legislative Council in 1890, and was one of the New South Wales
delegates at the Federation Convention held in Sydney in March
1891. Sir Patrick, who was made an honorary LL.D. of Dublin
University during his stay in England, married in 1864 Mary Anne,
daughter of M. Shanahan, of Marnoo, Victoria. He is a member of the
Senate of Sydney University, a Fellow of St. John's (Roman
Catholic) College, affiliated to the university, and a trustee of
the Sydney National Art Gallery.</p>

She played a small engagement with Mr. George Rignold, in
Melbourne, about eight years ago. It was not till 1886 that Miss
Jenyns drew to herself the distinct attention of the public. With
Mr. Holloway's company she played a Shakesperian season at the New

1845; was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford; succeeded
his father in Oct. 1859; and married, in 1872, the Hon. Margaret
Elizabeth, eldest daughter of the 2nd Lord Leigh. He was a
lord-in-waiting to the Queen from June 1875 to June 1877; and was
Paymaster-General and made a Privy Councillor in 1890; in July of
which year he was appointed to succeed Lord Carrington as Governor
of New South Wales. He was also created G.C.M.G.; but his departure
was postponed, owing to the illness of Lady Jersey, who contracted
typhoid fever. He left for Sydney in Nov. 1890, and was followed by
Lady Jersey in Jan. 1891. The early period of their <i>régime</i>
was made memorable by the assembling of the Federal Convention in
Sydney in March 1891; and by a terrible calamity in Sydney Harbour
in connection with the Easter Manoeuvres. Lady Jersey wrote a poem
"One People One Destiny," Sir Henry Parkes' great toast at the

<p><a name="A738" id="A738"></a><b>Jervois, Lieut.-General Sir
William Francis Drummond</b>, G.C.M.G., C.B., R.E., F.R.S., late
Governor of New Zealand, son of the late General William Jervois,
K.H., colonel 70th Foot, and Elizabeth Maitland his wife, was born
at Cowes, I.W., on Sept. 10th, 1821, and entered the Royal
Engineers from Woolwich in 1839. In 1841 he went out to the Cape,
and served there for seven years, making surveys and roads, and
building bridges, etc. He acted in 1842 as brigade-major in an
expedition against the Boers; in 1845 he was appointed
acting-adjutant to the Royal Engineers; and in 1846 was
brigade-major at Cape Town until the arrival of Sir G. Berkeley as
commander-in-chief. He subsequently served against the Kaffirs. In
1847 he became captain, and in the following year he was appointed
to the command of a company of sappers at Woolwich and Chatham.
From 1852 to 1855 he was specially employed at Alderney in
designing and executing fortifications. In 1854 he became major,
and in 1856 was appointed assistant Inspector-General of
Fortifications on the staff of the War Office. This office he held
till 1875. From 1857 to 1875 he was secretary of the Committee on
the Defence of the Empire, and in 1859 was appointed secretary to
the Royal Commission on National Defences. In 1861 he became
lieut.-colonel, and in 1862 he was Deputy Director of
Fortifications; and he was also at various times a member of the
Commission on the application of Iron to Ships and Forts, and on
other Government commissions and committees relating to Imperial
defence. He was engaged in fortification work in England, Malta,
Gibraltar, Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Bermuda, India, and
Burmah; and having become colonel in 1867, was in 1875 made
Governor of the Straits Settlements, and during his term of office,
which lasted for two years, successfully quelled an insurrection of
Malays in the states of Perak and Sungei Ujong, besides preparing a
plan for the government of the protected Malay States. In 1877 he
became major-general, and was selected by the Government to proceed
to the Australian colonies to advise upon a scheme of defence for
the Australian ports. In October of the same year he was appointed
Governor of South Australia in succession to Sir William Cairns.
This office he held till Feb. 6th, 1883, when he was transferred to
New Zealand as Governor and Commander-in-Chief, replacing Sir
Arthur Gordon. Sir William's recommendations on Australasian
defence were of great importance, and have in the main been carried
into effect. At Port Phillip he was the first person who proposed
that, in addition to artillery, at the Heads of Queenscliff and
Point Nepean, the forts, batteries, and submarine mines for the
defence of the estuary and of the City of Melbourne should be
concentrated at the Shoals near the entrance. He pointed out that
Port Phillip thus defended and the shores of the estuary thus
secured, defensive forces might act on the left flank of a hostile
body, if attempting to advance upon Melbourne from the harbour of
Westport. At Sydney he suggested that the forts, batteries, and
submarine mines for the defence of Port Jackson should be arranged
so as to keep an enemy out of the harbour, instead of fighting
him&mdash;on the principle previously designed&mdash;after he had
effected an entrance. He further planned a work and other means for
the defence of Botany Bay, by which Sydney might otherwise be
attacked from the southward. At Newcastle he proposed a fort for
the defence of that important coaling station. At Brisbane he
recommended that the approach to the town by the river should be
barred by a battery bearing on submarine mines to be placed across
the channel, and that the waters of Moreton Bay should be defended
by gun-vessels. At Adelaide he suggested the establishment of
batteries on the coast near the port, and the purchase of
gun-vessels to defend the gulf up which a hostile ship must advance
to the attack of the place. In Tasmania he proposed batteries and
other means for the defence of Hobart and the Derwent. At Auckland,
Wellington, Lyttelton, and Dunedin in New Zealand, he planned
forts, batteries and submarine mines for the defence of the
harbours at those places. He further suggested many improvements in
the organisation of the forces in the Australasian colonies. These
outlines may be gathered from the reports of Sir William Jervois,
which were, from time to time, presented to the several local
Legislatures, and the recommendations made by him for the defence
of the chief ports in Australasia, in the year 1877 and
subsequently, have mainly been carried out. Sir William Jervois
also suggested&mdash;so early as the year 1881&mdash;that the
Imperial Naval Squadron in Australasian waters should be doubled,
and that the colonies should bear half the cost of maintaining the
entire naval force there. Subsequently, during the period when Sir
George Tryon was Admiral on the station, this proposal was, at the
investigation of the Admiral, carried into effect. It should never
be forgotten that the defence of Australasia and of Australasian
commerce is really a naval question, and the protection of the
ports, which are now defended according to Sir William Jervois'
recommendations, are indeed part of the naval defence. In 1889 Sir
William Jervois retired, and was succeeded by Lord Onslow. He has
since lived in London. In 1882 he was placed upon the retired list
as lieut.-general. In Nov. 1863 he was created C.B., in May 1874
K.C.M.G., and in May 1878 G.C.M.G. Sir William Jervois married in
1850 Lucy, daughter of the late William Norsworthy. It is
understood that Sir William Jervois would not have been unwilling
to accept the agent-generalship of New Zealand in 1891 on Sir F. D.
Bell's retirement, and his name was mentioned for reappointment for
a second term as Governor of New Zealand on the resignation of Lord
Onslow in 1892, later in which year he revisited New Zealand on a
pleasure trip.</p>

ultimately abandoned it, and went to the West Indies, where, after
two years, his health broke down, and he returned to Scotland. In
1838 he went to Tasmania, where he received a Government
appointment in the office of the Superintendent of Convicts. In
1840 Mr. Johnston left for Port Phillip (Victoria), and acting in a
mercantile capacity, started an hotel in Melbourne, where he became
a member of the City Council, and ultimately an alderman. He gave
up hotel-keeping about 1846, and was elected one of the first
representatives of the city of Melbourne in the Legislative
Council, then the only chamber, Mr. (afterwards Sir John)
O'Shanassy and the late Mr. Westgarth being his colleagues. About
this time he went into partnership with the late Mr. Edward Wilson
(<i>q.v.</i>) in a cattle station near Dandenong, but the venture
did not pay, and the partnership was dissolved, Mr. Johnston
persuading Mr. Wilson to take to literary pursuits. Subsequently
the two purchased the Melbourne <i>Argus</i> in equal
co-partnership. The new venture did not at first pay better than
the cattle station, and in 1852 Mr. Johnston sold his share to Mr.
Gill, who resold it to Mr. Lauchlan Mackinnon, whose interests Mr.
Johnston subsequently represented in the management of the

the greater part of his scientific education in the Andersonian
University, Glasgow, where he studied botany, geology, and
chemistry, under Professors Kennedy, Crosskey, and Penny. In 1870
Mr. Johnston emigrated to Australia, and in the same year was
engaged by the Tasmanian Government Railway Commissioners to
initiate a system of accounts and audit for the Launceston and
Western Railway. He was head of the account and audit department of

he was selected by the Government to organise a new statistical
department, and received the appointment of Government Statistician
and Registrar-General for Tasmania. Mr. Johnston is the author of
the "Tasmanian Official Record," published annually since 1890 by
the Government. This work, which is a cyclopedia of information
relating to the colony, has received high praise from competent
authorities for its completeness and scientific method. He has also
contributed to the Royal Society of Tasmania various papers on
statistical and economic questions. In addition to his work as a
statistician, Mr. Johnston has made important additions to the
knowledge of the geology and natural history of Tasmania. He has
published the result of his painstaking original observations,
extending over twenty years, in a series of contributions to the
Proceedings of the Royal Society of Tasmania (1881 to 1891),
dealing chiefly with palaeontology, stratigraphical geology, and
the sister sciences of zoology and botany. He is also the author of
"Field Memoranda for Tasmanian Botanists" (Launceston, 1874), and
"Descriptive Catalogue of Tasmanian Fishes" (Hobart, 1882). It is,
however, by his "Systematic Account of the Geology of Tasmania"
(Hobart, 1888), that Mr. Johnston is most widely known. This
elaborate work was published at the cost of the Tasmanian
Government, at whose request it was prepared. Mr. Johnston is a

Assembly under responsible government for Durham in 1856, and was
Colonial Treasurer under Mr. (afterwards Sir) Chas. Cowper, from
Sept. 1857 to Jan. 1858, when he resigned. In 1859 he was returned

<p><a name="A757" id="A757"></a><b>Kavel, Rev. August</b>, was
pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church at Klemzig in Prussia
from 1826 to 1835, when he resigned in consequence of his
conscientious objections to the liturgy by which the Prussian
Government sought to unite the Reformed and Lutheran Churches, and
which they forced on the unwilling congregations of both creeds.
Mr. Kavel's flock desiring to follow their pastor to some new
sphere, where freedom of worship would be insured, he made
preliminary arrangements with the South Australian Company for
their emigration to that colony. The Prussian Government, however,
refused passports, and owing to the delay, the negotiations fell
through. Mr. Kavel first saw Mr. Angas, the chairman of the
company, on the subject in April 1836, and after waiting patiently
for over a year the members of his congregation presented a
petition to the King, with the result that he instructed Dr.
Strauss, a councillor of the Consistory in Berlin, to proceed to
Klemzig, and use his best endeavours to bring the people back to
the Established Church. His mission totally failed, the people
remaining stedfast and immovable. Many of the ministers and
philanthropists of London joined together to expedite matters, and
proposed to call a meeting to ventilate the whole question. But Mr.
Kavel declined to be present, or to accept the well-meant
intervention, on the ground that claiming the political
interference of a foreign power was contrary to the Lutheran belief
in the teaching of Scripture, although it was not inconsistent for
them to leave a country where their religious freedom was
endangered. The proposed meeting was therefore abandoned. Not so
the scheme of emigration, which Mr. Angas ultimately agreed to
provide for at his personal expense, chartering the <i>Prince
George</i> for the purpose. The passports being at last
forthcoming, two hundred of Mr. Kavel's people embarked at Hamburg
on the <i>Prince George</i>, which finally left Plymouth in July
1838, arriving at Adelaide in November. The people were settled on
Mr. Angas' land, on the north bank of the Torrens, where they
founded a settlement called after their old home, Klemzig. The
expatriated Lutherans were eager to make their settlements models
of prosperity; but in doing so they omitted to make corresponding
efforts to discharge their pecuniary obligations to Mr. Angas, who
was placed in a most difficult position in consequence. Pastor
Kavel grieved at the scandal of having under his care a
congregation who had emigrated for conscience' sake, showing so
little regard to their conscientious duty, adopted the stringent
measure of refusing to administer the Lord's Supper to any who were
failing to make faithful efforts to pay their debts. For a time he
was a pastor almost without a flock, but the lesson he taught his
people resulted in their honourably fulfilling their engagements
and expressing their gratitude to Mr. Angas for his generous and
timely aid. Mr. Kavel, who took his parents to the colony with him,
died in 1859. He published a pamphlet setting forth the advantages
of South Australia as a field for settlement, which had a wide
circulation in Germany.</p>

<p><a name="A758" id="A758"></a><b>Kawepo, Renata</b>, a well-known
Maori chief, of Hawke's Bay, N.Z., took a prominent part on the
side of the English during the disturbances on the East Coast, and
distinguished himself on several occasions by his personal prowess.
In the same spirit in which he afterwards refused to stand for the
House of Representatives, and declined a seat in the Legislative
Council when it was offered to him by Sir Donald McLean, this chief
took the field as a volunteer with his people. The proffered rank
of major in the colonial forces had no charms for him, as he was
conscious that no mere creation of the kind could add to his
influence or dignity as one of the beads of his tribe. He was a
chief of the old school, proud and domineering, given to
hospitality on a lavish scale, and jealous of his people's rights.
He was a large landed proprietor, receiving a considerable share of
the rents in the Hawke's Bay district, and enjoying at the time of
his death, in 1888, an income of about £3,000 a year. He lived in a
good European house at Omahu, about twelve miles from Napier; but
he never altogether lost his relish for the Maori communal mode of
life. During the sittings of the Land Court, when large numbers of
natives were accustomed to assemble at his house, he divided his
hospitalities between champagne dinners to English visitors at the
best hotels and open-air feasts to his own countrymen. He was famed
all over the country for his lavish presents to neighbouring
chiefs. For his services at the attack upon Omarunui (Hawke's Bay),
where, under command of Colonel Whitmore, he led the
Ngatiteupokoiri into the thick of the fight, he received from the
Government a presentation sword. At the Porere fight, under Colonel
McDonnell, he lost his left eye, in consideration of which the
colony gave him a life pension of £100 a year. At his death he left
behind a property estimated as being worth a quarter of a million
sterling, and there was much litigation over his will, the matter
being finally settled by Her Majesty's Privy Council in favour of
William Broughton, his adopted half-caste son. Renata, like many of
the old chiefs, was an accomplished speaker and a keen debater. He
took an active interest in the religious instruction of his people,
and insisted on defraying himself the entire cost of the small
church at Omahu. His remains are interred at Omahu, and on the
anniversary of his death his people are accustomed to assemble from
various parts of the district to discuss his good qualities and to
mourn his loss. A graceful tribute to the high character of this
chief was placed on record by Judge Kenton in his famous judgment
in the Pukehamoamoa case.</p>

<p><a name="A759" id="A759"></a><b>Keene, William</b>, was born at
Bath, England, in 1795. Having superintended the working of some
salt mines in the Pyrenees for the French Government, he migrated
to New South Wales in 1852, and in 1856 was appointed Government
Geologist and Examiner of Coal Mines. He died in Sydney on Feb.
2nd, 1872.</p>

<p><a name="A760" id="A760"></a><b>Keepa, Major</b>, N.Z.C., a
Maori chief (more generally known as Major Kemp), is the son of
Tanguru and Rereomaki, and possesses paramount influence in the
Wanganui district of New Zealand. He figured prominently during the
Maori war, always fighting on the side of the colonists, was often
mentioned in despatches, received a sword of honour from her
Majesty, and was decorated with the New Zealand Cross for personal
valour in the field. The character of the man may be gathered from
the following remarks of Dr. (now Sir Walter) Buller, who presented
to him at Wanganui, on behalf of the Government, the New Zealand
war medal:&mdash;"I think I may venture to say that, among all who
have received this honourable badge, there has been no more worthy
recipient than our staunch friend and ally Major Kemp, the son of
Tanguru, and therefore a high-born chief of the Wanganui River
related on his mother's side to the Ngatiapa Rangitane and Ngarauru
tribes, own nephew to the late Hori Kingi, that good old chief who
was the consistent friend of the pakeha and the guardian of peace
in this district. I well remember that when I first came to the
district, in 1804, Kemp had just received a commission as an ensign
or lieutenant in the native contingent under Captain (now Colonel)
McDonnell. After performing good service at Pipiriki, Kemp was
ordered, with the rest of the contingent, to Opotiki, for the
purpose of breaking up a Hauhau combination there and avenging the
murder of the Rev. Mr. Volkner. On his return from that expedition,
he served with McDonnell under General Cameron, and subsequently
under Major-General Chute, throughout the campaign on the West
Coast He assisted Sir George Grey at the taking of the Wereroa pa;
and he afterwards fought under Colonels McDonnell and Whitmore,
distinguishing himself on all occasions by his daring courage....In
recognition of his services, he was first promoted to the rank of
captain, and afterwards to that of major; and Colonel McDonnell has
on frequent public occasions borne testimony to his intrepidity and
valour. When the rebellion had been crushed on the West Coast, Kemp
was instructed by the Government to organise an expedition into the
interior for the pursuit of Te Kooti and his band of murderous
fanatics. Of this force he took the chief command himself, and
became known among the natives as 'General Kemp.' Starting from the
head waters of the Wanganui, he pursued the enemy across the
Murimotu plains to the East Coast, and thence back into the Ohiwa
mountains, where, after much hard fighting, he succeeded in
breaking up and dispersing Te Kooti's band." General Whitmore
stated in the Legislative Council that he was personally worth any
two hundred ordinary men in the field. Major Kemp still lives at
Wanganui, where he devotes himself principally to the elucidation
of the tribal titles in the Native Land Court.</p>

<p><a name="A762" id="A762"></a><b>Kemble, Myra</b> (Mrs. White),
was born in Ireland, but was taken in early life to Australia,
where she was educated at the Geelong Convent School in Victoria,
so that she is generally ranked among Australian-born artistes,
amongst whom she is one of the most popular and capable. For some
years she held the place of "leading lady" in various companies,
and has been equally a favourite in all the cities of Australia and
New Zealand. In 1890 Miss Kemble paid her first visit to England,
when she purchased the colonial "rights" of <i>Dr. Bill</i>, by
Hamilton Aidé, and other pieces. During her sojourn in London Mr.
Robert Buchanan wrote a play, entitled <i>Man and the Woman</i>,
specially for the popular colonial actress, who produced it at a
<i>matinée</i> at the Criterion, where, however, despite excellent
acting, it did not prove successful. After Miss Kemble's return to
Sydney she made a brilliant reappearance at the Criterion Theatre
in that city in Dr. Bill, and she has since been touring in the
various colonies.</p>

<p><a name="A763" id="A763"></a><b>Kendall, Henry Clarence</b>, the

in 1842. He went to sea in a South Sea whaling ship, and was
afterwards clerk to a lawyer. He commenced his literary career by
contributing poems to the <i>Empire</i> newspaper in Sydney, and
one or two of his pieces found admission to the London
<i>Athenæum</i>. In 1862 he published "Poems and Songs," which he
suppressed in 1865, owing to what he regarded as their crudity. In
1863 he obtained a situation in the New South Wales Lands Office,
and was subsequently employed in the Colonial Secretary's
Department, but resigned in 1869; and went to Melbourne, where he
contributed largely to the press, and gained a prize for the best
poem on an Australian subject. He was prominently associated with
Marcus Clarke, George Gordon McCrae, and other Melbourne
<i>littérateurs</i>, in the attempt to establish a high-class
literary magazine, the <i>Colonial Monthly</i>, which, however,
proved a failure. He also, in conjunction with Mr. C. E. Horsley,
composed the cantata for the opening of the Melbourne Town Hall.
Mr. Kendall subsequently returned to New South Wales, and wrote the
cantata for the opening of the Sydney International Exhibition in
1879. He published two other volumes&mdash;"Leaves from an
Australian Forest" and "Songs from the Mountains," the former his
<i>chef d'oeuvre</i>. He was much indebted throughout his life to
the friendship of Sir Henry Parkes, who conducted the
<i>Empire</i>, in which his maiden efforts at versification
appeared. He married, in 1867, a daughter of Dr. Butter, of
Woolloomooloo, Sydney. Mr. Kendall died at Redfern, near Sydney, on

member of the Provincial Council of Canterbury, and in 1870 he
became a leading member of the Provincial Government, holding the
offices of Provincial Secretary and Secretary for Public Works from
Oct. 1870 to Jan. 1874. While Secretary for Public Works, the
construction of the first railways, under Sir Julius Vogel's Public
Works scheme, came under his charge, and the contract for the
important harbour works at Lyttelton was entered into. Mr. Kennaway
while in office framed and carried through the Provincial
Legislature an education ordinance providing for a non-sectarian
system of education, which was worked with most successful results;
and the Canterbury College, School of Agriculture, and other

endowed with over 300,000 acres of land. Amongst other offices
which Mr. Kennaway held in the colony may be named Commissioner of
Crown Lands, Governor of the Canterbury College, and member of the
Board of Education. In 1874 he accepted the appointment of
Secretary to the Department of the Agent-General in London, and
this office he still holds. Mr. Kennaway was one of the
commissioners for New Zealand for the Colonial and Indian
Exhibition of 1886; and in 1889, for his services in connection
with the International Exhibition at Paris, he received from the

was born at Parramatta, N.S.W., in 1817, and entered the Royal
Navy, serving under his father and Captain (afterwards Admiral)
Fitzroy, in the <i>Adventure</i> and <i>Beagle</i>. Having retired
from the navy, he joined the staff of the Australian Agricultural
Company at Port Stephens; and on the formation of the Peel River
Company, in 1854, he was appointed manager. In Dec. 1880 Mr. King
was called to the Legislative Council of New South Wales. He
married in 1843 Elizabeth, eldest daughter of the late Hannibal H.
Macarthur, nephew of the late John Macarthur of Camden Park, whose
name is associated with the founding of the merino wool industry in
Australia.</p>

daughter of Mr. Combes, of Bedford, was born at Norfolk Island,
where his father was Lieut.-Governor, on Dec. 13th, 1791, being, it
is asserted, the first child of European parents born
there&mdash;though this can scarcely have been the case if the
commonly received date of William Charles Wentworth's birth is

engaged in surveying the northern coasts of Australia in the ships
<i>Mermaid</i> and <i>Bathurst</i>. During this period he made no
less than four separate expeditions, all of which he commanded.
Subsequently (1825 to 1830) he was engaged with Admiral Fitzroy in
surveying the South American coasts in the ships <i>Adventure</i>
and <i>Beagle</i>. He obtained post rank in Feb. 1830, and,
retiring from the navy, settled permanently in New South Wales,
where he had been appointed in his absence in 1829 a member of the
Legislative Council, and where he acted as manager of the
Australian Agricultural Company. He was gazetted to the rank of
rear-admiral in 1855, and died in February of the following year.
In 1817 he married Harriet, second daughter of Christopher

<p><a name="A779" id="A779"></a><b>Kingsley, Henry</b>, son of the
Rev. Charles Kingsley, rector of Chelsea, and a brother of Charles
Kingsley, the author of "Westward Ho!" was born in 1830, and
educated at King's College, London, and Worcester College, Oxford,
which he left without taking a degree to go to Australia in 1853.
He remained five years in the colonies, and as the outcome of his
experiences produced what is considered the best novel of
Australian life, "Recollections of Geoffrey Hamlyn," published in
1859. In "The Hillyars and the Burtons," too, he drew on the same
sources of inspiration. The latter was published in 1865. Mr.
Kingsley was present as a war correspondent at the battle of Sedan,
and died in 1876.</p>

<p><a name="A780" id="A780"></a><b>Kingston, Hon. Charles
Cameron</b>, M.P., Q.C., son of the late Sir George Strickland
Kingston, sometime Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of South
Australia, by his marriage with Ludovina Catherine da Silva,
daughter of Lieut.-Colonel Charles G. Cameron, is a member of the
legal firm of Kingston &amp; Hall, of Adelaide, and has represented
West Adelaide in the Assembly since 1881. Mr. Kingston was born at
Adelaide on Oct. 22nd, 1850, and educated at the Adelaide
Educational Institution, where he highly distinguished himself. On
leaving school he was articled to Mr. Samuel James Way, and was
admitted to the Bar in 1873. He remained with Mr. Way till that
gentleman became Chief Justice in 1876, when he commenced practice
on his own account as a barrister and solicitor, and in 1889 became
Q.C. As a politician Mr. Kingston has consistently advocated
Protection and payment of members, and has closely identified
himself with all social reforms having for their object the
amelioration of the condition of the working classes. He held
office as Attorney-General in Mr. Colton's Ministry from June 1884
to June 1885, and in Mr. Playford's first Government from June 1887
to June 1889. Whilst a member of the Colton Government he drafted
the bill for the imposition of land and income taxes which was
passed by Parliament, and is still the taw of the land. As
Attorney-General in the same Government he introduced and carried
an Employers' Liability Bill, which is equal in liberality to any
similar measure in force in Australia. He also prepared and
succeeded in carrying a bill to amend the laws of inheritance
securing to the children of married women dying intestate a share
in the estate of their mother. Whilst a member of the Playford
Government he rendered valuable assistance in securing the adoption
of a protective tariff and payment of members. He is a strong
opponent of Chinese immigration, and with Mr. Playford he
represented South Australia at the Australasian conference on the
subject held at the instance of South Australia in Sydney in 1888,
when he drafted the bill for the regulation of the matter which was
agreed to by all the colonies represented, with the exception only
of Tasmania. He subsequently took a leading part in securing the
adoption of the bill by the South Australian Parliament. In 1888,
as Attorney-General in the Playford Government, he took charge of
the bill for securing the entry of South Australia into the Federal
Council, and after a severe struggle succeeded in securing its
adoption. With Mr. Playford he represented South Australia at the
session of the Federal Council held at Hobart in Feb. 1889, and his
colleague being elected President, he undertook the moving of
resolutions for enlarging the membership of the Council, to give
effect to wishes which were generally expressed in South Australia
when the adopting bill was under discussion. These resolutions were
successfully carried, and were approved by the South Australian
House of Assembly and by the Legislatures of all the federated
Colonies, but the hostility of a small majority of the South
Australian Legislative Council prevented their final adoption. On
the fall of the Playford Government in June 1889, Mr. Kingston
became a prominent member of the opposition to the Cookburn
Ministry, and on their overthrow in 1890 he was asked by his old
leader to take his former portfolio, but, in accordance with a
resolution previously expressed, he declined the offer, but
consistently supported the Playford Administration until he joined
them as Colonial Secretary in succession to Sir John Bray in Jan.
1892. He was acting Premier of the colony during Mr. Playford's
absence in India from Jan. to May of that year, and went out of
office with his colleagues when they were defeated on Mr. Holder's
want of confidence motion in June. During the session of 1891 he
prepared and introduced a bill designed for the settlement of
industrial disputes by means of boards of conciliation. This
measure is admittedly more complete than any which have been
previously introduced to the notice of any Australian legislature.
Mr. Kingston was practically unanimously elected by the members of
the South Australian House of Assembly as one of their delegates to
the Sydney Federation Convention. He has always consistently
advocated Australian federation for national purposes. In 1889, in
recognition of his political services, he was permitted to retain
the title of "Honourable" within the province of South Australia.
At the Sydney Convention he was one of the three draftsmen who
assisted Sir Samuel Griffith in the preparation of the bill for
constituting the commonwealth of Australia.</p>

Strickland</b>, son of George Kingston, of Bandon, Cork, Ireland,
was born in 1807, and arrived in South Australia with Colonel
Light, the first Surveyor-General, in August 1836. On the
resignation of Colonel Light in March of the next year, Mr.
Kingston was appointed acting Surveyor-General, and supervised most
of the early surveys of the colony. He was made Deputy Surveyor in
1838, Inspector of Public Works in 1839, and Town Surveyor in 1840.
He opposed the admission of convicts in 1845, and the granting of
State aid to religion in 1848. He was returned to the mixed
Legislative Council for the Burra in 1851, and to the first
Legislative Assembly in 1857, when he was elected the first
Speaker. This post he held from April 1857 till March 1860, when he
lost his seat. He was, however, again returned for the Burra, and
re-elected Speaker in March 1865, occupying the chair of the House
till Dec. 1880, during which period he had been five times
unanimously re-elected. He was knighted in 1870. Sir George married
first, in 1829, Harriet Ann Stuart, daughter of Captain Felix
MacDonough (who died in 1839); secondly, in 1841, Ludovina
Catherine da Silva, daughter of Lieut.-Colonel Charles G. Cameron
(who died the same year); and thirdly, Emma Mary Ann Catherine
Berry, daughter of Captain Thomas Lipson, R.N. He died at sea on

at Trinity College, Dublin, afterwards qualifying himself as a
civil engineer. The outbreak of the gold fever brought him to
Melbourne in 1852, and then to the Ovens, where he only remained a
short time, arriving in Ballarat in Feb. 1853, where he worked with
marked success until the troubles between the authorities and the
miners in Dec. 1854, in which Mr. Lalor bore a prominent part in
the interests of the latter. He was present at the meeting on
Bakery Hill, on Nov. 29th, when the obnoxious mining licences were
publicly burned; and he acted as commander of the contingent of
miners who guarded the Eureka stockade against the troops and
police commanded by Colonel (then Captain) Thomas, on Dec. 3rd,
1854. On this occasion he was wounded in the left arm, which was
subsequently amputated, and a price was set upon his head; but this
did not result in his apprehension, and his captured comrades
having in the meantime been acquitted, he was in 1855 elected one
of the first representatives of the Ballarat fields in the

<p><a name="A793" id="A793"></a><b>Landsborough, William</b>, was
the son of a Scotch medical man, was born in Ayrshire and educated
at Irvine. He went to Australia and commenced as a squatter in the
New England district of New South Wales, subsequently removing to
Queensland. He began a career of private exploration in 1856, and
discovered Mount Nebo and Fort Cooper. He explored the Peak Downs
and Nagoa in 1859, discovered the head of the Thomson in 1860, and
traced the Gregory and Herbert rivers to their sources in 1861. In
that year he was engaged by the Royal Society of Victoria to head
an expedition from the Albert River in search of Burke and Wills.
After several false starts the party left the depot on Feb. 10th,
1862, and journeyed southward, discovering rich pastoral land
extending along the waters of the Flinders to the Dividing Range,
thence along the Thomson, from its source to the Victoria River (or
Barcoo), and thence to the Warrego, whence they travelled by the
Darling and Menindie to Melbourne, where Mr. Landsborough was
presented with a piece of plate valued at £500, and, on his
subsequently visiting London, with a gold watch by the Royal
Geographical Society. After a tour in India and Europe he returned
to Queensland, and was elected to the Assembly, but resigned his
seat in 1865, and took the position of Government Resident in the
Bourke District. Subsequently, in conjunction with Mr. G. Phillips,
he discovered the Western River, and followed the course of the
Diamantina to its source. In 1868 he was removed from his
situation, and became Inspector of Brands for East Moreton. He died
on March 16th, 1886.</p>

<p><a name="A794" id="A794"></a><b>Lang, Rev. John Dunmore</b>,
D.D., one of the ablest pioneers of Australian autonomy, was born
at Greenock, in Scotland, on August 25th, 1799, and graduated at
Glasgow University, of which he was made D.D. in 1825. His
attention being early directed to Australia, then almost a terra
incognita, he determined to leave Scotland, and in Sept. 1822 was
ordained by the Irvine Presbytery minister for the Scotch National
Church in Sydney. He arrived in the metropolis of New South Wales
in 1823 and met with a warm welcome from his fellow-countrymen who
had settled there. The Courthouse was placed at his disposal for
holding services, and his preaching attracted what in those days
might be styled large congregations. Subscriptions were liberally
promised towards the erection of a church, the Governor, Sir Thomas
Brisbane, heading the list; but, in consequence of a quarrel, the
Governor declined to afford State endowment and withdrew his own
subscription. Dr. Lang, undaunted by the want of official
patronage, proceeded to build his church and went to England to lay
his complaint before the Secretary of State for the Colonies. He
was favourably received, and in 1826 returned to Sydney with a
direction from Earl Bathurst to the authorities in New South Wales
that one-third of the cost of the Presbyterian Church should be
paid by the State, and a salary of £300 a year paid to Dr. Lang out
of colonial funds. To him belongs the real honour of introducing
the Presbyterian church and school system into Australia. He was
instrumental in establishing the Australian College in Sydney in
1832, and to effect this object made considerable personal
sacrifices. Shortly after a visit to England in 1841 he joined the
Presbyterian Synod of Australia, but in the following year pursued
a course adverse to the views or the majority of the Synod, and was
censured for disregard of the authority of the Church by refusing
to appear when cited to answer charges made against him. He was
deposed from his ministerial office, and the deposition was
confirmed by the Church courts in Scotland. He applied for relief
to the Court of Session, and the Lord Ordinary held that the
decision was illegal. The Sydney Presbytery endeavoured to oust him
from the possession of Church property, but after a long course of
litigation the matter was, in 1862, finally decided in his favour.
He held the ministry of the Scots Church, Sydney, from 1823 until
his death. On Dec. 17th, 1872, he celebrated the jubilee of his
ministry; amidst universal congratulations. The position of Dr.
Lang as a politician in a great measure overshadowed his calling as
a minister of religion. From the time of his arrival in the colony
he took an active interest in social and public questions. In 1835,
dissatisfied with the colonial press which then existed, he started
the Colonist, a weekly journal, in which he advocated the
discontinuance of the system of granting waste lands to settlers,
and urged the adoption of the Wakefield principle of selling the
lands at an upset price and devoting the proceeds to immigration.
He maintained that the waste lands were not the property of the
inhabitants, but of the people of the British empire, and ought to
be administered in that spirit. His proposal met with some
acceptance, was recommended by a select committee of the
Legislative Council, and received the approval of Lord Glenelg, the
then Secretary of State for the Colonies; but a land system on a
different basis was afterwards established by Wentworth. Dr. Lang
was an ardent supporter of immigration. In 1830 he addressed a
letter to Viscount Goderich, pointing out the means of conveying
thousands of the distressed agricultural population of Great
Britain to the plenty of New South Wales without expense to the
mother country. His idea was to obtain the necessary funds by sales
of building allotments in Sydney, and by resuming and selling land
granted on conditions unfulfilled to the Church and School
Corporation of New South Wales. He published this letter in the
colony, and his proposal gave offence to the possessors of the land
he proposed to resume. A wordy warfare followed, lasting for years,
and the struggle entailed on him much expense and annoyance. He was
blamed by Lord Goderich for the indiscreet publication of the
letter, and the Legislative Council passed a vote of censure. In
1836 he brought out from England a supply of suitable ministers for
the Church, a number of schoolmasters and others, numbering with
their families about three hundred persons. He lectured on
immigration during his frequent visits to England, and used his
influence to promote the settlement of Protestant people in the
colony. The bounty system he condemned as calculated to unduly
encourage the introduction of Roman Catholics at the expense of the
State. In 1843 Dr. Lang was elected a member of the first
Legislative Council of New South Wales under the constitution of
1842. He was returned for the district of Port Phillip, now the
colony of Victoria. His principal aims in entering political life
were to put a stop to the preponderance of Irish Roman Catholic
immigrants and to secure for the colony a general system of
education adapted to its wants. On the latter question he had been
opposed to the Irish national system, but after a visit to Ireland
he changed his views and advocated its adoption. A select committee
of the Legislative Council, of which Mr. Robert Lowe (now Lord
Sherbrooke) was chairman, recommended the system. He was a foremost
actor in the movement for the separation of Port Phillip from New
South Wales. He broached the idea to the residents of Port Phillip,
who were labouring under a feeling of dissatisfaction at the
neglect they experienced from the central Government, and he
received such encouragement that in 1844 he proposed in the
Legislative Council of the mother colony the separation of Port
Phillip and its erection into a distinct colony. The six Port
Phillip representatives voted for the motion, but the only member
among the thirty representatives of New South Wales proper who gave
in their adhesion was Mr. Lowe. Not discouraged, Dr. Lang drew up a
petition, which was numerously signed, and sent home to her
Majesty. Lord Stanley gave a favourable reply, but separation was
not consummated until the year 1851. The services rendered by Dr.
Lang were recognised by the Victorian Parliament, who in 1872 voted
him a sum of £1000. He was also a warm advocate of the separation
of Queensland from New South Wales. His interest in the Moreton Bay
district dated back to the years 1848 and 1849, when he introduced
there at considerable personal expense about six hundred
immigrants. His services in the cause of separation were
acknowledged by the Queensland Legislature. He was also the
promoter of the land order system established in that colony. He
was always strongly opposed to the transportation system, the
agitation in regard to which lasted from 1846 to 1851, Earl Grey,
then Secretary of State for the Colonies, persisting in his
determination to force the system on the colony. Ultimately,
however, the order in Council declaring New South Wales a place
where convicts might be sent was revoked. Dr. Lang was elected
member for Sydney in 1850, defeating the transportation candidate.
In 1849 he addressed a letter to Earl Grey on the subject of his
misgovernment of the Australian colonies during the three years he
held office, couched in language which gave great offence, and
which openly threatened separation from the mother country and the
formation of an Australian republic In Sept. 1851 he was elected at
the head of the poll for Sydney, John Lamb and W. C. Wentworth
being his colleagues, but he resigned almost immediately and went
to England. During his absence a new Constitution Act was passed,
containing a clause rendering ministers of religion ineligible for
Parliament, and he was thus precluded from entering the Legislature
for a time. This clause was repealed in 1857, and at the general
election in 1859 he was again returned for Sydney. After the
introduction of responsible government he was elected three times
for Sydney West, twice at the head of the poll. He retired from the
Parliamentary arena in Nov. 1869. Among other measures advocated by
him during his political career were the extension and equalising
of the representation (in 1843), the establishment of a uniform
postage rate of twopence (in 1844), triennial Parliaments, a single
chamber Legislature, cheap and efficient railway communication, and
permanent discontinuance of State aid to religion. In 1839 he
visited New Zealand and wrote to Lord Durham urging the Government
to take possession of those islands. During his long connection
with Australia he visited England nine times. In 1846 he was
examined before a committee of the House of Commons on the question
of transportation. Dr. Lang was a voluminous writer. He is the
author of a history of New South Wales, which ran through four
editions, the first issued in 1834, the latest in 1875. His other
works are?"Origin and Migration of the Polynesian Natives" (1834);
"Transportation and Colonisation" (1837); "New Zealand in 1839:
Position and Prospects of its Inhabitants"; "Religion and Education
in America" (1840); "Cook's Land, Australia" (1847); "Phillip's
Land" (1847); "Freedom and Independence for Australia" (1852); "The
Coming Event" (1876); "Aurora Australis," a series of poems (1826).
He was also a ready pamphleteer, and wrote on a variety of
subjects. "The career of Dr. Lang," writes Mr. Blair in his
admirable "Cyclopaedia," "embraces a period of very great interest
to Australians. He saw the foundations of a nation laid, and was an
instrument in the work. He was witness of the wonderful progress
and prosperity of the colonies, and did not pass away until he had
seen the handful of settlers ripen into a community numbering
nearly two millions and the continent explored and settled
throughout the eastern half. He lived through the viceroyalties of
nine Governors of New South Wales, commencing with Sir Thomas
Brisbane and ending with Sir Hercules Robinson. He was a man of
indomitable energy, of liberal views, of considerable ability, of
great public spirit, and utterly careless about pecuniary
advantage. He achieved a position among the early colonists of
Australia which will not readily be forgotten." Dr. Lang died in
Sydney on August 8th, 1878, and was accorded the tribute of a
public funeral.</p>

Kent, on Jan. 2nd, 1828, and emigrated to Victoria in 1852. He
early distinguished himself as an unflinching opponent of fiscal
protection, and in 1859 he lectured at Fitzroy in favour of the
retention of free trade. In face of the rising tide of protection
he unsuccessfully contested Collingwood in 1859 and 1861, East
Melbourne in 1861, East Bourke Boroughs in 1864, and Dundas in
1865. At length, in Jan. 1866, his perseverance was rewarded, and
he succeeded Mr. Kyte as member for East Melbourne. He exchanged
that constituency for West Melbourne at the general election in
1868, and continued to sit until 1877, when he was defeated. In May
1868 Mr. Langton, who was a staunch Conservative as well as a
Free-trader, became Treasurer in Sir Charles (then Mr.) Sladen's
short-lived Ministry, and occupied the same post, with the
additional office of Postmaster-General, in the Francis Government,
from June 1872 to July 1874, when he resigned with his colleagues.
Mr. Langton has written much for the Melbourne press, and was one
of the earliest proprietors of the Spectator, a free trade organ
started in 1865. He was secretary of the Free Trade League of
Victoria from its commencement until 1866, has been an honorary
member of the Cobden Club since 1874, and is a trustee and

the age of seventeen he emigrated to Sydney, N.S.W., where he
engaged with great success in squatting and mercantile pursuits. In
1845 he married Jane Elizabeth, daughter of William Walker, a
prominent Sydney merchant. In the following year he became a
director of the Bank of New South Wales, and was chosen president
in 1852. On the discovery of gold in Australia in 1851, Mr.
Larnach, in conjunction with his colleagues, entered largely into
the purchase of the precious metal on account of the Bank, and in
1852 doubled the capital out of profits. In the latter year he
returned to England and became manager of the London branch, in the
founding of which he was the active spirit. He retained his
connection with the management of the Bank of New South Wales for
twenty-five years, and on his retirement was elected Chairman of
the London Board of the Bank. In 1858 he became a director of the
London Joint Stock Bank, and is also on the board of the Indemnity
Mutual Marine Insurance Company. Whilst the Bank of New South Wales
held the agency of that colony, its monetary affairs were conducted
with great success by Mr. Larnach, who is regarded as one of the
leading financial authorities in the city of London. [This

Bank of New Zealand). In 1866 he was returned to the House of
Representatives for Dunedin; and in 1877, having carried a vote of
no-confidence against the Whitaker-Atkinson Ministry, he joined the
administration formed by Sir George Grey on Oct. 14th as Colonial
Treasurer and Minister of Public Works. Subsequently he went to
England in connection with a Colonial loan, but returned in 1880,
the Grey Government having in the meantime been ousted. In the same
year he re-entered Parliament. Mr. Larnach was Minister of Mines
and of the Marine in the Stout-Vogel Government, which entered
office on Sept. 3rd, 1884, and went out on Oct. 8th, 1887. Mr.

<p><a name="A800" id="A800"></a><b>Latrobe, Charles Joseph</b>,
C.B., first Governor of Victoria, was descended from a Swiss
family, which emigrated from the south of France at the Revocation
of the Edict of Nantes, and originally settled in Ireland. Mr.
Latrobe himself was, however, a native of Yorkshire, where his
father, the Rev. C. J. Latrobe, officiated as a Moravian minister.
His mother was the daughter of a Yorkshire clergyman of the name of
Sims. He was educated for the Moravian ministry, but ultimately
abandoned the idea of an ecclesiastical career. He early evinced a
taste for travel, and as the result of his experiences in Europe
and America published two works entitled "The Alpenstock" and "The
Rambler in Mexico." He became companion to a foreign count, and in
that capacity accompanied Washington Irving in his well-known tour
of the American prairies. He subsequently attracted the attention
of Lord Glenelg, and in the year of the Queen's accession was
despatched to the West Indies by the Melbourne Ministry to report
on the application of the funds voted by Parliament for the
education of the emancipated negroes. Having given satisfaction in
this service, he was appointed in 1839 Superintendent of Port
Phillip, as the present colony of Victoria was then denominated.
Though then but a district of New South Wales, great inconvenience
was, even in those primitive times, experienced in administering
its affairs from the distant seat of government at Sydney. The
office of Superintendent was, therefore, created, with a view to
the local administration of local affairs, subject to the control
and approval in all important matters of the Governor for the time
being of the parent colony. Mr. Latrobe arrived in Melbourne on
Sept. 30th, 1839, and two days later was presented with an address
of congratulation from the colonists at a reception held in the
Auction Company's rooms in Collins Street. The salary was at first
only £800 per annum, but this was ultimately increased to £1500. In
Oct. 1846 Mr. Latrobe was commissioned to proceed to Tasmania, to
report on the state of that colony subsequent to the suspension of
Governor Sir J. Eardley Wilmot; and in this capacity administered
the government for a few months. On the question of the exclusion
of convicts from Victoria, Mr. Latrobe took the popular side; but
on that of the concession of representative institutions to the
district he aroused virulent opposition by a despatch dated August
1848, in which, while he gave a modified support to the idea of
separation from New South Wales, he argued that the new colony
would for a long time to come be unfitted to control its own
affairs through an elective Parliament Against these sentiments the
Melbourne City Council?which had in the previous June petitioned
the Queen for the Superintendent's recall, on the ground that he
had opposed their being entrusted with the public works expenditure
of the colony?bitterly protested. Neither petition nor protest,
though the former was backed up by resolutions passed at a public
meeting attended by three thousand colonists, had much effect in
discrediting Mr. Latrobe with the Colonial Office, as was shown by
his appointment as first Lieutenant-Governor on the separation of
the colony from New South Wales in July 1851. This post he held
through the trying times which followed on the discovery of gold
till May 1854, when he retired, and returned to England. Mr.
Latrobe married, in 1835, the third daughter of M. de Montmolen, of
Neufchatel, in Switzerland, who died on Jan. 30th, 1854, in
England, whither she had proceeded in advance of her husband, who
did not leave Melbourne till May 5th. Mr. Latrobe, who may be
regarded as the founder of the Melbourne University, and of many of
the public institutions on which the inhabitants of Victoria now
pride themselves, died in London on Dec. 2nd, 1875.</p>

secretary to Sir George Grey, the Governor, whom he accompanied in
the same capacity to New Zealand, retaining his rank in the Cape
Service. In 1862 he was appointed Arbitrator to the mixed British
and Portuguese Commission at the Cape of Good Hope for suppressing
the slave trade, and Arbitrator in the mixed court at the Cape of
Good Hope, between Great Britain and the United States, for
suppressing the African slave trade. He was promoted to be judge in

Islands in 1873. In August of the latter year he was appointed, in
conjunction with Commodore Goodenough, to investigate the proposed
cession of Fiji to the British Crown, and in March 1874 they
presented a report embodying the terms of cession offered by the
native chiefs and approved of by the European inhabitants. These,
however, proved unacceptable, and the annexation was subsequently
negotiated by Sir Hercules Robinson. Mr. Layard was administrator
of the government of Fiji from 1874 to 1875, and has been Consul

course, in the first instance, to Mount Buninyong, near to which,
in conjunction with his brother, Somerville Livingstone Learmonth,
Mr. T. L. Learmonth subsequently entered on pastoral pursuits on

Secretary to the Commissioners of Victoria at the Exhibitions of
New South Wales (1870), Melbourne (1872, 1875, and 1880-81), London
and Vienna (1873), and Philadelphia (1876), and Acting Executive
Commissioner at the Paris Exhibition in 1878 (C.M.G. and Legion of

<p><a name="A820" id="A820"></a><b>Leys, Thomson Wilson</b>, was
born of Scottish parentage in 1850 at Nottingham, where his father
was Supervisor of Inland Revenue. He was five years a pupil at the
People's College, Nottingham, and emigrated to New Zealand in 1863
with his parents, who joined the great Nonconformist movement to
establish a special settlement at Albertland, north of Auckland.
After arrival in New Zealand, he was apprenticed in the printing
office of the Southern Cross, the oldest and most influential
journal in the colony at that period. Three years later he obtained
a transfer to the literary staff as shipping reporter, and in 1870,
at the age of twenty, became sub-editor of the Daily Southern Cross
and Weekly News, which were then owned by Mr. (now Sir Julius)
Vogel, Colonial Treasurer. Compelled by ill-health to relinquish
night work, he resigned and joined the editorial staff of the
Auckland Star, assuming the chief editorship in Feb. 1875, a
position which he still retains, having also acquired a partnership
interest in that paper, the New Zealand Farmer, New Zealand
Graphic, and the large printing and publishing business connected
with those journals. In the scant leisure which falls to the lot of
the editor of a daily newspaper, Mr. Leys has done much literary
work. He contributed the Auckland section of Sir Julius Vogel's
"New Zealand Handbook", edited the "Early History of New Zealand,"
covering the period from the earliest times to 1845, and also the
"Colonist's Guide," a standard textbook for settlers in New
Zealand. He has also edited for sixteen years the annual issues of
the Auckland Almanack, a valuable compendium of statistical and
descriptive matter relating to New Zealand. Being one of the party
formed at Rotorua on the day after the Tarawera eruption to visit
Rotomahana and ascertain the condition of the Terraces, he wrote a
graphic description of that great volcanic outburst, which was
published in separate form. Among his minor literary works are a
brochure on "The Doctrine of Evolution," in reply to Professor
Denton, and notes of a holiday excursion to the South Sea Islands,
"The Cruise of the Wairarapa". In 1891 Mr. Leys represented a
syndicate of New Zealand journals at the Federation Convention in
Sydney.</p>

<p><a name="A821" id="A821"></a><b>Ligar, Charles Whybrow</b>,
sometime Surveyor-General of Victoria, was born in 1809 at Ceylon,
where his father was stationed with his regiment. Educated at the
Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he received a commission in the
Royal Engineers, which he shortly afterwards resigned. He was
employed on the Ordnance Survey of Ireland until 1840, when he was
appointed Surveyor-General of New Zealand by Lord John Russell.
Being wrecked at the Cape of Good Hope, he did not arrive in New
Zealand until the end of 1841. In the latter colony he purchased a
vast quantity of land from the Maoris for the European settlers,
and was appointed colonel and commandant of the New Zealand
Militia, in which capacity he took part in the war at the Bay of
Islands. He retired from the position of Surveyor-General of New
Zealand in 1856, and after residing for a short time in the
southern portion of that colony, went to Victoria in 1857 as land
commissioner for the province of Otago. In 1858 he became
Surveyor-General of Victoria, retiring on a pension in 1869. He
then returned to Europe, but finally settled in Texas, where he
embarked in stock-raising. Mr. Ligar married in 1839 Grace,
daughter of Thomas Hanyngton, of Dungannon, Tyrone, and
granddaughter of the Earl of Charlemont, and in 1869 Marie,
daughter of the late Captain Williams, of Auckland, N.Z. He died in
1879.</p>

<p><a name="A822" id="A822"></a><b>Lilley, Hon. Sir Charles</b>,
Chief Justice of Queensland, is the son of the late T. Lilley, of
Newcastle-on-Tyne, where he was born on May 27th, 1830, and
received the chief part of his education at University College,
London. He was articled to an eminent London solicitor. He arrived
in Moreton Bay in 1856, and re-entered upon the profession of the
law as an articled clerk to Mr. Robert Little, Crown Solicitor, and
was editor and joint lessee of the Moreton Bay Courier, in
partnership with Mr. C. Belbridge. On the separation of the colony
from New South Wales, Mr. Lilley was elected member for Fortitude
Valley, which electorate he continued to represent until the end of
his parliamentary career. In 1861 he was called to the bar, and in
1865 appointed Q.C. In September of the same year he became
Attorney-General in the Herbert Ministry, and continued to hold
that office under Mr. Macalister's premiership until July 1866. Mr.
Herbert came into power again for another month, with Mr. Pring for
his Attorney-General; but in August, when Mr. Macalister was
reinstated, Mr. Lilley returned to his old post, and held office
till August 1867. He became Premier and Attorney-General in Nov.
1868, and whilst in power established free education throughout the
colony. In May 1870 he resigned, in consequence of Parliament
censuring him for having ordered the building of the steamer
Governor Blackall without Parliamentary sanction. In 1874 he was
appointed a judge of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice in June 1879,
and was knighted by patent in 1881. Sir Charles Lilley has always
taken a very active part in educational matters, and is at present
chairman of trustees of the Brisbane Grammar School, an institution
he was mainly instrumental in founding. He was chairman of the
Royal Commission on Education, which resulted in the adoption of
free, secular, and compulsory education. He was also the means of
the Queensland Judicature Act being passed. Sir Charles Lilley has
recently headed a movement for the establishment of a Queensland
University. Sir Charles was one of the most active advocates of the
separation of Moreton Bay from New South Wales, and its formation
into the separate colony of Queensland. He now seems equally
desirous to see Australia severed from the United Kingdom, some
letters which he has recently published embodying the sentiment of
Australian nationalism in its most extreme form. They have
attracted considerable attention, owing to the outr&eacute;
language in which they are couched, and also owing to the fact that
no colonial public man of anything like Sir Charles Lilley's
standing has as yet taken up similar ground. He is also the most
thorough-going advocate of the claims of the "Labour" party among
all the prominent public men of Australia; and in laying the
foundation of the Trades Hall, Brisbane (1891), he delivered a most
sympathetic and outspoken address. As Premier, Sir Charles Lilley,
who at any rate has the courage of his convictions, discouraged the
popular borrowing policy, and refused to take office in 1874 under
Mr. Macalister. He married in 1858 Sarah Jane, daughter of Joshua
Jeays, sometime Mayor of Brisbane.</p>

<p><a name="A823" id="A823"></a><b>Lindauer, Gottfried</b>, a
well-known artist who has made Maori studies his specialty, was
born at Pilsen, Bohemia, on Jan. 5th, 1839. Having early in life
developed a taste for drawing, he was sent, at the age of
seventeen, to Vienna as a resident student at the Academy of
Artists, where he remained till 1865, studying in succession under
Professor Joseph Freheich, Professor Kuppelwiesa, and Professor
Rohl. After leaving the academy he was engaged for two years
painting frescoes in the Cathedral churches of Austria. Then he
went to Russia, where he remained two years, devoting himself
exclusively to portrait-painting. Returning to Vienna in 1869, he
painted some well-known public men, including Bishop Jieschek, of
Budweis, in Bohemia. After a sojourn in that city of eighteen
months, he went to Moravia for three years, and then migrated to
New Zealand, arriving in the colony in May 1874. Devoting himself
principally to Maori portraiture, he travelled through the colony
and painted the prominent men and women of a generation now passing
away. The series of life-size portraits of Maori chiefs and
warriors exhibited by Sir Walter Buller at the Colonial and Indian
Exhibition, 1886, were all from his hand, who had made the "Maori
at home" a subject of special study. After visiting his native land
in 1886-87, he settled down at Woodville, near Wellington, having
shortly before married Rebecca, the daughter of Benjamin Prance
Petty.</p>

was curate of St. Mark's, Cheltenham, from 1867 to 1870, vicar of
Holy Trinity, Oxford, from 1870 to 1877, vicar of St. Philip's,
Norwich, from 1877 to 1884, in which year, on the formation of the
see of Riverina, he was appointed the first bishop, being
consecrated in St. Paul's Cathedral on May 1st, 1884. Bishop
Linton, who was created an honorary D.D. of Oxford in 1884, and who

and being present at the battle of the Nile, he was appointed
acting lieutenant of the Sabrina, Jan. 1808; and in the following
year senior lieutenant of a corvette on the South American station,
where he greatly distinguished himself, and was awarded a medal and
two clasps. In 1836 he went to South Australia, with the
appointment of Naval Officer of the colony. He subsequently became
Collector of Customs for South Australia, and Harbour Master at
Port Adelaide, but resigned the former post in 1840, retaining his
other appointments till 1855, when he retired on a pension. Captain
Lipson made several surveys of the South Australian coast for the

G.C.M.G., was the eldest son of Sir William Young, 1st baronet of
Bailieborough Castle, co. Cavan, and a director of the East India
Company. He was born at Bailieborough Castle on April 30th, 1807,
and educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he graduated
B.A. in 1829. He represented the county of Cavan in the House of
Commons from 1831 to 1855. In 1834 he was called to the bar, and in
the following year he married Adelaide Annabella, daughter of the
late Marchioness of Headfort by her first husband, Edward Tuite
Dalton. Lady Lisgar survived him, and married secondly, in 1878,
the late Sir Francis Fortescue Turville, K.C.M.G. Sir John Young
held a minor office in the English Ministry in 1841, succeeded his
father in the baronetcy in 1848, and was Chief Secretary for
Ireland in 1852. In 1855 he was appointed Lord High Commissioner of
the Ionian Islands, and held that position till their cession to
Greece in 1859. In Jan. 1861 he was appointed Captain-General and
Governor-in-Chief of New South Wales, the title of
Governor-General, borne by his predecessors, being discontinued
from this time forth. Sir John arrived in Sydney in March 1861; but
as the patent of his appointment was not forthcoming, he acted as
Administrator only until May, when the necessary document arrived.
During the political crisis occasioned by the struggle over the
Robertson Land Bill, Sir John Young adopted the advice of his
ministers with regard to the creation of sufficient new councillors
to carry the measure over the heads of the majority in the Upper
House. The course adopted did not meet with the approval of the
Colonial Office; but his term of office, which expired in Dec.
1867, was on the whole successful, and he himself popular. From
1868 to 1872 he was Governor-General of Canada, and in 1872 was
created a peer of the United Kingdom, as Baron Lisgar of Lisgar and
Bailieborough. Lord Lisgar died on Oct. 14th, 1876, without male
issue, when the peerage became extinct, and the baronetcy devolved
upon his nephew.</p>

accompanied Sir Stratford Canning (afterwards Viscount Stratford de
Redcliffe) on his special mission to the Courts of Berlin, Vienna,
Munich, and Athens in March 1848. He was appointed Secretary of the
Legation at Stuttgart in 1852 and in Berlin in 1853, and Envoy
Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Vienna in March 1858.
In August of the same year he was sent to represent the Queen at
the marriage of his Serene Highness Prince Leiningen with the
Princess Mary of Baden at Carlsruhe. In Dec 1860 Lord Augustus was
transferred to Berlin. On the elevation of the mission in Berlin to
the rank of an embassy he was removed, on Oct. 28th, 1862, to
Munich, which was on that occasion raised to the rank of a
first-class mission. He was created K.C.B. on Dec. 12th, 1862, was
promoted to be Ambassador Extraordinary and&nbsp;plenipotentiary to
the King of Prussia on Jan. 19th, 1866, and was made G.C.B. on July
6th, 1866. Lord Augustus was appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and
Plenipotentiary to the North German Confederation on Feb. 24th,
1868, was sworn of the Privy Council on Nov. 11th, 1868, and was
appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the
Emperor of Russia on Oct. 16th, 1871. The latter post he held till
Feb. 1879, when he was appointed Governor of New South Wales, where
he remained till 1885, when he was succeeded by Lord Carrington.
Lord Augustus Loftus took an active part in the despatch of the New
South Wales contingent to the Soudan, and indeed it is doubtful
whether he may not claim to have been the author of the project for
offering colonial aid to the imperial authorities on this occasion.
Lord Augustus retired on a pension, and resides in England. He
married on August 9th, 1845, Emma, daughter of Admiral Henry
Francis Greville, C.B. In 1892 he published his "Diplomatic
Reminiscences". [This biography appeared in the <b>Supplement</b>

Longmore, a farmer in Monaghan, Ireland, where he was born in 1826.
He was educated at Mr. Blackey's Presbyterian Academy, Monaghan,
and in 1839 went to Australia with the members of his family, who
settled in New South Wales, where he followed farming pursuits till
1851, when he started business in Sydney as a commission agent. The
next year he removed to Victoria, where since 1854 he has farmed
land in the Learmonth district. In 1856 Mr. Longmore began to take
an active part in public affairs, being a strong opponent of the
abuses of the land system. In 1861 he stood for the county of Ripon
and Hampden, but was defeated by Mr. J. Service. In 1864 he was
successful against another opponent. In the Assembly he
distinguished himself as a strong Liberal, Protectionist, and land
reformer. He held office as Commissioner of Railways and
Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works under Mr. (now Sir)
Charles G. Duffy from June 1871 to June 1872, and was Minister of
Lands under Mr. (now Sir) Graham Berry from August to Oct. 1875. In
the second Berry Government, which lasted from May 1877 till March
1880, he held the same position, distinguishing himself as a
Minister by his vehement opposition to squatting and support of
small settlement. Mr. Longmore was defeated for Ripon and Hampden
in 1883, and has not re-entered Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="A833" id="A833"></a><i>Lonsdale, Captain William</i>,
first Colonial Secretary of Victoria, was originally an officer of
the 4th Regiment, but after arrival in Sydney entered the Civil
Service of the colony, and was employed as a police magistrate. In
1836, when measures were required for the preservation of order in
the newly formed settlement, he was despatched by the Governor of
New South Wales, Sir R. Bourke, with the appointment of police
magistrate at the future Melbourne. He went to his new location in
H.M.S. Rattlesnake, commanded by Captain William Hobson, afterwards
first Governor of New Zealand, after whom Hobson's Bay, on which
Melbourne stands, was named. In September Port Phillip was formally
opened to settlement, and Lonsdale was instructed to form a bench
of magistrates, to protect the natives from all manner of wrong, to
pension Buckley (q.v.) the wild white man found amongst the blacks
by Batman in the previous year, and generally to supervise the
disposal of the public lands, to which previous unauthorised
occupation was to give no prior claim at the sales which were to be
carried out. In March 1837 Governor Bourke himself visited the
settlement, and was received by Lonsdale, who was appointed
sub-treasurer and was acting Superintendent of Port Phillip during
the absence of the Superintendent, Mr. Latrobe, in Tasmania from
Oct 1846 to Jan. 1847. When Port Phillip was separated from New
South Wales in 1851, Captain Lonsdale was appointed first Colonial
Secretary of the new colony of Victoria, as it was now called. He
was also an ex-officio member of the Executive Council, and in Nov.
1851 was appointed by Governor Latrobe an official member of the
semi-elective Legislative Council, his colleagues being Mr.
(afterwards Sir) William Stawell, Mr. C. H. Ebden, Mr. (afterwards
Sir Redmond) Barry, and Mr. R. W. Pohlman, all since deceased.
Captain Lonsdale was Colonial Secretary during the perturbed times
of the gold discovery until he was replaced by Mr. J. F. L. Foster
in July 1853. He then returned to England, where he died.</p>

August 5th, 1818, and educated under Dr. Halloran and Mr. Cape.
From 1837 to 1850 he resided in the Wellington district, and
occupied himself in squatting pursuits. He was elected to the first
Legislative Assembly of New South Wales for the Bogan in 1856, and
continued to represent the constituency till 1877, when he accepted
a nomination to the Upper House, in which he remained till his
death. Mr. Lord, who was for many years a director of the
Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, held the office of Colonial
Treasurer in Sir James Martin's third Ministry, from Dec. 1870 to
May 1872. He died on May 9th, 1880.</p>

Victoria in 1853, and founded the firm of Lorimer, Mackie &amp;
Co., agents for the White Star Line, the designation of the firm
being subsequently changed to Lorimer, Marwood &amp; Rome, and more
recently to Lorimer, Rome &amp; Co. Sir James in his early
political career was a Liberal-Conservative and free trader,
entering the Legislative Council, in which he held a seat till his
death, for the Central Province in 1878. He was twice President of
the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, and was the first Chairman of
the Melbourne Harbour Trust. In Feb. 1886, when the Gillies
Ministry was formed, he accepted the post of Minister of Defence,
and was sworn of the Executive Council. In the next year he was
associated with Mr. Deakin and Sir Graham Berry as one of the
Victorian representatives to the Colonial Conference in London, and
was created K.C.M.G. during his visit. Whilst in England he did
much useful work in connection with defence matters. He died in

<p><a name="A839" id="A839"></a><b>Lowe, Right Hon. Robert</b>,
G.C.B., LL.D., D.C.L., F.R.S., first Viscount Sherbrooke, formerly
a New South Wales colonist, was the second son of the late Rev.
Robert Lowe, rector of Bingham and prebendary of Southwell,
Nottinghamshire, by his marriage with Ellen, daughter and
co-heiress of Rev. Reginald Pyndar, rector of Madresfield,
Worcestershire. Mr. Lowe was born at Bingham in Dec. 1811, and
educated at Winchester School and at University College, Oxford,
where he graduated as a first in classics in 1833, and was elected
a Fellow of Magdalen College in 1834. After a highly successful
career as a private tutor at Oxford, he was called to the Bar at
Lincoln's Inn in Jan. 1842, and throwing up his Oxford appointment,
emigrated to New South Wales. On Oct. 18th on the motion of the
Attorney-General, Mr. Lowe was admitted a barrister of the Supreme
Court of that colony, but briefs came so slowly that it was
rumoured he would give up practice altogether. No public notice was
taken of his arrival beyond the fact that he was the guest of
Governor Gipps, and for fourteen months he remained in complete
obscurity. Then, to the surprise of every one, in Nov. 1843 he was
nominated by the Governor as a member of the Legislative Council.
At this period the struggle for obtaining representative government
was proceeding vigorously, under the powerful leadership of Mr. W.
C. Wentworth. Mr. Lowe's first speech was made on the Monetary
Confidence Bill brought in by Mr. Windeyer to alleviate the
financial depression by circulating land debentures. It was against
the measure, and excited universal admiration by its brilliancy and
wit. This success was followed up by another speech on the third
reading of the same measure, which passed the Council,but the
vigorous opposition it met with emboldened the Governor to withhold
the assent of the Crown. Mr. Lowe's attack called up Wentworth, the
leader of the Opposition, who taunted him with his support of the
authority which had given him legislative power. He acknowledged
that "the efforts of the hon. member from Horbury Terrace, smelling
of the lamp as they did, and highly considered as they were, were
nevertheless efforts of no small merit." Then he alluded to his
antagonist's want of experience. "All the opposition emanated from
persons who were comparative strangers to the land, ignorant of its
wants, ignorant of its history, and ignorant, in short, of
everything connected with it." On Dec. 16th of the same year, Mr.
Lowe brought up the report of a committee on the insolvency law,
and earnestly and eloquently urged the abolition of imprisonment
for debt, a measure which subsequently became law, and was the
distinguishing feature of the first session of the Council. He
vigorously opposed Mr. Wentworth's proposal to increase the duty on
flour from one shilling to half a crown, and also the proposal to
admit natives as witnesses in criminal cases. His oration in the
latter debate was considered a masterpiece of oratory. Soon
afterwards an affair occurred which brought Mr. Lowe still more
prominently, but less favourably, before the public. Dr. Lang; who
had been ejected by the local Presbyterian Synod, brought the
temporalities of the Presbyterian Church under review in connection
with the disruption of the Church of Scotland. In discussing this
question of ecclesiastical law, Mr. Lowe thought proper to indulge
to the full his extraordinary powers of sarcasm and personal
invective. He jeered at Dr. Lang for proposing to bring before the
House the conduct of the Executive of the Australian Library,
which, though aided by Government funds, had blackballed a certain
Alderman Macdermott. This unlucky allusion was the cause of much
trouble, for Mr. Macdermott, after reading the speech, sent a
friend, Dr. Macfarlane, to ask for an explanation. This Mr. Lowe
refused to give, as he considered himself privileged as a member of
the Legislature. Next day the same gentleman reappeared at his
chambers with a certain Captain Moore, and demanded an apology or
satisfaction. Mr. Lowe refused to apologise, and declined a duel on
three grounds:?(1) that he was not responsible for his words in the
Council except to the Council; (2) he did not consider Macdermott
his equal; (3) he was always bound to keep the peace. Not content
with this, he at once filed an affidavit detailing the
circumstances, and appeared at the police court, where Macdermott,
Dr. Macfarlane, and Captain Moore were bound over to keep the
peace. These disagreeable incidents were brought before the Council
at its next sitting, and a committee was appointed to consider
them. This was the first case of "privilege," and it was a source
of great perplexity. The committee were of opinion that the Council
had not the power to deal directly with the offender, but
recommended that an Act should be passed securing this right. In
the present case they proposed that the Attorney-General should
prosecute Macdermott and his friends in the courts of law. These
recommendations were carried after a long discussion by fifteen
votes to thirteen, Mr. Lowe voting in the majority, and the
prosecution accordingly was commenced, but fell through on
technical grounds. Meanwhile public opinion was roused on the
subject. At the request of a huge number of citizens, the Mayor
called a public meeting, and resolutions were passed against the
appropriation of public money for the purpose of the prosecution
and condemning the proposed legislation as oppressive and unjust.
For the time Mr. Lowe was the most unpopular man in the colony, and
the Council for the action it had taken shared in the opprobrium.
On August 21st, 1844, Dr. Lang, then one of the members for the
Port Phillip district, moved a resolution affirming the
desirability of the separation of what subsequently became the
colony of Victoria from New South Wales. This secured the unanimous
adhesion of the six members for the district, but Mr. Lowe was tho
only other member who gave them his support and vote. He hoped the
time was not remote when Great Britain would give up the idea of
treating the dependencies of the Crown as children who were to be
cast adrift from their parents as soon as they arrived at manhood,
and substitute for it the far truer and nobler policy of knitting
herself and her colonies into one mighty confederacy, confident
against the world in arts and arms." The most important task before
the Council was the assertion of constitutional rights in
connection with the lands of the colony. Mr. Cowper had obtained a
committee on Crown lands grievances, of which Mr. Lowe was a
member. The Council, ably led by Wentworth, Lowe, and Cowper, never
rested until it obtained the distinct declaration that the Crown
lands should be subject to the control of the local Legislature. A
matter more particularly connected at this time with Mr. Lowe's
name was popular education. He had obtained a committee and brought
up a report recommending the introduction of Lord Stanley's Irish
scheme. This report at once raised a storm. The Anglican bishop
summoned a meeting of Churchmen, which was adjourned and lasted
over two nights. The clergy were opposed-to anything but a
denominational system pure and simple. The friends of a general
system induced the Mayor to convene a town meeting. Mr. Lowe on
coming forward to move the first resolution was howled down with
cries of "Privilege! privilege!" The meeting was so disorderly that
the Mayor adjourned it until next day. This adjourned meeting was
quite as rowdy, but at length on a third day the opponents of Mr.
Lowe's views stayed away, and able speeches were delivered in
support of the recommendations of the committee. The Catholics held
a meeting, under the presidency of their bishop, at which the
proposals were temperately discussed, but they were adverse to the
new scheme. The Council, in spite of the clamour on the part of the
denominationalists, approved the committee's report. In successive
sessions Mr. Lowe continued to press forward the subject, and in
1846 he succeeded in passing a resolution authorising the formation
of a national board. After Mr. Lowe had completed his education
report, he resigned his seat as a nominee member of the Council.
When he was first appointed he was inexperienced in colonial
politics, and his sympathies were with the Colonial Office. He
expected that he could give a general support to the Government,
though he was in no way pledged to do so. The Colonial Office had
authorised the formation of district councils, with powers of
taxation for local objects. Sir George Gipps thoroughly approved of
this, and in spite of the objection that the population of the
colony was then too sparsely scattered for the councils to be
anything but an intolerable burden, he endeavoured to force them on
an unwilling people. Mr. Lowe became one of the bitterest opponents
of this pet scheme of Sir George Gipps. He also had a personal
difference with the Governor respecting the admission to his
entertainments by the latter of a guest of dubious reputation. He
did not, however, resign his nominee seat until Mr. Roger Therry
had denounced him in the Council as an adder which had stung to
death the benefactor who had warmed it in his bosom. Before the
commencement of the next session, Mr. Lowe was again a member of
the Council, this time as the elected representative of the
district of St. Vincent. His opposition to the action of the
Governor and his condemnation of the squatting regulations had won
him the support of squatters and settlers alike. His oratorical
triumphs in the Assembly had brought him a considerable practice at
the Bar. In defending the prisoner Knatchbull he made use of an
argument which drew upon him the charge of fatalism, and the press
attacked him for this somewhat unfairly. He defended himself with
great spirit. In conjunction with William Forster and others, he
started a weekly paper, the Atlas, which waged incessant war
against the Government, and particularly against the Governor.
Article after article full of constitutional learning, enriched
with classical and historical allusions, assailed with relentless
logic the unconstitutional position of the Governor and the
Colonial Office. At length Sir George Gipps left the colony. Mr.
Lowe in opposing him had allied himself with the squatting party;
but when the new Governor arrived, the independent party who, in
the first session of the Council, had joined with the squatters in
demanding for them fixity of tenure as a protection from the
encroachments and impositions of the Crown, were now equally loud
in denouncing their threatened monopoly of the land of the colony.
In truth, on the land question Mr. Lowe altered his views more than
once, and thus incurred the charge of inconsistency. But he
steadfastly opposed the squatting monopoly. Were the broad lands
that could support millions to become a mere sheep-walk for the
benefit of the few? This was the question which, supported by a
small minority in the House and amid the indifference of the people
outside, he propounded to his fellow-colonists with a vehemence,
persistency, and eloquence that has never been surpassed. These
efforts did not by any means absorb all Mr. Lowe's energies during
the session of 1847. At its commencement he spoke with great effect
on the bill for amalgamating the two branches of the legal
profession. At the conclusion of the session he called attention to
the incipient slave trade with the islands of the Pacific. Already
employers of labour had begun the system of importing Polynesians,
which subsequently led in some instances to deplorable results,
calling for criminal prosecutions and legislative interference, In
1848 he opposed Earl Grey's proposal to constitute the Assembly by
the election of local corporations or councils, and supported the
bicameral system. At the general election he was triumphantly
returned for Sydney as colleague to Wentworth, and amidst great
rejoicings at the success of the popular party, of which he was now
the acknowledged leader. Wentworth on this occasion attacked him on
the hustings with great incisiveness, urging the electors to return
Dr. Bland as his colleague in preference to Lowe, who had himself
been a party to the compromise on the transportation system, which
he then denounced. Mr. (now Sir Henry) Parkes was one of Lowe's
warmest supporters. In 1849 he strenuously opposed Earl Grey's
malign project for renewing transportation, and also the conduct of
Sir Charles Fitzroy in seconding Earl Grey's efforts in spite of
the repeated and passionate remonstrances of the people. On August
1st Mr. Lowe spoke at great length on the Budget, urging the House
to use finance as the lever with which to force the British
Parliament to grant them a responsible Government. The next month
he brought up the report of a committee on the Sydney Corporation.
The report proposed its abolition, and the speech in which Mr. Lowe
moved the adoption of this recommendation manifested hostility not
merely to the Sydney body, but to corporate institutions generally.
The Land Committee's report was also drawn up during the session.
It was palpably in the main Mr. Lowe's own composition, and pointed
out that many of the positions taken up by the advisers or the
Government were simply due to their absolute ignorance of all local
conditions. During the session Mr. Lowe had given his support to
Wentworth's proposals to establish a university in Sydney, but on
the last day of the session he combated certain details, and
suggested further consideration until the beginning of the next
session. This led to a challenge from Dr. Bland (q.v.), which,
however, ended harmlessly. During the debates on the Constitution
Mr. Lowe had given no indications of any intention to leave his
adopted country, but in the spring he determined to return to the
old land, and to seek power and distinction in the broader fields
of English political life. He left New South Wales in 1850. His
subsequent career as an English statesman till his elevation to the
peerage as Viscount Sherbrooke in 1880 forms no part of Australian
history. The collection of his poems published in 1884 contains
many pieces having reference to colonial life and politics. Lord
Sherbrooke married first, in 1836, Georgiana, second daughter of
George Orred, of Aigburth House, Liverpool. She died in Nov. 1884,
and the following year he married Caroline, daughter of the late
Thomas Sneyd, of Ashcombe Park, Stafford. In the House of Commons
Mr. Lowe, as he then was, took an active part in the discussion of
the legislation by which responsible government was conferred on
the colonies of Victoria and New South Wales, especially condemning
the stipulation by which a two-thirds majority was rendered a
condition precedent of constitutional changes, and which, greatly
owing to his influence, was expunged. By 1866, however, his views
had altered, and instead of denouncing the oligarchical rule of a
plutocracy in the colonies, he advocated the abolition of
responsible government and universal suffrage, arguing in favour of
a recurrence to the Crown system of government. Lord Sherbrooke
owned much valuable property in Sydney. He died at Warlingham,
Surrey, on 27th July, 1892.</p>

in 1832, and subsequently M.A. After some journalistic experience
as a colleague of Charles Dickens, on the Morning Chronicle, he was
called to the bar in 1840, and went the Oxford circuit; but finding
his health impaired, he decided to emigrate to Australia, and,
after suffering shipwreck, landed in Sydney in Dec. 1853. Having
entered the Legislative Council, he was Solicitor-General in the
first Cowper Ministry from Sept. to Oct. 1856, and represented the
Government in the Upper House. He was again Solicitor-General in
the second Cowper Administration from Sept. 1857 to Nov. 1858, when
he succeeded Mr. (afterwards Sir) James Martin as Attorney-General.
This post he resigned in Feb. 1859, and was appointed in the
following October Resident Judge of what was then the Moreton Bay
district of New South Wales. Two months later he became sole Judge
of the new colony of Queensland, and occupied the bench unaided
until the arrival of the first Chief Justice, Sir James Cockle, in
Feb. 1863. He died in Brisbane on June 12th, 1880. But for a
certain lack of self-restraint in his judgments and utterances, Mr.
Lutwyche would himself have been appointed the first Chief Justice
of Queensland, and he keenly felt the disallowance of his
claims.</p>

he went to Queensland, and was amongst the first to take up
squatting country on the Gulf of Carpentaria. Returning to
Tasmania, he was clerk to the Glamorgan Municipal Council till

<p><a name="A847a" id="A847a"></a><b>Lyster, William Saurin</b>,
son of Captain Chaworth Lyster, and godson of the Hon. William
Saurin, then Attorney-General for Ireland, was born in Dublin in
1827. After an adventurous youth, visiting Australia in his
boyhood, and afterwards serving as a volunteer under the famous
buccaneer Walker of Nicaragua, William Saurin Lyster finally
settled in Melbourne, bringing with him a full high-class operatic
company; and could claim the honour of introducing Italian opera
into Australia, although there had been excellent operatic singers
before his time in Sydney. Lyster's first operatic company included
Madame Lucy Escott, who retained for many years undisputed sway as
the favourite prima-donna&mdash;a gifted singer and a fine tragic
actress; Miss Georgia Hodson (afterwards Mrs. Lyster); Madame
Rosalie Durand; Henry Squires, the popular tenor; and Mr. Fred
Lyster, brother of the&nbsp;impresario. Such an undertaking was no
light one in those days; but Lyster not only introduced the above
artistes, but continued to bring out, from time to time, other
brilliant singers, who have left a name in the musical annals of
Australia. Among these may be named Madame Fanny Simonsen, an
admirable vocalist and actress, equally at home in classic opera or
opera-bouffe, and her husband, the excellent violinist. These are
specially named, not only on account of their excellence as
artistes, but because they settled down in the colonies, and became
in course of time Australians. In partnership first with Mr. John
Smith, and then with Signor Cagli, Lyster introduced to the
colonial public a succession of brilliant Italian singers; while
two of their conductors, Herr Siede and Signor Zelman, remained,
like the Simonsens, in Australia, and continued to brighten
colonial existence by their musical talent. Mr. Lyster also
introduced the celebrated pianiste, Madame Arabella Goddard, as
well as Levey, the famous cornet-player. In addition to
acclimatising Italian opera, he organised English companies for the
production of favourite ballad operas and adaptations of French
opera-bouffe. Among these English companies were singers of the
highest merit, but none so identified with operatic art in
Australia as Mr. Armes Beaumont, the popular tenor, who for almost
twenty years has held an unique position in the estimation of
Melbourne audiences as the favourite in oratorio, in classical
opera, in opera-bouffe, and on the concert platform. For many years
Mr. W. S. Lyster was the lessee of the Opera House, Melbourne; and
it was at this theatre, and under Mr. Lyster's management, that the
great Italian tragédienne, Madame Ristori, and her company
appeared. He died on Nov. 26th, 1880. [This biography appeared in

<p><a name="A850" id="A850"></a><b>Macalister, Hon. Arthur</b>,
C.M.G., sometime Premier of Queensland, was born in Glasgow, where
he studied for the legal profession. He emigrated to New South
Wales and settled in the Moreton Bay district of that colony (now
Queensland) in 1850. He represented Ipswich in the New South Wales
Parliament until severance, of which he was one of the most active
promoters, took place, when he refused a seat in the Queensland
Legislative Council and was returned to the Legislative Assembly
for his old constituency of Ipswich. When Mr. (now Sir) Robert
Herbert formed the first responsible ministry, Mr. Macalister was
included in it as Secretary for Lands and Works, and held office
from March 1862 to Feb. 1866, when Mr. Herbert retired, and he
himself became Premier. In the following July, however, he
resigned, owing to the refusal of the Governor to assent to his
method of overcoming the financial crisis by making notes legal
tender. Mr. Herbert again took the helm, but retired in eighteen
days, when Mr. Macalister resumed office as Premier and Colonial
Secretary. Having been again relegated to private life in August
1867, Mr. Macalister acted as Chairman of Committees of the
Legislative Assembly during the greater part of 1868. In November
of the same year he joined the Lilley Government as Secretary for
Lands and Secretary for Public Works. In Jan. 1869 he resigned the
former post, but continued to administer the Public Works
Department till the fall of the Ministry in May 1870. From Nov.
1870 to June 1871 Mr. Macalister was Speaker of the Legislative
Assembly, but lost his seat at the general election which followed.
In 1873 he was re-elected for Ipswich and again became Premier,
with the Portfolio of Colonial Secretary in Jan. 1874. In this
ministry, both Sir Thomas McIlwraith and Sir Samuel Griffith were
included. In June 1876, in which year he was created C.M.G., Mr.
Macalister resigned to take up the position of Agent-General in
London, which post he held till his death, in 1882.</p>

<p><a name="A851" id="A851"></a><b>Macandrew, James</b>, M.H.R.,
was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1820, and whilst still a youth
went to London, where he engaged in business. He took great
interest in the scheme for the settlement of Otago, N.Z., by the
Free Church of Scotland. Eventually he decided to cast in his lot
with the settlement; and, having purchased an iron schooner, he and
his family set sail in 1850 for his new colonial home. He very soon
commenced to take an active part in public affairs, and his
enterprise in starting new industries of various kinds led to the
establishment of shipbuilding. Mr. Macandrew introduced the first
merchant steamer, and was one of the members of the first Otago
Provincial Council and of the first House of Representatives, being
elected to the former for the Dunedin country district in Sept
1853, and being continuously a member of the latter body for
Dunedin City and Port Chalmers down to his death in 1887. In 1860
he became Superintendent of the Province of Otago, and served four
terms, holding office until the provinces were abolished in spite
of strenuous opposition in 1876. In the first General Assembly Mr.
Macandrew, in 1854, was one of the members of the Executive Council
appointed by Acting Governor Wynyard without portfolio; out it was
not Until 1877 that he held office again, when (in October) he
became Minister of Lands in Sir George Grey's Cabinet, a portfolio
which he subsequently exchanged for the Ministry of Public Works.
The Grey Government went out of office in Oct. 1879. Mr. Macandrew
was the founder of the Otago University, and the originator of the
Panama and Californian mail services, and, indeed, of steam
communication by sea in New Zealand. In 1884 he ventilated a plan
for settling the Highland crofters on the lands of the colony. Mr.
Macandrew was the Father of the House of Representatives at the
time of his death, which took place on Feb. 24th, 1887, as the
result of a carriage accident, when a fund was raised for his
family, and several public memorials were organised to perpetuate
his memory.</p>

settlement at Port Phillip had been definitely organised, Mr.
Macarthur was sent there to open a branch of the Bank of
Australasia in Melbourne, and did so towards the end of the year in
a small two-roomed house in what is now Little Collins Street. In
1854 Mr. Macarthur was one of a small committee appointed by the
Governor of Victoria, Sir Charles Hotham, to inquire into the state
of the finances, and concurred in the report which recommended the
abolition of the imprest system. Down to 1878 Mr. Macarthur was
Superintendent of the Bank of Australasia, and on his retirement
was made managing director in Australia. He died on Nov. 15th,
1887.</p>

after some time spent in the Lord Chamberlain's department, served
on the staff in Ireland from 1837 to 1841, when he became
lieut.-colonel, and was gazetted Deputy Adjutant-General in
Australia. In 1854 he became colonel, and the next year was
appointed Commander of the Forces in the Australian Colonies, in
which capacity he administered the government of Victoria during
the interregnum which followed on the death of Sir Charles Hotham,
from Jan. to Dec. 1856. Having become lieut.-general in 1856, he
was appointed colonel of the 100th Foot in 1862. Sir Edward

home on a visit, in 1805, and assisted the latter in the
development of the merino wool industry. In 1812, whilst on a visit
to England, he married Anna Maria, eldest daughter of Captain
Philip Gidley King, R.N., sometime Governor of New South Wales. For
some years he was police magistrate of Parramatta, and was one of
the first members of the first Legislative Council appointed by the
Crown. When the elective system was introduced he was returned for
Parramatta. He died at Norwood, in Surrey, on March 6th, 1861. Mrs.

twice previously visited, taking with him petitions to the king and
parliament on transportation, immigration, and representative
institutions; and in the following year published in London, "New
South Wales: its Present State and Future Prospects." On his
return, in 1839, he became a member of the Legislative Council; but
in 1843 was defeated for Cumberland by Mr. (afterwards Sir) Charles
Cowper, whom he had assisted Mr. Therry to defeat in the
neighbouring constituency of Camden. Subsequently Mr. Macarthur
declined a nominee seat. In 1848 he was elected for Camden to the
new Council, in which he sat for five years. In 1853 he moved the
resolution which empowered Mr. Wentworth and Mr. Deas Thomson to
advocate the new Constitution Act in England. He was returned to
the Assembly for West Camden in 1859, but retired on the ground of
ill-health; and at this time declined the offer of knighthood made
to him through Sir William Denison. In 1860 Mr. Macarthur, who was
one of the pioneers of the Australian wine industry, revisited
England, where he acted as a member of the International
Statistical Congress and Commissioner of the Exhibition of 1862. He
returned to New South Wales in 1864, and died on April 21st, 1867.
In 1838 he married Emily, second daughter of Henry Stone, of
Lombard Street, London. His only daughter, Elizabeth, married the

pastoral pursuits, but was a member of the Legislative Council of
New South Wales from 1849 to 1855, in which year he acted as a
Commissioner of the colony at the Paris Exhibition. For his
services thereat he received a knighthood and the decoration of the
Legion of Honour, and returned to the colony in Nov. 1857. Sir

<p><a name="A858a" id="A858a"></a><b>McCombie, Hon. Thomas</b>, who
was a native of Scotland, was a very prominent man in the early
days of the colony of Victoria, or, as it was then called, Port
Phillip. In 1845 he was a member of the committee appointed at a
public meeting held in Melbourne on Sept. 28th to frame a petition
to the Imperial Parliament in opposition to the proposal of New
South Wales to pledge the credit of Port Phillip for an immigration
loan for her own benefit. Mr. M?Combie was one of the first members
of the Melbourne Town Council. In 1846 he took an active part in
exerting pressure on the Superintendent of Port Phillip,
Mr.&nbsp;Latrobe, to expend the moneys voted by the Sydney
Legislature for public works in Melbourne,&nbsp;and which Mr.
Latrobe had withheld owing to his distrust of local administration.
On June 15th Mr. M?Combie submitted the following motion to the
Council, which was carried by nine votes to five: "That the
Legislative Committee be instructed to prepare an humble petition
to her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen praying for the removal of
Charles Joseph Latrobe, Esq., from the office of Superintendent of
the district of Port Phillip on account of his systematic
mismanagement of the money voted for the service of the province,
his neglect of public works of paramount consequence, and his
repeated breaches of faith in his official transactions with this
Council in matters of high public importance." On August 3rd
following Mr. M?Combie presided at a great public meeting held in
Melbourne, when a resolution was carried for the despatch of a
petition to the Home Government for the removal of Mr. Latrobe. The
petition was courteously acknowledged, but not acted on. In 1848
Mr. M?Combie took an active part in what was known as the
non-election movement, under which it was proposed to abstain from
sending members from Port Phillip to the Sydney Legislature. As,
however, a local candidate persisted in standing for the city of
Melbourne, Mr. M?Combie proposed the nomination of Earl Grey, and
he was returned by a large majority. In the outside districts the
non-electionists were not so successful. They put the Duke of
Wellington, Lords Palmerston, Brougham, and John Russell, and Sir
Robert Peel in nomination for the five seats, but in the result
five local candidates were returned. On the subject of these
proceedings Mr. M?Combie addressed lengthy letters to Mr. Hawes,
the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, and to Lord John
Russell. He also took an active part in the anti-transportation
movement, subscribing a hundred guineas towards the funds of the
Australasian League in 1851. Though Mr. M?Combie had been one of
the most prominent advocates of the separation of Port Phillip from
New South Wales, he was not elected to the mixed Legislative
Council when in 1851 the colony of Victoria was constituted. In
1856, however, when responsible government was conceded, Mr.
M?Combie was returned to the Upper House for the South Province. He
was a member of the second&nbsp;O'Shanassy&nbsp;Ministry without
portfolio from March 1858 to Oct. 1859. Latterly Mr. M?Combie
eschewed public life, and was connected with the press in Geelong.
He was the author of "New Plan of Colonial Government" (1845);
"Waste Land Acts Considered" (1846); "Australian Sketches,"
reprinted from&nbsp;Tait's Magazine&nbsp;(1847); "History of the
Colony of Victoria" (London, 1858). He died in Victoria. [This

M.D., was born in Dublin in 1823, and educated originally for the
medical profession, attending lectures, hospital practice, etc., in
Dublin and Cambridge. While yet too young to be admitted to the
profession, he devoted himself entirely to the study of various
branches of natural science, classifying the collections of the
Geological and Royal Societies of Dublin, with the object of
applying recent zoology to palaeontology as the basis of
stratigraphical geology. He then accepted the offer of Sir Richard
Griffith to make the palaeontological investigations required for
the geological map of Ireland for the Boundary Survey, publishing
the results in a large quarto volume in 1844, with numerous plates
of several hundred new species, entitled "Synopsis of the
Carboniferous Limestone Fossils of Ireland," and a smaller one in
1846, "Synopsis of the Silurian Fossils of Ireland." He was then
invited by Colonel Sir Henry James, R.E., and Sir Henry de la Beche
to join the Imperial Geological Survey of Ireland. He was appointed
by Sir Robert Peel's Government one of the first professors of the
Queen's University in Ireland, the chair of geology and mineralogy
at Belfast being assigned to him. About this time he undertook, in
conjunction with Professor Sedgwick, the large work on paleozoic
rocks and fossils, based on the materials in the Woodwardian
collection at Cambridge, and made a critical examination of the
great series of fossils of the older formations brought together by
Professor Sedgwick, the results of these labours being deemed
worthy of publication by the syndics of the University Press of
Cambridge in a large quarto volume, with numerous plates of new
discoveries in the Carboniferous, Devonian, Silurian, and Cambrian
formations, issued in 1852 as the second volume of a proposed joint
work (of which the first volume, to have been on the rocks, by
Professor Sedgwick, was never published) entitled "British
Palaeozoic Rocks and Fossils," by Professor Sedgwick and Professor
McCoy. He was then appointed by Sir J. Herschel and the Astronomer
Royal, Sir G. B. Airy, as the first Professor of Natural Science in
the University of Melbourne, where, having taken part in the
formation of the university, he lectured on chemistry and
mineralogy, botany, comparative anatomy and zoology, and geology
and palaeontology for upwards of thirty years. He also established
the National Museum of Natural History and Geology in Melbourne, of
which he is director, raising it to a distinguished position by the
extent of the collections and the perfection of the classification.
He was chairman of the first Royal Commission on the Goldfields of
Victoria, a member from the first of the Royal Commission on
Technical Instruction, a member of the Royal Commission on
Education and of the various Royal Commissions for International
and Intercolonial Exhibitions of Victoria. He was appointed
Government Palaeontologist at the early stage of the Geological
Survey, determining the ages of the various tracts depicted on the
maps. For over thirty years he has prepared, and continues to
publish in decades at short intervals, two works for the Government
of Victoria, one entitled "Prodromus of the Zoology of Victoria,"
with coloured figures from the life, and another "Prodromus of the
Palaeontology of Victoria." He was elected a Fellow of the Royal
Society of London in 1880, created one of the first Doctors of
Science honoris causa by the University of Cambridge; and the Royal
University of Ireland also conferred on him their highest degrees
in arts and sciences. He was created a Knight or Chevalier of the
Royal Order of the Crown of Italy by King Victor Emanuel, and has
been offered similar distinctions by other foreign sovereigns in
recognition of his scientific work, and in 1886 received the
decoration of C.M.G. from her Majesty, being promoted to be
K.C.M.G. in 1891. He also received the Emperor of Austria's great
gold medal for arts and sciences, the Murchison medal from the
Geological Society of London, and other similar distinctions. He
was elected one of the few (only thirty British subjects being
eligible) honorary members of the Cambridge Philosophical Society.
He has published about a hundred memoirs on every branch of zoology
and palaeontology in the Annals of Natural History and other

<p><a name="A863" id="A863"></a><b>McCrae, George Gordon</b>, is
the eldest son of the late Andrew Morison McCrae, at one time a
Writer to the Signet in Edinburgh, who emigrated to Sydney in 1839,
but afterwards settled in Port Phillip, where he abandoned his
profession, and took up a station at Arthur's Seat, Mornington. Mr.
McCrae, sen., relinquished squatting in 1851, on being appointed
police magistrate and Goldfields Warden at Kilmore, and died about
1874. Mr. George Gordon McCrae's mother, whose maiden name was
Georgiana Huntly Gordon, was a woman of remarkable general ability
and culture, and an admirable artist. She was born in London in
1804, and married Mr. McCrae, sen., in 1830, arriving in Hobson's
Bay with her children on March 1st, 1841. She died at Hawthorn,
near Melbourne, on May 24th, 1890. Mr. G. G. McCrae's uncle, Dr.
Farqahar McCrae, formerly of the Enniskillen Dragoons, was one of
the first medical men to start practice in Melbourne. Another
uncle, Captain Alexander McCrae, of her Majesty's 84th Regiment,
was the first Postmaster-General of Victoria. George Gordon McCrae
was born at Anchorfield, Leith, Scotland, on May 29th, 1833, and
received the principal part of his education from a private tutor
at Arthur's Seat, his father's station. When about sixteen he went
into a merchant's office in Melbourne, but only remained a year,
and tried banking, but ultimately entered the Victorian Civil
Service in Jan. 1854, in which he holds the position of Deputy
Registrar-General, Senior Examiner of Patents, and Registrar of
Copyrights. In the same year Mr. McCrae joined the Volunteer force,
and served eight years. In 1864 he revisited Scotland, and spent
some time in France. In 1871 he married Miss Augusta Helen Brown;
and in 1887 he occupied a second leave of absence in exploring
Mauritius, the Seychelles, and Bourbon. Mr. McCrae was in intimate
association with the literary circle typified by the names of R. H.
Horne, Henry Kendall, Lindsay Gordon, and Marcus Clarke. He has
contributed largely to the colonial press, most of his verses
appearing in the Melbourne Australasian, and a large number of
pieces, prose and verse, in Sydney Athenaeum and Critic and
Centennial Magazine. He contributed a naval novel, "Afloat and
Ashore; or, the Story of Oginski" to the Sydney Mail, and "Under
the Yellow Flag," a quarantine experience in the Seychelles, to the
Sydney Echo, He has published in book form, "Balladeadro and Mamba"
(Dwight: Melbourne), and "The Man in the Iron Mask," a poetical
romance (George Robertson: Melbourne), also "A Rosebud from the
Garden of the Taj," in the Melbourne Monthly Magazine.</p>

<p><a name="A864" id="A864"></a><b>McCulloch, Hon. Sir James</b>,
K.C.M.G., sometime Premier of Victoria, is the son of the late
George McCulloch, of Glasgow, where he was born in 1819. Having
embraced mercantile pursuits, he became in 1853 a partner in the
firm of J. &amp; A. Dennistoun, of Glasgow, and proceeded to
Melbourne, where, in conjunction with Mr. Robert Sellar, he opened
the house of Dennistoun Bros. &amp; Co., in connection with the
Glasgow firm, which had also branches in London, Liverpool, New
York, and New Orleans. In 1862 the firm of Dennistoun Bros. &amp;
Co. of Melbourne was wound up, and Sir James (then Mr.) McCulloch
founded a new firm in Melbourne in connection with that of
Leishman, Inglis &amp; Co., of London, with Mr. Robert Sellar as
partner, under the style of McCulloch, Sellar &amp; Co., of which
firm he is still the senior member. In 1854 he became a nominee
member of the old Legislative Council, and in 1856 he was elected
to represent the Wimmera electorate in the first Legislative
Assembly. In April of the following year he formed a Government, in
which he took the portfolio of Minister of Trade and Customs,
leaving the Premiership to the late Mr. Haines, with the office of
Chief Secretary. Sir James retired with his colleagues in March
1858, and visited England; but having been re-elected to the
Assembly on his return, he accepted the post of Treasurer in the
Nicholson Administration, which lasted from Oct. 1859 to Nov. 1860.
After another visit to England he was returned for Mornington in
1862, and in June of the following year became Premier of the
colony of Victoria as Chief Secretary, and for the last four years
of its existence Postmaster-General in a Ministry which held the
reins under circumstances of extraordinary turmoil until May 1868.
Mr. (now Sir) George Verdon was Treasurer of the new
administration, and intimated his intention of renewing, under
their aegis, the proposals which he had unsuccessfully put forward
when occupying the same position in the Heales Ministry for the
reduction of the export duty on gold and of the import duties on
tea and sugar, and of supplying the deficiency by the imposition of
ad valorem duties on the importation of articles which entered into
competition with the local industries. Though the proposed duties
were only to range from 5 per cent. to a maximum of 10, and were
fathered by a Ministry mainly composed of Free-traders, who
advocated them on revenue grounds, the importing interest at once
took the alarm, and rallied to their support all that class of
unbending economists whose devotion to free trade led them to
regard it as an axiomatic principle admitting of no exceptions on
grounds of fiscal expediency or the exigencies of a new community.
Simultaneously the declared protectionists, who were daily growing
in popularity, declined to accept the ministerial proposals as
anything more than a halting step in the right direction; and when,
at the general election in 1864, the ranks of this party were
greatly reinforced, it is not surprising that the McCulloch
Government should have been strengthened, instead of weakened, in
their determination to carry through their very moderate proposals.
The free trade party were intrenched in the Legislative Council,
where their majority was overwhelming; and availing themselves of
the experience acquired in the previous session, when payment of
members having passed in the Assembly, was ignominiously rejected
in the Council, the Ministry resolved to secure that there should
be no repetition of such tactics in relation to their tariff.
Backed by their large majority in the Assembly, they determined to
tack the tariff to the Appropriation Bill for 1864, and thus to
vindicate once for all, as had been done by the House of Commons in
past times, the supremacy of the Lower House in matters of finance.
The Council accepted the challenge, and threw out the Appropriation
Bill, thus depriving the Government of the means of paying the
civil servants, the works contractors, and other public creditors.
Sir James McCulloch was not, however, a man to be easily beaten,
and he found ready to his hand a legal weapon which for the time
being at least would enable him to frustrate the action of the
Council. Whilst with one hand the Government collected the new
duties on the authority of the Assembly alone, they took advantage
of a clause in the Audit Act which directed the Governor to sign
the necessary warrants for the payment of any sums awarded by
verdicts of the Supreme Court to persons who had sued the
Government. The Government, to start with, borrowed £40,000 of the
London Chartered Bank to meet pressing payments, and the Bank, at
their instigation, sued them for the amount owing. The Government
law officers let judgment go by default, the Governor signed the
needful warrant, and on it the Treasury paid the amount of the
payment to the Bank, who re-loaned it to the Government. And so the
process was repeated and the deadlock avoided. It having been
complained that the Council had not had an opportunity of passing
the Tariff Bill without the indignity of the tack, the Government
in 1865 passed the bill through the Assembly in a separate form,
but in the meantime withheld the Appropriation Bill. This the
Council regarded as adding insult to injury, and promptly rejected
the Tariff Bill. The Government on this decided to appeal to the
country, and came back strongly reinforced; their followers, when
the House met in Feb. 1856, numbering fifty-eight out of a total of
seventy-eight members. The Tariff Bill was again sent up to the
Council; and a despatch, censuring the conduct of the Government in
collecting the new duties on the vote of one house alone, having in
the meantime been received from Mr. Cardwell, the then Colonial
Secretary, they were emboldened to again throw it out. Sir James
McCulloch thereupon resigned; but the Governor found it impossible
to get other advisers, and Sir James resumed office. He now
suspended his financial arrangements with the London Chartered
Bank, and left to the Council the full responsibility of the
suspension of public payments. Calmer counsels now prevailed, and a
conference was held between two Houses, when some slight
alterations in the Tariff Bill were assented to, and the Council
passed the Bill, thus putting an end to the long struggle?only,
however, for it to burst out in a new and envenomed form. Just at
the moment when peace was restored, Sir Charles Darling was
recalled by the Home Government on the ground that he had displayed
partisanship in assisting the McCulloch Government and the majority
in the Assembly to coerce the Upper House. In order to mark the
national gratitude to the outgoing Governor thus censured in the
popular cause, the Assembly decided to offer a grant of £20,000 to
Lady Darling; but, owing to the fact that the Colonial Secretary
intimated that Sir Charles Darling must retire from the colonial
service if the gift were accepted by his wife, and the necessity of
communicating with Sir Charles Darling before deciding on the
action to be taken in consequence, the amount was not actually
voted till August 1867, when it was included in the annual
Appropriation Bill, which was at once rejected by the Council. The
deadlock now recurred with all its former intensity. The new
Governor, Sir John Henry Manners-Sutton (afterwards Viscount
Canterbury) less complaisant than his predecessor, refused to
endorse the judgments of the Supreme Court in favour of the
Government creditors, and the former ingenious sources of
satisfaction were thus shut off, leaving the McCulloch Ministry no
other resource but to resign. The new Governor found it as
impossible as his predecessor had done to form an alternative
Government, Mr. Fellows, to whom he primarily applied, declining to
guide his course in relation to the Darling grant by the results of
another appeal to the country. Sir James McCulloch resumed office,
and obtained the passage of a temporary supply bill, on a pledge
that no part of the money voted should be applied to the payment of
the obnoxious grant. After a brief recess Parliament was again
called together; the Governor, to put an end to the trouble,
agreeing, now that Sir Charles Darling had resigned the public
service, to recommend the Council to pass the Appropriation Bill
with the £20,000 grant included. The Council, however, formally
repudiated his intervention, but agreed to consider the grant on
its merits if it were sent up to them as a separate measure. The
Government was inclined to agree to this course, but the Assembly
insisted on its continued inclusion in the Appropriation Bill, or
otherwise they would be committed to the admission that tacking was
unconstitutional, and would thus abrogate the privileges which they
had fought so hard to vindicate. The result was that the Council
again summarily rejected the Appropriation Bill. Another temporary
supply bill was introduced; but the Council rejected it, on the
ground that there was no guarantee that it might not be utilised to
pay the Darling grant. In this dilemma the Ministry had recourse to
their old device for meeting public payments in a modified form.
They decided not to have recourse to a bank, but notified the
public creditors that if they brought actions individually against
the Crown they would not be defended. Even the Governor was
impressed with the necessities of the situation, and agreed to this
course being adopted, so long as the procedure was confined to the
payment of services necessary for the protection of life and
property or the prevention of dangerous confusion. In the meantime
Parliament was again dissolved, with the result that the Government
supporters counted sixty as against eighteen for the Opposition. In
the meantime the Duke of Buckingham had become Colonial Secretary,
and a despatch was received from him forbidding the Governor to in
any way facilitate the adoption of the Darling grant. This was
tantamount to prohibiting its inclusion in the Appropriation Bill.
Sir James McCulloch and his colleagues immediately resigned, and
after prolonged negotiations Sir Charles Sladen agreed to form, in
the teeth of hostile votes in the Assembly, a ministry which only
lasted two months. In the meantime the deadlock seemed likely to
become more stringent than ever, it being now the turn of the
Assembly to block Governmental supplies. Just at the most critical
juncture the Colonial Office made its peace with Sir Charles
Darling, who withdrew his resignation from the service, and at the
same time terminated the dilemma by intimating the inability of
himself or his wife to accept anything in the shape of a donation
from the people of Victoria. Two years later, when Sir James
McCulloch was once more Premier, a measure passed both Houses,
which secured a life annuity of £1000 a year to Lady Darling, whose
husband had in the meantime died in England. Sir James McCulloch
resumed office as Premier, Treasurer, and Chief Secretary, with a
slightly altered following, in July 1868, on the retirement of the
Sladen Government, who still remained in a hopeless minority in the
Assembly. The second McCulloch Ministry resigned in September of
the following year, Sir James becoming Premier for the third time
in April 1870, when he again took the portfolio of Treasurer and
Chief Secretary. Additional taxation being necessary, Mr. McCulloch
was urged by his protectionist supporters to increase the import
duties; but this he refused to do, proposing to provide for the
deficit by levying a tax on town, suburban and country property.
This scheme proving unacceptable, he resigned, and was succeeded by
Mr. (now Sir) Charles Gavan Duffy, in June 1871. In the meantime
Sir James had been knighted in celebration of the visit of the Duke
of Edinburgh, who arrived in Victoria during his second
premiership, For a considerable period during the years 1872 and
1873 he acted as Agent-General in London for Victoria, and in 1874
was created K.C.M.G. Returning to the colony he became Premier,
Chief Secretary, and Treasurer for the fourth and last time on Oct.
20th, 1875, and held office till May 1877, when, his party
sustaining a crushing defeat at the general election, he made way
for Mr. (now Sir Graham) Berry, who, on the ground that the
majority supporting the last McCulloch Government in the Assembly
only represented the minority in the country, persistently
obstructed the business of the Lower House during the latter
portion of Sir James' tenure of office, with the view of forcing on
a dissolution. This course of conduct led to the introduction of
the closure, or "iron hand," as it was locally called, with a view
to frustrating the obstructionist, or, as they were styled, the
"stonewalling" tactics of the Opposition under Mr. Berry, Sir James
McCulloch was himself re-elected for Warrnambool in 1877; but
finding his party reduced to an inconsiderable fraction in the
Assembly, he shortly afterwards retired from Parliament, and has
since, with a short interval, resided in England, where he is now
permanently settled. Sir James was twice President of the Melbourne
Chamber of Commerce, and has been chairman of several banks and
numerous important public companies. He takes a warm interest in
the National Gallery of Victoria, of which he was a trustee for
many years, and has assisted in the selection of numerous paintings
purchased for it in England. He married, first, in 1841, Susan,
daughter of the late Rev. James Renwick, of Muirton, Scotland; and,
secondly, in 1867, Margaret, daughter of William Inglis, of
Walflat, Dumbartonshire.</p>

Alfred</b>, ex-judge of the Southern District Courts, New South
Wales, was born on April 24th, 1824, in county Londonderry, in
Ireland. His father was a member of one of the earliest firms of
linen-bleachers in that part of the North. He himself was educated
at Foyle College and Belfast College, and became a student of law
at King's Inn, Dublin, in 1843. In 1845 he studied temporarily at
Lincoln's Inn, London, and was called to the Irish Bar in Easter
term, 1847. He then joined the North-east Circuit, and practised in
the superior courts at Dublin. Meantime he published a book upon
"Principles and Practice of Pleading in Equity," which in 1857
procured his first judicial appointment as judge of the principal
civil and criminal courts of Western Australia, a post which he
filled till March 1861, when he resigned and went to New South
Wales, where on May 30th he was appointed an acting district court
judge. He was made Chief Commissioner of Insolvent Estates in July
of the same year, and in 1865 became one of the Metropolitan
District Court judges and Chairman of Quarter Sessions, a position
which he exchanged in Nov. 1868 for his late office of sole judge
of the Southern District Courts and Courts of Quarter Sessions. He
retired in 1892. In the meantime he did much good work in
consolidating the Insolvency, District Court, and Mining Statutes.
He was also the author of a successful little work descriptive of
the climate, soil, early history, products, capabilities, sports,
and pastimes of the districts of Illawarra and Manaro, in New South
Wales.</p>

<p><a name="A877" id="A877"></a><b>MacFarland, John Henry</b>,
M.A., Master of Ormond College, Melbourne University, was born at
Omagh co. Tyrone, on April 19th, 1851, and educated at the Royal
Academical Institution, Belfast, graduating as senior scholar in
Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in the Queen's University in
Ireland, and then proceeding to St. John's College, Cambridge,
where he was elected a foundation scholar. Having graduated as a
wrangler in 1876, he was appointed an assistant-master at Repton
School, a post which he held until he was elected to the position
he now occupies of Master of Ormond College, Melbourne
University.</p>

<p><a name="A878" id="A878"></a><b>McGowan, Samuel Walker</b>,
formerly Deputy Postmaster-General, Victoria, was the son of Samuel
M?Gowan of Kingston, Ontario, Canada who had emigrated from the
north of Ireland, and was born on Jan. 4th, 1829. He was originally
intended for the profession of the law, but ultimately studied
Telegraphy under the renowned Professor Morse. After being in the
service of more than one telegraphic company in Canada and the
States, Mr. M?Gowan in 1853 arrived in Melbourne with the ambitious
project of establishing working lines of telegraph to Sydney and
Adelaide, as well as to the local centres of population in
Victoria. Mr. M?Gowan brought with him an expert working
telegraphist, as well as a supply of instruments, batteries, etc.
After much negotiation the enterprising young Canadian scientist
was employed to establish telegraphic communication between
Melbourne and its port, Williamstown. This short line, which was
fully opened to the public in March 1854, was the first south of
the equator, and served to form the basis of the now gigantic
telegraph system of Australia. From 1854, the date of its
formation, to 1869 Mr. M?Gowan held the office of
Superintendent-General of the Electric Telegraph Department of
Victoria, and upon the amalgamation of the Postal and Telegraph
Departments, in the latter year, he was appointed Inspector-General
of the conjoint services. Upon the retirement of Mr. William
Turner, Mr. M?Gowan became Deputy Postmaster-General. He was an
officer of the local Torpedo Corps, and an energetic member of the
Royal Society of Victoria. Mr. M?Gowan married, on June 30th, 1857,
Annie, eldest daughter of the late Major Henry Wm. Benson, CM., of
Kingston, Ontario. He died on April 18th, 1887, shortly after his
return from a visit to Europe and America.</p>

<p><a name="A879" id="A879"></a><b>MacGregor, Duncan</b>, M.A.,
M.B., son of James MacGregor and Isabella his wife, was born at
Fortingall, Perthshire, Scotland, on Dec. 14th, 1843, and married
at York Place, Edinburgh, in Dec. 1870, to Miss Mary Johnston. In
Aug. 1870 he was appointed Professor of Mental Science in the
University of Otago, N.Z., a post which he resigned in 1886. From
1876 to 1882 Dr. MacGregor was medical officer of the Dunedin
Lunatic Asylum, and in April 1886 was appointed Inspector-General
of Asylums and Hospitals in New Zealand, a position he still
holds.</p>

<p><a name="A879a" id="A879a"></a><b>MacGregor, Hon. John</b>,
sometime Minister of Mines, Victoria, was the son of John
Macgregor, and was born in the island of Skye, Scotland, in 1828.
He arrived in Victoria in 1840, was admitted a solicitor of the
Supreme Court in 1855, and practised in Melbourne, in what was
latterly the firm of Macgregor, Ramsay, &amp; Brahe. He
unsuccessfully contested East Bourke in 1868, but on the retirement
of Mr. Wilson Gray in the next year he was returned for Rodney, for
which district he sat in the Legislative Assembly till 1874, when
he retired from Parliament. Mr. Macgregor joined the
first&nbsp;M?Culloch&nbsp;Government, and was Minister of Mines
from July 1866 to May 1868. On the defeat of
the&nbsp;Macpherson&nbsp;Ministry in April 1870 Mr. Macgregor was
asked by the Governor to form a Government, but he recommended that
Sir James M?Culloch should be sent for. Mr. Macgregor brought in,
and for the first time carried, a Payment of Members Bill. He had
long retired from public life when he died on March 27th, 1884.

<p><a name="A880" id="A880"></a><b>MacGregor, Sir William</b>,
K.C.M.G., M.D., administrator of British New Guinea, was born in
1846, and was brought up to the medical profession. He was admitted
L.R.C.P. Edinburgh and M.B. Aberdeen in 1872, and M.D. of the
latter university in 1874. He successively held the appointments of
assistant Government medical officer at the Seychelles,
superintendent of the lunatic asylum and resident surgeon at the
Civil Hospital at Port Louis, Mauritius, assistant surgeon Royal
Lunatic Asylum at Aberdeen, and surgeon and house physician at the
Royal Infirmary, Glasgow. He was chief medical officer of Fiji from
1875 to 1877 and Receiver-General of the colony from 1877 to 1888,
when he was appointed administrator of British New Guinea, in
succession to the late Sir Peter Scratchley. He has received the
Albert (second class) and Clarke medals for saving life at sea. He
represented Fiji at the Federal Council of Australasia in 1886, and
several times administered the government of Fiji, and acted as
High Commissioner and Consul-General of the Western Pacific. Since
his appointment as administrator of British New Guinea he has done
some of the most remarkable exploration work yet achieved. He was
created C.MG. in 1881 and K.C.M.G. in 1889.</p>

<p><a name="A881" id="A881"></a><b>McIlwraith, Hon. Sir Thomas</b>,
K.C.M.G., M.L.A., LL.D., Colonial Treasurer of Queensland, is the
son of the late John McIlwraith, of Ayr, Scotland, and was born
there in 1835. He was educated in his native town and at Glasgow
University. Having studied engineering, he emigrated to Victoria
(whither his elder brother had preceded him) in 1854, and was
employed as a civil engineer on the Victorian railways, and also in
the same capacity by Messrs. Cornish &amp; Bruce, the well-known
railway contractors, whose cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre against the
Victorian Government he was mainly instrumental in bringing to a
successful issue. In 1861 Mr. McIlwraith became largely engaged in
squatting pursuits in Queensland, and in 1870 finally settled in
that colony, where the year before he had been returned to the
Legislative Assembly for Maranoa. He was Minister for Public Works
and Mines in the late Mr. Macalister's Government from Jan. to Oct.
1874, when he resigned. In 1878 he was elected for Mulgrave; and on
the defeat of the Douglas Ministry in Jan. 1879 became Premier of
the Colony, with the appointment of Colonial Treasurer. Two years
later he exchanged this post for that of Colonial Secretary, and
remained Premier until Nov. 1883, when he resigned with his
colleagues, the general election having resulted in a majority for
his successor, Mr. (now Sir) Samuel Griffith, who carried two
adverse votes against him. The defeat of Sir Thomas, who was
created K.C.M.G. in 1882, was mainly brought about by his proposal
to construct the Queensland portion of the Trans-Continental
Railway on the Land Grant System under a concession to an English
company. Perhaps the most important event of his administration was
the annexation of New Guinea, which was carried out under his
instruction on April 4th, 1883. This act evoked the unanimous
approval of the Australasian colonies, but, much to the general
indignation, was disallowed by Lord Derby, then Secretary of State
for the Colonies. The way was thus thrown open for the German
Government to interpose; the statesmanlike action of Sir Thomas
McIlwraith and the protests of the colonists against its
disallowance being amply justified by the foothold which Germany
was enabled to gain, not only in New Guinea, but throughout the
Western Pacific. Out of these events sprang the Intercolonial
Convention, held in Sydney in Nov. 1883, which formulated the basis
upon which the Federal Council of Australasia was ultimately
established. Sir Thomas McIlwraith had gone out of power before the
Convention met, and it was attended by his successor; but he is
understood to have warmly sympathised with this, as with all other
attempts to advance the cause of Australasian unity. Sir Thomas,
who became an Associate of the Institute of Civil Engineers in
1881, and had the honorary degree of LL.D. conferred upon him by
Glasgow University, visited England in 1883, when he and his elder
brother, Mr. John McIlwraith (formerly Mayor of Melbourne) were
publicly invested with the freedom of their native town. Sir Thomas
retired from public life in 1886, but re-entered it in 1888, when
he headed the poll for North Brisbane by a large majority over the
Premier, Sir Samuel Griffith. His programme of a national party
aroused enthusiasm, the elections throughout the country turned in
his favour, and he resumed office as Premier, Chief Secretary, and
Colonial Treasurer in June. One of the principal events of his
short tenure of office was his contest with the then Governor, Sir
Anthony Musgrave, over the exercise of the prerogative of mercy in
the case of convicted criminals, Sir Thomas contending that the
Governor had no choice but to follow the advice of his ministers in
these matters, whilst the latter claimed to exercise an independent
discretion. The point was subsequently decided by the Colonial
Office in Sir Thomas McIlwraith's favour. On the death of Sir
Anthony Musgrave, in Oct. 1888, Sir Thomas claimed that his
Government should be consulted by the Imperial authorities prior to
the appointment of his successor. This was refused as a matter of
principle by Lord Knutsford, who immediately announced the
appointment of Sir Henry Blake to the Governorship of Queensland.
Sir Thomas McIlwraith formally protested against the nomination,
and a deadlock ensued, which was only obviated by the voluntary
retirement of Sir Henry Blake from a difficult and delicate
position. At the end of November Sir Thomas McIlwraith resigned the
Premiership to Mr. Morehead, but still retained a seat in the
Ministry without portfolio. On his return from a visit to China and
Japan, undertaken with a view of recruiting his health, causes of
difference arose, and he finally retired from association with his
former colleagues in Sept. 1889. In the following year he joined
with his former rival, Sir Samuel Griffith, in defeating their
financial proposals; and, on their retirement in August 1890.
accepted office as Treasurer in the Administration which Sir Samuel
Griffith was then called upon to form. Sir Thomas, who is a Hon.
Lieut.-Colonel in the Queensland Scottish Volunteer Rifles, married
in 1879 Harriette Ann, daughter of Hugh Mosman of Armidale, N.S.W.
In 1890 Sir Thomas, who was expected to visit the United Kingdom,
was invited to contest the Ayr Boroughs in the Liberal interest at
the next general election. He, however, declined the candidature.
Sir Thomas McIlwraith was one of the Queensland delegates at the
Federation Convention held in Sydney in March 1891. In the latter
year, owing to some observations made by Sir Thomas McIlwraith in
the Queensland Assembly in relation to the failure of the
Queensland loan, the Bank of England terminated their business
relations with the colony, but the difficulty has since been
satisfactorily adjusted by mutual explanations. Some years ago Sir
Thomas became involved in intricate litigation with the Queensland
Investment and Land Mortgage Company, in which Sir Arthur Palmer
and Messrs. Hart and Drury were his co-defendants. Damages were
claimed in a series of actions for negligence on the part of the
latter as local directors of the plaintiff company in making
advances to certain persons on securities which proved to be
insufficient. After protracted proceedings, the first of the
actions terminated in a verdict for the defendants. Mr. Andrew
McIlwraith, Sir Thomas McIlwraith's younger brother, is head of the
firm of McIlwraith, McEacharn &amp; Co., the well-known
Anglo-Australian shipping and mercantile firm. It may be added that
Sir Thomas McIlwraith took an active interest in the experimental
voyage of the Strathleven early in the year 1880, when, it will be
remembered, his brother's firm, above alluded to, sent out this
steamer to Australia for the purpose of testing the possibility of
bringing meat in a fresh condition to the English market. The
experiment, being eminently satisfactory, was the means of
conferring an enormous boon on the pastoral industries of Australia
and New Zealand. [Supplement: In the action mentioned above, the
Chief Justice overruled the findings of the jury, and entered a
verdict for plaintiffs, against which defendants have
appealed.]</p>

<p><a name="A882" id="A882"></a><b>Mackay, Hon. Angus</b>, son of
Murdoch Mackay, of 78th Highlanders, and Elizabeth (Macleod) his
wife, was born at Aberdeen on Jan. 26th, 1824, and was taken to
Sydney, N.S.W., by his parents when only three years old. He was
educated at the Australian College, and was intended for the
Presbyterian ministry, but became a schoolmaster, and meanwhile
contributed to the Australian Magazine and also to the Atlas, a
Sydney paper, established by Mr. Robert Lowe (now Viscount
Sherbrooke). In 1847 he became editor of the Atlas, but resigned in
1850 to become manager of a business for Mr. (now Sir Henry) Parkes
at Geelong, Victoria. Returning to Sydney, he was attached to the
People's Advocate, but again took up his residence in Victoria in
1853, and in the following year joined in purchasing the Bendigo
Advertiser, subsequently assisting his co-partners in starting the
M?Ivor Times and the Riverine Herald. In Feb. 1868 Mr. Mackay was
returned to the Victorian Parliament for Sandhurst, and was
re-elected in March 1871 and again in April 1874. At the general
election in May 1877 Mr. Mackay suffered defeat owing to his
adherence to Sir James M?Culloch; but Mr. Blackham, who displaced
him, being unseated on petition, he was once more returned for
Sandhurst in July of the same year. Having again gone to reside in
Sydney, he did not offer himself as a candidate in 1880, but was
elected in 1883 and again rejected in 1886. In July 1879 Mr. Mackay
started the Sydney Daily Telegraph newspaper on behalf of a company
of which he was manager till Feb. 1883, when he was re-elected for
Sandhurst. Mr. Mackay was Minister of Mines in the M?Culloch
Government from April 1870 to June 1871, and in the Francis
Administration from June 1872 to July 1874, acting also as Minister
of Public Instruction from May to July 1874. In the Kerferd
Government Mr. Mackay continued to be Minister of Mines and
Education from July 1874 to August 1875. He died on July 7th,
1886.</p>

<p><a name="A883" id="A883"></a><b>McKean, Hon. James</b>, son of
Rev. David M?Kean, a Presbyterian minister, was born at Belfast,
Ireland, on April 24th, 1832. He emigrated to Victoria about 1854,
and experienced a variety of the ups and downs of colonial life. In
1863 he was admitted a solicitor of the supreme court of the
colony, and still practises in Melbourne. He was member for
Maryborough for a number of years, and was Minister of Lands in the
Macpherson Ministry from Sept. 1869 to April 1870. During the
prevalence of the "Stonewall" agitation, in 1876, Mr. M?Kean was
committed to the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms for disorderly
conduct in defying the closure rule, and was ultimately expelled
the House for some uncomplimentary references to his fellow-members
of the Assembly, made whilst conducting a police court case. Mr.
M?Kean was subsequently elected for North Gippsland, but was
defeated at the general election in 1883, and has not since
re-entered parliament, though he contested Collingwood in June
1892.</p>

Kinnaird</b>, M.L.C., M.B., C.M., son of Frederick MacKellar, M.D.,
of Sydney, N.S.W., and Elizabeth Beaton (Robertson) his wife, was
born in Sydney in Dec. 1844. He married in 1877 Marion, second
daughter of Thomas Buckland, of Sydney. Dr. MacKellar was admitted
M.B. and C.M. of Glasgow University in 1871, and practises his
profession in Sydney, N.S.W., where he is a member of the Board of
Health. Dr. MacKellar was nominated to the Legislative Council in
Aug. 1885, and represented the Jennings Government in the Upper
House as Minister of Mines from Dec. 1886 to Jan. 1887.</p>

<p><a name="A885" id="A885"></a><b>Mackelvie, James Tannock</b>,
has established a perpetual memorial for himself in Auckland, N.Z.,
by his endowment of that city with a valuable art collection
selected by himself in Europe, and a rich bequest for the
maintenance of a permanent gallery. To further this purpose the
Municipal Corporation, in Sept. 1891, resolved to erect a Mackelvie
annexe to the handsome building, in which the Grey Literary
Collection and the Auckland Free Public Library are placed. Mr.
Mackelvie in early life was engaged as supercargo of a vessel
during the Crimean war, and subsequently as purser on an Atlantic
liner. Leaving the sea, he obtained an appointment in a large
mercantile house in London, and was so engaged in 1865, when Dr.
Campbell, desiring a partner to take charge of his business while
he visited Europe, entered into an agreement with Mr. Mackelvie,
who came to Auckland and assumed the direction of the business of
Messrs. Brown, Campbell &amp; Co. until 1870, when the partnership
terminated by effluxion of time. During that short period, however,
Mr. Mackelvie had amassed a fortune by means of judicious mining
investments on the Thames goldfields. He returned to Europe a month
or two after quitting his connection with Brown, Campbell &amp;
Co., and lived in retirement, employing a large part of his time in
collecting the art treasures which he had resolved to bequeath to
the city where his fortune was made. Many valuable paintings and
sketches were forwarded to Auckland during his lifetime, and at his
death, which took place on June 4th, 1885, by the terms of his
will, after providing for about £35,000 legacies, in some of which
the trustees have a reversionary interest, the balance of the
estate was left in trust for the people of Auckland. The legacy,
owing to the great depreciation in all kinds of property, is very
much less than the testator no doubt intended, but, including the
reversionary interest in legacies, the trustees hope the amount may
not be far short of £30,000, besides the valuable collection now in
the Art Gallery. During his stay in the colony Mr. Mackelvie was
director of the Bank of New Zealand, the New Zealand Loan and
Mercantile Company, and other companies.</p>

Berkshire. He was born in 1849, and was formerly a lieutenant in
the Royal Navy. Having taken service in the New South Wales
military forces, be acted as Brigade-Major to the Soudan expedition
in 1885, was mentioned in despatches, and received a medal with
clasp, and also the Khedive's star. In Oct. 1888 he was appointed
Assistant Adjutant-General to the New South Wales forces, and ranks
as lieut.-colonel. He married, in 1873, Sofala, daughter of the
late Hon. John Bligh Suttor, M.L.C., of Wyngdon, Bathurst,

Minister of Lands and Immigration, New Zealand, was born at
Ardross, in Ross-shire, Scotland, in 1838. In 1860 he went to
Otago, N.Z., and soon acquired sufficient experience to become
working manager of the Pakitapu station, near Palmerston. He then
took to farming on his own account in the Shag Valley. In 1865 he
was made clerk and treasurer to the local Road Board and secretary
to the local School Committee. In 1868 he contested Waikouaiti for
a seat in the Provincial Council of Otago, Mr. George M?Lean being
his opponent, but he lost the election. In 1871, however, he was
successful, beating his opponent, Mr. John Douglas, for the Waihemo
seat by two to one. He retained this position until the abolition
of provinces, having been elected a second time for Waihemo without
opposition. In 1881 he was sent to the House of Representatives by
the electors of Moeraki, and has sat in the House for various
constituencies for the same part of the country ever since. In 1884
he went to Sydney to attend the Stock Conference. Mr. McKenzie was
whip to the Stout-Vogel combination in 1884, and did good service
for his party, being rewarded by the portfolio of Lands and
Immigration when the Ballance Government came into office in Jan.
1891.</p>

Assembly of Queensland for the Burnett in 1860, and was Colonial
Treasurer in the Administration of Mr. (now Sir) R. G. W. Herbert,
the first formed under responsible government, from Dec. 1859 to
August 1862. In the Macalister Government, which succeeded, he was
Colonial Secretary from Feb. to July 1866, and in August 1867 he
formed a Government of which he was Premier and Colonial Treasurer.
He went out of office in Nov. 1868, succeeded his brother as 10th

Chief Commissioner of Railways, New Zealand, is the son of Andrew
McKerrow and Margaret (Steven) his wife, and was born at
Kilmarnock, Scotland, on July 7th, 1834. Mr. McKerrow emigrated to
Dunedin, N.Z., in Nov. 1859, and was District and Geodetical
Surveyor of Otago from that year till 1873, Chief Surveyor of Otago
from 1873 to 1877, Assistant Surveyor-General of New Zealand from
Jan. 1877 to Oct. 1879, also Secretary of Crown Lands and Mines
from Feb. 1878 to Jan. 1889. From Oct. 1878 he held the latter
office in conjunction with that of Surveyor-General of New Zealand,
being appointed in Jan. 1889 to his present office of Chief
Commissioner of New Zealand Railways. In 1861 to 1863 Mr. McKerrow
made the reconnaissance survey of the Otago Lake districts, an area
of eight thousand square miles. The reports of these surveys were
read before the Royal Geographical Society of London, and received
the special commendation of the President, Sir Roderick Murchison,
in his annual address. In 1874 and 1882 Mr. McKerrow was associated
with the British expeditions for the observation of the transit of
Venus in New Zealand. In 1884 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal
Astronomical Society of London. He was married on August 5th, 1859,
at Fenwick, Ayrshire, Scotland, to Miss Martha Dunlop.</p>

<p><a name="A890" id="A890"></a><b>McKinlay, John</b>, the famous
explorer, was born at Sandbank, on the Clyde, in 1819, and in 1836
emigrated to New South Wales, to join his uncle, a prosperous
squatter in that colony. He quickly became an expert bushman, and
took up several runs near the South Australian border, thus
becoming especially identified with that colony, the Government of
which, in 1861, appointed him leader of an expedition organised to
search for traces of Burke and Wills. He was also instructed to
acquire a knowledge of the country between Eyre's Creek and Central
Mount Stuart, and to visit the western shores of Lake Eyre.
Starting in August, Mr. McKinlay penetrated to Cooper's Creek, and
was shown by the natives the remains of Gray, the first victim of
the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition. Sending back the news to
Adelaide, he subsequently learnt that Mr. Howitt had already
ascertained the fate of the party and found the bodies of Burke and
Wills. He then determined to push on to the northern coast, and
reached the Gulf of Carpentaria, after great hardships, in May
1862; but not finding, as he had expected, a vessel laden with
provisions to replenish his supplies, he had to retrace his steps
and endeavour to reach the settled districts of Queensland. Reduced
to scant rations of horse and camel's flesh, the party ultimately
reached an out-station in the valley of the Burdekin River, seventy
miles from Port Denison, which place they ultimately reached
without much difficulty, and thence made their way to Melbourne,
where an ovation awaited them on their arrival, on Sept. 25th,
1862. The Royal Geographical Society of England presented McKinlay
with a gold watch, the South Australian Parliament voted him £1000,
and the public of the colony subscribed for an elaborate tea and
coffee service. In Sept. 1865 the South Australian Government
despatched McKinlay to explore the Northern Territory. It turned
out one of the rainiest seasons ever known; and, being environed by
water, but for Mr. McKinlay's ingenuity in killing the remaining
horses and constructing a raft out of their skins, stretched on a
framework of saplings, the whole party must have perished. As it
was, they managed to drift down the Alligator River to the open
sea, at Adam's Bay, where they were safe. On his return from this
journey, Mr. McKinlay reverted to his former pastoral occupations,
but died of ailments brought on by hardships and exposure, on Dec.
31st, 1872. A monument was erected to his memory by the residents
of Gawler, S.A. Mr. John Davis, who formed one of the party on his
great expedition, commemorated its incidents in an interesting work
entitled "Tracks of McKinlay across Australia."</p>

<p><a name="A891" id="A891"></a><b>Mackinnon, Lauchlan</b>, one of
the most enterprising of the pioneer colonists of Victoria and one
of the proprietors of the Melbourne Argus from 1852, until his
decease on March 21st, 1888, was born at Kilbride, Isle of Skye,
Scotland, on Feb. 26th, 1817. He was the second son of the late
Rev. John Mackinnon, Presbyterian minister of Strath, Skye, by his
marriage with Ann, daughter of Lauchlan Mackinnon, of Curry, Skye,
After being educated partly at home and subsequently at Broadford,
Mr. Mackinnon entered the office of his uncle Mr. Lauchlan
Mackinnon, a Writer to the Signet in Glasgow; but preferring a more
active life, he in 1838 proceeded to Sydney. He at once engaged in
the hazardous business of "overlanding," and succeeded in his
dangerous mission of conveying stock from Sydney to Adelaide?a feat
which attracted much attention at the time, as it was the first
overland journey made between these distant points. A little later
(in 1840) he made one of the earliest overland journeys with sheep
from Sydney to Melbourne. The pastoral capabilities of the country
attracted his attention, and he determined to settle in Australia
Felix. He took up a run in the western district on the Loddon
River, and subsequently removed to Mount Fyans. He was for some
years associated in business with the late Mr. James Montgomery,
and in 1852 he joined Mr. Edward Wilson, and became one of the
proprietors of the Argus. Prior to this he had taken a prominent
part in political life, particularly interesting himself in the
agitation for the separation of Port Phillip from New South Wales.
He was one of the representatives for the district of Port Phillip
in the Sydney Parliament in 1848, and vigorously supported its
claims for justice from the governing authorities of New South
Wales. He was a strong and earnest supporter of the anti-convict
movement, and took a prominent part in the demonstration which was
held in Melbourne in 1849, when the inhabitants resolved to oppose
the landing of convicts from the ship Randolph by physical force,
and to undergo any extremity of suffering rather than permit the
colony to become a receptacle of felons. After separation had been
secured, Mr. Mackinnon represented the Belfast and Warrnambool
district in the Legislative Council of Victoria, and assisted to
pass a measure intended to prevent the introduction of convicted
offenders into the colony. He energetically combated the efforts of
the imperial authorities to prevent the effective administration of
the enactment; and on the popular opposition proving successful he
proceeded in 1853 with Mr. Westgarth to Tasmania to assist the
anti-transportation party in the colony. Indeed, he took a strong
interest in all the public movements of the day; and his vigour and
courage were so well recognised that, in the early days when
bushrangers were prevalent, he had been offered the command of the
police force of Port Phillip?a position which, however, he did not
accept. He was one of the members of the original Council of the
University of Melbourne, and first Chairman of its Building
Committee. When the gold discoveries in Victoria gave such a
wonderful impetus to the colony, the vigorous judgment and business
ability of Mr. Mackinnon, with the brilliant literary qualities of
his partner, Mr. Willson, placed the Argus in the van of the
Australian press. After some years of arduous work, Mr. Mackinnon
returned to England, where he remained. He was twice married, his
first wife being a daughter of the late Robert Montgomery, and
sister of the late Mr. James Montgomery; and his second, Emily,
daughter of Capt. Bundoch, R.N.</p>

senior partner in the firm of A. M?Lean &amp; Co., stock and
station agents in Melbourne and Gippsland. Up to 1880 he resided in
Gippsland, and in that year was returned to the Assembly for the
electorate of North Gippsland, and still sits for the reconstructed
constituency. Whilst President of the Maffra Shire Council he took
a leading part in establishing the Municipal Association of
Victoria. In Nov. 1890 Mr. M?Lean accepted the post of Minister of
Lands in Mr. Munro's Government, and was sworn of the Executive
Council. On the death of Mr. Langridge he took the additional
office of Chief Secretary, and when the Ministry was reconstituted
under Mr. Shiels he retained both posts.</p>

K.C.M.G., fourth son of the late John McLean, of Kilmonaig, Tiree,
Argyllshire, and Margaret, daughter of the Rev. D. McColl, was born
on Oct. 27th, 1820. At the age of seventeen he emigrated to Sydney,
and entered the office of a merchant there. Going to New Zealand,
two years later, he was appointed clerk and interpreter in the
office of the Chief Protector of the Aborigines, and soon gained a
thorough acquaintance with Maori affairs. He became Protector of
the Aborigines in Taranaki, and as such came into relation with the
chief Te Heu Heu; in 1850 he was made resident magistrate for a
native district. In 1847 he was instructed by the Governor (Sir
George Grey) to secure the land at Waitara, which Commissioner
Spain had decided was the property of the Government (an account of
which will be found in the biography of Sir George Grey). After a
varied experience as Chief Commissioner of Land Purchases, Mr.
M?Lean was made Native Secretary in 1856, as a permanent officer
under the control of the Governor. This dual arrangement, by which
there was a Native Secretary outside the responsible ministry, led
to much confusion, but Mr. M?Lean agreed that the Governor should
retain the control of native affairs. In 1866 he was charged by Mr.
Weld, then premier, with the task of reducing to order the hostile
natives on the east coast. On June 28th, 1869, the Stafford
Government went out of office, and Mr. Fox formed a ministry in
which Mr. M?Lean was Native Minister and Minister for Colonial
Defence. He held these positions till Sept. 10th, 1872, when the
Government was defeated. Shortly after entering upon office he
succeeded in making peace in the Waikato with the king party. At
this time the colony was troubled by the outlaw Te Kooti, and Mr.
M?Lean hit upon the idea of handing the chase over to the friendly
Maoris, under Major Ropata; and subsequently adhered to a stedfast
policy of peace, arranging for the return of Te Rangitake, one of
the figures in the Waitara trouble, to Taranaki. So successful was
he, and so trusted by the Maoris, that, upon the resignation of the
Fox Ministry, in 1872, Mr. Stafford, in forming a Cabinet, offered
to take over Mr. M?Lean as Native Minister. The Stafford Government
had but a brief life, and on Oct. 11th, 1872, Mr. M?Lean became
again Native Minister under Mr. Waterhouse. While in power he
carried through the House a valuable Land Bill, which gave
satisfaction to Maoris and colonists alike; and also a Native
Reserves Bill. Mr. M?Lean continued in office through successive
reconstructions of the Ministry from Oct. 1872 to Dec. 1876, when
he resigned from ill-health. He died in Jan. 1877, and after his
death his honourable policy was continued. He was the first
Superintendent of the Province of Hawkes Bay, and was created
K.C.M.G. in 1874.</p>

Melbourne, Vict., in 1851, where he was connected with the Oriental
Bank Corporation, he went to Otago, N.Z., in 1862, as manager of
the Dunedin branch of the Bank of New Zealand, and was Provincial
Treasurer in 1869. Mr. M?Lean, who went largely into commercial
pursuits, represented Waikonaiti in the New Zealand House of
Representatives for a period of ten years, and was nominated to the
Legislative Council in 1881. He was a member of the Vogel Ministry
from July to Sept. 1876, as Commissioner of Customs; and when the
Ministry was reconstructed, after the departure of Sir Julius Vogel
to England, under Major Atkinson, Mr. M?Lean was Postmaster-General
from Sept. 1876 to Oct. 1877. Mr. M?Lean who was married at
Dunedin, N.Z., on March 10th, 1867, to Miss Isabel Holmes, was
Commissioner of Trade and Customs in the short-lived Atkinson
Government in 1884. He is chairman of the Colonial Bank of New
Zealand and of the Union Steam Shipping Company of New Zealand,
Limited, and took a prominent part in the settlement of the great
maritime strike of 1890.</p>

at Aird in 1821. He emigrated to New South Wales in 1837, and
ultimately went largely into squatting pursuits, being at one time
interested in no less than forty stations. Latterly he resided on
his property at Westbrook, Darling Downs, Qd. Having entered the
parliament of that colony, he became Colonial Treasurer in the
second Ministry of Mr. (now Sir) R. G. W. Herbert, which was formed
in July 1866 when Mr. Macalister retired, owing to the refusal of
the Governor's assent to his Legal Tender Notes Bill. Mr. Maclean
took office in the midst of a monetary crisis, but quickly restored
the equilibrium of the finances, when his career was cut short by a
fall from his horse which ended fatally on Dec. 16th, 1866.</p>

when he returned to the old country and engaged in agricultural
pursuits. His health failing, he went to Queensland in 1865, where
he commenced dairying operations. He was returned to the Assembly
in 1876 for the Logan, and was appointed Secretary for Public Lands
and Mines in the Douglas Ministry on Dec. 7th, 1878, just six weeks
before their defeat. After being returned three times for the
Logan, Mr. McLean, who has been a prominent advocate of total
abstinence, was defeated in 1883, and became Inspecting
Commissioner of Crown Lands in Nov. 1883, a post which he held
until his nomination as Under-Secretary of the newly created

New South Wales, where he engaged in squatting on the Murrumbidgee
until 1854, when his parliamentary career commenced. He was elected
to the old Legislative Council for Lachlan and Lower Darling in
1854, and sat in the Assembly for Murrumbidgee from 1856 to 1874,
when he resigned, and conducted an expedition to New Guinea, in his
own barque, The Chevert, in company with Capt. Onslow, starting
from Sydney on May 15th, 1875. He was nominated to the Legislative
Council in Oct. 1877, on his return from this journey. In June 1857
Mr. Macleay married Susan Emmeline, second daughter of Mr.
(afterwards Sir) Edward Deas Thomson. He was knighted in 1889, and
died on Dec. 7th, 1891. Sir William was the holder of the gold
medal struck in 1875 to commemorate distinguished services in
connection with the stamping out of bushranging, having assisted in
repulsing an attack by the notorious Gilbert gang at Plumb's Inn,
near Goulburn, in 1864, and he was also the recipient of a gold
medal from the International Fisheries Exhibition of London for his
book on the fishes of Australia. To the Linnaean Society he a few
years back presented a meeting-house at Elizabeth Bay, adjoining
his residence, where he provided everything necessary for meeting
and for study. He also set apart a sufficient sum of money to endow
four fellowships of £400 each yearly at the Sydney University, so

the Mixed Tribunal of Justice at the Havannah. Ten years later he
retired on a pension, and in 1839 arrived in New South Wales, where
he was appointed a Trustee of the Australian Museum and a member of
the National Board of Education. For a short time also he was a

<p><a name="A901" id="A901"></a><b>McLellan, Hon. William</b>,
M.L.A., was born at Crieff, Perthshire, Scotland, on August 12th,
1831. He was educated at local schools, and was brought up to the
trade of a builder. He left Scotland in June 1850 for Victoria,
then a portion of New South Wales. When gold was discovered by
Hargreaves, he went to Summer Hill and Turon diggings, New South
Wales, and worked with some success. Returning to Victoria in July
1851, on discovery of gold there, he went to Ballarat and Forest
Creek, and was amongst the first pioneers of Bendigo, where he
worked at Golden Gully. After an extensive experience on the
principal diggings, Mr. McLellan settled in Melbourne in 1853. In
1857, the time of the Canton Lead, he proceeded to Ararat, where
fifty thousand miners were collected, and was elected a member of
the Mining Board. In 1859, the amended Constitution Act having made
Ararat an electoral district returning two members, he was returned
to the Assembly by a large majority. Mr. McLellan represented
Ararat till the general election in May 1877, when he was beaten by
Mr. D. Gaunson by five votes. He had in the meantime been a member
of three Ministries, taking office first as successor to Mr. I. G.
Reeves as Commissioner of Public Works and Vice-President of the
Board of Land and Works in Jan. 1870, and retiring with his chief,
Mr. Macpherson, in April of the same year. He was subsequently
Minister of Mines, under Mr. (now Sir) Charles Gavan Duffy from
June 1871 to June 1872 and under Sir James M?Culloch from Oct. 1875
to May 1877. Mr. McLellan remained out of Parliament till 1883,
when he was re-elected for Ararat. He occupied the position of

MacMahon, Bart., sometime Master of the Rolls, Ireland, by his
second wife, Charlotte, daughter of Robert Shaw and sister of Sir
Robert Shaw, 1st Bart., of Busby, co. Dublin, was born at
Fortfield, in the county of Dublin, on July 11th, 1824. He joined
the 71st Highland Light Infantry as ensign after seeing some
service in Canada, and exchanged into the 10th Hussars, retiring
from the army, after being invalided for sunstroke in India, with
the rank of captain. Having decided to emigrate to Victoria, he
arrived in Melbourne in Oct. 1852, and joined the police force in
Jan. 1853, being for some time inspector of police in Melbourne,
where he was appointed Assistant Commissioner of Police under Sir
W. H. F. Mitchell, whom he ultimately succeeded in the
Commissionership. The latter office he resigned in 1858, owing to a
disagreement on a matter of discipline with the then Chief
Secretary, Sir John O'Shanassy. He was elected for West Bourke in
the Legislative Assembly in 1861, and, despite their previous
difference, was a member of Sir John O'Shanassy's third Ministry,
without portfolio, from Nov. 1861 to June 1863. At the next general
election Captain MacMahon was defeated, but was elected for West
Melbourne in January 1866, and continued to represent the
constituency till Jan. 1878, when he temporarily retired, but was
re-elected in 1880, and continued to hold the seat till 1886, when
he finally relinquished public life. In 1868 Captain MacMahon was
invited to form a Ministry consequent on the resignation of the
M?Culloch Government, but declined the hopeless task. He was
elected Speaker of the Assembly in April 1871, and was re-elected
in May 1874. He thus held the office during the troublous Stonewall
period; and having given umbrage to the Liberal party, was rejected
in favour of Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, when the new Parliament met
in May 1877. Sir Charles, who was Speaker again for a few months in
1880, was knighted in 1875, and died in East Melbourne on August
28th, 1891. The deceased gentleman, who was a life captain of the
Dublin Militia and a member of the Executive and Legislative
Councils of Victoria prior to responsible government, married first
Miss Sophia Campbell, and secondly Clara Ann, daughter of J. D.
Webster, of Yea, Vict. At the General Election in 1877 Mr. (now Sir
Graham) Berry made a strong attack, in a speech at Geelong, upon
the conduct of Sir Charles MacMahon in his capacity of Speaker of
the Assembly. Mr. Berry was leader of the "Stonewall" Opposition,
and he said: "We" (the Opposition) "could not have been defeated if
it were not for a corrupt Speaker and a corrupt Chairman of
Committees, backed by a Ministry, and giving decisions contrary to
all Parliamentary law and practice, and contrary to the well-known
facts before them at the time." Sir Charles declared to the
electors of West Melbourne that his first impulse had been to
inflict personal chastisement upon Mr. Berry for the slander, but
that he was dissuaded by the late Mr. Francis. It seemed improper
for him, as the late Speaker of the Assembly, to institute criminal
proceedings against a member of the same body, and when he
announced his determination of suing Mr. Berry for damages, Mr.
(now Chief Justice) Higinbotham demonstrated that it would be
"extremely unfair and improper" to bring the proceedings of the
Legislative Assembly under the purview of the Supreme Court, and to
enable the Supreme Court to decide as to the rules and orders by
which that body was to be guided in its internal movements. Under
these circumstances, Sir Charles felt unable to do more than leave
the matter in the hands of Mr. Higinbotham as amicus curia. Mr.
Berry offered an explanation to the effect that he had not used the
word "corrupt" in its ordinary sense, but that what he had meant to
convey was that undue influence was threatened and used by the
Ministry over the decisions given by Sir Charles, but without
impugning the latter's personal integrity as Speaker. This
explanation was regarded as being an aggravation of the offence,
but Sir Charles MacMahon had to content himself with an emphatic
denial of the aspersion.</p>

<p><a name="A903" id="A903"></a><b>MacMahon, Philip</b>, was born
in Dublin on Dec. 13th, 1857, and passed through a course of
botanical instruction at the Royal Gardens at Kew. Having been for
some time secretary and curator to the Hull Botanic Gardens, he was
appointed leader of a botanical expedition to Central America, and
subsequently proceeded to India, where he studied the local systems
of agriculture, horticulture and forestry. In 1888 he went to
Victoria for the sake of his health; and in April 1889 was
appointed curator of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens.</p>

<p><a name="A904" id="A904"></a><b>McMillan, Angus</b>, the
discoverer of Gippsland, Victoria, was born at Glenbrittle, Skye,
in 1810, and went to Sydney in 1830, residing on various stations
in the interior till May 1839, at which time he was overseer on
Lachlan Macalister's station in the Maneroo district of New South
Wales. He had won the confidence of the blacks in the
neighbourhood, who had traditions of a fine country to the south;
and, with the intention of finding fresh pastoral areas, he started
with one of them from Corrowong on May 28th. In June he was at
Omeo, and subsequently explored the Tambo river, obtaining in
September a view of the plain country further south. On a second
expedition, in Dec. 1839, undertaken for the exploration of the
plain country previously seen, he reached Lake King, which he
mistook for Corner Inlet on the sea coast. He also discovered and
named the Nicholson, Mitchell, Macalister, Thomson, Glengarry,
Tangil, and Avon rivers and Mount Wellington. In the meantime
Strzelecki and James Macarthur and James Riley were making their
venturesome overland journey from Sydney to Westernport in
Victoria. They left Sydney on Jan. 20th, and arrived at Westernport
on May 11th, 1840, calling en route, on March 7th, at McMillan's
camp on the Tambo river, and were supplied with provisions, a camp
kettle, and a guide, who went a day's journey with them over the
tracks into what McMillan, who was absent at the time, had called
Caledonia Australis, but which, at the suggestion of Strzelecki,
was named after Sir George Gipps, the governor of New South Wales.
Mr. McMillan occupied a station on the Avon river, near to
Macalister, in Oct. 1840, and in Feb. 1841 penetrated to Corner
Inlet. Without detracting from the eminent services of Strzelecki,
there can be no doubt that the honour of the first exploration of
Gippsland and the marking of a road to a seaport belongs to
McMillan, who died in May 1865.</p>

formation of the late Ministry by Sir Henry Parkes, in March 1889,
he accepted the post of Colonial Treasurer, and was re-elected
unopposed for East Sydney on taking office. Mr. McMillan, who is a
staunch free trader, resigned his seat in the cabinet in 1890,
owing to some comments made by Sir Henry Parkes on language used by
him in reference to the repression of disorders during the great
strike in the shipping trade. Ultimately, however, explanations
were tendered, and he withdrew his resignation, which, if persisted
in, would have seriously injured the Government. Mr. McMillan was
one of the delegates of New South Wales to the Federation
Conference held in Melbourne in Feb. 1890, and was appointed one of
the representatives of the colony at the Convention held in Sydney
in March 1891. In August 1891 he resigned the office of Treasurer,
with the view of paying more exclusive attention to his private
affairs. Mr. McMillan was appointed President of the New South
Wales Commission for the Chicago Exhibition in Sept. 1891. He is

and Mines on Jan. 21st, 1879, retiring from the Government on March
13th, 1883, six months before its fall. He occupied a congenial
seat as member for the great mining district of Townsville, and on
the formation of Sir Thomas McIlwraith's second Cabinet on Jane
13th, 1888, he rejoined his old chief in his former capacity. On
Nov. 30th of the same year, when Mr. Morehead reconstructed the
cabinet under his own premiership, Mr. Macrossan remained in the
ministry, taking the additional office of Colonial Secretary in
Jan. 1890. In August of that year he retired with his colleagues.
He was a prominent advocate of the subdivision of Queensland, and
the constitution of the northern portion into a separate colony.
Mr. Macrossan was one of the representatives of Queensland at the
session of the Federal Council of Australasia held in Hobart in
Jan. to Feb. 1889. He was one of the delegates to the Federation
Convention in Sydney, and died in that city on March 30th, 1891.
The Queensland Parliament voted £2000 to his widow.</p>

the son of the late John Madden, solicitor, of Cork, Ireland, and
was born there on May 16th, 1844. He went to England in Sept. 1852,
and was at a private school there until 1854, when he proceeded to
a college at Beauchamp, in France, where he remained until Sept.
1856, when, with the rest of his father's family, he went to
Melbourne, Vict., arriving on Jan. 10th, 1857. He matriculated at
the Melbourne University in Oct. 1861, and graduated B.A. in 1864
and LL.B. in 1865, in which year he was gold medallist in law. He
was admitted LL.D. in 1869, being the first member of the
university who passed the course prescribed for that degree. On
Sept 14th, 1865, he was admitted to the Victorian Bar, and has
held, a leading position in his profession ever since. He was an
unsuccessful candidate in 1871 for the district of West Bourke, but
at the ensuing general election in 1874 he was returned at the head
of the poll for the district. In Oct. 1876 he accepted office as
Minister of Justice in the M?Culloch Administration, but on going
back to his constituency he was defeated by Mr. M. L. King. He
continued, however, a member of the Government, and on July 27th,
1876, was elected member for Sandridge (now Port Melbourne), which
he represented till 1883. He resigned office with his colleagues in
May 1877 after the victory of Mr. Berry at the polls. He was again
Minister of Justice under Mr. Service from March to August 1880.
Dr. Madden, who has been Warden of the University of Melbourne, and
is understood to have refused a judgeship on more than one
occasion, has recently taken little active part in politics, but
still holds a leading position in his profession.</p>

Africa. He was for three years Colonial Secretary of Western
Australia, and a member of the Executive and Legislative Councils.
He died at Booterstown, near Dublin, on Feb. 5th, 1886. Dr. Madden

brother of John Madden, was born at Cork in 1848, and went to
Victoria in 1857. He began his career as a midshipman on the
Victorian man of war Victoria, and studied marine surveying. When
the vessel was put out of commission he turned his attention to
land surveying, and entered the Survey Department of the Lands
Office in 1865, becoming District Surveyor at Horsham. He was
returned to the Assembly for the Wimmera in Jan. 1880, and still
represents the constituency. He was Minister of Lands in the
O'Loghlen Government from August 1881 to March 1883, and was sworn

<p><a name="A913" id="A913"></a><b>Mair, Major William Gilbert</b>,
son of Gilbert Mair and Elizabeth (Pinkey) his wife, was born at
the Bay of Islands, N.Z., on Nov. 20th, 1832. He served during the
Maori war, and was in seventeen actions, being under fire on more
than thirty occasions altogether. He was recommended by Colonel
Haultain, Minister of Defence, for the decoration of the New
Zealand Cross, for "personal valour before the enemy," and received
the New Zealand war medal, and was twice mentioned in despatches.
During the parley between General Cameron and the Maori insurgents
at Orakau in 1864, Major Mair acted as interpreter and conveyed the
General's message to Rewi Maniapoto calling upon the enemy to
surrender at discretion, when he was fired upon, and the chiefs
returned the now historical answer "Friend, we shall fight you for
ever and ever!" Major Mair commanded the expedition against the
East Coast rebels, resulting in the capture of Te Teko Pa and the
surrender of the murderers of the Rev. C. S. Volkner and of Captain
James Fulloon, Government agent, who were afterwards tried,
convicted and executed. He also commanded the native contingent all
through the Tauranga campaign in 1866-7, when he performed the act
of personal valour for which he was recommended for the Cross. He
was instrumental in obtaining the submission of the Maori king in
1882, when a hundred and twenty stand of arms were handed over to
him in token of the King's sincerity. Major Mair was officially
thanked by the Colonial Government on this and numerous other
occasions. During the nine years of his occupancy of the Bench of
the Native Lands Court (1882-91) Major Mair investigated some
thousands of titles, and passed through his court over two million
acres of native land, clothing it with an English title. He has
contributed several papers on scientific subjects to the
Transactions of the New Zealand Institute. Major Mair, who holds
his rank in the New Zealand Militia, was Government agent and
resident magistrate at Waikato from 1870 to 1882, and now resides
at Auckland. He married at Alexandra, N.Z., on May 15th, 1872, Miss
Jane Black.</p>

M.I.C.E., was born at Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol, and educated
at the Bishop's College, being articled to a civil engineer in
1841. Having made a special study of railway construction, he
sailed for Sydney in 1850, with machinery to start an engineering
and foundry establishment. This scheme, however, was abandoned, and
he was appointed acting engineer of the Sydney Railway Company, and
in 1851 accepted employment under the City Commissioners, which he
resigned in 1856. Two years later he removed to Melbourne, and
assisted in the construction of the Melbourne and Sandhurst Railway
until 1862, when he became manager of the Melbourne and Suburban
Railway. In March 1867 Mr. Mais accepted the position of
Engineer-in-Chief of South Australia, and in Jan. 1871 he was
appointed, in addition, General Manager of Railways. In 1876, when
the work of the position was redistributed, he retained the post of
Engineer-in-Chief and Engineer of Railways and Harbours and
Jetties. Mr. Mais resigned in April 1888, and is now in practice in
Melbourne as a consulting engineer.</p>

<p><a name="A915" id="A915"></a><b>Maniapoto, Rewi</b>, latterly
known as Manga, a chief of the Ngatimaniapoto tribe, acquired a
high reputation as a fighting general during the Waikato campaign
in 1863. He was nominally the Maori leader during the attack upon
and investment of the Orakau Pa by the British forces under Sir
Duncan Cameron, but the gallant escape of the beleaguered garrison
was planned and carried into execution by the young chief Hitiri
Paerata. Rewi was, however, a prominent figure during the whole of
the troublous times, and his influence with a large section of the
insurgent tribes was paramount. At the conclusion of the war the
Government marked their sense of this chief's adherence to the
rules of civilised warfare by giving him a section of land in the
Kihikihi township and building upon it, at the public cost, a
comfortable residence. Most of the lands of his tribe were included
within the confiscated boundary, but some provision was made for
them by the powerful Waikato tribe.</p>

<p><a name="A916" id="A916"></a><b>Maning, Frederick Edward</b>,
late Native Lands Court Judge, New Zealand, was the eldest son of
Frederick Maning, of Johnville, co. Dublin, Ireland, at which place
he was born on July 5th, 1812. His father, attracted by the free
grants of land to settlers in Van Diemen's Land, emigrated with his
family to that colony, arriving at Hobart in the ship Ardent on May
24th, 1824. His son, being of an adventurous spirit, went to New
Zealand in 1833, when twenty-one years of age. New Zealand was not
then a British colony, but Mr. Maning acquired land from the
Ngapuhi tribe at Hokianga, and took up his residence among the
Maoris at Onaki, and rapidly acquired a thorough acquaintance with
the laws and customs of the Maoris. This led to his being appointed
a judge in the Native Lands Court, in which capacity he served for
many years. He had lived among the Maoris, and looked upon himself
as a "Pakeha Maori," by which name he was generally known. He
published an interesting book embodying his experiences among the
natives, called "Old New Zealand, by a Pakeha Maori." This is
regarded as the most admirable picture of life in New Zealand in
the olden time ever issued; it was republished in London in 1876,
with a preface by the Earl of Pembroke. Mr. Maning died in London
on July 25th, 1883. His only other published work was a small book
entitled "The War in the North," which gave an account of the first
Maori insurrection under Honi Heki and its suppression by the
Imperial forces. The story is told from the Maori point of view. It
is appended to Lord Pembroke's edition of "Old New Zealand." Judge
Maning married a Maori wife. He rendered considerable services to
the English in the Honi Heki war in 1845, and later in the war
of  1861, which he was able to do from his great influence
with the Ngapuhi tribe, the most powerful and advanced tribe in New
Zealand, amongst whom he was naturalised.</p>

March 11th, 1820. Having emigrated to Wellington, N.Z., in 1840, he
was appointed in 1848 a Commissioner for Extinguishing Native
Titles in the Middle Island of New Zealand; and, by promises of
various small concessions, succeeded in buying out the claims of
the Maoris to 30,000,000 acres of land for about £5000 in cash.
Greatly to his disgust, however, the promises he had made on behalf
of the Government were not subsequently fulfilled; and being in
London in 1856, when some of the principal of them were being
broken, he appealed to Mr. Labouchere, then Secretary for the
Colonies, to interfere in the matter. Mr. Labouchere declined to
give him an interview; and finding his written  remonstrances
unavailing, Mr. Mantell resigned his official posts, being out of
harmony with the native policy of both the Imperial and Colonial
Governments. Mr. Mantell was Minister for Native Affairs in
the  Fox  Ministry from July to Dec. 1861; and
Postmaster-General and Secretary for Crown Lands under Mr.
Domett, in August 1862. He was again Minister for Native Affairs in
the Weld Administration from Dec. 1864 to July 1865; and also,
concurrently, Native Secretary from April to July 1865. Mr. Mantell
was for some time a member of the House of Representatives, and in
1866 was nominated to the Legislative Council. Some of the most
important ameliorative measures passed in the interest of the
Maoris were due to his initiative, and in his place in Parliament
he never failed to protest against measures regarding them which
savoured of injustice. He married first, on July 29th, 1863, Mary
Sarah, daughter of Edward Prince; and secondly, on Jan. 10th, 1876,
Jane, daughter of Benjamin Hardwick, of Beckenham, England. Mr.

<p><a name="A927" id="A927"></a><b>Martin, Arthur Patchett</b>,
F.R.G.S., was born at Woolwich, Kent, on Feb. 18th, 1851. He is the
son of George Martin and Eleanor (Hill) his wife, whose families
were settled in Kent and Surrey, but who were both, on the maternal
side, of Scottish extraction. When about eighteen months old, he
was taken out by his parents to Melbourne, arriving in Hobson's Bay
at Christmas, 1852. At St. Mark's Church of England School,
Fitzroy, Mr. Martin received his education until he matriculated at
Melbourne University, subsequently entering the Civil Service. In
the meantime his literary bent had strongly declared itself; and at
the Eclectic Society of Victoria, where he succeeded the founder,
Mr. H. K. Rusden, as secretary, he was for many years a leading
essayist and debater. During his secretaryship the Society
contributed to the memorial statue to  John Stuart Mill,
erected on the Thames Embankment. Mr. Martin was the principal
organiser of the meeting which took place at the Melbourne Town
Hall on July 29th, 1878, "to express public appreciation of the
services of the Earl of Beaconsfield in the settlement of the
Eastern Question." Out of the Eclectic Society arose the
Melbourne Review, a high-class quarterly periodical, which existed
from Jan. 1876 to Oct. 1885, and of which Mr. Martin acted as
editor, being also one of the most frequent contributors, until he
left Melbourne for London in 1882. Before leaving Victoria Mr.
Martin contributed to various Christmas and other collections, and
had published: "Sweet Girl Graduate" (a novelette), "Lays of
To-Day, or Verses in Jest and Earnest," and "Fernshawe," the latter
an octavo volume consisting of essays and poems, several of which
had first seen the light in the pages of the  Melbourne
Review. Since coming to reside in London, Mr. Martin has largely
devoted himself to journalistic work; but, in addition, has written
in several of the magazines, introducing the Australian poet,
Adam Lindsay Gordon, to the English literary public by an article
in  Temple Bar  of Feb. 1884. His most solid achievement,
however, was the publication of a work entitled "Australia and the
Empire," specially dedicated to the First Lord of the Treasury, Mr.
Balfour. The opening essay in this work, entitled "Robert Lowe in
Sydney," formed the nucleus of the undertaking on which Mr. Martin
is now engaged&mdash;the complete political biography of Lord
Sherbrooke. Among other literary efforts in London may be mentioned
"Oak-bough and Wattle-blossom," the first of those collective
stories by "Australians in England" of which there are now quite a
series. "Over-the-Sea Stories for the Children of Two Worlds" a
profusely illustrated gift-book, is also a collection by Mr.
Martin. In 1886 Mr. Martin married the only daughter of the late
Dr. J. M. Cookesley, of Boulogne-sur-Mer, who is also knows in the
literary world by translating of Alfred de Musset, as well as by
her poetical contributions to various periodicals.  Mrs.
Patchett Martin  has recently turned her early Queensland
experiences to account in "Under the Gum-tree" (1890), and "Cooëe"
(1891) an interesting collection of tales of Australian life by
Australian ladies. Since July 1891 Mr. Martin has been editor
of  Literary Opinion.</p>

<p><a name="A928" id="A928"></a><b>Martin, His Honour the Hon. Sir
James</b>, sometime Premier and Chief Justice of New South Wales,
was the son of John Martin, of Fermoy, Ireland, and Mary his wife,
daughter of David Hennessy, of Ballynona, and was born at
Middleton, in the county of Cork, on May 14th, 1820. His parents
emigrated to New South Wales the next year, so that Sir James was
virtually almost a native of Sydney, where he arrived in Nov. 1821.
He was educated at Cape's School and Sydney College; and, having
embraced the legal profession, was admitted a solicitor of the
Supreme Court of New South Wales in May 1845. In 1848 he commenced
to contribute to the  Atlas  newspaper, and three years
later to the  Empire, started by Mr. (now Sir)  Henry
Parkes. His political commenced contemporaneously with his
journalistic career, Mr. Martin being elected to the old
Legislative Council for Cook and Westmoreland in 1848. He was
unseated on petition, but was promptly re-elected unopposed; and
had the like good fortune in 1851. When the first Legislative
Assembly was constituted after the concession of responsible
government in New South Wales Mr. Martin was returned to the
popular chamber by his former constituents, his principal efforts
being in the meantime directed to diverting the Riverine trade from
Victoria, and to getting a branch of the Royal Mint established in
Sydney. Under the new constitutional  régime  he attached
himself strongly to the Liberal party, then led by Mr. (afterwards
Sir)  Charles Cowper. When the Conservative Administration of
Mr. Donaldson was defeated, in August 1856, Mr. Martin, though only
a solicitor, was appointed Attorney-General in the first
Cowper  Government; and so obnoxious had he made himself to
the anti-progressive party that the motion of censure carried
against the Government in the following October was mainly based on
the fact of his inclusion in it. Later in the year, however, Mr.
Martin was called to the bar; and thus the main objection raised to
his nomination was removed. He was therefore, without any
repetition of the previous clamour, reappointed Attorney-General by
Mr. Cowper on his return to power in Sept. 1857, being made Q.C. in
the same year. Mr. Martin resigned in Nov. 1858, and remained out
of office till Oct. 1863, when he himself formed a Ministry, in
which he took the Attorney-Generalship, in addition to acting as
Premier. Prior to this, in 1859, he had been elected one of the
four representatives of East Sydney under the system of manhood
suffrage inaugurated by the Electoral Act of 1858. A financial
deficit was bequeathed to the Martin Ministry by their
predecessors; and with the view of meeting it, the Treasurer,
Mr. Forster, in 1864, proposed a protective tariff, which was
adopted in the Assembly, but rejected in the Council. The
Government appealed to the country, but the response was a triumph
for the free-trade party; Mr. Martin, who now became member for the
Lachlan, being ejected from office in Jan. 1865, on a motion of no
confidence proposed by his old chief Mr. Cowper. The latter
gentleman now took the reins, but failed in meeting the necessities
of the financial situation; the result being that Mr. Martin was
recalled to power in Jan. 1866. He was fortunate in securing the
co-operation of Mr. (now Sir) Henry Parkes, who had led the assault
upon the Cowper Government, but who had, as a rule, acted in
opposition to Mr. Martin. The new Administration proved one of the
strongest ever formed in New South Wales; and, if it had performed
nothing else, would be memorable for its great achievement in
passing the Public Schools Act for the extension of elementary
education to all parts of the colony, as well as to all classes of
the community. Mr. Martin being a nominal Catholic, his action on
this question marked his final breach with the ecclesiastical
authorities of that communion. In Sept. 1868 Mr. Parkes resigned,
and the Ministry only held together a month longer. During their
tenure of office the Duke of Edinburgh visited the colony, and was
shot at by the would-be assassin O'Farrell. As a memento of the
general loyalty displayed during his visit (despite this untoward
outrage), and of the official attentions he received, the
ex-Premier was knighted by patent in 1869. In Dec. 1870 Mr. Martin
formed his third Administration, which lasted till May 1872, and in
which he was Attorney-General and Vice-President of the Executive
Council, as well as Premier. He was succeeded by Mr. Parkes, who in
Nov. 1873 appointed Sir James Martin Chief Justice of New South
Wales&mdash;a post Mr. Parkes' Attorney-General (Mr. Butler)
believed to be his due, and resigned in consequence of his not
being offered it. In the following year Sir James Martin protested
against the action of Sir  Hercules Robinson, then Governor of
New South Wales, in not appointing an administrator of the
government during his absence in Fiji, and claiming the position as
an appanage of his office as Chief Justice of the colony for the
time being. In order to obviate the recurrence of any similar
difficulty, Sir  Alfred Stephen  was subsequently
appointed permanent Lieutenant-Governor. Sir James Martin, who was
elected a member of the senate of Sydney University in 1858,
married, in 1853, Isabella, eldest daughter of the late William
Long, of Sydney. In 1865 he received the Queen's permission to bear
the title of Honourable within the colony, after ceasing to be a
member of the Executive Council. During the latter years of his
life, Sir James Martin was recognised by all classes as one of the
most distinguished men of Australia, and he particularly impressed
Mr. Froude, the English historian, who records his impression of
him in "Oceana" as that of a man who would have worthily filled the
office of Lord Chief Justice of England. He died in Sydney on Nov.
4th, 1886.</p>

<p><a name="A929" id="A929"></a><b>Martin, Sir William</b>, M.A.,
D.C.L., the son of Henry Martin, of Birmingham, was born in 1807,
and educated at St. John's College, Cambridge, where he was Scholar
from 1826 to 1831, and graduated B.A. as 26th wrangler and 2nd
Chancellor's medallist in 1829. In 1831 he was elected Fellow of
St. John's College, and having taken the M.A. degree in 1832,
he  was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1836. In 1838 he
resigned his fellowship, and in 1841 he was appointed Chief Justice
of New Zealand, and went to that colony in company with the newly
appointed Attorney-General, Mr.  Swainson. During his long
career in the colony Sir William Martin had great experience of the
Maoris, and on several occasions pleaded in public on their behalf.
In 1847 he joined with Bishop  Selwyn  in protesting
against the instructions of the Colonial Office regarding the
treatment of the Maori lands, and published a pamphlet, "England
and the New Zealanders." Subsequently, in 1861, he issued another
pamphlet upon the Waitara question, entering into controversy with
Mr.  Richmond, the native minister, upon the subject. Once
more, in 1863, he protested against the New Zealand Settlements
Act, which embodied a policy of confiscation, and throughout his
public career may be said generally to have contended for the
validity of the Treaty of Waitangi. Sir William Martin, who was
knighted in 1860, and received the honorary degree of D.C.L. from
the University of Oxford in July 1858, retired on a pension, and
died at Torquay, on Nov. 18th, 1880. He was the intimate friend of
Bishops Selwyn and  Patteson, and assisted the former in
drawing up the New Zealand Church Constitution. Sir William married
in 1841 Mary, daughter of the Rev. W. Parker, rector of St.
Ethelburga, Bishopsgate, London, and Prebendary of St. Paul's. Sir
William Martin was one of the most skilled linguists of his day,
and after his return to England issued a work entitled "Inquiries
concerning the Structure of the Semitic Languages," which was
published in two parts in 1876 and 1878.</p>

Farrington on May 25th, 1847, and was educated at King Edward's
School, Birmingham. After considerable experience of engineering
work in Wales and America, Mr. Mason went to Fiji, and from 1874 to
1877 was engaged in the railway branch of the Department of Public
Works, New South Wales. In 1877 he was appointed resident engineer
of the Geraldton and Northampton Railway, Western Australia, and
superintended the construction of the Point Moore Lighthouse, and
other public works in the Victoria district. He was afterwards
resident engineer for four years of the Eastern Railway in the same
colony; Acting Commissioner of Railways on two occasions during
1882 and 1883, and was provisionally appointed in 1884 Director of
Public Works and Commissioner of Railways, with a seat in the
Executive and Legislative Councils. In June 1885, on the arrival of
the Hon.  J. Wright, he retired from the Executive and
Legislative Councils, and was appointed General Manager and
Maintenance Engineer of the Western Australian Railways. In Jan.
1890, in consequence of the resignation of Mr. Wright, he was
appointed Commissioner of Railways and a member of the Executive
Council, which position he held till the introduction of
responsible government early in 1891, and from that time till June
1st in the same year he continued to discharge the duties of
General Manager of Railways and Engineer of Existing Lines, when,
in consequence of departmental changes, he was appointed Collector
of Customs for the colony. Mr. Mason married in 1879 Julia,

Sutherlandshire, Scotland, in 1821; was educated at the local
schools, and made his first start in life at the early age of
fourteen, when he was invited to join his uncles in Tasmania, then
Van Diemen's Land. The youthful emigrant sailed from Cromarty to
London in a fishing smack, and only reached Hobart Town after a
tedious voyage of several months. He was employed in a merchant's
office until 1838, and when the Union Bank of Australia opened a
branch at Hobart Town Mr. Matheson joined the staff. He served the
Bank both in Hobart Town and Launceston until he was promoted to be
accountant, and in 1845 was appointed manager at Geelong, in the
colony of Victoria. In 1851 he was appointed chief manager of the
Union Bank in Australia. In Jan. 1853 he resigned his connection
with his old bank, having accepted the general managership of
the  when newly formed Bank of Victoria&mdash;an appointment
he held for many years. In 1859 Mr. Matheson visited England, and
established the Bank of Victoria's London office, rejoining the
head office in Melbourne in 1861. In the meantime he became
considerably interested in station property in Victoria and New
South Wales. Upon the retirement of Mr.  D. C. M?Arthur
he was elected chairman of the associated banks. In 1877 he again
left for England, and died on May 10th, 1882.</p>

by the Church Missionary Society, and was educated at Trinity
College, Dublin, where he graduated B .A. in 1832. In 1834 he went
out to New Zealand in connection with the Church Missionary
Society, and for many years lived as a missionary among the Maoris.
In 1840 he was one of those who were instrumental in framing
the  Treaty of Waitangi, and in getting the native chiefs to
sign it. Subsequently, in 1846, he joined with Bishop
Selwyn  and Sir  William Martin  in a protest
against Earl Grey's instructions, by which it was considered the
treaty was violated. Archdeacon Maunsell is especially
distinguished for his translation of the Bible into Maori, and also
for his Maori Grammar. He shares with Mr.  Colenso  the
honour of being the greatest living authority on the Maori tongue.
After thirty years of labour as a missionary, Mr. Maunsell was
appointed Incumbent of St. Mary's, Auckland, in 1865, and was

<p><a name="A939" id="A939"></a><b>Melba, Madame (Helen Porter
Armstrong)</b>, the Australian prima donna, is the daughter of
David Mitchell (who emigrated to Victoria from Forfarshire, and who
has been a builder in a large way of business in Melbourne, besides
owning a good deal of pastoral property). Her mother was Isabel A.
Dow, the daughter of J. F. Dow, to whom her father was married in
1857. She was born in Melbourne (hence her stage name), and was
married in 1882 to Charles Nisbett Frederick Armstrong, sixth son
of Sir Archibald Armstrong, first baronet, of Gallen Priory, King's
County, Ireland, who had settled in Queensland. Mrs. Armstrong
began to learn music at three years of age, and played and sang in
public in Melbourne when only six. Her parents were, however,
averse to her becoming a professional vocalist, and it was not
until her marriage with Captain Armstrong that she was able to give
free scope to what was from an early age her decided bent. In 1886
she came with her husband and parents to London, and made one or
two essays at concert-singing in public with no very marked
success. She was not, however, discouraged, and commenced a course
of training under the well-known Parisian teacher Madame Marchési,
who considered her voice so good that she undertook that Mrs.
Armstrong should be ready for the stage in eighteen months. This
promise was more than fulfilled for exactly twelve months after her
first lesson Madame Melba appeared as "Gilda" at the Brussels
Opera. Later on she was engaged for the Grand Opera, Paris, where
she appeared with M. Lassalle, the famous baritone, in
Hamlet. Her Ophelia was warmly praised by the press, and a
brilliant career was predicted for her. Whilst studying with Madame
Marchési she learnt the leading rôles of ten operas in ten months,
said by her teacher to be an almost unheard-of achievement.
Operatic deportment was studied by Madame Melba under M. Plaque.
Her fame had by this time spread to England, and she was engaged in
1888 by Sir Augustus Harris to appear at Covent Garden in the opera
of  Lucia di Lammermoor. The performance was cautiously
praised by the critics, who were more enthusiastic when she sang
with M. Jean de Reszké in Gounod's  Romeo et Juliette. Amongst
the rôles which she played during this and succeeding seasons at
Covent Garden were Lucia, Lakné, Elsa, Marguerite, and Esmeralda.
Madame Melba had the advantage of being personally instructed by M.
Gounod in the interpretation of his music, especially in the
rôles  of Juliette and Marguerite. In Jan. 1891 she sang at
St. Petersburg, with the brothers De Reszké, by special command of
the Czar of Russia, and played a successful round of parts in the
principal European capitals. In 1892 she again appeared at Covent
Garden, and she has been engaged with the brothers De Reszké for a
grand tour of the United States in the "Exhibition year" (1893). It
has for some time past been Madame Melba's intention to revisit
Australia, in order to give her compatriots an opportunity of
forming a judgment on her natural powers as a public singer, but up
to date she has found it impossible to secure leisure for so
prolonged a tour.</p>

<p><a name="A940" id="A940"></a><b>Melville, Ninian</b>, M.L.A.,
Chairman of Committees, Legislative Assembly, New South Wales, son
of Ninian Melville and Catherine (Hayes) his wife, was born in
Sydney on Dec. 29th, 1843. Mr. Melville, who was formerly an
alderman and  Mayor of Newtown, has sat in the New South Wales
Legislative Assembly since 1880. He is member for Northumberland,
and is well known as a teetotal advocate and orator. He has been
Chairman of Committees and Deputy-Speaker since 1890, and being a
cabinet-maker by trade, made the chair which he now occupies by
virtue of his office with his own hands in 1886. He married on Dec.
29th, 1869, Mary, daughter of Thomas Brooks.</p>

<p><a name="A941" id="A941"></a><b>Menpes, Mortimer</b>, the
well-known painter and etcher, is a native of South Australia, and
was born at Port Adelaide. He showed at an early period a talent
for painting, and was fortunate enough to have for a schoolmaster
the Rev. Mr. Garrett, who did much to develop and refine the mind
of his pupil. When Mr. Menpes was about nineteen years of age he
came with his father to London, and soon after married Miss Rose
Grosse, an Australian and a ward of his father. At South
Kensington, under Poynter and Sparkes, Mr. Menpes promptly won his
spurs, and took the Poynter prize for the best drawing done in all
the schools of art in England. He afterwards studied nature for
three years in Brittany. As early as 1880 Mr. Menpes' etchings
received high commendation and notice. He was an exhibitor at the
Royal Academy in that year, and became a member of the Society of
British Artists in 1885. By this time the original character of Mr.
Menpes' work was acknowledged. He was a friend and admirer of James
MacNeil Whistler, and it was the custom to speak of Mr. Whistler as
his master. Much as he had learnt from Mr. Whistler, it became
evident, however, that the pupil was not to be bounded by the
reputation of his master. In 1887 Mr. Menpes went to Japan to paint
and came back a celebrity. His exhibition of Japanese pictures at
Dowdeswell's galleries in New Bond Street in 1888 created a
sensation. Mr. Menpes had assimilated Whistlerism in port, but had
made dominant something that was his own. The years that he had
spent in France, Germany, Spain, and Holland were now productive of
a new style and a new name in the annals of painting. Since 1888
Mr. Menpes has paid two visits to India, to study and paint the
life there, and early in 1891 he held an exhibition of the fruits
of his labours in the East. Mr. Menpes has contributed to
the Magazine of Art on Japanese art, his views on etching
and dry-point being considered especially interesting and novel.
That Mr. Menpes is no mere artistic dilettante may be gathered from
the fact that he has been a constant prize-winner as a crack
rifleman. In 1891 Mr. Menpes visited Venice, and on his return held
his third exhibition in 1892. The number of pictures was limited to
fifty-six, but they were characterised by much better and more
thorough workmanship than his paintings had previously shown, and
even the smallest canvases exhibit the breadth and depth which as a
follower of the Dutch school it has always been the artist's object
to depict; but his effects are far more luminous than most workers
in the same style have hitherto obtained; and the sales on this
occasion were phenomenal, every picture being disposed of before
the exhibition had been open forty-eight hours. His first
noticeable work in England was his etching of "The Sabot Shop,"
which appeared in 1881 in the Art Journal. This was a Brittany
reminiscence. It is in dry-point that Mr. Menpes mainly excels, but
he has done equally distinctive work as an etcher and in
water-colours and oils. In 1889 he contributed some excellent
sketches in dry-point to "The Grey River," a work of which the
letter- press was from the pens of Mrs. Campbell Praed and Mr.
Justin McCarthy. Mr. Menpes has a penchant for small
canvases, but he can boast of having produced the largest thing
ever done in dry-point from Frans Hals, "The Banquet of the
Officers of the Archers of St. Adrian" (or Andrew), painted in
1627. A feature of his Indian exhibition was his unique application
of dry-point to ivory&mdash;unique, if not in practice, at least in
results. His dry-point of the late Cardinal Manning is a fine work,
and his adaptability is shown by the success of his chalk drawings
of Manning, Whistler, Toole, Ada Rehan, and M. H. Spielmann. The
artistic results of the next country he will visit and portray on
canvas will probably be exhibited in the larger cities of America
before they are seen in London. In the spring season of 1893 Mr.
Menpes will open his new house in Cadogan Gardens, where he will
make a new departure in portraiture, his object being to
make his works represent pictures first and portraits
afterwards. The house, which is being built, decorated, and
tarnished from his own designs, will be an ideal artist's house
from his own point of view, and will contain two studios and a
small picture-gallery with a top light.</p>

descended in a direct line from the last kings of Wales, was the
son of George Meredith (born in Birmingham), and of his wife Sarah
Westall Hicks. Charles Meredith was born at Poyston Lodge,
Pembroke, May 29th, 1811, and with his father and other members of
his family emigrated to Tasmania, arriving at Hobart on March 18th,
1821. After some early years of varied and adventurous life, he
became a successful squatter in New South Wales; and, revisiting
England in 1838, married, at Old Edgbaston Church, Birmingham, his
cousin, Louisa Anne Twamley, of that city, April 18th, 1839.
Returning with his wife to New South Wales, Mr. Meredith, after a
year's residence there, removed to Tasmania, where he remained, and
was, during a period of thirty-eight years, a prominent member of
the House of Assembly. In the second Tasmanian Ministry formed
after the concession of responsible government, he held the post of
Colonial Treasurer under Mr. Gregson, Feb. 26th to April 25th,
1857. He held the same position in the Whyte Ministry from Jan.
20th, 1863, to Nov. 24th, 1866. He was Minister of Lands and Works
in the Innes Ministry from Nov. 4th, 1872, to Aug. 4th, 1873, and
Colonial Treasurer in the Reibey Ministry from July 20th, 1876, to
August 9th, 1877. He was a staunch free-trader, and in 1866, when
Treasurer, he introduced a measure for the abolition of Customs
duties (except those on spirits and tobacco), and the substitution
of trade licences and a land or property tax; but the proposal led
to the defeat of the Government. Among the many measures which Mr.
Charles Meredith introduced into Parliament, the one most
gratifying to himself was an Act for the protection of the native
black swans, then in danger of extermination; and this, although at
first received with derision, eventually passed, and was succeeded
by other valuable enactments for the preservation of native birds
and animals. Heart-disease compelled him to resign his seat in
1879. He died in Launceston, Tasmania, March 2nd, 1880. A public
fountain, erected to his memory, was placed in the Queen's Domain,
Hobart, in 1885.</p>

Anne</b> (née Twamley), daughter of Thomas Twamley, of
Hamptead, near Birmingham, where she was born on July 20th, 1812,
was chiefly educated by her accomplished mother, and at an early
age wrote verses and practised art with ardour and success. In 1833
she published an octavo volume of "Poems with Illustrations"
(Tilt), the latter being etchings on copper from her own original
drawings. The book was most favourably reviewed, and the novelty of
a girl-poet being also artist and engraver excited considerable
interest. Her "Romance of Nature" was a beautiful and costly volume
in verse and prose, with hand-coloured plates from her own
drawings&mdash;the 3rd edition published in 1839 (Tilt). "Our Wild
Flowers" told the story of the year in a narrative form, with many
poems introduced, the plates hand-coloured from the author's
drawings. "A Tour in South Wales" and "An Autumn on the Wye" (Tilt)
were illustrated with engravings after David Cox, Cattermole, etc.
On April 18th, 1839, Miss Twamley married at Old Edgbaston Church,
Birmingham, her cousin, Charles Meredith, and accompanied him on
his return to Australia. Her "Notes and Sketches of New South
Wales," published in Murray's "Home and Colonial Library," was one
of the most popular volumes of that excellent series. It was
followed, some years after, by "My Home in Tasmania" (Murray), with
landscape illustrations by the Bishop of Tasmania (Dr. Nixon) and
the author. "Over the Straits" (Chapman &amp; Hall) was the
narrative of a visit to Melbourne and the goldfields in 1856.
" Lost" was the short life of a pet bird, told in poem and
picture. In 1860 appeared "Some of my Bush Friends in Tasmania,"
published by Day &amp; Sons, a large and elaborate work on the
flora of the colony, with numerous coloured plates from the
author's drawings, and original poems and prose. "Ebba," a novel,
first appeared as a serial in the Australasian, then was
published by Tinsley. "Grandmamma's Verse-Book for Young
Australia," poems for children on local subjects, was printed in
Hobart for the author. "Tasmanian Friends and Foes, Furred,
Feathered and Finned," is also a book for young people, with
coloured plates from the author's drawings (1880: Marcus Ward). In
recognition of her life of scientific, artistic and literary work
in the colony, Mrs. Meredith was long since elected an honorary
member of the Tasmanian Royal Society, and was granted by the
Government a pension of £100 a year. Prize medals have been awarded
to her for botanical drawings of Tasmanian subjects, in the
Exhibitions of London, 1862; Melbourne, 1866 and 1881; Sydney, 1870
and 1875; and Calcutta, 1884. A second series of "Bush Friends in
Tasmania" is now in the press&mdash;Mrs. Meredith having made the
voyage home, after an absence of fifty-one years, for the purpose
of publishing her last book.</p>

K.C.M.G., Q.C., sometime Agent-General, Victoria, is the son of the
late Archibald Michie, of Maida Vale, a merchant in London, where
he was born in 1818. He was educated at Westminster School, entered
at the Middle Temple in Nov. 1834, and was called to the Bar in May
1838. In the following year Mr. Michie emigrated to Sydney, and
practised his profession there with success. In the New South Wales
capital he devoted much of his time to journalism, and acted as a
law reporter, ultimately becoming associated with Mr. Robert Lowe
(the late Lord Sherbrooke) in the conduct of
the Atlas newspaper, started in 1844 to champion the then
current phase of local Liberalism. After revisiting England, Mr.
Michie returned to Australia in 1852, taking up his abode in
Victoria, where the discovery of gold and the concession of
separation from New South Wales served to open up the brightest
prospects of prosperous activity. He was at once admitted to the
Victorian Bar, and on Oct. 26th, 1852, was nominated by the
Government a non-elective member of the Legislative Council, as the
single House of Parliament was then called. At the close of his
second session Mr. Michie resigned his seat and devoted himself to
the practice of his profession and to journalistic pursuits. From
1854 to 1856 he was proprietor of the Melbourne Herald, a
morning paper, which involved him in loss. When the Ballarat
rioters were placed on their trial after the affair of the Eureka
stockade, Mr. Michie volunteered his services for their
defence without fee. In 1856 responsible government was inaugurated
in Victoria under the imperial act passed in the previous year, and
Mr. Michie was returned to the newly created Legislative Assembly
as one of the members for Melbourne, having as colleagues Sir (then
Mr.) John O'Shanassy, Sir (then Mr.) William Foster Stawell,
and Messrs. David Moore and J. T. Smith. In April 1857 he accepted
office in the second Haines Ministry as Attorney-General
and retired with his colleagues in March 1858. In August 1859 Mr.
Michie became M.L.A. for St. Kilda, and sat till the general
election in 1861, when he was not a candidate. When that most
remarkable of Victorian Ministries the
first M?Culloch Government came into office in June 1863,
with Mr. George Higinbotham as Attorney-General, Mr.
Michie was offered the post of Minister of Justice, and joined them
in July, being re-elected to the Assembly for Polwarth and
Grenville. Mr. Michie resigned office in the M?Culloch Government
in July 1866, and in the same year was returned for St. Kilda, and
in 1868 for South Gippsland. In the third M'Culloch Ministry Mr.
Michie was again Attorney-General from April 1870 to June 1871,
when he was defeated for South Gippsland, but was subsequently
returned to the Legislative Council. In 1872 Mr. Michie paid a
second visit to Europe, and on his return to Victoria in 1873 he
was appointed Agent-General of the colony in London by the Francis
Ministry. In May 1878 he was created K.C.M.G., and retiring from
the agent-generalship in the next year, returned to Melbourne. He
married in 1840 Mary, daughter of Dr. John Richardson,
Inspector-General of Hospitals. Sir Archibald Michie is a man of
very considerable literary culture, and has acted as Victorian
correspondent for the London Times for many years.</p>

Cricket Club. He played for Victoria against New South Wales in
nine intercolonial matches, commencing in 1875 and ending in 1887,
his batting average in those matches for 17 innings being 20.53
runs per innings, and he bowled 1,956 balls, taking 32 wickets at
an average cost of 16.81 runs per wicket. In 1877 Midwinter went to
England, and was immediately engaged by the Gloucestershire county
club, for whom he did yeoman service with both bat and ball, and
was also a prominent member of W. G. Grace's famous and
successful United South of England eleven. On the arrival of
Gregory's Australian eleven in the old country in 1878 Midwinter
joined them, but after he had taken part in the first five matches
he was compelled to sever his connection with the Australian team
on account of his previous English engagement. In 1880 he returned
to Australia for a trip, but went back to England, and his next
visit to the colonies was as a member of Shaw and Shrewsbury's
English eleven in 1881-82. He subsequently revisited England as a
member of Murdoch's Australian eleven in 1884, and after returning
to Melbourne was the lessee of various hotels in the city and
suburbs. He died at the Kew Asylum, near Melbourne, on Dec.

his preliminary education at the High School, Exeter, and
afterwards graduated M.A. at St John's College, Cambridge. He was
called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn, London, and practised his
profession for several years at Bristol, where he held the
appointment of judge of the Diocesan Ecclesiastical Court. Owing to
bad health, he was induced to seek an appointment in Australia.
Through the influence of his cousin Sir William Follett, the then
Attorney-General of England, .he was appointed Master in
Equity of New South Wales, and left London in Sept. 1842 for
Sydney. He landed on Jan. 1st, 1843, and held the post of Master in
Equity, together with that of Chief Commissioner of Insolvent
Estates, until his appointment as Resident Judge in the district of
Moreton Bay (now Queensland) in Jan. 1856. Thence he returned to
Sydney in Feb. 1859, and was a Supreme Court Judge till his death

B.A. in 1874. He entered at the Inner Temple in Nov. 1873, and was
called to the Bar in Nov. 1876, when he at once emigrated to
Queensland, where from 1879 to 1882 he held the office of Master of
Titles. In 1882 he was appointed Crown Prosecutor, and in November
of that year Judge of the Central District Court.</p>

<p><a name="A954" id="A954"></a><b>Miller, Hon. Henry</b>, was the
son of the late Captain Henry Miller, of H.M.'s 40th Regiment of
foot, who served with distinction in the Peninsular War, and was at
the battle of Waterloo. He was born at Londonderry on Dec. 31st,
1809. In 1823 his father proceeded with a detachment of his
regiment in charge of a batch of convicts to Sydney, his family
accompanying him. Shortly afterwards he was appointed commandant at
Moreton Bay, where he spent eighteen months, and was then
transferred to Van Diemen's Land, where he died at Hobart in 1866.
After the arrival of the family in what was afterwards Tasmania,
Mr. Miller obtained an appointment as an accountant in the audit
office at Hobart, and at the age of twenty-four married Eliza,
second daughter of the late Captain Mattinson of the Merchant
Service. In 1839 Mr. Miller visited Port Phillip, and subsequently
resigned his appointment in Tasmania, and came to Melbourne, where
he settled at Richmond. He was one of the promoters of the Bank of
Victoria, which was incorporated in Oct. 1852, and was elected as
the first chairman of directors, a post which he continued to
occupy up till his death. He also originated a number of Insurance
Companies and Building Societies. On the separation of Port Phillip
from New South Wales in 1851, Mr. Miller was elected to represent
South Bourke, Evelyn and Mornington, in the old Legislative
Council. In July 1852 Mr. Miller induced the Legislative Council to
petition the Queen to authorise the establishment of a branch of
the Royal mint in Melbourne. Mr. Miller supported the ballot, and
on the inauguration of the constitution in 1856 he was returned to
the Upper House for the Central province. On the formation of the
first O'Shanassy Administration, in March 1858, Mr. Miller became
Minister of Trade and Customs, and was sworn of the Executive
Council, and elected to the Legislative Council for the Western
province. In July 1866 he joined the
first M?Culloch Ministry as Commissioner of Railways, but
on going before his constituents he was defeated, and resigned
office in Jan. 1867, retiring thenceforward from public life. Mr.
Miller was a most successful speculator in Melbourne property, and
having conducted his investments with marvellous prudence, died on
Feb. 7th, 1888, leaving enormous wealth.</p>

<p><a name="A956" id="A956"></a><b>Miller, Hon. Maxwell</b>, third
son of Serjeant Miller, Judge of the Leicestershire County Court,
was born in London in the year 1832. He was educated at St. Paul's
School, whence he went up with a scholarship to Worcester College,
Oxford. Here he gained the Fitzgerald scholarship, which
transferred him to Queen's College. In 1852, at the instance of his
elder brother William, who had emigrated to Victoria, he sailed for
Melbourne. Soon after his arrival, Dr. Perry, the then Bishop of
Melbourne, offered him the appointment of Secretary to the Diocese.
This office he held until he obtained one of the two Inspectorships
of Education for Victoria, the other Inspector being Mr. (now the
Right Hon.) H. C. E. Childers. He resigned this office to
become one of the sub-editors of the Argus newspaper, and
shortly after his brother William and he received an invitation to
conduct a newspaper in Hobart, which was being started in the
Liberal interest. The Tasmanian Daily News was the
result, a paper which, though creditable for its literary matter
and effective as a political weapon, ended in heavy pecuniary loss
after two or three years' existence. On the introduction of
responsible government in 1856, Mr. Miller was returned to the
House of Assembly as a member for Hobart, and soon made his mark as
a debater. In conjunction with Mr. (now Sir F.) Smith, he
introduced the scheme of Superior Education and endowed Tasmanian
scholarships, which remained in force in the colony for some
twenty-five years until the recent establishment of the Tasmanian
University. Mr. Miller held office without portfolio in the
short-lived ministry of Mr. Gregson, from Feb. 26th to April 1857.
In 1863 Mr. Miller resigned his seat, and accepted the appointment
of assistant-clerk to the House, an office which he held until
within a short time of his death, which took place at Hobart, April
10th, 1867. Mr. Miller was a brother of Mr. Robert Byron

<p><a name="A960" id="A960"></a><b>Mitchell, Sir Thomas
Livingstone</b>, D.C.L., a well-known explorer and sometime
Surveyor-General of New South Wales, was the eldest son of John
Mitchell, of Grangemouth, and was born at Craigend, Stirlingshire,
in 1792. He entered the army in 1808, and served through the most
stirring scenes of the Peninsular war. He was afterwards employed
in making surveys of the great battlefields of the Peninsula and
published a series of military maps which are preserved in the
Ordnance Office. He was made Surveyor-General of New South Wales in
1827, and devoted the next twenty-eight years to the task of
exploration and the laying out of Australian towns and roads. In
Nov. 1831 he started from Sydney with a party to find a passage to
the interior of the continent, and ultimately reached the Darling.
Here he waited for supplies from a permanent depôt, which he had
established on the Nammoy. But when his assistant, Finch, arrived,
he had no provisions with him, but only a sad tale to tell how the
camp had been surprised by the blacks, the two men in charge
murdered, and the cattle and most of the stores carried off. This
put an end to the expedition. Mitchell returned to the depôt, where
he buried the bodies of his two murdered assistants, and then
retraced his steps to Sydney. Again in March 1835 Mitchell started
with a strong party, amongst whom was Allan Cunningham, the
botanist. When they reached the Bogan, Cunningham was missed. A
search was at once instituted, but he was never found. His tracks
were followed for seventy miles; his horse was found dead; his whip
and gloves were also picked up. Afterwards the melancholy facts
were revealed. Cunningham had lost his way, and wandered about for
five days, when he fell in with some natives. At first they treated
him kindly, but the horrible nature of his position overpowered his
strength, and he became delirious. This sealed the poor fellow's
fate. The natives became terrified at their strange guest, and
murdered him. After this Mitchell continued his exploration of the
Bogan for some time, but an unfortunate encounter with the natives,
in which three of them were killed, induced the speedy return of
the expedition to Sydney. His next expedition was into Australia
Felix, as he styled the rich pastoral districts of what is now
known as Victoria, in 1836. Mitchell's party started on March 17th,
and soon reached the Lachlan, which they explored for a
considerable distance. On the Murray an encounter with the natives,
took place, in which seven of them were killed. On June 20th the
party reached the Loddon Junction. On the third day they lost the
Loddon, and then went through a pastoral country, past the Avon and
Avoca rivers, obtained a fine view of the Grampians&mdash;so named
by Mitchell&mdash;fell in with a deep creek, the Richardson river,
and at length came to the Wimmera. A few days afterwards they came
upon and named the Glenelg. Striking southwards, they descried the
sea and came upon the settlement of the Hentys, formed three years
before at Portland, Vict., as a whaling station. When the party
again reached Sydney, they had traversed two thousand four hundred
miles of magnificent country. Mitchell named it Australia Felix, or
the Happy. He was knighted in 1839, and made an honorary D.C.L. of
the university of Oxford. In 1845 he undertook another expedition
to explore the Darling. The party included Mr. E. B. Kennedy,
a young surveyor in the Government service, Dr. Stevenson, and
twenty-six men; they had provisions for a year. The start was made
from Parramatta. They reached the Macquarie, and from thence
crossed to the Upper Darling. Advancing beyond the Darling and
making direct for the tropic, he found himself within a network of
streams, taking their rise in the Dividing Range and flowing
through broad tablelands. Mitchell's chief discovery was the Barcoo
river, which he named the Victoria. In 1851 he was sent to report
on the Bathurst goldfields in New South Wales. On his first visit
to England he had taken with him a large collection of specimens,
amongst which were the first gold given him by the shepherd
Macgregor and the first diamond discovered in the country,
presented to him by Thomas Hale. On a second visit he patented the
boomerang propeller for steamers. He published "Battlefields of the
Peninsula," "Three Expeditions into the Interior of Australia"
(1838), "Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Australia,"
"Australian Geography" (for the use of schools), besides numerous
maps of his surveys in Australia. He also translated "The Lusiad,"
by Camoens. It may be added that in 1843 Sir Thomas Mitchell
unsuccessfully contested Port Phillip for a seat in the New South
Wales Legislature. The next year, however, he was elected. The
distance from Sydney made the attendance of Port Phillip residents
in Parliament so difficult that three out of six members allotted
to the district and to Melbourne resigned, and two who took their
seats in 1844 were Government officers, vis., the Surveyor-General
and the Sheriff. The former was now warned by the Governor, Sir
George Gipps, that, though in his private capacity he was welcome
to his opinions, as Surveyor-General he must support the
Government. Sir Thomas thereupon immediately resigned his seat.
Subsequently the Governor appointed a board to inquire into the
working of his department, a step which pained him greatly. He died
at Darling Point, Sydney, on Feb. 5th, 1855.</p>

<p><a name="A961" id="A961"></a><b>Mitchell, Hon. Sir William Henry
Fancourt</b>, M.L.C., who was for fourteen years President of the
Legislative Council of Victoria, was the son of the Rev. George
Barkley Mitchell, vicar of St. Mary's and All Saints', Leicester,
and chaplain to the late Duke of York. He arrived in Tasmania at a
very early age, and for a time filled the office of acting Colonial
Secretary. He went to Port Phillip about 1840. and engaged in
squatting pursuits, taking up country in the neighbourhood of
Kyneton. At the time of the first gold discoveries, when the police
were in a very disorganised state, the Lieutenant-Governor,
Mr. La Trobe, appointed him Chief Commissioner of Police, with
almost unlimited powers, and the result was that after a time a
tolerably efficient force was created. He introduced the cadet
system by promising a number of young fellows commissions and
outfits as police cadets on their passing through a successful
probation in chasing bushrangers and doing escort duty. Bushranging
was by this means to a great extent stamped out Captain (afterwards
Sir) Charles Macmahon was appointed by the Chief
Commissioner as head of the city police, and Mitchell going home on
leave of absence, Macmahon succeeded him as acting Chief
Commissioner. On his return in Sept. 1856 he entered political
life, and was elected to the Legislative Council as one of the five
original members for the north-western province, for which he was
re-elected whilst he remained in public life. Mr. Mitchell was
Postmaster-General of Victoria in the Haines Government
from April 1857 to March 1858, during which time he effected an
almost total reorganisation of the department. He was Commissioner
for Railways from Dec. 1861 until June 1863 in the
third O'Shanassy administration. In March 1869 he was
elected Chairman of Committees of the Legislative Council, and
retained that office until Oct. 1870, when, on the retirement of
Sir James F. Palmer, he was elected President. In 1875 he
received the honour of knighthood, and was five times re-elected
President of the Upper House of the Victorian Legislature prior to
his final retirement in Nov. 1884. He died on Nov. 4th,
1884.</p>

M.A. in 1833. Having been called to the Irish Bar in 1828, he
joined the Munster circuit, and soon afterwards published a book on
a legal subject which attracted some attention. In the year 1852 he
emigrated to Adelaide. The gold discoveries of that and the
preceding year, however, had made Melbourne a much more promising
field, and in 1853 he came to Victoria, and was admitted to the
local Bar. During the absence on leave of Sir W.

25th, 1855, and retained the position until June 17th, 1856, when
he was created a Judge of the Supreme Court. It was as Primary
Judge in Equity that his chief work was afterwards done. When Judge
Molesworth first took his seat on the Bench there was no such
office, it being the custom of the Supreme Court judges to dispose
of the equity business in turns. Shortly after his elevation to the

which one of the judges was assigned exclusively to the business of
the equity side. Judge Molesworth's special legal qualifications
pointed him out as eminently suited for this position, and he was
made Primary Judge in Equity, an office which he held with great
credit to himself and satisfaction to the Bar and to suitors until
April 1886, when he retired in his eightieth year on account of
failing health. Judge Molesworth occasionally sat on the criminal
side and in other jurisdictions, in all of which he showed marked
ability, but his duties during the greater portion of the year were
confined to the Equity Court, and hardly any of his decisions were
successfully appealed against. Judge Molesworth performed important
service in connection with local mining law. He may be said, in
fact, to have formed it. As chief judge of the Court of Mines he
had to deal with the various conflicting bye-laws of the different
mining divisions. He was so successful in evolving order out of
chaos that there were very few mining appeals from the inferior
courts. Though very impatient of nonsense, the judge had a dry
humour of his own, and he would not unfrequently cap a classical
quotation. He never left the colony after his arrival, except for a
short visit to New Zealand. He was knighted on his retirement in
1886. Sir Robert Molesworth married on Jan. 6th, 1840, Henrietta,
daughter of the Rev. Joseph England Johnson (who died in 1879). He
died on Oct. 18th, 1890.</p>

<p><a name="A970" id="A970"></a><b>Montgomery, William</b>, was
born in 1822 in London of an Ulster family, and educated at
Belfast. He went to sea in early life, and was in command of a
trading vessel at eighteen, but subsequently migrated to Australia,
from whence he went in 1860 to Canterbury, N.Z., settling there as
a merchant. Mr. Montgomery was concerned for many years in
provincial politics, and in 1868-70 was Provincial Treasurer and
subsequently President of the Executive Council. In 1874 he was
returned to the House of Representatives as member for Akaroa,
which he represented till his withdrawal from politics in 1887. Mr.
Montgomery refused the office of Colonial Treasurer in
the Grey Ministry of 1877; but was Leader of the
Opposition against the Atkinson Cabinet which succeeded.
On August 16th, 1884, he accepted the offices of Colonial Secretary
and Minister of Education in the Stout-Vogel Ministry,
but held these for the briefest time, as the Government was
defeated on August 28th. Later (Sept. 3rd), when the Stout-Vogel
combination again came into power, Mr. Montgomery declined to take
office. He retired from Parliament in 1887. Mr. Montgomery has been
prominently connected with educational matters in the colony,
having been at one time Chairman of the Canterbury Board of
Education, and Chairman of the Board of Governors of Canterbury
College from 1876 to 1885.</p>

1834. After a preliminary training at the Collegiate School in
Tralee and a six-years' course at All Hallows Missionary College,
Dublin, he was ordained to the priesthood, and left immediately for
Australia, arriving in Melbourne in Jan. 1859. He was soon
appointed to the important pastorate of St. Francis' Church,
Lonsdale Street, in that city, but, owing to failing health, took
charge of the less onerous parish of Keilor. There he remained
until 1865, when Archdeacon Shiel having been appointed Bishop of
Adelaide, Dr. Moore succeeded him as head of the Ballarat Mission
in Victoria, being appointed dean, and accompanying Archbishop
Goold to Rome in 1873, when Pius IX. made him D.D. On the erection
of Ballarat into a separate diocese he was appointed Vicar-General,
and on the death of Bishop O'Connor, in 1883, the Pope, who had
made him one of his domestic prelates and a monsignor in 1881,
first named him administrator of the diocese, and then nominated
him to the succession. He was consecrated on April 27th, 1884.</p>

C. Williamson), whose name is a household word in theatrical
Australasia, was born in San Francisco, and, like so many eminent
actresses, began her professional career in childhood. After making
her name as a local favourite, the young actress married Mr. J. C.
Williamson, then, like herself, a member of the company of the
California theatre. On August 1st, 1874, Mr. and Mrs. Williamson
arrived in Melbourne, and achieved phenomenal success with a play
entitled "Struck Oil," in which the talented pair fairly divided
the honours. At a bound they jumped into the positions of
established favourites, and have ever since maintained their hold
on the playgoing public of Australia and New Zealand. After her
husband became one of the partners in the great theatrical "Trio,"
both Mr. and Mrs. Williamson continued to act in the leading
Australian theatres. Of Maggie Moore herself it needs only to
record that she has sustained with unflagging vivacity not only the
farcical and eccentric dramatic rôles for which her early
training specially fitted her, but by her perseverance, added to
native genius, has from time to time appeared in the long series of
Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's comic operas, in which she has both sung
the music and acted the chief parts with unvarying success.</p>

Minister of Lands and Works in the Kennerley Ministry
from August 1873 to July 1876, and Colonial Secretary in
the Fysh and Giblin Governments from August
1877 to March 1878. From Oct. 1879 to August 1884 he held the same

<p><a name="A976" id="A976"></a><b>Moorhouse, Right Rev. James</b>,
D.D., Bishop of Manchester, son of James Moorhouse, merchant, of
Sheffield, by Jane Frances, his wife, daughter of Capt. Bowman, of
Whitehaven, Cumberland, was born at Sheffield on Nov. 19th, 1826.
He was educated at St. John's College, Cambridge, where he
graduated B.A. (Senior Optime) in 1853, M.A. in 1860, and
D.D. jure dignitatis in 1876. Bishop Moorhouse married on
Sept. 18th, 1861, Mary Lydia, eldest daughter of the late Rev. Dr.
Sale, vicar of Sheffield. He was ordained deacon by the Bishop of
Ely in 1853, priest in 1854; he was curate of St. Neots 1853-5,
Sheffield 1855-9, Hornsey 1859-61, perpetual curate St. John's,
Fitzroy Square, London,1861-7; Hulsean Lecturer at Cambridge 1865;
vicar of Paddington and rural dean 1867-76; Warburtonian Lecturer
and Chaplain-in-Ordinary to the Queen 1874; prebendary of St.
Paul's 1874-6. In 1876 he resigned the vicarage of Paddington
on being appointed Bishop of Melbourne in succession to Dr.
Perry. From the first he established himself in Melbourne in the
favourable opinion of his laity as well as of his clergy, and in an
incredibly short time was recognised outside the pale of the Church
as one of the very foremost public men in Australasia. A very
characteristic story is told of the Bishop, which reveals the
secret of his success in the colonies. Before starting for
Melbourne, an ex-Governor told him that in Victoria he must expect
every man to consider himself as his equal, if not his superior.
"If that be so," said the Bishop, "I shall meet with a great many
men of the same opinion as myself." Broad-minded in his theology,
Dr. Moorhouse evinced a warm interest in all matters of public
concern. The cause of Irrigation owes much to his initiatory
advocacy, whilst his pronouncements on such subjects as "Imperial
Federation" influenced public sentiment in Victoria in a remarkable
degree. Even his unceasing opposition to the State School system of
Victoria in no way lessened the respect in which he was held by all
classes and creeds in the colony, or even diminished his mere
popularity. To his efforts the erection of St. Paul's Cathedral,
Melbourne, must be mainly ascribed. In 1877 Dr. Moorhouse had the
degree of M.A. conferred on him by Melbourne University, and on the
death of Sir Redmond Barry he was elected Chancellor, a
post which he filled with much éclat until his departure
from the colony. In 1886, after the death of Dr. Fraser, he was
appointed by Lord Salisbury to the bishopric of Manchester, and
shortly afterwards took his seat as a spiritual peer in the House
of Lords. It is a further testimony to his high qualifications and
recognised ability, that, when the archbishopric of York became
vacant, first by the death of Dr. Thomson and then by that of Dr.
Magee, many of the leading journals, secular and religious, singled
out Dr. Moorhouse as one of the fittest men in the whole Anglican
Church to succeed to the Northern Archiepiscopate. Dr. Moorhouse is
the author of "Nature and Revelation," four sermons preached before
the University of Cambridge, 1861; "Our Lord Jesus Christ the
Subject of Growth in Wisdom," being the Hulsean
Lectures for 1865; "Jacob," three sermons before the
University of Cambridge, 1870; "The Expectation of Christ,"
"Dangers of the Apostolic Age," and "The Teaching of Christ"
(1891).</p>

eldest son of William Moorhouse, of Knottingley, Yorkshire, was
born in 1825 in that county, and educated for the law. He entered
as a student at the Middle Temple in Nov. 1847, and was called to
the Bar in Nov. 1850. In the following year he emigrated to the
newly founded settlement of Canterbury, N.Z., and after trying his
fortune in Victoria, where he worked on the goldfields and as a
navvy in the construction of the Yan Yean water works, returned
thither in 1853, acting for some time as resident magistrate. He
entered the Canterbury Provincial Council, and in 1857 succeeded
Mr. Fitzgerald as Superintendent of the Province. While in this
office he conceived and carried out the idea of a tunnel connecting
the Canterbury Plains with Port Lyttelton, turning the first sod of
the Lyttelton and Christchurch Railway, which passes through it, in
July 1861. He was re-elected Superintendent in 1861, but resigned
in the following year, and was again elected in 1866. In 1870 he
was Registrar-General of Lands when the Torrens system of land
transfer was introduced into New Zealand, but resigned in 1872. He
for some time sat in the General Assembly for Christchurch, and
represented Ashley from 1879 till his death, which occurred in
Sept. 1881. He founded the Canterbury Museum whilst Superintendent
of the Province.</p>

Castletrunck Seminary, and at the Royal College, Maynooth. He was
ordained priest in 1847, and in 1848 was appointed supernumerary
priest at Booterstown, and in 1849 curate of Haddington Road, co.
Dublin. In 1856 he was appointed by the Pope Bishop of Dardania and
Vicar-Apostolic of the Eastern Districts of the Cape of Good Hope.
In 1869 he was made first Bishop of Dunedin, where he established
the New Zealand Tablet. In 1888 he stood for a seat in

Ireland, on Sept. 16th, 1830. When only twelve years of age he
accompanied to Rome his uncle, Cardinal Cullen, then Rector of the
Irish College in the Eternal City. There he remained until 1866,
successively as student, professor, and Vice-Rector of the Irish
College. He received ordination on March 19th, 1853. During the
quarter of a century that he resided in Rome, he made a special
study of the archives of the early Irish and British Churches, with
the result that he is now generally acknowledged to be amongst the
foremost living authorities in the department of antiquarian
research. His studies in this direction have borne permanent fruit
in no less than twenty publications from his pen. In 1866 he
returned to Ireland in the capacity of private secretary to his
uncle, Cardinal Cullen, now promoted to the archbishopric of
Dublin. He also became Professor of Hebrew and Scripture in
Clonliffe College, Dublin. In 1872 he was consecrated Bishop of
Ossory, where he remained until March 21st, 1884, when he was
translated to the vacant archdiocese of Sydney. He arrived in
Sydney on Sept. 8th of the same year, and was welcomed by a
concourse estimated at one hundred thousand people. Next year he
was summoned to Rome, and raised to the cardinalate by Pope Leo
XIII. on July 27th. He presided at the first plenary council of the
Catholic Church in Australasia, which was attended by seventeen
prelates. It assembled in Sydney in Nov. 1885. Without being
precisely popular, Cardinal Moran is generally respected in the
colonies as an able and energetic primate. Among other works he has
published "Memoir of the Most Rev. Oliver Plunkett" (1861); "Essays
on the Origin, etc., of the Early Irish Church"; "History of the
Catholic Archbishops of Dublin" (1864); "Historical Sketch of the
persecutions, etc., under Cromwell and the Puritans" (1865); "Acta
S. Brendani" (1872); "Monasticon Hibernicum" (1873); "Spicilegium
Ossoriense, being a Collection of Documents to illustrate the
History of the Irish Church from the Reformation to the Year 1800"
(3 vols., 4to, 1879); a volume of poems entitled "Fragmentary
Thoughts"; also a political work on "The Federal Government of
Australasia," and "Letters on the Anglican Reformation" (1890).</p>

was returned for Mitchell in 1871, and two years later started
business in Brisbane, and is now the head of the well-known firm of

Council, and was Postmaster-General and Leader of the Upper House
in the McIlwraith Administration from Dec. 1880 to August 1883,
when he resigned. Mr. Morehead, who has represented Balonne in the
Assembly since 1883, accompanied Sir Arthur Palmer to Sydney to
represent Queensland at the Intercolonial Conference in 1881. He
led the opposition in the Lower House during Sir Thomas
McIlwraith's retirement from politics from 1883 to 1888, and on the
return to power of the latter after the general election in that
year, he accepted office under him as Colonial Secretary. In Nov.
1888 Sir Thomas McIlwraith resigned the Premiership through
ill-health, and Mr. Morehead succeeded him as head of the Ministry,
taking the offices of Chief Secretary and Colonial Secretary. In
Sept. 1889, on Sir Thomas McIlwraith's complete withdrawal from the
Ministry, Mr. Morehead also succeeded him as Vice-President of the
Executive Council In August 1890 Mr. Morehead resigned office with

June 21st, 1837. He spent his boyhood in Bathurst, and commenced
life as a digger by joining with his uncle, Mr. John Woodward, who
made the discovery which led to the Orphir rush, in 1851.
After working with success there and at Golden Point and Golden
Valley, he migrated to Warwick, Qd., in 1866, and engaged in mining
at Thanes' Creek, and tinning at Stanthorpe, and was successful. He
reached Rockhampton in Dec. 1879, and, after some prospecting,
opened the Gallawa reef, near Mount Wheeler, and worked it for some
years. He was then joined by his brothers&mdash;Thomas Squire
Morgan, and Edwin Francis Morgan&mdash;and with them formed a
prospecting party, which resulted in the discovery of Mount
Morgan&mdash;the richest gold mine in the world. Mr. Morgan, who is
largely interested in pastoral properties, is an Alderman of
Rockhampton, and is prominently identified with local affairs in
that town.</p>

<p><a name="A983" id="A983"></a><b>Morgan, Hon. Sir William</b>,
K.C.M.G., M.L.C., sometime Premier of South Australia, was a native
of England, and emigrated to South Australia, where he arrived in
Feb. 1849. He engaged in mercantile and pastoral pursuits, and was
elected to the Legislative Council in 1867, and remained a member
of the Upper House throughout his political career. He was Chief
Secretary in Mr. (afterwards Judge) Boucaut's Ministry from June
1875 to March 1876, and took a leading part in giving effect to the
public works policy associated with the latter gentleman's name.
His retirement from the Boucaut Ministry, with a view of devoting
himself to his private affairs, was one of the causes which
necessitated the reconstruction of the Government. In Oct. 1877 Mr.
Morgan again joined Mr. Boucaut as Chief Secretary, and held office
under his premiership until Sept. 1878, when Mr. Boucaut accepted a
seat on the Bench, and Mr. Morgan himself became head of the
Government, holding office until March 1881, when a number of
changes were made in the personnel of the Cabinet, which
in its new shape only lasted till June 1881. Subsequently Mr.
Morgan, who was created K.C.M.G., re-visited England, where he died
in 1883. Sir William married, in 1854, Harriett, daughter of Thomas
Matthews, of Hard's Hill, Coromandel Valley, S.A., who resides in
Adelaide.</p>

<p><a name="A984" id="A984"></a><b>Morgan, William Pritchard</b>,
M.P., was born in 1844, and having been admitted a solicitor,
practised at Newport, Monmouthshire. He emigrated to Queensland in
1867, and practised his profession in the north, where he gained a
reputation as a mining lawyer. He also became largely interested in
mining ventures in North Queensland. In 1885 he returned to England
and established the mercantile firm of W. Pritchard Morgan &amp;
Co. in Queen Victoria Street, London. Subsequently, when the New
South Wales contingent was offered for service in the Soudan, Mr.
Morgan volunteered a handsome subscription towards sending a
Queensland contingent to take part with the British forces in the
campaign, Mr. Morgan now turned his attention to the mining
industry in Wales, and having discovered gold in apparently payable
quantities at Dolgelly, formed a company to work the auriferous
deposits. In Oct. 1888 a vacancy occurred in the representation of
Merthyr Tydvil in the House of Commons. Mr. Morgan thereupon became
a candidate in the independent Liberal interest, and was returned
by a very large majority over the official Liberal nominee. Both in
and out of Parliament, Mr. Morgan has conducted a vigorous
crusade against the antiquated system of gold mining royalties by
which in England the working of auriferous deposits is hampered and
strangled, Very considerable concessions have in consequence been
wrung from the Government, though Mr. Morgan himself has been
heavily mulcted by the exactions of the Treasury in his plucky
attempt to exploit the auriferous resources or his native Wales. In
1891 Mr. Morgan took up the question of Welsh disestablishment, and
made a very able and exhaustive speech in bringing the subject
under the notice of the House of Commons. He also intervened with
the weight of local knowledge in the discussion on the proposed
renewal of the importation of Kanaka labourers into Queensland,
defending the policy of the Griffith Government At the general
election in July 1892 Mr. Morgan was again returned for
Merthyr.</p>

arriving at Kangaroo Island in Sept. 1836. The next year when the
Company removed their headquarters to Port Adelaide, Mr. Morphett
also took up his residence on the mainland. In June 1843 he was
appointed one of the seven members of the first Legislative Council
of South Australia, and in 1851 he was nominated to the mixed
council established under the new Constitution Act. He was also
chosen Speaker. In 1857, at the first election held under
responsible government, he was returned to the existing Legislative
Council, and in March 1865 succeeded Sir J. H. Fisher as
President of that body, a post which, having been thrice
re-elected, he held till Feb. 1875, when his seat becoming vacant
by effluxion of time, he did not seek re-election. He was knighted

Captain (afterwards Admiral Sir John) Hindmarsh, to South
Australia, being present when the colony was proclaimed on Dec.
28th, 1836. After being engaged in pastoral pursuits at
Encounter Bay and Guichen Bay, Mr. Morris went to the Californian
diggings in 1850, but returned to South Australia three years
later, when he was shortly afterwards appointed a Government Sheep
Inspector, and subsequently Chief Inspector. During his thirteen
years' tenure of the latter post he eradicated scab. He also made a
valuation for the Government of all runs under lease. In 1865 Mr.
Morris became manager of the late Mr. F. H. Dutton's Anlaby
station.</p>

<p><a name="A989" id="A989"></a><b>Mort, Thomas Sutcliffe</b>, one
of the leading commercial pioneers and public benefactors of New
South Wales, was born at Bolton, in Lancashire, on Dec. 23rd, 1816.
He entered the warehouse of the eminent Manchester firm of A. &amp;
S. Henry as a youth, and was recommended by them to the firm of
Aspinwall, Brown &amp; Co., carrying on business in Sydney, whither
he proceeded in 1838. Mr. Mort remained with this firm and their
successors, Gosling, Brown &amp; Co., till 1843, when the latter
firm collapsed in the financial crisis, and Mr. Mort started in
business as an auctioneer on his own account. In this way the great
wool-broking and financial firm of Mort &amp; Co. was founded, Mr.
Mort being the first to initiate public wool sales in Australia.
Amongst numerous public enterprises which he was prominent in
promoting were the Hunter River Steam Navigation Company (1841);
the Sydney to Parramatta Railway (the first constructed in the
colony&mdash;1849); the Great Nugget Vein Mining Company (the first
company started for the working of auriferous lands); and Mort's
Dock and Engineering Company, Limited, in which last he invested
nearly £100,000. In 1856 he started a dairying settlement at
Bodalla, in the Moruya district of New South Wales, which soon
occupied an area of 38,000 acres, and gave profitable occupation to
a large number of persons, the capital invested by Mr. Mort being
computed at £100,000. In 1862 and 1863 Mr. Mort took an active part
in floating the famous Peak Downs Copper Company in Queensland, and
the Waratah Coal Mining Company, which carries on operations at
Newcastle, N.S.W., both having proved enormously profitable. Mr.
Mort also assisted in establishing a Maizena factory and iceworks.
The great public work of his life was, however, in connection with
the frozen meat industry. As early as 1843 he had gone into the
export of beef cured in the ordinary way. In conjunction with Mr.
E. D. Nicolle&mdash;who provided the science, and Mr. Mort the
capital&mdash;he now went into a series of elaborate experiments to
test the practicability of conveying the produce of Australian
pastures to the European meat markets in a fresh condition.
Hackneyed as the freezing process as applied to meat preservation
now appears, it had all the interest and excitement of novelty when
Mr. Mort first turned his attention to its possible developments.
The first thing was to secure a cheap means of freezing, and this
was accomplished when the repeated use of the same ammonia was
demonstrated to be feasible. Partial freezing, it was found, would
not do, as the meat went bad so quickly when exposed; whilst, on
the other hand, when thoroughly frozen, it was found to keep longer
after thawing than fresh meat after being killed. Mr. Mort also
convinced himself that the quality of the meat was not deteriorated
by being frozen. Freezing works were erected at Darling Harbour,
and slaughterhouses in the Lithgow valley, amongst the Blue
Mountains, on the Great Western line of railway ninety-six miles,
so as to save travelling the cattle over the mountains, which
injured their quality. At a luncheon given at the freezing works on
Sept 2nd, 1875, to inaugurate the start of the industry, Mr. Mort
spoke of having solved the riddle by which the superabundance of
one country should supply the deficiency of another. He had spent
£80,000 upon the venture, and £20,000 in addition was subscribed by
the squatters of Australia, with the view of sending home a trial
shipment, the ship Northern being chartered for the
purpose. Unfortunately Mr. Nicolle's inventive skill failed him at
the last moment, the machinery proving unable to stand the action
of the chemical agent employed. This failure at the moment of
seeming fruition was a terrible blow to Mr. Mort, who could not
foresee the splendid results of which his efforts and those of Mr.
Nicolle had laid the foundation. The meat export was abandoned, and
the freezing works converted to local use as an ice
manufactory, a daily supply of fresh milk and a depôt of cooked
dishes being started in connection therewith in the interests of
the Sydney working classes. Mr. Mort died at Bodalla on May 9th,
1878, a monument being erected to his memory by public
subscription. Mr. Mort married first, in 1841, Theresa Shepheard,
eldest daughter of James Laidley, of Sydney, sometime Deputy
Commissary-General (who died in 1869); and, secondly, Miss
Macaulay. The firm of Mort &amp; Co. was recently amalgamated with
the equally eminent firm of R. Goldsbrough &amp; Co., Limited,
under the style of Goldsbrough, Mort &amp; Co., Limited.</p>

<p><a name="A990" id="A990"></a><b>Moss, Frederick Joseph</b>, was
born at St. Helena in 1829. From St. Helena he went to Cape Colony,
where he was trained to business in a merchant's office, and later
on served as a burgher in the Kaffir war. In 1859 he emigrated to
New Zealand, landing in Canterbury, where he at once organised and
became captain of No. 3 Company of Volunteers, and took an active
interest in supporting the construction of the tunnel which
connects Christchurch with the port of Lyttelton. On the discovery
of gold in Otago, he removed to Dunedin, where he entered into
business and again took an Interest in volunteering, being elected
captain of the first company there organised. In 1862 he was
elected a member of the Otago Provincial Council, and shortly
afterwards accepted the office of Provincial Treasurer, retaining
that position till 1866, when he was succeeded by Mr. (now Sir
Julius) Vogel, whose policy, local or general, he has always
consistently and unflinchingly opposed. In 1868 Mr. Moss went to
Fiji and established himself as a planter on the Rewa River, but
finding the climate injurious to his health, he returned to New
Zealand and settled at Auckland, where he was elected a member of
the House of Representatives for Parnell in 1876, and sat
continuously for that borough until 1890, when he was appointed
British Resident at Rarotonga, a position which he still holds. In
1888 Mr. Moss made a seven months' cruise on a schooner through the
South Sea Islands, and published an account of his trip in a volume
entitled "Through Atolls and Islands in the Great South Sea"
(Sampson Low, Marston, Searle &amp; Rivington, 1889). He is also
the author of a "School History of New Zealand" (Brett, Auckland,

He arrived in South Australia with his parents in Oct. 1850. He is
a legal practitioner in Adelaide, and represents the Albert
district in the Legislative Assembly of South Australia. He was
appointed Attorney-General in the Cockburn Ministry in
June 1889, but retired in March 1890, prior to the defeat of the

Mueller, of Rostock, Germany, and Louisa his wife, daughter of
George Mertens, of Aschersleben, was born at Rostock in 1825, and
was educated, after the early death of his parents, in Schleswig.
He studied in Kiel, and devoted much time to the study of the flora
of Schleswig and Holstein from 1840 to 1847, when he emigrated to
Australia. He travelled through the extensive territory of South
Australia, employed in botanical researches, from 1848 till 1852,
at his private expense. In 1852 he accepted the then newly created
office of Government Botanist for Victoria, explored there till
1855, examining also the whole alpine vegetation of Australia,
which was previously utterly unknown; he ascended and named Mount
Hotham, the Barkly ranges, and many other mountains, and joined as
phytographic naturalist the expedition sent out under Augustus
Gregory, by the Duke of Newcastle, to explore the river Victoria
and other portions of the north parts of the Australian continent.
He was one of the four who reached Termination Lake in 1856, and
accompanied Gregory's expedition overland to Moreton Bay. He
accepted the directorship of the Botanical Gardens of Melbourne in
1857, which office he held till 1873, raising that institution to
high repute and establishing scientific relations with all parts of
the globe, in order to introduce useful and rare plants into the
colony, and to make known Australian plants abroad. He was one
of the Commissioners for the Industrial Exhibitions in Melbourne in
1854, 1862, and 1867; and has issued eleven volumes of his
"Fragmenta Phytographica Australiæ," two volumes on the "Plants of
Victoria," and others on the Eucalyptus, Myoporinæ, Acacias, and
Salsolaceæ, all largely illustrated, irrespective of many other
publications. He co-operated in the elaboration of Bentham's "Flora
Australiensis," of which seven volumes have appeared. He was
elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1861, and is a
member of numerous foreign orders, besides being created a
hereditary baron by the King of Wurtemberg in 1871. He has
persistently and effectually promoted geographic research in
Australian territory. The Baron still continues his researches in
Melbourne. In 1879 he had conferred on him the Knight Commandership
of the Order of St. Michael and St. George, of which he had been
appointed a Companion in 1869. In 1888 he was the recipient of one
of the royal medals of the Royal Society of London. The Baron is
corresponding member of over a hundred and fifty scientific
societies, including many academies in various parts of the

born at Glen Dubh, in Sutherlandshire, on Jan. 7th, 1832, and
educated at the Armadale School Mr. Munro began life as a printer
and going to Edinburgh in 1848, entered the establishment of Thomas
Constable &amp; Co., printers to the Queen. He left Edinburgh for
Victoria in the Champion of the Seas in 1858, and
returned his attention to printing, but left that occupation in
1865, to found and conduct the Victoria Permanent Property
Investment and Building Society. Mr. Munro also started the
Melbourne Woollen Mill and the Victorian Permanent Fire Insurance
Company. After seven years' service as secretary of the named
society, he started the Federal Banking Company in 1882, and
conducted its operations as managing director for three years. The
Real Estate Bank was founded by him in 1887. Mr. Munro stood for
Parliament in 1863 for Dundas, but was unsuccessful. In 1874 he was
returned for North Melbourne as a supporter of the late Mr.
Francis, and in May 1877 became first member for Carlton. He was,
however, defeated in 1880, but re-entered the Assembly as member
for North Melbourne in 1881. In 1883 he did not stand, but in 1886
he was elected for Geelong, in succession to Sir Graham Berry.
Mr. Munro was Minister of Education in the first Berry Ministry
from August 7th to Oct 20th, 1875, being sworn of the Executive
Council on the former date. He declined office in the second Berry
Ministry in 1877, and joined with Mr. Casey in forming a "corner
party" on the Liberal side. Mr. Munro is President of the Victorian
Alliance and the Melbourne Total Abstinence Society, and was the
acknowledged leader of the Temperance party in the Victorian
Parliament for a good many years. Mr. Munro, who led the opposition
to the Gillies-Deakin Government, visited England in
1890, and successfully carried through several important commercial
operations, besides being warmly received by the prominent
advocates of temperance in Great Britain. On his return to the
colony, Mr. Munro attacked the financial policy of the Gillies
Government with great trenchancy, and ultimately carried a direct
vote of want of confidence in them by a large majority. He then
himself became Premier (Nov. 4th, 1890) at the head of what he
styled a "National Liberal" Ministry. He was one of the
representatives of Victoria at the Federation Convention held
in Sydney in March 1891. In Feb. 1892 Mr. Munro resigned the
premiership to Mr. Shiels, having accepted the post of
Agent-General for Victoria in London, in succession to Sir Graham
Berry. He arrived in London in April 1892, and assumed the duties
of his present office on the 13th of that month.</p>

individual score of 321 runs. From 1875 to 1884 he a played in
eleven intercolonial matches, and in twenty innings, without once
carrying out his bat, secured the magnificent average of 46.85. He
is regarded as the W. G. Grace of Australia, and at one
time was a fine wicket-keeper, but later on he generally fielded at
point. He has four times captained representative Australian
elevens in England, namely, in 1880, 1882, 1884, and 1890. Mr.

erected Vicariate Apostolic of Hyderabad, Deccan, India. During the
Mutiny in 1857 he manifested great prudence, and secured from the
Nizam several stands of arms for the boys of the Catholic College,
who were drilled in expectation of a mutiny arising in the State.
In consequence of failing health, Pope Pius IX. transferred him
from India to Tasmania in 1865, appointing him Bishop of Hobart in
succession to the late Dr. Willson. He arrived at Hobart in April
1866. He attended the Ecumenical Council at the Vatican in 1869,
and paid another visit to Rome from Hobart in 1882. In 1888, on the
occasion of the golden jubilee of his priesthood, Hobart was
erected into an archbishopric, and he became the first

at Trinity College, Dublin, as a medical student, ultimately being
admitted M.R.C.S. of London. In June 1836 Dr. Murphy emigrated to
Sydney, N.S.W., and was immediately nominated by the Governor (Sir
R. Bourke) to a position on the staff of colonial surgeons. On
appointment he proceeded to take charge of a portion of the
southern district in the county of Argyle, but soon afterwards
being led into agricultural pursuits, he resigned his official
position, and finally discontinued practice as a medical man. After
leaving the Government service, Dr. Murphy purchased a considerable
quantity of land at Argyle, and soon became the largest
grain-grower in the district. He married in 1840 Agnes, eldest
daughter of Lieutenant David Reid, R.N., of Inverary Park, N.S.W.,
and in 1847 went to Victoria, where he purchased a station on the
Ovens river, in the Beechworth district. Dr. Murphy was returned to
the partially elective Legislative Council for the Murray district
at the first election which took place after the separation of
Victoria from New South Wales. He was for some time Chairman of
Committees, and in 1852 he sold his pastoral property and went to
reside permanently in Melbourne. In 1853 he was re-elected for the
Murray, and resigned the chairmanship of committees to become
President of the Central Road Board, which latter position he
relinquished in Nov. 1856. He was acting Speaker in the
Assembly daring the absence, on account of illness, of Dr.
(afterwards Sir J. F.) Palmer in March 1855. When responsible
government was conceded, he was elected to the first Legislative
Assembly of Victoria for the Murray, and appointed the first
Speaker of the House in Oct. 1856. To this post he was re-elected
in 1859, 1861, 1864, 1866, and 1868, and held it continuously till
the dissolution of Parliament on Jan. 24th, 1871, when he resigned,
having in the meantime been knighted in 1860. In 1866 Sir Francis
Murphy left the Murray and was returned for the Grenville
electorate till 1871, when he was defeated, and was out of
Parliament till the next year, when he entered the Upper House as
member for the Eastern Province. He resigned his seat in council in
1876, and resided for some time in England. He died on March 30th,

in that town, and at St. Patrick's, Maynooth. At the latter College
he was for some time Prefect of Studies, and was ordained in 1826.
The scene of his early pastoral labours was at Bradford, in
Yorkshire, and at Liverpool, but in 1838 he went on mission duty to
New South Wales, succeeding the late Bishop Ullathorne as
Vicar-General of the diocese of Sydney. When the suffragan sees of
Adelaide, Perth and Hobart were constituted, in 1842, Father Murphy
was appointed the first Bishop of the capital of South Australia,
and was consecrated in Sydney in Sept. 1844, this being the first
occasion on which the ceremony was performed in Australia. He
assumed his episcopal functions at Adelaide in Nov. 1884, and
consecrated St. Mary's, Morphett Vale&mdash;the first Roman
Catholic church erected in South Australia&mdash;successfully
superintending the early development of the various ecclesiastical
institutions which have since multiplied so enormously. He died in
Adelaide on April 26th, 1858.</p>

Originally intended for the priesthood, he was apprenticed to his
uncle at Liverpool, to the trade of cabinet-maker. In 1860 he
volunteered as one of "O'Reilly's Brigade" for the defence of Pius
IX., and landed at Civita Vecchia, but with the other Irish
volunteers was soon shipped back to Ireland. Returning to
Liverpool, Mr. Murphy finished his apprenticeship and displayed his

<p><a name="A1012" id="A1012"></a><b>Neild, James Edward</b>,
L.S.A.(Lond.), M.D., Ch.M. (Melb.), the well-known dramatic critic,
was born at Doncaster, in Yorkshire, in 1824, and is descended from
an Irish family who emigrated into England in 1642. He received his
early education in Leeds, and in 1843 he went to Sheffield to his
uncle, a surgeon in extensive practice there, to whom he was
apprenticed for five years. Subsequently he completed his medical
studies at University College, London. He passed his examination in
1848, and for two years was in practice at Oulton, near Leeds. He
was then for three years house surgeon of the Rochdale General
Dispensary. In 1853 he went to Victoria on a visit, but ultimately
decided to stay in Melbourne, where he abandoned his profession and
started business as a chemist and druggist. In 1855, having always
had a desire for newspaper work, he became a reporter on the
Melbourne <i>Age</i>, then only just started. After ceasing regular
connection with the <i>Age</i>, he contributed a good many
occasional theatrical notices to that paper. In 1856 the late Mr.
T. L. Bright started "My Notebook," and engaged Dr. Neild to write
the theatrical notices. This having dropped, the proprietors of the
<i>Argus</i> issued the <i>Examiner</i> in 1857, with Mr. T. L.
Bright as its first editor, and for upwards of two years Dr. Neild
wrote the theatrical criticisms under the signature of "Christopher
Sly." Ultimately the <i>Examiner</i>, the <i>Yeoman</i>, and the
<i>Weekly Argus</i> were blended into one, under the title of the
<i>Australasian</i>, in which Dr. Neild continued to do the
theatrical criticism under the signature of "Jaques," and in more
recent times under the <i>nom de plume</i> of "Tahite." His
connection with the <i>Argus</i>, which belongs to the same
proprietary as the <i>Australasian</i>, commenced in 1858, and he
also contributed to Melbourne <i>Punch</i> and other papers. In
1864 he retired from the business as a chemist which he had carried
on meanwhile, and resumed the practice of his profession. Almost
coincidently he accepted the editorship of the <i>Australian
Medical Journal</i>, and began to take an active part as a member
of the Medical Society of Victoria, of which in 1868 he was elected
president, and of which he was subsequently honorary secretary. In
1864 he took the degree of M.D. in the University of Melbourne, and
the following year was appointed lecturer on forensic medicine. Dr.
Neild is the author of several novelettes, and has had two
comediettas successfully placed upon the stage. He married in 1857
the eldest daughter of Mr. D. R. Long.</p>

B.A. (second class Natural Science Tripos) in 1865, and M.A. in
1868, being created D.D. in 1871. He was ordained deacon in 1860
and priest in 1861. From 1860 to 1862 he was curate of Scarisbrick,
Lancashire, and rector of Shelton, Staffordshire, from the latter
year till 1871, when he accepted the bishopric of Dunedin. He was
consecrated in the pro-cathedral, Dunedin, by the Primate (Harper)
of Dunedin and Bishops Suter of Nelson, Hadfield of Wellington, and
Williams of Waiapu. Dr. Nevill has twice since revisited England to
attend the Lambeth Conferences. He was married at Heavitree, Devon,
in 1863, to Miss M. S. C. Penny. When rector of Shelton the Bishop
held a certificate of the Science and Art Department of South
Kensington qualifying him to instruct candidates for examination
under the Department, and was thus instrumental in laying the
foundation of the career of some who have attained positions of
eminence. The branch of the Nevill family to which the Bishop
belongs had been for many generations settled in Suffolk, but the
Bishop's great-grandfather having assisted Count Zinzendorf in the

knighted by patent in March 1852, and took great interest in the
advancement of education. He was appointed first Vice-Provost of
Sydney University, and delivered an inaugural address at its
opening in Oct. 1852. In 1854 he was chosen first Chancellor of the
University, and has been one of its most liberal benefactors. In
1857 he was made an honorary D.C.L. of the University of Oxford,
and was created first baronet of Luddenham, N.S.W., in April 1859,
In the following year Queensland was constituted a separate colony,
and Sir Charles Nicholson having been nominated to the Legislative

<p><a name="A1021" id="A1021"></a><b>Nicholson, Hon. William</b>,
the "father of the Australian ballot," was a native of Cumberland,
and arrived in Melbourne in 1842, where he went into business, and
was Mayor in 1850. He entered the old partially elective
Legislative Council of Victoria as member for North Bourke very
shortly after the separation of the colony from New South Wales. In
1852 he supported Mr. J. S. Johnston's motion of want of confidence
in Governor Latrobe, and in Sept. 1853 he was appointed one of the
Select Committee to whom was entrusted the task of drafting an
autonomous constitution for Victoria. Mr. Nicholson's name will be
best remembered in connection with the introduction of the ballot
into the electoral system of Victoria, whence it spread to the
other colonies, and has since been widely adopted elsewhere. It was
in 1855 that the subject cropped up, when the Legislative Council
was considering the bill by which the electoral system under the
fully elected bicameral Legislature inaugurated in the next year
was to be regulated. On the Electoral Bill being set down for a
second reading, Mr. Nicholson moved as an amendment "That, in the
opinion of this House, any new electoral act should provide for
electors recording their votes by secret ballot." On Dec. 19th his
amendment was carried by 33 votes to 23, Mr. Childers, Sir John
O'Shanassy, Mr. J. P. Fawkner, and Dr. Greeves being in the
minority, with Mr. Haines, the Premier, and the other members of
the Government. The next day the Ministry resigned, and the Council
was adjourned to Jan. 8th, 1856. In the meantime (Dec. 21st, 1855)
the Governor, Sir Charles Hotham, sent for Mr. Nicholson, who at
the time was on the eve of paying a visit to the old country.
Ultimately, however, he decided to abandon his trip and to take
office as Premier and Chief Secretary; but he found some difficulty
in filling up the other portfolios. This caused delay, and in the
meantime the Governor, to whom he had notified his ill-success,
died. Major-General Macarthur then became the administrator of the
government, and on New Year's Day, 1856, sent for Mr. Nicholson,
and asked if he might consider himself at liberty to recall Mr.
Haines, the displaced Premier. Mr. Nicholson left the matter
entirely in the ex-Governor's hands, with the result that the old
Government came back to office. On Jan. 8th Mr. Nicholson explained
the causes of his ill-success to the Council, and asked Mr. Haines
to leave the ballot an open question in the restored Cabinet. This
he was ultimately forced to do, and Mr. Nicholson carried the
clauses establishing the present form of what is known as the
"Australian ballot" in committee on the Electoral Bill. As this is
a matter of considerable political interest, it may be stated that
to Mr. H. S. Chapman (<i>q.v.</i>) Mr. Nicholson was indebted for
the idea of having the names of all the candidates printed and
letting the voter strike out the names of those for whom he did not
wish to vote. Mr. Nicholson's own plan was much more rudimentary,
as he simply proposed to give each voter a blank card on which he
was to write the names of the candidate or candidates he desired to
support. Ultimately he adopted the clauses drafted for him by Mr.
Chapman, and was the instrument of their being incorporated in
Victorian statute law. Against Mr. Nicholson's protest, an
additional clause was inserted for numbering the ballot papers and
thus preventing their being tampered with. On May 23rd, 1856, Mr.
Nicholson, who, though not the author, may be styled the father, of
the Australian ballot, carried out his original intention of
revisiting England, and was not therefore a candidate for a seat in
Parliament at the first election under responsible government. He
remained in England two years, and during his stay in London was
fêted as the hero of the Victorian ballot. Of this John Stuart Mill
wrote to his friend H. S. Chapman as follows in 1858: "The adoption
of the ballot in Victoria has made some noise here, and has been a
good deal appealed to by its advocates in Parliament. You have
heard, no doubt, of the dinner given to Nicholson. It will perhaps
surprise you that I am not now a supporter of the ballot, though I
am far from thinking I was wrong in supporting it formerly." Mr.
Nicholson returned to Victoria in 1858, and in August 1859 was
returned to the Legislative Assembly for Sandridge. The following
Oct. he turned out the O'Shanassy Ministry on a vote of want of
confidence, and became Premier and Chief Secretary of Victoria
himself, only, however, to be displaced by Mr. Heales in Nov. 1860.
In the meantime he had passed a land bill authorising any person to
select to the extent of six hundred and forty acres, at a minimum
price of £1 per acre. Selection was to be after survey, but the
Government were enjoined to survey within twelve months, and land
was to be thrown open to the extent of three million acres in the
proclaimed districts. The bill was a good deal emasculated by the
Legislative Council, and two of his best colleagues, Messrs.
Francis and Service, resigned office in Sept. 1860, thus preparing
the way for the downfall of the Ministry in November. Not long
afterwards Mr. Nicholson retired from politics, and died in 1870.
He was one of the founders of the Bank of Victoria.</p>

<p><a name="A1022" id="A1022"></a><b>Nickle, Major-General Sir

was the son of an officer in the 17th Light Dragoons, and entered
the army at an early age. He served with the well-known Connaught
Rangers in various parts of the world for upwards of twenty-two
years, seeing much hard service and winning great distinction for
bravery. He went to the West Indies in 1830, and was appointed
Governor of St. Christopher and its dependencies. He served during
the insurrection in British North America in 1838, and was knighted
in 1844. In 1853 he was appointed commander of the forces in
Australia, and during the riots at the gold diggings in 1854
displayed great forbearance and tact. Coming on the scene shortly
after the affair of the Eureka stockade, where Captain Thomas was
in command of the Queen's troops, he induced the rioters to
disperse without further bloodshed. He was nearly seventy years of

subsequently mayor, and which he represented in the Assembly from
1877 to 1889, when he was returned for Albert Park. Mr. Nimmo, who
is a moderate Liberal and Protectionist, and a strong advocate of
temperance, was Commissioner of Public Works in the Gillies
Government from Feb. 1886 to June 1889, when he resigned. He was
for some time representative of the Government on the Melbourne

<p><a name="A1024" id="A1024"></a><b>Nisbet, Hume</b>, artist and
author, was born on August 8th, 1849, at Stirling, Scotland. As a
boy he received special artistic training, and was educated under
the Rev. Dr. Culross (now of Bristol College) up to the age of
fifteen, when he left Scotland and emigrated to Melbourne, Vict.
The next seven years he spent in wandering over the Australian
colonies, Tasmania, New Zealand, and the South Sea Islands,
painting and sketching and writing poetry and stories, besides
making notes for future work. Of this period he spent one year
acquiring theatrical experience at the Theatre Royal, Melbourne,
under the well-known actor Mr. Richard Stewart. He returned to
London in 1872, and spent some time in studying and copying
pictures in the National Gallery and at South Kensington. At the
end of the next year he went back to Scotland, and devoted himself
to art, with an occasional lapse into literature. For eight years
he was art master of the Watt Institution and School of Art,
Edinburgh. He again went to reside in London, and in 1884 revisited
Australia, and made his way to New Guinea, where he was the first
painter-author to "interview" the Papuans. Most of his pictures
have found a location in Scotland, and in 1883 he had an exhibition
in Edinburgh of his collected works. He got to loggerheads with the
Royal Scottish Academy, whose methods he criticised in numerous
pamphlets and articles. During this trying period he owed much to
the kindly encouragement of Mr. John Buskin and Sir Noel Paton.
Among his best-known paintings are "Eve's first Moonrise," "The
Flying Dutchman," "The Dream of Sardanapalus," four pictures of
"The Ancient Mariner," and "The Battle of Dunbar." His literary
efforts are mainly inspired by his Australian and South Sea
experiences. He has published "The Practical in Painting"
(Edinburgh, 1880), "Life and Nature Studies" (London, 1887), "The
Land of the Hibiscus Blossom" (London, 1888), "Dr. Bernard St.
Vincent" (London, 1889), "Eight Bells" (ditto), "Memories of the
Months" (ditto), "Ashes" (London, 1890), "Bail Up" (ditto), "My
Illustrated Diary of a Voyage from London to Australia" (ditto),

<p><a name="A1035" id="A1035"></a><b>O'Connell, Hon. Sir Maurice
Charles</b>, M.L.C., sometime Speaker of the Legislative Council,
Queensland, was the son of General Sir Maurice Charles O'Connell,
formerly Lieut.-Governor and Commander of the Forces in New South
Wales, by his marriage with Mary, daughter of Admiral William
Bligh, whose name has acquired world-wide notoriety in connection
with the mutiny of the <i>Bounty</i>. He was for some years
Governor of New South Wales; and when, in 1810, he was forcibly
deposed by the officers in command of the forces in New South
Wales, Lady O'Connell (then Mrs. Putland, widow of Lieut. Putland),
courageously attempted to prevent the entrance of the insurgent
officers into Government House. Failing in this, she vainly
attempted to conceal her father, who was placed under arrest, and
subsequently deported from the colony. Sir Maurice O'Connell, who
was related to the "Liberator," was born in Sydney in 1812, and
educated at the High School, Edinburgh, and in Dublin and Paris. He
entered the army when sixteen, and joined the 73rd Regiment at
Gibraltar. When twenty-three he went to Spain as colonel of a
regiment of the British Legion which he himself had raised in the
county of Cork and other parts of Munster, to sustain the cause of
the Spanish Queen and constitution against the insurgent Carlists.
Later on he became Deputy Adjutant-General, and ultimately
succeeded Sir De Lacy Evans as general of brigade in command of the
now British Auxiliary Legion in Spain. The Legion was disbanded in
1837, Sir Maurice O'Connell being rewarded for his services by
having the knighthood of several Spanish orders conferred upon him.
On his return to England he was appointed to the 51st Regiment, and
afterwards becoming captain in the 28th, was appointed military
secretary on the staff of his father in New South Wales in 1835.
When the 28th was recalled to England, Sir Maurice sold out, and
engaged in pastoral pursuits. In 1843 he unsuccessfully contested
Sydney for a seat in the first Legislative Council of New South
Wales, but was subsequently returned for the Port Phillip district
(now Victoria). In 1848 he was appointed Commissioner of Crown
Lands for the Burnett district, and in 1854 was made Government
Resident at Port Curtis. The latter post he held till 1860, when
the Moreton Bay district, in which both the Burnett and Port Curtis
districts were situated, was separated from New South Wales, and
was converted into the colony of Queensland. Sir Maurice was at
once nominated to the Legislative Council of the latter colony, and
represented the Herbert Ministry in the Upper House as a member of
the Executive Council, without portfolio, from May to August 1860,
when he succeeded Sir Charles Nicholson as President of the
Legislative Council, and held that position till his decease. He
also held the command of the local forces, and was on four
occasions Acting Governor of Queensland. In the latter capacity he
entertained the Duke of Edinburgh at Government House, Brisbane, in
1868, in which year he was knighted. Sir Maurice, who was president
of the Australasian Association and of the Queensland Turf Club,
died on March 23rd, 1879, and was accorded the honour of a public
funeral. He married on July 23rd, 1835, Eliza Emiline, daughter of
Col. Philip Le Geyt (63rd Regiment), of Jersey, who survived
him.</p>

the "Young Ireland" movement, and joined with R. D. Williams
("Shamrock," of the Nation), in founding the <i>Irish Tribune</i>,
the first number of which was published in Dublin on June 10th,
1848. At the fifth number, issued on July 10th, the new journal was
suppressed by the Castle authorities, and Mr. O'Doherty was lodged
in gaol on a charge of treason-felony. In the following month he
was placed on his trial, but the jury disagreed, and the same fate
awaited a second experiment. Arraigned a third time, he was found
guilty, and sentenced to ten years' transportation. Van Diemen's
Land (now Tasmania) was his destined location, for which he sailed
in company with John Martin, arriving in Nov. 1849. He was at once
released on parole, and his professional services were utilised at
St. Mary's Hospital, Hobart. Five years later Mr. O'Doherty
received a pardon, conditional on his residing anywhere out of the
United Kingdom. Of this he availed himself to settle in Paris,
where be resumed his medical studies, making a secret excursion to
Dublin in order to marry Miss Kelly ("Eva," of the <i>Nation</i>),
to whom he had been affianced at the time of his trial, and who had
promised to wait for him when their prospects of reunion seemed
blackest. In 1856 Mr. O'Doherty received an unconditional pardon,
and in the following year he returned to Dublin, where he was
admitted F.R.C.S. in 1857, and L.M. and L.R.Q.C.P. in 1859. After
practising in Dublin for some time with much success, Mr. O'Doherty
emigrated to Brisbane, where he took a leading position in his
profession, and was for six years one of the members for the
capital in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. In 1877 he was
nominated a member of the Legislative Council, and retained his
seat till 1886, when he resigned, with the view of settling in
Europe. He was received with great cordiality on his return to
Ireland, and was at once nominated and returned to the House of
Commons for Meath in the Parnellite interest. After a few months,
however, he resigned his seat in Parliament, and returned to
Queensland, where he still resides. Mr. O'Doherty was for some time
president of the Irish National League of Australia, and was
chairman of the Irish Australian Convention, held in Melbourne in
1883.</p>

obtained his diploma as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons,
England, he emigrated to Tasmania, where he was appointed
Government medical officer for New Norfolk, and also acquired
considerable private practice in partnership with Dr. Agnew, who
has since been Premier of the colony. Sir Robert paid a brief visit
to Victoria whilst the gold fever was at its height; but ultimately
returned to Tasmania, where, after filling the post of Assistant
Colonial Surgeon, he retired from the medical profession, resigning
his practice to Dr. Agnew. In 1853 he was returned to the old
Legislative Council, then the only Chamber, for Buckingham. In the
following year the new Constitution Act was passed, and when the
first election under the bi-cameral system took place, in Sept.
1856, Sir Robert Officer was returned to the House of Assembly for
the district of Glenorchy. He was at once chosen Chairman of
Committees, and on the retirement of Mr. Fenton in August 1861
became Speaker of the House. This position he held uninterruptedly
until April 1877, having been four times re-elected in the
interval, and having throughout the whole term of his Speakership
been returned unopposed for Glenorchy. Sir Robert was knighted in
1869; and after his resignation of the Speakership, on which
occasion he received the thanks of the House for his long and
valuable services, he retired to live at Hall Green, his residence
near New Norfolk, where to the last he occupied himself in hop
cultivation and salmon acclimatisation, industries in which he was

South Australian Civil Service, receiving his first appointment
from Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell, the then Governor. After
passing ten years in the Audit Office, and rising to the third
position in that department, he was promoted to the clerkship of
the Executive Council, being at the same time gazetted Clerk to the
Court of Appeals. These offices he retained until 1871, and, in
addition, acted for awhile as private secretary to the Right Hon.
Sir James Fergusson, Bart., Governor of the colony. In consequence
of certain reductions in the estimates, which involved several
departmental changes, Mr. O'Halloran retired from the Government
service in 1871, with compensation for loss of office, the Governor
in Council recording his testimony to the honourable manner in
which he had discharged his duties. Soon after his retirement Mr.
O'Halloran came to England, was elected a Fellow of the Royal
Geographical Society and of the Royal Colonial Institute, and found
occupation in the city of London, where he filled secretarial
appointments for a period extending over seven years. In 1872 he
acted&mdash;in conjunction with the late Dr. C. W. Eddy&mdash;as
honorary secretary and a member of the committee for celebrating
the opening of telegraphic communication with Australia. In the
following year he proceeded to New Zealand, and travelled through
both islands, collecting information in connection with some
elaborate investigations which had been conducted in London with a
view to the application of an improved process for the extraction
of the fibre of the Phormium tenax. He visited the Cape of Good
Hope in 1877, and in the succeeding year revisited Australia. In
April 1881 he was appointed assistant-secretary and librarian of
the Royal Colonial Institute, and in Dec. 1883 was promoted to the
position of secretary. In 1882 he proceeded to North-Western
Canada, which was then attracting much attention, for the purpose
of acquainting himself with its capabilities as a field for
settlement. In 1884 he again visited Canada, attending the Montreal
meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science
as one of the secretaries to the Geographical Section, the
president of which section publicly acknowledged his services.
Before returning to England he made an extended tour through Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. In 1885 he
attended the Aberdeen meeting, again undertaking the secretaryship
of Section E. Mr. O'Halloran was a member of the London committee

became a cadet at the Royal Military College, Marlow, in 1808;
ensign Royal West Middlesex Militia in 1809; ensign 17th Foot in
1813, and joined his regiment in 1814. He served in the Nepaul war
during the years 1814, 1815, and 1816, became lieutenant in June
1817, and served in the Deccan war during that and the following
year. He married, on August 1st, 1821, Miss Ann Goss, of Dawlish,
who died in 1823 in Calcutta. In 1822 he exchanged from the 17th to
the 44th Regiment, which he joined in Calcutta in Jan. 1823. In
1824 he was ordered with the left wing of the 44th to Chittagong,
where he arrived early in June, and was appointed paymaster,
quartermaster, and interpreter. On Oct. 30th he was appointed
brigade-major to Brigadier-General Dunkin, C.B., who commanded the
Sylket division of the army during the Burmese war, and served on
his staff until his death in Nov. 1825. He received a medal for war
service in India, for Nepaul and Ava. On April 27th, 1827, he
purchased his company in the 99th Regiment, and exchanged into the
56th Regiment in 1828. In 1829 he exchanged into the 6th Regiment,
and joined his father as aide-de-camp at Saugor, in Central India.
From June 1830 to Jan. 1831 he served as deputy-assistant
quartermaster-general at Saugor. In 1834 he married Miss Jane
Waring, of Newry, and retired on half-pay in Oct. of that year. In
1837 he was placed on full pay as captain in the 97th Regiment; and
in that year was sent in command of two companies of his regiment
and a troop of the 4th Dragoon Guards to quell the riots in
Yorkshire. In 1838 he retired from the army by the sale of his
commission, and sailed for South Australia the same year in the
<i>Rajahstan</i>, landing at Glenelg on Nov. 21st, 1838. He settled
with his family at O'Halloran Hill, and was made a J.P. in 1839. He
was gazetted Major-Commandant of the South Australian Militia on
Feb. 26th, 1840, and on June 8th as Commissioner of Police. When
the <i>Maria</i> was wrecked at Lacepede Bay, and the crew were
murdered by the blacks, Major O'Halloran went down with two other
gentlemen to investigate the matter, and hanged two of the natives.
This proceeding was very severely condemned by a number of
colonists, who made very strong representations upon the subject to
both the local and home Governments. The result, however, showed
that, whatever opinions might be entertained respecting the
abstract propriety of the summary measures adopted, they were in
reality the wisest and most merciful for both races, no organised
attack being afterwards made upon Europeans by the natives in that
part of the colony. He commanded several expeditions against the
blacks in 1840 and 1841, and resigned his appointment as
Commissioner of Police on April 12th, 1843. He was nominated on
June 15th, 1843, senior non-official member of the old nominee
Legislative Council, and sat till 1851, when the first instalment
of representative government was conceded. He took part in the
successful opposition to the official policy for the imposition of
royalties on minerals; but, having supported the then Governor in
his attempt to perpetuate State aid to religion, was defeated for
the district of Noarlunga when the Mixed Constitution was
proclaimed. In 1855 he unsuccessfully contested the Sturt. He was
gazetted a lieutenant-colonel of the Volunteer Military Force in
1854. When responsible government was conceded, he was returned at
the head of the poll over twenty-seven candidates for the
Legislative Council in March 1857. In 1862 he resigned his
commission as justice of the peace, owing to his strong disapproval
of some of the Government appointments to the magistracy. He
retired from the Legislative Council the following year, and died
at Lizard Lodge, O'Halloran Hill, on August 16th, 1870.</p>

army, and emigrated to South Australia in 1840. In that colony he
was appointed a member of the Audit Board in 1843, and subsequently
became private secretary to Governor Sir George Grey, and clerk of
the Executive Council. He was appointed Auditor-General, in
succession to Mr. F. C. Singleton, in 1851, and held the position
till 1868, when he finally retired from the public service. He died

<p><a name="A1050" id="A1050"></a><b>O'Loghlen, Hon. Sir Bryan</b>,
Bart., M.L.A., M.A., formerly Premier of Victoria, is the third son
of the late Right Hon. Sir Michael O'Loghlen, a distinguished Irish
judge, who was created a baronet in 1838, and who was the first
Roman Catholic raised to judicial office either in England or
Ireland after the revolution of 1688. Sir Bryan's elder brother,
Sir Colman O'Loghlen, represented the county of Clare in the
English Parliament from 1863 to 1877, and was Judge
Advocate-General in the Gladstone Government from 1868 to 1870. Sir
Bryan was born on June 27th, 1828, and was educated at St.
Clement's School, Oxford, Oscott College, Birmingham, and
ultimately at Trinity College, Dublin, where he entered in 1846 and
took honours in classics and mathematics. In 1847-8 he took part on
the national side in Irish politics, and in the latter year was
articled to Mr. T. Flanagan, the engineer of the Bolton, Blackburn,
and Clitheroe line, with the view of becoming a railway engineer.
Two years later the railway panic occurred, and Mr. O'Loghlen (as
he then was) took to farming some of the family acres in county
Clare. He grew tired of this too, and passed the year 1851 in a
mercantile office in London. The next year he hit upon his
<i>metier</i>, and decided to read for the Bar. With this view he
went back to Trinity College, Dublin, where he was classed as a
junior moderator in the degree examination (B.A. 1856) and received
a silver medal. After reading in his brother, Sir Michael's
chambers, he was called to the Irish Bar in Easter term, 1856. He
spent five years on the Munster circuit, and then decided to
emigrate to Australia, arriving in Melbourne in Jan. 1862. Here he
was admitted to the local Bar in Feb. following, and entering on
the active practice of his profession, was appointed Crown
Prosecutor in April 1863. From 1871 to Jan. 1877 Mr. O'Loghlen was
employed in this capacity in the metropolitan district and
conducted some of the heaviest criminal cases in the colony. At the
general election in May 1877, when the Berry party swept the
country, Mr. O'Loghlen came forward for North Melbourne as an
advanced Liberal, advocating annual elections, payment of members
(since conceded), deprivation of the Upper House of the power of
rejecting money bills, a free university and free and compulsory
but religious primary instruction. He was defeated by only sixteen
votes, and on July 22nd in the same year succeeded to the baronetcy
on the death of his surviving elder brother. His friends in Clare
at once put him in nomination as his brother's successor in the
representation of the county, and, despite the disadvantage of
absence, he was returned at the head of the poll by an overwhelming
majority over The O'Gorman Mahon and Mr. Reeves, who both also
stood. In Jan. 1878 Sir Charles MacMahon resigned his seat for West
Melbourne, and Sir Bryan O'Loghlen at once plunged into the fray as
the Berryite candidate for the vacancy. He was opposed by Mr. J. G.
Francis, an ex-Premier and probably the most popular embodiment of
Conservatism in the colony. Popular enthusiasm on the side of the
new Liberalism was, however, at its height, and on Feb. 4th Sir
Bryan beat his doughty opponent by a majority of ninety votes, the
contest exciting greater interest, owing to the strained nature of
the political situation, than was probably ever aroused by a
bye-election in the short but pregnant history of Victoria. Mr.
Trench, the Attorney-General, subsequently resigned, and Sir Bryan
O'Loghlen took his place on March 27th. He had thus again to go
before the electors of West Melbourne within seven weeks of his
first fight. Again Mr. Francis opposed him, and again Sir Bryan
O'Loghlen repulsed the assault, though by a reduced majority. As
legal adviser to the Government in the stormy times of the contest
between the two Houses over the payment of members, "tack," and the
"Black Wednesday" dismissals, Sir Bryan O'Loghlen had now to act a
very similar part to that played by Mr. Higinbotham in the first
M?Culloch Ministry, the bone of discord being in each case the
claim of the Lower House to absolute financial supremacy over the
Upper. The constitutional deadlock appearing insurmountable, it was
decided to send an "embassy" (as it was called) to England to
invoke the interference of the imperial authorities with a view to
effecting necessary reforms for the liberalisation of the
Legislative Council. It was at first intended that Sir Bryan
O'Loghlen should form one of the deputation, but ultimately Mr.
Berry and Professor Pearson went alone, leaving Sir Bryan O'Loghlen
to cope with the acerbity of an excited political situation, with
the added responsibilities of acting Premier during Mr. Berry's
absence from Dec. 1878 to Nov. 1879. In the meantime the Elections
Committee of the House of Commons had declared Sir Bryan
O'Loghlen's seat for Clare vacant, owing to his having accepted an
office of profit under the Crown&mdash;viz., the Victorian
attorney-generalship&mdash;and he did not again contest the seat.
In Feb. 1880 the elections turned against the once unboundedly
popular Berry Ministry, and Sir Bryan O'Loghlen in consequence
resigned with his colleagues in the following month, having
previously been defeated for West Melbourne. Later on he was
returned for West Bourke, and having in the meantime become
estranged from the Berry party, who had come into office again in
the interval, moved a vote of want of confidence in them, which on
July 1st, 1881, was carried by 41 votes to 38. Mr. Berry at once
resigned, and Sir Bryan O'Loghlen was sent for, and on July 9th
assumed office as Premier, with the posts of Attorney-General and
Treasurer. The new Government had hardly any direct supporters in
the House, but by the forbearance of the Liberal and Conservative
parties, who were neither of them strong enough to take office,
they held on till the general election in Feb. 1883, when Sir Bryan
O'Loghlen lost his seat for West Bourke, and his Ministry was
displaced by the Service-Berry Coalition Government (March 1888).
Sir Bryan O'Loghlen, who was soon afterwards returned for Port
Fairy, for which he still sits, remained in opposition to the
Service-Berry and Gillies-Deakin Ministries until Oct. 1890, when
he assisted Mr. Munro to tern out the latter, but did not himself
take office. During the session of 1890 he distinguished himself by
his outspoken opposition to intercolonial federation, and
especially to the form of it embodied in the Commonwealth Bill
which emanated out of the Sydney Convention. Sir Bryan O'Loghlen,
who is looked on as the leader of the Catholic party in Parliament,
is a supporter of the Shiels Ministry. He married on Sept. 17th,
1863, Ella, third daughter of James Mackay Seward, of Melbourne. He
was made an Hon. M.A. of Melbourne University in 1877.</p>

Investment Board.</p>

Campbell</b>, B.A., Chief Justice of Western Australia, is the
fourth son of Arthur Pooley Onslow, of Send Grove, Ripley, Surrey,
by his wife, Rosa Roberta, daughter of Alexander Macleay, F.R.S.,
Speaker of the first Legislative Council of New South Wales. He was
born on July 17th, 1842, and was educated at Westminster and
Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1864. He
entered at the Inner Temple on Jan. 15th, 1862, was called to the
bar on Nov. 17th, 1868, and went the Home Circuit. He married, on
Feb. 4th, 1878, Madeline Emma, daughter of Rev. Robert Loftus
Tottenham, of Florence, and granddaughter of the Bishop of Clogher.
He was Attorney-General of British Honduras from 1878 to 1880, and
Attorney-General of Western Australia from 1880 to 1883. In July of
the latter year he was appointed Chief Justice, in which capacity
he administered the government during the absence of Sir F. Napier
Broome in England in 1884-5. His relations with that Governor
having subsequently become strained, the latter "interdicted" him
from his functions as Chief Justice, for the alleged premature and
improper publication of certain correspondence then pending between
them and with the Colonial Office. The Executive Council
unanimously confirmed the interdict, and placed Mr. Onslow on
half-pay pending the decision of the Colonial Office. In the
result, Lord Knutsford reinstated Mr. Onslow, but censured him.
Ultimately, in view of the attitude assumed by the Chief Justice in
adjudicating on certain cases of newspaper libel, the Legislative
Council passed a resolution requesting the Home Government, in the
interests of tranquillity, to transfer him to some other location.
He was accordingly given, a year's leave of absence; and this
having been again extended, Sir H. T. Wrensfordsley was sent out to
the colony in 1890 as Acting Chief Justice. Mr. Onslow returned to
Western Australia and resumed his occupancy of the office of Chief
Justice in July 1891.</p>

daughter of Alexander Macleay, F.B.S., sometime Colonial Secretary
and Speaker of the Legislative Council of New South Wales, was born
at Trichinopoly on August 2nd, 1833, and was taken to Sydney when
five years old. In 1841 he went to England, and entered the royal
navy in 1847 on board the <i>Howe</i>, commanded by Sir Jas.
Stirling, first Governor of Western Australia. After seeing much
active service, especially in the suppression of the slave trade
off the west coast of Africa, Captain Onslow was employed on the
<i>Herald</i> in 1857 in surveying "Shark's Bay," and the numerous
detached coral reefs on the Eastern Australian coast, outside the
Great Barrier Reefs and in Torres Straits. In 1861 he returned to
England, and two years later became commander, and in 1871 retired
from the navy with the rank of post-captain. In August 1867 he
married Elizabeth, only daughter of James Macarthur (<i>q.v.</i>).
In 1870 he was returned to the Assembly for Camden, and in 1874
accompanied Mr. (afterwards Sir) Wm. Macleay on his expedition to
New Guinea in the Chevert. Captain Onslow died on Jan. 30th,
1882.</p>

Hillier, Earl of</b>, G.C.M.G., late Governor and
Commander-in-Chief of New Zealand, son of George Augustus Cranley
(grandson of Thomas, 2nd earl, and nephew of Arthur George, 3rd
earl), by Mary Harriet Ann, eldest daughter of Lieut.-General
William F. B. Loftus, of Kilbride, co. Wicklow, was born on March
7th, 1853, and was educated at Eton and Exeter College, Oxford. He
succeeded his great-uncle as 4th earl on Oct. 24th, 1870. He was
one of the Lords-in-waiting in 1880 and again in 1886, and is Lord
High Steward of Guildford. In Feb. 1887 Lord Onslow was appointed
Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the Colonies, and in that
capacity acted as Vice-President of the Colonial Conference in that
year. He was also one of the British delegates at the International
Conference on the Sugar Bounties. In Feb. 1888 Lord Onslow became
Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, and in the next year
was appointed to the Governorship of New Zealand, in succession to
Lieut.-General Sir William Jervois. This post he resigned at the
end of 1891, and quitted New Zealand in March of the next year,
arriving in England in June. Lord Onslow, who was created K.C.M.G.
in 1887 and G.C.M.G. in 1889, married in 1875 Hon. Florence
Coulston, daughter of Alan, 3rd Lord Gardner. Lord Onslow, from the
time of his arrival in the colony, manifested a strong personal
interest in the land of his temporary sojourn, and gave evidence of
his determination to give New Zealand associations a place in his
after-life. His Excellency did what he could, by precept and
example, to foster a taste for legitimate sport, he encouraged and
aided the labours of Acclimatisation societies, and he used his
personal influence with Ministers to get certain islands lying off
the coast proclaimed as perpetual preserves for native birds, so as
to save from extinction the various interesting species for which
New Zealand ornithology has become so famous. He lost no
opportunity of collecting rare birds for transmission to the
Zoological Society of London, and commenced the formation at
Government House of what may hereafter prove to be a very valuable
ethnological collection. In further proof that he desired to have
his future linked with New Zealand, on the birth of a son at
Wellington he determined to give him a Maori name. Her Majesty the
Queen, at the joint request of the Jubilee mayors of the four
principal cities, had consented to be the child's godmother, and by
royal command the first names were Victor Alexander, to which was
added the family name of Herbert. After much deliberation, the
third name, selected as a compliment to the Maori people, was that
of Huia. The choice was a very happy one, as it linked the
Governor's family with the most ancient Maori blood in the land,
and brought the infant into brotherhood with the most powerful and
most civilised chiefs in the North Island. After the child had been
christened in due form, he was taken to Otahi by his parents on
Sept. 12th, 1891, to be presented to the tribe whose name he had
taken. The tribes from all parts of the surrounding country
assembled to take part in the function, and the ceremonial was a
very impressive one. The representative chiefs made speeches of
welcome full of pathos and poetry, recounting the achievements of
their forefathers who had "gone away into the eternal night" and
drawing a pathetic picture of the decadence of the race. But
throughout the speeches there was a full recognition of the honour
the Governor had conferred on the Ngatihuia tribe. It was thus
expressed by one of the speakers:&mdash;"Other governors have said
kind things and done kind things, but it has been reserved for you,
Governor, to pay this great compliment to the Maori people: that of
giving to your son a Maori name. According to our ancient customs,
no greater courtesy could be shown by one great tribe to another
great tribe, and there was no surer way of cementing the bonds of
friendship. It has long been said, 'Let the Pakeha and the Maori be
one people,' and you have given practical shape to this by
accepting for your son the name of an ancient chief. We invoke the
spirits of our ancestors to witness this day that in your son Huia
the friendship of the two races becomes united!" Lord Onslow having
made a suitable reply, the hereditary young chief of the Ngatihuia,
Tamihana Te Hoia, stepping forward, said:&mdash;"And now, O
Governor and Lady Onslow, bring forward the infant Huia, that the
tribe may do him honour." On being taken from the nurse's arms and
presented to him, Tamihana solemnly "rubbed noses" with the child
before the whole tribe, all the women present joining their voices
in a soft and plaintive lullaby, composed expressly for the
occasion. After this formal reception of Huia, there followed an
incident of a touching kind, for all the chiefs of the tribe came
forward and cast their offerings before the child, Costly robes of
Maori workmanship in profusion, carved boxes, and ancient
greenstones gave tangible expression to the genuineness of the
Maori feeling.</p>

St. George</b>, R.E., G.C.M.G., C.B., sometime Governor of Western
Australia, was the son of the late H. Ord, and was born in 1819. He
entered the Royal Engineers in 1837, and was promoted to be
lieutenant in 1839, captain in 1846, brevet-major in 1854,
lieut.-colonel in 1859, and major-general in 1869. He served
principally in the West Indies and on the coast of Africa. He acted
as brigade-major in the combined French and English expedition to

for which he received brevet rank. He was employed under the
Colonial Office in 1855-6 as Commissioner to the Gold Coast; and in
1856-7 and 1860 at the courts of Paris and the Hague, to assist the
ambassador and minister in carrying out negotiations with respect

Africa in Oct. 1864, and was made Governor of the Straits
Settlements in 1867. He was Governor of Western Australia from Nov.
12th, 1877, to April 6th, 1880. He married in 1846 Julia Graham,

<p><a name="A1057" id="A1057"></a><b>Ormond, Hon. Francis</b>,
M.L.C., the well-known Victorian philanthropist, was the son of
Captain Ormond, of the Mercantile Marine, who in 1839 visited Port
Phillip, and having determined to settle there, bought a small ship
and brought out his family (including his son Francis) in 1842. The
glowing reports from the new colony of New Zealand induced him to
go on thither, instead of settling, as he had intended, in what is
now Victoria. He soon, however, brought his family back to the
latter colony, and settled at Geelong. Mr. Francis Ormond was born
at Aberdeen, Scotland, on Nov. 23rd, 1829, and was educated at
Tyzack's Academy in Liverpool In Victoria, after a somewhat rough
life as a lad, he was at first engaged in mercantile pursuits, and
then went into squatting, in which he was very successful. He was
made a territorial magistrate in 1855. When the Melbourne
University was incorporated, ground adjacent to the main building
was reserved for four denominational colleges, and in Nov. 1877 the
Presbyterian Church decided to build on their portion at a cost of
£10,000, to be raised by public subscription. It soon, however,
became evident that more than £10,000 would be required, and Mr.
Ormond in the first instance offered to contribute £1000 if £9000
were subscribed by others. About £6000 was got in, and then Mr.
Ormond announced that he would give £10,000 if a like sum were got
elsewhere to make up a total of £20,000. This was accomplished,
and, in addition to his first £10,000, Mr. Ormond in Nov. 1880,
when the college was opened, gave £2571 to complete the erection of
the tower, and offered to give £2500 extra for endowment provided
£7500 was raised elsewhere. Finally he undertook to pay the whole
cost of the buildings (about £22,500), thus setting free the whole
of the receipts from other sources to defray the cost of fittings
and the current expenses of the institution. In 1883 additions were
made to the building, and in 1887 Mr. Ormond erected the Victoria
wing, to commemorate the Queen's Jubilee. Altogether Mr. Ormond
contributed £40,000 to the building fund of the college. Mr. Ormond
mooted the idea of a working men's college for Melbourne in 1881,
and offered to give £5000 towards its establishment if others gave
£5000, and the Government a site. At first the project was received
coldly, but with the aid of Bishop Moorhouse, Mr. Higinbotham, and
others, the initial difficulties were got over, and a site was
secured near the public library, Mr. Ormond being the first
president of the institution. It was found that the gildings would
cost £20,000, and Mr. Ormond offered to erect them if £7500 were
contributed from other sources towards the endowment, and the name
were changed to the "Leopold Working Men's College," to commemorate
the late Prince Leopold. It was found, however, impossible to raise
the £7500, and when Mr. Ormond reduced the required subvention to
£5000, this too was found not to be feasible. There was a strong
objection, too, to the change of name. The offer therefore lapsed,
but Mr. Ormond contributed £500 a year to the maintenance fund for
two years. The college was opened in 1887, and proved highly
successful, there being two thousand names on the roll of students
at the time of Mr. Ormond's death in 1889. In 1887 Mr. Ormond
offered to contribute £20,000 towards the endowment of a chair of
music at the Melbourne University, on condition that the public
subscribed £2500 to endow scholarships. The condition was promptly
complied with, and Mr. Ormond paid over the £20,000 to the credit
of the university. It was, however, a considerable time before an
eligible professor could be found to accept the stipend of £1000
per annum. Mr. Ormond died whilst on a visit to Europe, in the
south of France, on May 5th, 1889. His first wife was the daughter
of Dr. Greeves, and in 1886 he married a daughter of Mr. Ebenezer
Oliphant, formerly of Victoria. By his will and codicils Mr. Ormond
bequeathed the following legacies to public objects: £5000 each to
the Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne Benevolent Asylum, Melbourne
Protestant Orphan Asylum, Melbourne Deaf and Dumb Asylum, Melbourne
Blind Asylum, Melbourne Sailors' Home, Melbourne Alfred Hospital,
and Melbourne Sick Children's Hospital; £40,000 to the Ormond
College; £10,000 to the Melbourne Working Men's College; £5000 each
to the Geelong Hospital, Geelong Benevolent Asylum, Ballarat
Hospital, and Ballarat Benevolent Asylum; £1000 each to the St.
George's Presbyterian Church, Geelong, the Toorak Presbyterian
Church, and the Gordon Technical College, Geelong; and £500 to the
Skipton Presbyterian Church. He also directed that any residue
should be divided so as to increase the above legacies
proportionately to their several amounts.</p>

sat, with the exception of a three years' interval, till 1890. In
the Fox Ministry Mr. Ormond was Minister of Public Works from Dec.
1871 to Sept. 1872, and acted in the same capacity in the
Waterhouse Ministry in Oct. 1872. When Major Atkinson assumed the
premiership, after the departure of Sir Julius Vogel, Mr. Ormond

he succeeded Mr. Carleton as Chairman of Committees in the House of
Representatives, and was reappointed in 1875 and 1876. He was
Secretary for Crown Lands and Minister for Immigration in the
Waterhouse, Fox and Vogel Ministries (which were, in effect, the
same Ministry), from Oct. 1872 to August 1874, when, not being able
to agree with Mr. Vogel's project to abolish the provinces, he

founders of St. Patrick's Society, and for many years represented
the Roman Catholic body on the denominational board of education.
He was appointed one of the trustees of the Public Library. In 1856
he was one of the chief promoters of the Colonial Bank, and acted
as chairman of its board of directors for fourteen years. When the
colony was separated from New South Wales, in 1851, Mr. O'Shanassy
was returned to the first Legislative Council as one of the members
for Melbourne, and became the virtual leader of the opposition to
the official and nominee element in that body. Mr. O'Shanassy, who
had been one of the strongest advocates of separation from New
South Wales, now became one of the warmest champions of the
establishment of responsible government and of the
anti-transportation movement. During the troubles which ensued on
the attempt to enforce the gold diggers' licence Mr. O'Shanassy was
one of the six members of the royal commission which was appointed
by Sir Charles Hotham to inquire into the condition of the
goldfields of Victoria. He was also one of the members of the
committee appointed by the Council to report upon the best form of
a constitution for the colony. At the elections for the first
Legislative Assembly, in Sept. 1856, Mr. O'Shanassy was re-elected
for Melbourne, and was also returned a few days later for Kilmore,
for which constituency he took his seat. Early in 1857 the Haines
Government (the first formed after the concession of responsible
government) resigned, and in March of that year Mr. O'Shanassy
accepted office as Premier and Chief Secretary, and was re-elected
for Kilmore; but a vote of want of confidence having been carried
seven weeks later, he resigned. Mr. O'Shanassy returned to office
as Premier and Chief Secretary in March 1858, on the break-up of
the Haines Government through the rejection of the schedule of
their Increase of Members Bill, and was re-elected for Kilmore. It
fell to the lot of the O'Shanassy Government to negotiate the first
Victorian public loan, which, to the amount of £8,000,000, was
successfully floated through the agency of six of the Melbourne
banks. Mr. O'Shanassy was re-elected for Kilmore at the general
election in 1859, but retired from office in the following October,
as the result of a vote of want of confidence. In Nov. 1861 the
Heales Ministry were defeated on their budget, and Mr. O'Shanassy
became for the third time Premier and Chief Secretary. Amongst the
important measures fathered by the Ministry were the Crown Lands
Act of 1862&mdash;which, though it largely failed in its object,
was intended to encourage the settlement of small holders upon the
public lands&mdash;and the Local Government Act, to the shaping of
which Mr. O'Shanassy devoted much personal attention. In June 1863
he left office with his colleagues, and never returned to it,
though often apparently on the verge of doing so. He, however,
continued down to his death to occupy a very prominent position in
the public eye as an unflinching upholder of the claims of his
fellow Roman Catholics, and as one of the most broad-minded
advocates of Conservative, or as they grew to be called
Constitutional, politics. He was re-elected for Kilmore in 1864,
but was not a member in 1866, in which year he visited Europe, and
was created by Pope Pius IX., in recognition of his services in the
cause of Catholic education, a Knight of the Order of St. Gregory
the Great. Mr. O'Shanassy returned to Victoria in 1867, and entered
the Legislative Council in Feb. 1868, as member for the Central
province, being re-elected for ten years in August 1872.
Subsequently he unsuccessfully opposed the Secular Education,
State-Aid to Religion Abolition, and Payment of Members Bills. In
April 1874, in which year he was created K.C.M.G., having been made
C.M.G. in 1870, he resigned his seat in the Council, and after two
unsuccessful contests re-entered the Assembly as member for
Belfast, in May 1877. He was an unwavering freetrader, a
pro-immigrationist, and favoured a united form of government for
the Australian, rather than the federal system. Sir John O'Shanassy
had a singularly comprehensive grasp of constitutional questions,
and was a most powerful speaker; the only obstacle to his complete
success as a statesman being his paramount devotion to the
interests of his creed. He married in 1839 Margaret, daughter of M.
McDonnell of Thurles, and died on May 8th, 1883. Lady O'Shanassy
died on July 13th, 1887.</p>

addition to the premiership, he was Colonial Secretary, and for the
last year of its existence acted as Secretary for Lands. He
resigned in Jan. 1874, and, leaving Port Curtis, for which he had
sat for thirteen years, was elected for Brisbane. He was Colonial
Secretary and Secretary for Public Instruction in the first

1846. In the latter year he was nominated to the Legislative
Council of that colony, and was Chairman of Committees of the whole
Council till 1855, when responsible government was conceded, and he
sat for Parramatta in the first Legislative Assembly from 1856 to
1858. He was Premier and Colonial Secretary of the third
administration formed in New South Wales in Oct. 1856, and held
office till Sept. 1857. Having been knighted in 1858, he shortly
afterwards returned to England, where he resided at Stawell House,

Australian Museum in Sydney from 1848 to 1856 and official trustee
from 1856 to 1857, was created K.C.M.G. in 1877. He married in 1843

regarded as the leader of the elected members in the movement for
obtaining responsible government. He came to England in 1890, with
Sir Thos. Campbell, to assist the Home Government in carrying the
new Constitution Bill through Parliament. He was eminently
successful in his efforts, and gave important evidence before the
select committee of the House of Commons presided over by Baron
Henry de Worms, which resulted in the passing of the Bill freed
from all restrictions as to the territorial control to be exercised
by the colonial authorities under the new constitution. Mr. Parker,

Alliance Bank in London, but resigned in 1867 to enter the service
of the Bank of Australasia in Melbourne, sailing for Australia in
August 1867. He was appointed Inspector in Nov. 1867, General
Inspector in Oct. 1871, and succeeded Mr. D. C. Macarthur in 1876
as Superintendent, a position which he held down to the time of his
death. On May 11th, 1887, Mr. Parkes was injured in a railway
accident on the line between Prahran and Windsor, near Melbourne,
and died the same day, after having had both his legs

<p><a name="A1076" id="A1076"></a><b>Parkes, Hon. Sir Henry</b>,
G.C.M.G., ex-Premier of New South Wales, is the son of the late
Thomas Parkes, a farmer on Lord Leigh's Warwickshire estate, and
was born at Stoneleigh in that county on May 27th, 1815. He
acquired some rudimentary education at a dame's school at
Kenilworth, and at a hardly more ambitious academy at Gloucester.
The fact that his school training ended at eleven years of age will
sufficiently illustrate the process of self-education which the
most literary of Australasian Premiers has constantly been
undergoing and extending. Though he has recently denied that he
ever formally associated himself with the Chartist agitation, it is
undoubted that he was warmly interested, as a working youth, in the
advanced Liberal movements of the time. Attracted by the freer
range which colonial life seemed to offer, Mr. Parkes emigrated to
New South Wales in March 1839, and spent some portion of his early
Australian career as a farm labourer on the Regentville estate of
Mr. John Jamieson, near Penrith. Several of the poems, which he
ultimately published in a collected form, have reference to this
period of his colonial life. It was in Sydney, however, that his
most remarkable vicissitudes were experienced. For some time he was
engaged in an iron store, and subsequently worked in a foundry. He
then started business as an ivory turner, and was afterwards a
dealer in toys in Hunter Street, Sydney. He now began to figure in
the political arena as a leading agitator on the progressive side
and a vehement opponent of the transportation system. On these
lines he took a prominent part in securing the return of Mr. Lowe
(afterwards Lord Sherbrooke) to the partially elective Legislative
Council as member for Sydney. A year later he started the Empire
newspaper, which he edited until 1857 under great pecuniary
difficulties as the organ of metropolitan Liberalism. In 1853 Mr.
Parkes himself unsuccessfully contested Sydney, but was returned
for the city by a majority of two to one in the following year. The
colony was now in the throes of the great struggle which culminated
in the concession of responsible government. Mr. Parkes
distinguished himself by his fervid protests against the nominee
Upper House, which was subsequently established under the
Constitution Act. He was more successful in his opposition to Mr.
Wentworth's pet project for the institution of a hereditary
colonial peerage on the English model. Responsible government
having been conceded, Mr. Parkes represented East Sydney in the
Legislative Assembly from 1858 to 1861, when the late Right Hon. W.
B. Dalley and himself were sent to England as commissioners for
promoting emigration. Their mission proved a comparative failure,
owing to their having no power to grant assistance to emigrants,
but there are persons engaged in extensive businesses in the colony
who came out in consequence of their representations. Mr. Parkes
acted as correspondent of the Sydney Morning Herald during the
tour, and a selection of his letters was published by Messrs.
Macmillan &amp; Co. in London, under the title, "Australian Views
of England." Returning to Sydney in 1863, he was re-elected to the
Assembly in the following year for a country constituency. Mr.
Parkes first took ministerial office in Jan. 1866, when he was
appointed Colonial Secretary in the Administration of Mr.
(afterwards Sir) James Martin. He, however, resigned in Sept. 1868,
owing to a difference with his colleagues on a minor matter of
administration, but not before he had signalised his term of office
by passing the Public Schools Act, on which the present educational
system of New South Wales is based. After being for a few months
out of Parliament, Mr. Parkes was elected for Mudgee in 1871, and
in the following year became Premier of the colony, with the post
of Colonial Secretary. Mr. Parkes had made himself prominent in
Opposition as the staunch advocate of the free-trade policy to
which New South Wales adhered till 1892. He strongly opposed the 5
per cent, ad valorem duties imposed by the Cowper Ministry in
1865-6, and vindicated his consistency by taking advantage of a
period of great financial prosperity to effect their repeal in the
year 1878. The Parkes Government, having been censured in relation
to the release of the prisoner Gardiner, resigned office in Feb.
1875, and the ex-Premier for some time left the leadership of the
Opposition to subordinates. In March 1877, however, he again came
to the front, and succeeded in carrying a vote of want of
confidence in the Robertson Administration, becoming Premier and
Colonial Secretary until August. In the same year he was created
K.C.M.G., having previously refused the C.M.G. Later (in 1877) he
coalesced with his old opponent, Sir John Robertson, and formed a
Ministry in conjunction with that statesman, in which he was
Premier and Colonial Secretary, and which lasted from Dec 1878 to
Jan. 1883. In 1882 Sir Henry Parkes visited England and was
received with much distinction in political and literary circles.
On his return the Government was defeated on a measure for amending
the Land Act, and met with an unfavourable response when they
appealed to the country, Sir Henry Parkes being himself defeated in
East Sydney, and having to take refuge in a country electorate. For
some time subsequently Sir Henry took very little active part in
politics, and in the interval again revisited England. On his
return he swept the country at the general election in Jan. 1887,
free trade being nominally the question which decided the issue,
but the result being really a vote of personal confidence in Sir
Henry Parkes as the only man in the colony capable of grappling
with the exigencies of the situation. He now formed his fourth
administration, again repealing the ad valorem duties imposed by
his predecessors, and held office until Jan. 1889, when he retired,
owing to an adverse vote. Mr. Dibbs, who succeeded him, only held
office until March, when Sir Henry commenced his last memorable
Premiership. During his fourth term of office as Prime Minister,
Sir Henry Parkes supported Sir Thomas McIlwraith's contention that
the colonial governments should be consulted by the Imperial
authorities in the appointment of Governors, and carried an address
to the Crown, embodying this view, arguing that future Governors
should be selected from the class of public men eligible for
Cabinet office at home. In 1889, during Sir Henry Parkes' fifth
term of office, General Edwards, who had been instructed to
investigate the military defences of the Australasian colonies,
handed in a recommendation that the forces of the seven colonies
should be federalised for purposes of common defence. Sir Henry
Parkes cordially endorsed the suggestion, and seized the
opportunity to inculcate the desirability of a complete political
federation of the Australasian colonies. The fact that Sir Henry
Parkes had from the first treated the Federal Council of
Australasia, in which the other colonies were associated, with
ill-concealed contempt, and had been instrumental in preventing New
South Wales from participating in its deliberations, rendered
Victoria somewhat suspicious of the olive branch which he now
offered, especially after his official attempt to appropriate the
national title of "Australia" for New South Wales alone.
Ultimately, however, all difficulties and jealousies were overcome,
and an Intercolonial conference was held in Melbourne in Feb. 1890,
at which, despite the fact that Mr. Gillies, the Premier of
Victoria, presided over its deliberations, Sir Henry Parkes, as the
promoter of the conclave, was naturally the most prominent and
interesting figure. The greatest unanimity prevailed, and the
Convention held in Sydney in March 1891 was the outcome of the
resolutions arrived at and of the subsequent action of the Colonial
Legislatures. Sir Henry Parkes was very fittingly elected to
preside over its deliberations. Sir Henry, who was awarded the gold
medal of the Cobden Club, and was created G.C.M.G. in 1888,
married, in 1835, Miss Clarinda Varney, who died in 1888; and
secondly, in 1889, Mrs. Dixon. He stands prominent amongst colonial
statesmen for the generous encouragement which he has afforded to
struggling literary and artistic merit. In 1890 he broke his leg;
but, despite his advanced age, has apparently quite recovered from
the effects of the accident The general election of June to July
1891 resulted in the return of a minority of Ministerial
supporters, and gave to the labour members the deciding voice in
the New South Wales Assembly. For some time the latter supported
Sir Henry Parkes, but in Oct. 1891 they threw their weight into the
scale against him, and he was compelled to resign office. He
subsequently retired from the leadership of the Opposition.</p>

<p><a name="A1077" id="A1077"></a><b>Parnell, Samuel Duncan</b>,
generally regarded as the originator of the Eight Hours Movement in
New Zealand, and probably in Australasia, was a native of England,
and was born in Feb. 1810. So far back as 1884, while working at
his trade in London, he was impressed with the idea of agitating
for shortening the hours of labour, and when he landed at the
infant settlement of Port Nicholson, New Zealand, early in 1840,
his first employment, that of constructing a wooden house, was
begun under the stipulation that eight hours should be a day's work
for himself and his fellow-workmen. Within a few years an attempt
was made to increase the length of the working day; but the men
interested, navvies working on the Hutt road from Wellington,
struck work until the original eight-hours' plan was reverted to.
From that date to the present time eight hours has been the
recognised day's labour for Wellington tradesmen. Mr. Parnell died
on Dec. 17th, 1890, and his funeral was attended by the members of
the Ministry as well as by a procession of the Trades.</p>

born in 1830 at Government House, Sydney, N.S.W., where his father
had taken up his residence in the previous year, as commissioner
for the Australian Agricultural Company. He went to England with

College, Oxford, where he graduated first class in classics in
1852. He was ordained deacon in 1854 and priest in 1855, and after
holding minor preferments, was appointed Bishop Suffragan of Dover
for the diocese of Canterbury, in March 1870. He wrote a memoir of
his father, and "Memorials" of his brother, Commander Charles
Parry, R.N. In 1882 he was chosen by the Australian bishops to
succeed the late Bishop Barker as Bishop of Sydney and Metropolitan
of Australia, but he declined the nomination. Bishop Parry, who
married, in 1859, Matilda, eldest daughter of Benjamin Williams, of
Limpsfield, Surrey, died at Dover on April 11th, 1890.</p>

also under its control the affairs of the Northern Territory; and
in April 1881, when Mr. (now Sir) John Bray formed his first
Government, the conjoint portfolio was offered to and accepted by
Mr. Parsons, who personally visited the territory, and has since
displayed as much interest in its advancement as he had previously
done in the cause of popular education. In March 1884 he retired
from the Ministry, and was appointed Government Resident of the

<p><a name="A1081" id="A1081"></a><b>Pasley, Major-General Hon.
Charles</b>, C.B., R.E., formerly Commissioner of Public Works,
Victoria, was the son of the late Lieut.-General Sir Charles
Pasley, K.C.B., and Martha Matilda his wife. He was born at
Chatham, Kent, on Nov. 14th, 1824, and entered the army in Dec.
1843, becoming colonel in April 1876, and retiring from the army
with the honorary rank of major-general in August 1881. He served
at Bermuda in 1850, and arrived at Melbourne on Sept. 18th, 1853,
having been appointed in the spring of that year Colonial Engineer
to the colony of Victoria. He found himself at the head of a
considerable department, to which that of Colonial Architect was
very soon added, and subsequently that of Central Road Board. In
1854 he was member of a commission to make arrangements for an
exhibition of colonial products at the Paris Exhibition in the
following year. Later in the same year he was nominated to a seat
on the Legislative Council of Victoria. About this time the
Ballarat riots broke out, and he offered his services to the
Governor, Sir Charles Hotham, and was sent to the goldfields on a
special mission. In 1855 the new constitution came into force in
Victoria, and the first responsible ministry was formed by Mr.
Haines in November of that year, General Pasley taking the
portfolio of Commissioner of Public Works. On Dec. 10th he was
appointed a member of the Executive Council, and a few months later
was made by an Act of Council a joint trustee with Captain (now
Lieut.-General Sir Andrew) Clarke, R.E., for the Melbourne and
Mount Alexander Railway, purchased by Government. In 1856 Captain
Pasley was elected to the first Legislative Assembly for South
Bourke, and in March 1857 he resigned with the rest of the
Ministry, but ultimately consented to remain as professional head
of the Department of Public Works. The Houses of Parliament were
amongst the public buildings erected under his direction, and some
of the principal streets of Melbourne were laid out during his term
of office. The last public building with which he was connected was
the Melbourne Post Office, but this was not completed till after
his return to England. Captain Pasley also took great interest in
the Botanic Gardens and the Herbarium, which was built under his
auspices. In 1860 he resigned his connection with the Public Works
Department, with the intention of returning to England; but his
interest in the welfare of the colony of Victoria and of the city
of Melbourne was as keen as ever in after years. Before his
departure from the colony the New Zealand war broke out, and he
immediately offered his services, which were accepted the same day,
and he was appointed an extra member of Major-General (afterwards
Sir Thomas) Pratt's staff. Three months later he was severely
wounded by a bullet in the thigh, while in charge of the trenches,
after laying out and constructing a parallel needed in the capture
of the Kaihihi Pas. His wound proving serious, he became unfit for
further duty, and returned to Melbourne invalided. For his services
in New Zealand he was mentioned in despatches, and promoted to
brevet-major, he having become captain soon after his arrival in
Melbourne. In 1864 he was employed as Acting Agent-General for the
colony of Victoria, a temporary appointment which he held for four
years, with leave from the War Office, and afterwards from the
Admiralty, to accommodate the colony until they could make a
permanent appointment. In this capacity he superintended on behalf
of the colony the equipment of the Nelson, and the design,
construction, armament and despatch of the Cerberus turret-ship. He
again acted as Agent-General for Victoria from 1880 to 1882. From
1873 to 1882 he held the Imperial appointment of Director of Works
of the Navy, in succession to Sir Andrew Clarke. General Pasley,
who died at Chiswick on Nov. 11th, 1890, married at Hampton, on
March 29th, 1864, Charlotte, eldest daughter of the late John
Roberts, of Barzell, Sussex, who survives him.</p>

the Bar in June 1859. Having emigrated to Victoria, he practised
his profession there, but left that colony and entered the public
service of South Australia in March 1884, being appointed a special
magistrate and Judge of the Northern Territory in October of that
year. In 1890 he was appointed special magistrate at Port

August 1864, when he went to Queensland, and commenced business at
Rockhampton, where he acquired a large interest in the Mount Morgan
Gold Mining Company. Mr. Patterson, who has been Mayor of
Rockhampton, succeeded Mr. Archer in the representation of Blackall
in 1886, was elected for Rockhampton in 1888, and was a minister
without portfolio in the McIlwraith Ministry from June to Nov.
1888. On the reconstitution of the Ministry he was Colonial
Treasurer under Mr. Morehead from Nov. 1888 to Nov. 1889, when he
resigned the Treasurership. He was minister without portfolio till
the retirement of the Morehead Government in August 1890.</p>

<p><a name="A1084a" id="A1084a"></a><b>Paton, Rev. John Gibson</b>,
D.D., the well-known missionary, was the son of James Paton, a
stocking manufacturer at Kirkmahoe, Dumfries, Scotland, and Janet
Jardine (Rogerson) his wife. He was born at Braehead, Kirkmahoe, on
May 24th, 1824, and as a boy worked at his father's trade and as a
field labourer. Subsequently he obtained an appointment in
connection with the West Campbell Street Reformed Presbyterian
Congregation in Glasgow as district visitor and
tract&nbsp;distributer&nbsp;at £25 per annum, with the right of
receiving a year's training at the Free Church Normal Seminary. At
the latter he studied so hard that his health broke down, and he
had to return home. Later on he entered as a student at Glasgow
College, but had to leave after one session through lack of funds,
and was then for some time a school-teacher at Maryhill. For ten
years he worked in connection with the Glasgow City Mission,
studying meantime at the university of Glasgow and the Reformed
Presbyterian Divinity Hall and attending medical classes at the
Andersonian College. In Dec. 1857 Mr. Paton was licensed as a
preacher with the view of taking up missionary work in the New
Hebrides, and in March 1858 was ordained a minister in Dr.
Symington's church, Glasgow. On April 16th of the same year Mr.
Paton sailed from Greenock for Melbourne in the&nbsp;Clutha, and
proceeded thence in an American ship, landing at Aneityum, New
Hebrides, on August 30th. In Nov. Mr. Paton settled on the island
of Tanna, one of the group, and in the following March his wife,
Mary Anne, daughter of Peter Robert Robson, died. He struggled on
under great difficulties until Jan. 1862, when, owing to the
murderous attitude of the hostile natives, he had to abandon the
mission, quit Tanna, and return to Aneityum, without any of his
possessions save the clothes on his back and a single Bible. Mr.
Paton now proceeded to Australia to raise funds for the purchase of
a mission ship, and was so successful that he obtained enough to
build the&nbsp;Dayspring&nbsp;and also to justify a journey to
Scotland to bring out more missionaries. Leaving Australia in May
1863, he reached London in August, and proceeded to Scotland, where
success again crowned his efforts. In 1864 he was married in
Edinburgh to Miss Margaret Whitecross. The same year Mr. Paton
returned to Australia, landing in Sydney in Jan. 1865. In the
following year the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of
Victoria accepted his transference from the Church of Scotland and
adopted him as the first missionary from the Presbyterian Churches
of Australia to the New Hebrides. Mr. Paton now (Nov. 1866) took up
his location on the island of Aniwa, not far distant from Tanna,
and here for many years conducted a most successful mission. In
1884 he was commissioned to proceed to the United Kingdom to raise
further funds for the New Hebrides mission with special reference
to the purchase of a second mission ship, and was again successful.
Mr. Paton returned to Australia at the end of 1885. This account of
his career would be incomplete without some reference to his action
in regard to the Polynesian labour traffic, which he has always
strenuously opposed. In 1892, when Sir&nbsp;Samuel
Griffith&nbsp;proposed to renew the importation of Kanakas into
Queensland, he led the opposition to the project, and though
unsuccessful in preventing its adoption, probably his action had
much to do in procuring the adoption of stringent regulations to
prevent abuses. In 1890 his autobiography, edited by his brother,
was published in two parts by Messrs. Hodder &amp; Stoughton. [This
biography appeared in the <b>Supplement</b> at the end of the
book.]</p>

<p><a name="A1085" id="A1085"></a><b>Patterson, Hon. James
Brown</b>, M.L.A., J.P., was born at Alnwick, Northumberland, on
Nov. 18th, 1833, and is the youngest son of the late James
Patterson, district road inspector. He emigrated to Victoria in
1852, and went to the Forest Creek goldfields. In 1856 he was
engaged in farming at Glenlyon, near Daylesford, and during his
residence there married Miss Walton. Mr. Patterson was mayor of
Chewton for four years, and in 1871 entered Parliament for
Castlemaine, a district which he has represented in the Assembly
ever since. He first took office in Mr. (now Sir) Graham Berry's
Ministry, in August 1875, and held the position of Commissioner of
Public Works and Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works in
that Government till its defeat in October of the same year. To
these offices he was reappointed on Mr. Berry's return to power in
May 1877, and retained them till the Ministry, in which Mr.
Patterson also held the additional position of Postmaster-General
from July 1878 to March 1880, was ejected from office. In the third
Berry Ministry Mr. Patterson discharged with marked ability the
duties of Minister of Railways from August 1880 to July 1881. Mr.
Patterson revisited England in 1884-5, and did not return to office
till Feb. 1889, when he succeeded Mr. Walker as Minister of Customs
in the Gillies Administration, in which he was also Minister of
Public Works from June to Sept. 1890, and Postmaster-General from
that date until the government resigned, in November of the same
year. During the great Australian strike of 1890, Mr. Patterson
took the most prominent part in preserving the public peace in
Melbourne. After the defeat of the Gillies-Deakin Government, Mr.
Patterson visited England, and delivered important addresses on
Australia in Newcastle-on-Tyne and Alnwick.</p>

<p><a name="A1086" id="A1086"></a><b>Patteson, Right Rev. John

late Right Hon. Sir John Patteson the judge, by his marriage with
Frances Duke, only daughter of Lieut.-Colonel James Coleridge, and
sister of the late Right Hon. Sir John Taylor Coleridge. He was
born in 1827, and educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford,
becoming Fellow of Merton in 1850. Having laboured from 1855 under
Bishop Selwyn in New Zealand and the neighbouring islands, he was,
in 1861, consecrated first Bishop of Melanesia in the South
Pacific. He spent the rest of his life cruising about among the
islands that composed his diocese, working among the natives, by
whom he was much beloved. He vainly endeavoured to put a stop to
the kidnapping of Polynesians for the purpose of supplying the
labour market of Queensland and other colonies, and lost his life
in the attempt. Hearing that a vessel was on her way to the Santa
Cruz Islands to recruit labourers, he determined to visit the group
himself. He arrived at Nukapu on Sept. 20th, 1871, and, at the
request of two savages and in order to show confidence, got out of
his own boat and went into one of the native canoes in order to
land on the island. As soon as he was out of sight, on his way over
the reef to the shore, a volley of arrows was let fly at the
English boat, wounding some of the sailors and the Bishop's
chaplain, who subsequently died of his wounds. Later on the natives
on shore were seen by those on the bishop's vessel to turn a canoe
adrift, which was found to contain the dead body of the bishop,
rolled up in a mat. A small branch of the cocoa-nut palm, with five
knots in it, was stuck to the mat, supposed to signify that the
bishop's life had been taken in revenge for five lives of the
natives who had most likely been shot by the kidnappers. There were
also five wounds on his body. A very voluminous memoir of him has
been published by Miss Charlotte Yonge. It was afterwards elicited
that the bishop on landing was taken into a hut and there
treacherously clubbed to death. The majority of the islanders
disapproved of the bishop's murder, and the assassins were
banished. The man who struck the first blow fled to a neighbouring
island, and thence to Santa Cruz, where the chief had him shot. A
cross was erected to Bishop Patteson's memory at Nukapu by Bishop
(John) Selwyn in 1884.</p>

the far-famed Madame Berry and Berry Consols Gold Mining Companies,
the former being the richest deep alluvial mine in Australia. It
was, however, in connection with the Australian Natives Association
that he first became prominent in a political sense. In 1883 he was
appointed one of the Board of Directors, Vice-President in 1884,
and President in 1885 and 1886. At the general election in 1889 he
was returned to the Assembly for Clunes and Allendale, defeating
Mr. T. Cooper, the veteran chairman of committees; and in Nov.
1890, when the Munro Ministry was formed, Mr. Peacock accepted a

his marriage with Harriet, daughter of Richard Puller, and younger
brother of the late Sir John Pearson, Judge of the High Court of
Justice, was born on Sept 7th, 1830, at Islington. He was educated
at Rugby, King's College, London, and at Oxford University, where
he matriculated on June 14th, 1849. He was scholar of Exeter
College from 1850 to 1853; B.A. in 1853; Fellow of Oriel College
from 1854 to 1873; M.A. in 1856; Honorary Fellow of King's College,
London, and Professor of Modern History from 1855 to 1865; Lecturer
on Modern History at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1869 to 1871.
He emigrated to South Australia in 1872, and was married at Gawler,
Dec. 10th, 1872, to Edith Lucille, eldest surviving daughter of
Philip Butler, of Tickford Abbey, Bucks. He removed to Victoria,
and became Lecturer in History and M.A. of Melbourne University in
1874. He was head master of the Presbyterian Ladies' College,
Melbourne, from 1875 to 1877; in the latter year Dr. Pearson
unsuccessfully contested Boroondara in the Liberal interest. He was
Royal Commissioner to inquire into the present state of education
from 1877 to 1878, in which year he was elected to the Legislative
Assembly for Castlemaine, and was selected to accompany Mr. (now
Sir) Graham Berry to England, to request the intervention of the
Home Government in the constitutional crisis then pending between
the two Houses. He was absent in England from Dec. 27th, 1878, to
June 17th, 1879. Dr. Pearson was member for Castlemaine till 1883,
when he was returned for East Bourke Boroughs, for which he sat
till the general election in April 1892, when he did not contest
the seat. He was minister without portfolio in the third Berry
Government from August 3rd, 1880, to July 9th, 1881; Minister of
Public Instruction in the Gillies-Deakin Ministry from Feb. 18th,
1886, to Nov. 1890. Dr. Pearson was editor of the National Review
1862-3, and has published "A History of England during the Early
and Middle Ages," in two volumes, 1861-8; "Historical Maps of
England during the First Thirteen Centuries," 1869, third edition
1884. After he went to Australia Dr. Pearson published "History of
England in the Fourteenth Century," and an "English Grammar," the
latter written in conjunction with Professor Strong (q.v.), with
whom he also collaborated in editing "Juvenal" for the University
of Oxford. Since 1877 Dr. Pearson has been a regular contributor to
the editorial columns of the Age and Leader, and has written
articles for the leading English periodicals. He is an honorary
LL.D. of the University of St. Andrews. As Minister of Public
Instruction, Dr. Pearson steadily set himself to separate primary
from secondary education, in opposition to the general and colonial
tendency, which is to run one into the other. He did this by
founding two hundred scholarships a year, which admit the scholars
of primary schools to high schools; by reducing the limit of
compulsory attendance from fifteen years of age to thirteen; by
increasing the term of statutory attendance from thirty days a
quarter to forty; and by liberally endowing special technical
schools, which have increased during his term of office from two to
fourteen. He brought over an expert from South Kensington to
reorganise the teaching of design; be raised the incomes of the
certificated teachers; and reduced the average expense of the
school system by employing teachers of slightly inferior
qualifications for the very small schools. A teacher is now sent to
any place where there is an average attendance of eight scholars.
Dr. Pearson is the firm advocate of secular education, as
established in the colony of Victoria, as the only system that can
be worked with fairness in a country divided between many sects.
Before leaving office he was preparing to abolish the system of
results, and laboured hard whilst he was Minister of Education,
though with very little success, to make the so-called compulsory
clauses of the Education Act a reality, as they are in
Switzerland.</p>

he formed the intention of returning to England, and Bishop
Moorhouse was desirous of securing his assistance as a suffragan
bishop for the diocese of Manchester; but the state of his health
made clerical duty impossible and rendered him incapable of
resigning his see until 1890, when the formal document was signed

in 1859. In 1848 Chief Justice Pedder had a dispute with Governor
Sir William Denison over the Dog Act, which the Supreme Court in
the previous year had declared to be void, although they had
previously failed to exercise their prerogative of pronouncing the
Act to be invalid on the ground of repugnancy to the Constitution
Act. The Chief Justice declined the suggestion of the Governor that
he should take leave of absence in order to admit of the reversal
of the judgment, and Sir William Denison then tried to have him
removed for neglect of duty in not having originally certified to
the repugnancy. The Executive Council, however, acquitted him, and
the Home Government ultimately censured the Governor for his
conduct in the matter. As, however, the judgment would have voided
fifteen Acts and rendered questionable thirty others, a bill was
passed validating all Acts not certified by the judges as repugnant
within fourteen days after enrolment, and thus the difficulty was
got over. [* Correct spelling is "Lewes".]</p>

Christchurch, N.Z., and at Stonyhurst, and matriculated at the
London University in 1875. He entered at the Middle Temple in April
1875, and was called to the English Bar in May 1878. Having
returned to New Zealand, he practised as a barrister and solicitor
in Christchurch, and was returned to the House of Representatives
for that city at the general election in the year 1887, and again
in Dec. 1890. On the meeting of Parliament in 1891, he was elected
Chairman of Committees of the House of Representatives, but
resigned the position on his appointment as Agent-General of the
colony in London in succession to Sir F. Dillon Bell. Mr. Perceval
left New Zealand in Oct 1891, and assumed the duties of the
position in the following month. He married in May 1880 Jessie, the
youngest daughter of the late Hon. John Johnston, M.L.C. (q.v.). In
1892 he was appointed to represent New Zealand on the governing
body of the Imperial Institute, and Knight Commander of St. Gregory

<p><a name="A1099" id="A1099"></a><b>Perry, Right Rev. Charles</b>,
M.A., D.D. first Church of England Bishop of Melbourne, Vict., was
the third son of John Perry, of Moor Hall, Essex (an eminent
shipbuilder at Blackwall and the originator of the East India
Docks), by his second wife, Mary, daughter of George Green, of
Blackwall. The late Bishop was born at Hackney, Middlesex, on Feb.
17th, 1807, and was educated at Dr. Heathcote's school, Hackney,
under Dr. Butler at Harrow, and at Trinity College, Cambridge,
where he graduated B.A. in 1828 as Senior Wrangler, first Smith's
prizeman, and seventh in the first class of the Classical Tripos
(bracketed equal with another competitor). He was elected Fellow of
Trinity in 1829, and after studying for the Bar from 1828 to 1831
(in which year he took his M.A. degree), returned to his college,
where he remained as tutor and assistant tutor till 1841. Dr. Perry
was ordained deacon in 1833, and priest in 1836; and married in
1841 Fanny, daughter of Samuel Cooper, of Tranby, near Hull. The
next year he took the living of St Paul's, Cambridge, which he held
till his appointment as first Bishop of Melbourne in 1847. To this
see, which was created on the subdivision of the diocese of
Australia, he was consecrated in Westminster Abbey on St. Peter's
Day in that year, and arrived in Melbourne by the ship Stag,
accompanied by Dean Macartney, on Jan. 23rd, 1848. He was installed
on the 28th in the cathedral church of St. James's (when he
preached his first sermon in Australia), and on Feb. 13th the
Queen's letters patent constituting Melbourne a bishop's see and
appointing Dr. Perry the first Bishop were read in St, Peter's
Church on the Eastern Hill. In this way Melbourne came to rank as a
city. On his arrival he found only three Anglican clergymen in his
diocese, and he had to lay the foundations of a system of Church
organisation amidst the social delirium of the first gold
discoveries. Belonging emphatically to the Evangelical or Low
Church school, Dr. Perry stamped its characteristics on the
discipline and theology of his budding diocese. He possessed the
business qualifications which, more than eloquent preaching, were
required in a pioneer diocesan in a new community, and was an
excellent organiser. The system of Church government through an
assembly of the clergy and of laymen elected in every parish was
adopted for the first time in Australia in the diocese of Melbourne
in 1854 under his ægis. Having witnessed an amazing extension of
Church influence and organisation under his rule, Bishop Perry
arrived at the conclusion to hand over the carrying on of the work
to a younger and stronger man. He left Melbourne for London on
April 26th, 1874, and resigned his see in the following year,
though the arrangements for the appointment of his successor, the
able and energetic Dr. Moorhouse (q.v.), were not completed till
1876. In May 1878 Bishop Perry was appointed prelate of the order
of St Michael and St George, and in Nov. of the same year
Prebendary and Canon of Llandaff. The latter preferment he resigned
in 1889, after a stroke of paralysis, which left him unfitted for
farther labour. He died on Dec. 2nd, 1891. The Bishop was made an
honorary M.A. of Melbourne University in 1869. By his will Dr.
Perry appointed as trustees of his Australian estate Mr. Henry
Henty, of Kew, Melbourne; Judge Thomas a'Beckett, of the Supreme
Court, Melbourne; and Mr. William Edward Morris, registrar of the
diocese of Melbourne. To the Melbourne Governesses' Association,
the Melbourne Clergy, Widows, and Orphans' Fund, the Melbourne
Church Missionary Society for the Chinese, and the Melbourne Church
Mission to the Aborigines, the testator left £50 each. Out of a sum
of £2000 due to his estate, if recovered, the sum of £1000 is to be
given to the Bishops of Melbourne and Ballarat for the churches of
their dioceses. The testator bequeathed the silver testimonial
plate presented to him on his resigning the bishopric of Melbourne
to Trinity College, Cambridge, for use by the master in his
lodge.</p>

M.P., ex-Prime Minister of South Australia, son of the late Rev.
Thomas Playford, of Bentham Street Chapel, Adelaide, and previously
sergeant-major in the British army, was born in London in 1837, and
came to South Australia with his father in 1843. For many years he
was engaged in farming at Mitcham, whence he removed to the hills
and took up gardening pursuits. He was for twenty-one years the
chairman of the East Torrens District Council, for three years a
member of the Central Road Board, and for four or five years the
president of the Association of District Chairmen. He made his
first appearance in Parliament in April 1868 as member for
Onkaparinga, a district which he represented until Nov. 1871. He
assisted Mr.  Strangways  in passing the first Land Bill
which gave farmers the chance of taking up land on deferred
payments. In 1872 he was defeated at Onkaparinga, but in Feb. 1875
was returned for East Torrens, which he continued to represent till
the general election of 1884, when he was rejected, being returned
for Newcastle on April 6th, 1887. He was again chosen for East
Torrens, however, at the general election in April 1890. Mr.
Playford was Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration in
Mr.  Boucaut's three Administrations: Feb. 2nd to March 25th,
1876; March 25th to June 6th, 1876; and Oct. 26th, 1877, to Sept.

William Morgan's two administrations from Sept 27th, 1878, to 10th
March, 1881, and from March 10th to June 24th, 1881. He was
Commissioner of Public Works in Mr.  Colton's first Ministry
from June 16th, 1884, to Feb.  4th, 1885, and Commissioner of
Crown Lands from Feb. 4th to June 16th, 1885. He took a prominent
part in defeating the  Downer  Government, and was
Premier and Treasurer from June 11th, 1887, to 27th June, 1889,
during which time he carried the first protective tariff. Mr.
Playford was one of the first two South Australian delegates to the
Federal Council of Australasia, and presided over the deliberations
of the third session, held at Hobart Jan. to Feb. 1889. He was
Dr.  Cockburn's colleague in the representation of South
Australia at the Federal Conference held in Melbourne in Feb. 1889,
and was again selected to represent the colony as one of the
delegates to the Federal Convention in 1891. He was ejected from
office in June 1889, but returned to power as Premier and Treasurer
in August 1890. In Jan. 1892, having taken the portfolio of Lands
instead of the Treasury, he paid a visit to India, with the view of
ascertaining the suitability of coolie labour for employment in the
tropical regions of the Northern Territory. Soon after his return
the Ministry were defeated on a motion of want of confidence moved
by Mr.  Holder, and he resigned in June 1892. Mr. Playford
married in 1860 Mary Jane, daughter of Rev. William Kinsman.</p>

<p><a name="A1111" id="A1111"></a><b>Plunkett, Hon. John
Hubert</b>, M.L.C., Q.C., was born at Mount Plunkett, co.
Roscommon, in 1802, and educated at Trinity College, Dublin. He was
called to the English Bar, and, being appointed Solicitor-General
of New South Wales, arrived in that colony in June 1832. Five years
later he succeeded Mr. Kinchela as Attorney-General, with a seat in
the Executive and Legislative Councils, and held the post till
responsible government was inaugurated, in 1856. Whilst Government
law-officer he conducted the prosecution of ten Europeans for the
wanton massacre of a number of aboriginal men, women and children,
and secured their conviction, seven of them being hanged&mdash;an event
which created a great sensation, owing to the lax views then
prevalent regarding the killing of natives. At the first election
under responsible government Mr. Plunkett was returned to the
Legislative Assembly for the district of Argyle, but resigned his
seat the next year, when he was nominated to the Legislative
Council, and acted as its President from Jan. 1857 to Feb. 1858. In
the meantime he had been appointed President of the Board of
Education, charged with the duty of carrying out the national
system of public instruction then favoured. Owing to a dispute with
Mr.  Cowper, the then Premier, in connection with the action
of the Board in issuing regulations for bringing non-vested as well
as vested schools within the scope of their operations, his
services were dispensed with under circumstances of great personal
acrimony, in Feb. 1858. He thereupon resigned all his other
appointments, including his membership of the Council, his
presidency of that body, and his commission as a justice of the
peace. The matter was brought under the notice of the Assembly, and
resolutions were carried expressing regret at his removal and the
high sense entertained of his public services. Ultimately the
Government consented to his reinstatement, provided he withdrew a
portion of his correspondence, which they regarded as personally
offensive. He did not, however, resume his position as President of
the Upper House, in which Sir  W. W. Burton  had
succeeded him. From Oct. 1863 to Feb. 1865 Mr. Plunkett represented
the  Martin  Government in the Legislative Council as a
Minister without portfolio. He died in Melbourne on May 9th, 1869,
and was buried in Sydney six days later.</p>

the local Bar. When Victoria was separated from New South Wales,
Mr. Pohlman was gazetted (July 1851) Master in Equity; and in Nov.
following was nominated a member of the partially elective
Legislative Council, then the single Parliamentary chamber. He
acted as chairman of the Board of Education, and was the first

<p><a name="A1113" id="A1113"></a><b>Polding, Most Rev. John
Bede</b>, D.D., first Roman Catholic Archbishop of  Sydney,
N.S.W., and Metropolitan of Australia and Tasmania, was born in
Liverpool, England, on Nov. 18th, 1794, and educated at St.
Gregory's College, Downside. In July 1810 he took the habit of the
Benedictine order, made his religious profession a year later, and
was ordained priest in March 1819. Up to 1834 Australia&mdash;so far as
the Roman Catholic Church was concerned&mdash;was under the episcopal
supervision of the Bishop of Mauritius, who appointed the late
Dr.  Ullathorne  his Vicar-General. In that year it was
decided to create a separate organisation for the administration of
the Antipodean Church, and at its head it was concluded to place
Father Polding, who was made Bishop of Hiero-Caesarea  <i>in
partibus</i>, with the local title of Vicar Apostolic of New
Holland and Van Diemen's Land. This was carried out by a bull of
Pope Gregory XVI., issued in May. In June Dr. Polding was
consecrated, and in Sept. 1835 he arrived in Sydney, where he was
soon busily engaged in laying the basis of the ecclesiastical
organisation which has since so marvellously developed. In 1841 he
visited Rome, and, it having been decided to create an
archiepiscopal see in Sydney, Dr. Polding was appointed the first
Archbishop on April 10th, 1842. He was also created a Count of the
Holy Roman Empire and a Bishop assistant to the Papal throne. The
assumption of the title of Archbishop by Dr. Polding created vast
excitement in Anglican circles in Sydney, and was made the subject
of a solemn public protest by Bishop Broughton, who, in happy
ignorance of the dictum soon to be pronounced by the Privy Council
as to the invalidity of all territorial titles granted by the Crown
to colonial dignitaries subsequent to 1843, formally denounced the
assumption of the title without the royal authority. Like the
Ecclesiastical Titles Bill agitation in England, later on, the
hubbub in the colony soon died away, leaving to each sect the
untrammelled but entirely unofficial choice of the titular
designations of its hierarchy. On three subsequent occasions
Archbishop Polding revisited Europe; and in 1871 he again set forth
to attend the ecumenical Council of the Vatican, summoned to
consider the question of Papal infallibility. He did not, however,
get further than Aden, whence his debilitated health compelled him
to return to Sydney. The Archbishop (who obtained the assistance of
the late Archbishop  Vaughan  as coadjutor in 1873) died
at the Sacred Heart Presbytery, Darlinghurst, Sydney, on March
16th, 1877, his remains being honoured with a public funeral.</p>

<p><a name="A1115" id="A1115"></a><b>Pompallier, Right Rev.
John  Baptist  Francis</b>, first Roman Catholic Bishop
of New Zealand. When the vicar-apostolic of Western Oceania was
created by brief of Pope Gregory XVI. in 1835, search was made
amongst the French clergy for a suitable head of the mission. This
was found in a priest of the diocese of Lyons named Pompallier, and
he was named first vicar-apostolic and Bishop  <i>in
partibus</i>. This ecclesiastic was born in France in Dec. 1802,
and was intended by his friends for the army, but he wished to
become a Jesuit. From this he was dissuaded by the Archbishop of
Paris, but, following his religious bent, he took orders as a
secular priest, and became one of the founders of the Marist
Congregation, which took its rise amongst a few secular priests in
the dioceses of Lyons and Bellay. Francis Pompallier became
novice-master of the order, and three hundred novices passed
through his hands. When, on June 30th, 1836, Pompallier was
consecrated at Rome Bishop of Maronée and first Vicar-Apostolic of
Western Oceania, the infant society of which he was so prominent
a  member came into notice at the Vatican, and he obtained a
brief authorising the erection of the new society, to be called,
after the Blessed Virgin, the Society of Mary, and having for its
especial object the evangelisation of the islands of Western
Oceania. Having recruited six priests and three lay brethren for
his projected mission, the Bishop and his co-workers sailed from
Havre in the  <i>Delphine</i>  on Dec. 24th, 1836, bound
for Valparaiso, which they regarded as affording the best route to
the islands of Oceania. They reached Valparaiso in June 1837, and
were compelled to remain there two months before they found an
American vessel&mdash;the  <i>Europa</i>&mdash;going to the Sandwich
Islands by way of Gambier and Tahiti. The party arrived at the
latter island on Sept. 20th, 1837, and here the American consul
placed at their service a schooner of sixty tons burden, called
the  <i>Raiatea</i>, in which they left Tahiti for the
Sandwich Islands on Oct. 4th, 1837. After looking in at Vavau, one
of the Friendly Islands, the party called in at Wallis and Fortuna
islands, in each case leaving a priest and catechist behind them to
evangelise the natives, who, unlike those of Vavau, had not fallen
under Protestant influences. On Dec. 9th, 1837, the Bishop reached
Sydney, N.S.W., where he was the guest of Archbishop  Polding,
who then held the Church's commission as Vicar-Apostolic of New
Holland. The  <i>Raiatea</i>  once more set sail towards
its now nearing destination at the end of the month, and reached
Hokianga, the northernmost port on the west coast of the North
Island of New Zealand, after a twelve days' passage; the party, now
reduced to the Bishop and a priest and lay brother, disembarking on
Jan. 10th, 1838, after over twelve months of inexpressibly tedious
and toilsome travelling. The missionaries were welcomed by an
Irishman named Poynton, and took up their abode in a wooden house,
of which they turned the largest room into a chapel, and in which,
on Jan. 13th, 1839, they celebrated what was probably the first
mass said in New Zealand. Hokianga was then the headquarters of the
Wesleyan Mission, and at first the Mangamuka natives seemed
inclined to expel "the Papists" and destroy their crucifixes and
images. Ultimately, however, they were brought to kindlier
dispositions, more probably as the result of Bishop Pompallier's
reasonings than in consequence of a manifesto issued on the
missionaries' behalf by the eccentric  Baron de Thierry
(<i>q.v.</i>), who stood loyally to his fellow-countrymen. The
Bishop was now much crippled for money, and was greatly relieved
when supplies and three more priests arrived from France in June
1839. He now made his headquarters forty miles away at Kororarika,
in the Bay of Islands, which soon became the centre of a successful
mission. Captain Hobson, the first English governor of New Zealand,
arrived in Jan. 1840, and was met by Bishop Pompallier, who
demanded a declaration of toleration for his mission and converts.
This was promised, and on Feb. 6th Captain Hobson met the principal
Maori chiefs at the immortal trysting-place close to where the
Waitangi river falls into the sea. At this conference Bishop
Pompallier attended in full canonicals, much to the disgust of his
Protestant rivals, who charged him (as did Governor Hobson) with
prompting the chiefs, who demurred to signing the famous document
now put before then, and known in history as the "Waitangi treaty."
The Queen's sovereignty was formally proclaimed in May 1840, not
greatly, as it may be imagined, to the satisfaction of Bishop
Pompallier, who, however, made the best of the situation. In July
1841 he visited Auckland, and obtained grants of land from the
Government for a church site and cemetery. After the destruction of
Kororarika in 1845, he made Auckland, of which he was
vicar-apostolic and virtually bishop, his headquarters; and it
remained so to the close of his episcopate. In 1849, when on a
visit to Europe, he visited Carlow in Ireland, and took out a
detachment of Sisters of Mercy under Mother Cecilia Maher,
afterwards well known in New Zealand. After thirty-three years of
labour, during which he is said to have baptised 10,000 savages,
Bishop Pompallier obtained leave to retire, and was raised by the
Holy See to the dignity of Archbishop of Amasia  <i>in
partibus</i>  He subsequently returned to France, where he
died on Dec. 20th, 1870.</p>

<p><a name="A1116" id="A1116"></a><b>Potatau</b>  (Te Whero
Whero), the first so-called "Maori king," was a high-born chief of
the Waikato, North Island of New  Zealand. He narrowly escaped
slaughter at the hands of Hongi at Matakitaki in 1822. In 1831 Te
Whero Whero, as he was then called, led an immense war party
against the Taranaki Maoris and killed many hundreds of the
Ngatiawa tribe, whose lands more than ten years later he claimed by
right of conquest. In 1844 Te Whero Whero was the prominent figure
at a great feast of the Waikato tribe given at Remuera, near
Auckland, with the view mainly of impressing Governor
Fitzroy  with the power of the Northern Maoris. He was
subsequently received at Government House, Auckland, and treated
with great distinction by Fitzroy. In 1847 he wrote with other
chiefs to the Queen to insist upon the observance of the
stipulations of the  treaty of Waitangi  in regard to the
inviolability of native lands, which had been ignored in a despatch
of Earl Grey, the Colonial Secretary, to Sir  George Grey, the
then Governor of the colony. In reply Earl Grey completely changed
his tone and assured the chiefs that her Majesty had directed that
the treaty should be religiously and scrupulously observed. In
1857  Wiremu Tamihana, known as the kingmaker, issued a
circular "to all Waikato" proposing the appointment of Potatau, as
he was now called, to the kingship of New Zealand, this move being
taken as a counterblast to the growing authority of the Queen of
England, which it was hoped it would neutralise. Potatau
unwillingly accepted the nomination, and claimed only the title of
"Matua, father." Ultimately, however, he took up a more aggressive,
though always calm and dignified, attitude. He died on June 25th,
1860, and was succeeded by his son  Tawhiao
(<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

in 1876, and in 1881 was elected alderman of Maryborough and mayor
in 1883. In 1886 Mr. Powers became a member of the Burrum
Divisional Board, and assisted largely in developing the Burrum
coalfields and the northern coal trade. In 1887 he went to London
and formed the Isis Investment Company. He was elected member of
the Legislative Assembly for the Burrum District at the general
election in 1888, and was appointed a member of the
Morehead  Ministry, without portfolio, on Sept. 20th, 1889. On
Nov. 19th in the same year he succeeded Mr.  Donaldson

(Rosa Caroline Murray-Prior), was born at Bromelton, on the Logan
river, Queensland, on March 27th, 1851, and is the daughter of
Hon.  T. L. Murray-Prior, M.L.C., and Matilda his first wife,
daughter of Thomas Harpur, of Cecil Hills, N.S.W. Miss Murray-Prior
was educated mainly at Brisbane, and previous to her marriage saw a
great deal of the social and political life of Queensland, which
she has utilised so effectively in her various novels. On
August  29th, 1872, she married Arthur Campbell Bulkley
Mackworth Praed, son of a banker in Fleet Street, London, and
nephew of the poet  Winthrop Mackworth Praed. Mr. and Mrs.
Campbell Praed lived at their station on Curtis Island, Qd., until
1876, when they came to London. In 1880 she published her first
novel, "An Australian Heroine," which has been followed in rapid
succession by a number of works of fiction, many of which are
thoroughly Australian in character; such as "Policy and Passion,"
(or "Longleat of Kooralbyn"); "Moloch"; "The Head Station";
"Affinities"; "Australian Life"; "Black and White"; "Miss
Jacobsen's Chance"; "The Bond of Wedlock" (subsequently dramatised
by the author, and produced by Mrs. Bernard Beere, under the name
of the heroine,  <i>Ariane</i>); "The Brother of the Shadow,"
"The Soul of Countess Adrian." In addition Mrs. Campbell Praed has
collaborated with Mr.  Justin McCarthy, M.P., and produced a
series of novels dealing mainly with English political and social
life, but some parts of which are distinctly Australian, and
evidently from her pen. These are "The Right Honourable"; "The
Ladies' Gallery"; and the "Rival Princess." Mrs. Campbell Praed is
generally recognised as the most brilliant and successful of
Australian novelists. Her descriptions of the scenery of her native
land are unsurpassed; and Australians cannot be blamed for thinking
her work, which  deals with the life, character and scenes of
Queensland, to be of a higher and more enduring kind than the
descriptions of London ephemeral fashions, social, political or
religions, which she occasionally essays. Some few years ago Mrs.
Campbell Praed paid a visit to the United States, and subsequently
wrote a series of articles on her transatlantic experiences
in  <i>Temple Bar</i>. She has frequently written for the
magazines, English and American, and has been a contributor to the
series of short stories written by "Australians in London," from
"Oak-Bough and Wattle-Blossom" (1888) to  Cooëe" (1891).</p>

in which year he performed distinguished service in Holland, and in
China in 1841. In Jan. 1860 he succeeded Mr E. Macarthur in the

and in the summer of that year proceeded to New Zealand to conduct
the operations against the Maories. After a fairly successful
campaign he gave up the local command to General Cameron, and left
New Zealand in April 1861 to reassume bis Australian command. In
1862 Sir Thomas, who was sometime adjutant-general at Madras, was
appointed to the colonelcy of the 37th Regiment, and retired from
the active list in 1878 with the rank of lieut.-general. He
married, in 1827, Frances Agnes, daughter of John S. Cooper. Sir
Thomas was made K.C.B. in 1861, and was publicly invested with the
ribbon and badge of the Order of the Bath by Sir Henry Barkly,

College to study for the ministry of the Congregational Church. He
was ordained in 1832, and sailed with his wife for Hobart. He
preached in Launceston from August 1832 to Jan. 1833, when he was
invited to the charge of Pitt Street Chapel, Sydney. Mr. Price
opened this chapel on Feb. 13th, 1833, and became the first
minister of this the first church of the Congregational
denomination in Australia. After acting for some time as resident
minister at Port Stephens, N.S.W., he returned in 1836 to
Launceston. Here he accepted the charge of Tamar Street
Congregational Chapel, the pulpit of which he occupied till his
death in 1891.</p>

June 12th, 1838, Mary,  eldest daughter  of Major
Franklin, of 1st Royal Cavalry. He went to Van Diemen's Land in
1835, and employed himself in agricultural pursuits. Subsequently
he joined the Government service, and showed great daring in the
detection and capture of bushrangers. In 1838 he was appointed
police magistrate at Hobart Town, and ten years later succeeded
Captain Maconochie as  Chief Superintendent of the convict
settlement at Norfolk Island. Captain Maconochie had relaxed
discipline and preached the gospel of kindness. This was totally
foreign to Mr. Price's idea of convict management, and he gained a
reputation for severity which always followed him. The chaplains
who denounced him as cruel he dismissed, and gave the same short
shrift to the officials who would have preferred milder measures.
In 1853 he was appointed Chief Inspector of Convict Establishments
in Victoria, and continued to show himself an inflexible
disciplinarian. On March 26th, 1857, he was pelted with stones and
masses of rock by eighty-two of the convicts employed on the jetty
at Williamstown, near Melbourne, and died the next day from the
injuries he received. Several of the ringleaders in the attack were

and turned his attention to water colours, in which he was mainly
self-taught. In conjunction with Mr. Müller, he published in 1836
"The Antiquities of Bristol," in which city he resided for a number
of years. He went to Sydney in 1840, and followed his art with good
results, several of his water colours being still in the local
galleries. In 1845 Mr. Prout visited Tasmania, and subsequently
issued his "Tasmania Illustrated" in four series. Mr. Prout
returned to England in 1850 and became a member of the Institute of
Painters in Water Colours, at whose exhibitions he was represented
till his death on August 29th, 1876, at Camden Town, near London.
After his return from Australia he wrote to the artistic
periodicals on the development of Australian art. He also exhibited
his Australian sketches at the Crystal Palace.</p>

<p><a name="A1126" id="A1126"></a><b>Pugh, Theophilus Parsons</b>,

College, Taunton. He joined the staff of the  <i>Southern
Times</i>  at Weymouth in 1852, after a short apprenticeship
to the printing business, and was afterwards attached to the
<i>Mirror</i>  at Salisbury and the  <i>Herald</i>
at Swansea. In 1855 he emigrated to Australia, arriving in Moreton
Bay in June of that year. Mr. Pugh acted as local correspondent for
Sir  Henry Parkes' paper, the  <i>Empire</i>  of
Sydney, and was editor of the Moreton Bay  <i>Free
Press</i>  from Oct. 1855 to Oct. 1859. When Mr. T. B.
Stephens bought the Moreton Bay  <i>Courier</i>, then a
bi-weekly paper, in 1859, Mr. Pugh accepted the editorship, and
brought it out as a tri-weekly in November, and as a daily in May
1861. After leaving what is now the Brisbane
<i>Courier</i>  in 1863, Mr. Pugh went into various
journalistic ventures, becoming editor of the Brisbane
<i>Telegraph</i>, then newly started, in Oct. 1872. This post he
resigned in Nov. 1873. Pugh's "Moreton Bay (Sheet) Almanack for
1858" appeared at the end of 1857, followed by the first book
almanack for 1859 in 1858. These developed into the now well-known
publication, Pugh's "Queensland Almanack" in 1860, which has been
published continuously ever since, with  constantly increasing
usefulness and popularity. Mr. Pugh became secretary of the
committee formed for the purpose of obtaining the separation of
Queensland from New South Wales, on the retirement of Mr. William
Wilkes in 1857, until the purpose of the movement was achieved in
1859. On Dec. 10th, 1859, Mr. Pugh issued the first Queensland
Government  <i>Gazette</i>, and continued to print and publish
it until the appointment of Mr. Belbridge as the first Government
printer. In May 1863 he was elected to represent North Brisbane in
the second parliament, was re-elected for the city in June 1867,
became chairman of committees in September, and was again returned
in 1868, but almost immediately afterwards retired from
parliamentary life. Mr. Pugh was appointed police magistrate at
Goondiwindi in 1874, for Rockhampton in 1876, for Warwick in 1882,

John</b>, when a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, went to South
Australia as one of Colonel Light's Survey Staff, arriving in the
colony in August 1836. He was employed in exploring and surveying
the mouth of the Murray river, and may be regarded as the
discoverer of Port Adelaide, into which he sailed on Sept. 28th,
1836, three months before the arrival of the first Governor. He
also surveyed Port Elliot, and did much to elucidate the geography
of the South Australian coast. Returning to England, he sailed, In
June 1849, with one of the Franklin search expeditions, and
remained two years and a half with the fur traders of the Hudson's
Bay Company, returning home via Northern America in Oct. 1851. The
next year he explored Davis Straits, Lancaster Sound and Beachy
Isle, and was icebound for two years. Goolwa was originally called
Port Pullen, but the former name was, for some reason, substituted.
He died on Jan. 22nd, 1887.</p>

in 1844 at Burslem, Staffordshire, his father being a Baptist
minister. Mr. Pulsford was for many years occupied with mercantile
affairs in Hull. In 1883 he decided to settle in Australia, and
chose the colony of New South Wales on account of its free trade
policy. He arrived in Sydney early in 1884, and has since resided
there. Within a few weeks of his arrival he wrote a small work
entitled "Thoughts and Suggestions on the Commerce and Progress of
New South Wales," which was published and distributed by the Sydney
Chamber of Commerce. In 1885, in consequence of a protectionist
agitation, the Free Trade Association of New South Wales was
formed, and Mr. Pulsford was appointed the secretary. By his
pamphlets, papers, letters to the press, and public addresses, he
is considered to have been largely instrumental in maintaining the
free trade policy of the colony. He was for some time commercial
editor of the Sydney  <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and has lately
become the proprietor of the  <i>Armidale Chronicle</i>, one
of the leading country newspapers in New South Wales.</p>

Q.C., the eminent Victorian advocate, is the eldest son of the late
James Purves, one of the pioneers of the colony of Victoria, and
was born in Swanston Street, Melbourne, on August 23rd, 1843. He
was educated in the first instance at Mr. Budd's school and at the
Melbourne Diocesan Grammar School, but went to Europe in 1855 with
his father, and passed through a course of instruction at various
English and foreign schools. He also studied at King's College,
London, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, to which he went up in
1859. He entered at Lincoln's Inn in April 1861, and was called to
the English Bar in June 1865. Shortly afterwards he returned to
Victoria, where he was admitted to the local Bar, and commenced the
career as an advocate which has given him the foremost position,
not only in Melbourne, but throughout Australia. Of recent years no
Victorian  <i>cause célèbre</i>  has been complete
without his retention on one side or the other. In March 1872 Mr.
Purves entered Parliament as a Constitutionalist and Free-trader
for the constituency of Mornington, in the representation of which
he succeeded Sir  James M?Culloch, and sat till 1880. In the
interim he refused offers of office from the first
Berry  and the last M?Culloch Administration. Mr. Purves,
though mainly devoted to his profession, has taken a prominent part
in the proceedings of the Victorian Natives Association, and holds
national Australian views nearly as advanced as those of Sir
Charles Lilley, the Chief Justice of Queensland.</p>

<p><a name="A1130" id="A1130"></a><b>Pyke, Hon. Vincent</b>, was
born in Somersetshire, England, on Feb. 4th, 1827, and went to
South Australia in 1851. He soon, however, left that colony for the
Victorian goldfields, where he worked as a miner for two years with
varying success at Forest Creek, Castlemaine, and Fryer's Creek,
Bendigo. In 1853 he took to storekeeping at Fryer's Creek, and
having made himself prominent as an opponent of the unpopular
diggers' licences, was elected in 1855 to represent the Mount
Alexander goldfields in the semi-representative Legislative Council
which was then the sole parliamentary chamber. He was one of the
earliest supporters of the ballot, which was adopted by the
Council. Responsible government having been conceded, Mr. Pyke was
returned in 1856 to the first Legislative Assembly for Castlemaine,
and in the following year was appointed emigration agent in England
in conjunction with the Right Hon.  H. C. E. Childers.
Returning to Victoria at the end of 1858, Mr. Pyke was appointed
warden and police magistrate at Sandhurst, a position he held for
eighteen months, when he resigned and was re-elected for
Castlemaine. On the fall of the  O'Shanassy  Ministry in
Oct. 1859 Mr. Pyke accepted office under Mr.  Nicholson
as Commissioner of Trade and Customs. This post he held till Oct.
1860, when he was transferred to the position of Vice-President of
the Board of Land and Works and Commissioner of Public Works. He
also for a few weeks in Sept. 1860 discharged the functions of
Minister of Lands in succession to Mr.  Service. In the
following November he resigned with his colleagues. In 1862, whilst
still a member of the Victorian Parliament, he visited New Zealand
with the view of inspecting the Tuapeka goldfields in Otago. Whilst
in Dunedin he was offered and accepted the post of head of the
goldfields department under the Otago Provincial Government. In
this capacity he organised the department and prepared regulations
for its guidance and working, being thus in large measure the
father of goldfields legislation in New Zealand, the Goldfields Act
of 1866 being drafted by him. He held the office of Secretary of
Goldfields till 1867, when it was abolished, owing to a dispute
between the Colonial and Provincial Governments as to their
respective powers under the Goldfields Act. Mr. Pyke was then
successively warden and resident magistrate of the Dunstan and
Tuapeka districts. In 1873 he resigned his magisterial post, and
was returned to the New Zealand House of Representatives for
Wakatipu. In 1875 he transferred his services to the Dunstan
district, but was thrown out of Parliament in 1890. Mr. Pyke, who
resides at Dunedin, has published a number of works of fiction,
principally illustrative of gold-digging life.</p>

father, who settled at Bendigo (Sandhurst). He was brought up to
engineering, and then became a compositor. Later on he was an
engine-driver in a mine. From the typographical department he
subsequently advanced to the literary, and, having learned
short-hand, was a reporter first on the  <i>Bendigo
Independent</i>  and afterwards on the  <i>Bendigo

the  <i>Age</i>, studying meanwhile at the Melbourne
University, where he graduated B.A. in Dec. 1877. The next year he
became law reporter on the  <i>Age</i>  and was admitted
to the Victorian Bar in June. Having in the meantime become leader
of the  <i>Age</i>  parliamentary reporting staff, he in
July 1880 contested Sandhurst for a seat in the Assembly, and was
returned, defeating Mr. John McIntyre. He then resigned his
position on the Age. In June 1882 he took the degree of LL.D. at
Melbourne University, and in Feb. of the next year was re-elected
for Sandhurst. In March he was offered a seat in the
Service-Berry  coalition Cabinet, but declined to accept
office, though, it  is remarkable, three other former members
of the  <i>Age</i>  staff took portfolios, viz., Messrs.
Deakin, Dow, and Pearson. In 1883 Dr. Quick published a "History of
Land Tenure in Victoria." At the general election in 1886 he was

subsequently attended law classes in Edinburgh, gaining a prize of
£20 in 1837 for a literary essay. In Dec. 1839 he arrived in
Sydney, having accepted the post of secretary and accountant to the
North British Australasian Loan and Investment Company. In 1842 he
wrote the letterpress for "Sydney Illustrated," and in July 1843

with the 72nd Highlanders in the Crimean war, and was present at
the siege and fall of Sebastopol for which he received a medal with
clasp, and the Turkish war medal. In the New Zealand war of
1860-61 he served with the 1st battalion of the 12th Regiment of

and 1864. General Richardson, who holds the New Zealand war medal,
became captain in 1863, and, retiring from the Imperial service,
was in 1865 appointed to the command of the military forces of New
South Wales, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, becoming colonel
in 1876 and major-general in 1885, when he commanded the New South
Wales contingent despatched to co-operate with the British forces

1852, and was for some time in the Roads and Bridges department of
the Government service. After spending a year or two in Sydney, he,
in 1854, settled as a farmer in the Creswick district of Victoria.
In 1874 he entered the Assembly as member for Creswick, and held
the seat till 1886, when he was defeated at the general election.
He was, however, re-elected when the district was subdivided in
1889 as the representative of the Creswick section. Mr. Richardson,

1844, being called to the bar in Jan. 1847. After practising in
England, Judge Richmond emigrated to New Zealand in 1853, and was
appointed Provincial Solicitor for Taranaki, becoming a member of
the House of Representatives two years later. In June 1856 he
joined the first Stafford Ministry; and between that date
and July 1861, when the Government broke up, was constantly being
shifted from position to position in the Cabinet, being first
Colonial Secretary, then Colonial Treasurer, then Minister of
Native Affairs, then Commissioner of Customs, then a member of the
Executive Council without portfolio, then again Colonial Treasurer,
and finally Commissioner of Customs for the second time. Having led
the Opposition to the succeeding Fox Ministry for a
single session, Judge Richmond retired from political life, and
resumed the practice of his profession, being appointed a Puisne
Judge in Oct. 1862. As a Minister Mr. Richmond had but scant
sympathy with the intricacies of Maori territorial rights, his
constant aim being to convert them into English freeholds. He also
abetted and encouraged Governor Browne's policy in the ill-fated
purchase of the Waitara block, which drove the Maoris into war in
1860.</p>

Provincial Secretary under Superintendent Cutfield, in which
capacity he approved Governor Browne's action in the purchase of
the Waitara block, which led to the outbreak of the Taranaki war.
During the struggle his farm and house were destroyed, and he
removed to Nelson, where he conducted the <i>Nelson
Examiner</i>. Meantime he served as a volunteer in the operations
against the Maoris, and as an inspector of the defences. Having
been returned to the House of Representatives, he was Colonial
Secretary in the Weld Ministry from June to Oct. 1865 and
Commissioner of Customs and Stamp Duties in
the Stafford Government from August 1866 to June 1868. He
has been in the Legislative Council since 1883. [On July 7th, 1892,

Brunswick, from 1838 to 1840, when he was appointed Commissioner
for examining and reporting on claims to grants of land in New
Zealand. While he was engaged on this duty the "Wairau massacre"
occurred, and he was despatched to establish order and confidence.
In 1843 Mr. Richmond was police magistrate of the southern division
of New Ulster (now called North Island) and Cook Straits,
superintendent of the southern division of New Zealand in 1844, and
superintendent and resident magistrate at Nelson in 1846. On June
23rd, 1853, he was nominated a member of the Legislative
Council by the Governor, Sir George Grey, and in May 1860 he
was created C.B., with an expression of Her Majesty's approbation
of the services rendered by him to the Crown. Mr. Richmond was
Chairman of Committees of the Legislative Council from 1865 to

M.A., was born at Hartford End, Essex, Sept. 14th, 1819, and
educated at King's College and the University of London. He arrived
in Sydney with Dr. Lang in 1850, and became a Presbyterian minister
and Professor of Greek, Latin and Hebrew in the Australian College.
He took pastoral charge at Portland Bay, Brisbane, and the Manning
River; and subsequently devoted himself to missionary work amongst
the aborigines. Returning to Sydney, he was connected with the
Empire until its discontinuance; and for the last five years of his
life he was chief editor of the <i>Evening News</i>, and a
regular contributor to the <i>Town and Country Journal</i>. In
1877, at the request of the Presbyterian Synod, he acquired the
Chinese language, in order to take charge of the Chinese Mission in
Sydney. The work by which he will be principally remembered is that
on the Kamilaroi and other native dialects, which was printed at
the expense of the Government, and is highly esteemed by
ethnologists and philologists. Mr. Ridley, who married Miss
Isabella Cotter, died on Sept. 27th, 1878.</p>

<p><a name="A1168" id="A1168"></a><b>Rignold, George</b>, the

Blaxland Rignold, was an actress, and played with Macready and
Phelps. George Rignold was not originally intended for the stage.
He first entered the musical profession, and played in the
orchestra of a provincial theatre; but eventually he began his
dramatic career at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham. Mr. Rignold made
his most important success in <i>Henry the Fifth</i>; but his
name is intimately connected with Lord
Clancarty, <i>Cromwell</i>, <i>Harold</i>, <i>The
White Pilgrim</i>, Caliban in <i>The Tempest</i>, <i>Amos
Clarke</i>, Mephistopheles in <i>Faust</i>, Marc Antony
in <i>Julius Caesar</i>, and Bottom in <i>The Midsummer
Night's Dream</i>. After Mr. Rignold had gained a London
reputation, he went to America in 1876, and secured great
popularity. From the United States he went to Australia, played a
star engagement, and entered into active management with the late
Mr. James Allison at Adelaide. Paying a visit to England, he
played <i>Henry the Fifth</i> at Drury Lane, and again
went to Australia, where for the last seven years he has held a
leading position as an actor-manager. In Nov. 1887 Mr. Rignold
opened Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney (of which he has since been
lessee and manager) with <i>Henry the Fifth</i>. Since then he
has produced, amongst other plays, <i>Julius
Caesar</i>, <i>The Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, <i>Antony
and Cleopatra</i>, and a local version of
Goethe's <i>Faust</i>. Mrs. George Rignold, who has now
abandoned the stage, was an attractive actress, and appeared in
Australia during her husband's earlier colonial career; while Mr.
William Rignold, an admirable English character actor, brother of
the above, has recently gone to Australia, where, in addition to
his own well-known type of modern character, he has made quite a
sensation by his remarkable performance of Falstaff in <i>The
Merry Wives of Windsor</i>.</p>

Hebrew Society, of which he became principal. In 1848 he occupied
the office of minister to the newly established Jewish congregation
in Melbourne, but resigned this charge, and was invited to assist
in the formation of a new synagogue in the Victorian metropolis. In
1864, mainly through his exertions, a duly constituted Beth Din
(Hebrew court of justice), the only one out of London, was
established, of which he acted as chairman. In 1868 the Chief Rabbi
of Great Britain and its dependencies assigned to him the position
of Senior Minister of the Melbourne Hebrew community. He died on

Tory of the old school. He is best known for his unsuccessful
attempt to induce the old Legislative Council to impose a royalty
on copper, and for his, for the time, successful attempt to
subsidise the various religious bodies. The latter policy was
contrary to the principles on which the colony was founded, and was
repealed in 1851, so soon as the elective element was introduced
into the Legislative Council. General Robe was recalled in August
1848, and he returned to England, where he died on April 4th,

1837, and educated at Carshalton Military School and the Royal
Academy, Woolwich. He entered the Royal Artillery in 1855, became
captain in 1862 and major in 1863. He served in the Crimean
campaign in 1855-6, during which he was twice wounded, and received
a medal with clasp, the Turkish medal, and the Sardinian order of
Military Valour, and and was personally commended for his conduct
on June 18th, 1855, by Lord Raglan. He was in command of the
artillery with the field force in Sikkim, in 1861, for which he was
thanked in general orders, and by the Governor-General of India in
Council, and was made captain and subsequently brevet-major. He was
aide-de-camp to Sir John Young when Governor of New South Wales
from 1866 to 1867. Colonel Roberts retired from the Royal Artillery
in 1871, and was secretary to the Agent-General for New South Wales
from 1872 to 1874. He was appointed Colonel in command of the New
South Wales artillery in 1876, and second in command of the forces,
being created C.M.G. in June 1885. Colonel Roberts married in 1866
Alice, daughter of the late William Bradley, of Goulburn, N.S.W. In
1890 he visited England, and was commissioned by the New South
Wales Government to inquire into all military matters likely to be
suggestive of improvements in the colonial forces. In 1892, when it
was decided to establish a separate department of defence under the
Colonial Secretary, Col. Roberts was appointed the first

Institution in that city. In 1868 he went to New Zealand, and was
President of the Dunedin Chamber of Commerce in 1887 and of the New
Zealand and South Seas Exhibition held at Dunedin in 1889-90, in
which latter year he was Mayor of Dunedin. Mr. Roberts married in
1870 Louisa Jane, daughter of the late Charles Henry Keale, of
Dunedin. He was created C.M.G. in 1891.</p>

<p><a name="A1175" id="A1175"></a><b>Robertson, Hon. Sir John</b>,
K.C.M.G., is of Scotch extraction, and was born at Bow, Essex, on
Oct 15th, 1816. His father emigrated to New South Wales with his
family in 1820, and the future Premier was educated under Dr. Lang
and Messrs. Gilchrist and Cape. Mr. Robertson, sen., went into
grazing on the Hunter river, and thither the family removed in
1835. In the meantime the subject of this notice had revisited
England, working his passage home as one of the crew of the
ship <i>Sovereign</i>. After two years' experience of the sea,
during which he visited some of the principal ports of Europe,
Brazil and South America, he returned to Sydney, and was engaged in
pastoral and farming pursuits in the northern districts of the
colony for a number of years. Though on various occasions he made
himself prominent as the champion of the interests of
his fellow-squatters, Mr. Robertson's Liberalism in his early
days was of a very pronounced type. He was returned to the first
Legislative Assembly elected under the present bicameral system in
1856 for the district of Phillip, Brisbane and Bligh. The programme
to which he pledged himself embraced manhood suffrage, vote by
ballot, the division of the electoral districts on a population
basis, the abolition of State aid to religion, national education,
and free selection over the public lands of the colony. All of them
have since been embodied in the statute law of the colony, and
several of them mainly through his instrumentality. Mr. Robertson
took office in the second Cowper Ministry as Secretary for Lands
and Public Works in Jan. 1858, and in the following February issued
regulations providing that all future pastoral leases granted
should be issued subject to whatever conditions subsequent
legislation might impose. This effectually prevented the creation
of fresh vested interests to block the path of land reform. Their
education policy proving unacceptable, the Ministry resigned; but
in March 1860 Mr. Robertson became Premier of the colony, with his
former portfolio as Minister of Lands, Mr. Cowper (who had
temporarily retired from Parliament) taking office under him as
Colonial Secretary. True to his previous pledges, he at once
introduced a Land Bill embodying the principle of free selection
over the public land, <i>whether surveyed or unsurveyed</i>.
An amendment moved by Mr. (now Sir) John Hay, limiting the
popular choice to lands previously surveyed, being carried in the
Assembly, Mr. Robertson appealed to the country, and came back with
a large majority. The Upper House being still regarded as hostile,
Mr. Robertson took the bold and chivalrous course of resigning his
seat in the Assembly, and accepting a nomination to the Legislative
Council, with the view of himself piloting his pet measure through
the breakers which threatened to wreck its progress in the
squatters' stronghold. This was in Jan. 1861, and involved his
transferring the premiership to Mr. Cowper. As Minister of
Lands he triumphed over the prejudices of the Upper House, and
secured the passage of his measure, of which all subsequent land
legislation has been an expansion. Before the Cowper-Robertson
Ministry resigned in Oct. 1863 they had effectuated another point
in the latter's programme by passing an Act to abolish State aid to
religion. Mr. Robertson was once more Secretary for Lands for a few
months in Mr. Cowper's fourth Government in 1865 and 1866. In the
latter year he assisted his political opponents in carrying the
Public Schools Act introduced by Mr. (now Sir) Henry Parkes.
In Oct. 1868 Mr. Robertson formed his second Cabinet, acting as
Premier and Colonial Secretary until Jan. 1870, when he transferred
these offices to Mr. Cowper, under whom he served as Minister of
Lands from August to December of the above year. In
the Martin Ministry, which succeeded, he was Colonial
Secretary from the latter date till May 1872. He formed his third
Cabinet in Feb. 1875, and held office till March 1877. Another
Parkes Ministry intervened, and Mr. Robertson was Premier for the
fourth time from August to Dec. 1877, in which year he was created
K.C.M.G. The public now became disgusted by the paucity of
legislation, which they attributed to the personal rivalries
between Sir John Robertson and Sir Henry Parkes; and at the general
election in Dec. 1877 this view of the case was indicated pretty
palpably by the simultaneous rejection of the former for West
Sydney and of the latter for East Sydney. Both, however, quickly
found alternative seats; but they took the hint, and after a short
interval formed a Coalition Ministry, which held office for the
unusual period of four years&mdash;viz., from Dec. 1878 to Jan. 1883.
The arrangement come to was facilitated by the fact that Sir John
Robertson had resigned his seat in the Assembly a short time
previously, on failing to form a Government when that of
Mr. Farnell was defeated. Thus, whilst Sir Henry Parkes
conducted Government business in the Assembly, Sir John, who was
nominated to the Upper House for the purpose, represented the
Government in that Chamber as Vice-President of the Executive
Council. During Sir Henry Parkes' absence in England, from Dec.
1881 to August 1882, Sir John supplied his place as Colonial
Secretary; and was also for a short time Minister of Public
Instruction, and latterly of Lands, in the joint Cabinet. In Dec
1885 Sir John formed his fifth and last Administration, and
was Premier and Colonial Secretary till Feb. 1886, when he was
displaced by Sir Patrick Jennings. Shortly afterwards he retired
from public life, the Legislature voting him £10,000 for his
lifelong public services. Sir John was utterly opposed to the
Federation policy fathered by Sir Henry Parkes, and denounced his
former colleague with characteristic vigour. He married, in 1837,
Margaret Emma, daughter of J. J. Davies, of Clovelly, Watson's Bay,
Sydney, who died in August 1889. Sir John Robertson died in Sydney
on May 8th, 1891.</p>

<p><a name="A1175a" id="A1175a"></a><b>Robertson, William</b>,
B.A., was the second son of the late William Robertson, who went to
Victoria from Tasmania in 1812, and purchased the Colac estate from
the late Captain Foster Fyans. Mr. Robertson, sen., was for many
years engaged in pastoral pursuits at Campbelltown, between Hobart
and Launceston, and he afterwards entered into business as a
merchant in Hobart, where his son William was born in the year
1839. The latter received his education at the High School in
Hobart and at Wadham College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in
1861. He was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in Jan. 1863.
While at Oxford he rowed in the Oxford and Cambridge annual boat
race on the Thames in 1861, and was one of the winning crew, being
the first of several young Australians who have taken part in the
great inter-university race. The oar used on that occasion,
converted into a trophy of the victory and appropriately mounted
and inscribed, was always in after-life one of Mr. Robertson's
proudest possessions. In 1863 he returned to Victoria, where he was
admitted to the Bar in the following year. For several years Mr.
Robertson practised as a barrister in Melbourne, but he never
exerted himself to any great extent in that direction. At the
General Election of 1871 he became a candidate for the electorate
of Polwarth and South Grenville, and was returned by a large
majority, but when the Parliament expired in 1872 he did not offer
himself for re-election. He, however, again stood in 1881, and sat
till 1886. In Jan. 1874 occurred the death of Mr. William
Robertson, sen., and the Colac estate was by his will divided among
his four surviving sons. John, the eldest, received that portion of
the estate since known as Cororoke; George Pringle had Coragulac;
James took Glen Alvie; while to William fell Kerangemorrah, better
known as The Hill, a stretch of very rich agricultural and grazing
land about four miles from Colac. John Robertson died within two or
three years of his father, and the death of James occurred in July
1890, and the estate of each was sold. Mr. G. P. Robertson is
therefore now the only surviving son of the old Colac pioneer, and
for many years his Coragulac estate has been leased to others. Mr.
William Robertson also disposed of a large portion of his estate,
but retained the ownership of a magnificent stretch of land
surrounding The Hill. In 1886 the resignation of the late
Mr.&nbsp;C. J. Jenner&nbsp;caused a vacancy in the representation
of the South-western Province in the Legislative Council, and Mr.
Robertson was returned without opposition. In 1888 he obtained
leave of absence for the purpose of making another trip to the old
country, and upon his term of office expiring in the same year he
retired finally from Parliamentary work. For some years after the
death of Mr. William Robertson, sen., the combined property was
worked by the brothers in partnership, and the firm of Robertson
Brothers became famous throughout Australia for the great annual
sales of shorthorn cattle which were initiated. The herd had been
commenced by Mr. Robertson, sen., at least a quarter of a century
before, and he spared neither time nor money to procure some of the
best strains of blood then extant. The stock had been kept
perfectly pure, and in 1875 the brothers began a series of annual
drafts from their herd, which were submitted at auction year by
year and realised almost fabulous prices. On each occasion
stock-breeders flocked to Colac from all the Australian colonies,
New Zealand, and Tasmania. At one sale the prices paid aggregated
upwards of £30,000, and at another the total receipts were £25,800.
On one occasion the firm purchased from the estate of the late Mr.
Richard Morton thirty-seven prime shorthorns, known previously as
the Mount Derrimut herd, for £27,000, the sum of £2,500 being paid
for one of the bulls: Oxford Cherry Duke. The last sale of the
regular series took place in 1884, and in 1885 the famous "F.F."
herd was dispersed, owing to the dissolution of the partnership
which had till then subsisted between Messrs. Robertson Brothers
and the executors of the late Mr. John Robertson, the surviving
brothers having decided to confine their&nbsp;attention almost
exclusively to sheep-breeding. Mr. William Robertson
in&nbsp;1862&nbsp;married Martha Mary, second daughter of the late
Mr. J. R. Murphy, of Melbourne. Mr. Robertson's eldest son, William
St. Leger, was educated at Oxford, and during his stay there had
the same pleasant experience as his father of being one of the
winning crew in the annual boat race against Cambridge. He
afterwards settled at Broome, W.A., as resident partner with the
Messrs. Streeter, of London, in the pearl fishing industry and in
squatting pursuits in the Kimberley district. Mr. Robertson died at
Colac on June 24th, 1892. [This biography appeared in the

Vice-President of the Irish Local Government Board; and his younger
brother, Sir William Cleaver Francis
Robinson (<i>q.v.</i>), is Governor of Western Australia. He
was born in 1824. and educated at Sandhurst Military College. After
serving in the 87th Royal Irish Fusiliers, he retired from the army
in 1846, and was employed during the Irish famine under the
Commissioners of Public Works and the Poor Law Board; being
appointed Chief Commissioner to inquire into the fairs and markets
of Ireland in 1852. He became President of Montserrat in 1854,
Lieut.Governor of St. Christopher in the same year (holding also
the dormant commission of Governor-in-Chief of the Leeward
Islands), and Governor of Hong Kong in 1859, in which year he was
knighted. Sir Hercules was a member of the Commission appointed in
1863 to enquire into the financial condition of the Straits
Settlements, was Governor of Ceylon from 1865 to 1871, and of New
South Wales from June 1872 to March 1879. During his term of office
in New South Wales he made several suggestive speeches, especially
one on the question of Intercolonial Federation, which has since
ripened so remarkably. His patronage of the turf and his
participation in the sport as an owner of racehorses also added
greatly to his personal popularity. Immediately on the expiry of
his term of office in New South Wales he was transferred to New
Zealand, where he administered the government until August 1880,
when he was appointed Governor of the Cane of Good Hope and Her
Majesty's High Commissioner for South Africa. Sir Hercules, who was
created K.C.M.G. in 1869 and G.C.M.G. in 1875, in recognition of
his services in negotiating the cession to the British Crown in
1874 of the islands of Fiji, of which he was acting Governor until
the arrival of Sir Arthur Gordon, was sent on a special
mission to Mauritius in 1886, and as the result of his inquiries
suspended the Governor, Sir John Pope Hennessy, who was, however,
subsequently reinstated. Sir Hercules, who was appointed to the
Privy Council in 1882, resigned his official connection with South
Africa in 1889, and has since resided in England. He married, in
1846, Hon. Nea Arthur Ada Rose d'Amour, fifth daughter of the 9th
Viscount Valentia, whose elder sister Ada subsequently married his

was marked with great success. Sir Henry Loch having returned and
departed for the Cape, Sir William administered the Government from
Nov. 16th to 28th, pending the arrival of the Earl of
Hopetoun, who had been appointed to succeed Sir H. Loch. Sir
William subsequently proceeded to England, having been in the
meantime nominated for the third time to the governorship of
Western Australia, it being the desire of Her Majesty's Government
to avail themselves of his administrative experience and previous
knowledge of the colony to preside over the inauguration of
responsible government in the last of the Crown colonies of the
Australian group. Sir William rendered valuable assistance whilst
in London both to the Colonial Office and to the Western Australian
delegation in facilitating the passage of the Constitution Bill,
through the Imperial Parliament. After having been received by the
Queen at Balmoral, Sir William Robinson left for Perth in Sept
1890. He married April 7th, 1862, Olivia Edith Deane, fourth
daughter of the Right Rev. Dr. Thomas Townshend, Bishop of Meath,
and was created C.M.G. in 1873, K.C.M.G. in 1877, and G.C.M.G. on
May 24th, 1887. Sir William was very cordially received on his
return to Western Australia, and carried out all the formalities in
connection with the inauguration of responsible government with
entire success . It may be mentioned that so satisfied were all
parties in Victoria with Sir William Robinson's brief
administration of the affairs of that colony that the head of the
Government and the leader of the Opposition were about to send a
joint request to the Colonial Office that Sir William might be
appointed to permanently succeed Sir Henry Loon as Governor, when
news came that Lord Hopetoun had been appointed. Sir William
Robinson is a musician of considerable eminence, and has composed a
number of popular songs, amongst which the best known
are&mdash;"Remember me so more," "I love thee so," "Imperfectus,"
"Severed," "Thou art my soul," etc. Towards the end of 1891 Sir
William Robinson went to England on leave and was offered the post
of Agent-General of Western Australia. This, however, he declined,
and returned to the colony as Governor, leaving England in May
1892.</p>

Phillip King in his expedition to survey the north and north-west
coasts of the continent of Australia in 1818, and was a member of
King's fourth expedition in 1821. He was one of the founders of
Western Australia, going out as surveyor with Governor Stirling on
the <i>Parmelia</i>, and landing on Garden Island with the
pioneer party on June 1st, 1829. He took part in nearly every
exploring expedition sent forth in that colony. He started from
York in Sept. 1848 with a party of six persons, eleven horses, and
provisions for four months. In Oct. they reached the Pallinup,
the last water crossed by Eyre, and steering north-east, crossed
several good streams. Then succeeded dense scrubs, dry
watercourses, and salt lakes till they reached the Bremer range. No
better view could be obtained from the Fitzgerald Peaks at a
thousand feet above the level of the plains. A retreat to the south
towards Mount Ridley showed no better country. Four days and three
nights they were without water, and the flashes of the Aurora
Australia added to the horrors of the scene. Still struggling to
attain the Russell mountains, cutting their way with axes through
thickets fifteen feet high, they at length reached the range in
lat. 38° 27', and found further progress impossible. The party
returned by Esperance Bay. On the Phillips river they found
extensive coal deposits, and on Feb. 2nd returned to Perth, after
an exploration of eighteen hundred miles. Roe is styled by
Australian writers the "father of modern explorers." Mrs. Roe, who
accompanied her husband to Western Australia in 1829, died on July
22nd, 1870. Captain Roe, who was Surveyor-General of Western
Australia for forty-two years, died at Perth, in that colony, on

as special commissioner of the London <i>Daily
Telegraph</i> in the conduct of an inquiry into the condition
of the Scotch agricultural labourers, and had considerable
experience as a special correspondent in various parts of Europe.
He acted in this capacity for the
Edinburgh <i>Scotsman</i> during the Turco-Russian war,
and was for some time on the staff of General Skobeleff. He was
several times wounded, being present at Plevna, the capture of the
Gravitza redoubt, and most of the memorable scenes of that bloody
and hotly contested war. Subsequently be returned to Edinburgh
University for three years, and studied for the Bar with
distinguished success. In 1879 he went as special commissioner to
the East, to inquire into the condition of the Christian population
in Roumelia, Macedonia, Albania and Armenia, and his report formed
a subject of debate in both Houses of Parliament. On the advice of
Sir Thomas McIlwraith, in 1884 he went to Queensland and was
admitted to the local Bar in December of that year. Mr. Rose was
one of the commissioners appointed to inquire into the Polynesian
labour traffic in 1885, and formed an opinion decidedly adverse to
this method of supplying labour to the Queensland sugar plantations
as the system was then conducted. At the beginning of 1888 he
became editor-in-chief of the <i>Courier</i>, which position
he occupied until 1891, when he left for England. Amongst other

California, and in 1877 to New Zealand, where he engaged in mining
pursuits, which he has ever since followed. He married, at Thames,
N.Z., Rebecca, daughter of William Huntley, a settler of fifty
years in that colony. In Feb. 1889 he was appointed by the
Government of South Australia, Inspector of Mines, Warden of
Goldfields, and Inspector under the Mining on Private Property Act
of 1888. In the following year he was sent to London as Executive
Commissioner for South Australia at the International Exhibition of
Mining and Metallurgy, held at the Crystal Palace in 1890, in which
year he resigned his official employment under the Government of
South Australia, and accepted the management of the Aclare Silver

Australia, was the son of John Pemberton Ross, a West Indian
planter, by his marriage with a daughter of Dr. Alexander Anderson.
In 1858 Mr. Ross was appointed acting Colonial Secretary of the
Gold Coast, but retired in August 1859, after displaying great
bravery and discretion in dealing with the disaffected tribes. When
at Cape Coast Castle he initiated negotiations which led to the
ultimate acquisition by England of the Dutch settlements on the
Gold Coast. On his return home Mr. Ross was appointed to the
commissariat control of districts A and B, but in 1860 was ordered
to China and served at Tientsin with the expeditionary force under
General Sir Hope Grant. He was then military accountant in China,
stationed at Hong Kong until 1862, when he was appointed head of
the Commissariat Department in South Australia, and subsequently
provincial aide-de-camp and private secretary to Sir D. Daly,
the then Governor. Mr. Ross served in the Maori war of 1864-5, and
received the New Zealand medal. At the close of the war he returned
to Australia, and in 1869, on promotion, to England. He visited
India at the request of Sir James Fergusson, then Governor of
South Australia, with a view to inducing the Government to start a
central remount station at Port Darwin, so as to secure a steady
supply of Australian horses for army purposes. Though this mission
was in the end resultless, Mr. Ross was officially thanked by the
Governor-General for the information afforded. In a letter to
the <i>Times</i> written about this time Mr. Ross
advocated the then novel idea that the Port Darwin line of cable
communication between England and Australia should be constructed
without subsidies on a business basis, as was ultimately done. In
Dec. 1869 Mr. Ross was ordered to Ireland to take charge of the
flying columns then being organised at Limerick, Tipperary, etc.,
to operate against the Fenians. In May 1870 he was stationed at
Manchester on duty in the Control Department, but in the following
year finally left the Government service and settled in South
Australia. Here he was elected to the Legislative Assembly for
Wallaroo in 1875, and for Gumeracha later on. On the death of
Mr. Dutton in 1877, he was offered the post of
Agent-General for the colony in London, but declined it, and
Sir Arthur Blyth was appointed. He was Treasurer in
the Colton Government from June 1876 to Oct. 1877, and in
Jan. 1881 he was elected Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in
succession to the late Sir G. S. Kingston. He was three times
successively re-elected, and filled the chair of the house till his

Rounsevell, inherited a large fortune; and he has since been
engaged in pastoral and commercial pursuits. He was elected member
for the Burra in 1875, which district he represented continuously
till the general election in 1890, when he sought the suffrages of
the electors of Port Adelaide, and was returned at the head of the
poll. In Dec. 1881 he was elected mayor of Glenelg. When
Mr. G. S. Fowler resigned his position in Parliament
through ill-health, Mr. Rounsevell received the portfolio of
Treasurer in the Morgan Ministry on May 10th, 1881; but he only
filled the office for a few weeks in consequence of the resignation
of the Government on June 24th following. When the Hon. J. Colton
formed his last Ministry in June 1884, Mr. Rounsevell was his
Treasurer, and he retained that office until the downfall of the
administration in June 1885. He was one of the two candidates for
the Speakership at the opening of the Parliament elected in 1890,
and received the support of the Cockburn Ministry; but he
retired when it was found that there was a majority in favour of
the Hon. Jenkin Coles. Mr. Rounsevell became Commissioner of

Clarence rivers in New South Wales in August 1829. He also
displayed very keen interest in turf matters, for which his name
became a household word, importing the thoroughbred horse

performers. He was elected a member of the Parramatta Jockey Club
in Sept. 1829, just before his departure for England, where he was

meteorological observations throughout the colony, and in 1874
organised four parties to observe the transit of Venus, the results
being utilised by the Astronomer Royal in the determination of the

administrations&mdash;in the former for only three months&mdash;he held the
portfolio of Defence Minister, a position at that time involving
grave responsibility. The Whitaker-Fox Ministry, it is well known,
resigned in 1864, owing mainly to a difference of opinion with the

conduct of the Waikato war and the management of native affairs
generally. On his resignation Mr. Russell retired from
Parliamentary life. He took a leading part in the formation of the

<p><a name="A1199a" id="A1199a"></a><b>Ryan, Charles Snodgrass</b>,
M.B., C.M., was born on Sept. 20th, 1853, in Melbourne, Vict., and
educated at the Church of England Grammar School, and subsequently
at the Melbourne University, as a student of medicine; afterwards
he proceeded to Edinburgh, where he graduated in medicine and
surgery, and took the degrees of M.B. and C.M. He then travelled on
the Continent and studied medicine in France, Austria, and Italy.
In Sept. 1876 he entered the Turkish service, and was forthwith
sent to Nisch, where he was placed in charge of a large hospital
during the Servian war. He was afterwards sent to the Orchanie
Balkans in charge of 3000 Turkish soldiers, and from there was
ordered to march to Widdin, although still suffering from a severe
attack of dysentery. He reached that place in ten days, having
nearly died from exhaustion on the road. Whilst in Widdin he was
present during nine bombardments. From Widdin he proceeded with
Osman Pacha to Plevna, which he gained after marching for three
successive days and nights, and was present at the first battle of
that memorable conflict, being the only doctor on the field. He was
in the Turkish ranks at the great action of July 31st. On Sept. 8th
his horse was shot under him, and his attendant killed by his side,
whilst riding into one of the Turkish redoubts, which was about to
be attacked by Skobeleff. At the battle of Gravitza he entered one
of the redoubts captured by the Turks from the Russians, and on the
Turks, in their turn, being expelled from this redoubt, Dr. Ryan
was the last to leave it, which he did leading his horse, on which
he had placed two Turkish soldiers whose legs were broken. In this
plight he returned to Plevna, a distance of six miles, for the
first two miles of which he was exposed to a very heavy fire. He
next accompanied the expedition to Loftcha. On Oct. 18th he left
Plevna for Constantinople, and was sent to Erzeroum as head of an
ambulance. Here he remained four months in charge of a hospital.
During this period the city was besieged by the Russians for six
weeks, and for four weeks Dr. Ryan was suffering from a severe
attack of typhus, which disease carried off twenty-two out of
thirty-six surgeons in Erzeroum, more than sixteen thousand Turkish
soldiers dying from it and from dysentery. For his services during
the war he received the order of the Medjidie of the fourth class,
the order of the Osmanieh of the third class, and the war medal.
Dr. Ryan married on July 5th, 1883, Alice Elfrida, daughter of the
Hon.&nbsp;Theophilus&nbsp;J. Sumner, M.L.C., of Stony Park,
Brunswick, Vict. [This biography appeared in the <b>Supplement</b>

<p><a name="A1205" id="A1205"></a><b>Samuel, Hon. Sir Saul</b>,
K.C.M.G., C.B., Agent-General for New South Wales, is the son of
the late Sampson Samuel of London, and was born on Nov. 2nd, 1820.
When twelve years old he was taken to Sydney, N.S.W., and educated
at Sydney College under Mr. Cape. On leaving school he entered the
office of his uncles, who were merchants in England and Sydney. In
1841 Sir Saul Samuel embarked in squatting, and he and his brother
became joint owners of large stations in the western districts of
New South Wales. In 1851, shortly after the gold discovery, Sir
Saul Samuel relinquished pastoral pursuits and embarked extensively
in the mining and manufacturing interests of the country. He may be
said to have been the pioneer of several important industries which
have since been largely developed in the colony. In 1854 Sir Saul
was elected a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales,
which consisted of members partly nominated by the Crown and partly
elected, for the constituency of Roxburgh and Wellington. In 1856
responsible government was inaugurated, and Sir Saul was returned
to the Assembly soon after the new Constitution came into existence
for the Orange district. From Oct. 1859 to March 1860 he was
Colonial Treasurer in the administration of the late
Mr. William Forster. It was during his period of office that
Queensland was separated from New South Wales, and it was Sir
Saul's duty to effect the financial separation of the two colonies.
Sir Saul was also Treasurer in the late Sir Charles Cowper's
Government from Oct. 1865 to Jan. 1866; when he resigned, owing to
the rejection of a portion of his financial proposals. He was again
Treasurer from Oct. 1868 to Dec. 1870 in the Robertson and Cowper
Administrations. In 1868 Sir Saul Samuel was present at Clontarf,
when the Duke of Edinburgh was shot at and seriously wounded by
O'Farrell, and was the first to announce the occurrence of the
outrage to the Legislative Assembly, amidst a scene of much
excitement. On the following day, as a leading member of the
Opposition, he seconded the address which was proposed by the
Premier, Sir Jas. Martin, expressive of horror of the crime and
sympathy with its intended victim. In 1870, whilst in office under
Sir Chas. Cowper, Sir Saul was one of the delegates of New South
Wales to the Intercolonial Conference held in Melbourne, on which
occasion he moved a resolution in favour of Intercolonial Free
Trade, and of a uniform Australian tariff, based upon the
principles of free trade so far as fiscal requirements would
permit. In 1872 Sir Saul was elected to the Assembly for East
Sydney; but in the same year was nominated to the Upper House
in order to represent the Parkes Government in that
Chamber, with the office of Vice-President of the Executive
Council. This position he held from May to Dec., when he took the
additional office of Postmaster-General, the new Sydney post office
being opened during the time he held office, which lasted till Feb.
1875, when the Government resigned. In 1873, when
Postmaster-General, he was a member of another Conference of
Representatives of all the Colonies, which was held in Sydney, to
endeavour to come to some agreement with reference to several
important questions of common interest to the Australian colonies,
among them the mail service between the mother country and the
colonies. In consequence of the action of Victoria in entering into
a contract with the Peninsular and Oriental Company, which made
Melbourne the terminus for that mail service instead of Sydney, as
had previously been the case, Sir Saul Samuel was delegated to
proceed to New Zealand, England and the United States to establish
a postal service between England, New South Wales and New
Zealand, viâ San Francisco, which he succeeded in doing
in conjunction with Mr. Thomas Russell, C.M.G., who was appointed
to act for the New Zealand Government. Having contracted in England
for the performance of this service, Sir Saul Samuel returned to
Sydney by way of the United States, and at New York was entertained
at a public dinner, at which Mr. Arthur, then Collector of Customs
and afterwards President of the United States, was one of the
guests. At Washington Sir Saul succeeded in making a Postal
Convention with the United States Government, which was personally
ratified by President Grant, and afterwards by Her Majesty's
Government. On Sir Saul Samuel's arrival in Sydney, in Feb. 1874,
he was entertained at a public banquet in recognition of the
successful manner in which he had carried out the establishment of
what is known as the "San Francisco Mail Service." In the same year
Sir Saul was created C.M.G. He twice subsequently acted as
Postmaster-General under Sir Henry Parkes&mdash;viz., from March to
August 1877, and from Dec. 1878 to August 1880&mdash;when he accepted
the appointment of Agent-General for New South Wales in the United
Kingdom. In addition to the heavy financial operations which Sir
Saul, who was created K.C.M.G. in 1882, has carried through on
behalf of his Government, he has had to deal with Imperial
questions of considerable importance. In 1885 he was the medium of
intercommunication through which Mr. Dalley offered to place what
is known as the "Soudan Contingent" at the disposal of the British
Government, and through him its acceptance, due in great measure to
his energy and promptitude, was subsequently secured. In 1883 Sir
Saul acted as Executive Commissioner for New South Wales to the
Amsterdam Exhibition. In 1886 he was appointed one of the Royal
Commissioners for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, and on the
death of Sir Alexander Stuart, who acted for a short time as
Executive Commissioner for New South Wales, he performed the duties
of that post till the close of the Exhibition, when, for his
services in connection therewith, he received the Civil
Companionship of the Bath. In the next year Sir Saul was one of the
delegates of New South Wales to the Colonial Conference held in
London under the auspices of Lord Salisbury's Government. He was
also appointed a member of the Organising Committee of the Imperial
Institute, Sir Saul, who about this time was presented with the
freedom of the Skinners' Company, is a member of the Council of the
Royal Colonial Institute. In 1888 Sir Saul paid a short visit to
Sydney, where he received a very cordial reception from all
sections of the community. The next year he was entertained at a
public dinner in London on the occasion of his entering his
seventieth year. In 1891 Sir Saul represented the Governments of
New South Wales and Queensland at the Vienna Postal Convention. Sir
Saul married, first, in 1859, Henrietta Matilda, daughter of
Benjamin Goldsmid Levien, of Geelong, Vict.; and, secondly, in
1877, Sara Louise, daughter of B. Isaacs, J. P., of Auckland,

the following year he was elected a member of the Melbourne Harbour
Trust; and during a visit to England in 1880 was appointed as
special delegate to represent the colony before the Imperial
Commission for the protection of British possessions abroad. He
returned to Victoria in 1882, and in Nov. 1883 joined the
Service-Berry Government as Minister of Defence, in which capacity
he planned and carried out the reorganisation of the Defence
forces, naval and military, including the employment of Imperial
officers. He was also Minister of Water Supply until Feb. 1886,
when he retired on the Ministry being merged in that of
Mr. Gillies. He was appointed Executive Vice-President of the
Melbourne Centennial Exhibition of 1888, and became President on
the retirement of Mr. Justice Higinbotham. He was created C.M.G. in

rather than assent to the "one man one vote" principle of election.
Ultimately he withdrew his resignation on the measure being
dropped, but finally retired on the Ministry being reconstructed in
Feb. 1892, under Mr. Shiels, who announced his adhesion to the "one

Saunders, formerly connected with the Central News and now M.P. for
Walworth in the English Parliament. He was born at Lavington,
Wilts, on June 12th, 1820, and was educated at Bristol. He
emigrated to Nelson, N.Z., with the first party of settlers,
sailing by the Fifeshire in Sept. 1841. In 1855 he was
elected to the Nelson Provincial Council, and was appointed a J.P.
in 1858. In the next year, having written a letter to
the Nelson Examiner impugning the conduct of District
Judge Travers, he was indicted criminally and sentenced to six
months' imprisonment and a fine of £150, his name being struck off
the commission of the peace. He was, however, promptly released, in
compliance with a petition forwarded to the Governor by his
fellow-settlers, his popularity being evidenced by the fact that he
was re-elected to the Provincial Council whilst still incarcerated.
Subsequently he was returned to the House of Representatives, and
replaced on the commission of the peace. He, however, declined the
position of Colonial Treasurer when it was offered him by Mr. (now
Sir William) Fox. He was twice elected Superintendent of
Nelson, but resigned in 1867. It was during his term of office that
the perpetrators of a horrible series of murders, which startled
the colony, Burgess, Kelly, Levy, and Sullivan, were brought to
justice. On his return to the colony in 1872, after a long visit to
England, Mr. Saunders resided in the Canterbury district, and was
elected M.H.R. for Cheviot in 1877, and again in 1879. In 1880 he

formerly consul at Bangkok, who was associated with Baron von
Humboldt in his scientific researches in South America. He was born
at Fribault, in Saxony, in 1811; and,having studied botany at
Berlin and in the Royal Gardens at Potsdam, accompanied his brother
on several of his expeditions&mdash;notably that to British Guiana in
1840, where the latter acted as Commissioner for delimiting its
boundaries. Returning to Germany, the subject of this notice became
involved in the political troubles of the time, and, aided by his
friends&mdash;Humboldt and Leopold von Buch&mdash;escaped punishment by a
timely flight to South Australia, whither his brother Otto
accompanied him. They bought land on the Gawler river, and engaged
in farming and viticulture, calling their new location Buchsfeldt,
in honour of the friend who had assisted them in securing their
safety. Their wines quickly achieved a reputation; but after ten
years Otto von Schomburgk died, and his brother, who had been
curator of the Gawler Museum, accepted the post of Director of the
Adelaide Botanic Gardens and Secretary to the Board of Governors.
When he went to them the Gardens were little better than a
wilderness, but under his skilful management a revolution was
quickly effected, and progress was begun towards the perfection now
attained. In 1888 Dr. Schomburgk was appointed a member of the
Central Agricultural Bureau of South Australia. He was decorated
with several foreign orders, and was a member of a number of the
leading natural history and scientific societies on the continent
of Europe and in the colonies. He died on March

<p><a name="A1214" id="A1214"></a><b>Scratchley, Major-General Sir
Peter Henry</b>, K.C.M.G., R.E., was the youngest son of the late
Dr. James Scratchley, of the Royal Artillery, by his marriage with
a daughter of Captain Roberts, Commandant of Colombo, and was born
in Paris, where his father, having left the army, was practising as
a medical man, on August 24th, 1835. Having decided to adopt a
military career, General Scratchley, when not yet fifteen, was
nominated by Lord Palmerston, who had been at Harrow with his
father, to a cadetship at the Woolwich Academy, where he formed a
friendship with General Gordon, obtaining in 1854 a commission as
second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers, and being almost
immediately ordered to the Crimea, where he performed good and
gallant service in the trenches of Sebastopol, and took part in the
final assault upon the Redan, gaining in consequence the Crimean
medal with clasp for Sebastopol and the Turkish war medal. On his
return from the Crimea in 1856 he was employed for twelve months on
engineering works at Portsmouth; and subsequently served with
distinction during the stern scenes of the Indian Mutiny. In 1860
the Government of Victoria applied to the Imperial Government for
an officer of engineers to superintend the erection of defence
works in that colony; and General Scratchley (then captain) was
selected for the post. He thus commenced a connection with the
great work of Australasian defence, which terminated only with his
life. Captain Scratchley was occupied for three years and a half in
devising a scheme of defence for Victoria, in the meantime taking a
prominent part in the local volunteer movement, acting as honorary
lieut.-colonel of the Volunteer Artillery and Engineers. Owing to a
change of Ministry his scheme was not carried out in its entirety,
and Captain Scratchley returned to England in 1863, carrying with
him the official eulogies of
Governors Barkly and Darling on his services to
the colony. Subsequently, having been promoted to brevet rank as
major, he was for twelve years chief inspector of the manufacturing
department of the War Office. In 1874 Major Scratchley became
lieut.-colonel, and in 1876 was selected by Lord Carnarvon, upon
the recommendation of the Secretary for War, to act, in conjunction
with Sir William Jervois, as adviser to the Australasian
Governments in providing for the defence of the entire group of
colonies against foreign aggression. In 1878 Sir William Jervois
became Governor of South Australia, and Colonel Scratchley was
appointed Commissioner of Defences for the Colonies of New South
Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania,
remaining in Australia in that capacity until 1883. In 1879 Colonel
Scratchley, as he had now become, was created C.M.G.; and, despite
the obstacles raised by the ever-shifting policy of the constantly
changing colonial governments, did much good work in connection
with the conjoint defences; In Oct. 1882 he retired from the army
with the honorary rank of major-general; and on his return to
England in the early part of 1883 was appointed Adviser on Defences
to the colonies which he had previously served as Commissioner. He
did not, however, hold this appointment long, being despatched from
England, in Nov. 1884, as Special Commissioner to assume
jurisdiction over the southern shore of New Guinea and the country
adjacent thereto from the 141st meridian of east longitude eastward
as far as East Cape, and as Deputy-Commissioner to the portions of
New Guinea outside the protectorate, the intention of Germany to
annex the northern portion being then somewhat in embryo, at least
as far as the Australian colonies were aware. On his arrival at
Albany General Scratchley first heard of the German annexation, and
thus had to make his financial arrangements with the various
Australian colonies for the future administration of the British
protectorate under circumstances of great difficulty, as the latter
were naturally indignant that Germany should have been allowed to
filch away any portion of what they regarded as the natural
heritage of the Australasian people. Ultimately all difficulties
were smoothed over&mdash;at least temporarily&mdash;and General Scratchley
arrived at Port Moresby to assume the control of
the protectorate on August 28th, 1885. In November, whilst
proceeding in the steamer Governor Blackall to inspect
the boundary of the British territory at Mitre Rock, General
Scratchley was taken ill with what proved to be New Guinea fever.
As the attack seemed to be mild, he insisted on continuing his
voyage to Mitre Rock, which was reached on Nov. 25th; but after
remaining there for a short time he became so much worse that it
was determined to return direct to Cooktown, where
the Governor Blackall arrived on Dec. 1st. Early that
morning he seemed better, but towards noon he became completely
prostrated by the intense heat, and for some hours was scarcely
conscious. All speed was therefore made to reach
Townsville, en route for Sydney and cooler latitudes; but
Sir Peter Scratchley gradually sank, and died at sea on the morning
of Dec. 2nd, 1885. Sir Peter Scratchley (who was created K.C.M.G.
in 1885) married, in 1862, Laura Lilias, daughter of Sylvester J.
Browne, of co. Sligo. In 1887 a volume on "Australian Defences and
New Guinea," compiled from Sir Peter Scratchley's papers, was
published under the editorship of Mr. C. Kinloch Cooke, with a
prefatory memoir.</p>

<p><a name="A1222" id="A1222"></a><b>Selwyn, Right Rev. George
Augustus</b>, D.D., first and last Anglican bishop of New Zealand,
was the son of William Selwyn, Q.C., the eminent jurist, who was
selected to instruct Prince Albert "in the constitution and laws of
his adopted country." The Bishop's mother was Letitia Frances,
daughter of Roger Kynaston, of Witham, Essex, and he was born at
Church Row, Hampstead, Middlesex, on April 5th, 1809. His elder
brother, the Rev. William Selwyn, was, it may be here mentioned, an
eminent divine, who was offered the bishopric of New Zealand prior
to its being proposed to himself. Another brother, the late Lord
Justice Sir Charles Jasper Selwyn, was an eminent lawyer and judge.
Bishop Selwyn was primarily educated at a large private school at
Ealing, where the two Newmans, cardinal and theist, received their
early training. Later on he went to Eton, where Mr. Gladstone was
one of his schoolfellows and personal friends. His future coadjutor
Bishop Abraham was also amongst his contemporaries at Eton, where
Selwyn was equally prominent as a scholar and athlete. In 1827 he
left Eton for Cambridge, where he was scholar and subsequently
Fellow of St. John's. In 1829 he rowed seventh in the Cambridge
boat in the first inter-university boat race. In 1831 he took his
degree, coming out junior optime in mathematics and second classic
of his year, and after a brief visit to the Continent settled down
at Eton as private tutor to the sons of Lord Powis, who were at the
school In 1833 Mr. Selwyn was ordained deacon, and acted as curate
to the vicar of Eton. In June 1839 he married Sarah, daughter of
Sir John Richardson, one of the judges of the Court of Common
Pleas, a step which compelled him to resign his Fellowship at St.
John's College, Cambridge. In 1841, whilst still curate of Eton, he
was offered the newly constituted bishopric of New Zealand by
Bishop Blomfield, of London. This he accepted in May of the same
year, lodging a protest, however, against the wording of the
"letters patent" appointing him to the see, in which the Queen was
referred to as giving him "power to ordain." On Oct. 17th, 1841,
the Bishop was consecrated at Lambeth, and on Dec. 26th he set sail
from Plymouth in the Tomatin, acquiring the Maori language on
the voyage out from a young New Zealander named Rupai, who had been
educated in England, and was returning to his native country. On
April 14th, 1842, the Tomatin cast anchor in the harbour
of Sydney, N.S.W., where Bishop Selwyn spent some weeks with the
Bishop of Australia, Dr. Broughton. Ultimately he left for New
Zealand in a small brigantine called the Bristolian, reaching
Auckland on May 30th, 1842. Here he was for a short time the guest
of Captain Hobson at Government House. He soon, however, took up
his permanent quarters, at the Waimate, where he remained till
1844, when he went to reside at Auckland, appointing the Rev. Henry
Williams to the charge of the locale as Archdeacon of Waimate. The
Bishop early undertook a visitation of his wild and almost
impenetrable diocese in both islands, and founded St. John's
College at Auckland for the training of Maori candidates for holy
orders. He quickly acquired a strong influence over the Maoris and
frequently offered his mediation in the various conflicts between
the two races. In 1844 Captain Fitzroy, the then Governor of
New Zealand, proposed to the Legislative Council to increase his
salary and allow him expenses, but the proposal was rejected by a
majority of two, in vindication of the principle of the equality of
the various denominations in the eye of the State. In 1844 he
convened a Church synod in New Zealand, this being the first
assembly of the kind brought together under the auspices of
Anglicanism since Convocation had been silenced in 1717. There were
present the Bishop, three archdeacons, four priests, and two
deacons, and questions of Church discipline and Church extension
were discussed. But this meeting was held to be illegal by the
British authorities. So in 1847 a second synod was held, when the
Bishop read a correspondence between the Archbishop of Canterbury
and Mr. Gladstone, then Colonial Secretary, proposing a Church
constitution in which bishops, clergy, and laity should be
represented. The six bishops of Australasia met at Sydney in 1850
and likewise recommended a constitution for the Australasian Church
in which the laity should be united with the clergy. Two years
later the laity of New Zealand, headed by the Governor, petitioned
to be allowed to take part in Church legislation. And at length in
1859 the first General Synod was held, at which five bishops and a
large number both of clergy and laity were present. The Church of
New Zealand, thanks to the labours of Bishop Selwyn and Sir William
Martin, aided not a little by Sir George Grey, was definitely
founded on personal consent, and has been the most independent of
external trammels of any of the Australasian Churches. Bishop
Selwyn was what is called a High Churchman, and at  first did
not get on well with the Nonconformist missionaries labouring in
New Zealand. Gradually, however, reciprocal feelings of respect
sprang up; and when  Bishop Selwyn left New Zealand, some
of  the warmest tributes paid to his high qualities emanated
from Nonconformist sources. Bishop Selwyn having acquired the Maori
language himself, was able consistently to render the knowledge of
the native tongue a condition precedent to ordination for his
missionary clergy. The Bishop was early brought into conflict with
the New Zealand Company, whose resort to physical force for the
acquirement of Maori lands he protested against from the first as
part of his Christian duty. The company therefore ignored him in
initiating the Otago and Canterbury settlements. He was not very
favourable in his prognostications as to the success of the latter,
and in a letter written in Dec 1848 expressed a preference for the
Hawke's Bay district, the heads of the Waipu and Waikata rivers,
the plain of the Thames, and the vicinity of the Wairoa, and
Kaipara rivers as respectively superior sites for prosperous
exploration. In 1847-8 he paid his first visit to the Polynesian
islands in H.M.S. Dido. His second visit was accomplished in
1849, in the little schooner Undine. In 1850 Bishop
Selwyn attended the first Pan-Australasian Synod at Sydney. Out of
this assemblage sprang the Australasian Board of Missions, which
found funds for a missionary vessel of a superior class, The
Border Maid, in which the Bishop, accompanied by his former college
friend and fellow-oarsman Bishop Tyrrell, of Newcastle, N.S.W.,
paid his third visit to the South Seas in 1851. On the last day of
the year 1853, Bishop Selwyn sailed from New Zealand on a visit to
England, and did not return to Auckland till July 5th, 1855. He was
very shortly involved in the Maori war troubles, and had the
mortification of seeing the major part of his native flock abjure
Christianity for the degrading Hau Hau superstition. In the
meantime he had brought back with him from England Mr. John
Coleridge Patteson to superintend the Melanesian Mission, of which
he constituted New Norfolk the future centre. In 1861 Mr. Patteson
became the first Bishop of Melanesia, and was destined to have as
his successor Bishop Selwyn's own son. By the year 1867, when Dr.
Selwyn again left New Zealand to attend the first Pan-Anglican
Synod at Lambeth, he had succeeded in his long-conceived plan of
dividing his diocese, Bishop Harper being placed in charge of the
Southern Island as Bishop of Christchurch. The two islands were
still further subdivided by the consecration of Bishops Abraham and
Williams to Wellington and Waiapu in the North, and of Bishops
Hobhouse and Jenner to Nelson and Dunedin in the South Island. Thus
seven sees took the place of the one over which he had had sole
charge. The Church, too, had got its constitution into working
order; theological training schools had been established, and a
native ministry ordained both for Maori and Melanesian service.
Whilst in England in 1867, he was offered by the then Premier, Lord
Derby, the bishopric of Lichfield, which, however, he at first
refused, on grounds thus stated by himself: "(1) Because the native
race requires all the efforts of the few friends that remain to
them; (2) because the organisation of the Church in New Zealand is
still incomplete; (3) because I have still, so far as I can judge,
health and strength for the peculiar duties which habit has made
familiar to me; (4) because my bishopric is not endowed; (5)
because I have personal friends to whom I am so deeply indebted
that I feel bound to work with them so long as I can; (6) because a
report was spread in New Zealand that I did not intend to return,
to which I answered that nothing but illness or death would prevent
me. I could work with all my heart in the Black Country if it were
not that my heart is in New Zealand and Melanesia." Ultimately,
under pressure from the Primate and from the Queen, Bishop Selwyn
recalled his refusal, and at Windsor on Dec. 1st, 1867, personally
intimated to her Majesty his acceptance of the Lichfield see, and
on Jan. 9th, 1868, was enthroned in Lichfield Cathedral. Having got
his new diocese into something like working order, he set sail on
July 2nd, 1868, to pay a farewell visit to New Zealand, accompanied
by his wife and his son John, the future Bishop of Melanesia. They
chose the Panama route, and on the steamer reaching Wellington were
transhipped into a Colonial steamer, which ran upon a rock in Cook
Straits, and slipping off, went to the bottom, after giving those
on board barely time to escape in the boats. On arrival at Auckland
Bishop Selwyn presided for the last time at the General Synod of
the Church of New Zealand on Oct. 6th. He was presented with
numerous farewell addresses from both whites and natives, and
finally sailed from Auckland on Oct. 20th, 1868, arriving in
England on the last day of the year. The Bishop strongly opposed
the disestablishment of the Irish Church in 1869, and was one of
the bishops who protested against the consecration of Dr. Temple to
the see of Exeter in the same year. Bishop Selwyn died at Lichfield
on April 11th, 1878, and was buried in the cathedral. Almost his
last intelligible words&mdash;"It is light"&mdash;were spoken to
Sir William Martin in Maori. Amongst the pall-bearers at
his funeral were Mr. Gladstone and Sir William Martin; his
coadjutors in England and New Zealand, Bishops Abraham and
Hobhouse, being also present.</p>

successfully established, he returned to England, after five years'

staff of the Daily News.</p>

<p><a name="A1225" id="A1225"></a><b>Service, Hon. James</b>,
M.L.C., is the son of the late Robert Service, and was born at
Kilwinning, in Ayrshire, in Nov. 1823. Having formed relations with
the eminent Glasgow firm of Thomas Corbett &amp; Co., Mr. Service
emigrated to Australia when just thirty years old, and settling in
Melbourne, ultimately started the well-known commercial house with
which his name has ever since been allied. Mr. Service was first
brought into prominence through his connection with the agitation
for erecting Emerald Hill into a separate municipality, of which
when formed he was elected the first chairman. In 1857 he was
returned to the Assembly for Melbourne, as an opponent of the
O'Shanassy Government, but was unsuccessful at the general election
two years later, when he stood for Emerald Hill. He was, however,
promptly returned for the country constituency of Ripon and
Hampden, and retained the seat till 1862, when he resigned,
preparatory to paying a visit to England. In the meantime he had
been in office for a brief interval (Oct. 1859 to Sept. 1860) as
Minister of Lands in the Nicholson Government, and in this capacity
introduced the first Land Bill, involving the important principle
of selection before survey. It was not, however, passed, owing to
the strenuous opposition of the Upper House squatters. In
connection with the contest with the Council over this bill,
circumstances arose within the Cabinet which convinced Mr. Service
that his personal position would be stultified were he to continue
a member of the Ministry, and, to the great regret of his
colleagues, he therefore resigned; Mr. Francis, with characteristic
chivalrous impetuosity, electing to go out with him. Both gentlemen
subsequently declined to join the Heales Ministry. As a private
member Mr. Service conferred an enormous boon on the colony by
carrying through the Victorian Parliament what is popularly known
as the Torrens Act, for facilitating the transfer of real property.
He returned from England to find the colony plunged in the throes
of the conflict brought about by the protectionist tendencies of
the M?Culloch tariff. Being a staunch free-trader, Mr.
Service took the unpopular side; and though he contested several
seats in the interim, was kept out of Parliament till 1874, when he
was returned for Maiden, for which constituency he sat till 1881,
when he resigned prior to paying a second visit to England. Mr.
Service was thus absent from the Assembly throughout the embittered
conflict with the Upper Chamber over the tariff and Darling grant
tacks. Though an unswerving free-trader, advocating his views on
every hustings at which he appeared, Mr, Service did
not believe in the utility of constantly tilting in Parliament
against a policy which the country had unmistakably approved by an
overwhelming majority; and he therefore tendered his support to the
administration of his old friend Mr. Francis, with whose general
principles he agreed. In July 1874 Mr. Francis retired; and his
Ministry was reconstructed under Mr. Kerferd, who succeeded in
inducing Mr. Service to become Treasurer in the new combination.
During his brief tenure of office Mr. Service slightly revised the
tariff, but the next year, when he boldly proposed to reduce
the ad valorem duties from 20 to 15 per cent., he was
less fortunate. It is usual to consider the acceptance of the first
item by a fair majority as tantamount to the acceptance of the
entire budget, and this was obtained; but subsequently, there being
only a majority of two in favour of adding two shillings to the
spirit duty, the Ministry decided to appeal to the country, and
being refused a dissolution, resigned office, making way for the
first cabinet of Mr. (now Sir Graham) Berry. Mr. Service sat in
opposition to this Government, and to that of Sir James M?Culloch,
which replaced it, and during the session of 1876 delivered a
scathing indictment of the latter's financial policy. The effect on
the House and the country was enormous, and the blow was repeated
with, if possible, added momentum, in a speech made at Maldon
during the famous electoral contest of 1877. The forces of Sir
James M?Culloch were annihilated, and the Stonewall party came back
from the polls with an overwhelming majority. Mr. Berry, their
victorious chief, recognising the potential assistance afforded him
by Mr. Service, offered him any post outside the premiership,
provided he would aid the new Ministry with the weight of his great
financial authority. And though Mr. Service felt obliged to decline
the offer, he gave the Berry Cabinet an independent support until
the Black Wednesday dismissals occasioned its withdrawal. In 1880
Mr. Service formed his first Ministry; but not succeeding in
obtaining a sufficient majority to carry his Reform Bill, which,
whilst popularising the franchise of the Upper House, increased its
financial powers, through the Lower Chamber, he appealed to the
country, and, being placed in a minority, made way for Mr. Berry's
return to power. Mr. Service now revisited England, coming back to
the colony just in time to take part in the general election of
1883, when he was returned to Parliament for Castlemaine as the
recognised leader of the Constitutional party&mdash;as the Conservatives
had been rechristened. Coalescing with Mr. Berry, who, as leader of
the Liberals, had a nearly equal following, Mr. Service became
Premier and Chief Secretary of the colony. Amongst the principal
achievements of the new Ministry were the measures by which
appointments to the Civil Service and the control of the State
railways were transferred from political hands into those of
permanent Commissions. The general policy of the Government,
especially in regard to Western Pacific affairs, tended strongly,
also, to the development of a more decidedly Australian sentiment;
whilst, in regard to the question of federation, Mr. Service "took
up the mantle" of Sir Thomas McIlwraith, the well-known
Queensland statesman, who had temporarily retired from public life;
the result being the holding of the Sydney Convention and the
formation of the Federal Council of Australasia. Mr. Service
resigned at the end of 1885, and shortly afterwards left on a third
visit to England, being subsequently appointed one of the four
representatives of Victoria at the Colonial Conference of 1887. Mr.
Service believes, with Sir S. Griffith, that this Conference
should be the precursor of other similar conclaves, and is strongly
of opinion that if the Empire is to be saved from the provincialism
both of the Colonial and the English legislatures, the nebulous
feeling in favour of Imperial federation must shortly take concrete
form in a superior council, in which the entire Empire will be
represented, and which will have the supreme control of all purely
Imperial affairs. On his return to the colony Mr. Service, who
generally approved the policy of the late Gillies-Deakin
Government, evinced a strong disinclination to renew his
participation in active politics. He however accepted a seat in the
Upper House for the Melbourne province, and occasionally interposes
when questions of colonial or Imperial importance, with which
he has been identified in the past, are brought on the tapis.
It was a matter of general regret that Mr. Service should have been
absent from the Melbourne Federation Conference of 1890, and still
more that he should have felt bound to disregard the unanimous wish
of the Legislative Council that he should attend as one of their
representatives at the Sydney Convention in 1891. It is understood
that Mr. Service has on two occasions refused the honour of
knighthood.</p>

Isle of Wight, where he was born. He adopted his father's
profession, and after practising for some years in England, settled
in Canterbury, N.Z., in Feb. 1853. He was one of the leading
members of the Canterbury Association, being deputy-chairman of the
committee of management before leaving London. Mr. Sewell practised
as a solicitor in New Zealand, and sat in the first House of
Representatives as member for Christchurch in 1854. He held office
in the first inchoate Ministry formed under Mr. Fitzgerald from
June to August 1854, and himself became Premier in May 1856,
resigning in the same month owing to the refusal of the acting
Governor to concede full responsible functions to the
administration. Mr. Sewell was a member of the first Stafford
Ministry from June 1856 to April 1859, when he resigned, after
holding the portfolios of Colonial Treasurer and Commissioner of
Customs for varying periods. In the Fox Ministry which
succeeded, he was Attorney-General from August 1861 to August 1862,
and held the same post as a member of the Legislative Council in
the Domett Government from August 1862 to Jan. 1863. In

well-known operatic singer, was born in Tasmania. She had but
limited means to advance her musical education in her early days,
her only teacher being her mother. There chanced, however, to come
to Tasmania a troupe of Italian artistes, and Miss Sherwin joined
them. Her début was made in Melbourne, Vict.,
in Lucia. In 1879 she went to America, and was engaged to sing
in Berlioz's Faust at its initial performance. She took
part in the Cincinnati Festival under Theodore Thomas in 1880-1.
Then, having studied with Dr. Damrosch, Errani, and Madame
Keppiani, Miss Sherwin came to Europe and placed herself under
Stockhausen, Hustache, Vannuccini, and Ronconi, and made her
appearance in London in 1883, winning her first success at the
Promenade Concerts. Next, she connected herself with the Carl Rosa
Opera Company, and sang at the Richter and Crystal Palace Concerts.
In 1887 she visited Australia, and was received with great
enthusiasm. She appeared in both concert and opera, and alter a
year of prosperous achievement went to India, China, and Japan on a
concert tour in 1888, reaching Europe in 1889; here she sang in the
principal towns of Germany and Austria, and settled again in London

<p><a name="A1238" id="A1238"></a><b>Shiels, Hon. William</b>,
M.L.A., LL.B., Premier of Victoria, is a native of Ireland, and
came to Victoria with his parents when a child. He was educated at
the Scotch College, Melbourne, and at the Melbourne University,
where he took the degrees of LL.B. and Master of Laws, He was
admitted to the Victorian Bar in 1873, and practised his profession
in Melbourne. At the general election of 1877 he was returned for
Normanby in the Conservative and free trade interest, and has
represented the constituency uninterruptedly ever since. It is in
connection with the measure for extending the rights of women in
the matter of divorce that Mr. Shiels has won his principal repute.
Not only did he secure the passage of the measure through the
Victorian Parliament, but by his tactful conduct during his mission
to London in the early part of 1890, he, in the face of much
prejudiced opposition, induced the Salisbury Government to advise
Her Majesty to assent to the measure, which had been reserved for
the Queen's assent. In Nov. 1890, on the formation of the Munro
Ministry, Mr. Shiels was appointed Attorney-General and Minister of
Railways, and sat, pending the arrival of Mr. (now Sir Henry John)
Wrixon, as one of the delegates at the Federal Convention of 1891.
In Feb. 1892 Mr. Munro resigned the Premiership, when the Ministry
was reconstructed under Mr. Shiels, who took the post of Treasurer
along with the Premiership. In April of that year Sir Graham
Berry, who had been pressed to join the Ministry previously, agreed
to take the post of Treasurer; and it was then relinquished by Mr.
Shiels, who now acts as Premier and Attorney-General. Mr. Shiels
has made reform of the railway system of the colony his speciality,
and in 1891 passed the amending Railway Management Bill, which
reduced the powers of the permanently appointed Railway
Commissioners, who in the next year were suspended by his Ministry,
and finally relinquished office a few months later.</p>

to administer certain of the Imperial laws relating to seamen, then
just adopted in Victoria, and in this position he remained until,
on a general reduction in the departments in 1869, he retired from
the Civil Service with compensation. He was reappointed to the
Civil Service in 1875, and successively held the appointments of
Secretary to the Police Superannuation and Police Medical Boards,

<p><a name="A1242" id="A1242"></a><b>Short, Right Rev.
Augustus</b>, D.D., first Church of England Bishop of Adelaide,
belonged to the family of the Shorts of Bickham, in Devonshire. His
father, Charles Short, who practised as a barrister in London,
resided at Woodlands, Wartlington, Hants. He was born on June 11th,
1802, and educated at Westminster School and at Christ Church,
Oxford, where his cousin, Thomas Vowler Short, afterwards Bishop of
Sodor and Man and of St. Asaph, was tutor. He graduated B.A. in
1823 as first class in classics, M.A. in 1826, and remained at
Oxford in the capacity of a private tutor, being ordained deacon in
1826 and priest the next year, when he undertook duty as curate of
Culham, near Abingdon. Two years later he resigned the curacy, on
being appointed tutor and lecturer of his college,
Mr. Gladstone being amongst his pupils. In 1833 he was
appointed public examiner in the Classical Schools, and in the next
year Sub-censor of Christ Church. In June 1835 he was presented by
his college to the vicarage of Ravensthorpe, Northamptonshire, and
on Dec. 10th he married Miss Millicent Phillips, of Hints Hall,
Staffordshire. In 1845 Mr. Short was appointed Bampton Lecturer at
his old university; and in 1847, when the sees of Melbourne,
Adelaide and Newcastle (N.S.W.) were established and endowed
through the liberality of Lady Burdett-Coutts, he was offered by
the Archbishop of Canterbury the choice of the two latter
bishoprics, and after due consideration selected Adelaide, being
consecrated in Westminster Abbey along with
Bishops Perry (Melbourne) and Tyrrell (Newcastle). The
Bishop reached Port Adelaide on Dec. 28th, 1847, this being the
eleventh anniversary of the founding of the colony of South
Australia. Dr. Hall, first Archdeacon of Adelaide, and afterwards
Bishop of Brisbane, and the Rev. J. P. Wilson, afterwards first
head master of St. Peter's Collegiate School, Adelaide, accompanied
him. Bishop Short was warmly welcomed by Governor Robe, but
soon found himself face to face with the difficulties of an
organisation more completely voluntary than he had been led to
anticipate. The modified State aid hitherto accorded to all
the denominations was abolished in 1851. Governor Gawler's
apportionment, and Governor Robe's subsequent grant, of a site for
an Anglican cathedral in the Victoria Square reserve of Adelaide,
was disputed by the local authorities, and declared by the local
courts to be invalid, on the ground that, though a governor could
legally make grants of waste lands, he could not alienate public
reserves. On appeal this judgment was affirmed by the Privy
Council, and at a later date the last vestige of Anglican
precedency was swept away by another decision of the appellate
tribunal, declaring the letters patent granted by the Crown to the
early colonial bishops, including the Bishop of Adelaide, to
be ultra vires, and invalid in all cases where issued
subsequent to the passing of the Act of 1842, which gave a
representative legislature to New South Wales. The territorial and
ecclesiastical jurisdiction conferred on him under the royal
letters patent of June 1847 having thus vanished into thin air,
Bishop Short set himself to work to create a voluntary organisation
which should replace the edifice of privilege which had thus been
cut away from beneath his feet. In this he was completely
successful, and as his sturdy and straightforward character became
understood, he gradually obtained a strong hold on the respect and
regard of the people of South Australia. His action was not always
popular, as in the case of his refusal to allow the Rev. Thomas
Binney to preach in the Church of England churches within his
diocese; whilst his co-operation with the Roman Catholics in
opposing the secular system of State education was also a rock of
offence. In other directions, where he considered no vital
principle to be involved, he disarmed hostility by timely
compromises, as in the case of the exclusive right to the
private entrée at the Governor's levees, which he had
long enjoyed. When this privilege was impugned in the Assembly,
Bishop Short proposed its extension to the heads of the other
denominations in the colony, and thus settled a matter which
Sir James Fergusson, the then Governor, was inclined to fight
out, on the ground that Bishop Short's position was differentiated
from that of the ministers of other sects by his possession of the
Queen's letters patent. When the University of Adelaide was
established, in 1872, Bishop Short was appointed the first
Vice-chancellor, and in 1876 he succeeded Sir R. D. Hanson as
Chancellor. Bishop Short attended the first General Synod of the
bishops of Australia and Tasmania, held in Sydney in 1872, and was
present at the Lambeth Conference in 1878. Having admitted the
invalidity of the letters patent issued in his own favour, Bishop
Short was strongly opposed to the action of Bishop Barker in
claiming the primacy of Australia on the strength of the letters
patent given him in 1854. At the same time he supported his
recognition as Metropolitan by the common consent of the several
Australian and Tasmanian dioceses. In the result the latter view
triumphed. Having premonitions of heart disease, Bishop Short
resigned his see in Nov. 1881, and finally left the colony in Jan.
1882. In November he assisted at the consecration of his successor.
Dr. Kennion, in Westminster Abbey, and died at Eastbourne on Oct.
5th, 1883.</p>

<p><a name="A1243" id="A1243"></a><b>Shortland, Lieutenant
Willoughby</b>, R.N., sometime acting Governor of New Zealand, came
of a Devonshire family, and entered the royal navy. In 1839 he
accompanied Captain Hobson, the first Governor of New Zealand&mdash;on
one of whose ships he had been a lieutenant&mdash;to that colony, which
had not then been annexed by England. Landing at Auckland in Jan.
1840, the British sovereignty was formally proclaimed, and
lieutenant Shortland appointed Colonial Secretary. In this capacity
he was sent in June of the same year to Port Nicholson (Wellington)
with a proclamation by the Governor dissolving the association
which the settlers had formed for their mutual protection, and
commanding them to recognise his own authority as the Queen's
representative. The Port Nicholson settlers disclaimed all notions
of disloyalty, and received Lieutenant Shortland&mdash;who does not
appear to have been formally appointed Colonial Secretary till May
1841&mdash;with an effusion which dissipated all doubts in regard to
their attitude. He acted for some months as police magistrate at
Port Nicholson. On the death of Captain Hobson in Sept. 1842;
Lieutenant Shortland assumed the reins and acted as administrator
of the government of New Zealand till the arrival of
Captain Fitzroy in Dec. 1843. This was an eventful period
in the history of the colony, the massacre at Wairan occurring
during his temporary régime. In his despatches home he
condemned the course taken in the interest of the white claimants
which led to the catastrophe, and he issued a proclamation locally
warning all claimants to lands to avoid exercising acts of
ownership until the rights in dispute had been adjudicated on.
Lieutenant Shortland was very unpopular, and a petition was sent
from Auckland in 1843 praying that he might not be appointed
Governor of New Zealand, of which there seemed some fear. On Dec.
31st, 1843, immediately after the arrival of Captain Fitzroy,
Captain Hobson's successor, Lieutenant Shortland, resigned the
Colonial Secretaryship, and was subsequently appointed Governor of
Nevis, and later on Lieutenant-Governor of Tobago, where he held
office from 1854 to 1856. Lieutenant Shortland, who married in 1842
Isabella Kate Johnston, daughter of Robert A. Fitzgerald, of
Geraldine, county Limerick, and Isabella (Johnston) his wife,
retired to live on his property at Courtlands, Kingsbridge, Devon,
where he died in 1869. His brother, Dr. Edward Shortland, who also
resided in New Zealand, was the author of "The Southern Districts
of New Zealand" (1851, Longmans); "Maori Traditions and
Superstitions" (1854, Longmans); "Maori Religion and Mythology"

Captain Fitzroy. This important office he continued to hold
until the complete introduction into the colony of responsible
government in May 1856. He had in early life served as a surgeon in
the royal navy. He is remembered as the first collector of
specimens of New Zealand natural history, botany, conchology, and
entomology. Subsequently he accompanied Dr. (afterwards Sir

sources of the rivers Rangitata and Ashburton. He attached himself
to this party, mainly with the intention of assisting in the
proposed botanical researches in the mountain ranges; and whilst so
engaged he met with his death in an attempt to wade across one of

contributed regularly to the Mining Journal, edited by George
Stevenson, at that time considered the best-conducted paper in
South Australia. When the Victorian gold fields were discovered in
1851 Mr. Sinnett left South Australia for Melbourne, and accepted

educated at Shrewsbury and at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he
graduated S.C.L. in 1837, LL.B. in 1840, and LL.D. in 1867. He
emigrated to Port Phillip in 1842, and practised as a solicitor at
Geelong till 1854. In December of that year he was acting Treasurer
during the absence of Captain Lonsdale, and held the same post as
member for Geelong under Mr. Haines, in the first
Ministry formed after the inauguration of responsible government,
from Nov. 1855 to March 1857. At the first general election for the
Assembly held under the new constitution, in 1856, he
unsuccessfully contested Geelong, and remained out of Parliament
till 1864, when he was elected to the Legislative Council for the
Western province. He became the acknowledged leader of the
Conservative Party in the Upper House during the struggle between
the M?Culloch Government, representing the majority in
the Assembly, with the Council over the backing, firstly of the
Tariff, and afterwards of the Darling grant, to the annual
Appropriation Bill. During the heat of the crisis caused by the
resignation of Sir James M?Culloch, in May 1868, he came to the aid
of the Governor, and though in a hopeless minority in the popular
House, formed a ministry, of which he was Premier and Chief
Secretary, and which, in the teeth of adverse votes in the
Assembly, held office for two months, when the crisis was
terminated by the expudiation of the grant to his wife by
ex-Governor Darling. Sir Charles did not seek re-election for
the Western province, when, in August of the same year, his seat
became vacant by effluxion of time. In 1876, however, he was again
returned by his old constituents, and took a strong Conservative
stand in defence of the privileges of the Council during the
struggle with the Berry Government and the Assembly over
payment of members, the Land Tax, and Reform of the Upper House.
Sir Charles was created K.C.M.G. in 1875. He married in 1840

educated at London University where he took a first prize in
International Law and a second prize in English Equity, and
graduated B.A. in 1840. In Nov. 1838 he entered at the Middle

for the colony of Tasmania in 1848, and Attorney-General in 1854,
only taking office on condition of being at liberty to oppose the
influx of convicts into the colony. In 1851 he was nominated to the
Legislative Council and became a member of the Executive Council in
1855. Sir Francis, who had opposed the introduction of responsible
government on the ground that the colony did not possess a leisured
class from whom suitable ministers could be drawn, and that the
system would involve constant changes of administration, was
nevertheless a member of the first House of Assembly and
Attorney-General in the first responsible ministry formed under
Colonel Champ in Nov. 1856, and which held office till Feb. 1857.
From April to May 1857 he was Attorney-General in the first Weston

M.L.A., sometime Attorney-General of Victoria, was born at
Berwick-on-Tweed in 1829. In 1855 he emigrated to Victoria and
started as a draper in Sandhurst. In 1858 he relinquished business,
and took employment in Melbourne as a reporter on
the Argus. The next year he became editor of the Leader,
the weekly journal published in connection with the
Melbourne Age; and of the latter paper was subsequently
sub-editor and, for a short time, editor. Whilst engaged as a
journalist, Mr. Smith was admitted to the Victorian Bar in Sept.
1861, and in 1865 was elected to the Legislative Assembly for South
Bourke as a Liberal and Protectionist. From July 1868 to Sept. 1869
Mr. Smith was Attorney-General in the
second M'Culloch Ministry, but at the General Election in
Jan. 1871 he did not seek re-election for South Bourke. In 1874,
however, he was again returned unopposed, and sat till 1877, when
the constituency was divided, and Mr. Smith was returned for the
Boroondara portion. He died on Dec. 9th, 1877.</p>

<p><a name="A1259" id="A1259"></a><b>Smith, James</b>, was born at
George Town, on the river Tamar, Northern Tasmania, on July 1st,
1827. For some years he followed the business of engineer and
miller with Mr. Guillan, of Launceston, but this occupation did not
suit his adventurous spirit, and on the discovery of gold in
Australia he threw up his employment, and went to the diggings. In
1853 he returned to Tasmania, and settled on the river Forth on the
north coast. Thenceforward he became an ardent searcher for
minerals, his zeal for mineralogy earning for him the sobriquet of
"Philosopher Smith," by which name he was long well known in
Northern Tasmania. In 1859 he discovered gold in the river Forth,
and silver on the beach at the Penguin in 1861. Still continuing
his search for minerals, he worked his way alone through the dense
scrub and forest to Mount Bischoff, where on Dec. 4th, 1871, he
discovered the enormous tin deposit since become so famous. He took
up two eighty-acre sections on the Mount, which are now worked by
the Mount Bischoff Tin Mining Company, having proved to be the
richest tin mine in the world. Mr. Smith's discovery was of the
greatest importance to his native colony, not only from its
intrinsic value, but also from the great impetus it gave to the
mining industry, opening the way for the great development of
mineral wealth in the west of Tasmania. In recognition of his
services, the Parliament of Tasmania in 1879 voted him a life
pension of £200 per annum. Mr. Smith was induced in 1886 to offer
himself as a candidate for the Legislative Council. He was elected
without opposition for the Mersey district, but, finding politics
uncongenial, he resigned his seat in 1888. He resides at Westwood,
Hamilton-on-Forth.</p>

<p><a name="A1260" id="A1260"></a><b>Smith, James</b>, the eminent
Victorian journalist, was born near Maidstone, in the county of
Kent, and took to literary pursuits before he was out of his teens.
He contributed occasionally to the London Punch, which brought
him into connection with Douglas Jerrold, with whom he was
associated in the Illuminated Magazine, for which he wrote
regularly. Mr. Smith was appointed at the age of twenty editor of
the Herts County Press, and afterwards took the editorship of
the Salisbury Journal, which he held from 1849 to 1854, and
organised in that city the first provincial exhibition held in
England. Mr. Smith went out to Australia at the end of 1854, and
joined the staff of the Argus in 1856, as leader-writer,
fine art and dramatic critic, and has been uninterruptedly
connected with that journal ever since. In the first-named capacity
he called public attention to the importance of forming reservoirs
and introducing artificial irrigation, and also of preserving the
mountain forests from destruction. He likewise advocated the
institution of a National Gallery, and was one of the founders and
the second editor of Melbourne Punch, also editor of the first
evening paper, The Evening Mail, published in Melbourne. Mr.
Smith was Librarian to the Parliament from 1863 to 1868, when the
office was abolished, because his political opinions were regarded
as hostile to those of the Government of the day. While there he
re-modelled, catalogued, and classified the library. Mr. Smith has
been a public lecturer for thirty-six years, and wrote a three-act
drama, Garibaldi, successfully produced at the Prince of
Wales's Theatre, Melbourne, in 1860, also a farce entitled A
Broil at the Café, played at the Theatre Royal. Mr. Smith has
published "Rural Records" (two editions), 1848; "Oracles from the
British Poets," 1851; "Wilton and its Associations," 1851; "Lights
and Shadows of Artist Life and Character," 1853; "From Melbourne to

the University of Sydney was constituted, he was selected to be the
first Professor of Chemistry and Experimental Physics, a position
which he held for over thirty years. In 1853 he was appointed a
member of the Board of National Education, and served till it was
dissolved by the Public Schools Act of 1866, when he became a
member of the Council of Education constituted thereunder, and was
for a number of years president. In 1874 he was nominated to the
Legislative Council, and strongly advocated the adoption of a
protectionist policy. In 1876 the University of Aberdeen conferred
on him the honorary degree of LL.D., and in 1877 he was created
C.M.G. in recognition of his services in the cause of education. In

School in that city. At the age of twenty he went to Melbourne, in
what was then the Port Phillip district, as assistant teacher at
the Church of England Aboriginal Station. Subsequently he became a
publican, and built the Queen's Theatre, which was practically the
first erected in Melbourne. In 1842 Melbourne was incorporated a
city, and Mr. Smith was one of the first members of the Council, in
which he continued to hold a seat till his death. He was seven
times Mayor of Melbourne, and in this capacity took an active part
in providing against the assault on the banks and Treasury in
Melbourne which was supposed to be meditated by the Ballarat
rioters in 1854. For the latter service he received the thanks of
the Governor, Sir Charles Hotham. When Mayor in 1858 he was
delegated by the City Council to go to England for the purpose of
presenting an address of congratulation to the Queen on the
occasion of the marriage of the Princess Royal to the late Emperor
Frederick of Germany, then Crown Prince of Prussia. From the
establishment of constitutional government in Victoria, he was a
member of the Legislature, being elected to the Legislative
Council, then the only chamber, for North Bourke in 1851. Two years
later he resigned his seat and contested the vacancy in the
representation of Melbourne caused by Mr. Westgarth's departure for
Europe. His opponent was the late Mr. Lauchlan Mackinnon, one of
the proprietors of the Argus, whom he defeated. When
responsible government was conceded, Mr. Smith was elected to the
first Legislative Assembly as one of the members for Melbourne in
1856. In 1859 he was returned for Creswick, and subsequently for
West Bourke, which he represented till his death, when he was
"father of the House." He was Minister of Mines in
the Macpherson Government from Sept. 1869 to April 1870.
He was the first Freemason initiated in Victoria, and was appointed
Provincial Grand Master under the Irish constitution. Mr. Smith
took an active part in the establishment of the
principal charities, such as the Melbourne Hospital, the
Benevolent and Orphan Asylums, and others. He was an advocate for
reducing the hours of labour, and contributed to the adoption of
the eight hours system. Mr. Smith died in 1878.</p>

was born in London in 1830, and educated at St. Saviour's Grammar
School and at the Ecole de Médecine at Paris, where in 1848 he had
some exciting adventures during the revolution which deposed Louis
Philippe. Subsequently Mr. Smith studied medicine in London, where
he won honours at the Westminster Hospital, and having taken his
diploma and practised for a while in London, emigrated to Victoria,
where, after a brief experience on the goldfields, he settled down
to practice in Melbourne. In 1859 he was asked to stand for the
Assembly for South Bourke in the Liberal interest, and having
consented, was returned and several times re-elected. Incensed by
some remarks from one of the Ministry of the day which he regarded
as personally insulting, Mr. Smith boxed his assailant's ears, and
immediately resigning his seat, was promptly re-elected, despite
his breach of the decorum of Parliament. Having opposed the Darling
grant, he was defeated for South Bourke, and became member for
Richmond, where he experienced a like fate through his hostility to
Mr. Francis's scheme for reforming Parliament on the lines of the
Norwegian Constitution. In May 1877 he was elected for Richmond at
the head of the poll as an adherent of
the Berry Government. More recently he has represented
Mornington, for which he was re-elected in April 1892. Mr. Smith
has been prominent for many years past as a supporter of the turf

C.M.G., M.A., sometime Agent-General for Victoria, is the son of
the late Alexander Smith, of Liverpool, and was born in 1831. He
was educated at Repton School and at Oriel College, Oxford, of
which he became scholar, but relinquished the further prosecution
of a university course, owing to family reasons rendering it
desirable for him to go into commerce. In 1883, however, the
University conferred on him the honorary degree of M.A. Having
emigrated to Victoria in 1854, he took a leading part in
public affairs as a Conservative and Free-trader, and was returned
to the Legislative Assembly for St. Kilda in 1873. Four years later
he was defeated at the General Election, which placed
the Berry party in power, but was returned for Boroondara
later in 1877, at the bye-election rendered necessary by the death
of Mr. G. P. Smith. His opponent on this occasion was Mr. Knipe, an
auctioneer in Melbourne, whom he defeated by a large majority. Mr.
Smith had meantime been a partner in the mercantile firm of
Turnbull, Smith &amp; Co., and on retiring from the concern was for
some years manager of the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency
Company's business in Melbourne. Mr. Murray Smith is a man of
considerable literary taste, and has contributed to
the Melbourne Review. He was also one of the trustees of
the Argus newspaper nominated under the will of the late
Edward Wilson. In 1881 Mr. Murray Smith, who had been associated
with Mr. Francis in the joint leadership of the Conservative
Opposition, took an active part in support of Sir Bryan
O'Loghlen's motion of want of confidence in the third Berry
Ministry, and when it was carried, and the Government retired, it
was anticipated that he might assume the premiership. Ultimately,
however, the O'Loghlen Ministry was formed, and Mr. Murray Smith
did not take political office. The next year, however, he was
appointed Agent-General of the colony of Victoria in London, and
held the position until Feb. 1886, when his term was renewed at his
own request for one year only. As Agent-General Mr. Murray Smith
took a prominent part in the negotiations respecting the annexation
of New Guinea, the influx of Recedivists into the islands of the
Western Pacific, the Anglo-French control of the New Hebrides, and
the passage through the Imperial Parliament of the Federal Council
of Australasia Bill. Prior to his leaving England in the early part
of 1886, he was entertained at a public banquet at the Freemasons'
Tavern, presided over by the Duke of Cambridge and attended by all
the leading colonists and persons connected with the Australasian
colonies in London. Mr. Murray Smith has not re-entered Parliament
since his return to Victoria. He married in 1858 Jane, daughter of

mining interest, he began to acquire that ascendency in the local
politics of the goldfields' city, which he for many years
maintained. He was first returned to the Assembly for Ballarat
West, in conjunction with the ex-Premier of Victoria,
Mr. Duncan Gillies, and after a brief retirement stood
again in 1871, when he was returned, and represented the
constituency without intermission till April 1892, when he was
defeated. Lieut.-Colonel Smith, who holds that rank in the local
forces, early identified himself with the volunteer movement, and
distinguished himself in Parliament by his mastery of the Local
Government question. He was Minister of Mines in Mr. (now
Sir) Graham Berry's first Government from August to Oct. 1875,
and held the same office in conjunction with that of Minister of
Education in that gentleman's second Cabinet from May 1877 to March
1880. He also acted as Treasurer during his chief's absence in
England on the famous "Embassy" from Dec. 1878 to Nov. 1879. In Mr.
Berry's third Administration Colonel Smith was Minister of
Education from August 1880 to July 1881. He was one of the
delegates to the Federation Convention held in Sydney in March
1891, and the next year lost his seat for Ballarat.</p>

was born at Stockwell, near London, and went in 1852 to Melbourne,
where he attached himself to commercial pursuits. Subsequently, he
became a contributor to the Melbourne Punch and
ultimately editor. He was also prominently connected with two
short-lived and long defunct
journals &mdash;the Spectator and Touchstone. For
some years preceding his death Mr. Smith was one of the principal
political leader-writers of the Melbourne Argus. He died in

<p><a name="A1272" id="A1272"></a><b>Smith, Right Rev. William
Saumarez</b>, D.D., Bishop of Sydney and Primate of Australia, is
the son of the Rev. William Snowden Smith, Prebendary of
Chichester, and Mary Anne, his wife, daughter or J. Robin, of
Jersey. He was born at St. Heliers in 1836, and married in 1870
Florence, daughter of Rev. Lewis Deedes, rector of Bramfield, who
died in 1890, on the eve of her departure for New South Wales. He
was educated at Marlborough College and at Trinity College,
Cambridge, of which he was scholar and became Fellow in 1860. He
graduated B.A. in 1858, taking a first class in classics and
theology, M.A. in 1862, B.D. in 1871, and received the degree of
D.D. in 1889. He was a most successful prizeman during his
university career. The Bishop was ordained deacon in 1859, priest
in 1860, and was chaplain to the Bishop of Madras from 1861 to
1865, curate of Holy Trinity, Cambridge, in 1866, vicar of
Trumpington from 1867 to 1869, and was appointed examining chaplain
to the Bishop of Norwich in the latter year and Honorary Canon of
Chester in 1880. He was Principal of St. Aidan's College from 1869
to 1889, when he was elected to the see of Sydney . Difficulties,
however, arose owing to the fact that he received a less number of
votes than another candidate, who declined the appointment,
whereupon Dr. Saumarez Smith was declared duly elected without a
fresh election. Several of the principal Australian bishops
protested that the nomination was invalid, the Archbishop of
Canterbury declining to issue the necessary authority for his
consecration. In the result he voluntarily withdrew his claim to
the see, and was then duly elected and consecrated in 1890 as
Metropolitan of the province and Primate of Australia. He is the
author of a number of theological works, of which the principal are
"Obstacles to Missionary Success" (Maitland prize essay for 1867)
(1878); "Christian Faith" (five sermons preached before the
university of Cambridge) (1869); "Lessons on the Book of Genesis"
(1879).</p>

<p><a name="A1273" id="A1273"></a><b>Smyth, Robert Brough</b>,
A.M.I.C.E., F.L.S., F.G.S., geologist and mineralogist, was born at
Carville, near Newcastle, Northumberland, in 1830. His father, the
late Edward Smith, was a mining engineer of repute and grandson on
the maternal side of the late Barnabas Brough, who, with his
brother, William Brough, were eminent engineers in their day. He
received his early education at Whickham, in the county of Durham,
and subsequently turned his attention to the study of natural
science, chemistry, and geology. Mr. Smyth commenced his working
life as an assistant at the Derwent Iron Works, where he remained
over five years, emigrating to Victoria in 1852. After some
experience on the goldfields, he entered the Survey Department as
draughtsman, under Captain (now Sir Andrew) Clarke, R.E.
Subsequently Mr. Smyth acted for a brief period as chief
draughtsman, and in 1854 was appointed to take charge of the
meteorological observations. Whilst acting as Director of
Observatories, Mr. Smyth was appointed in 1858 secretary to the
Board of Science, a position which required him to take charge of
the mining surveys of the colony. He was in 1860 appointed
Secretary for Mines, and held office until the beginning of 1876,
when, owing to the result of an inquiry into his treatment of his
official subordinates, he resigned the several offices he held
under Government. Whilst in the public service, Mr. Brough Smyth
acted for some time as Chief Inspector of Mines, and reorganised
the Geological Survey, of which he was Director until his
retirement from official life. Mr. Smyth was the author of "The
Prospector's Handbook," "Goldfields and Mineral Districts of
Victoria," and "The Manners and Customs of the Aboriginal Natives
of Australia," published at the expense of the Government of
Victoria. Mr. Brough Smyth had a good deal to do with the
disastrous "boom" in Indian gold mines. He died on Oct. 10th,
1889.</p>

<p><a name="A1274" id="A1274"></a><b>Smythe, Robert Sparrow</b>,
was born in London, and arrived in Melbourne in 1855. For seven
years he was connected with the press in Victoria, New South Wales
and South Australia, occupying himself as a musical and dramatic
critic, editor of a squatting newspaper, and of the first
illustrated journal published in Australia&mdash;the Illustrated
Post, which developed into the Illustrated Australian
News. Commencing his career as a theatrical manager in 1862, he
claims to be the first manager who ever took an artistic company to
Japan, to Simla in the Himalayas, and across the Orange River in
South Africa. His first tour with "professionals," the longest on
record, lasted from May 1863 to Oct. 1868; when he returned to
England, where he lived for about a year, contributing occasionally
to the Cornhill Magazine and the Pall Mall Gazette.
In 1869 he returned to Australia with Daniel E. Bandmann, the
tragedian. For the next three years he managed various musical and
theatrical companies, until in 1872 he was appointed director of
the concerts given at the exhibition held in Melbourne in
connection with the Victorian International Exhibition. In 1873,
the popular entrepreneur discovered Miss M. E. Christian,
a gifted contralto, trained in the Royal Academy of Music, London,
whose interests he never ceased to promote for eighteen years; he
also organised the tour of Madame Arabella Goddard, the English
pianiste. In the following year he introduced the Rev. Charles
Clark, the former minister of Broadmead Chapel at Bristol, as a
popular lecturer in Australia. Having travelled with Mr. Clark for
more than five years in Australia, America, and Africa, Mr. Smythe
saw that the lecture-platform was a popular institution at the
Antipodes, and his ambition since 1879, when he again visited the
old country, has been to "run" celebrities. Beginning with the
lamented Richard Anthony Proctor, the astronomer, he has since
directed the Australian tours of Archibald Forbes, the
war-correspondent, George Augustus Sala, Charles Santley the
eminent baritone, and other notabilities; while more recently the
great explorer, H. M. Stanley, and Max O'Rell lectured through
Australasia under his management. At Nagasiak in Japan, in 1863,
Mr. Smythe married Miss Amelia Bailey, the accomplished soprano of
the concert company with whom he was then travelling.</p>

the Government service in 1850, went to Tasmania in 1855, and was
appointed private secretary to Governor Sir Henry Fox
Young in February of that year. In Oct. 1857 he accepted the
appointment of Under-Secretary, and still holds that office. In
1883 he was made a magistrate of the Territory.</p>

<p><a name="A1276" id="A1276"></a><b>Spain, William</b>, was
appointed by Lord John Russell as commissioner to examine the land
claims of the New Zealand Company in that colony. On the way out he
was wrecked along with Surveyor-General Ligar (q.v.) at
the Cape of Good Hope. The Governor, Sir G. Napier, sent them on in
the Antilla, in which Mr. Spain reached Wellington on Dec.
24th, 1841, his arrival being welcomed by the natives "as a means
of terminating their disputes" with the Company. Colonel Wakefield
appealed to the home Government against Mr. Spain's jurisdiction,
but to no effect; the Government declaring its intention of abiding
by its commissioner's decisions. Mr. Spain found many difficulties
put in his path, and was a long time engaged upon his complicated
work. In the meantime the Wairau massacre occurred, concerning
which the commissioner wrote: "I have arrived at the conclusion
that the conduct of the Company's agents in forcing a survey of the
Wairau can only be regarded as an attempt to set British law at
defiance, and to obtain possession of a tract of land the title to
which was disputed, and at the very time under the consideration of
a commissioner specially appointed to report upon it." Mr. Spain
subsequently had an interview with Rauparaha, the leader in the
massacre. On June 12th, 1844, he delivered his award in regard to
the purchase of land at Waitara in Taranaki. This he decided had
been a legitimate purchase by Captain Hobson from the Waikato
chiefs, and be therefore awarded the New Zealand Company a Crown
grant of 60,000 acres. But the decision was much objected to by the
Ngatiawa tribe, who claimed that the land was in reality theirs,
and had only been conquered by the Waikatos, who, since they did
not occupy, were in their Maori law not possessors. The clamour
raised about this point was so great that Governor Fitzroy,
fearing bloodshed, set aside the award, only giving the Company
3,500 acres. This caused great discontent among the Europeans, and
even Mr. Spain was mortified that one of the few awards he had been
able to make in favour of the New Zealand Company should be set
aside. It was, it may be noted, this Waitara dispute that led
eventually to the wars in 1863 and the following years. At the
time, too, the various awards were the occasion of more or less
trouble on the part of the natives. Mr. Spain left New Zealand
after his work was over, and practised as a solicitor in New South
Wales.</p>

educated at the Royal Naval School, New Cross. He entered the Royal
Marines in 1862, retiring on halfpay in 1869. He served in Japan in
1864 and 1866 with the Royal Marines battalion at the bombardment
of the batteries at the Straits of Simonaski, and carried the
colours at the assault, capture and destruction of the five
batteries, stockade, magazine and barracks, from Sept. 5th to 8th,
1864. In 1871 he became captain in the New South Wales Artillery,
major in 1876, lieut.-colonel in 1885, and subsequently
brevet-colonel. He served with the New South Wales contingent in
the Soudan war in 1885, as second in command under
Major-General Richardson, being thereupon created C.M.G.,
mentioned in despatches, and receiving the medal with clasps and
the Khedive's star. Colonel Spalding married, in 1884, La Valette

Colonel Roberts in the command of the New South Wales
Artillery.</p>

<p><a name="A1278" id="A1278"></a><b>Speight, Richard</b>, late
Chairman of the Railway Commission of Victoria, was brought up from
boyhood in the service of the Midland Railway Company until he
attained a responsible position on the management. In 1883,
the Service-Berry Government having passed an Act
transferring the management of the railways of Victoria from the
political head of the department to a permanent board of three
commissioners, it was decided to obtain the services of a
first-class expert from England as chairman of the embryo board. In
the result the choice fell upon Mr. Speight, and he arrived in
Melbourne on Feb. 11th, 1884, to assume the duties of his
responsible post, his colleagues being two local gentlemen, the
late Mr. Agg and Mr. Ford. The new arrangement appeared to work
excellently for a time, and when Mr. Speight's first term of seven
years was nearing its expiry, negotiations for its extension were
opened with him by the Gillies-Deakin Government. On
their defeat at the end of 1890, Mr. Shiels, the new Minister
of Railways in the Munro Government, assumed a tone
decidedly unfavourable to the commissioners, and introduced a bill,
which was subsequently carried, greatly curtailing their powers by
rendering them more directly amenable to the authority of
Parliament. Construction was to be taken out of their hands, and
their duties were to be confined to practical management. On these
terms Mr. Speight's reappointment was ultimately negotiated, but
friction continued to prevail between the commission and the
political head of the Railway Department. In 1892 Mr. Wheeler, the
Minister of Railways in the Cabinet of which Mr. Shiels had now
become head, demanded of the commissioners the suggestion of a
scheme for effecting a very large retrenchment in the annual cost
of working the state lines. The commission complied, but in a
manner which gave dissatisfaction to the Government, the result
being that they were summarily suspended from office till the
pleasure of Parliament could be made known. When the Houses met
after the General Election in April 1892, an address to the Crown
was carried in the Assembly for the removal of the commissioners.
In the meantime efforts were made to effect a compromise, with the
result that Mr. Speight and his co-commissioners ultimately agreed
with the Government to resign on being paid compensation for loss
of office to the amount of half the salaries which would have
accrued due to them had they continued in office till the expiry of
their renewed engagements. The sum Mr. Speight received was
£5,250.</p>

later French school of fiction. She is connected with the
State Children's Department of South Australia, and is the
authoress of "The Laws we Live under, with some chapters on
Elementary Political Economy and the Duties of Citizens," which was
published in 1881, under the direction of the Minister of Education
of South Australia. Miss Spence was born at Melrose in 1825, and
went to South Australia with her parents in 1839. In 1854 she
published "Clare Morrison, a Tale of the South Australian Gold
Fever"; in 1856 "Tender and True"; in 1865 "Mr. Hogarth's Will";
and in 1868 "The Author's Daughter." "Gathered In," another novel
from her pen, appeared in the Adelaide Observer and
the Queenslander. In 1884 Miss Spence published anonymously in
London "An Agnostic's Progress," written from a theistic point of
view. She is a strong advocate of the Hare system of
representation, and thirty years ago published a pamphlet in
Adelaide entitled "A Plea for Pure Democracy," arguing for its
adoption in South Australia. Miss Spence has taken a practical
interest in the working of the boarding-out system as applied to

<p><a name="A1283" id="A1283"></a><b>Spofforth, Frederick
Robert</b>, the famous cricketer, more familiarly known under the
sobriquet of the "Demon Bowler," is a Yorkshireman by descent, and
is a nephew of Mr. Markham Spofforth, who was well known as a
solicitor and election manager for the English Tory party. His
father emigrated to Sydney, N.S.W., and was highly esteemed in
banking circles there. Mr. Spofforth was born at Balmain, near
Sydney, on Sept. 9th, 1855, and was educated at Eglinton College,
Sydney. He played with the Newtown Club in 1871-2, and subsequently
with the Albert Club in the New South Wales metropolis. At first he
was almost equally esteemed as a batsman and as a bowler, but
gradually became especially distinguished in the latter capacity.
In Jan. 1874 he played for New South Wales in the match at Sydney
against W. G. Grace's team, and took three wickets for fourteen
runs. This was his first considerable performance. He was not,
however, chosen as one of the combined Australian team to meet the
Englishmen during that tour, but in the next season (Dec. 1874) it
was chiefly owing to his bowling that New South Wales was able to
beat Victoria at Melbourne, for the first time for seven years. In
1878 Mr. Spofforth visited England as one of Gregory's team. On
this occasion he thoroughly justified the cognomen of the "Demon
Bowler" which he had already acquired in Australia. He first made a
name in England in the memorable contest with the M.C.C. and
Ground, when he and Boyle together succeeded in getting rid of an
extremely strong batting side for 33 runs in the first and 19 in
the second innings. In the first innings he bowled 23 balls for 4
runs and 6 wickets. During the tour he was credited with as many as
110 wickets at an average of under 10½ runs, besides having the
respectable  batting average of 13 for 28 innings. He paid a
second visit to England with the 1880 team, and though an injury
prevented him playing in the most memorable match of the tour, he
took no less than 391 English wickets at an average of only a
little over 5 runs. He was a member of Murdoch's 1884 team, and
increased his reputation as a bowler by his constant success on the
hard wickets prevalent in England during the tour. His delivery is
right-handed, and from its very nature causes the ball to get up
quickly from the pitch. He has completely learnt perhaps the
greatest secret of bowling&mdash;to vary his pitch without giving the
batsman any clue to his intentions. He was at one time a very fast
bowler, but latterly he has reduced his pace. He is a fair batsman,
a good field, particularly at point, and generally a sure catch. He
played for New South Wales from 1874 to 1885, and for Victoria from
1885 to 1887. Mr. Spofforth was formerly a clerk in the Bank of New
South Wales in Sydney, and was then engaged in squatting pursuits
in Cootamundra, in New South Wales. He is now settled in England,
where he has qualified for Derbyshire.</p>

<p><a name="A1284" id="A1284"></a><b>Sprent, Charles Percy</b>, son
of James Sprent (q.v.), was born at Hobart in 1849. He
was educated at the High School, Hobart, and chose the profession
of a surveyor. In 1871 he was appointed District Surveyor of the
North-western District of Tasmania. In this year, Mr. James Smith's
splendid discovery of tin at Mount Bischoff first revealed the
mineral treasures hidden in the dense forests of the North-West,
and during the next ten years Mr. Sprent did valuable pioneering
work in opening the way for prospectors by his explorations of the
country lying between Mount Bischoff and Macquarie Harbour. In 1876
he penetrated the mineral belt to the east of the Meredith Range,
between Waratale and the Pieman, cutting a track through a dense
tangle of scrub and forest. His explorations did much to assist the
opening up of the rich mineral resources of Western Tasmania. In
1882 he received the appointment of Deputy-Surveyor-General, in
recognition of his services to the Colony. He died at Hobart on
June 20th, 1887. Mr. Sprent wrote for the Royal Geographical
Society of Australasia an interesting paper on "Recent Explorations
on the West Coast of Tasmania" (1885), also a paper on "Antarctic
Exploration" in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Tasmania
(1886).</p>

to Governor Sir George Arthur's children. In 1832 he was appointed
District Surveyor. From 1842 to 1846 he was employed in surveying
the Van Diemen's Land Company's estates. Between the years 1849 and
1857 Mr. Sprent took the leading part in the trigonometrical survey
of the island, which he accomplished almost single-handed, and with

Lieut.-Col. Patrick Duff Tytler, was born on April 23rd, 1820,
in Edinburgh, and educated at Trinity College, Dublin. In 1843 he
went out to Nelson, N.Z., and at once began to take a prominent
part in public affairs, being twice Superintendent of the province
of Nelson. Mr. Stafford formed a Government on June 2nd, 1856, in
succession to Mr. Fox, and was Colonial Secretary in what was
practically the first definite administration in New Zealand from
Nov. 4th, 1856, to July 12th, 1861. During his premiership the
trouble with regard to the famous Waitara block reached a head, and
a sort of irregular war was prosecuted against the chief Te
Rangitake. On August 16th, 1860, the Government carried through a
resolution in favour of the prosecution of the war, and stood
committed to a war policy, despite the opposition and entreaty of
Bishop Selwyn. But the matter went little further at the
moment, as in July 1861 the Ministry were defeated on a want of
confidence motion moved by Mr. Fox. Upon the resignation of the Fox
Ministry in August 1862, Mr. Stafford refused to take office. In
1859 Mr. Stafford had visited England with the objects of
establishing a steam mail service from New
Zealand viâ Panama, and of arranging for the planting of
military settlements in the North Island. Lord Derby went so far as
to call for tenders for the steam service, but his successor, Lord
Palmerston, refused to go on with the scheme. Nor was Mr. Stafford
more successful in regard to the military settlements. On Oct.
16th, 1865, he again became Premier, and held the office of
Colonial Secretary till June 28th, 1869, that of Colonial Treasurer
till June 12th, 1866, that of Postmaster-General from Oct. 31st,
1865, to May 8th, 1866, and from Feb. 6th to June 28th, 1869. The
Maori troubles lasted most of this time, and Mr. Stafford had to
cope with them as best he could. In 1869 the Imperial troops were
withdrawn from the colony, notwithstanding the Premiers protest.
For a third time he became Premier on Sept. 10th, 1872, but a month
later (Oct. 11th) resigned upon a no-confidence motion carried by
Mr. Vogel. He was created K.C.M.G. in 1879, and G.C.M.G. in
1887. For many years past he has lived in England; and in 1886 he
was commissioner for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition. Sir Edward
Stafford married first, Sept. 24th, 1846, Emily Charlotte, only
child of Colonel William Wakefield and Emily Elizabeth, daughter of

Artillery, in which he served for nine years, and retired with the
rank of captain. He went to Victoria in 1852, and in 1854 was
appointed assistant Commissioner of Goldfields at Sandhurst, and in
1858 Chinese Protector. On the resignation of Sir Charles
Macmahon he was made Chief Commissioner of the Police. This
post he resigned in 1880. Captain Standish in 1861 was installed

on Sept. 3rd, 1835. He was educated at Hertford College, Oxford,
and graduated B.A. in 1858 and M.A. in 1862, receiving the honorary
degree of Doctor of Divinity in 1878. He was ordained deacon in
1858 and priest in 1859, and was curate of Christ's Church,
Rotherhithe, from 1858 to 1862; of All Saints', Maidstone, from
1862 to 1864, of St. Saviour's, Fitzroy Square, London, from 1864
to 1867; and vicar of Holy Trinity, St. Giles-in-the-Fields,
London, from 1867 to 1878; on June 24th in which year he was
consecrated first Bishop of North Queensland, in St. Paul's
Cathedral, by Archbishop Tait and Bishops Jackson, Browne, Thorold,
and Barker (of Sydney). A few months later Bishop Stanton
left for his new diocese, where no difficulties in the way of
travelling, whether over trackless bush or swollen rivers, ever
daunted him in the discharge of his duties in a truly pastoral and
missionary spirit. In 1888 Bishop Stanton visited England to attend
the Pan-Anglican Conference, held at Lambeth in that year, and took
the opportunity to appeal to English liberality on behalf of his
diocese, which, with a view to its more efficient working, he
proposed to divide. In Nov. 1890, much to the regret of his North
Queensland flock, Dr. Stanton accepted the bishopric of Newcastle,
N.S.W., vacant by the resignation of Dr. Pearson (q.
v.).</p>

<p><a name="A1292" id="A1292"></a><b>Stawell, Hon. Sir William
Foster</b>, K.C.M.G., LL.D., was the son of Jonas Stawell, of Old
Court, in the county of Cork, and of Anna, daughter of the Right
Rev. William Foster, Bishop of Clogher, in Ireland. He was born on
June 27th, 1815. He entered the University of Dublin, where after a
distinguished under-graduate course he took the degree of B.A. in
1837. Then he studied law in London, was called to the Irish Bar in
1839, and was admitted to the Melbourne Bar in 1842, when he
combined professional with pastoral pursuits in partnership with
his cousin Mr. Foster Fitzgerald. Mr. Stawell quickly attained
eminence in his profession, being retained in every case of
importance, and here it may be remarked that very few of his
judgments, after his elevation to the bench, have been reversed on
appeal to the Privy Council. Notwithstanding his constant work both
before and after his accession to office, he devoted a large
portion of his time and influence to the promotion of religious and
charitable objects, being the author of the Act establishing the
Church of England Synod, of which body he was a member till his
death. No man gave a more cordial support to
Bishop Perry in his arduous task of organising the newly
established diocese of Melbourne, and no one gave greater attention
to the promotion of education, which he always maintained should be
based upon religion. He was Chancellor of the University of
Melbourne and Trustee of the Public Library, in both of which
institutions he felt a vivid interest. In all matters of public
importance he took a prominent part, notably in the
anti-transportation agitation; and when Victoria was created an
independent colony in 1857, he, with general approval,
was appointed Attorney-General by Mr. La Trobe. In that office
he soon won the influence which his abilities merited and gained
the esteem and confidence of his strongest political opponents. The
difficulties of that period, enhanced by the "gold fever," can
never be appreciated by those who did not witness them. The
organisation of all the branches of the Government service, in a
community where no official materials existed, was almost an
impossibility, and this duty devolved on a number of young men who
themselves had received no official training. Their success was
marvellous, and in this arduous task none took a more prominent
part than Mr. Stawell. After the introduction of responsible
government he continued to act as Attorney-General under
Mr. Haines as Premier, having been elected as one of the
members for the city of Melbourne in 1856, and in March 1857 he
obtained his well-won appointment as Chief Justice of Victoria. In
1873 he took two years' leave of absence, and revisited his native
land, where he was admitted a Doctor of Laws by the University of
Dublin. Soon after his return he administered the Government during
the absence of Sir George Bowen, and subsequently was
appointed Lieut.-Governor of the Colony. From 1880 to 1886 he
filled the office of Judge to the Vice-Admiralty Court. About this
date also he acted as President of the Commission which passed the
Judicature Acts, assimilating as far as possible, English law and
practice to the circumstances of the colony. On his retirement from
the bench, in 1886, he was created K.C.M.G. In 1856 he married Mary
Frances Elizabeth, only daughter of W. P. Green, R.N. He died at
Naples, in Italy, on March 12th, 1889.</p>

<p><a name="A1293" id="A1293"></a><b>Steel, Rev. Robert</b>, D.D.,
Ph.D., is of Scotch extraction, but was born at Pontypool,
Monmouthshire, in 1827. He was educated at the Ayr Academy and at
the Aberdeen and Edinburgh Universities, being licensed to preach
by the Free Presbytery of Irvine in 1851. He subsequently held
various charges, being transferred to Halford in 1855 and to
Cheltenham in 1859. He meanwhile contributed to the religious
press, and was the originator and for four years one of the
editors, of Meliora, a quarterly periodical of social science.
In 1861 he was created Ph.D. of the University of Göttingen, and in
the same year was appointed to the pastorate of the Macquarie
Street church, Sydney, where he arrived in June 1862. Subsequently
he took a leading part in promoting the union of the Presbyterian
churches of New South Wales, and was elected Moderator of the third
General Assembly in 1867. He was actively interested in the
establishment of St. Andrews College, and he has been one of the
General Assembly's tutors in theology. For five years he edited
the Presbyterian, a weekly paper in Sydney. In 1869 he was
adjudged guilty of contempt of court for having published a letter
from a missionary exposing the evils of the Polynesian labour
traffic, and which it turned out had reference to the proceedings
of a captain who was awaiting trial for the murder of kidnapped
South Sea Islanders. The Chief Justice, Sir Alfred Stephen,
dissented from the decision, and Dr. Steel was the object of much
popular sympathy, evidenced by addresses and presentations. He was
created D.D. by Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, and in 1874 was
transferred to the pastorate of St. Stephen's Church, Phillip
Street, Sydney, which he still holds. In the same year Dr. Steel
visited the New Hebrides, in the Dayspring, in order to see
the working of the missions, in which he had always taken a deep
interest, and published a book on the subject in 1880. Amongst
other works, Dr. Steel is author of the following: "Doing Good, or
the Christian in Walks of Usefulness"(1858); "Samuel the Prophet,
and the Lessons of his Life and Times" (1860); "Lives made Sublime
by Faith and Work" (1861); "Burning and Shining Lights, or Memoirs
of Good Ministers of Jesus Christ" (1864); "The Christian Teacher
in Sunday Schools" (1867); "The Shorter Catechism with Analyses,
Illustrations, and Anecdotes" (1885); and "The Achievements of
Youth" (1891). All the above were published by Messrs. Nelson &amp;
Sons, of Edinburgh. Dr. Steel, who is the son of the late James
Steel and Anne Gillespie his wife, married at Huntly, Scotland, on
Nov. 23rd, 1853, Miss Mary Allardyce.</p>

<p><a name="A1294" id="A1294"></a><b>Stenhouse, Nicol Drysdale</b>,
M.A., a writer of taste and a great lover of literature, was clerk
to Sir William Hamilton when the latter was practising as
an advocate in Edinburgh. He was also a friend of the late
Thomas de Quincey. Having embraced the legal profession, he
emigrated to New South Wales, and practised for many years as an
attorney and solicitor in Sydney. He was a veritable Mæcenas to
many needy and struggling literary men in Sydney. Not long before
his death he was, on the motion of that great scholar, the late Dr.
Badham, appointed an examiner in the Faculty of Law and a member of
the senate of Sydney University. He succeeded the late Dr. Woolley,
with whom he was on warm terms of friendship, as president of the
Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts, and held the position from 1867
to 1873. Mr. Stenhouse died in 1876.</p>

<p><a name="A1295" id="A1295"></a><b>Stephen, Hon. Sir Alfred</b>,
G.C.M.G., C.B., M.L.C., ex-Lieut.-Governor of New South Wales, is
the third son of the late John Stephen (sometime Puisne Judge, New
South Wales, who died in Sydney in 1833), and was born on August
20th, 1802, in the West Indies, but received his education at the
Charterhouse School. He accompanied his father, who was then
Solicitor-General of St. Christopher, to that island, and when only
fifteen served as Second Lieutenant in the local corps of Fusiliers
raised for the defence of the island. In 1818 he returned to
England, and entered at Lincoln's Inn in May of that year, being
called to the bar in Nov. 1823. He practised for a short time as an
equity draftsman, and in 1824, having married Virginia, daughter of
Matthew Consett, a merchant of London, emigrated to Van Diemen's
Land (now Tasmania), where in April 1825 he assumed office as Crown
Solicitor and Solicitor-General. In April 1832, whilst on his
passage to England, he was gazetted Attorney-General, and
discharged the duties of that office from 1833 to 1839, in April of
which year he was appointed by Sir George Gipps, Governor-General
of New South Wales, a Judge of the Supreme Court of that colony. In
Oct. 1844 he succeeded Sir James Bowling as Chief Justice of New
South Wales, and was knighted in August 1846. Ten years later, on
the initiation of parliamentary government, he was nominated to the
legislative Council, and was president of that body from May 1856
to Jan. 1857, when he resigned the chair of the house, and his seat
in the following year. Sir Alfred was president of the New South
Wales Commission for the Paris International Exhibition in 1855,
and was created C.B. in 1862. In 1872 he administered the
government of the colony during the interregnum which occurred
between the departure of Lord Belmore and the arrival of Sir
Hercules Robinson; and in the next year he resigned the Chief
Justiceship and retired on a pension of £1820 per annum. In the
following year he was created K.C.M.G., and in Nov. 1875, by royal
warrant, Lieut.-Governor of New South Wales "with succession to the
government as administrator thereof on the death or absence of the
Governor." He has been a member of the Legislative Council
continuously since March 1875, with the exception of some short
intervals during which he has been discharging vice-regal
functions, when he has formally resigned and been successively
reappointed. Sir Alfred Stephen, who is a member of the council and
of the senate of Sydney University, a trustee of the Australian
Museum, of the National Art Gallery and of the public parks, and a
director of the Prince Alfred Hospital, was a member of the Board
of National Education until its dissolution in 1866, and was
vice-president of the Sydney International Exhibition of 1879. His
first wife having died in 1837, he married secondly, in 1839,
Eleanor, daughter of the late Rev. William Bedford, D.D., Senior
Chaplain of Tasmania, who died in 1886. He was created G.C.M.G. in
1884. Before 1825&mdash; the year of Sir Alfred Stephen's first
appointment in Van Diemen's Land&mdash;that colony was, as the "Colonial
Office List" points out, mainly a receptacle for convicts. A free
immigrant population, however, had commenced, and in 1825 the
colony obtained an independent legislature. Legislation on a
multiplicity of subjects became necessary, from the most primitive
to the creating of courts, the introduction of jury trials, and the
prevention and punishment of crime. In the preparation and passing
of these measures, in suggestions to the Government respecting
penal discipline, and other legal questions, he had a large share.
For these services he received the thanks of Sir George Arthur, the
Lieut.-Governor, with a recommendation for advancement. On
appointment to New South Wales he received addresses signed by
nearly every member of the Tasmanian parliament and magistracy, and
from the leading colonists and the bar, accompanied by the
presentation of pieces of plate. He sat on the bench of New South
Wales for thirty-two years, adding to his judicial duties the
authorship of several legislative measures&mdash;among them the Titles
to Land Act, and the Criminal Law Consolidation and Amendment Act.
In 1879 he advised on the remodelling of letters patent to
governors, and framed the new clauses in them and in the royal
instructions. On his retirement from the position of Chief Justice,
in 1873, he was presented with addresses by his brother judges,
several bodies of the magistracy, the bar, and solicitors; and by
the public with a purse of a thousand guineas and his bust in
marble, which was placed by the Legislative Council on the walls of
their chamber. Sir Alfred Stephen may be regarded as the originator
of those alterations in the Marriage Law of Australia which have
tended to place women on an equality with men in the matter of
divorce, and have extended to them a measure of protection in case
of the prolonged brutality, drunkenness or imprisonment of their
husbands, which is as yet only a matter of hope in the United
Kingdom on the part of the champions of their sex. In 1891 Sir
Alfred Stephen retired from the position of Lieutenant-Governor on
the plea of age and infirmities, and was thanked by the Colonial
Office in a special despatch to the Governor.</p>

<p><a name="A1296" id="A1296"></a><b>Stephen, Sir George</b>, Q.C.,
was the youngest son of the late James Stephen, C.B., who held
various official appointments in the West Indies and elsewhere, and
who was subsequently M.P. for Tralee and East Grinstead, and a
Master in Chancery for twenty years, by his marriage with Ann, only
child of Henry Stent, of Stoke Newington. He was the brother of the
late Right Hon. Sir James Stephen, for many years Under-Secretary
of State in the Colonial Office, whose policy he for a long period
initiated and controlled. Born in 1794 at St. Kitts, he was
originally intended for the medical profession; but after spending
three years in the study of anatomy, and going through a two-years'
course at Magdalen College, Cambridge, which he left without
graduating, after doing brilliant work, he entered the office of
Messrs. Kaye &amp; Freshfield, solicitors to the Bank of England.
Having served his articles, he commenced practice on his own
account, and was engaged by the Government to obtain evidence
against Queen Caroline, of whose guilt he was fully assured. It
was, however, in connection with the movement for the abolition of
slavery in the British colonies that he mainly distinguished
himself. His father (James Stephen) had married, as his second
wife, the sister of William Wilberforce, and was allied with that
great man, the elder Macaulay, Clarkson, and others in the
abolition of the slave trade, achieved in 1807. In the legitimate
development of that noble work, which ended in the suppression of
slavery, as well as of the slave trade, throughout the British
dominions. Sir George Stephen bore a leading part, and it was his
decision (extorted from him by the necessities of the case) in
favour of admitting the principle of compensation that brought the
agitation to a much earlier successful issue than could otherwise
have been ensured. Sir George (who was knighted in 1837, being the
first so honoured after the Queen's accession) subsequently ceased
to practise as a solicitor, with a view to being called to the Bar.
This was accomplished, in 1849, under the auspices of Gray's Inn;
and Sir George then removed to Liverpool, where he practised at the
local Bar for some years. Business falling off, he determined to
follow his two sons to Australia, and took up his residence in
Melbourne in 1855. Though this step was afterwards a matter of
regret with him, he did fairly well at the Victorian Bar,
principally in insolvency cases, and became a Q.C. in 1871. In 1866
he acted as Commissioner of Insolvent Estates at Geelong. Sir
George (who was a cousin of Sir Alfred Stephen) married, in
1821, Henrietta, eldest daughter of the Rev. William Ravenscroft,
Prebendary of Down Cathedral, Ireland, who died in 1871. He died on
20th June, 1879. In addition to an autobiography written for his
children, Sir George published, in 1839, anonymously, "Adventures
of an Attorney in Search of a Practice"; and was also the author of
"The Jesuit at Cambridge," published the same year; and of
"Adventures of a Gentleman in Search of a Horse," a brochure
intended to illustrate in an amusing form the operation of the
warranty law, which ran through half a dozen editions. Sir George
also wrote several orthodox law books and a "Life of Christ." Mr.
Justice FitzJames Stephen and Mr. Leslie Stephen are nephews of Sir
George Stephen, being the sons of his brother, the late Right Hon.
Sir James Stephen.</p>

Advocate-General from February to July 1838, and as senior member
of the Legislative Council, was Acting-Governor of the colony
during the interval between the departure of Captain (afterwards
Admiral Sir John) Hindmarsh, and the arrival of Colonel
Gawler, July to Oct. 1838. He was Colonial Secretary from Oct. 1838
to July 1839, and was appointed a member of the board which
replaced the Resident Commissioner in Oct. 1838. Mr. Stephen having
entered into speculations in land at Port Gawler, was involved in
criminal charges of which he was acquitted; but comments
unfavourable to his conduct having appeared in the South
Australian Register, he brought an action for libel against the
proprietary, in which the latter secured a verdict. Visiting
England, he entered as a student at the Middle Temple in June 1842,
and was called to the English bar in Nov. 1845, and to that of New
South Wales in April 1852. He subsequently resided in Melbourne,
but has lived in London for some years past. Mr. Stephen, who has
gained considerable notoriety by his practice of the art of "faith

1830, received his education at Marlborough College, proceeding
thence to Oxford in 1850. Here he entered first at Queen's College,
where his elder brother, the late Professor Stephens, of Sydney
University, was afterwards Fellow and Tutor; but subsequently
obtained a scholarship at Magdalen Hall, now Hertford College. In
1854, he took his B.A. degree, and ten years later received that of
M.A. In 1855 Mr. Stephens emigrated to Victoria, intending to
follow pastoral pursuits, but was attracted to Tasmania in the
following year, and in 1857 accepted the appointment of Inspector
of Schools under the Northern Board of Education. On the
amalgamation of the Northern and Southern Boards in 1863 he was
appointed Inspector of Schools for the Colony, a title subsequently
altered to Chief Inspector of Schools. While occupying this
position, Mr. Stephens had a large and important share in the
organisation of the system of primary education, and was the first
to introduce a standard of instruction for the schools, and a
scheme of classification for teachers. On the passing of the
Education Act in 1885, which placed the Department under the direct

when he was appointed to the Legislative Council, in which he still
holds a seat. Mr. Stevens, who was a strong Free-trader and
opponent of provincialism from the time he entered public life, is
understood to have been the real originator of the "Public Trust
Office," of which Sir Julius Vogel was the legislative
sponsor. In Oct. 1887 he accepted office in
the Atkinson administration without portfolio, resigning
with his colleagues in Dec. 1891.</p>

<p><a name="A1306" id="A1306"></a><b>Stevenson, George</b>, was
born at Berwick-on-Tweed on April 13th, 1799, and went to sea in an
East Indiaman commanded by his uncle. Not liking the life, he
returned to Scotland, and obtained a rudimentary knowledge of
medicine. He then had a varied experience in Canada, Central
America and the West Indies; and ultimately became connected with
the literary staff of the London Globe. Returning to England
in 1830, he wrote a work entitled "France," in conjunction with the
late Sir Henry Bulwer, afterwards Lord Dalling. In 1835 he
succeeded Mr. John Gorton as editor of the Globe; but becoming
strongly impressed with the virtues of the Wakefield system of
colonisation, he decided to emigrate to South Australia, and
obtained the position of private secretary to Captain (afterwards
Sir) John Hindmarsh, the first Governor. Prior to his
departure from England, in June 1836, he married Miss Margaret
Gorton, and also entered into a partnership with Mr. Robert Thomas
for the production of a newspaper in the new colony, of which he
was to be editor and Mr. Thomas manager and printer. In pursuance
of this arrangement the first number of the South Australian
Gazette and Colonial Register was issued in London on June
18th, 1836. It contained all the official notices of the new
colony, with an addendum of general news. The second number was
published in Adelaide on June 3rd, 1837; and in it was notified Mr.
Stevenson's appointment as clerk of the Council and a justice of
the peace. Soon after Governor Gawler's appointment, in 1838,
Mr. Stevenson resigned his various official posts; and
the Gazette was separated from what now became
the South Australian Register, of which Mr. Stevenson
continued editor till 1842, when the disastrous financial crisis
compelled him to sever his connection with the paper. He
subsequently established the South Australian Gazette and
Mining Journal, which he conducted with much ability till the
crisis occasioned by the discovery of gold in Victoria, when it was
dropped. Mr. Stevenson, who was subsequently coroner of Adelaide
and its suburbs, was the defendant in a libel action
brought against him by Mr. George Milner Stephen, acting
Governor of the colony, on the strength of some comments which, as
editor of the Register, he had made on that gentleman's land
transactions at Gawler. However, Mr. Stephen was nonsuited. Mr.
Stevenson died at North Adelaide on Oct. 18th, 1856.</p>

Stirling, of Drumpellier, oo. Lanark, by Anne, only daughter of Sir
Walter Stirling, Bart., of Faskine, co. Lanark, was born at
Drumpellier in 1791. Having entered the navy, and served with
distinction during the French and American wars, he was employed in
the survey of the Australian coast, and was the first to cross the
Monaro plains in New South Wales. In 1827 he was sent by Governor
Darling to what is now Western Australia, with the dual view of
selecting a suitable site for a penal settlement on the Swan River,
and of anticipating the French in their reported intention to annex
that portion of the mainland of Australia. H.M.S. Success, of
which he was in command, dropped anchor on March 6th; and so
favourable was his report of the capabilities of the country that
on his return to Sydney he was sent back to England with a despatch
from Sir Ralph Darling recommending the formation of a settlement
on the Swan River. In the result the Imperial Government adopted
the suggestion, and appointed Captain Stirling Governor of the
inchoate settlement, with a grant of 100,000 acres of land for his
services in exploring it. When, after narrowly escaping shipwreck,
Captain Stirling landed on June 1st, 1829 (from which time his
administration as Governor dated), with the first band of British
colonists, the hopes formed from a previous hasty inspection of the
land near the coast were far from being realised. Imperfectly
sheltered in tents and huts, the colonists remained for months at
Garden Island, ultimately selecting Perth as the site of the
capital and Fremantle as the port of the settlement. In 1830 a
thousand additional settlers arrived, and towards the end of the
year the capital was rendered suitable for habitation. Captain
Stirling did much valuable exploring work; but all his efforts were
unavailing to prevent the disastrous failure of the settlement. His
first term of office as Governor expired in Sept. 1832, when
he left the colony to render an account of his stewardship to the
Home Government. This he most have done satisfactorily, as he was
knighted, and two years later was again appointee! Governor of the
settlement, which had been administered during his absence by
Captains Irwin and Daniel. On his return, in August 1834,
experience enabled him to repair past errors; and so energetic was
his administration that he not only prevented the projected
abandonment of the colony, but put it in a fair way of future
success. Sir James finally resigned the Governorship in Dec. 1838,
and, resuming the naval profession, was a Junior Lord of the
Admiralty for a short time in 1852, and Commander-in-Chief of the
Chinese squadron during the Russian war. He died on April 22nd,
1865.</p>

1837. After engaging in farming pursuits, he went to the Victorian
diggings in 1856, and to the Northern Territory in 1864. In the
following year he formed one of a party of seven who sailed from
Adam Bay in the Northern Territory to Champion Bay in Western
Australia in a small ship's boat named the Forlorn Hope. An
account of this expedition was published by Mr. Stow, who in 1876
was appointed editor of the South Australian

who was born at Hadleigh, Suffolk, on July 7th, 1801, emigrated to
South Australia in 1837, and became the first minister of the
Congregational Church erected in North Terrace, Adelaide. He was,
in fact, the first regular clergyman of any religious body who
officiated in South Australia, with the exception of the Rev. C. B.
Howard, the Colonial Chaplain. The church in North Terrace was
built of pines and reeds, Mr. Stow assisting the labourers in the
erection of the building. In England he had commenced his pastorate
at Framlingham, Suffolk, and afterwards preached at Buntingford in
Hertfordshire, and at Halstead in Essex, leaving the latter place
to go to South Australia under the auspices of the Colonial
Missionary Society. For a short time after his arrival in Adelaide,
in Oct. 1837 he preached in a tent, and after leaving North Terrace
occupied the pulpit of the Freeman Street Church. He died at Sydney
whilst on a visit on July 19th, 1862. Mr. Stow was one of the most
able opponents of the introduction of state aid to religion from
1846 to 1851, and the failure of the attempt was largely owing to
his vigorous efforts. The esteem in which he was held is attested
by the erection of the Stow Memorial Church in Adelaide, which was
built to perpetuate the public esteem in which he was held.</p>

Wales, and when the colony of Victoria was constituted in 1851 he
was returned to the semi-elective Legislative Council, then the
only chamber, as member for Geelong in October of that year. After
responsible government was conceded in 1855, Mr. Strachan was
elected to the first wholly elective Legislative Council for the

<p><a name="A1321" id="A1321"></a><b>Strangways, Hon. Henry Bull
Templer</b>, J. P., sometime Premier of South Australia, eldest son
of the late Henry Bull Strangways, J.P., of Shapwick, Somerset, was
born in 1832, and emigrated to South Australia. Revisiting England,
he entered at the Middle Temple in Nov. 1851, and was called to the
Bar in June 1856. He returned to Adelaide in May of the following
year, and was member for Encounter Bay in the Assembly from 1858 to
1862, and for West Torrens from 1863 to 1870. Mr. Strangways
declined to form a government when the Hanson Ministry
were in difficulties in 1859; but in the following year he took
office as Attorney-General in the Reynolds Government,
which lasted from May 1860 to May 1861, when it was reconstructed,
and held office till the following October, Mr. Strangways, in the
meantime, exchanging the post of Attorney-General for that of
Minister of Lands and Immigration. In this capacity he settled the
vexed question as to the ownership of the Moonta Mines on a basis
which legal decisions subsequently upheld. He was always an
advocate of exploration, and as a Minister supervised the fitting
out of the expeditions of John McDouall Stuart and Mackinlay. The
Waterhouse Ministry, which took office on the final retirement of
Mr. Reynolds from the premiership, only lasted a few days, and was
then reconstructed on a broader basis, Mr. Strangways being taken
in in his old post of Minister of Lands and Immigration. On this
occasion he held office till July 1863. In 1862 a question arose as
to the appointment of a gentlemen, not a responsible minister, as a
member of the Executive Council. Mr. Strangways therefore suggested
to the then Governor, Sir Dominic Daly, that the Executive Council
should be placed on the same basis as the Privy Council in England,
and that a few colonists of eminence and position should be
appointed to it, but that they should not attend meetings unless
summoned, as is now the case in Victoria. This view was not adopted
by the Colonial Office, but instead an intimation was given in 1863
that ministers who had served more than three years would in proper
cases be allowed to retain the title of "honourable" within the
colony, and Mr. Strangways himself was one of the first to whom
that permission was granted. In March 1865 he was again appointed
Minister of Lands in the Dutton Ministry; but owing to
some dissatisfaction with their action in appointing the premier to
the post of Agent-General they were ejected, after being
reconstructed under Mr. (now Sir) Henry Ayers, in the
following October. Mr. Strangways took a prominent part in
initiating the State railway system, which has since been so
enormously developed in South Australia. In 1865 he moved for the
appointment of a select committee to inquire into the subject, and
the report was mainly the embodiment of his views. The land
question having come prominently on the tapis, successive
proposals from several short-lived ministries were rejected, and in
Nov. 1868 Mr. Strangways, who had been instrumental in defeating
the last of these abortive projects, was called upon as Premier to
develop a land policy of his own. The result was the passing
of the measure, afterwards known as the Strangways Act, which
provided for the creation of agricultural areas, and which, for the
first time in the history of South Australia, permitted the sale of
Crown lands on credit. Subsequent modifications of the measure have
not been in all cases improvements. In another work of not only
Australasian but of Imperial importance Mr. Strangways may claim to
have played a leading part. Early in 1870 a project was mooted from
England for the establishment of cable communication with
Australia, and special application was made to Sir James
Fergusson, then Governor of South Australia, to use his influence
in effectuating the idea. Sir James requested Mr. Strangways, who
was still in office as Premier and Attorney-General, to take the
matter up, and after careful consideration he consented to do so.
The agent of the English promoters, Captain Noel Osborne, R.N., in
the meantime arrived, and requested permission from the South
Australian Government to make a land line from Palmerston, in the
northern territory of that colony, to Brisbane, in Queensland. Mr.
Strangways promised his aid, but suggested as an alternative that
South Australia should herself construct a land line across the
centre of the continent from Palmerston to Adelaide. Captain
Osborne doubted whether this was feasible, but promised to maintain
silence until Mr. Strangways had sounded his colleagues, whom he
had to convert one by one to what at the first blush everybody in
the colony was inclined to regard as an equally daring and
impracticable feat. When the cabinet had been won over, Mr.
Strangways again approached Sir James Fergusson, who was impressed
with the idea that the other colonies ought to assist in a work of
such importance to them all. His Excellency was just about to start
on a visit to the eastern colonies, and undertook to try to get
their aid. Mr. Strangways stoutly maintained that if the work was
to be done at all, South Australia would have to do it alone; and
the result showed the correctness of this view, New South Wales,
Victoria and Tasmania only giving their good wishes; whilst
Queensland, nettled at being left out in the cold by the route
selected, intimated her strong opposition. Sir James Fergusson
having telegraphed to Mr. Strangways, giving his assent to the
venture being made, the latter caused a despatch to be forwarded to
the Governor of Ceylon, then the nearest available point connected
with Europe by cable, requesting him to send an advance telegram to
the Secretary for the Colonies, informing him that the Government
of South Australia had decided to recommend to Parliament the
construction of the transcontinental wire from Palmerston to
Adelaide. Shortly afterwards, one of the ministers having been
defeated at the general election, a reconstruction of the
Government became necessary, Mr. Strangways still remaining
Premier. When they met Parliament they recommended the construction
of the Central Australian line. A vote of want of confidence was
however at once carried on other grounds, and they resigned; but
the idea of the projected telegraph line had in the meantime
attracted so much support that Mr. Strangways was enabled to get
the needful bill passed through Parliament, and handed on his
plans, which were in the main adopted, to his successors. Mr.
Strangways, who was admitted a practitioner of the Supreme Court of
South Australia in 1860, and was a captain in the South Australian
volunteer force, and for several years Mayor of Glenelg, left the
colony in Feb. 1871, and has since permanently resided in England.
He married in 1861, Maria Cordelia, younger daughter of the late
Henry Rudolph Wigley, Stipendary Magistrate of South Australia, and
now resides on property at Shapwick, Somersetshire (of which county
he is J.P.), which was purchased of the Crown by an ancestor on the
dissolution of Glastonbury Abbey, and has remained in the family
ever since.</p>

he came to reside in Sydney, and took a prominent part in the work
of the Geographical Society of Australasia, of which he was

the death of the Rev. P. S. Menzies, one of the most popular of
Melbourne preachers, Mr. Strong was chosen to succeed to the
pastorate of the cathedral of Victorian Presbyterianism, the Scots
Church, Collins Street, Melbourne. Very soon after his arrival the
broadness of his religious views attracted the attention of the
ultra-orthodox members of the Melbourne Presbytery, but no direct
action was taken against him until he published an article on "The
Atonement" in the Victorian Review. This paper caused
considerable commotion in Presbyterian circles, and was made the
basis of the first of a series of formal charges of heresy against
Mr. Strong. The proceedings, originated in the Melbourne Presbytery
and prolonged through a variety of stages in the General Assembly
of the Church, lasted for several years, and were at length brought
to a close by Mr. Strong's charge being declared vacant by the

leaving he was presented with a testimonial of £3,000, subscribed
by all denominations in Melbourne as a token of sympathy and
presented to him at the Town Hall on Nov. 14th; but Mr. Strong soon
returned to the colony and established a new religious body under
the title of "The Australian Church," largely composed of his old
friends and adherents amongst the Scots Church congregation.</p>

<p><a name="A1325" id="A1325"></a><b>Strong</b>, Herbert Augustus,
M. A., LL.D., formerly Professor of Classics at Melbourne
University, son of Rev. Edmund Strong, of Exeter, was born in 1841,
and educated at Winchester College under Dr. Moberly. He obtained
the first place on the college roll by open competition, and
proceeded to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he matriculated
on Oct. 20th, 1860, and was exhibitioner in 1861-3. He was first
class in Moderations in 1862, proxime accessit for the
Gaisford Greek prize in 1863, B.A. in 1863, and M.A. in 1870.
Private affairs obliged him to leave Oxford before presenting
himself for final honours in "Greats." He was for six years
Assistant Professor of Humanity at Glasgow University, and for
thirteen years Professor of Classics at Melbourne University (M.A.
1874). The latter post he resigned in August 1884, and is now
Professor of Latin at Liverpool University College, which is one of
the three branches of the newly formed Victoria University. He has
published "Specimens of Translations of Virgil and Catullus"
(Maclehose, 1871); "Translations of the Mostellaria and
Captivi of Plautus," with introduction; "The Student's English
Grammar" (Melbourne), in conjunction with Dr. Pearson; "The
Student's Handbook to Classical Literature," and a "Translation of
Juvenal," in conjunction with Dr. Leeper (Macmillan); the
Clarendon Press edition of Juvenal, which is now being wholly
rewritten (notes by Professor Strong, introduction by Dr. Pearson);
translation and edition of Paul's great work, "Principles of
Language" (Sonnenschein, second edition); "Historical Outlines of
German Grammar," in conjunction with Dr. Meyer (Sonnenschein);
"History of Language," by Strong, Logeman, and Wheeler (Longmans,
1890). Prof. Strong is now engaged on an edition of Friedländer's
"Sittengeschichte." He has received the honorary degree of LL.D.
from Glasgow University, and that of Officier d'Instruction
Publique from the French Government. Since his return from
Melbourne he has done much to make the resources and advantages of
Australia known to Englishmen at home. With that object in view he
has taken as the theme of several series of university extension
lectures the British Empire, and particularly dwelt upon the
importance of the Australian colonies to the empire. He helped to
found the Self-Help Emigration Society in Liverpool, of which Lord
Derby is president, and has given yearly in the large Rotunda Hall
a public lecture to about two thousand working men upon the subject
of emigration. He has thus been the means of sending out some good
men with capital, and preventing many useless hands from leaving
England.</p>

de</b>, K.C.M.G., C.B., D.C.L., F.R.S. (better known as Count de
Strzelecki), the well-known scientist and explorer, was a native of
Poland, and travelled abroad in order to escape the Russian yoke.
On his way from China he called in at Sydney, where he was
introduced to the then Governor of New South Wales, Sir George
Gipps, who persuaded him to undertake the exploration of the
interior of Australia. He devoted years of research and a large sum
of money to the scientific examination of the geology, mineralogy,
flora and fauna of the great Darling range. In the course of an
expedition, undertaken in 1840, he explored Gippsland in Victoria,
previously discovered by McMillan, and after great hardships
penetrated through the bush to Melbourne. He gave its name to
Gippsland. He discovered gold-bearing quartz in the year 1839 in
the district of Wellington, 200 miles west of Sydney. The Count
subsequently published "A Physical Description of New South Wales
and Van Diemen's Land," but without mentioning his actual discovery
of gold in the Bathurst district, which he had promised the
Governor, Sir George Gipps, not to divulge for fear of rousing the
cupidity of the prisoners and labourers. He returned to Europe in
1846, and on his arrival in England was welcomed by the Colonial
Secretary. He was selected as one of the commissioners for the
distribution of the Irish famine relief fund in 1847-8, and
assisted in promoting the emigration of many impoverished families
to Australia. In consideration of his Irish services he was created
C.B. in 1849, and was made K.C.M.G. in 1869. In June 1853 he was
elected F.R.S., and was given the D.C.L. of the university of
Oxford. He died in Savile Row, London, on Oct. 6th 1877.</p>

educated at the Edinburgh Academy, and subsequently at the
University there. He was engaged in mercantile pursuits in Leith,
Glasgow and London, and afterwards went to India, whence he came to
Sydney in 1851, and entered the service of the Bank of New South
Wales as assistant secretary. In 1855 he resigned the latter post,
and went into partnership with the late Captain Towns in the firm
of Towns &amp; Co. In 1876 he was elected to the Assembly for East
Sydney, and was Colonial Treasurer in the Robertson Government from
February of that year till March 1877, when the Ministry resigned.
In Jan. 1883, on the defeat of
the Parkes-Robertson coalition, he accepted the task of
forming a cabinet, and was Premier and Colonial Secretary till Oct.
1885. It was during his absence through indisposition in the latter
year that his locum tenens, Mr. Dalley, on his own
responsibility, made the bold coup of offering to
despatch the Soudan contingent. Towards the end of the year
Mr. Stuart left for London, with the view of acting as Executive
Commissioner for New South Wales at the Colonial and Indian
Exhibition of 1886. Though greatly enfeebled by ill-health, he
discharged his duties with success till his death on June 6th in
the latter year. He had just previously been created K.C.M.G. Sir
Alexander Stuart's widow died on Sept. 16th, 1889.</p>

Kenmore, Perthshire. In 1837 he started a school at Leven,
Perthshire, and two years later entered at St. Andrews University.
Having supported Dr. Chalmers for the Lord Rectorship after the
disruption, he was expelled, with the majority of the students, for
refusing to submit to an admonition from the senators. A Royal
Commission shortly afterwards reinstated the extruded students, but
Dr. Stuart removed from St. Andrews to New College, Edinburgh,
where he was a theological student under Dr. Chalmers. In 1844 he
was appointed classical master, and subsequently principal, of a
private secondary school at Upton Park, Eton, and in July 1848 was
married at Slough, Windsor, to Miss Jessie Robertson. He commenced
studying for the ministry in London and completed his curriculum in
Edinburgh, being licensed by the Free Presbytery of Kelso to the
Presbyterian church of Falstone, North Northumberland, where he
remained for ten years. In Jan. 1860 Dr. Stuart arrived in Dunedin
to take up the position of minister of Knox Church, which he still
retains. He is also chairman of the boys and girls' high schools of
Otago, and Chancellor of the University of Otago.</p>

at Port Adelaide in May 1887. Having resigned the above posts, he
was appointed, in August 1889, Crown Solicitor and Public
Prosecutor, in succession to the late Charles Mann, Q.C.</p>

<p><a name="A1332" id="A1332"></a><b>Stuart, John M'Douall</b>, the
celebrated explorer, arrived in South Australia in 1839. In 1844 he
acquired bush experience by going with Captain Sturt's expedition
to the northern parts of the colony as draughtsman. In 1858-9 he
commenced a series of explorations in the far north, and discovered
a passage between Lake Eyre and Lake Torrens, finding a splendid
pastoral territory beyond the desert country which Mr. (afterwards
Governor) Eyre had failed to penetrate. In the meantime
the South Australian Government offered a reward of £2000 to the
first man who should traverse the Continent from south to north. In
1860 he resolved to attempt the feat, and accompanied by two men,
travelled to within 400 miles of Van Diemen's Gulf on the north
coast. Forced to return by the hostility of the natives, he planted
the British flag in the centre of the continent on April 22nd,
1860, on a hill which he named Central Mount Stuart. In Jan. 1861
Stuart again started with a party of twelve men, but was again
compelled by shortness of provisions to return without
accomplishing his object, though this time ho reached within 250
miles of the coast, to which, in the meantime, Burke and
Wills, who had started almost simultaneously, had penetrated
by a more easterly route. In 1862 Stuart again started with an
excellent party, equipped at the expense of the South Australian
Government, and succeeded in reaching Van Diemen's Gulf on July
24th, 1862. Though he had not strictly complied with the conditions
laid down as to priority, the Government paid him the £2000 bonus,
and gave him a lease of 1000 square miles of grazing land in the
interior free of rent for seven years. In consequence of Stuart's
discoveries, the Northern Territory was granted to South Australia
by the Home Government. His triumphal entry into Adelaide took
place on the very day on which Howitt's rescue party reached the
city with the remains of the explorers Burke and Wills en route for
Melbourne. Stuart, who contributed enormously to the pastoral
development of South Australia, and paved the way for the
construction of the overland telegraph line from Adelaide to Port
Darwin, was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Geographical
Society, who also presented him with a watch. Returning to England,
he died there on June 16th, 1869.</p>

<p><a name="A1333" id="A1333"></a><b>Sturt, Capt. Charles</b>, who
is justly regarded as the greatest of Australian explorers, entered
the army at an early age, and went with his regiment, the 39th, to
Sydney, where, in 1828, he was selected by Governor Darling to head
an expedition which he had determined to send out to further
explore the Macquarie river. Finding no trace of the inland sea
marked down on Oxley's (the previous explorer's) chart, the party,
which included Hamilton Hume as second in command, took a more
northerly course, and in Feb. 1829 discovered what they named the
Darling river, and subsequently also what is now known as the
Bogan. Still determined to penetrate the mystery of the inland sea,
Sturt decided to solve the problem by tracing the course of the
Murrumbidgee to its source. Accordingly, in 1829, he started on
that second expedition, which, Mr. Blair not inaptly says,
"commenced the history of the Australian colonies," being
accompanied on the occasion by Mr. (afterwards Sir) George Macleay.
They struck the river at Yass Plains, 200 miles from Sydney; but,
after following the bank for a week, it became impossible to
proceed farther with the heavily laden provision drays; so Sturt,
with six picked men, now betook himself to a whaleboat, and decided
to trust his fortunes to the current of the stream. The remainder
of the party were sent back to Sydney, Sturt carrying what he
deemed would be adequate rations on a hastily constructed raft,
which was towed by the whaleboat. On the 7th day of the voyage
Sturt and his companions suddenly shot out on to the waters of the
Murray, a stream not unworthy to be ranked with the great
watercourses of the old world, and which has fed the pastoral
fortunes of Australia. The party now committed themselves to the
more tranquil current of the Murray. and on the thirty-third day of
their historic voyage found themselves in the midst of a vast
inland sea, which was named Lake Alexandrina, in honour of the
Queen, then Princess Alexandrina Victoria. They were now compelled
by lack of provisions to commence their return voyage, which, owing
to the difficulty of rowing up stream, was one of great labour and
hardship. Ultimately, however, they reached their old
camping-ground, and were relieved from Sydney just as they had
divided their last morsel of food, and symptoms of insanity were
developing themselves amongst the subordinate members of the party.
As his discoveries had virtually created South Australia, it was
not unfitting that Sturt's fortunes should be allied with its
future; and in 1838 he took up his residence there, becoming in
April 1839 Surveyor-General, with a seat in the Executive and
Legislative Councils. In Oct. of the same year he exchanged this
post for that of Commissioner of Lands. which he held till 1843,
when he became Registrar-General until 1848, from winch time he was
Colonial Secretary till 1851. In the meantime the Government were
naturally anxious to provide for the expansion of their growing
settlement. They therefore resolved to avail themselves of Sturt's
admitted capabilities in the exploration of the interior of the new
colony towards the unknown north. In 1844 he started from Adelaide
with a well-equipped party, which included John McDouall
Stuart as draftsman, and Dr. Browne as surgeon. Leaving Lake
Torrens on their left, the party passed up the Murray and Darling,
and then struck directly northwards. But now water failed
them, and they were compelled to remain in inactivity for six
months in what they called the Rocky Glen depôt, where there was a
good pool of water. Whilst imprisoned here the heat of the summer
became insupportable, and they were compelled to excavate an
underground chamber, in which they took refuge during the day from
the intensity of a heat which drew every screw from their boxes,
caused the lead to drop out of their pencils, and their nails to
become brittle as glass. Fortunately their water supply held out,
and enabled them, when the winter rains fell, to push on through
the seemingly trackless desert of the interior. At length even they
could go no farther, and after innumerable hardships succeeded in
retracing their steps to the Murray, reaching Adelaide after an
absence of nineteen months, during which they had discovered
Cooper's Creek. Captain Sturt's eyesight had been greatly impaired
by his previous journeys, but the third rendered him almost totally
blind. He managed, however, to discharge the duties of Colonial
Secretary of South Australia for some time longer, but subsequently
returned to England, where he died at Cheltenham on June 16th,
1869. Pensioned by the South Australian Government, the Imperial
authorities tardily recognised after their manner triumphs in their
way as valuable to the Empire as those of Clive or Hastings, and
better than theirs, because blamelessly won. Whilst Captain Sturt
was on his deathbed, the K.C.M.G., the normal reward of a very
different class of service, was placed at his disposal, but he did
not live to assume this lagging honour. The Colonial Office
authorities, with an excess of grace remarkable in a body which has
so resolutely sat on the safety-valve of Imperial expansion,
procured the royal permission for his widow to have the same title
and precedence as though her husband had survived to receive the
title. Lady Sturt died on June 5th, 1887, aged eighty-five.</p>

<p><a name="A1334" id="A1334"></a><b>Sullivan, Barry</b>, the
well-known tragedian, whose name is inseparably connected with the
Australian stage, was born of Irish parents, in Birmingham in 1824,
and made his first appearance on the stage in Cork, in 1840. After
gaining a thorough mastery of the histrionic art in the English
provinces, as understood by the "old school" of "legitimate,"
actors Mr. Sullivan "starred" in the United States and Canada
(1857-60), and returning to England he sailed for Australia in May
1861. He remained chiefly at the old Theatre Royal, Melbourne, for
the next six years, and may be said to have put theatrical matters
on a democratic basis by instituting the "shilling pit." Barry
Sullivan's career as manager and "star" in Melbourne may be very
fairly compared with that of Mr. Irving in the same dual capacity
in London. He played in that city for over a thousand consecutive
nights with almost unvarying success, producing in a long line the
whole of the great acting Shakespearian dramas, as well as the
other recognised masterpieces of the British stage. His own acting
as Richard III., Hamlet, Macbeth, King John, Othello and Iago, was
greatly admired by Australian audiences, who were not without
standard of comparison, having previously been made familiar with
the performances of G. V. Brooke in the same rôles.
Nor was Mr. Sullivan suffered to enjoy his great popularity in
Melbourne without encountering personal rivalry. During his
lesseeship of the Theatre Royal, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kean appeared
at the Haymarket Theatre, Melbourne, and the two tragedians were
often "billed" to appear in the same characters on the same
evening. As well as succeeding in the great
tragic rôles referred to, Mr. Sullivan proved himself an
admirable representative of such parts as Charles Surface,
in School for Scandal, and he was also most effective in
modern melodrama. One secret of Mr. Sullivan's wonderful success in
the colonies was the excellence of his companies. The names of such
artistes as Mr. and Mrs. Robert Heir (neé Cathcart), Mr.
Vincent, and Miss Cleveland (now Mrs. Arthur Stirling), Mr. T. C.
Lambert, Mr. H. G. Rogers, Mr. H. R. Harwood, Mr. Richard Stewart,
Miss Rosa Dann, and numerous other "old favourites," were always to
be found in the "cast." Mr. Sullivan played also in Sydney and
other Australian cities, returning to England in 1866, when he
reappeared at Drury Lane Theatre. In 1868 he became lessee of the
Holborn Theatre. His management closed in 1870, and from this time
forward he travelled backwards and forwards through the United
States, Canada, and England. From 1875 to 1879 Mr. Sullivan
accepted various brief engagements in London. Among his later
performances of importance in the Metropolis were those of Richard
III. (Cibber's version of Shakespeare's play) at Drury Lane in
1876; Macbeth, at the same house, and Benedick, at the Haymarket
Theatre, on the occasion of Mr. Buckstone's benefit, in August
1879. He subsequently made many appearances in the Metropolis, but
latterly his health began to fail rapidly. While at home in West
Brighton in 1888, he was so near death's door that the last rites
of the Roman Catholic Church were administered to him. But medical
skill and the watchful care of his wife and daughters kept him
alive until May 3rd, 1891.</p>

<p><a name="A1335" id="A1335"></a><b>Summers, Charles</b>, whose
work as a sculptor will always be associated with early Australian
art, was born at Charlton, near Ilminster, July 27th, 1827. In
early life he worked with his father as a mason in various English
towns, and it was while so working at Weston-super-Mare that his
innate artistic talent was brought under the notice of the eminent
sculptor, Henry Weekes, R.A., who was then engaged on a monumental
figure in that place. Young Charles Summers was taken into Weekes'
studio, and began his art career; afterward he entered the studio
of Watson, and assisted in the monumental group of Lords Eldon and
Stowell, now at Oxford. He was admitted as student to the Royal
Academy in 1850, and obtained the silver medal for modelling from
the antique. In the following year he had the almost unique honour
of receiving on the same evening the first silver medal for the
best model from life, and the gold medal for the best piece of
historical sculpture. After exhibiting with s access at the
Academy, Charles Summers emigrated to Melbourne in 1853, and after
trying the diggings, opened a studio in Collins Street, and
followed his art with great success. His chief work was the
colossal bronze statue of the ill-fated
explorers Burke and Wills, which he not only
modelled but cast in bronze with his own hands. In 1866 he left
Melbourne for Rome, where he executed a number of works, some of
special Australian interest, such as the recumbent figure of Lady
Macleay in Godstone Church, Surrey, and a bust of Viscount
Canterbury. In 1876 Mr. Summers received a commission from Mr. (now
Sir William) Clarke, to execute statues of the Queen, Prince
Consort, and the Prince and Princess of Wales, for the Melbourne
Public Library. These were finished in 1878 and sent to Victoria,
whither the sculptor himself intended to follow, but was suddenly
seized with a fit, and died at Paris on Nov. 30th, 1878. He was
buried in his favourite city, Rome.</p>

Doc., youngest son of George Summers, of Charlton, Somersetshire,
and brother of the above, was born in 1843, and in early life
was a chorister in Wells Cathedral. After studying under such
eminent musicians as Dr. Gauntlett and Sir W. Sterndale Bennett,
Mr. Summers graduated Mus. Bac. at Oxford in 1863, and after
holding the post of organist at Weston-super-Mare and at Notting
Hill, London, he emigrated to Melbourne (1865), and for fourteen
years was choirmaster and organist at St. Peter's, Eastern Hill,
Melbourne, one of the oldest and leading Anglican churches in
Victoria. In 1876 he was appointed Government Inspector of Music
for State Schools; acts as Musical Examiner for the Tasmanian
Council of Education; also the Education Department of Victoria,
and assists Professor Ives (late of Glasgow) as examiner at the
University of Adelaide. In 1890 the degree of Mus. Doc. was
conferred on Mr. Summers by the Archbishop of Canterbury, as a
social mark of recognition of his anthems and other high-class
sacred music.</p>

<p><a name="A1337" id="A1337"></a><b>Supple, Gerald Henry</b>, poet

the editorship of Sir Charles Gavan Duffy. Four of them&mdash;"Sir
Morrogh's Ride," "The Raid of Fitzmaurice," "The Sally from
Salerno," and "Columbus"&mdash;are included in "The Ballads of Ireland"
collected by Edmund Hayes. "Columbus" is a very striking and
sonorous poem, resembling in many respects "The Dream of Dampier,"
which in after-years he contributed to the Melbourne Review,
and by which he is best known in the colonies. In Melbourne, to
which he emigrated about thirty years ago, Mr. Supple practised at
the Bar and contributed articles to the

with Ann Ruth, daughter of Major-General Burn. His lordship was
born in London in 1830, and educated at St. Paul's School and
Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. (Senior Optime)
in 1853, M.A. in 1856, and D.D. in 1866. He was ordained deacon in
1855 and consecrated priest in 1856. From 1855 to 1859 he was
curate of St. Dunstan's-in-the-West, London, and incumbent of All
Saints', Spitalfields, from the latter year till 1866, in August of
which year he was consecrated Bishop of Nelson, N.Z., in Canterbury
Cathedral. The Bishop married Amelia Damaris, daughter of Rev.
Thomas Harrison, of Barham, Kent. In 1889, when Bishop Harper,
of Christchurch, who was also Primate of New Zealand, retired,
Bishop Hadfield was elected to the primacy. As, however,
there was considerable doubt as to the proper constitution of the
electing body, the validity of the election was disputed, and
Bishop Suter was nominated by the dissentient party. In the end,
however, the claims of Bishop Hadfield were acknowledged. Bishop
Suter resigned the see of Nelson in 1891.</p>

<p><a name="A1339" id="A1339"></a><b>Sutherland, Alexander</b>,
M.A., was born at Glasgow in 1852 and was educated in Scotland till
1864, when his father's failing health compelled the family to
remove to Sydney. There at the age of fifteen he entered the
service of the Education Department as a pupil teacher. At the age
of nineteen he had by his own studies in the evening prepared for a
university course, and in 1871 he joined the Melbourne University.
Having obtained an honour degree he was mathematical master to the
Scotch College during two years. At the close of 1877 he purchased
the school known as Carlton College, of which he is still
proprietor. Along with his younger brother George (q.v.)
he published in 1879 a school history of Australia, which has
enjoyed much popularity in the colonies, having attained a sale of
about 80,000 copies. Subsequently he wrote by himself a "New
Geography" which has been fairly successful as a schoolbook, and
which  induced Dr. Geikie to ask the author to
contribute to Macmillan's new geographical series, of which he is
the editor. But  Mr. Sutherland's most important work
has been done in other departments. In  1888 he contributed to
a work called  "Victoria and its Metropolis," the most
elaborate history of Victoria which has yet been written. In 1889
he published a volume of verse under the title of "Thirty Short
Poems." But the bulk of his literary work has been contributed to
the Melbourne Review, the Australasian, the Argus,
and a number of magazines (generally of short lives) which have
striven to nourish on Australian soil. Mr. Sutherland has recently
edited Kendall's poems, and has contributed articles on Melbourne
and Victoria to the Encyclopædia Britannica. He was for eight
years secretary to the Royal Society of Victoria, and has occupied
a good deal of his time during the last twelve years in the
delivery of popular lectures on scientific and literary
subjects.</p>

brother of above, was born on Oct. 1st, 1855, at Glasgow;
arrived in Australia with his parents in 1864; was educated at the
Sydney Grammar School and at the Scotch College, Melbourne;
proceeded to the Melbourne University, where he gained scholarships
and other distinctions and graduated Master of Arts in 1879. After
some experience as a teacher he joined the staff of the South
Australian Register. Of late years he has turned his attention to
inventions, and has taken out patents for photographic processes
for making illustrations for daily newspapers, the system being now
in use in various parts of Australia. An invention for cheap
windmills and one for concentrating the precious metals in poor
ores have been the results of his more recent inventive activity.
He is author of "Tales of the Goldfields," "Australia; or, England
in the South," and of a "Descriptive Geography of Australia."

successful as a builder, he was elected an alderman of Sydney in
1857, and was mayor in 1861. His principal municipal work was
in connection with the sewerage of the metropolis. In 1860 he was
returned to the Legislative Assembly for Paddington, which included
the constituency of Redfern, which, when subdivided and constituted
a separate electorate, he represented down to the date of his

<p><a name="A1344" id="A1344"></a><b>Swainson, Hon. William</b>,
was born in Lancaster, and was called to the Bar at the Inner
Temple. In 1841 he was nominated by Lord John Russell
Attorney-General of New Zealand, previously to the introduction of
responsible government; and sailed for that colony in company with
Chief Justice Martin. During the voyage out the two devoted
themselves to preparing an "outline of a legal system adapted to
the condition of an infant colony," and within six months of Mr.
Swainson's arrival he passed many measures for the better
governance of the country, including ordinances to establish a
supreme court and county courts, for the constitution of juries,
for regulating the practice of petty sessions, for establishing
municipalities, for promoting religion, for regulating postage, for
registration of deeds concerning real property, for facilitating
the transfer of real property, to render certain
marriages valid, for regulating the sale of liquors, for
licensing auctioneers, for regulating harbours, and various other
enactments. Mr. Swainson occupied his difficult position from
August 1841 till 1856, and was also a member of the Executive
Council. In 1854 the first General Assembly was convened in New
Zealand, and Mr. Swainson became Speaker of the Legislative
Council, holding meanwhile the office of Attorney-General. But the
new Parliament demanded responsible government for itself, and in
May 1856 Mr. Swainson and his colleagues resigned, and the
Ministerial offices were henceforth controlled by the General
Assembly. Mr. Swainson continued, however, to be a member of the
Legislative Council, as also of the Executive Council. During his
life in New Zealand, he took a great interest in the establishment
of the Anglican Church there, and was associated with Bishop Selwyn
in his efforts to found a constitution for it. In 1855 he went to
England on leave, and devoted much time to the delivery of lectures
on the advantages of New Zealand as a field for colonisation. He
was a member of the Grey Ministry without portfolio from April to
July 1879. He died in 1884, having been Chancellor of the diocese
of Auckland from 1866. Mr. Swainson was the author of "Auckland,
the Capital of New Zealand"; "New Zealand and its Colonisation"
(1857); and "New Zealand and the War" (1862).</p>

<p><a name="A1345" id="A1345"></a><b>Swainson, William</b>, F.R.S.,
F.L.S., was born at Liverpool, England, in 1788, and early
displayed a taste for botanical and natural history researches.
Quitting a position in the Liverpool Custom House, he entered the
commissariat department of the Treasury, and in 1807 was stationed
in Sicily with the English army garrisoning that island. Here he
studied the local botany and zoology, and subsequently made
researches in Greece and Italy, returning to England at the peace.
He then retired on half -pay as Assistant Commissary-General, and
visited various then scarcely explored parts of South America,
where he formed a large collection of birds. Returning to England,
he was elected F.R.S., and undertook to edit the department of
natural history for Lardner's "Cabinet Cyclopædia," to
which he contributed a number of volumes on various subjects. In
1837 he emigrated to New Zealand, and was employed to make a survey
of the forests and trees of Van Diemen's Land and to report
thereon. Mr. Swainson died at the Hutt Valley, Wellington, N.Z., on
Dec. 6th, 1855.</p>

<p><a name="A1346" id="A1346"></a><b>Swan, Nathaniel Walter</b>, a
well-known Victorian writer, was born in 1843* at Monaghan,
Ireland, and was educated at Glasgow University. At an early age he
emigrated to Australia, attracted by the fascinations of
gold-digging life. He tried mining in various parts of Victoria,
and then speculated in fruit and fish in Melbourne, ultimately
going to Sandhurst, where he worked a "claim" with small success.
Disheartened, he decided to return to Melbourne, and on his way
thither on foot fell in with Henry Kingsley, with whom he spent the
last few days prior to the final departure of the latter for
England. Swan now took to journalism, and edited the Ararat and
Pleasant Creek Advertiser, ultimately conducting
the Pleasant Creek News at Stawell. In the meantime he
wrote a number of stories, several of which appeared in serial form
in the Sydney Mail, the Melbourne Australasian, and other
leading journals. One of his best-known tales is "Luke Myver's
Harvest," which won the £100 prize offered by the Sydney
Mail against seventy competitors, one of whom (the second on
the list) was "Ada Cambridge." In 1875 "Tales of Australian Life"
appeared in London, and in 1885 were published "A Couple of Cups
Ago" and other stories (Cameron, Lang &amp; Co., Melbourne). He
died on July 31st, 1884. [* 1834?]</p>

Glasgow University he was articled to a solicitor, and afterwards
admitted a member of the Faculty of Procurators of Glasgow. He
emigrated to Queensland in 1863, and took up Zamia station, on the
Dawson River, where he remained for seven years. Mr. Sword entered
the service of the Queensland Government as Recording Clerk and
Clerk of Petty Sessions at Blackall in 1870, and was appointed
Police Magistrate at Aramac in 1877, being transferred to
Charleville in a similar capacity in 1881. In Jan. 1885 he was

<p><a name="A1348" id="A1348"></a><b>Syme, David</b>, the
proprietor of the Melbourne Age, is the youngest son of George
Syme, a Scotch State school teacher, and was born at North Berwick
in 1827. He was intended for the ministry of the Presbyterian
Church, but, having imbibed Liberal views whilst studying at a
German university, abandoned the idea of pursuing an ecclesiastical
career. Joining the press as a reporter, he did minor journalistic
work until 1850, when, his health breaking down,he emigrated to
California, whence, after an experience of some eighteen months on
the gold fields, he proceeded to Victoria. He had been there about
a year when his brother, Ebenezer Syme, and himself purchased
the Age newspaper, which had been founded in 1854. The
prospects of the paper at this time were not encouraging; in fact,
it was believed to be moribund, and was not even the accredited
representative of Liberal opinions, for though the Argus, alarmed
by the Ballarat riots of Dec. 1854, was by this time veering round
to Conservatism, it still enjoyed a reputation for Liberalism,
which it had earned in the early days of the colony, when it was in
fierce opposition to every Government. On the death of his brother
in 1859 the sole management of the paper devolved on Mr. David
Syme, in whose hands it has remained till the present time (1892).
Under Mr. Syme's management the Age has been the pioneer
of Liberalism in Australia, for, curiously enough, that paper has
been more the organiser than the organ of Liberalism, and has
therefore led rather than followed public opinion in this
direction. It advocated the financial supremacy of the Lower House
of Parliament, the opening of the public lands for agricultural
settlement, the encouragement of native industries by means of
discriminating import duties, free, secular, and compulsory
education, and the hundred other measures which have now become
embodied in the statutes, not only of Victoria, but of Australia.
Whether owing to the promptitude with which it pronounces on the
questions of the day, the judgment which it displays in its views,
or the vigour of its advocacy, or all combined, one thing is
certain: that there is no newspaper in Australia at the present
moment that possesses such influence as the Age. Although
Melbourne has only about a twelfth part of the population of
London, the circulation of the Age is equal to that of
leading London dailies. Mr. Syme is a singularly effective writer
of English prose, and on a varied range of subjects. Outside the
columns of his own paper he has from time to time contributed
articles to the leading English reviews on social and economic
subjects. Mr. Syme's first independent work of any magnitude was
the "Outlines of an Industrial Science," published in 1870. Roughly
described, this book is a vindication of Protection; more closely
examined, it will be seen to be rather in the direction of State
Socialism; and it takes this wider scope because it rejects the
adequacy of a single motive for accumulation, and deals with
society from the statesman's point of view quite as much as from
the economist's. Mr. Syme shows that the English principle of
competition is habitually inadequate to produce the effects aimed
at, and is injurious to society. The system of selling the public
land by auction in Australia has led to the monopoly of a large
part of the State domains by a wealthy class at prices
unremunerative to the State. Free Trade allowed the native
industries of Victoria to be swamped by importations of cheap
though inferior goods, with the result that the British
manufacturer ultimately became master of the market and could sell
at his own price. Then again the effect on the workman has to be
considered. A fall in wages being the natural result of a fall in
profits, the competition that reduces profits is bound to reduce
wages. As, however, society "gives its sanction to appropriation,
and thereby renders industry possible," it is entitled to show "a
constant solicitude for the object appropriated." In other words,
there is an art of industry which follows nature, and is known as
industrial legislation. Is it good for the whole community to make
roads? Then the State should make them or sanction and promote
their being made. "Is it good for the whole community that the
population should be fully employed and
adequately renumerated? Then it may be necessary for the State
to promote by such means as it has in its power the growth of
manufactures." It will be seen that these views, however opposed to
the general drift of the English school of economists, are
strikingly supported in some particulars by the theories of Mr.
Cliffe Leslie, of Professor Sidgwick, and of Mr. Jevons. In
America, where Mr. Syme's book has been extensively circulated,
they challenge comparison chiefly with Mr. Carey. Distinctly less
popular than Mr. Carey in his treatment of a difficult subject
matter, Mr. Syme is also distinctly more nervous in style and
systematic in thought. Carey apologised for a Protectionist tariff
in a commercial community; Mr. Syme indicates the Australian
tendency to the organisation of labour in the interests of the
whole community. Mr. Syme's second book on "Representative
Government in England" is mainly an attack on government by party,
and develops the doctrine that members should be more immediately
responsible than they are to their constituencies, and Ministers to
Parliament. Mr. Syme regards the body politic as a living organism,
which is continually undergoing renewal, not as a piece of dead
mechanism that must be set going from time to time, and he would
therefore give the constituency the right of demanding its member's
resignation at any moment, would have Ministers nominated in
Parliament, and would let the Houses dismiss an offending Minister
without disturbing his colleagues. Parties would still subsist,
because such divisions as Liberal and Conservative are inherent in
human nature; but when the power to obstruct useful measures was
taken away, and Ministers stood or fell by their individual merits,
"we should get rid of the bitterness of party feeling, the
dishonesty of party tactics, and the evils inherent in the system
of party government." One of the most suggestive and original parts
of this book is the thesis that the stronger the Government under
our present system, the less real work does it do. Mr. Syme's last
book, "On the Modification of Organisms," is mainly a criticism of
the Darwinian theory, and as such has provoked warm opposition and
attracted great attention. To the general critic much of its
interest lies in the fact that it is a curious direction of Mr.
Syme's leading principle to an entirely new domain of thought.
Having rejected Free Trade, the mechanical competition of blind
forces like greed and want, as an adequate motive for the
development of human society; having condemned the competition of
selfish interests in the machinery of government, he proceeds in
this volume to combat the theory of natural selection, the
extermination of the unfit, the selection of the appropriate, as
sufficient to explain the origin of species, and contends that all
modifications of organisms originate in the cell, which is the
psychological as well as the physiological unit. Mr. Syme has a
great deal to say, which he says with effect, on all the leading
views of Darwinism. Altogether the book is a very suggestive one.
Mr. Syme is an evolutionist without being a Darwinian. Mr. Syme was
married in 1859 to Miss Annabella Johnson, of Melbourne, and has a
family of five sons and two daughters.</p>

<p><a name="A1349" id="A1349"></a><b>Syme, Ebenezer</b>, M.L.A.,
brother of above, was born at North Berwick, Scotland, in
1826; received his early education at the school of his native
parish, of which his father was master; and when about fourteen
years of age entered the University of St. Andrews, where he
obtained a bursary for excellence in Latin composition, and won the
marked approval of his professors for diligence and proficiency in
learning. From early youth he had strong theological tendencies,
and a corresponding inclination towards the clerical profession in
connection with the National church, or with one or other of the
Presbyterian churches. But in the course of preparing for the
realisation of his purpose he encountered a difficulty which
eventually proved insurmountable, and thus occasioned a divergence
from the regular clerical course. The difficulty was with the
creeds. He could accept neither the full-blown Calvinism of the
Westminster Confession, nor the new and more liberal doctrine known
as the Evangelical Union or Morrisonian system then coming to the
front. In fact, he could not accept any creed, if acceptance meant
a pledge of absolute conformity. To him, with his highly idealistic
way of looking at things, it seemed to be decidedly easier to
forego the advantages of a recognised clerical position, than to
surrender his liberty to think for himself, and to speak honestly
the thing he thought. He came, therefore, to the conclusion that
the best thing for him, in order to be independent of the churches
and their restrictive creeds and obligations, was simply to find
for himself a sphere of labour in which he could do the work of an
evangelist freely, without pledge and without pay. And so, for
several years he laboured, an evangelist at large, making tours in
various parts both of Scotland and England, and preaching as he had
opportunity in the towns and villages through which he passed. In
course of time, and possibly as experience of hardships and
privations cooled somewhat the ardour of his first enthusiasm, he
sought a more domesticated life, settling for a while at
Manchester, at Glasgow, Sunderland, and other places, ministering
to small congregations whose views were more or less akin to his
own. He varied his clerical duties, at this time, by lecturing on
popular subjects, and by taking part in public discussions on
important questions of the day. He began also to write for
magazines and reviews, for the Westminster amongst
others. This literary work brought him into notice, and being
invited by Mr. John Chapman, proprietor and editor of
the Westminster, to assist him in conducting that review, he
removed to London, and stepped into the place that had just been
vacated by Marian Evans, afterwards better known as George Eliot.
At this time he was on friendly terms with Mr. Joseph Cowen and the
late Horace Greeley. A new era in his life opened before him when
he heard of the gold discoveries in Australia, and of the
tremendous rush of population in consequence. Perceiving what a
fine field for literary work was to be found there, he resolved at
once to occupy it. He sailed for Melbourne in 1N52, and immediately
on his arrival joined the ranks of journalism. In conjunction with
his brother David, he purchased the Age newspaper, which
had been recently started. He had a hard struggle at first, and for
several years afterwards, for the Age was far from being
in a flourishing condition when it came into his hands; but
gradually, under the new and vigorous guidance, it made its way
till at length it  was recognised throughout the colony as the
leader of public opinion. In 1859 he offered himself to the
constituency of Avoca as a candidate for a seat in Parliament, and
was returned by a large majority. Entertaining advanced Liberal
views he, of course, took his place in the Assembly beside
Mr. J. M. Grant, Mr. M. Wilson Gray, Dr. Owens,
Mr. Richard Heales, and other like-minded reformers; and his
name will always be associated with theirs in the history of the
Parliamentary struggles which took place during the "fifties," when
questions of the most urgent importance for the welfare of the
rising colony&mdash;such as those relating to the opening of the land
for settlement, education, vote by ballot, and so forth&mdash;were first
introduced into the Parliamentary arena, and which have since, some
of them after many and most arduous conflicts, been carried into
law, to the immense advantage of the community. After a lingering
illness, he died on March 13th, 1860, aged 34 years. His son, Mr.
Joseph Cowen Syme, was for a number of years part proprietor and
manager of the Age.</p>

<p><a name="A1350" id="A1350"></a><b>Syme, George Alexander</b>, M.
A., brother of above, was born at the town of Montrose, but his
early days were passed at North Berwick, a small seaport on the
south shore of the Firth of Forth, to which his parents had removed
while he was yet an infant. He was born in 1821, and when 14 years
of age entered the University of Aberdeen, then King's College,
where, on passing through the usual curriculum, he took his degree
of M.A. In 1840 be entered St. Mary's Hall, St. Andrews, for the
study of theology, preparatory to admission as a minister in the
National Church. Meanwhile, the Disruption having taken place, he
joined the Free Church, and while still attending privately to his
preparatory studies,was much occupied in preaching in different
parts of the country. This was exceptional work for a student, but
was undertaken by special appointment, owing to the circumstance
that during the first two years of its existence the Free Church
had more congregations than could be provided for ministerially,
and the emergency had to be met by appointing the more
advanced students to supply vacant pulpits. After two years'
experience of this quasi-ministerial appointment he resigned, as he
had got, meanwhile, to entertain strong, unconquerable repugnance
to the Calvinism of the Confession of Faith, and deemed it
inconsistent with honour to remain in the Church on finding that he
could not pledge himself to conformity with its creed. On leaving
the Free Church Mr. Syme went to Kilmarnock to attend the
theological classes recently instituted by the Evangelical Union,
and then superintended by the Rev. James Morrison, foremost amongst
Scotch divines in promoting the liberation of Scotch theology from
the incubus of Calvinism. Eventually finding his way to England,
Mr. Syme settled at Nottingham in 1848, and continued to reside
there for the next fifteen or twenty years as pastor of one of the
numerous Baptist churches of the town. The church prospered under
his care, and the more readily as most of its adherents were
disposed to advance along with the expanding movement of modern
religious thought. He laboured with an energetic, and at the same
time with a cosmopolitan spirit, for social and political progress
both at home and abroad. He was a member of the Society of the
Friends of Italy; he carried on correspondence with Kossuth in the
interests of the struggling nationalities; and when the Refugees of
1848 fled for safety to England, he formed a society at Nottingham
for the purpose of finding employment for them during their exile.
In regard to social and political matters at home, he supported the
cause of temperance, the early-closing movement, shorter hours of
labour, co-operation, extension of the suffrage, and the extension
both of primary and of University education, and whatever movement
of a reformatory character he advocated on the platform he had the
courage to support in the pulpit. As many of the working men in
Nottingham were of the so-called secularist persuasion, and he was
desirous of getting a hearing amongst them, he was ever ready to
encounter their leaders in debate. In this way he more than once
met Mr. G. J. Holyoake, and the result of these debates was such
that in some autobiographic sketches recently contributed to an
English weekly journal Mr. Holyoake refers to his quondam opponent
as "a Congregational minister, with whom," he says, "I had debated
with instruction to myself, and for whom I conceived regard."
Health failing him, Mr. Syme sought change of scene and occupation
in Australia. He arrived in Melbourne in 1862, and shortly
afterwards joined the Age staff. Gaining Colonial and
journalistic experience he undertook the editorship of
the Leader, from which he retired in 1885.</p>

<p><a name="A1357" id="A1357"></a><b>Tawhiao</b>, the second Maori
king, son of Potatau (Te Whero Whero), the first New
Zealand king (q.v.), was originally ailed Matutaera. and was chosen
to succeed his father in June 1860. In Feb. 1875, after years of
hostility and estrangement, Tawhiao had an interview with Sir
Donald M'Lean, Minister of Native Affairs, who informed him that
the abandonment of the confiscated Waikato territory which he had
demanded was quite out of the question. Tawhiao suggested that the
Governor should meet him at Te Kuiti. Sir Donald M?Lean's
propositions were &mdash; (1) That Tawhiao should exercise his authority
over tribes within his district; (2) that he should choose his
Council of Chiefs to keep order and repress wrong; (3) that the New
Zealand Government should assist him; (4) that the Government
should build a house for him at Kawhia and grant to him certain
lands on the Waipa and Waikato rivers. After a considerable amount
of negotiation the conference broke up without any definite
agreement being arrived at. The Governor did not go to Te Kuiti;
and though several chiefs assembled, Tawhiao held aloof, as his
invitation was not responded to. In May 1878 he had a meeting with
Sir George Grey, who had become Premier of New Zealand, at
Hikurangi. Sir George told him the Government would give him five
hundred acres of land near the grave of his father, would restore
other lands to his people, would erect a house for him at Kawhia,
and consult him as to surveys and roads. Tawhiao neither accepted
nor rejected these proposals. On May 6th, 1879, Tawhiao, in company
with numerous chiefs, had another interview with Sir George Grey at
Kopua, where he utterly repudiated all compromise with Europeans.
"All foreign innovations," he concluded, "must be swept away. Then
there will be no evils." The discussion lasted several days, some
of the chiefs rejecting the Maori king's claims and expressing
their preference for the Queen and the Treaty of Waitangi. The
conference ended fruitlessly, and Sir George Grey wrote to Tawhiao
before leaving that he was not doing so in anger, but in sorrow,
"because you have not been wise enough to accept the benefits
offered to you, and because the hope which I have cherished for
years, that I might be the means of placing yourself and your
people in a condition of prosperity and peace, has been again
deferred." In 1881 Tawhiao, to the surprise of all New Zealand,
visited the confiscated territory in the Waikato, and was profuse
in his professions of friendship towards the settlers, surrendering
his guns and those of his party to the resident military officer of
the district in token of peace. In Jan. 1882 Tawhiao visited
Auckland, and was received with great cordiality by the colonial
authorities. At the various entertainments given in his honour, he
urged amity and just dealing and forgetfulness of past evils.. He
had a satisfactory interview with the Premier, Mr. (now Sir
John) Hall. In 1884 Tawhiao visited England, having previously
taken the pledge by Sir George Grey's desire. He arrived at
Plymouth on May 31st, his object being to enlist the influence of
the Queen in checking the aggressions of the New Zealand
Government. The Maori king was successful in obtaining an interview
with Lord Derby, then Colonial Secretary, who promised to forward a
memorial to the Queen; but the tone ultimately taken up was that,
New Zealand having been granted responsible government, the
Colonial Office could not interfere in a matter eminently of local
concern. Tawhiao and his attendant chiefs left England on their
return to the colony on August 22nd, 1884. The King was much
annoyed at not being received by the Queen personally, objecting to
seeing only her shadow, as he called Lord Derby. Throughout his
later career Tawhiao's attitude towards the New Zealand Government
was one of passive protest to their land policy. In 1892 Mr.
Cadman, the Native Minister in the Ballance Government,
induced him to abandon even this and accept a pension of £225 per
annum.</p>

to the earth produced much excitement. His views, though questioned
by local amateurs, were subsequently confirmed by astronomical
experts in the colonies and Europe. On the retirement of the Rev.

<p><a name="A1360a" id="A1360a"></a><b>Thakombau</b>, the first and
last King of Fiji, was originally only chief of Mbau, in that
island. He was born about 1817. In 1832 his father, Tanoa, was
driven from his chieftainship of Mbau, and most of his family
murdered. Thakombau was thought harmless on account of his youth,
and was allowed to live, but plotted revenge in secret. When his
time came he acted with great vigour, restoring his father after
about five years' exile and punishing the enemies of his family
with horrible barbarities. Up to this time he was known as
Thikinoru, the "Centipede," but he was thenceforth known as
Thakombau ("Evil to Mbau"). His father died in 1852, and in July of
the following year Thakombau was formally installed Vunivalu, or
War King, of Mbau. He was now involved in internal and external
troubles of a most trying character, on one occasion being only
saved by the intervention of the King of the Friendly Islands and
on another having to hand over 200,000 acres of land to the
Polynesian Company, to enable him to pay a fine of £9000 levied on
him by the Government of the United States as compensation for
losses incurred by American citizens. Cannibalism was rife in Fiji
till 1854, but at length on April 30th of that year the Wesleyan
missionaries induced Thakombau to embrace Christianity and to
proclaim the abolition of cannibalism. What his former ferocity had
been may be gathered from the fact that, after defeating his
father's enemies, he had one of the prisoners brought before him,
ordered his tongue to be cut out, and ate it before the victim's
face, "cracking jokes the while," as Mr.&nbsp;Julian
Thomas&nbsp;records in his "Cannibals and Convicts." In 1857
Thakombau abandoned polygamy and was married according to the
Wesleyan formula, he and his wife being publicly baptised on Jan.
11th, 1858, under the names of Ebenezer and Lydia. In 1859
Thakombau, as the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the
sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined
by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for
cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of
Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June
1871 certain Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with Thakombau
as king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected.
The Parliament and the Government before long drifted into mutual
hostility, and the Ministry latterly governed without the aid of
the Parliament. The question of annexing Fiji had in the meantime
been agitated both in Australia and England on many grounds, and in
August 1873 the Earl of Kimberley commissioned
Commodore&nbsp;Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station,
and Mr.&nbsp;E. L. Layard, her Majesty's consul in Fiji, to
investigate and report on the matter. These commissioners on March
21st, 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of
the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but
on certain terms which&nbsp;were not acceptable, and
Sir&nbsp;Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was
despatched to Fiji in Sept. 1874 to negotiate. This mission was
completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded
to her Majesty by Thakombau, Maafu, and the other principal chiefs,
in a deed of cession dated Oct. 10th, 1874. A charter was shortly
afterwards issued by her Majesty erecting the islands into a
separate colony and providing for their government. Thakombau, who
had been guaranteed a pension in return for transferring the
sovereignty, visited Sydney, N.S.W., at the end of 1874,
accompanied by his two sons. When the old chief returned to his
native land he was ill with the measles. The disease spread
rapidly, and during the six months it ravaged the islands 40,000
Fijians died of it. The natives, as Mr. Thomas narrates, naturally
regarded this fearful visitation as an indication that the gods
were displeased at the surrender of their country to foreigners.
Thakombau died on Feb. 1st, 1883. [This biography appeared in the

<p><a name="A1361" id="A1361"></a><b>Te Kooti, Rikirangi</b>, is a
Maori chief, whose rise into notoriety dates from the year 1865,
when the last ashes of the Hau Hau fanaticism were being trodden
out on the eastern shores of the North Island of New Zealand. A
certain Major Fraser in the November of that year was engaged in a
fight with Hau Haus at Waerengaahika, and among his troops
(composed in large part of friendly Maoris) was Te Kooti
(pronounced Te Kawti), whom, whether justly or unjustly has never
been rightly ascertained, he suspected of treachery and
communication with the enemy. It is certain that Te Kooti had a
relative in the opposing Hau Hau force, and it is agreed that he
was a quarrelsome dangerous man; but the question of his disloyalty
remains open still. At any rate he was arrested by Major Fraser,
and deported to the Chatham Islands, a small group about two
hundred miles east of Port Lyttelton. Here, as the desultory war
went on, other prisoners were confined, until the numbers were
considerable. Te Kooti was detained for two years, at the end of
which time the prisoners became restive, alleging that the
Government had promised them their liberty after that interval&mdash;an
allegation which, however, was denied. The discontent increased,
and at last culminated in the escape of the prisoners, who on July
4th, 1868, seized a vessel called the Rifleman, and under the
command of Te Kooti sailed for the North Island, and landed at
Whareongaonga, six miles below Poverty Bay. Besides women and
children, there were a hundred and sixty-three men, who had armed
themselves with rifles and ammunition from the Chathams. Against
these Captain Biggs proceeded with a small force of Europeans and
Maoris; but Te Kooti refused to surrender, and Biggs was forced to
retreat. The Government immediately despatched a force under
Colonel Whitmore to arrest the fugitives; and Te Kooti, leaving the
coast, made for the Maumaukai ridges, whence a small force which
opposed his passage was obliged to retreat. It was stated by Te
Kooti afterwards that, had the Government suffered him and his to
depart it peace to their homes, nothing would have happened, and
all would have been well; that he came with no warlike intentions,
but merely to regain his liberty, of which he had been unjustly
robbed. The Government, however, were of opinion that Te Kooti was
dangerous, especially as most, if not all of his men were Hau Haus,
and they were at the time engaged in a guerilla warfare with
Titokowaru, a Hau Hau chief. Colonel Whitmore therefore tracked the
fugitive through the ridges, where the heavy bush impeded progress,
and a path had to be cut with great difficulty, and at last came up
with him at Puketapu, where an indecisive engagement was fought. Te
Kooti was a thorough tactician, as his marvellous career showed
afterwards; and this was the first occasion the English had to
notice his power. Colonel Whitmore gave up the pursuit, and in a
month Te Kooti was a hundred miles inland among the fastnesses of
an unknown country. For a short time nothing more was heard of the
rebel, and the Government had its hands more than full with
Titokowaru; but on Nov. 10th Te Kooti issued from his mountain
retreat and came down upon the settlement of Poverty Bay,
massacring man, woman, and child. In all thirty-two whites
perished, and the tales of the massacre sent a thrill of horror
through the colony and gave rise to a wild cry for vengeance.
Immediately a body of volunteers was assembled, and was joined by
the friendly Ngatiporous and Ngatikahungunus; the former, who
formed the largest number of the avengers (for Maoris had perished
in even greater proportion than whites), were headed by the famous
Bopata (now Major Bopata), the bitterest foe the chief Hau Haus
ever had and a staunch friend to the colonists. Bopata forced the
Hau Haus to evacuate the Makaretu pa which they were occupying, and
they took refuge in Ngatapa, an unassailable natural fortress
surrounded by precipices. Here Ropata's men in. alarm deserted him,
and the Ngatikahungunus took umbrage and went home. Ropata,
however, and a Mr. Reece with sixteen men gallantly scaled the
precipices and effected a lodgment under the pa. Forced to
retire, Ropata retreated to his tribe for new troops, and, joining
Whitmore's forces, marched once more upon the citadel. Under
Ropata's guidance the pa was stormed, and taken amid terrible
slaughter; but Te Kooti, with the bulk of his men, escaped
westward. He soon reappeared, and from time to time swooped down
upon friendly pas, killing all who offered any resistance. At this
time he was in the wild recesses of the Uriwera mountains; and he
seems to have been stimulated by his security and successes to
assume considerable state and pose as a conqueror. Ropata was ever
on his trail; and Te Kooti was careful never to come into collision
with the dreaded Ngatiporou, but contented himself with occasional
raids. The object of the Government was to pen him up in the
eastern corner of the island, where he was isolated in great
measure or surrounded by tribes friendly to the whites; at all
costs they wished to keep him from passing westward into the
Waikato country, where he might stir up the King natives to a
renewal of the lately abandoned war and be himself safe from
pursuit. However, by a series of successful strategies, he
succeeded in eluding the combined forces and got through into the
King country. Here, however, he was disappointed; Tawhiao, the
King, refused to receive him, and the great chiefs gave him scant
countenance. Even the famous fighting chief Rewi abandoned him, and
he left the King country to enter once more on his cateran career
in the mountains, in the course of which he received occasional
checks from friendly natives and Europeans, but invariably managed
to elude capture. After some time of quiescence he suddenly made
his appearance in the Waikato near the settlement of Cambridge,
where he entered into negotiations with Mr. Firth to secure peace
and pardon. But Topia and the terrible Rangihiwinui were at his
heels; and the Government, confident of his capture, rejected his
overtures. Rangihiwinui and Colonel McDonell, with five hundred and
twenty Wanganuis and Arawas and a hundred Europeans, came up with
him north of Lake Taupo, in the heart of the island. His camp was
captured; but, as ever, he escaped mysteriously, to be found again
elsewhere and once again to vanish out of the ken of all men. His
object now was to reach the Uriwera country, for the Uriweras were
friendly to him, and in their wild mountains he might defy his foes
as he had defied them so often before. But the Arawas sturdily
refused to let him pass through their country; and he made a bold
descent upon the coast of the Bay of Plenty, where the Tauranga
settlers rose in desperate terror to defend their homes. But,
leaving Tauranga untouched, Te Kooti turned southward, and fled
before Rangihiwinui to Lake Rotorua, where he outmanoeuvred an
English officer who had been left to guard the passes, and broke
eastward through the dense bush towards Uriwera. Tired and
dispirited by the fruitless chase which had now lasted for eighteen
months, the pursuers held a consultation, and resolved to organise
a fresh expedition, of which the Maoris Ropata and Rangihiwinui
should bear the main brunt. A price of £5,000 was put on Te Kooti's
head, and the Ngatiporous rose in arms under the fierce Ropata,
combining with the Wanganuis and Ngatikahungunus to crush the bold
rebel in his lair. With a generalship which did him credit,
Rangihiwinui penetrated the Uriwera country and made a treaty with
the Uriweras, by whom Te Kooti found himself unsupported. Yet he
was not idle, but continued to make his occasional raids, even when
his following was reduced to two-score poorly fed Maoris, who lived
no one knew how. His career was now practically closed, yet he
could not be taken; and the hunt dragged on year by year, until
finally by a last effort this brilliant savage burst away from the
relentless troops of Ropata, and passed safely into the King
country, where Rewi had in time past stipulated for a sort of city
of refuge. Here this remarkable man lived quietly until men lost
sense of the heat of the past fray, and he received a pardon from
the New Zealand Government; and here he continued to remain till
1884, when he announced his intention of going down to the east
coast, in the direction of Poverty Bay. An outcry was the immediate
result, and Ropata especially urged upon the Government the
necessity of preventing Te Kooti from carrying out his design. The
settlers whose fathers and sons, wives and daughters, had
perished fifteen years before, vowed that Te Kooti should die
if he set foot on Hawke's Bay soil. The Government intervened, and
Te Kooti abandoned his scheme, to which, however, he recurred in
1889, when he was placed under temporary arrest.</p>

<p><a name="A1362" id="A1362"></a><b>Te Whiti</b>, a Maori prophet
who has gained considerable notoriety, first sprang into prominence
in the year 1870, when he commenced to hold a series of half-yearly
meetings at his settlement of Parihaka, to which discontented
natives from all parts of New Zealand flocked. At the end of the
West Coast war in Sept. 1865, the whole coast from Wanganui to the
White Cliff, forty miles north of New Plymouth, was confiscated,
but the natives were not driven from their territory, to a large
part of which they were ultimately restored. Three years later the
West Coast natives, under Titokowaru, again raised the standard of
rebellion, but, being defeated, took refuge in the forest country
behind Waitara. The West Coast country gradually became settled by
Europeans, and the object of Te Whiti's mission was to displace
these settlers and restore the lands to their original owners. Te
Whiti himself had never been in rebellion. He had indeed on various
occasions manifested his friendliness towards the Europeans, and he
now preached peaceful resistance. Under his direction the natives
commenced ploughing up the grass lands occupied by the settlers. Te
Whiti in his harangues predicted a speedy resurrection of the
natives and the driving of the Europeans into the sea. Various
efforts were made by the Government to settle the prevailing
discontent, and Sir William Fox and Sir Francis
Dillon Bell, who were appointed commissioners to investigate the
causes of disquiet, reported in favour of very large reserves. This
report was given effect to. The gatherings at Parihaka, however,
had by this time assumed the character of a fanatical religious
commotion, and it became necessary to disperse the natives who had
gathered there. For this purpose Mr. John Bryce, who was
Native Minister, assembled a large force of volunteers, and on Oct.
30th, 1881, an advance was made against the pa. The natives only
offered a passive resistance to the arrest of the prophet. The
chief Tohu and a murderer named Hiroki, who was sheltering in the
pa, were arrested. There was, however, no bloodshed. Te Whiti,
Tohu, and Titokowaru were tried, found guilty of assembling
unlawfully, and confined as State prisoners during the Governor's
pleasure. They were subsequently released, but, in consequence of
further assemblages at Parihaka, Te Whiti was again arrested. The
dispersal of the natives had shaken the belief of many of his
former followers in the powers of the prophet, and no serious
disturbance afterwards arose. Te Whiti still lives at Parihaka, but
European settlement has spread extensively over the fertile lands
that were in d is pate, and there is no danger of further Maori
disturbances in that district, or, indeed, in any part of New
Zealand. By some of the leading colonists, Te Whiti, now that all
dangers from his policy are past, is regarded as one of the most
genuine and sincere of moralists. His eloquence and his ethics,
both mainly based on New Testament models, embody a scorn of modern
civilisation and money-grubbing not at all in accord with the
tendencies of a material age or complimentary to the mundane
"spirit of colonisation."</p>

<p><a name="A1363" id="A1363"></a><b>Therry, Very Rev. John
Joseph</b>, Arch-Priest of Sydney, was born at Cork, in Ireland, in
1791, and entered Carlow College in his seventeenth year. He
studied for the priesthood under the famous Dr. Doyle, and was
ordained in 1815. He was appointed to a curacy in Cork, where he
happened to meet Father O'Flynn, who had gone out to Sydney in 1817
to afford the Catholics there the ministrations of their religion,
and who had been imprisoned and expelled from New South Wales by
order of Governor Macquarie. The matter was represented in the
House of Commons with the result that the Imperial Government
became responsible for sending out to Australia two salaried and
accredited priests, of whom Father Therry was one. They sailed from
Cork in Dec. 1819, and arrived in Sydney in May 1820. On presenting
their credentials they were coldly received by Governor Macquarie,
who warned them not to try to make converts, not to celebrate mass
publicly except on Sundays and the holy days of the Church of
England, and not to interfere with the religious instruction of
Catholic children in the orphan schools, all the inmates of
which must be instructed in the faith and doctrines of the Church
of England. Against this last prohibition Father Therry protested,
and was, on one occasion, suspended from his clerical office for
his pertinacity, and only reinstated after an appeal to the
Imperial authorities. Father Therry, who laid the foundation-stone
of St. Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, a year after his arrival, sent his
coadjutor to Van Diemen's Land, and attended singly to the
spiritual needs of the 10,000 Catholics of the colony for a period
of five years, when Father McEncroe arrived. He did an
excellent work amongst the convicts, and may be regarded as the
apostle of Catholicism in Australia. On the arrival of the late
Archbishop Ullathorne in Sydney in 1833, Father Therry
became his subordinate. Subsequently he was stationed in Tasmania.
Father Therry died at Balmain, Sydney, on May 25th, 1864.</p>

<p><a name="A1364" id="A1364"></a><b>Therry, Sir Roger</b>, Knt.,
was born in Ireland on April 22nd, 1800, and was admitted to the
Irish bar in 1824. He was appointed Commissioner of the Court of
Requests for New South Wales in Nov. 1829; a magistrate in April
1830, and Attorney-General of the colony in May 1841 as locum
tenens during the absence of Mr. Plunkett. In 1843, after
a sharp contest with Mr. (afterwards Sir) Charles Cowper, he
was returned for Camden to the old Legislative Council. He
subsequently acted as Crown Prosecutor. In Jan. 1845 he succeeded
the late Judge Jeffcott as Resident Judge at Port Phillip. In Feb.
1846 he was in turn succeeded by Mr. (afterwards Sir) William
à Becket, and was gazetted a Puisne Judge of the Supreme Court of
New South Wales, and primary Judge in Equity. In 1859 he retired
from the Bench, and went to live in England, where he died on May
17th, 1874, Lady Therry dying on the 27th of the same month. Whilst
resident in England, after quitting Australia, Sir Roger published
"Reminiscences of Thirty Years' Residence in New South Wales,"
which, containing as it did much curious data regarding private
families and persons, created considerable stir, and ultimately the
first edition was withdrawn from circulation and an expurgated
version issued (1863). Sir Roger Therry was a Roman Catholic, and
in his early career in New South Wales warmly vindicated the claims
of his co-religionists to the freedom of conscience and liberty of
worship which was for a long time denied them. In 1833 he defended
six assigned servants, who were charged with insubordination on the
estate of Major Mudie of the Hunter river. The men were convicted
and executed, but an official inquiry instigated by Mr. Therry
resulted in Major Mudie's name being removed from the commission of
the peace. Two years later Mr. Therry was a candidate for the
office of Chairman of Quarter Sessions, and was defeated by Mr.
Riddell as the result of the animus which he had aroused amongst
the magistrates by his action in the Castle-Forbes affair, as it
was called. Before he left Ireland for Australia, Sir Roger was
associated with O'Connell's Catholic emancipation agitation. He was
also acquainted with the great statesman George Canning, and after
the latter's death he edited the volumes of his speeches, which
were published in London in 1828. Two years prior to this he had
published "A Letter to the Right Hon. George Canning on the Present
State of the Catholic Question." Sir Roger was one of the first
members of the Senate of Sydney University.</p>

<p><a name="A1365" id="A1365"></a><b>Thierry, Charles, Baron
de</b>, who claimed the sovereignty of New Zealand prior to the
British annexation, was an Englishman, though born of French
parents. He bore a French title, and was by birth and education a
gentleman. In 1820 he had met with Hongi, a Maori chief, at
Cambridge, where the Baron was studying at the university. Hongi
was accompanied by a missionary named Kendall, who received from
the Baron thirty-six axes wherewith to buy land for him on his
return to New Zealand. In virtue of those axes, the Baron claimed
an estate of forty thousand acres, but, as a matter of fact,
Kendall only secured for him two hundred acres at Hokianga. In the
deed of conveyance, dated in 1822, he is "described as Baron
Charles Philip Hippolytus de Thierry, of Bathampton, in the county
of Somerset, England, and of Queens' College, Cambridge." The Baron
had held a minor diplomatic appointment, and had been in an English
regiment. He therefore applied to the British Government to
countenance him in the schemes of territorial aggrandisement in New
Zealand which had filled his mind since meeting Hongi. Earl
Bathurst's reply, given in 1823, was that New Zealand was "not a
possession of the Crown." Foiled in England, the Baron asserted his
French citizenship and applied for aid to the French Government.
Offended by his prior application to England, they in turn gave him
the cold shoulder. In 1826 he opened an office in London for the
reception of applications from would-be colonists. This move, too,
proved a failure, and he went to America with the, as it proved,
unavailing view of securing countenance in that quarter. In 1835 he
got as far as Tahiti, and proclaimed himself sovereign chief of New
Zealand and King of Nuhuhera, one of the Marquesas islands. As a
counterblast, Busby, the British resident in New Zealand, induced
some of the leading chiefs to declare their independence under the
name of the "United Tribes of New Zealand." He also appealed to all
British subjects to resist the Baron's pretensions. Thierry replied
denying British rights of interference, and put himself forward as
"the humble champion of the present and future liberties of New
Zealand." Of this declaration he sent a copy to Sir Richard
Bourke, the Governor of New South Wales. In 1837 he visited Sydney,
and offered to lay down his sovereign title, if Bourke would
guarantee him protection, professing to rely merely on moral
suasion for the advancement of his claims. Bourke, whilst declining
to recognise or protect him, took no active steps to suppress his
proceedings. Gathering together a motley crew of "subjects" in
Sydney, he at last landed at Hokianga in Nov. 1837. Here he was
equally derided by the white and Maori residents, the latter
calling him "King Pukanva," i.e., "a king unrecognised." The
Rev. James Buller wrote, "I was present at a conference he had with
the native chiefs at Otararau. They smiled at his demands. It ended
in the cession of about three hundred acres of good forest land to
him on the part of Tomati Waka and Taonui. They said they were
sorry they had not a good house to offer for the accommodation of
himself, the Baroness, and their retinue. He built some fragile
houses and began the making of a road, which was, he said, to be
extended to the Bay of Islands. But ere long the poor Baron was
deserted by all his followers. He afterwards took up his abode at
Auckland, where he obtained a scanty living as a teacher of music,
and died in great poverty in 1864, at the age of seventy-one.
Fantastic as his scheme was, his claims were recognised by the
French Government. Their ships of war that touched at Auckland had
orders to pay him great respect." When the French Roman Catholic
bishop, Pompallier, landed at Hokianga in 1838, he brought letters
of recommendation to the Baron from the French Government, and it
is certain that Thierry's claims and their quasi-recognition by the
French authorities had a good deal to do with hastening the British
annexation in 1840.</p>

on the conclusion of the Civil War, and was attached to papers
in New York and San Francisco. He was in France during the
Franco-German war, and afterwards visited South America, Tahiti,
and Hawaii. He went to Australia in 1874, and commenced the series
of "Vagabond" papers in the Melbourne Argus, which created a
remarkable sensation, and were subsequently republished in book
form. In 1877 he went to the newly discovered gold fields in
Northern Queensland, and in the following year proceeded to New
Caledonia as war correspondent during the native revolt. He was for
some months with the French troops attached to the expedition of
Henri Reviere, afterwards killed in Tonquin; and visited the
Isle of Pines, being the only journalist ever allowed to land
there. In 1879 he again travelled through Northern and Central
Queensland. On his return he went to the Fiji Islands, and spent
some months in that group; and in 1880 visited China, Japan, and
British Columbia, returning to Australia in 1882. In that and the
following year he spent a long time in the South Pacific, visiting
New Caledonia, the New Hebrides, the Solomon Islands, and New
Guinea, where he commanded the expedition sent out by
the Argus proprietary. The "Vagabond" was the first to
call attention in the press to French and German aggressions in the
South Seas. In 1886 he was special correspondent of the
Melbourne Argus at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition at
South Kensington. In 1887 he revisited New Caledonia and the New
Hebrides, on behalf of the Melbourne Age. He revisited England
in 1888, and in 1889 went to Tonga and Samoa for the Age, saw
the return of the deposed king Malietoa at the latter place, and
witnessed the troubles in Tonga. He is author of "Vagabond Papers"
(five series), "Occident and Orient," "Cannibals and Convicts", and
several plays, of which No Mercy is the best known. The
"Vagabond" claims to have travelled more extensively over Australia
and New Zealand than any living journalist. In 1891-2 he acted as
secretary to the Royal Commission on Charities appointed by the
Victorian Government.</p>

<p><a name="A1368" id="A1368"></a><b>Thomas, Margaret</b>, an
Australian sculptor and portrait painter, was born in Surrey, but
taken to Victoria by her parents when quite a child. Miss Thomas
received her first art education under the late Charles
Summers, the sculptor, who had then a studio in Melbourne. She was
one of the first three art students to apply for, and obtain
permission, to draw from the casts and copy the pictures in the
galleries of the Melbourne Public Library, and she exhibited both
sculpture and paintings at the Victorian Society of Fine Arts
Exhibition. Miss Thomas next proceeded to South Kensington, and
from there to Rome, where she remained as a student over two years
and a half. On returning to England, she was admitted a student of
the Royal Academy, and won the silver medal for sculpture, this
being the first occasion on which that distinction was bestowed on
a lady student. After two years' study, Miss Thomas set up a London
studio, and was a frequent exhibitor at the Academy&mdash;in 1874 having
no less than six portraits on the walls. On the death of Mr.
Charles Summers in 1878, it was decided to erect a memorial bust of
him in the Shire Hall, Taunton, and Miss Thomas, his old Melbourne
pupil, was chosen to execute the work, which was unveiled by the
High Sheriff of the County of Somerset on Nov. 26th, 1880. Miss
Thomas subsequently executed busts of a number of other
"Somersetshire worthies" for the Shire Hall, Taunton, including
that of Henry Fielding, unveiled by James Russell Lowell, then
American Minister; General Jacob, of the Scinde Horse, founder of
Jacobabad; and Dr. Wilson Fox, the Queen's physician. She recently
finished (1891) a marble bust of the late Richard Jefferies, for
Salisbury Cathedral. Miss Margaret Thomas is also an
industrious littérateur, and has published a memoir of Charles
Summers, entitled, "A Hero of the Workshop," and a quantity of
verse in various English, American and Australian periodicals, a
selection from which will be found in Mr. Douglas Sladen's
"Anthology."</p>

D.D., Bishop of Goulburn, N.S.W., was son of John Thomas, of
Aberffrwd, Cardiganshire, by the daughter of Edward Williams, of
Llwynyrhedydd, Cardiganshire, and was born at Typoeth in that
county in 1816. He was educated at Oswestry and Shrewsbury schools,
and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in
1840, M.A. in 1843, and was made D.D. in 1863. He was ordained
deacon in 1840, and priest in 1841, and commenced his
ecclesiastical career as a curate at Birmingham. In 1843 he was
appointed vicar of Tuddenham St. Martin, in Suffolk, and was
Secretary to the Colonial Church and Schools Society from the
latter year till 1863, when he was appointed the first Bishop of
Goulburn. Bishop Thomas married in 1843 the second daughter of
Thomas Hinton Hasluck, of Handsworth, near Birmingham. He died in
New South Wales on March 15th, 1892.</p>

<p><a name="A1370" id="A1370"></a><b>Thomas, Robert</b>, a native
of Wales, was born in 1781. Settling in London on coming of age, he
was in business in Fleet Street for a lengthened period. When the
colony of South Australia was about to be established he decided on
starting a newspaper there, in conjunction with Mr. George
Stevenson, who acted as editor. The first copy of the South
Australian Gazette and Colonial Register was printed in London
on June 18th, 1836, prior to the departure of the first Governor
and the first batch of emigrants. Mr. Thomas, with his wife and
family, arrived in the colony by the Africaine in Nov.
1836; his eldest son Robert having preceded him as one of Colonel
Light's Survey Staff in the Cygnet. The first number of
the Register published in the colony appeared on June
3rd, 1837. Mr. Thomas lived many years after the success of his
enterprising venture had surpassed his hopes. He had for some years
severed his connection with the proprietary when he died, on July
1st, 1860. [In regard to the Register newspaper, the
policy of the paper did not please the Government, whose
representative about 1840 deprived Mr. Robert Thomas and his
partner of the position and emoluments of Government printers. This
deposition was strongly protested against by the sufferers, and Mr.
Thomas visited England to take his grievance to Downing Street. He
failed, however, to obtain redress, and his firm sank under an
accumulation of embarrassments. Ultimately, however, the family
connection with the Register was renewed under brighter
auspices, and still continues. Supplement, page 541.]</p>

Adelaide, South Australia, on August 19th, 1851, educated at the
Adelaide Educational Institution, conducted by Mr. J. L. Young, and
married on Jan. 6th, 1876, Amelia, daughter of the late R. G.

<p><a name="A1372" id="A1372"></a><b>Thomas, William Kyffin</b>,
second son of Robert Thomas, was born in Fleet Street, London, in
1821, and emigrated to South Australia with his father in 1836, and
from that time until the day of his death Mr. Thomas was intimately
associated with the fortunes of the South Australian Register,
for the last twenty-five years of his life as one of the
proprietors. To his industry and ability in the different
capacities in which he acted was due to a large extent the high
character and phenomenal success of the Register, and the
weekly and afternoon journals issued from the same
office&mdash;the Adelaide Observer and Evening Journal.
The firm which now conducts these papers bears the name of the
subject of this notice, being known as W. K. Thomas &amp; Co., and
consists of of Mr. John Harvey Finlayson and Mr. Robert Kyffin
Thomas, the latter being the elder son of Mr. William Kyffin
Thomas, and grandson of the founder of the Register. Mr.
Thomas died on July 4th, 1878.</p>

Malbon</b>, is the son of John Thompson, sometime Deputy
Surveyor-General for New South Wales by his marriage with the
daughter of Charles Windeyer. He was born in Sydney on Dec. 24th,
1830, and educated at Cape's Grammar School. He was admitted an
attorney and solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in
1855, and removing to Queensland, where he was admitted to the Bar
in June 1880, practised at Ipswich, for which town he was returned
to the Assembly in 1868. Whilst representing this constituency he
was Chairman of Committees for two years, Secretary for Lands in
the Palmer Ministry from May 1870 to July 1873, and
Secretary for Public Works from the latter date till Jan. 1874,
when the Government retired. He was Minister of Justice in the
first McIlwraith Administration from Jan. to May 1879.
Mr. Thompson has resumed the practice of his profession as a
solicitor in Sydney. During his tenure of office as Minister of
Lands he carried the Homestead Areas Bill, and did a good deal to
stop the "dummying" of the State lands.</p>

Deas</b>, K.C.M.G., C.B., M.L.C., sometime Colonial Secretary of
New South Wales, second son of Sir John Deas Thomson, K.C.H.,
Accountant-General of the Navy, was born at Edinburgh on June 1st,
1800, and educated at the High School there, at Harrow, and at Caen
in Normandy. After assisting his father in introducing the system
of double entry into the accounts of the navy, and visiting
America in connection with his deceased mother's property there, he
returned to England in 1827, and was appointed clerk of the Council
of New Smith Wales, arriving in Sydney in Dec. 1828. Five years
later he married Anna Maria, second daughter of General
Sir Richard Bourke, K.C.B., then Governor of the colony, who
survived him and died on Feb. 3rd, 1884, aged seventy-seven. In
1837 he was appointed Colonial Secretary and Registrar of Records,
and a member of the Executive and Legislative Councils in
succession to Mr. Macleay, who had been removed from office by
his father-in-law. From 1843, when the Legislative Council became
partially elective, he represented the Government in that Chamber
until 1854, when he obtained leave of absence for two years on
account of ill-health. On May 20th, 1853, a select committee of the
Legislative Council was appointed to prepare a Constitution Bill;
and this having been passed shortly before his departure for
England, he was appointed conjointly with Mr. Wentworth to watch
its progress through the British Parliament. He was also appointed
one of the Commissioners for the colony at the Paris Exhibition of
1855. A service of plate was presented to him in appreciation of
his public services, and the sum of £1000, subscribed in excess,
was by him devoted to the establishment of a scholarship in the
University for the encouragement of physical science. In 1856 he
retired from the public service on a pension. At the election of
1856 he was asked to allow himself to be nominated for Sydney, but
the state of his health compelled him to decline. He represented
the Parker Government in the Upper House as Vice-President of the
Executive Council from 1856 to 1857. In 1861 he resigned his seat
in the Legislative Council in conjunction with Sir W. W. Burton and
eighteen other members, in order to thwart the attempt of the
Cowper Ministry to coerce that body by swamping it with twenty-one
new members. In the same year, however, he accepted a nomination to
the existing Legislative Council. Sir Edward, who was created
K.C.M.G. in 1878, was, in 1851, appointed a Fellow of the
Senate of the University of Sydney, Vice-Chancellor in 1862, and in
1865 Chancellor, a position which increasing age induced him to
resign in 1878. Sir Edward was one of the original committee which
reported in favour of the establishment of a University. He died in
Sydney on August 16th, 1879.</p>

School, and at the National Grammar School, Castlemaine. He served
his apprenticeship on the Argus newspaper, and
subsequently joined the staff of the Kyneton Observer, of
which he became editor, joining the Melbourne Daily
Telegraph in 1874. He married at Trinity Church, East
Melbourne, on June 1st, 1878, Alice, second daughter of the late
John Leyland, contractor, Liverpool. In the intervals of press
work, he acted as Secretary to the Parliamentary Boards on State
Schools, Safety Mining Cages, Wattle Bark, etc., and to the Royal
Commission on the Tariff. He was Secretary of Committees for the
Melbourne International Exhibition of 1880-81, and Secretary to the
Victorian Commissioners to the Calcutta and Colonial and Indian
Exhibitions, the success of the Victorian Court at the latter owing
much to his organising ability. He was a Commissioner for the
Melbourne Centennial Exhibition of 1888. He started the
Melbourne Evening Standard newspaper on April 29th, 1889,
and in 1890 founded the Sporting Standard, of both of which
papers he is general manager.</p>

abolition of the provinces. Of this measure he was a strong
opponent, and presided over the Convention which met at Dunedin to
protest against their extinction. He was at this time returned to
the New Zealand House of Representatives as member for Clutha,
defeating the late Mr. James McAndrew. For this constituency
he sat till 1887, when he was rejected in favour of Mr. T.
Mackenzie, the present member. At the general election in Dec. 1890
Mr. Thomson was elected for Bruce by a majority of more than
two to one over his opponent. He joined the Grey Ministry
in July 1877 as Minister of Lands, but retired on their defeat in
October 1879. In 1884 he was the mover of the resolution which
caused the resignation of the first Stout-Vogel Ministry,

pastoral pursuits, he was returned to the Queensland House of
Assembly for West Moreton in 1867, and sat for that constituency
till 1873, when it was subdivided, and he was elected for
Fassifern. He was appointed Postmaster-General in
the Macalister Ministry with a seat in the Legislative
Council as Representative of the Government in that Chamber in Jan.
1874, and in October of that year he attended the Intercolonial
Conference held at Sydney, to consider the laying of cables to
connect New Zealand with New South Wales, and extending the
communication to Singapore and Europe via Normanton. Mr. Macalister
resigned in June 1876, and Mr. Thorn became Premier with the office
of Minister of Works and Mines. In March 1877 the Ministry was
reconstructed, Mr. Douglas becoming Premier in place of Mr. Thorn,
who continued to hold office under his successor as head of the
Public Works and Mines Department till Nov. 1877, when he again
became Minister of Lands and Mines. In February of the following
year he resigned and visited England. On his return in 1879 he was

<p><a name="A1380" id="A1380"></a><b>Thurston, His Excellency Sir
John Bates</b>, K.C.M.G., F.L.S., F.R.G.S., Governor of Fiji, is
the eldest son of the late John Noel Thurston, of Bath,
Gloucestershire, and was born on Jan. 31st, 1836. In early life he
went to sea, and in 1866 was employed in the British Consulate of
Fiji and Tonga, becoming acting Consul in July 1869, the duties of
which position he discharged till Dec. 1869. At this time the state
of affairs in Fiji was of a highly anomalous character, the native
King, Thakambau, being driven to his wits' end by the
difficulty of controlling his own people and the motley band of
white settlers who flocked to the new Alsatia from all quarters of
the globe. In 1859 he offered the sovereignty of the island to the
Queen, but, on the advice of the Duke of Newcastle, the proposal
was rejected. The same fate befell the suggestion that England
should assume a temporary protectorate, and in 1864 a responsible
Ministry was formed under the King on the Anglo-Saxon model. A
Parliament was subsequently created, which came to loggerheads with
this Cabinet. The Ministry now fell to pieces, and on their
resignation Mr. Thurston was called to office by the united voices
of settlers and natives, becoming Chief Secretary and Minister for
Foreign Relations in May 1872. In March 1874 he was appointed
"chosen and special adviser" of the native King and chiefs, to
confer with her Majesty's Commissioners as to the annexation of the
islands to Great Britain; and upon the offer of cession became
Chief Secretary under the "ad interim Government." He was
again nominated as special adviser to the King and chiefs in Sept.
1874, for the purpose of conferring with Sir Hercules
Robinson as to the act of cession. When that was completed in
Oct. 1874, Mr. Thurston was appointed Colonial Secretary and
Auditor-General of the colony, and also Secretary to the High
Commissioner for the Western Pacific in Sept. 1879. He administered
the government of Fiji from Nov. 16th to Dec 20th, 1880, and in
1880 and 1881 was sent upon special duty connected with treaty
negotiations to the Friendly Islands. He was Deputy Governor of
Fiji in Oct. 1882, during the absence of the Governor on duty as
High Commissioner for the Western Pacific; and administered the
government from Nov. 1883 to July 1884. He was appointed Assistant
High Commissioner for the Western Pacific in Nov. 1883, and acted
as Consul-General for the Western Pacific from April to June 1884.
In March 1885 Mr. Thurston was summoned to England in connection
with the joint commission appointed to inquire into the claims of
German subjects to lands in Fiji; and in August of that year was
appointed British Commissioner on the Anglo-German Commission for
the discussion of the interests of German and British subjects
respectively in the South Seas, and for the more precise definition
of British and German territorial interests in those regions. He
again administered the government in 1885-6, and was made
Lieutenant-Governor in 1886. He held this position till the next
year, when he was appointed Governor of Fiji and High Commissioner
and Consul-General for the Western Pacific. In 1880 he was created
C.M.G., and K.C.M.G. in 1887. Sir John married on Jan. 14th, 1883,

educated at the Christian Brothers' School at Ennistryman and at
the Queen's University, Galway College. He went to Queensland in
August 1864. In 1866 he entered for the first Civil Service
competitive examination ever held in the colony. He soon
relinquished Government employment, and was admitted a solicitor in
Dec. 1873. He is Lieut.-Colonel commanding Volunteer Force,
Southern Military Division, and was one of the promoters of the
Irish volunteer corps. He was called to the Legislative Council in
July 1882. Mr. Thynne was appointed Minister of Justice under
the McIlwraith Administration on June 13th, 1888, and
represented the Government in the Legislative Council. On
Mr. Morehead becoming Premier, on Nov. 30th of the same
year, Mr. Thynne retained his post, but resigned with his
colleagues in August 1890. He was one of the Queensland delegates
to the Sydney Federation Convention in 1891. Mr. Thynne, who has
twice won the Queen's Prize at Queensland Rifle Association
meetings, and on several occasions was Captain of Queensland Rifle
teams in intercolonial competitions, was married at Brisbane in

1848 he was appointed assistant astronomer at Cambridge
Observatory, and in 1854 he took charge of the Galvanic
Department of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, where he was also
appointed one of the astronomers by the Lords of the Admiralty. In
1855 the Colonial Office nominated him for the position of
Astronomer and Superintendent of Telegraphs, for South Australia.
In 1870, on the amalgamation of the Postal and Telegraph
Department, Mr. Todd was appointed Postmaster-General. Although
when the project was first mooted Mr. Todd was somewhat dubious as
to the desirability of constructing the overland telegraph line,
his energy and resource in the superintendence of the undertaking
contributed much to its success and to the despatch with which it
was achieved. He therefore well deserved the honour of C.M.G.,
which was conferred upon him when the cable connection between the
Australian colonies and the rest of the world was completed, on
August 22nd, 1872. He afterwards laid out the overland line to
Eucla, a thousand miles in length, connecting South and Western
Australia. Mr. Todd, who is a Fellow of the Royal Society of London
and also of the Royal Astronomical Society and the British
Meteorological Society, married, in 1855, Alice Gillam, daughter of
E. Bell, of Cambridge. In 1886 the Universities of Cambridge and
Adelaide conferred on him the degree of M. A., and he is a member
of the Council of the latter university.</p>

(1749-1836), for 60 years editor and proprietor of the York
Chronicle, and uncle of William Blanchard (1769-1835), the
well-known comedian of the Covent Garden Theatre. In 1858 the
family left England for Melbourne, and the subject of this notice
completed his education at the Church of England Grammar School,
which was just then opened with the late Dr. Bromby as Headmaster.
Afterwards going into business, he took an active part in
establishing the Melbourne Review, of which the first number
appeared in January 1876, and for six years was one of the
editorial committee. He contributed to this periodical a number of
articles, chiefly on political and historical questions. Two of
them, "English Institutions and the Irish Race," and "A few more
words on the Irish Question," appeared separately in pamphlet form
and attracted a good deal of attention. In 1878, in conjunction
with Mr. A. P. Martin (q.v.), he initiated a movement
"for the purpose of expressing public appreciation of the services
of the Bar of Beaconsfield in the settlement of the Eastern
Question." A public meeting was held in the Melbourne Town Hall on
July 29th, 1878, at which a resolution to the above effect was
carried with enthusiasm, and speeches were delivered by several
prominent public men, including the late Mr. J. G. Francis and
Mr. James Service. An illuminated address also was sent to
Lord Beaconsfield. In 1880 Mr. Topp joined the literary staff of
the Age newspaper, and in 1882 that of the Argus,
with which journal he has ever since been connected. He has
contributed extensively to the columns of this paper and to
the Australasian.</p>

Dublin, where he graduated B.A. in  1864, M.A. in 1867, and
Mus. Bac. and Mus. Doc. in 1879. He was ordained by the Bishop of
Lichfield in 1865 for the curacy of St. Mary's, Shrewsbury, and
remained there till 1867, when he became curate of St. Ann's,
Dublin. He went to Victoria in Dec.; 1869, and in the following
February accepted the curacy of Christ Church, South Yarra, being
from 1871 to 1876 in charge of St. John's, Melbourne. He was
appointed acting head of Trinity College (affiliated to the
Melbourne University) on the opening of that institution in 1872,
but resigned on his nomination to the incumbency of All Saints',
Geelong, in 1877. In January of the next year he was appointed to
his present incumbency, at Holy Trinity, Balaclava. In 1879 the
degrees of Mus. Bac. and Mus. Doc. were conferred on him by the
University of Dublin, and he was subsequently admitted Mus.
Doc. ad eundem by the University of Melbourne. At the
Social Science Congress, in 1880, Dr. Torrance was elected
President of the Fine Arts section, and delivered the opening
address. In addition to his ministerial work he has given much time
and attention to the study and practice of music, which he began as
a chorister in Christ Church, Dublin, afterwards pursuing his
studies in Germany. Among other works, he produced in 1882 a new
oratorio entitled the "Revelation," which was performed at the
Melbourne Town Hall, under his direction. In 1883 Dr. Torrance was
appointed one of the examiners for the Clarke scholarship at the
Royal College of Music, London, and by the Commissioners of the
Centennial Exhibition of 1880 one of the judges in the competition
for the opening cantata. In 1886 he visited Europe, and was
present, with his protégé, Ernest Hutcheson, a rising young
Australian musician, at the famous "Wagner Festival" at Bayreuth.
He returned to Victoria in the following year. Dr. Torrance was
married, in 1872, to the eldest surviving daughter of the late S.

<p><a name="A1389" id="A1389"></a><b>Torrens, Hon. Sir Robert
Richard</b>, K.C.M.G., M.A., the author of the "Torrens Act," was
the son of Colonel Robert Torrens, who distinguished himself in the
Walcheren expedition, became a member of the House of Commons, and
was one of the founders of South Australia, by his marriage with
Charity, daughter of Richard Chute, of Roxburgh, co. Kerry. He was
born at Cork in 1814, and educated at Trinity College, Dublin,
where he took his M.A. degree. In 1839 he married Barbara, daughter
of Alexander Park, of Selkirk, N.B., and widow of Augustus George
Anson, of the 11th Dragoon Guards. He was appointed Collector of
Customs in South Australia, with a seat in the mixed Legislative
Council in 1851, becoming Registrar-General in the next, year, and
Colonial Treasurer in Oct. 1856. This office he held after
responsible government was introduced until August 1857, and was
subsequently Premier and Treasurer of South Australia from the 1st
to 30th of Sept. in the same year. Having been returned to the
first Legislative Assembly of that colony as member for the
metropolitan constituency, he at once set to work to place on the
statute book the great measure with which his name is indissolubly
associated, and which has conferred an enormous boon on the whole
Australasian community. His shipping experience had suggested to
him the query why land, the great object of acquirement in a new
community, should not be made as easily and cheaply transferable as
a ship, title by registration being substituted for title by deed.
The measure on its introduction was fiercely attacked by the
lawyers, whose vested interests were assailed; but it passed both
Houses, and received the assent of the Governor on Jan. 27th, 1858.
Fearful lest ignorance or prejudice should warp its administration
and thus strangle it in its infancy, Colonel Torrens resigned his
seat in parliament to undertake the headship of the department
charged with carrying out the Act. By June 1858, when it came into
force, all the necessary machinery was ready; and though it had
once or twice to be amended in points of detail, it worked from the
first, thanks to Colonel Torrens' foresight and energy, without any
serious hitch. Having perfected the system in South Australia,
Colonel Torrens visited the neighbouring colonies by request to
expound it to them; and it has since been adopted throughout the
Australasian group, where thousands of small landholders have
reason to bless the name of Torrens, without whose disinterested
labours they would in many cases never have secured their holdings.
Colonel Torrens left South Australia and returned to reside in
England in 1863, and was created K.C.M.G. in 1872, in special
acknowledgment of his services in cheapening land titles. He
unsuccessfully contested Cambridge in 1865, but sat in the House of
Commons for the borough from 1868 to 1874. Sir Robert Torrens, who
died on August 31st, 1884, was the author of "First Effects of Gold
Discovery on the Currency in the Australian Colonies,"
"Transportation Condemned as a Deterrent Punishment and as a Means
of Founding Colonies," and "Anomalies in the Present Relations
between the Mother Country and her Colonies." He received the
thanks of most of the Australasian parliaments for his labours in
developing his system of land transfer.</p>

failed. In 1886 he went to Adelaide to investigate the great strike
in his trade in that city; and drew up a scale of prices which
proved satisfactory to manufacturers and workmen alike. He also
established a Board of Conciliation, composed of equal numbers of
employers and employés, which Board is still an Adelaide

the Times, was born at Brixton, London, on Nov. 26th, 1833,
educated in France and afterwards at London University School and
at King's College School, London. In 1854 he became tutor to the
sons of Mr. J. Walter, M.P., proprietor of the Times. In 1861
he was admitted to the Bar at the Inner Temple, and was attached to
the staff of the Times for about four years. In Feb. 1868
he arrived in Adelaide, and joined as a partner the firm of Carter,
Tyas, &amp; Co., Manchester warehousemen. In 1872 he visited the
Aroo Islands, the coasts of New Guinea, and the Northern Territory,
on a pearl-shelling expedition. Mr. Tyas returned to England in

Adelaide.</p>

<p><a name="A1411" id="A1411"></a><b>Tyrrell, Right Rev.
William</b>, D.D., first Bishop of Newcastle, New South Wales, was
the son of Timothy Tyrrell, Remembrancer of the City of London, by
his marriage with Elizabeth, only daughter of John Dollond, the
famous optician. He was educated at the Charterhouse, and at
St. John's College, Cambridge, where he gained a scholarship and
graduated fourth Senior Optime. Having been ordained in 1832, he
held incumbencies at Aylestone, Leicestershire, and Beaulieu,
Hampshire. In 1847 it was decided to divide the unwieldy diocese of
Australia, and of the new see of Newcastle then created Dr. Tyrrell
was appointed first bishop. Whilst proving himself an exemplary
missionary prelate, Dr. Tyrrell embarked largely in pastoral
pursuits, and with such success that he was enabled to leave the
noble legacy of £250,000 to be expended on the endowment of his
diocese on a plan which he had drawn up and partially carried into
effect prior to his decease. The scheme apportioned, in addition to
provision for the working clergy, £10,000 for superannuation and
sick funds, £26,000 for the training of future clergy, and £44,000
for the religious education of the young. In 1876 the bishop had a
paralytic stroke, and died at Newcastle on March 24th, 1879, of
hernia, brought on by the long and rapid journeys which he had
undertaken in his early episcopal career.</p>

<p><a name="A1412" id="A1412"></a><b>Tyson, James</b>, is the son
of the late William Tyson, who came of a respectable Cumberland
stock, but having offended his family by a marriage of which they
disapproved, was driven into enlisting in the army. His discharge
was purchased about 1818, and he went out to Sydney with Mr.
Commissioner Bigge, who had been entrusted with the task of
inquiring into certain allegations made against Governor Macquarie.
He remained in Mr. Bigge's service for some time, and then took a
farm at Cowpasture, where he acted as district constable. Here his
son James was born on April 11th, 1823. Starting in life as a
working overseer, at a salary of £30 per annum, he joined his
brother William in a run at the junction of the Lachlan and
Murrumbidgee rivers, which they took up in 1846. In 1851, when gold
was discovered in Victoria, James Tyson commenced cattle droving to
Sandhurst, and opened a wholesale and retail butchering business at
Sandhurst, which he carried on with great success till 1855, when
he purchased a number of stations in New South Wales as well as the
famous Heyfield estate in Gippsland, Victoria. The former included
immense tracts of country on the Darling Downs and the Warrego
River, in what is now Queensland; and such was the wealth which he
acquired by his pastoral ventures that he was able many years ago
to offer the Government of Queensland a loan of half a million
towards the construction of a proposed transcontinental railway.
Mr. Tyson, who is regarded as the richest man in Australia, has
been a liberal subscriber to local objects, and a great friend and
protector of the aborignals on his various stations. He
has refused all parliamentary honours and distinctions. He is a
bachelor, most economical in his personal expenditure, and a total
abstainer from wine, spirits and tobacco. In 1892, in a time of
great financial strain for the colony, he took up £250,000 of
Treasury bills in order to assist the Government.</p>

<p><a name="A1414" id="A1414"></a><b>Ullathorne, The Most Rev.
William Bernard</b>, D.D., O.S.B., first Vicar-General of
Australia, was born at Pocklington, Yorkshire, on May 7th, 1806.
His father was a grocer, draper, and spirit merchant in the town,
supplying it with coal and discounting bills for its inhabitants in
the absence of a bank. The family history is somewhat curious. The
Archbishop's great-grandfather was a gentleman of property in the
West Riding of the county of York, having acquired an estate
through his marriage with Miss Binks, one of the lineal descendants
of the great Sir Thomas More and a connection of the
Waterton family. The property was forfeited through Mr. Ullathorne
being mixed up in the 1745 rebellion, the Archbishop's
grandfather and his brother being placed in charge of Dr. Lawrence,
of York. At his residence they were frightened by discovering a
skeleton in their bedroom cupboard, and ran away, the former
becoming apprentice to a shoemaker, and the latter a chemist in
London. The Archbishop's mother was a native of Spilsby,in
Lincolnshire, of which county her father was Chief Constable. Mrs.
Ullathorne was also a cousin of Sir John Franklin, the Arctic
explorer and Governor of Tasmania. His parents were both engaged
prior to their marriage at Townsend's great drapery establishment
in Holborn, London. Mr. Ullathorne having converted his future wife
to the Catholic faith, married her, and they then started in
business on their own account at Pocklington. The Archbishop was
educated at Protestant schools at Burnby and Scarborough, to which
town his father removed in 1815. When twelve years of age he was
employed in his father's business for twelve months, and then went
to sea on the brig Leghorn, of Scarborough. After being
several years a sailor he went back to his father's business, but
in Feb. 1823 was sent to be educated at the Benedictine Priory at
Downside, Bath. Here Father Polding, afterwards Archbishop of
Sydney, was prefect and director. After completing his course at
Downside, Dr. Ullathorne was for a time an assistant master at
Ampleforth College, in Yorkshire, and in Sept. 1831 was ordained a
priest of the Roman Catholic Church. He then returned to Downside,
where he found that Dr. Polding had just been offered the
appointment of Visitor-Apostolic to the Mauritius, with
jurisdiction over Australia. Dr. Polding, however, declined the
preferment, but subsequently recommended Father Ullathorne to Dr.
Morris, who now undertook the duties. After much hesitancy Father
Ullathorne decided to accept Dr. Morris's proposal that he should
go out to Australia as a missionary priest. Having got together a
good library, he was all ready to start, when a despatch was
received at the Colonial Office from Sir Richard Bourke, then
Governor of New South Wales, urging the desirability of a Roman
Catholic ecclesiastic being sent out to Sydney invested with
greater authority to transact the affairs of the Church in regard
to the acquirement of land, etc., than was possessed by the then
senior priest (Father Therry), with whom disputes had arisen.
The Church authorities having been applied to in respect to this
suggestion, Father Ullathorne was appointed Vicar-General for
Australia, Van Diemen's Land being alone excepted from his
jurisdiction, whilst the Government gave him the title of "His
Majesty's Catholic Chaplain in New South Wales," with a stipend of
£200 a year and an allowance for voyage, outfit, and travelling
expenses when on duty. In this more dignified capacity, Dr.
Ullathorne sailed for Sydney in the Sir Thomas Munro on
Sept. 16th, 1832, arriving in the New South Wales capital in Feb.
of the next year. Here he found a divided state of affairs, but he
very soon enforced unity by the exercise of his ecclesiastical
authority. Father Therry and two others were the only priests in
the colony at the time of his arrival. He was very cordially
assisted by the Governor of the colony, Sir R. Bourke, who in Sept.
1833 sent a despatch to the Home Government making recommendations
for the sustentation of the Anglican, Catholic, and Presbyterian
Churches and clergy in Australia, which were ultimately adopted
(1836). Dr. Ullathorne also wrote to the Colonial Office asking for
four more chaplains, and to the Roman Catholic authorities in
England urging them to appoint an independent bishop for Australia.
In pursuance of this, in May 1834 Dr. Polding (Archbishop
Ullathorne's old Novice Master) was appointed first Bishop of
Sydney by Pope Gregory XVI., and brought out with him three other
priests, whose outfit and passages were paid for by the Imperial
Government. Lord Stanley, in his letter informing the Governor of
the appointment of Dr. Polding, expressed regret, at Vicar-General
Ullathorne's supersession and offered him a similar position in Van
Diemen's Land, if he wished to quit Sydney. But the latter
preferred to remain in New South Wales, and loyally prepared the
way for Dr. Polding, who arrived on Sept. 13th, 1835, and who was
greatly assisted by Dr. Ullathorne in the organisation of the
diocese. In the meantime the latter had visited Norfolk Island,
with the view of preparing for death a large number
of convicts who had been sentenced for complicity in an
attempt to overpower the troops and warders and to capture the
island. As proof of the terrible condition of the convicts in
Norfolk Island at this period, it may be stated that when Dr.
Ullathorne announced to the prisoners which of them were to be
reprieved and which executed the former burst into tears, whilst
the latter fell on their knees and thanked God, preferring death to
the miseries of confinement on the island. Bishop Polding now
decided to send Dr. Ullathorne to England and Ireland to beat up
recruits for the Australian Mission and to obtain additional funds.
He accordingly left Sydney on May 10th, 1836, and after assisting
the Bishop in reorganising the affairs of the Church in Van
Diemen's Land en route, sailed from Hobart Town for England,
where he arrived after a six months' voyage, during which he
commenced writing a brochure on the convict system. During his
visit he was summoned to Rome to report to the Pope on the
Australian Mission and also took a potential part in exposing "The
Horrors of Transportation," giving this title to a pamphlet which
he published at the request of Mr. Drummond, Secretary to the
Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. In 1839 he gave evidence before Sir
William Molesworth's parliamentary committee on transportation,
which materially influenced the decision to discontinue the system.
Whilst in England he also published a pamphlet entitled "The
Australian Mission," which attracted a great deal of attention
amongst his co-religionists, and much facilitated the objects of
his journey, in connection with which he paid a long visit to
Ireland and delivered a course of lectures in the churches of
Lancashire. In the latter he also referred to the condition of the
convicts in New South Wales and Norfolk Island, which excited much
sympathy. He was successful in collecting a large sum; and having
sent forward two detachments of missionary priests to Sydney, he
himself set sail on his return to New South Wales in the Sir
Francis Spaight in July 1838, with five sisters of charity,
several school teachers, and three additional priests. Amongst the
clergy whom he had engaged for the mission were three who were
afterwards to become prelates of their Church in Australia&mdash;viz.,
the Rev. Francis Murphy, afterwards first Bishop of Adelaide;
the Rev. F. Geoghegan, who became second bishop of that
diocese; and the Rev. J. A. Goold, O.G.A., first Bishop and
subsequently Archbishop of Melbourne. Dr. Ullathorne reached Sydney
for the second time on Dec. 31st, 1838. On arrival he was hotly
attacked in the press for the evidence he had given before the
Transportation Committee, the colonists liking least his
denunciation of the system of assigning convicts to private
service. The storm seemed likely to render Dr. Ullathorne's further
residence in the colony impossible, but he found a warm supporter
in Judge (afterwards Sir Roger) Therry, and ultimately the
Catholics started a paper of their own in Sydney, under the
editorship of Mr. W. A. Duncan (q.v.), which effectually
championed his cause. Dr. Ullathorne was now stationed at
Parramatta, and in 1839 wrote his reply to Sir W. W. Burton's
work attacking the Catholics of New South Wales. In 1840, as the
result of a petition forwarded by the Catholic residents of
Adelaide to Bishop Polding, he was sent to that city to organise a
Church there and prepare the way for the appointment of a resident
ecclesiastic. In this object he succeeded, though he was very
coldly received by the civil authorities. On his return to Sydney,
Bishop Polding pressed on his acceptance the proposed see of Van
Diemen's Land, which was about to be formed under the scheme for
the establishment of an Australian hierarchy then being prepared at
the Vatican; but Dr. Ullathorne firmly repudiated the idea, saying
that he had seen enough of bishops to compassionate them, not to
envy them. Ultimately the Bishop consented to withdraw his name
from a list (which it headed) of suitable appointees for the
projected bishopric. About this time Dr. Ullathorne wrote to the
Sydney press deploring the inflation of land values, which he
justly predicted must shortly fall, to the great loss of the
over-speculative community in Sydney. On Nov. 16th, 1840, Dr.
Ullathorne left Sydney for what proved to be the last time, having
decided to accompany Bishop Polding on a visit which he had
resolved to make to Europe. They went viâ New Zealand and
South America, having decided to pay a visit to
Bishop Pompallier at Kororarika, N.Z., where they stayed
a fortnight en route. Arriving in London in May 1841, Dr.
Ullathorne did good service on behalf of the Australian Mission in
England and Ireland. Bishop Polding, who was, it was now
decided, to be appointed Archbishop of Sydney, then wrote to him
definitely announcing his appointment to the subordinate see of Van
Diemen's Land. In reply Dr. Ullathorne wrote declining, and the
Bishop then sent him a letter stating that their connection was at
an end. Subsequently, however, he wrote offering him the
appointment of first Bishop of Adelaide, in South Australia. This
too Dr. Ullathorne declined, and later on the new bishopric of
Perth, in Western Australia, to which, on his recommendation, Dr.
Brady, formerly of New South Wales, was appointed. When
Bishop Willson was nominated to the Tasmanian episcopate,
Dr. Ullathorne was inclined to go with him as Vicar-General, but
the idea dropped through, and Dr. Ullathorne ultimately assumed in
England the episcopal responsibilities which he had always shirked
in the colonies. Having, for a while returned to Downside, he was
then stationed at Coventry, appointed Vicar-Apostolic of the
western district, and consecrated Bishop of Hetalona in
partibus in June 1846. He was translated to the see of
Birmingham when the Catholic authorities restored the English
hierarchy in Sept. 1850. Amongst other works he published "A Reply
to Judge Burton" (1836); "Horrors of Transportation," and "The
Australian Mission" (1838); "Pilgrimage to La Salette" (1854); "The
Immaculate Conception" (1854); "Pilgrimage to the Monastery of
Subiaco and the Grotto of St. Benedict" (1856); "Letters on the
Association for promoting the Union of Christendom" (1865);
"Letters on the Conventual Life" (1868); "Letters on the Council
and Papal Infallibility" (1870); "Mr. Gladstone's Expostulation
Unravelled" (1875). As the diocesan of the late Cardinal Newman, he
was on the most affectionate terms with that eminent man.
Archbishop Ullathorne died on March 21st, 1889, having been allowed
to resign the see of Birmingham a short time previously on the plea
of age and infirmity. On his retirement the Pope appointed him an
archbishop in partibus. His autobiography, written in 1868,
with selections from his letters, was published in 1892 by the
eminent Catholic publishers, Burns, Oates, &amp; Co., of London,
who have since published in a separate volume "Letters of
Archbishop Ullathorne."</p>

when he was sent to St. Gregory's Roman Catholic College at
Downside, near Bath. In 1853 he entered on his novitiate, was
professed in the following year, and went to Rome in 1856 to
complete his study of divinity. He was ordained priest in 1859 by
Cardinal Patrick in the Church of St. John Lateran. Returning to
Downside in 1861, he engaged in parish work, and was made Professor
of Philosophy in the Benedictine Institution at St. Michael's, near
Hereford, and in the next year was elected to the Cathedral
priorship, which he held until his appointment as coadjutor to the
late Archbishop Polding of Sydney in 1873. He arrived in

Australian irrigation colonies, and has been engaged during the
last four years in making known to the public in Great Britain and
elsewhere the highly favourable conditions which Australia presents
as a fruit-producing country and the peculiar advantages for
high-class colonisation which are afforded by the colonies which he
represents. These were recently founded (although now very
remarkably developed) by the well-known brothers Chaffey, now
merged into the company of Chaffey Brothers, Limited. Mr. Vincent
himself resided, from considerations of health, for some nine or
ten years in Australia, nearly the whole of the settled portion of
which he has visited, and where he devoted himself to promoting
agricultural development in connection with the sugar industry of
Queensland on a system of co-operation amongst the whites which he
designed in order to dispense with the necessity for coloured
labour. Springing from an old family of yeomen in Dorsetshire, Mr.

articled to the editor of the Sherborne Journal, one of the
oldest newspapers in the west of England. Marrying the daughter of
R. J. L. Witty, C.E. (an inventor of note), his wife co-operated
with him in much subsequent journalistic and other public
work, embracing the establishment of several Liberal journals in
Warwickshire, one notably which he started in advocacy of rural and
agrarian reform, and which, as the organ of the National
Agricultural Labourers' Movement of 1872, had a weekly circulation
of some seventy thousand copies, and was frequently mentioned in
the House of Commons and the leading papers of the day in
connection with the land question. Mr. Vincent, among much other
public work, initiated and convened the first thoroughly
representative National Farm Labourers' Conference at Leamington in
1872 (under the presidency of Mr. George Dixon, M.P.), which
brought out Joseph Arch as the national champion of the interests
of his class, also Sir Baldwin Leighton, Bart., as the earliest
advocate of the "three acres and a cow" system, and has since led
to important political results. Advocating the nationalisation of
the land and being strongly opposed to strikes, Mr. Vincent seceded
in 1875 (after three years of arduous work) from the Labourers'
Union, of which he was honorary treasurer, and started a national
scheme, under the presidency of Professor F. W. Newman, for
acquiring land to furnish farm labourers, on a self-helpful basis,
with small holdings and allotments, but had to relinquish his
connection with it on account of impaired health.</p>

<p><a name="A1428" id="A1428"></a><b>Vogel, Hon. Sir Julius</b>,
K.C.M.G., sometime Premier of New Zealand, is the son of Albert
Leopold Vogel, of London, and Phoebe his wife, eldest daughter of
Alexander Isaac, of Hatcham Grove, Surrey, and Wolsingham Park,
Durham, and was born in London on Feb. 24th, 1835, and educated at
home and at London University School. At the age of sixteen he went
into mercantile pursuits, but migrated to Victoria after the
discovery of the goldfields in 1852. In Victoria he was concerned
in various business pursuits, and subsequently became editor of
the Maryborough and Dunolly Advertiser, and proprietor of
other country papers. After an unsuccessful attempt to enter the
Victorian Parliament, he proceeded, in 1861, to Dunedin, N.Z., and
shortly afterwards purchased a half-share in the Otago
Witness, and started the Otago Daily Times, the first daily
paper in New Zealand. Both these papers Mr. Vogel edited for
several years. In 1862 he entered the Provincial Council of Otago,
and in 1866 became head of the Provincial Government, which office
he held till 1869. He entered the House of Representatives in 1863.
In 1869 he joined the Fox Ministry, being Colonial Treasurer from
June 1869 to Sept. 1872, Commissioner of Stamps from June 1869 to
Sept. 1872, Postmaster-General from August 1869 to Sept 1872,
Commissioner of Customs from August 1869 to Jan. 1871 and Nov. 1871
to Sept. 1872, and Electric Telegraph commissioner from July 1869
to Sept. 1872. Upon the assumption of office by the Ministry, Mr.
Fox announced the intention of retiring from aggressive operations
in the Maori war. It was resolved that the better policy of the
country lay in encouraging immigration, so that the colonists might
soon be numerous and strong enough to be without fear in the event
of fresh native troubles. With this view the Ministry decided to
open up the interior of the North Island by a vigorous policy of
public works and immigration. Thus was Mr. Vogel's famous public
works scheme set on foot. At this time there were many difficulties
to surmount. In the first place the Middle Islanders had bitterly
complained that a great part of the cost of the Maori wars fell
upon them, and the Government had to find proposals acceptable to
them; and in the next place they had to overcome the opposition of
the Provincial Councils, who would resent any intrusion on their
functions. Mr. Vogel expounded his policy on June 28th, 1870, in
the annual budget, and subsequently it was accepted by the Houses.
Two commissioners, Dr. Featherstone and Mr. (now Sir) Francis
D. Bell, were sent to England to confer with the Imperial
Government, and succeeded in persuading them to guarantee a loan
of one million for public works and immigration, to be spent
at a rate not exceeding £200,000 a year. The proposals embraced in
the scheme of the Government included the construction of a trunk
railway through each island, and the expenditure of ten millions
during the following ten years on these railways, on immigration,
on roads, and on the extension of the telegraph lines. Mr. Vogel
proposed to constitute a railway estate of about six millions of
acres, the land to be taken within the provinces in proportion to
the expenditure therein. He did not venture to propose a loan of
ten millions, as the colony was not in a position at the time to
ask it; but he maintained that the expenditure could be arranged
partly by loan, partly by payment in land, partly by guarantee. The
plan was adopted during the session, bat Parliament would not
pledge itself to a through trunk line in each island, and the
provincial interest prevailed against the establishment of a
railway landed estate. Mr. Vogel also at this time established the
San Francisco mail service, the arrangements for which he concluded
with the United States, assisted by the Home Government. His
suggestion that the Navigation Islands should be placed under
British protection was not, however, taken up. During his visit to
England, in connection with the loans and the postal service, Mr.
Vogel was mainly instrumental in obtaining the passage of the
Australian Colonial Duties Act in 1873, by which the colonies were
permitted to enter into reciprocal tariff arrangements with each
other. Mr. Vogel also entered into negotiations with the Admiralty
upon the subject of colonial defence, and the result was that
Colonel (afterwards Sir William) Jervois drew up the outlines of a
scheme of defence of the principal New Zealand towns. He returned
in 1871 to New Zealand. In Jan. 1873 he was one of the delegates to
the Intercolonial Conference, held at Sydney, for the settlement,
among other questions, of the European mail service. In Sept. 1872
the Fox- Vogel Government, being defeated, was succeeded by the
Stafford Ministry; but this government retired on Oct. 11th, and
Mr. Vogel formed a cabinet, of which Mr. Waterhouse was Premier,
and Mr. Vogel himself Colonial Treasurer and Postmaster-General.
While Mr. Vogel was absent in Sydney Mr. Waterhouse resigned (March
3rd, 1873), on the ground that he had not sufficient influence in
the ministry, and Mr. Fox accepted the temporary premiership till
April 8th, when Mr. Vogel returned and assumed the position in
addition to his other offices. He also became Telegraph
Commissioner, and was Minister for Immigration from Oct. 1873 to
Sept. 1874. Among the important Acts carried through by Mr. Vogel
during his tenure of office were those establishing a Government
Life Insurance and a Public Trust Office. He also passed an Act for
the establishment of public forests, which was afterwards repealed,
and made an attempt to incorporate a company for the trade and
government of the unclaimed Pacific Islands. Before the end of 1874
a resolution was passed which subsequently led to the abolition of
the provinces. In the end of the year Mr. Vogel went to London to
negotiate a large loan, and to arrange for the establishment of
cable communication between New Zealand and Australia. In both
missions he was successful. Before leaving England Sir Julius Vogel
(who had by this time been knighted) concluded an arrangement with
the Bank of England and the Home Government by which some time
later (August 1877) an Act was passed authorising the inscription
of colonial stock. Early in 1876 Sir Julius returned to New
Zealand, and resumed his place as premier, which had been filled in
the interim by Dr. Pollen. Upon the death of Dr. Featherston at the
end of the same year, Sir Julius succeeded him as Agent-General,
and returned once again to London. He remained Agent-General till
Feb. 1881, and negotiated a loan of five millions for the colony in
1879. In 1880 he unsuccessfully contested Penryn in the
Conservative interest. In 1884 he went to New Zealand, and
re-entered public life, becoming Colonial Treasurer,
Postmaster-General, Telegraph Commissioner, and Commissioner of
Customs in the Stout-Vogel Government, which took office in Sept.
1884. In order to relieve the depressed condition of the colony,
Sir Julius now created debentures to an amount equivalent to the
accretions of the sinking funds. This plan, though much criticised
at the time, has been again resorted to since. On Oct. 8th, 1887,
the Stout-Vogel Government was defeated, and Sir Harry
Atkinson came into office. Since then Sir Julius Vogel has
lived in London. He was created C.M.G. in 1872 and K.C.M.G. in
1875. He is the author of "Anno Domini 2000" (Hutchinson, 1888),
and has contributed many articles to the leading reviews, chiefly
on the subject of imperial federation, of which he was one of the
earliest advocates. He married, in 1867, Mary, eldest daughter of
W. A. Clayton, Colonial Architect of New Zealand.</p>

<p><a name="A1429" id="A1429"></a><b>Von Tempsky, Major Gustavus
F.</b>, was a Prussian by birth, and belonged to a family of
position. He entered the Prussian army at an early age, and after
serving in the Hussars went out to South America in search of
adventure. He was an excellent linguist and a man of high literary
attainments, his book of travels in South America being widely
read. Subsequently he led a wandering life, first on the
Californian goldfields and then on those of Victoria, but
ultimately proceeded to Central America, whence he went to New
Zealand and offered himself for service in the Waikato war of 1863.
His offer was accepted, and he was appointed in August of that year
ensign of a company of Forest Rangers, raised mainly at his own
expense, with the view of carrying on similar operations against
the Maoris to those to which Von Tempsky had been accustomed in
Central America against the Indians. He subsequently greatly
distinguished himself at Paparatio, Patirangi, Orakau, Wanganui,
and Kakaramea. At a dinner given in his honour by the Premier, the
latter declared that Major von Tempsky had done more to raise the
character of the colonial force than any other officer, and that he
was the great bulwark of the self-reliant policy; yet the very next
day the Major was ordered to proceed to Waiapu and place himself
under the command of Lieut.-Col. Fraser, a newly arrived officer
from England. Major von Tempsky objected to being subordinated to a
junior officer of very recent standing in the colonial force, and
sent in his resignation. His men at the same time refused to
proceed without him. The Government declined to accept the Major's
resignation, and requested him to induce his men to abandon their
mutinous attitude. He refused to move in the matter, and was then
categorically asked whether he would proceed to Napier and report
himself to his commanding officer. This he again refused to do, and
pressed for the acceptance of his resignation. He was then deprived
of his sword and placed under close arrest. Ultimately the affair
was smoothed over, and Major von Tempsky rejoined the service. At
the close of the campaign he went to reside in Auckland, and
painted a number of pictures of encounters with the Maoris. When
the Armed Constabulary was formed, he accepted an inspectorship in
the force, and was killed in the ill-fated engagement with the
followers of Titokowaru at Nguto-o-te-Manu on Sept. 7th, 1868. The
chief command on this fatal occasion was held by a Lieut.-Col.
McDonnell, who led one party of Europeans, and Major von Tempsky
another. The Maoris planned a successful ambush, and Major von
Tempsky was shot dead whilst in the act of encouraging his men.</p>

celebrated Maori orator, belonging to the Ngatimaniapoto tribe,
held for many years the position of Prime Minister to "King
Tawhiao." After this potentate had made his submission to the
authorities, Wahanui desired to lay before the New Zealand
Parliament a statement of Maori grievances, and in the end obtained
permission to be heard at the bar of the House, his speech on the
occasion being remarkably eloquent and able. Wahanui was afterwards
offered a seat in the Legislative Council, but declined it on the
ground that it would minimise his Maori chieftainship, and damage
him in the eyes of his people.</p>

<p><a name="A1432" id="A1432"></a><b>Waharoa, Wiremu Tamihana
Te</b> (William Thompson), the Maori kingmaker, was the second
son of Te Waharoa, the great chief of the central districts of
the North Island of New Zealand. His name was originally
Tarapipipi, but in embracing Christianity he was baptised as
William Thompson. He succeeded his father in 1839, and was
concerned in many conflicts with the Europeans through his espousal
of the Maori king movement, of which he was the main promoter,
hence his title of kingmaker. As he explained in his admirable
letter to the Governor of New Zealand in June 1861, "the reason why
I set up Potatau as a king for me was, he was a man of extended
influence, and one who was respected by the tribes of this island.
That, O, my friend, was why I set him up&mdash;to put down my troubles,
to hold the land of the slaves, and to judge the offences of the
chiefs." In March 1861, at the request of Bishop Selwyn, he
opened negotiations for a peaceful understanding without result. In
Jan. 1863 Wi Tamihana had a conference with Sir George Grey,
who had just been appointed to his second governorship of New
Zealand, at Taupiri. He explained the King movement. It had long,
he said, been in the minds of the Maoris, and he hoped that under
the King good laws, approved by the Governor, would be made. He
asked the Governor if he were opposed to their king, and he
received the memorable reply, "I shall not fight against him with
the sword, but I shall dig round him till he falls of his own
accord." This was thought a decidedly menacing reply, but Wi
Tamihana still tried to avoid war. He went to Mr. (now Sir John)
Gorst at Te Awamatu, and advised him to leave the Waikato, where he
had been appointed resident, and had started a school and
newspaper. The chief believed, as Mr. Moss says, in the school
himself, but began to fear that they "might be some of the spades
with which the Governor was digging round their king." Sir George
Grey at this juncture decided to rescind the purchase of the
Waitara block, which had been the cause of so much trouble between
the whites and Maoris. This policy was, however, adopted by his
Ministry too late, as war had again broken out, much as it was
deprecated by Wi Tamihana, who made repeated attempts to restore
peace. At length, disgusted by the atrocities of the Hau Haus, he
made open submission to the Government, On May 25th, 1865, with
sixty of his chiefs and people, Wi Tamihana met General Carey by
appointment at Tamahiri, near the present town of Hamilton, and
formally tendered his submission, which was accepted in a kind and
complimentary manner by the English general. Wi Tamihana then wrote
on the fly sheet of a letter produced at his request by one of the
aides-de-camp, "I have made peace, as witness my coming into the
presence of my antagonist, the General. The laws of the Queen shall
be the laws of the King. (Signed) Wiremu Tamihana Te Waharoa. The
following year Wi Tamihana presented a petition for inquiry into
the causes of the Maori war, and went to Wellington to give
evidence before a Parliamentary select committee on Maori affairs.
He was conveyed to the capital in a Government warship, and was
treated with marked consideration by the members of the
Legislature. He died on Dec. 28th, 1866, and may be regarded as one
of the noblest embodiments of Maori magnanimity with which their
colonisation of New Zealand brought the British race in
contact.</p>

Zealand. He was a very prominent leader of the friendly tribes
during the Maori war, distinguishing himself on several occasions
by his personal bravery, especially in the operations against the
Hau Haus in 1865 and in the pursuit of Te Kooti. He received the
decoration of the New Zealand Cross, as
the Gazette states, "for his personal gallantry and loyal
devotion on the occasion both of the first and last attacks on
Ngatapa, and more especially for the courage he showed on the first
occasion, at the head of only seventy men, when all the rest of the
native contingent had retreated and left him without support; Major
Bopata then pushed his way close to the entrenchments and held a
position at a pistol-shot distance all day, and until, under cover
of night, he was compelled by want of ammunition to retire, having
sustained heavy losses." Ngatapa, in the Poverty Bay district, was
the stronghold of Te Kooti; and its capture took place in the
winter of 1868-9. For his services in this connection a sword of
honour was sent him by her Majesty in 1870,</p>

history of New Zealand as the friend of the white man. He lived at
the Bay of Islands, which was the place first selected for
irregular colonisation, and from the beginning gave the intruders a
generous welcome. He used his influence with the Maoris to sign the
Treaty of Waitangi. In after years, when Hoani Heke commenced
hostilities against the settlers at Kororarika, the friendship of
Tamati Waka was invaluable. In his old age he received a
well-merited pension of £100 per annum from the British Government
in recognition of his long and faithful service. In 1861 the Queen
sent him a silver cup as a mark of her friendship; and in 1868 he
had an interview with Sir George Bowen at Waitangi. He
lived to an extreme old age, and died at Russell (Kororarika) on
August 4th, 1871, where his remains are interred under a modest
monument erected at the public expense.</p>

<p><a name="A1435" id="A1435"></a><b>Wakefield, Edward</b>, is the
fifth son of the late Felix Wakefield (q.v.) and was born
at Launceston, Tas., on May 22nd, 1845, being taken to England in
his infancy. His father brought him to New Zealand in 1851, and he
was afterwards for some time under the care of his
uncle, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, at Wellington. In 1855 he
returned to England, and was educated at King's College, London. In
1863 he was back again in New Zealand and attached to the staff of
the Nelson Examiner. Two years later he was appointed to a
Civil Service clerkship, and in 1866 became private secretary to
the Premier, Sir Edward Stafford. He was subsequently
confidential secretary to the New Zealand Cabinet, and held the
post for four years. He was then in the Customs for a short period,
but again connected himself with journalism, editing
the Evening Press at Wellington with conspicuous ability.
Mr. Wakefield was elected M.H.R. for Geraldine in Dec. 1875, and
was re-elected in 1879. In 1880 he was chairman of the Royal
Commission on Local Industries, and in the next year was defeated
for Geraldine, and for Inanghua in 1883. In May 1884 he was
returned for Selwyn, and again in the following July, unopposed. In
the short-lived Atkinson Government of August to Sept.
1884 he was Colonial Secretary. Shortly afterwards he left the
colony, and has recently resided principally in America. He has
published a work on the progress of New Zealand during the past
fifty years.</p>

<p><a name="A1436" id="A1436"></a><b>Wakefield, Edward Gibbon</b>,
the well-known promoter of colonisation and founder of the colonies
of South Australia and New Zealand, was the eldest son of Edward
Wakefield, of Burnham Hall, Essex, and was born in 1796, being
educated for the Bar. In 1826 he became notorious by his abduction
of a young heiress named Ellen Turner, whose father was High
Sheriff of Cheshire, and whose fortune he coveted. He was sentenced
to three years' imprisonment, and the marriage, which had been
solemnised at Gretna Green, was dissolved by Act of Parliament. By
indomitable persistency, and possession of great capacity, Mr.
Wakefield managed to overlive the stigma of this disgraceful
episode. He wrote copiously on constitutional subjects and those
connected with the condition of the depressed classes of society.
He was deeply interested in the question of colonising the British
dependencies, and wrote "Letters from Sydney," a work on Australian
colonisation, so full of local colouring and data, that it was
generally accepted as a genuine record of travel and experience. In
1833 was published his great work, "A View of the Art of
Colonisation." In this book were broached the new theories of
colonisation with which his name is indissolubly linked, and on the
principles of which the great colonies of South Australia and New
Zealand were subsequently founded. His main idea was the sale of
the public lands at an upset price and the devotion of the proceeds
to the promotion of industrial immigration. With the aid of Robert
Rentoul, editor of the Spectator, and of Sir William
Molesworth, he attacked the system of convict transportation, and
struck it a mortal blow. He was private secretary to the Earl of
Durham in his mission to Canada after the rebellion, and was mainly
instrumental in establishing self-government in that dependency.
Having taken a deep interest in the colonisation of New Zealand
under the auspices of the New Zealand Company, of which he was
the leading spirit, he assisted in the foundation of the Canterbury
and Otago settlements under separate associations. In 1852 he at
last saw the land of promise which he had recommended to so many
others. He at first settled in Canterbury, but subsequently lived
at Wellington, becoming a member of the local Provincial Council.
In 1854 he was elected M.H.R. for the Hutt district, but was
obliged to retire through ill-health after one session's experience
of parliamentary life. He took a leading part in the struggle which
preceded the actual initiation of responsible government, which had
been presumably granted, but which was withheld from operation by
the acting Governor, largely on the irresponsible, and, as its
advocates argued, unconstitutional advice of Gibbon Wakefield
himself, Mr. Wakefield, though at first prompting the Lower House
to demand it, ultimately adopting a temporising policy. He died at
Wellington on May 16th, 1862. Besides Mr. Felix
Wakefield (q.v.), Mr. Wakefield had three other brothers who
made a home in New Zealand, viz., Arthur, a captain R.N., who
founded the Nelson settlement in 1841 as agent of the New Zealand
Company, and was killed by the Maoris at the lamentable affair
known as the Wairu massacre on June 17th, 1843; William, who,
though educated for the diplomatic service, was a colonel in the
British auxiliary force in Spain, where he served from 1832 to
1834. He was the real founder of New Zealand on his brother's
plans. In 1839 he went out as the principal agent of the New
Zealand Company and selected the site of the Port Nicholson
(Wellington) settlement, and in the next year the first colonists
arrived. At the start of the settlement he was its ruler as
chairman of the governing committee. He concluded the celebrated
Ngaitapu purchase at Akaroa in 1843, by which the Maoris parted
with the South Island to the whites. Colonel Wakefield married in
1826 Emily Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Shelley Sidney, of
Penshurst Place, and sister of Philip, first Lord de Lisle and
Dudley, by whom he had an only daughter, who married
Sir Edward W. Stafford, afterwards Premier of New Zealand. He
died at Wellington in 1848; Daniel, who emigrated to the Wellington
settlement in 1844, and became a judge of the Supreme Court of New
Zealand.</p>

<p><a name="A1437" id="A1437"></a><b>Wakefield, Edward
Jerningham</b>, only son of Edward Gibbon
Wakefield (q.v.) proceeded to New Zealand with his uncle
Colonel William Wakefield, who was the principal agent of the New
Zealand Company, and who took the leading part in founding the
Wellington settlement in the years 1839-40. Mr. Wakefield remained
in New Zealand till 1844, when he returned to England, and in the
two following years occupied himself, at his father's instigation,
in promoting the Church of England settlement in Canterbury and the
Presbyterian settlement in Otago. Returning to New Zealand, Mr.
Wakefield represented a Canterbury constituency in the first House
of Representatives elected under the new Constitution Act in 1854,
and was a member of the Executive Council from August to Sept.
during the inchoate period which preceded the initiation of regular
responsible government. He was again an M.H.R. in 1876, and died at
Christchurch the same year. He was the author of "Adventures in New
Zealand," published in 1845; "A Letter to Sir George Grey in reply
to his Attacks on the Canterbury Association and Settlement"
(Lyttelton, N.Z., 1851); "The Founders of Canterbury, being Letters
from the late Edward Gibbon Wakefield to John Robert Godley and to
other Well-known Helpers in the Foundation of the Settlement of
Canterbury, in New Zealand" (Christchurch, N.Z., 1868).</p>

<p><a name="A1438" id="A1438"></a><b>Wakefield, Felix</b>, was the
fifth son of Edward Wakefield, of Burnham Hall, Essex, and younger
brother of Edward Gibbon Wakefield. He was born in 1807, and
was educated as an engineer. In early life he was Superintendent of
Public Works in Tasmania. Returning to England in 1847, he threw
himself with energy into his brother's colonising schemes, and took
an active part in establishing the Canterbury settlement in the
colony of New Zealand, to which he himself emigrated in 1851, the
allotment which he took up being No. 2, now the site of the town of
Sumner. Being an enthusiastic botanist, he distributed seeds and
cuttings, from which many of the plantations in the vicinity of
Christchurch had their rise. On his return after a visit to England
in 1854, he brought out to Nelson the first red deer,
pheasants, and other animals and birds. On the outbreak of the
Crimean war he returned to England, and was made principal
superintendent of the Army Works Corps at the seat of war, being
given the rank of lieutenant-colonel and employed in making the
railway from Balaclava to Sebastopol. After the peace he travelled
in Russia, Turkey, Syria, and Egypt, returning in 1863 to New
Zealand, where he at first lived at Nelson, and subsequently at
Sumner. He died suddenly at the latter place on Dec. 24th,
1876.</p>

Majesty's 54th Regiment, and brother of the well-known publishers
Messrs. Walch, of Tasmania. Mr. Walch was born in Tasmania in 1843,
but passed some of his earlier years in England and on the
Continent. On the completion of his education he returned to
Australia, where he was at first engaged in commercial pursuits,
but later on developed a taste for press work, and was employed as
a writer on several of the leading papers of New South Wales. He
also started a journal of his own, known as the Cumberland
Times, but his first independent literary venture appeared as
recently as 1870, when he published a series of Christmas stories,
under the title of "Fireflash." At Christmas 1871 he produced his
original extravaganza Trookulentos, which achieved great
success. Removing to Victoria, toward the close of 1872, he
produced True Blue Beard at the Prince of Wales' Theatre
(now the Opera House), and early next year a burlesque
entitled Pygmalion and his Gal a dear, followed by his
extravaganzas Australia Felix and Adamatna, both
played at the Opera House. In 1874 he published a volume of
humorous verse and prose, "Head over Heels," and next year a
grotesquely illustrated work styled "On the Cards." His next
Melbourne pantomime was an adaptation of "Froggie would a-wooing
go," while in Sydney was played his original version of Beauty
and the Beast, the Theatre Royal of each city being
the locale of production. In 1876, besides a variety of
dramiettes written to introduce Dr. Silvester's ghost effects, Mr.
Walch wrote his pantomime Hey Diddle Diddle for the
Melbourne Theatre Royal, a fresh version of
his Trookulentos being also played in New Zealand. Mr.
Walch subsequently produced a dramatisation of "Helen's Babies" and
a comedy styled Humble-pie, besides others which it is
needless to enumerate. In addition to the above, Mr. Walch has
written several localised versions of popular burlesques and
bouffes and a number of descriptive lectures. Shortly after his
arrival in Melbourne Mr. Walch was chosen out of a hundred and
fifteen applicants to fill the post of secretary to the Melbourne
Athenæum, the leading literary institute of Australia. This post he
resigned in 1882. He edited a handsome illustrated volume entitled
"Victoria in 1880," published locally.</p>

1832, and began the work of their mission. They remained three
years in Tasmania, visiting all the settled districts, inspecting
chain gangs and convict stations, including those of Macquarie
Harbour and Port Arthur. From Hobart they proceeded to Sydney, and
spent two years in similar work in New South Wales, extending their
travels to Moreton Bay (now Brisbane) and to Norfolk Island, which
they found to be Macquarie Harbour over again with an extra shade
of darkness. Their reports to the Governors of Tasmania and New
South Wales had considerable influence in inducing reforms in
the treatment of the prisoners. Returning to Hobart, they sailed
thence for South Africa. On their way they visited Melbourne, at
that time (1837) a mere group of huts, also Adelaide and Swan River
(Western Australia). Arriving at the Cape, they travelled by waggon
to the utmost bounds to which white men had then penetrated,
visiting the mission stations and inquiring into the condition of
the native races. His eight years of missionary travel completed,
Mr. Walker returned to Hobart, where he married a daughter of the
late Mr. Robert Mather, and for some years carried on business as a
draper. He was one of the founders of the Hobart Savings Bank
(1845), of which he undertook the direction, and eventually gave up
his business to become manager of the institution. He was an
earnest advocate and promoter of the temperance and other
philanthropic movements. He died at Hobart Feb. 1st, 1859. A life
of Mr. Walker, by Backhouse and Tylor, was published in London
(1862). The Walker family belonged originally to Wylam-on-Tyne,
near Newcastle, having held an estate there from the time of the
Reformation. About the middle of last century an elder branch
migrated south to the neighbourhood of Leeds, while the branch from
which Mr. Walker was descended went into business at
Newcastle-on-Tyne. The family were Unitarians, but when a young man
Mr. Walker joined the Society of Friends. He began life as owner of
pottery works near Newcastle, but, owing to losses through the
misconduct of a relative, the works were given up.</p>

<p><a name="A1446" id="A1446"></a><b>Wallace, William Vincent</b>,
the eminent musical composer, was the son of Samuel Wallace,
bandmaster of the 17th Regiment, with which he was for some time
stationed in Sydney, N.S.W. The future musician was born at
Waterford, Ireland, on March 11th, 1815. He was placed in the
orchestra of the Hawkins Street Theatre, Dublin, when he was
fourteen, and took the direction when he was sixteen. In 1835,
being in delicate health, he went to Australia, with the intention
of abandoning music, and turning his hand to the hard work of
colonial pioneering. He spent some time in the New South Wales
"bush," to the west of Sydney, but ultimately decided to give a
concert in the metropolis, for which he secured the patronage of
the then governor, Sir Richard Bourke. It was given in aid of
the building fund of the Roman Catholic Cathedral, and its success
may be judged from the fact that £1000 was realised for the object
desired. Mr. Wallace now applied himself vigorously to composition
in private, and violin playing in public. He also gave lessons on
the latter instrument. He travelled professionally through the
Australasian colonies, and, as narrated by Mr. Hogan, was made
prisoner in New Zealand by a band of Maoris, who would have
promptly murdered him but for the interposition of the chiefs
daughter. He also went on a whaling voyage with a native crew who
mutinied, when he had another very narrow escape of losing his
life. Subsequently, his health having in the meantime improved, he
proceeded to India, South America, Mexico and the United States,
returning in 1845 to London, where he completed his
opera Maritana, a great part of which had been scored in
Sydney. This opera was produced with great success at Drury Lane
Theatre, and his fame as a composer was established. He afterwards
wrote Matilda of Hungary, Amber Witch, Lurline, Love's
Triumph, and The Desert Flower. In 1864 he went to Paris, and
died on Oct. 12th, 1865.</p>

to 1848, when he entered a merchant's office in Liverpool. In 1852
he emigrated to Victoria, and engaged in mercantile pursuits, which
he varied by literary work. Mr. Wallen is known throughout
Australia under the pseudonym of "Aegles" the signature under which
he for twenty years contributed to

Yeomanry Cavalry, was for many years president of the Art Union of
Victoria, and was the first chairman of the Melbourne Stock
Exchange&mdash;a post to which he was twice afterwards re-elected. He
married in Melbourne on May 21st, 1863, Miss Marian May Pitman, and

moderatorship in logic and ethics. In Nov. 1847 he was called to
the Irish Bar, and in 1853 emigrated to Victoria, where he
practised his profession at Ballarat for some years from 1855. In
1871 he entered the Legislative Assembly for Ballarat East, and was

Egerton Warburton, of Arley Hall, Cheshire, by his marriage with
Emma, daughter of James Croxton, was born on August 15th, 1813, at
Arley Hall, and was primarily educated in France. In 1826 he
entered the royal navy, and  in 1829 proceeded to Addiscombe
College,  preparatory to entering the East India
Company's service, in which he remained  from 1831 until 1853,
when he retired  with the rank of major. He emigrated  to
Western Australia, arriving at Albany  in July 1853; but went
to Adelaide in  September, and at the end of the year
was appointed Commissioner of Police.  This position he held
till 1867, and in  1869 he became Colonel Commandant of
the South Australian Volunteer Force, a  position from which
he retired in 1877.  He was subsequently placed in
charge  of the Imperial Pension Department.  Between 1856
and 1874 Major Warburton  conducted several exploring
expeditions.  In April 1873 he started from Adelaide  on
an expedition across the continent  with seventeen camels,
three Europeans  and two Afghans. His route lay across
the sandhills that baffled the brothers Gregory; but with the aid
of the camels, and by his own indomitable energy, he succeeded in
reaching an out-station in Western Australia. Nine months and a
half had been occupied in making the terrible journey of nine
hundred miles. During the latter part of their wanderings the party
subsisted on the flesh of the worn-out camels, and on rare
occasions on a few wallabies which they got from the natives. For
his services as an explorer Warburton obtained the Royal
Geographical Society's medal, with a vote from the South Australian
Parliament of £1000 for himself and £500 for his party. Sir Thomas
Elder sent him to England, and published the narrative of his
explorations, and he was created a C.M.G. in 1875. Major Warburton
married, in Oct. 1838, Alicia, daughter of H. Mant, of Bath. He
died on Dec. 16th, 1889.</p>

wife, daughter of the first Earl of Glandore. His father's eldest
brother became the third Viscount Bangor, and Mr. Crosbie Ward was
first cousin to the late Sir E. W. Ward, K.C.M.G. (q.v.). He
was born in 1833, and was educated at the College School,
Castletown, Isle of Man, and at Trinity College, Dublin. He
emigrated to New Zealand in 1852, being one of the pioneers of the
Canterbury Church of England settlement in that colony. In March
1855 he was elected to the Provincial Council of Canterbury for
Akaroa, and in the following Dec. he stood for the New Zealand
House of Representatives for Christchurch country district, but was
defeated. He again contested the constituency in Oct. 1856, but was
again unsuccessful. In May 1858, however, he was elected to the
House for Lyttelton, for which he was also returned to the
Provincial Council later in the same year. In August 1861 he
accepted office in the Fox Ministry as Postmaster-General and
Secretary for Crown Lands. Resigning with his chief in August of
the next year, he was a few days later reappointed
Postmaster-General under Mr. Domett, retiring with his colleagues
in Oct. 1863. Early in that year he had been sent to England to
negotiate for the establishment of a mail
service via Panama, and this he successfully achieved,
and on his return in March 1864 was offered his old portfolio of
Postmaster-General by the then Premier, Sir Frederick Weld. He,
however, declined to re-enter office, and engaged in an agitation
for the separation of the North and South islands of New Zealand.
Whilst in England as the representative of the Domett Government,
he discussed the question of the war expenditure with the Imperial
Government, and published a defence of the colony in a letter
addressed to Lord Lyttelton, one of the founders of the Canterbury
settlement. Mr. Ward became connected with the Lyttelton
Times as a part proprietor in July 1856, and was a voluminous
and very able contributor to its columns. Shortly after his refusal
to join the Weld Government, Mr. Ward was appointed agent in
England for the province of Canterbury, and died in London whilst

Curnow in the pastorate of the largest Wesleyan Church in Sydney.
He, however, resigned the ministry, and became a writer for
the Sydney Morning Herald, He subsequently took the editorship
of the Echo and the Sydney Mail, the former an
evening paper and the latter a weekly journal, connected with
the Sydney Morning Herald. In the year 1885 Mr. Ward was

morning paper established in Sydney. He accepted this, and
conducted the paper with great ability until 1890, when, differing
with the company owning the paper on a question of editorial
management, he resigned his post. In 1891 he proceeded to London,
and acted for a year as head of the Melbourne Age and
Sydney Daily Telegraph cable syndicate, a position

<p><a name="A1458" id="A1458"></a><b>Ward, Mrs.
Humphry</b> (Mary Augusta Arnold), now known all over the
English-speaking world under her married name, Mrs. Humphry Ward,
was born in Tasmania on June 11th, 1851. Her father was Thomas
Arnold (q.v.), second son of Dr. Arnold of Rugby, and brother
of the late Matthew Arnold, and her mother a granddaughter of
Colonel Sorell, formerly Governor of Tasmania. She was born at
Hobart, Tasmania, the eldest of a family of six, and was sent to a
school at Ambleside, kept by Miss Clough, the late Principal of
Newnham College. In 1864 she was sent to Miss May's School at
Clifton; and in the following year, on her father renouncing the
Church of Rome, she migrated with the family to Oxford. Here the
future novelist and religious reformer came under the influence of
Mark Pattison, Rector of Lincoln, who advised her strongly to
"specialise" her studies. Acting on this advice, she taught herself
Spanish, and then set to work to study certain points in early
Spanish literature and history, with a zeal to which the Bodleian
library ministered. In 1872 she married Mr. Humphry Ward, at that
time a Fellow and Tutor of Brasenose College. Mrs. Ward thenceforth
embarked on a literary career, contributing during the years that
followed to the Saturday Review, the Guardian,
the Academy, and the Pall Mall Gazette. At Oxford she
produced her first book, "Milly and Olly," a book for children, and
assisted her husband in his work on "The English Poets." She also
revealed her theological bent and her love of antiquarian subjects
by her valuable contributions to Dr. Wace's "Dictionary of
Christian Biography," for which she wrote the lives of some of the
early Spanish bishops and saints&mdash;a work which was entrusted to her
on the advice of certain Oxford friends, who sent the learned
editor to Mrs. Ward. The result of her research into the
semi-legendary material of early Spanish church history may be
traced in almost every chapter of "Robert Elsmere." In 1881 Mr.
Humphry Ward, having accepted a post on the staff of
the Times, left Oxford for London; and Mrs. Ward continued to
write for the Pall Mall Gazette, then under the editorship of
Mr. John Morley. In 1883 Mrs. Humphry Ward published "Miss
Bretherton," a novel which, though it reached a second edition and
was favourably noticed in the press, did not attain any very wide
popularity. She next contributed some singularly thoughtful and
introspective articles to Macmillan's Magazine, and translated
the mystical "Journal Intime" of Amiel, whose character suggested
Langham in "Robert Elsmere." This last work, the one by which Mrs.
Humphry Ward has made her name world-famous, was begun in 1885, and
took two years and eight months to write, appearing in Feb. 1888,
when it achieved an immediate and phenomenal success, towards which
Mr. Gladstone may in some measure have contributed by a critical
paper in one of the monthly reviews. In America, and throughout the
British colonies, "Robert Elsmere" created almost as great a
sensation as in England, where it gave rise not only to serious and
protracted controversies, but, in an indirect way, led to the
establishment of University Hall, in Gordon Square, Bloomsbury. Of
this institution Mrs. Humphry Ward, if not the actual founder, was
the chief inspirer; and she delivered a remarkable inaugural
address at the Portman Rooms, upon which occasion the Rev. Stopford
Brooke presided, and the venerable Dr. Martineau sat beside her on
the platform. This address&mdash;Mrs. Ward's first appearance as a
public speaker&mdash;was published in pamphlet form, and received much
attention in the English press. Mrs. Humphry Ward published in 1892
her second novel: "The History of David Grieve."</p>

this being the only instance in Australasian history of the office
of Premier being successively held by the same person in two
colonies. In March of the next year, however, he resigned, finding
that, with the leadership of the Lower House vested in Mr. (now Sir

Dec. 20th, 1863, at Caulfield, Melbourne, of which parish his
father was then incumbent. At the age of nine he was taken to New
Zealand, on the occasion of his father's appointment to the cure of
St. John's, Christchurch, and was educated at the grammar school of
that town, and afterwards at Canterbury College. In May 1883 he
graduated at the New Zealand University, and came to England early
in 1885, where he has since lived. In 1887 Mr. Watson took up
journalistic work, and was a frequent contributor to the St.
James's Gazette and other papers. In 1888 he published
"Marahuna: a Romance" (Longmans), and in the spring of 1890, "Lady
FaintHeart" (Chapman &amp; Hall), a novel in three volumes. Mr.
Watson, who is now a regular contributor to
the National (late Scots) Observer, has published a
tale of adventure in the Maori war, called " The Web of the Spider"
(Hutchinson &amp; Co., 1891). He is joint author with Mr. J. M.
Barrie, the novelist, of a play called Richard Savage, which
was produced at a Criterion matinee in April 1891.</p>

<p><a name="A1465" id="A1465"></a><b>Watson, Rev. Henry Crocker
Marriott</b>, was born at Prossers, in Tasmania, on Nov. 9th, 1835,
and is on the father's side of Irish descent, his grandfather being
of Tipperary, the family estate, "Brook Watson," near Nenagh,
having, only as recently as 1857, passed into other hands. Mr.
Watson's father, Brereton Rolla Ross Porter Bloomfield Watson,
emigrated in 1821, when very young, to Tasmania where he married
Miss Catherine Wade. Mr. Watson was educated in Tasmania, and
having decided to study for holy orders, became a teacher.
Migrating in 1858 to Victoria, he was appointed to the office of
reader in the parish of St. Peter's, Melbourne, and as the result
of his studies gained an exhibition worth £100 a year to Moor
College, Sydney. After completing his course there, he was ordained
deacon by Bishop Perry in Melbourne in 1860, and was
appointed to the curacy of Christ Church, Ballarat, which he held
till 1862, in which year he took priest's orders. On March 7th,
1863, he married Annie Macdonald, eldest daughter of John Wright,
of Hobart. The same year he was appointed incumbent of St. Mary's,
Caulfield, near Melbourne. This preferment he held till 1864. Mr.
Watson was incumbent of Tarradale and Malmesbury, in Victoria, from
the latter year till 1867, subsequently of Inglewood and
Tarnagulla, and of Christ Church, Kilmore, from 1870 to 1873. In
the latter year he removed to New Zealand, where he became
incumbent of St. John's, Christchurch, a position he still holds.
In 1885-6, whilst on a visit to England, Mr. Watson acted as
deputational secretary for the Society for the Propagation of the
Gospel, and again in 1889-90. Mr. Watson has published "Adventures
in New Guinea" (1875); "Erchomenon; or, Republic of Materialism"
(Sampson Low, 1879); "The Decline and Fall of the British Empire;
or, The Witches' Cavern" (Treschler, 1890).</p>

his native town. He emigrated to the colony of New South Wales
early in life, and engaged in mercantile pursuits, becoming a
partner in the firm of John Frazer &amp; Co., of Sydney. He was
returned to the Assembly for the Lachlan district in 1869, and
subsequently represented Young. Mr. Watson was Colonial Treasurer
in the Parkes Administration from Dec. 1878 to Jan. 1883, and in
Feb. 1887 was called to the Legislative Council. Mr. Watson married
on April 8th, 1871, Miss Margaret Salmon Ewan.</p>

appointed a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales in
June 1861, but resigned on leaving for England in March 1866. He
was reappointed in Oct. 1874. In 1877 he presented the sum of £1000
to the University of Sydney to found an exhibition for students
from primary schools. In April 1890 his seat in the Legislative
Council became vacant owing to prolonged absence in England.</p>

of the Australasian, was born in Haddingtonshire (East
Lothian) in 1845, being the youngest son of James Watterston, of
Balgone Barns. The family, after spending a year in Gottland, in
the Baltic Sea, went to Australia, arriving in April 1853. After
acting as clerk in an attorney's office in Melbourne, Mr.
Watterston removed to Queensland in May 1860, and in October of the
same year, commenced his connection with the press. He learned
reporting on the Ipswich Herald (afterwards
the Queensland Times) under Mr. Hall, who set him in the way
of studying shorthand. From Ipswich he went to Brisbane in 1865, to
undertake parliamentary reporting. He was several years in the
gallery for the Brisbane Courier and next on
the Guardian, from which paper, in June 1869, he obtained
promotion to the parliamentary staff of the Argus, Melbourne,
returning to Victoria after nine years' absence. Mr. Watterston
executed various special commissions for the Argus, being sent
to the United States in 1876, for six months, in connection with
the Philadelphia Exhibition. He went to England in 1879, to report
on the movements of the Berry-Pearson embassy. Mr. Watterston was
appointed chief of the Argus reporting staff in 1881, and
four years later, on the editorship of
the Australasian becoming vacant, he had that position
given to him, the Australasian being a weekly literary,
sporting and agricultural journal, started by the proprietors of
the Argus in 1864.</p>

and educated at Kingswood School,and Queen's College, Taunton. He
graduated at the London University in 1870; and took his M.A.
degree in 1873. He was Classical Lecturer at Queen's College,
Taunton, from 1873 to 1875, when he was appointed vice-headmaster
of Kingswood School He was elected to the headmastership of Wesley
College, Melbourne, in 1881, and arrived in Victoria in February of
the following year. Mr. Way published, "The Odes of Horace,
literally translated in Metre" in 1875; "The Odyssey of Homer done
into English Verse" (by Avia), in 1880; and in 1885 appeared the
first part of his "Homer's Iliad in English Verse" (Books 1 to 6),
followed by Books 7 to 11 in 1886, and Books 12 and 13 in 1888.</p>

<p><a name="A1470" id="A1470"></a><b>Way, His Honour the Hon.
Samuel James</b>, Chief Justice and Lieut.-Governor of South
Australia, is the son of the late Rev. James Way, a Bible Christian
minister, who emigrated to South Australia in 1850, and became
general superintendent of the Bible Christian societies of
Australia. The Chief Justice was born at Portsmouth in April 1836,
and, after a private education at Shebbear and Maidstone, joined
his father in South Australia in March 1853. He was admitted to the
Colonial Bar in March 1861, and quickly took up a leading position
in his profession, being made Q.C. in Sept. 1871. Mr. Way was
elected a member of the Board of Education in Feb. 1874, and in
November of the same year a member of the council of the University
of Adelaide. Vice-Chancellor in succession to
Bishop Short in 1876, and Chancellor in 1883. It was not
till 1875 that Mr. Way participated actively in politics, and in
February of that year he was returned to the Legislative Assembly
for the Sturt district. In June 1875 he occupied the post of
Attorney-General in the Boucaut Ministry, but resigned it
in March 1871 on being appointed to succeed the late Sir R. D.
Hanson as Chief Justice of South Australia. Mr. Way has, it is
understood, on no less than three occasions declined the honour of
knighthood and has discharged the duties of administrator of the
government in the temporary absence of governors, and in the
interregna between the departure of one governor and the arrival of
his successor, nearly a dozen times; and it was therefore only a
fitting compliment which was conferred on him in 1890, when he was
appointed the first Lieutenant-Governor of the colony.</p>

Lincoln's Inn in May 1847. A year later he emigrated to South
Australia, and practised at the local Bar, being made Q.C., and
subsequently Crown Solicitor. In 1867 he was appointed Third Judge
of the Supreme Court of South Australia. He was drowned in the
wreck of the Gothenburg on the Barrier Reef, Torres

<p><a name="A1473" id="A1473"></a><b>Webb, His Honour George Henry
Frederick</b>, late Puisne Judge, Victoria, was the son of a naval
officer who took part in the battle of Trafalgar, and was born
about 1827. As a youth he entered the office of Mr. Gurney, the
famous parliamentary shorthand writer, and soon became proficient
in stenography. Mr. Webb emigrated to Melbourne, Victoria, in 1852,
and was for some time a reporter on the Argus. In 1855 he was
appointed shorthand writer to the Government of Victoria. Having
decided to embrace the legal profession, he attended the lectures
on law given at the University of Melbourne by Mr. H. S. Chapman
and Mr. Wilberforce Stephen and subsequently read in the latter's
chambers. In 1860 Mr. Webb was called to the Victorian Bar and
appointed a lecturer on law at the University of Melbourne. The
latter appointment he quickly resigned, as also the position of
Government shorthand writer in 1866. Having for a long period been
recognised as the leader of the Equity Bar in Victoria, he was in
1874 offered the puisne judgeship rendered vacant by the death of
Mr. Justice Williams, father of the present judge of that name. He
was, however, indisposed to make the pecuniary sacrifice which
acceptance would have necessitated. Having become Q.C. and
continued to practise with unrivalled success, he was elevated to
the Bench in May 1886 in place of the late Sir Robert
Molesworth, and fulfilled his judicial functions down to the time
of his death. Though on several occasions a candidate, he never
succeeded in securing his return to the Legislative Assembly, and
was also defeated when he contested a seat in the Legislative
Council. The late judge, who was a member of the Congregational
body, died at his residence, Caulfield, near Melbourne, on Sept.
26th, 1891, at the age of sixty-four.</p>

first collector of customs at Port Phillip, by his wife Ann,
daughter of Lieutenant Fisher, R.N., was born on Jan. 22nd, 1845,
at Newtown (now called Fitzroy), Melbourne. Mr. Webb was educated
at the Church of England Grammar School, Melbourne, and King's
College, London, and graduated B.A. at Melbourne University in
1867. He entered at Lincoln's Inn in November of that year, and was
called to the Bar in June 1870, having won the Inns of Court
Exhibition in Constitutional Law and Legal History in the previous
year. Mr. Webb was admitted to the Victorian Bar in 1872, and
practised on the equity side of the Supreme Court until 1884, when
he was appointed assistant chief clerk under the Judicature Act,
the rules of which he assisted in drafting. In Oct. 1884 he
succeeded Mr. Wilkinson as Master in Equity and Master in Lunacy,
which offices he still holds. He acted as Deputy Commissioner of
Titles during Mr. Bunny's illness, and in 1885, on Mr. Bunny's
death, he was Commissioner of Titles for some months concurrently
with his other offices. In March 1890 he inaugurated the new
procedure in and reorganised the Patents Office, and in March 1891
he also undertook the cognate subject of trademarks under the new
legislation then introduced. Mr. Webb published in 1872 a
successful work on the Imperial law in force in the colony. Two
years later he assisted Mr. J. B. Box in preparing and editing the
"Collection of Victorian Statutes," and in 1884 he himself prepared
and edited a supplementary volume. Mr. Webb was Dr. Ream's
principal assistant in the preparation of the former's monumental

After being for four years curate of Chiswick, Dr. Webber in 1864
became vicar of St. John the Evangelist, Holborn, a position which
he retained till his appointment to the bishopric of Brisbane in
1885. As vicar of St. John's Dr. Webber displayed exceptional
powers of organisation, the schools, guilds and other societies in
connection with his Church being regarded as a model throughout
London. He was also connected with the administration of some of
the leading Metropolitan Charitable and Educational Agencies, being
for twenty years a member of the Council of the Working Men's Club
and Institute Union, Vice-President of the National Association for
Promoting State-directed Emigration, from 1873 to 1875; Chairman of
the Finance and Reference Committee of the Girls' Friendly Society
from 1881 to 1885; and was a member of the London School Board
representing the district of Finsbury from 1882 to 1885. Having
been for twenty-one years one of the most useful and energetic
clergymen in London, Dr. Webber was appointed to succeed
Dr. Hale as Bishop of Brisbane, and was consecrated in
St. Paul's Cathedral by the Archbishop of Canterbury on St.
Barnabas Day 1885. He attended the Pan-Anglican Synod held at

year.</p>

<p><a name="A1476" id="A1476"></a><b>Wedge, Hon. John Helder</b>,
M.L.C., was born in England in 1792. He arrived in Tasmania in
1824, having received an appointment in the Survey Department of
that colony. In 1828 Mr. Wedge made three exploring journeys from
Circular Head into the north-west portion of the island, having
been instructed by the Government to report on the discoveries of
the Van Diemen's Land Company's surveyors, Messrs.
Goldie, Fossy, and Hellyer. On his return he strongly urged on
the Government the reservation of a township and area at Emu Bay,
but, unfortunately for the colony, his advice was not taken, and
the land was granted to the Van Diemen's Land Company. Some years
later, with Mr. Frankland, the Surveyor-General, he explored the
country from the head waters of the Derwent to Port Davey, tracing
the Huon River from its source. In 1835 he went to Port Phillip as
agent for a syndicate of fifteen Tasmanians, including Batman, J.
T. Gellibrand and himself, to take up a large tract of land, and
600,000 acres were purchased from the blacks before the party led
by J. P. Fawkner arrived. The land purchased extended
from the mouth of the river Yarra to three miles above the first
fall, thence fifty miles in a north-west line, thence fifty miles
in a westerly line, thence eighty miles to the Barwon River at
Geelong, and thence along the shore of Port Phillip Bay to the
point of commencement at the mouth of the Yarra Yarra River. The
purchase was disallowed by the Sydney Government, though at a later
period a grant of land was given to the company as compensation,
Mr. Wedge selling his share in 1854 for £18,000. After the collapse
of the company he went to England, returning to Tasmania with
Bishop Nixon in 1843, when he accepted the post of
manager of the Christ College estate at Bishopsbourne. In 1855 he
was elected member of the old Legislative Council for the district
of Morven, and on the introduction of free institutions in 1856 was
elected member for the new Legislative Council for the district of
North Esk. He was a member without office of the
short-lived Gregson Ministry from Feb. 26th to April
25th, 1857. At a later date he represented Hobart, and afterwards
the Huon, in the Legislative Council, retaining his seat until his
death. He resided for many years on his estate of Leighlands, near
Perth, but in 1865 removed to the estate of Medlands, on the river
Forth, where he died on Nov. 22nd, 1872, at the age of eighty.</p>

Colonial Treasurer in the second Cowper Government from
April to Oct. 1859, in the first Robertson Ministry from
March 1860 to Jan. 1861, and in the third Cowper Cabinet, in which
the latter was merged, from March 1860 to March 1863. Mr. Weekes

<p><a name="A1478" id="A1478"></a><b>Weld, Sir Frederick
Aloysius</b>, G.C.M.G., sometime Governor of Western Australia and
Tasmania, third son of Humphrey Weld, of Chideock Manor, Dorset, by
his marriage with the Hon. Christina Maria, daughter of Charles,
7th Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, and nephew of Cardinal Weld, of
Lulworth Castle, was born on May 9th, 1823, and educated at
Stonyhurst College and at Freiburg in Switzerland. Having decided
to embrace a colonial career, he emigrated to New Zealand in 1844,
and embarked in pastoral pursuits, engaging meantime in much
adventurous exploring work. Four years after his arrival in the
colony Sir George Grey offered Mr. Weld a seat in the then wholly
nominee Legislature. This, however, he declined, and took an active
part in the agitation for representative institutions. As soon as
these were conceded Mr. Weld was elected to the House of
Representatives. In 1854 he was made a member of the Executive
Council as one of the first inchoate Government which preceded the
first responsible ministry, and from Nov. 1860 was Minister for
Native Affairs in the first Stafford Ministry until their defeat in
July 1861. In Nov. 1864 Mr. Weld became Premier of New Zealand,
holding during the greater part of his bare year of office the
portfolio of Chief Secretary. Prior to the formation of his
Ministry he put forward, as the basis of his policy, the immediate
withdrawal of all the Imperial troops and the future conduct of the
war by the colonists themselves, with the aid of the friendly
tribes. This policy proved as successful as it was bold, and
secured, not only the approval of the Governor and local
legislature, but of the Imperial Government and Parliament. When
Mr. Weld came into office on this epoch-making occasion, the
country was in a state of war; the general of the army and the
Governor of the colony were at variance; escaped Maori prisoners
held a fortified position within sight of the capital; Government
debentures were unsaleable, and the banks refused advances, whilst
the colony was exposed to what seemed a ruinous military
expenditure, over which they virtually exercised no control In the
face of these troubles the Fox-Whittaker Government had
resigned without meeting Parliament. Mr. Weld proposed to carry on
the war by small bodies of trained bushmen, relying much on the
effect of pushing roads through the disturbed country. On these
lines he succeeded in turning back the tide of war. He advised and
carried out the confiscation of the lands of the Waikato tribe, as
a mark of its defeat; and it has never since taken up arms. He also
sent an expedition of colonial troops to punish the murderers of
the Rev. Mr. Volkner. His administration not only dealt some
effective strokes in war, but took measures for the establishment
of peace. They opened Native Land Courts, carried the Native Rights
Bill (introduced by Mr. Fitzgerald, the Minister for Native
Affairs), and raised the question of native representation. To
secure the unity of the colony, they brought about the removal of
the capital to Wellington, the site impartially selected by
Commissioners from the Australian colonies. The credit of the
colony was restored; the finances, in the hands of Mr. (now Sir)
William Fitzherbert, the Treasurer, were placed on a better
footing; the Panama line was subsidised; an electric telegraph
cable was ordered so as to connect the two islands of New Zealand,
and a scientific department was established under Dr. (now
Sir) James Hector. In Oct. 1865 the Weld Government was
defeated on a vote for defence purposes, and resigned, Mr. Weld,
whose health had broken down going to England for rest and change.
Such was the repute which his successful rule had gained him with
the Imperial authorities, that soon after his arrival there the
Duke of Buckingham, then Secretary of State for the Colonies,
expressed his intention of offering him a Colonial Governorship. A
change of Ministry took place; and Earl Granville carried out the
intention of his predecessor, by appointing him Governor of Western
Australia. Under Mr. Weld's administration various industries
were developed; a partially representative legislature was
established; municipal institutions were introduced; an Education
Act was passed, which gave general satisfaction; a system was
adopted which placed all religious denominations on a footing of
equality, grants of land being made by the Governor to all of them
in proportion to their number, for churches, schools, glebes and
charitable institutions; telegraph lines were constructed
throughout the colony; steam communication was opened up along the
coasts, so as to promote the settlement of various parts of the
territory; and important explorations were successfully carried out
by the present Premier of the colony, Sir John Forrest. Two of
Mr. Weld's last acts as Governor of Western Australia were to cut
the first sod of the first Government railway, and to plant the
first telegraph post of a line which ultimately connected Western
Australia with Adelaide and the whole of Eastern Australia. In Jan.
1875 Mr. Weld, who held office in Western Australia from Sept. 1869
to Dec. 1874, was appointed Governor of Tasmania, where he remained
till April 1880, when he was knighted and appointed Governor of the
Straits Settlements, a position which he held till 1887, when he
retired from the colonial service on a pension. Sir Frederick, who
was created C.M.G. in 1875, K.C.M.G. in 1880, and G.C.M.G. in 1885,
married on March 2nd, 1858, Filomena Mary Anne, eldest daughter of
the late Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps de Lisle, of Grace Dieu
Manor and Garenden Park, Leicester. Accounts of his explorations of
the uninhabited districts of the Middle Island of New Zealand
appeared in the New Zealand Government Gazette in 1851, and
Province of Nelson in 1855. He is author of "Hints to Intending
Sheep Farmers in New Zealand," and of a paper on the great volcanic
eruption of Manna Loa (Sandwich Islands) in 1855; and ascent of
that mountain (journal of the Royal Geological Society, London,
1856); also "Notes on New Zealand Affairs" (London, 1869). He died
in England on July 20th, 1891.</p>

<p><a name="A1479" id="A1479"></a><b>Wentworth, William
Charles</b>, the great Australian patriot, was of Irish extraction,
being the son of Darcy Wentworth, a  surgeon from Dublin, who
was appointed Imperial Medical Officer at Norfolk Island, where the
subject of this notice was born in Oct. 1793. His mother's maiden
name was Catherine Parry. When seven years old he was sent to
England, and educated under Dr. Alexander Crombie, of Greenwich.
After his return to Sydney (where his father became Principal
Superintendent of Police) he joined with Messrs. Blaxland and
Lawson in an attempt to cross the Blue Mountains, which had
hitherto barred the way into the interior. The party started on May
11th, 1813, crossed the Nepean, and after undergoing great
hardships returned successful on June 6th. In 1816 Mr. Wentworth
revisited England, and went through the usual curriculum at
Cambridge University. In 1819 he published his maiden work, "A
Statistical, Historical and Political Description of the Colony of
New South Wales," which went through three editions prior to 1824.
At the annual commencement at Cambridge University in 1823,
Wentworth competed against the well-known poet, Winthrop
Mackworth Praed, and twenty-five others for the Chancellor's medal
for a poem on "Australasia." The palm was awarded to Praed, and
Wentworth was placed second; but it is generally considered as a
matter of literary judgment that the order should have been
reversed. The curious on such matters will find the two poems
printed in extenso in Mr. Henniker Heaton's
"Australian Dictionary of Dates." Having been called to the Bar in
1822, Mr. Wentworth returned to Sydney, where he was admitted to
the colonial Bar in 1824. Besides practising his profession with
great success, he went largely into squatting, and in conjunction
with his friend, Dr. Wardell, started
the Australian newspaper, the plant for which they had
brought from England. Having established his repute as a writer and
speaker, Mr. Wentworth became the head and front of the Patriotic
Association, which was formed to promote the claims of the people
of New South Wales to civil and political privileges similar to
those enjoyed by other British subjects. In the famous Sudds and
Thompson case, in which two soldiers committed theft in order to
secure the milder treatment accorded to convicts, and were so
severely punished that the former died under the infliction,
Wentworth made himself the exponent of popular indignation, and in
a pamphlet which he published in 1826, under the title of "The
Impeachment," asserted his intention of pursuing
Governor Darling to the gallows. A native of the colony,
endowed with great gifts of speech and statesmanship, and fearless
in his championship of what be believed to be just, Mr. Wentworth
became the idol of the reaction against the spirit of military
despotism which then pervaded the Government. The boasted palladium
of the British constitution was withdrawn after a brief and partial
trial in New South Wales, an Act which came into force in March
1829, placing the liberty and property of the Colonists in the
hands, not of their fellow-citizens, but of a biassed and narrow
class of military jurors. At a public meeting held in Sydney in
1830, to congratulate William IV. on his accession, Mr. Wentworth
carried an amendment to the stereotyped form of address drawn up by
the loyal promoters, calling for the extension "to the only colony
of Britain bereft of the rights of Britons of a full participation
of the benefits and privileges of the British Constitution." Though
generally magnanimous and much beloved in his private capacity, Mr.
Wentworth was not superior to the greed for territorial
acquisition, which is the besetting vice of colonising pioneers,
and which where it has succeeded not only victimises the natives,
but inflicts a grievous wrong on future generations of industrial
European immigrants. Public sentiment must therefore approve of Sir
George Gipps' action in disallowing the bargain by which Mr.
Wentworth had secured the whole of the Middle Island of New Zealand
(including what are now the Otago, Southland, Canterbury, Nelson
and Marlborough districts), together with some 200,000 acres in the
North Island, for a paltry payment of £400 in cash and some small
prospective annuities to the infatuated chiefs who were thus
willing to fritter away their birthright for a mess of pottage. In
the year 1843 the colony obtained a measure of the political rights
for which Mr. Wentworth and his coadjutors had so long contended&mdash;a
new Legislative Council with a partially representative element
being constituted. Mr. Wentworth was at once elected for the city
of Sydney, along with his friend Dr. Bland, the secretary of
the Patriotic Association. As one by one the objects for which he
had fought were conceded, Mr. Wentworth's liberalism began to pale,
and ultimately to assume a decidedly conservative hue. Even on the
great question of the renewal of transportation he did not take the
popular view, which was championed with great ability by
Mr. Lowe (now Lord Sherbrooke), who at the general
election in 1848 was returned for the city of Sydney in the place
of Dr. Bland, on whose behalf Mr. Wentworth made an eloquent
appeal. Such was the esteem and gratitude with which the latter was
still justly regarded, that no attempt was made to assail his seat,
and he was returned at the head of the poll; but the defeat of his
old and tried friend, Dr. Bland, in which Mr. (now Sir) Henry
Parkes assisted, was nevertheless a severe blow to him.
Besides being the father of the present political constitution of
New South Wales, Mr. Wentworth was the founder of the Sydney
University. Taking up the subject in 1849, he succeeded in passing
the measure which constituted the University in 1850, and it was
opened two years later. One other great service he was still to do
his native land. In 1854 he carried the new Constitution Bill
through the Council, and was deputed to go to England in
conjunction with the Colonial Secretary, Mr. (afterwards
Sir) Edward Deas Thomson, to advocate the measure before the
Imperial Parliament. Their mission was completely successful, and
the new Constitution came into force in 1856. Mr. Wentworth's
waning liberalism was well illustrated by the proposal which he put
forth in 1853, but subsequently abandoned owing to the popular
distaste and ridicule with which it was received, for the
establishment of a Colonial House of Lords on the hereditary basis.
He was also strongly opposed to the legislation by which the
Constitution Act was subsequently liberalised in its electoral
arrangements. Despite this, when Mr. Wentworth returned to Sydney
in 1861, his splendid public services were recognised by a
demonstration in which nothing was wanting that cordiality and
enthusiasm could supply. On the invitation of
the Cowper Government, he agreed to become President
of the reconstituted Upper Chamber, in succession to
Sir William Westbrooke Burton, whose secession with the
majority of the members as a protest against ministerial coercion
is a matter of history. Mr. Wentworth held this position from June
1861 to Oct. 1862, when he once more returned to England, where he
resided until his death, which took place at Marleigh House,
Wimborne, Dorsetshire, on March 20th, 1872. By his express
directions his remains were taken to Sydney and interred at
Vaucluse, the New South Wales Parliament voting the great patriot
the last tribute of a public funeral in the land of his birth and
of his splendid achievements as a publicist. Mr. Wentworth in his
lifetime refused knighthood, and the civic honours thus conferred
were alone suitable to commemorate his obsequies, being the only
species of distinction he had ever sought. Mr. Wentworth was the
chairman of the committee which reported in favour of constituting
the University of Sydney, the projector of the institution, and the
author of the document in which the scheme for its formation was
embodied, as well as the prime mover in the legislation which
provided for its establishment, and one of the first members of the
Senate. The gift of £2000 by his son, Mr. Fitzwilliam Wentworth in
1876, to found two bursaries in his father's honour, was thus felt
to have peculiar fitness. Mr. Wentworth was married in Sydney in
Oct. 1829 to Sarah, daughter of Francis Cox, who died in 1880.</p>

<p><a name="A1480" id="A1480"></a><b>Were, Jonathan Binns</b>,
C.M.G., J.P. Victoria, was the third son of the late Nicholas Were,
of Landcox, Somerset, and was born at Wellington, in that county,
on April 25th, 1809. Mr. Were engaged in mercantile pursuits, and
left Plymouth for Port Phillip in July 1839, ultimately
establishing himself as a merchant in Melbourne. In 1852 he
unsuccessfully contested South Bourke for a seat in the old
Legislative Council, the late Mr. Henry Miller defeating
him. Four years later Mr. Were was returned to the Legislative
Assembly for Brighton, in opposition to Mr. John Dennistoun
Wood. He, however, resigned in March 1857, and never re-entered
political life. Mr. Were, who was consul in Melbourne for several
foreign nations, was the first chairman of the Melbourne Chamber of
Commerce in 1841, and, was re-elected in 1852. In 1881 he was
created C.M.G. in recognition of his services in connection with
the Melbourne Exhibition of the previous year. He died
on Sept. 6th, 1885.</p>

<p><a name="A1481" id="A1481"></a><b>West, Rev. John</b>, was born
in 1808, and emigrated to Tasmania in 1839, where he
officiated as an Independent minister at Launceston for sixteen
years. He was the head and front of the Anti-Transportation
movement, and originated the League which the determination of Lord
Grey to resume the despatch of convicts called into being. In 1851
he and Mr. Weston attended the great conference held in Melbourne,
at which the representatives of the various Australian colonies
entered into a solemn engagement to resist the influx of European
criminals by every means in their power. The death-blow was thus
given to the system. Mr. West removed to New South Wales in Nov.
1855, and joined the Sydney Morning Herald as chief of
their literary staff, and continued to be editor until his death,
on Dec. 11th, 1873. Mr. West was the author of the "History of
Tasmania," published at Launceston in two volumes in 1852.</p>

M.A., Rector of Delgany, Ireland, by his marriage with Elmina,
eldest surviving daughter and co-heir of Alexander Erskine, of
Bulhall, county Forfar, and Longhaven, county Aberdeen, was born on
Sept. 12th, 1839, at Anamoe, county Wicklow, Ireland, and was
educated at Christ Church College, Oxford. Having emigrated to
South Australia, he was member for Mount Barker in the Legislative
Assembly of that colony from 1872 to 1875 and for Encounter Bay
from 1878 to 1881. Mr. West-Erskine, who was Minister of Public
Works in the Boucaut Government from June 1875 to Feb.
1876, was elected to the Legislative Council of South Australia in
May 1885, but retired in 1891, when he returned to England. In 1872
he assumed the name of Erskine, by royal licence, in addition to
his patronymic.</p>

<p><a name="A1483" id="A1483"></a><b>Westgarth, William</b>, the
Australian financier, was the son of John Westgarth,
Surveyor-General of Customs in Scotland, and was born in 1815. He
emigrated to Melbourne in the early days of what was then the Port
Phillip settlement, leaving Leith in a sailing ship in July
1840. In Sept. 1845 he was nominated one of a committee appointed
at a great public meeting in Melbourne to frame a petition to the
Imperial Parliament protesting against the credit of the Port
Phillip district being pledged jointly with that of New South Wales
for an immigration loan for the latter colony. Mr. Westgarth took a
very prominent part in the movement for obtaining the separation of
Port Phillip from New South Wales, and was also one of the leading
opponents of the admission of convicts into Australia. In the
latter connection he was a party to the "League and Solemn
Engagement of the Australasian Colonies" declared by the delegates
at the conference held in Melbourne in Jan. 1851, and subscribed a
hundred guineas towards the funds of the League. In the same year
Mr. Westgarth was elected to represent Melbourne in the then only
partially elective Legislative Council which was established after
separation from New South Wales had been achieved, and the colony
of Victoria constituted. In May 1851 the discovery of gold at
Bathurst in New South Wales was made public, and greatly depressed
the inhabitants of Melbourne, who feared that population would
leave them for the El Dorados of the mother colony. Accordingly a
public meeting was convened on June 9th, and it was determined to
offer a reward to any person who should disclose to a committee, of
which Mr. Westgarth was a member, a gold mine capable of being
profitably worked within two hundred miles of the city of
Melbourne. The discovery of gold in Victoria very shortly
afterwards followed. In April 1852 Mr. Westgarth was one of the
speakers at a great meeting held in Melbourne "to protest against
the inundation of the Australian colonies with British felonry
through the medium of Van Diemen's Land." He was also one of the
promoters of the Act passed by the Legislative Council in this
session for the prevention of convict immigration into Victoria,
and took a prominent part in the agitation which followed on the
arrival of a despatch from the Colonial Office two years later
declaring the prevention act an invasion of the Queen's
prerogative, and instructing the Governor to release any criminals
who had been imprisoned under the Act. In 1854, when the trouble
arose over the diggers' licences, Mr. Westgarth was nominated at a
public meeting to be one of a commission to mediate between the
Government and the diggers. He was subsequently chairman of the
commission appointed by the Governor to inquire into the goldfields
grievances. In the meantime Mr. Westgarth paid several visits to
England, and finally left Victoria to settle in London in Feb.
1857. His subsequent career as head of the eminent financial firm
of William Westgarth &amp; Co., of Finch Lane, is well known to
those interested in the issue and success of the various
Australasian loans. Mr. Westgarth revisited Australia in 1888, and
died in London on Oct. 28th, 1889. Mr. Westgarth, whilst mainly
interested in financial topics affecting the progress of the
Australian colonies, was the author of a scheme for promoting the
better housing and the improvement of the condition generally of
the poorer classes of London. He did not, however, live to see it
initiated. Mr. Westgarth was the author of the following works: "A
Report on the Position, Capabilities, and Prospects of the
Australian Aborigines" (1846); "Victoria, late Australia Felix, or
Port Phillip District of New South Wales" (Edinburgh, 1853);
"Victoria and the Australian Gold Mines in 1857" (London, 1857);
"Personal Recollections of Early Melbourne and Victoria"
(Melbourne, 1888); "Half a Century of Australasian Progress: a
Personal Retrospect" (London, 1889). He also edited in 1886 a
volume of essays on the sanitation of London and the dwellings of
the poorer classes.</p>

<p><a name="A1484" id="A1484"></a><b>Weston, Hon. William
Pritchard</b>, sometime Premier of Tasmania, son of a London
physician, was born in London in 1804. Soon after 1830 he emigrated
to Tasmania, and took up a grant of land at Ringwood, Cressy, in
the north of the island. He was for many years a leading magistrate
and property owner of the colony, and took a prominent part in the
Anti-Transportation League, which was formed to resist Earl Grey's
expressed intention to resume the despatch of convicts to the
island. In 1851 he was associated with the Rev. John
West as the delegate of the Tasmanian League at the great
Melbourne Conference, held in February, when "The League and Solemn
Engagement of the Australasian Colonies" was adopted, pledging
the latter never to employ convicts as servants, and to resist
their importation by all constitutional means. He again represented
Tasmania as delegate at the Anti-Transportation Conference of the
United Colonies held in Sydney in April 1851. In 1856 Mr. Weston
was returned to the first House of Assembly for the Kingwood
district. Having been the mover of the vote of want of confidence
carried against the Gregson Ministry in April 1857, Mr.
Weston was called upon to form an Administration, in which he acted
as Premier without office for about three weeks, when he resigned
the leadership of the Government to Mr. (now Sir) Francis Smith,
but still held office without portfolio as a member of the
Executive Council. Sir Francis having accepted the office of Chief
Justice, Mr. Weston again resumed the premiership in Nov. 1860, but
resigned in July 1861. He died on Feb. 21st, 1888, at St. Kilda,
Vict., where he had resided for a number of years prior to his
death.</p>

<p><a name="A1485" id="A1485"></a><b>Wheeler, Hon. James Henry</b>,
M.L.A., Minister of Railways, Victoria, who was born in Derbyshire,
and went to Victoria in 1854, is an extensive sawmill owner in the
Wombat State Forest. He was elected to the Assembly for the
Creswick district in 1864 as a moderate constitutionalist, but
retired from Parliament in 1867. In 1880, however, he was
re-elected, and represented the constituency till 1889, when he was
returned for the Daylesford subdivision. In Nov. 1890, on the
formation of the Munro Ministry, he accepted the post of Minister
of Railways, which he continued to hold when in Feb. 1892 the
Ministry was reconstructed under Mr. Shiels.</p>

<p><a name="A1486" id="A1486"></a><b>Whitaker, Hon. Sir
Frederick</b>, K.C.M.G., M.L.C., sometime Premier of New Zealand,
was the eldest son of Frederick Whitaker, J.P. and D.L., and was
born in 1812, at Bampton, Oxfordshire, England. Early in 1889 he
was admitted to practise as a solicitor and attorney in England,
and towards the close of the same year he left for Australia,
landing in Sydney in 1840. Staying but a short time in New South
Wales, he went to New Zealand, settling at Kororarika, then the
seat of government, where he entered on the practice of his
profession, which he continued till the removal of the seat of
government to Auckland in 1841, when he removed to that city. In
the year 1842 he was appointed county court judge, the court having
civil and criminal jurisdiction, like the present district courts.
In 1844 the county court was abolished, and a Court of Requests
substituted. In the following year Mr. Whitaker was appointed
senior non-official member of the Legislative Council, and sat in
the last council held by Governor Fitzroy, and also in the
first council held by his successor, Governor Grey. The
Northern insurrection breaking out, Mr. Whitaker served in the New
Zealand Militia, in which force he held a major's commission; and
he was engaged in garrison duty in Auckland when the rebellious
Northern natives threatened destruction to the infant settlement.
In the year 1851 the Provincial Legislative Council was
established, one-third of whose members were nominated, and the
remaining two-thirds elected. Mr. Whitaker was one of the
representatives elected for Auckland city, but the Council was
never called together. The passing of the New Zealand Constitution
Act in 1852 by the English Parliament and the inauguration of
popular representative institutions in the colony in 1853 again
brought him to the front in political life. He was elected a member
of the Provincial Council, and sat in several sessions. During the
superintendency of General Wynyard he acted as Provincial
Law Adviser, and as a member of the Provincial Executive. In 1853
he was called to the Legislative Council of New Zealand, and in the
following year attended the first session of the General Assembly.
In 1855 he succeeded Mr. Swainson as Attorney-General,
under the lieutenant-governorship of General Wynyard. In the same
year he was Speaker of the Legislative Council; but in May 1856 he
resigned the post of Speaker to accept the portfolio of
Attorney-General in the Bell-Sewell Ministry, which was ejected
from office within a fortnight. Mr. Fox, who formed the succeeding
administration, was in turn supplanted within a like period by
Mr. Stafford; and Mr. Whitaker again resumed his portfolio,
with the leadership of the Legislative Council. On July 12th, 1861,
the Stafford Ministry was defeated on the question of native
affairs, and more especially on the Taranaki war of 1860 and
the Waitara question, by Mr. Fox, the leader of the so-called
Philo-Maori party. Mr. Whitaker then resigned his seat in the
Legislative Council, and entered into partnership with Mr. Thomas
Russell, under the style of Whitaker &amp; Russell, and carried on
an extensive legal business. In Jan. 1863 Mr. Whitaker was again
appointed Attorney-General, but declined the proffered
accompaniment of a seat in Mr. Domett's Ministry. On the formation
of the third Fox Ministry, in Oct. of the same year, he accepted,
at the request of Mr. Fox, the offices of Premier and
Attorney-General, with a seat in the Legislative Council. In Nov.
1864 the members of the Fox-Whitaker Ministry tendered their
resignation, owing to the differences of opinion which arose
between them and the Governor, Sir George Grey, relative to the
conduct of the Waikato war and the confiscation of lands of natives
in rebellion. Mr. Whitaker at this period resigned his seat in the
Legislative Council. In 1865 he was elected Superintendent of
Auckland without opposition, and in the following month was
returned to the House of Representatives for Parnell. He became the
leader of the Auckland party. In 1867 he retired from the
superintendency and from his seat in the Assembly. At this time he
took an active interest in the development of the mining interest
at the Thomas goldfields; he was also largely interested in the
timber trade, and in extensive pastoral operations. In 1876 he
returned to the political arena, and was elected without opposition
for Waikato. On the retirement of Sir Julius Vogers second
administration in Sept. 1876, he accepted the office of
Attorney-General with Ministerial precedence in Major Atkinson's
administration, and with permission to reside in Auckland. In Sept.
1876 he accepted the additional portfolios of Postmaster-General
and Commissioner of Telegraphs. In Oct. 1877 the Atkinson
administration resigned on an adverse vote carried by Sir George
Grey. Parliament was dissolved shortly afterwards. On the formation
of the Hall Ministry in Oct. 1879, Mr. Whitaker was called to the
Upper House, proffered his old portfolio as Attorney-General, and
undertook the conduct of Government business in the Legislative
Council. On the resignation of Sir John Hall, owing to ill-health,
in April 1882, Mr. Whitaker became Premier, which position he
resigned in Sept. 1883, in consequence of his private affairs
requiring his presence in Auckland. In Feb. 1884 he was appointed
K.C.M.G. by her Majesty. Sir Frederick was one of the founders, and
for many years a director, of the Bank of New Zealand. He was
Attorney-General in the last Atkinson administration from Oct. 1887
to Dec. 1890, when he retired with his colleagues. Sir Frederick,
who died in Dec. 1891, married in 1843 Augusta, stepdaughter of
Alexander Shepherd, Colonial Treasurer of New Zealand, who died in
1884.</p>

<p><a name="A1487" id="A1487"></a><b>White, Hon. James</b>, M.L.C.,
one of the best-known patrons of the Australian turf, was the
eldest son of James White, one of the pioneer settlers of the
Hunter River district in New South Wales. He was born at Scone, in
that colony, in 1828. While he was still at school his father died,
and Mr. White at the age of sixteen was called upon to manage
extensive station properties, and gradually took up more and more
outlying country on his own account, until he became one of the
largest and most successful New South Wales squatters. He did a
fair share of work in pioneering country on the Barwon, Hunter, and
Castlereagh rivers, and was almost uniformly successful in his
enterprises. In 1869 Mr. White went to England, and remained away
several years, during which time he visited all the principal
cities of Europe. In 1866 he was elected to the Assembly for the
Upper Hunter, and kept that position for three years, and then
resigned upon going to Europe. He was nominated to the Upper House
in 1874. As a racing man, Mr. White was first known in connection
with a steeplechaser called Hotspur, who won the A.J.C.
Steeplechase in 1876. His first notable racehorse was Chester, who
was trained in conjunction with Roodee by Mr. E. de Mestre, and won
the double&mdash;Sydney Derby and Cup. Another of his horses, Democrat,
won the Sydney Cup and Metropolitan in 1878, and in the spring of
1879 Palmyra won Mr. White his first Maribyrnong Plate. In 1880
Sapphire won the Oaks, and The Pontiff the Metropolitan, and in
1883 Iolanthe won for him the Maribyrnong Plate,
and Martini-Henry carried off the double&mdash;Derby and Cup.
Finding that from failing health he could not stand the excitement
of a close attention to racing, Mr. White sold all his horses in
training and yearlings in April 1890, and they realised phenomenal
prices. Titan alone brought 4,000 guineas, the highest price ever
given for a yearling in the Colonies, and the total for thirteen
lots was 17,498 guineas. Mr. White continued his breeding
establishment at Kirkham, in New South Wales, with a view to racing
in England. He was the most successful racing man ever known in
Australia. During the thirteen years he was racing Mr. White took a
keen interest in everything pertaining to the welfare of the turf,
and his colours were always popular with the public, because every
one knew that once seen at the post they were there to try and win.
His colts Kirkham and Narellan were both entered for the English
Derby in 1890, but the latter was scratched, and the former failed
to secure a place. Mr. White died on July 12th, 1890.</p>

<p><a name="A1488" id="A1488"></a><b>White, John</b>, went to New
Zealand with his father and uncle (Rev. William White) when six
years of age, and resided at Hokianga. At a very early period he
interested himself deeply in acquiring a knowledge of the Maori
language, traditions, and customs. The sack of Kororarika by the
Maoris in 1844 compelled him and his family to remove to Auckland,
and he was appointed gold commissioner at Coromandel under the late
Major Heaphy, V.C. Soon afterwards Mr. White was appointed
interpreterand land purchaser under Surveyor-General Ligar, and
bought for the Government the district now known as Waitakera. He
also obtained from the natives a deed of gift of a strip of land
from the head of the Waitemata River to Helensville for the
construction of the present Helensville Railway. He succeeded in
extinguishing the native title to most of the lands in the vicinity
of Auckland. He was appointed magistrate of Central Wanganui, and
decided many native disputes. He was entrusted by the New Zealand
Government with the onerous task of writing a complete history of
the native race, embodying all the ancient mythology and religious
superstitions of the Maoris. Six volumes of this work entitled "The
Ancient History of the Maoris," were issued from the Government
press. Mr. White, who was regarded as having the most profound
knowledge of Maori matters of any man in New Zealand, was also the
author of "Te Rou; or, The Maori at Home," portraying native life
and customs in the pre-European days of New Zealand. He died at
Auckland' on Jan. 13th, 1891.</p>

<p><a name="A1488a" id="A1488a"></a><b>Whitehead, Charles</b>, was
born in London in 1804. His first volume, "The Solitary," a poem in
three parts, was published in 1831 by Effingham Wilson, then
Tennyson's publisher. This was followed by a work of a totally
different kind, whose title, "Lives and Exploits of English
Highwaymen, Pirates, and Robbers," sufficiently indicates its scope
and character. Mr. Whitehead next published a romance called "Jack
Ketch." More notable in the history of literature than any of his
own achievements, however, was his recommendation of Dickens to
Chapman &amp; Hall, who wanted a ready writer of comic "copy" for
the artist Seymour's sketches. The commission was indeed offered to
Whitehead, who passed it on to his friend Boz; hence the existence
of "Pickwick." In 1836 Whitehead produced a play entitled&nbsp;The
Cavalier&nbsp;at the Haymarket Theatre, which had some measure of
success. His best work, "Richard Savage: a Romance," appeared
in&nbsp;Bentley's Miscellany&nbsp;(1841-2), and was most favourably
received by the critics. In 1843 he published "The Earl of Essex,"
a historical romance, and in 1847 "Smiles and Tears; or, The
Romance of Life," a novel in three volumes. In 1857 he and his wife
emigrated to Victoria, and in 1862 he died in great penury in the
Melbourne hospital. Although a casual worker on the local press,
Mr. Whitehead did no good work in the colony; and his literary
career may be said to have ended some years before he left England.
Mr. Whitehead was an intimate friend of&nbsp;Charles
Dickens,&nbsp;Douglas Jerrold, and other leading writers of the
time. His Life has been written by Mr. Mackenzie Bell, who,
however, does not record the fact that he was the uncle of the
well-known English actress Mrs. Bernard Beere, who has recently
been on a professional tour, and has been most warmly welcomed in
the city where her father's brother died so miserably. [This

<p><a name="A1490" id="A1490"></a><b>Whitmore, Major-General the
Hon. Sir George Stoddart</b>, K.C.M.G., M.L.C., commandant New
Zealand military forces, is the son of the late Major George St. V.
Whitmore, R.E., and Isabella his wife, daughter of Sir J. Stoddart,
Chief Justice of Malta. His grandfather, the late General Sir
George Whitmore, K.C.H., was colonel-commandant R.E. Sir George was
born at Malta on May 31st, 1830, and was educated at Edinburgh
Academy and at the Staff College. He entered the army in 1847 as
ensign in the Cape Mounted Rifles, and became lieutenant in May
1850, captain in July 1854, and brevet-major in June 1856. He
served with distinction in the Kaffir wars of 1847 and 1851-3, in
the Boer insurrection of 1848, and in the East with the Turkish
contingent in 1855-6. He has the fourth class of the Medjidie and
three medals. After exceptional services in the Crimea he went to
New Zealand as military secretary to Sir Duncan Cameron in 1861.
Resigning his position in the army in Dec. 1862, he became a
settler in the Hawke's Bay district, which has been his
headquarters to the present time. He was appointed to
command the Hawke's Bay Militia in 1866, when he successfully
led two hundred militia and volunteers at Omaranui, surrounded the
gathering Hau Haus, who threatened destruction to the. settlement
of Napier, and cut off or captured them almost to a man. In 1868 he
conducted a campaign against the celebrated Te Kooti, who had
just escaped from the Chatham Islands, and drove him and his
followers into hiding. A month later he was placed in command of
the West Coast force, which had met with some reverses, and had to
be recruited and reorganised. For some considerable time Te Kooti
kept the country in a state of alarm. His successes brought many
wild spirits to his standard, and he placed his fortress at
Ngatipa, a wooded mountain whose summit is about two thousand five
hundred feet above the level of the sea. It was said to be the
strongest fortified post in the North Island. The massacre at
Poverty Bay compelled the Government to send Colonel Whitmore to
reduce this stronghold. After a siege of five days the place was
taken on Jan. 3rd, 1869, and the enemy escaped with very severe
loss. Returning to the West Coast, he led the colonial troops
successfully from Kai Iwi to the Waitara, recovering all the
country that had been abandoned and defeating Titokowaru's band in
several engagements. Having completely pacified the West Coast, he
was sent to put down the insurrection in the Uriwera mountains,
where Te Kooti had once more raised a body of followers. This duty
had been scarcely accomplished when a change in the Ministry
occurred. Mr. Fox defeated Mr. Stafford, and at once
removed Colonel Whitmore from the command of the troops in the
field, just at the moment when complete success appeared close at
hand. Te Kooti, being unpursued, was able to recover from the
effects of defeat; and it was consequently eighteen months
afterwards before he was again reduced to the same straits. In Oct.
1877 Colonel Whitmore joined Sir G. Grey's Ministry as
Colonial Secretary and Defence Minister, retiring in Oct. 1879,
with the rest of his colleagues. In 1870 he was created C.M.G., and
in 1882 K.C.M.G. In 1863 he accepted a seat in the Legislative
Council, which he still holds. Sir George was a member of the
short-lived Stout-Vogel Cabinet in August 1884, as a
Minister without portfolio. The same combination coming back to
power in Sept. of the same year, he was appointed commandant of the
colonial forces and commissioner of the armed constabulary, with
the rank of major-general, conferred for the first time in New
Zealand on an officer of the colonial forces. Sir George married in
1865 Isabella, daughter of the late William Smith, of Roxeth, near
Rugby, England.</p>

<p><a name="A1492" id="A1492"></a><b>Whitton, John</b>, was born at
Wakefield, Yorkshire, in 1819. After many years' experience on the
English railways he was appointed, on the recommendation of the
President of the Board of Trade, Engineer-in-Chief of the New South
Wales railways in March 1856, and subsequently had sole charge of
the construction of railways, and also of railway surveys, in the
colony; and for many years he was also in charge of the locomotive
and permanent way branches. In 1890 Mr. Whitton retired, and was
allotted a special pension in view of his lengthened and
exceptional services. The amount was, however, considerably reduced
by the Assembly on account of its unprecedented nature, which, it
was feared, might give rise to similar claims in the case of other
officers in the future.</p>

<p><a name="A1493" id="A1493"></a><b>Whitworth, Robert Percy</b>,
was born in England in 1831. He landed in New South Wales in 1855,
and, after a varied experience, joined the reporting staff of the
Empire in Sydney. He was subsequently in Queensland, and in 1864
became connected with the Melbourne press. He wrote a successful
farce, entitled Catching a Conspirator, in 1867, and assisted
in compiling a series of colonial gazetteers.</p>

<p><a name="A1494" id="A1494"></a><b>Whyte, Hon. James</b>, who was
the last surviving member of the first wholly elective Legislative
Council of Tasmania, was the son of George Whyte, a captain in the
Yeomanry Cavalry, by his marriage with Miss Walker, cousin of
Thomas Pringle, the well-known South African explorer and poet
and Anti-Slavery Society secretary. He was born near Greenlaw,
Scotland, in March 1820, and arrived in Tasmania with his father in
1832. So far back as 1838, when the colony of Victoria was in its
infancy, and Mr.Whyte was only seventeen years of age, he crossed
the Straits, and, with a good stock of sheep, settled on the
station at Portland Bay known as Kononwotong. He and his brothers
traded on a large scale under the firm of Whyte Brothers, and were
the pioneers of the present township of Coleraine. The difficulties
with the savage aborigines were very great, and Mr. Whyte had his
vicissitudes, like all early settlers in squatting life. In
connection with Mr. Robert McDonald and Mr. William Lane, he
afterwards became the proprietor of a large station at Clunes, on
which at a subsequent date the Port Phillip Gold Mine was
discovered, which for years yielded a handsome royalty to its
owners. Mr. Whyte, satisfied with his handsome returns from the
Clunes goldmine, returned to Tasmania about the year 1853. His
means were ample, and in 1854 he made his first appearance on the
stage of public life, when, in the half-nominee and
half-representative Legislature of that day, he contested the seat
for Brighton with Dr. Butler, but was defeated. In the latter part
of 1856, however, when, under the new Constitution Act, two
representative Houses were established, he was elected for Pembroke
without opposition, and retained his seat, being for several years
Chairman of Committees, until it became vacant by effluxion of time
on March 21st, 1876, when, holding an office of emolument under the
Crown, he was no longer eligible for re-election. Mr. Whyte held a
seat in the Gregson Ministry as a member of the Executive Council
without office from Feb. to May 1857. Having been a prominent
member of the Opposition to the Chapman Ministry, Mr. Whyte was
entrusted with the formation of a Cabinet on their defeat in Jan.
1863, and took office as Premier and Chief Secretary. He, however,
resigned in Nov. 1866, on the condemnation by the Assembly of the
proposal to impose an income and property tax. In 1870 Mr Whyte, as
a private member, carried a bill for the suppression of the scab
disease in sheep, which was then making fearful ravages, and
accepted the office of Chief Inspector under the provisions of the
measure. This, as before stated, necessitated his retirement from
parliament. He died on August 21st, 1880.</p>

S.M., was born in 1794, and was admitted a solicitor of the Court
of Chancery in 1818. He was appointed Public Prosecutor of South
Australia in 1836, and shortly afterwards police magistrate. He was
the first Commissioner of Insolvency, and presiding magistrate of
the Adelaide local court until March 1856, when he retired on a
pension. Mr. Wigley died at Grunthall on Oct. 19th, 1876.</p>

<p><a name="A1496" id="A1496"></a><b>Wilkinson, Charles Smith</b>,
F.L.S., F.G.S., Government Geologist, New South Wales, was the
fourth son of the late David Wilkinson, C.E., who emigrated to
Victoria in 1852, and took a prominent part in the initiation of
railway and steamboat communication in that colony. He was born in
Northamptonshire in 1843, and educated at Ebly, near Stroud, in
Gloucestershire, and, after arriving in Melbourne, at Fenner's
Collegiate School in that city. In Dec. 1859 he was appointed to
the Geological Survey Office of Victoria, under Mr. Selwyn. In 1861
he acted as field assistant to the late Mr. Daintree in his
explorations of the country northward of Bass's Straits, and in
1863 was associated with Mr. Reginald Murray in the exploration of
the Cape Otway Ranges. Here some important geological discoveries
were made, and Mr. Wilkinson's reports and maps were subsequently
published. He also made some important investigations relating to
the deposits of gold and the formation of gold nuggets, which he
communicated to the Royal Society of Victoria. Having succeeded Mr.
Daintree in 1866, he resigned his appointment under the Victorian
Government in 1868, in consequence of ill health, and resided at
Wagga Wagga, N.S.W., for three years. In 1872 he passed the
examination for licensed surveyors in that colony, and was employed
upon surveys in the New England and Murrumbidgee districts. In 1874
he received the appointment of Geological Surveyor under the
Surveyor-General of New South Wales in the department of the
Minister of Lands. In 1875 he was transferred to the Mines
Department, and collected and arranged most of the fossils and
minerals in the Museum of Mines. The fossil discoveries in the
gold drifts and coal measures of New South Wales elicited the
acknowledgments of the leading palaeontologists, and a new genus
and several new species have been named after him. Mr. Wilkinson
was a Fellow of the Royal Society of New South Wales, and of the
Linnæan and Geological Societies of London. In 1890 he was
appointed to take charge of the collections forwarded by New South
Wales to the Exhibition of Mining and Metallurgy, held at the
Crystal Palace in that year. Mr. Wilkinson died on August 26th,
1891.</p>

<p><a name="A1497" id="A1497"></a><b>Wilkinson, William Hattam</b>,
District Court Judge, New South Wales, is the son of Captain Henry
Richard Wilkinson, H.E.I.C.S., and Deborah Jane (Busby) his wife;
and nephew of the late Rev. Frederick Wilkinson, M.A., one of the
early colonial chaplains, and emigrated to the colony in 1852. He
was called to the Bar in Sydney in Dec. 1858, and in 1860 was
appointed Associate to the late Mr. Justice Wise. He is the author
of "Wilkinson's Australian Magistrate," which has gone through
several editions, the first of which was published in 1860. He was
for eight years the authorised reporter for the Common Law division
of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, and the first eight
volumes of the Supreme Court reports bear his name. In 1864, on the
death of Mr. C. K. Murray, he became one of the parliamentary
draftsmen, in 1870 a Crown prosecutor, and in 1874 District Court
Judge and Chairman of Quarter Sessions in the Metropolitan and
Hunter district, a position he still holds. Judge Wilkinson, who
was educated at the Bluecoat School and King's College, London,
married in Feb. 1852 Elizabeth Sibyl, daughter of W. Milligan,
M.D., of the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons.</p>

<p><a name="A1500" id="A1500"></a><b>Williams, Ven. Henry</b>,
Archdeacon of Waimate, N.Z. was the third son of Thomas Williams
and Mary (Marsh) his wife, and was born at Nottingham, England, in
1792. He entered the royal navy, to which profession his
grandfather and three maternal uncles had belonged, in 1806, during
the war with France, being commissioned to serve under Sir Joseph
Yorke, a friend of his family, first in the Harfleur, and
afterwards in several other war-ships. He was one of the volunteers
who joined Captain (afterwards Sir Charles) Napier, to co-operate
with the army under the command of Lord Wellington; and after that
expedition had been countermanded, he joined
the Thames under Captain Walpole, and continued in
her till the peace. At Copenhagen in 1807 he served both afloat and
ashore, working at the land batteries, and was told off for a
forlorn hope on the eve of the capitulation. After seeing much
farther service at the Cape, the Mauritius, Madras, and Calcutta,
until 1815, when he was made lieutenant, he retired on half-pay,
which he continued to draw until 1827, when the Admiralty ordered
that all officers in holy orders should be struck off the pay list.
Having been informed that the Church Missionary Society were about
to equip a vessel for the New Zealand station, he offered to take
the command. Their intention had already been relinquished, but he
was told that he might be received as a missionary. He closed with
the proposal, expecting to be employed as a layman, and addressed
himself forthwith to preparation for the work. Disastrous news
meantime arrived from New Zealand. Intelligence was daily expected
in England that the Society's pioneers had been expelled from the
country, and that the mission would have to be altogether
abandoned. Meanwhile he turned his attention to surgery and
medicine, for the practice of which, especially of the former, he
found much occasion during his after-career. He also strove to
acquire a general knowledge of all crafts likely to be of practical
use in an uncivilised country. In 1820 he went to Balder, where he
remained until Sept. 1821, when he went to Hampstead. While at
Balder he was directed by the Society to remain at least two years
longer in England, and to study for ordination. He was ordained
both deacon and priest in June 1822. Bad news from New Zealand
being again received, the Society offered to change Mr. Williams's
scene of labour; but he induced them to permit him to proceed to
his former destination. Arriving at Hobart Town, Tasmania, Mr.
Williams met that eminent missionary pioneer Samuel Marsden for the
first time. Proceeding to Sydney, he lost no time in engaging a
passage to New Zealand, landing at the Bay of Islands in August
1823. His first station was at Paihia, a few miles up the harbour,
and for upwards of forty-four years he laboured as a missionary in
New Zealand. So much was he beloved by the Maoris, whose rights he
on many occasions vindicated, that they subscribed the sum of £200
for the erection of a monument to his memory, refusing any
contribution from Europeans. Archdeacon Williams died on July 16th,
1867, at Pakaraka, where he was buried. He was appointed to the
archidiaconate by Bishop Selwyn in 1844, and fell into
disfavour with the Church Missionary Society in 1848 through his
refusal to surrender large land purchases which he had made from
the natives' In 1850 the Society dismissed him, but in 1854, after
conference with Bishop Selwyn and Sir George Grey, they revoked
their censure, and requested him to return. Archdeacon Williams,
whose life was written by his son-in-law, Hugh
Carleton (q.v.), married on Jan. 20th, 1818, Marianne,
daughter of Wright Coldham, who survived him, and died at Pakaraka
on Dec. 16th, 1879.</p>

under Major Thomas at the storming of the Eureka Stockade during
the gold-diggers' riots at Ballarat, Vict., in 1854. He became
lieutenant in the 12th Foot in May 1857, and lieutenant on the
volunteer staff of South Australia in May 1860. He was appointed
lieutenant in command of the "Sydney volunteers" for the New
Zealand Militia in Sept. 1863; adjutant to the left wing, under
Colonel Moule, in April 1864; and captain in the New Zealand
Militia in Feb. 1865. Whilst serving in New Zealand he was present
with General Sir Duncan Campbell's forces in their advance against
the Maori position at Mere Mere, Waikato, at the repulse of the
Maoris at the Waira river, the capture of Orakau, and with the
expeditionary force under Brigadier-General Carey from the Thames
district to the Queen's Redoubt. In July 1877 he was appointed

1857, and was called to the English Bar in Nov. 1859. He arrived in
New Zealand in 1861, and in the following year went into
partnership with Mr. T. S. Duncan, then provincial solicitor, an
office which he himself subsequently held for several years. In
Jan. 1871 he gave up practice and was land registrar of the

<p><a name="A1503" id="A1503"></a><b>Williams, Right Rev.
William</b>, D.C.L., first Bishop of Waiapu, N.Z., was the fourth
son of the late Thomas Williams and younger brother of
Archdeacon Williams (q.v.). He was born at Nottingham,
England, on July 18th, 1800, and was educated at a Moravian school
at Fairfield, near Manchester, and at the Southwell Grammar School.
He was intended for the medical profession, and was actually
articled to a surgeon. He, however, decided to take holy orders,
and leaving Southwell in 1822, proceeded to Magdalen Hall, Oxford,
where he graduated B.A. in 1824, being ordained deacon and priest
the same year. In 1826 he emigrated to New Zealand under the
auspices of the Church Missionary Society, having previously
further qualified himself for missionary life in the bush by
walking the London hospitals, and thus acquiring surgical
experience prior to his departure. In association with his brother
and the Rev. Robert Maunsell, he was active in obtaining Maori
signatures to the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. In 1843 he was
appointed Archdeacon of Waiapu by Bishop Selwyn. In Dec. 1850 the
University of Oxford conferred on him the honorary degree of
D.C.L., and in April 1859 he was consecrated first Bishop of
Waiapu, a position which he resigned shortly before his death.
Bishop Williams compiled a "Dictionary of the New Zealand Language"
(1849, second edition 1858), and wrote "Christianity amongst the
New Zealanders" (1867). In 1826 the Bishop translated a portion of
Genesis into Maori. In 1844 he revised the Maori Prayer-book in
conjunction with Messrs. Maunsell and Puckey. He also, with the
help of several coadjutors, revised the Maori Old Testament in 1847
and the New Testament in 1867. Bishop Williams, who married Miss
Jane Nelson, died at Napier on March 26th, 1876.</p>

<p><a name="A1504" id="A1504"></a><b>Williamson, James Cassius</b>,
was born in Mercer, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., on August 26th, 1845. Up
to 1871 Mr. Williamson worked hard as a humble member of Wallack's
Theatre, New York. In that year he accepted an engagement as
principal comedian in the California Theatre, San Francisco, and in
1873 married Miss Maggie Moore, a member of the company. In 1875
began the Australian career of this talented couple, at the Theatre
Royal, Melbourne, under the management of Messrs. Coppin,
Harwood, Stewart &amp; Co. While "starring" during this celebrated
Australian engagement, Mr. Williamson showed his general capacity
as a comedian and character actor, and his performance of Dion
Boucicault's Kerry was regarded as an artistic triumph by
the critics and playgoing public of Melbourne and Sydney. Mr. and
Mrs. Williamson, animated by their success in Australia,
took Struck Oil to London, and played it for one hundred
nights at the Adelphi Theatre, and then "starred" for two years in
their native America. In 1879 they returned to Australia, and in
1882 Mr. Williamson joined Mr. Arthur Garner and Mr.
Musgrove in forming their powerful managerial combination. Since
then Mr. Williamson has appeared in the dual capacity of actor and
manager, and has made more than one business trip to England and
America. He and his partners have spared no expense or trouble in
introducing dramatic and operatic novelties, and in securing
first-class actors and singers for their various theatres. The
expenditure involved in such an undertaking would probably astound
the English no less than the colonial public. The managerial "trio"
has recently broken up by the retirement of Mr. Musgrove, a nephew
of the late William Saurin Lyster. But they have displayed
unequalled enterprise for the past eight years in the importation
of so many London plays and operas&mdash;including the whole range of
Gilbert and Sullivan opera&mdash;and of performers such as Miss
Geneviève Ward and Mr. W. H. Vernon, Mr. Charles Warner, Mr. J. L.
Toole and Company, Miss Nellie Farren, Mr. Fred Leslie, and the
Gaiety Company, and others too numerous to specify; while Mr.
Williamson is now promising his patrons a visit from Madame Sarah
Bernhardt, and had already purchased, before its London production,
Sir Arthur Sullivan's Ivanhoe. In other words, the dramatic
and operatic amusements of Australia have been placed by this firm
fairly on a level with those of London, Paris and New York&mdash;a fact
further emphasised by the erection of the palatial Princess's
Theatre in Spring Street, facing the Houses of Parliament, which is
fitted with every modern contrivance of comfort and luxury,
including a "movable roof" for the summer season.</p>

<p><a name="A1505" id="A1505"></a><b>Williamson, John</b>, in
conjunction with Mr. W. C. Wilson, founded the New
Zealander newspaper, first published in 1845, and for twenty
years exercised an important influence on New Zealand politics. He
was three times elected to the office of Superintendent of the
province of Auckland, a position which under the original
constitution of New Zealand was analogous to a
lieutenant-governorship in Canada, the provinces, however, in New
Zealand being very much smaller. Mr. Williamson represented
Auckland in the Parliament of the colony down to the time of his
death. He was a man of broad Liberal views, and was a member of the
second Fox Ministry, without portfolio, from July 12th to
August 2nd, 1861. He was also one of the founders of the Bank of
New Zealand. Mr. Williamson died in Feb. 1875.</p>

<p><a name="A1506" id="A1506"></a><b>Willis, John Walpole</b>,
first resident judge of Victoria, second son of Captain William
Willis, of Badsworth, co. York, by Mary, only daughter and heiress
of Robert Hamilton Smyth, of Lismore, co. Down, was born on Jan.
4th, 1793, and educated at the Charterhouse and Trinity Hall,
Cambridge. He was called to the English Bar, and married, firstly,
on August 8th, 1824, Lady Mary Isabella Lyon, daughter of Thomas,
11th Earl of Strathmore. This marriage was dissolved in 1833; and
Mr. Willis married, secondly, on Sept. 15th, 1836, Ann Susanna
Kent, eldest daughter of the late Colonel Thomas Henry Bund, of
Wick House, co. Worcester. Mr. Willis was author of a well-known
treatise on "Equity Pleading"; and in 1827 was appointed Judge of
the Supreme Court or Upper Canada. He was deposed from the bench by
the Governor, who dissented from a judgment which he delivered
impugning the legality of detaining certain political prisoners. He
was, however, reinstated on appeal to the King in Council; but did
not return to Canada. Mr. Willis was subsequently employed in the
West Indies in the adjustment of compensation claims under the
Slavery Emancipation Act, and was a judge in British Guiana. He
returned to England in 1836; and was subsequently appointed second
Puisne Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, where he
arrived on Nov. 3rd, 1837; and where, whilst his uprightness and
legal acumen were respected, his eccentricities were constantly
bringing him into collision with the Bar and the authorities. He
was appointed Resident Judge of Victoria, where he arrived on March
10th, 1840. In a short time he aroused the ire of the local
magnates by attempting to compel the attendance of justices of the
peace at the criminal sittings of the Supreme Court, in order that
they might be instructed in the exercise of their magisterial
functions. He also lectured the members of the Bar upon their
private and pecuniary concerns; and at last excited so much
hostility that, upon a petition from a number of influential
residents, Sir George Gipps summarily suspended him from his
judicial functions. This exercise of power was anything but popular
with the mass of the population; and when Mr. Willis left
Melbourne, on Feb. 13th, 1843, he was escorted to the ship by some
four hundred of the inhabitants, who expressed sincere sorrow at
the departure of one whom they regarded as no respecter of persons,
and an eminently impartial administrator of justice. Mr. Willis, on
his return, appealed to the Home Government for redress; but
received no compensation beyond the heavy arrears of salary which
accrued whilst his case was under consideration. He retired from
the practice of the law in 1852, and spent the last years of his
life in retirement at Wick House, Worcester, of which county he was
a J.P. and D.L. He died on Sept. 10th, 1877.</p>

<p><a name="A1507" id="A1507"></a><b>Willoughby, Howard</b>, one of
the leading journalists of Victoria, joined the reporting staff of
the Melbourne Age soon after his arrival in the colony in
1860. and subsequently joined the Argus reporting staff.
He was special correspondent for the latter journal in New Zealand
during the last Maori war, and was with the headquarters of General
Cameron during the campaign, which resulted, after severe fighting,
in the conquest of the Waikato and the retreat of the King tribes
to the interior. Soon after his return to Victoria, Mr. Willouhgby
was despatched by the Argus to Western Australia to
investigate the convict system there. His letters showing the
inordinate expense of the system to Great Britain and its injustice
to the free colonies, to whose shores the exex-convicts steadily
found their way, were of great service in securing the abolition of
the last remnant of transportation to Australia. In 1866 the
Government commenced the publication of the Victorian Hansard, and
Mr. Willoughby became one of the official staff. From this post he
retired in 1869, to take the editorship of the Melbourne Daily
Telegraph, then just established. Mr. Willoughby remained in charge
of this journal until 1877, when his services were again secured.
by the Argus as a contributor, and charge of the
reporting staff of the paper. Many of Mr. Willoughby's papers, such
as "The British Convict in Western Australia," "Critiques on
Spiritualism," "The Critic in Church," have been republished in
separate form with success. Mr. Willoughby in 1891 made a valuable
contribution to the literature of intercolonial federation by the
issue of a brochure comprising a series of letters originally
written for the Melbourne Argus newspaper.</p>

<p><a name="A1508" id="A1508"></a><b>Wills, William John</b>, the
ill-fated explorer, was the son of a medical man, and was born at
Totnes, in Devonshire, on Jan. 5th, 1834. He emigrated to Victoria
in 1852, and was at first engaged as a shepherd on the Edwards
river. Subsequently he was employed as a surveyor in Melbourne. In
1858 he became assistant to Professor Neumayer at the Melbourne
Observatory, and in August 1860 was selected to
accompany Burke in his famous but ill-fated expedition
for penetrating across the Australian continent from sea to sea.
When the expedition started from Melbourne, Landells was second in
command, but at Menindie, on the Darling, he became insubordinate,
and Mr. Wills took his place. With his leader, Burke, the latter
pushed on northwards till they reached the estuary of the sea into
which falls the Flinders. Having thus accomplished the object of
the expedition, Burke and Wills, with their two subordinates, King
and Gray, made back for the depot at Cooper's Creek, where they
arrived on April 21st, 1861, only to find that Brahe, whom they had
left behind, with orders to remain, had quitted the depot with most
of the stock of provisions that morning. The delay incurred in
burying Gray, who had succumbed to his privations, was the occasion
of this mishap, which would not have proved irretrievable had
Wills's advice to follow promptly in Brahe's tracks commended
itself to Burke, who, however, obstinately insisted on making for
one of the nearest stations in South Australia. Exhausted with this
bootless quest, they had to return to Cooper's Creek, where Wills
revisited the depot again, just too late to encounter Brahe, who
had been and gone for the second time. On June 29th, at the request
of Wills, Burke and King went in search of natives, from whom they
hoped to get succour. Burke soon succumbed, and King then returned
to Cooper's Creek, only to find Wills dead. He had kept a journal
to the last, and this was subsequently recovered, and bears
eloquent testimony to his calm, courageous nature. In the meantime
great apprehension prevailed in Melbourne, and the father of Wills
besought the Exploration Committee to do something. He was anxious
to conduct a search party himself, but the leadership was wisely
given to Mr. Alfred Howitt, who rescued King and buried the
remains of Wills in Sept Returning to Melbourne in Nov., he was
sent back the following month to bring the remains of the explorers
to the capital, where they were reinterred with great pomp on Jan.
21st, 1863. Mr. Wills's mother was subsequently pensioned by the
Victorian Government, whilst gratuities were given to his sisters.
In a despatch which Sir Henry Barkly, then Governor of
Victoria, wrote to the Home Government detailing the sad fate of
Burke and Wills, he thus pronounced their fitting epitaph: "So fell
two as gallant spirits as ever sacrificed life for the extension of
science or the cause of mankind. Both were in their prime; both
sacrificed comfort and competency to embark in an enterprise by
which they hoped to render their names glorious; both died without
a murmur, evincing their loyalty and devotion to their country to
the last." In 1863 was published in London "A Successful
Exploration through the Interior of Australia from Melbourne to the
Gulf of Carpentaria. From the Journals and Letters of W. J. Wills,
edited by W. Wills."</p>

Tenney, he subsequently joined the Roman Catholic Church. In his
twenty-first year Robert entered Oscott College, and on the

priesthood on Dec. 16th, 1824, by the famous controversialist,
Bishop Milner. He was immediately appointed to Nottingham, where he
achieved such a repute for energy that Dr. Ullathorne, till
then Vicar-General of Australia, determined to secure his services
for the Colonial Church, and procured his nomination as first
Bishop of Hobart. Dr. Willson was astounded when he heard the news
of the nomination, and used his best endeavours to evade the
proffered dignity, but without success. Even Cardinal Wiseman
endeavoured to keep him in England, but Pope Gregory XVI. insisted
on the nomination being upheld, and Dr. Willson was duly
consecrated by Dr. (afterwards Cardinal) Wiseman in Oct. 1842. He
sailed for Tasmania at the end of Jan. 1844, and landed in Hobart
on the 11th of the following May. For the next two-and-twenty years
he laboured energetically and successfully to build up and organise
the Roman Catholic Church in Tasmania He also earned the respect
and admiration of all denominations for his self-sacrificing
exertions on behalf of the convict population and the insane.
General regret was experienced all over the colony when failing
health compelled his retirement, and quite a host of farewell
addresses was presented to the popular prelate. He embarked on Feb.
27th, 1865, but on the voyage home was struck down by paralysis. He
was never afterwards able to officiate at the altar, but with the
aid of a servant he was able to walk a little in Nottingham, where
he lingered for a year, expiring on June 30th, 1866. His funeral
oration was pronounced by Dr. Ullathorne, who published a memoir of
the prelate in 1887, and his life has been sympathetically written
by the Rev. T. Kelsh, of the diocese of Hobart, and published at
the office of the Hobart Mercury.</p>

D.D., is the son of Joseph Wm. Wilson of Slenley, Surrey, and was
born at Birmingham in 1853. He was educated at Merchant Taylors'
School in London, and having secured a scholarship at St. John's
College, Oxford, he took a second-class in Classical Moderations in
1873, and a first-class in Litteræ Humaniores in 1875. He graduated
B.A. in 1876, and was elected a Fellow of Queen's College, Oxford,
an appointment which he retained till 1881. In the same year he
became lecturer of Queen's and St. John's Colleges simultaneously,
and in December was ordained deacon by the Bishop of Oxford. In
1877 he was appointed tutor of St. John's, which position he
resigned, and the next year became classical tutor at the Diocesan
College at Rondesbosch, in Cape Colony, and head master of St.
Mark's Grammar School, George. In March of this year he was
ordained priest by the Bishop of Capetown, and took his degree of
M.A. at Oxford in absence. In 1879 he was appointed Classical
Examiner in the University of Capetown, which conferred on him the
hon. degree of M.A. In 1880 Dr. Wilson returned to England, and
accepted the head-mastership of the Carlisle Grammar School, a post
which he held till 1885, when he was appointed to his present
position as head master of the Melbourne Church of England Grammar
School. In 1882 he took the Oxford degree of B.D., and in 1885 had
that of D.D. conferred on him. Dr. Wilson was married at St.
Margaret's Bay, near Dover, on Sept. 3rd, 1880, to Miss Julia Mary
Lawrence.</p>

<p><a name="A1511" id="A1511"></a><b>Wilson, Hon. Andrew Heron</b>,
M.L.C., son of Andrew Wilson and Grace (Heron) his wife, was born
in August 1844 at Ayr, Scotland, and educated at the Academy in
that town. He emigrated to Queensland in 1864, and is now a large
saw-mill owner at Maryborough in that colony. Mr. Wilson was called
to the Legislative Council in 1883. He was married at Cunning Park,
Ayr, to Miss Jessie Adam.</p>

<p><a name="A1512" id="A1512"></a><b>Wilson, Edward</b>, was born
at Hampstead in 1814, and after completing his education he
embarked in the Manchester trade in London. The confinement was not
to his taste, and he proceeded to Australia in 1842. The infant
settlement of Melbourne attracted him, and he took up a cattle
station near Dandenong. He soon became an adverse and
uncompromising critic of the political administration of
Mr. C. J. Latrobe, the superintendent of the district of Port
Phillip. The reception which his vigorous letters received induced
him to turn his thoughts to journalism, and in 1847 he purchased
the Melbourne Argus from Mr. Wm. Kerr, incorporating with
it the Patriot, which was the lineal descendant of the first
newspaper published in Melbourne. A few years later the Daily
News was bought and merged in the Argus, which was
conducted with such indomitable energy and enterprise, and such
conspicuous literary ability by Mr. Wilson, that it prospered
immensely, notwithstanding the difficulty of producing a daily
paper in such a disorganised state of society as resulted from the
outbreak of the gold fever in 1852. Prior to this Mr. Wilson had
taken a leading part in the resistance which was offered by the
colonists to the influx of convicts from Tasmania, and which led to
the passing of the Convicts Prevention Act. He strenuously
supported the separation of Port Phillip from New South Wales; he
cooperated earnestly with the Anti-transportation League founded in
1851; he denounced the unjust and irritating conduct of
Governor Hotham towards the mining population; he largely
contributed to secure the establishment of responsible government
in the colony; and he was the first to advocate a popular land
policy, and the recession of the pastoral tenants of the crown
before the advance of agricultural settlement. He was also the
founder of the Acclimatisation Society of Victoria, and is credited
with the distinction of having introduced the lark, thrush, and
other British songbirds, as well as the sparrow, into Australia.
After many years of severe intellectual labour, Mr. Wilson, in
1857, returned to England, but revisited Australia and New Zealand
in the following year, finally settling at Hayes, in Kent, in 1864,
where he lived a life of dignified retirement until Jan. 10th,
1878, when his death took place as the result of a paralytic
seizure. He was one of the founders of the Colonial Institute in
1868, and was ever earnest in promoting any movement calculated to
benefit the colony he had been largely instrumental in calling into
existence.</p>

Council for Hobart Town in 1859. He was a member of the Whyte
Ministry without portfolio from Jan. 1863, when he was sworn of the
Executive Council, until Nov. 1866. Three years later he became
Premier, and held office as Colonial Secretary from August 1869 to

Deborah Hope, third daughter of Peter Degraves, of Cascade, Hobart
Town, was field officer in command of the Tasmanian Volunteers in
1860, received the Queen's permission to bear the title of
Honourable within the colony in 1866, and was knighted in 1873. He
died at Hobart on March 9th, 1880, the 68th anniversary of his
birthday.</p>

at the Edinburgh and Aberdeen Universities. He arrived in Australia
in June 1840, and in 1859 was elected to the New South Wales
Parliament for the Southern Goldfields, being afterwards returned
for Patrick's Plains and East Sydney. Mr. Wilson was Secretary for
Lands in the Martin Ministry from Oct. 1863 to Feb. 1865,
and under the same premier from Jan. 1866 to Oct. 1868, and Dec.
1870 to May 1872. Mr. Wilson distinguished himself by his efforts
to secure parks and recreation grounds for the people of Sydney. He

K.C.S.I., C.B., was born at Onamore, in the Madras Presidency, on
May 21st, 1808, and sent to England for his education. He returned
to India in 1828, having been appointed to a subordinate position
in the Indian Civil Service, but he was soon promoted to be
assistant commissioner to Sir William Sleeman, with whom he greatly
distinguished himself by his success in suppressing Thuggism. He
was shortly afterwards made a magistrate of Cawnpore. In 1841 he
was transferred to Moradabad, where he acted as magistrate and
collector until 1853, He was then ordered a change of climate on
medical grounds, and, obtaining leave of absence, sailed for
Melbourne, on his way to Canterbury, N.Z., where he became a
settler. In May 1855, his leave of absence expiring, he returned to
Calcutta and resumed his office of judge at Moradabad. Of his
services during the Mutiny Lord Canning, the Governor-General of
India, wrote under date July 2nd, 1859, that he had "the enviable
distinction of having, by his obstinate energy and perseverance,
saved more Christian lives than any man in India. He did this,"
Lord Canning added, "at the repeatedly imminent risk of his own
life." In recognition of his services he was made C.B. in 1860, and
K.C.S.I. in 1872. He also received the Indian Mutiny medal. After
the suppression of the Mutiny, Sir John Cracroft Wilson returned to
New Zealand, where he resided in the Canterbury district and was
many years a member of the Provincial Council. He also represented
a Canterbury constituency in the Lower House of the General
Assembly of New Zealand. He died at Cashmere, Canterbury, on May
2nd, 1881. He married in 1844, as his second wife, Jane Lorrie,
daughter of James Greig, who still survives.</p>

<p><a name="A1517" id="A1517"></a><b>Wilson, Sir Samuel</b>, is the
sixth son of the late Samuel Wilson, farmer and landowner, of
Antrim, Ireland. He was born at Ballycloughan in 1832, and educated
at Ballymena, in the same county. After leaving school, he had
three years' experience in linen manufacture with his
brother-in-law, and then went into that business conjointly with
farming on his own account. On the advice of a brother, he went to
Melbourne in 1852, and worked as a miner on the Ballarat, Fryer's
Creek, Ovens, and Bendigo diggings, with some success. Leaving
mining pursuits, he took the management of the Kewell station with
twenty thousand sheep for his brother, and having practically
learned station work there, he sold a small property he had in
Ireland, and joined his brother in the purchase of the Longerenong
station on the Wimmera, the investment turning out a highly
successful one, owing in a great measure to his having developed
large tracts of unwatered country by the construction of dams and
water-channels. The brothers also bought a number of other
stations, notably the Yanko station on the Murrumbidgee, N.S.W.,
which they improved in a similar manner. In 1869 Mr. Wilson became
the purchaser of the whole of the property of the firm, and, after
a few years of almost unprecedented success, he sold Longerenong,
Coree, and Goongambla, and invested in Mount Bute, Marathon, and
Corangamite estates, after which, being tempted with the offer of
Ercildoune, near Burrumbeet, a station noted for its breed of
merino sheep, he bought that beautiful estate, and made it his
colonial home. He also went into squatting ventures in New South
Wales and Queensland. Sir Samuel Wilson formerly represented the
Wimmera district in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, and sat
in the Legislative Council for the Western Province from 1875 to
1880. He also took great interest in acclimatisation, and devoted
time and money toward the introduction of English salmon into
Victorian waters. He gave £30,000, or with accrued interest
£37,000, for the erection of the Wilson Hall in connection with
Melbourne University, the first stone being laid in Oct. 1879. In
1861 Sir (then Mr.) Samuel Wilson married Jeannie, daughter of the
Hon. W. Campbell. In 1875 he was knighted by patent. For a number
of years past Sir Samuel has resided in England, where he has
rented the estate of Hughenden Manor, formerly the residence of the
late Lord Beaconsfield. Sir Samuel unsuccessfully contested the
division of Buckinghamshire in which the property is situated in
1885, but was elected to the House of Commons for Portsmouth in
1886. He did not seek re-election in 1892.</p>

Denbighshire, on July 15th, 1839, and arrived in Victoria in 1853.
In 1865 he was admitted a solicitor of the Supreme Court in
Queensland, and practises in Brisbane. Having been called to the
Legislative Council in July 1885, he succeeded Mr. T. M. Patterson
as Postmaster-General in the Griffith Government in
August 1887, retiring with his colleagues in June 1888.</p>

<p><a name="A1519" id="A1519"></a><b>Wilson, Hon. William</b>, was
born on Feb. 16th, 1834, at Renton, two miles from Dumbarton. He
emigrated to Australia in Oct. 1852, in the ship Sir William
Molesworth&mdash;a joint stock concern&mdash;all the passengers having an
interest in her. The captain and crew went out on 1s. per month
wages, in order to get their discharge on landing. Shortly after
his arrival, in 1853, Mr. Wilson commenced business in the timber
trade at Geelong as a member of the firm of Tate, Wilson &amp;
Wright. After they had straggled through the commercial crisis of
1854, the partnership was dissolved, whereupon Mr. Wilson went into
the New Zealand trade, bringing oats, etc., to the Fiery Creek
rush. He afterwards bought a business there, and on the opening of
the Canton lead at Ararat opened a wholesale store there. Three
years later he sold his business, and turned his attention, with a
fair measure of success, to pastoral pursuits, first on the Lower
Goulburn and then in the Lower Wimmera. He then joined the firm of
Boyd, M?Naught &amp; Boyd, which was subsequently known as Wilson,
Crosbie &amp; Co. He had been one of the earliest town councillors
of Ararat; and was about the time just mentioned returned to the
Legislative Assembly for the district. Mr. Wilson was Commissioner
of Railways in the M?Culloch Government from Sept. 2nd to
20th, 1869, and again under the same Premier from April 9th, 1870,
to June 19th, 1871. At the following election he was defeated by
Mr. Carroll, but was soon afterwards returned to the Legislative
Council as a representative of the eastern province. He afterwards
retired and paid a somewhat lengthened visit to Europe. He
re-entered the political arena for a short time in 1881, when he
opposed the re-election of Mr. David Gaunson at Ararat,
on his appointment as Commissioner of Crown Lands, and succeeded in
defeating him by a considerable majority. He did not, however,
again offer himself at the general election in 1883. Mr. Wilson was
in England from 1885 to 1886, when he returned to the colony. In
1873 he became a director of the National Bank of Australasia, and
was chairman of the board in 1876. Mr. Wilson was largely
interested in pastoral pursuits in Victoria and New South Wales,
and was also chairman of the Evening Standard Newspaper Company of
Melbourne. He died on Nov. 16th, 1891.</p>

<p><a name="A1520" id="A1520"></a><b>Wilson, William Chisholm</b>,
was one of the fathers of New Zealand journalism. He was a
practical printer by trade, and entered into partnership with Mr.
John Williamson in the publication of the New
Zealander newspaper, which first saw the light at Auckland in
1845. Mr. Wilson introduced the first Caxton printing machine into
New Zealand, and also established the first gasworks, having
purchased a small plant to light his own offices. Differences with
his partner over the policy of the paper led to a dissolution in
1863, and a few months later Mr. Wilson started the New
Zealand Herald, which soon extinguished its predecessor. In
connection with this journal Mr. Wilson started a weekly issue.
Although unwilling to enter public life, Mr. Wilson actively
assisted in founding many Auckland institutions, among the most
noteworthy being the Bank of New Zealand and the New Zealand
Insurance Company, of which he remained a director till his death
on July 10th, 1876. The Herald under his management
became the leading morning paper in the colony. After his demise
the business was carried on by his sons, Messrs. W. S. and J. L.
Wilson, who had previously assisted in its management. They entered
into partnership with Mr. A. G. Horton, who had purchased
the Southern Cross, the other morning journal, from
Sir Julius Vogel, and the two papers were amalgamated,
the Southern Cross becoming merged into
the Herald and the weekly issue of the latter paper
losing its identity in the Weekly News, an older journal
published in connection with the Southern Cross.</p>

with his parents in 1835, and was educated at Cape's School,
Sydney, and at the King's School, Parramatta. He entered the
University of Sydney on its opening in 1852, and took a general and
classical scholarship. He carried off the English essay prize,
instituted by Dr. Woolley, during several successive years, and
graduated with distinction in classics at the head of his year in
1856, taking also a first class in Mental Philosophy, being the
senior of all Australian graduates. He was admitted to the Bar of
New South Wales in March 1857, and became a contributor and
subsequently law reporter to the Empire newspaper,
published in Sydney. In Jan. 1859 he was appointed sole Crown
Prosecutor for the Country Districts of New South Wales. After
resigning this post, and unsuccessfully contesting Paddington
against Sir Daniel Cooper, he was elected to the Assembly in August
1859, for the Lower Hunter, and subsequently represented West
Sydney from 1860 to 1862 and from 1866 to 1872. He was
Solicitor-General under Sir James Martin from Dec. 1870
to May 1872, and having been defeated for West Sydney in the latter
year, he was elected the first member for the University of Sydney
in Sept. 1876, and sat for that constituency till his retirement
from politics. He held office as Attorney-General in the Parkes
Administration from March to August 1877, and again in
the Parkes-Robertson Ministry, from Dec. 1878 to August
1879, when he was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of New
South Wales. Mr. Justice Windeyer was elected a member of the
Senate of Sydney University at the first convocation in 1865, and
is a Fellow of the University, and was Vice-Chancellor from 1884 to

Maitland and Goulburn, and the founding of Public Exhibitions
enabling poor but clever boys to go to the Grammar Schools from the
Public Schools and thence to the University. He was elected
President of the Sydney Mechanics* School of Arts in 1874, and in
1876 he was temporarily appointed Acting Judge of the Supreme
Court. He was President of the Public Charities Commission in 1873,
and in 1874 originated the Discharged Prisoners Aid Society. He was
married on Dec. 31st, 1857, to Mary Elizabeth, daughter of the Rev.

He was educated at the Scotch College, Melbourne, and was brought
up to pastoral pursuits, in which his father, the late Mr. John
Winter, achieved very great success. In 1857 he, with his brothers,
purchased Colbinabbin and other stations in the Rodney district at
a cost of about £200,000; and in 1868, on a friendly dissolution of
partnership, the Stanhope estate, where he still resides, fell to
his share. In 1874, in conjunction with Mr. J. Ettershank, of East
Loddon, Mr. Winter visited England, and successfully conducted the
appeal to the Privy Council against the Crown, relative to the five
shilling per acre penalty sought to be enforced against the holders
of certificated lands. Mr. Winter was for some years a member of

of articles on Australian subjects to the English magazines. He is
very eulogistically referred to in Sir Charles Dilke's
recently published "Problems of Greater Britain," and was
re-elected for South Sydney in 1891. In the following year he
published "Industrial Freedom: A Study in Politics" (Cassell &amp;
Co.). Mr. Wise was a friend and associate of the late Arnold
Toynbee, and approaches industrial questions in the spirit of that
stimulating thinker. His latest work is dedicated to Sir Henry
Parkes, "an honoured chief and friend," and has been suggested and
inspired by the circumstances of the free-trade controversy at the
Antipodes. "For seven years the writer has been engaged by the side
of Sir Henry Parkes in the forefront of an active political
controversy with the protectionists of his native country, until he
has gained an exceptional familiarity with the modes of thought and
expression that win favour for protection among voters. The aim of

<p><a name="A1528" id="A1528"></a><b>Wood, Harrie</b>, was born at
Kensington, London, on Feb. 12th, 1831. He went to Victoria in
1854, and settled at Ballarat, where in 1858 he was appointed
secretary to the Mining Board. In 1861 he introduced a scheme for
the registration of mining titles, and was appointed District
Mining Registrar with a view to initiate his new system which was
approved by the Minister of Mines. Mr. Wood was one of the
promoters of the Ballarat Benevolent Asylum, and the projector of
the Ballarat School of Mines. When the Mining Department of New
South Wales was established under the Mining Act of 1874, he was,
in September of that year, appointed Under-Secretary, and still
retains the post. He is the author of "Mines and Mineral Statistics
of New South Wales," a work specially compiled for the Philadelphia
Centennial Exhibition.</p>

<p><a name="A1529" id="A1529"></a><b>Wood, Hon. John
Dennistoun</b>, is the son of the late Captain Patrick Wood, of the
East India Company's military service, and was born at Dennistoun,
Tas., on July 4th, 1829. When eleven years of age he went to
England to complete his education, and entered as a student at the
Middle Temple in Nov. 1845, but was not called to the Bar till Jan.
1852. The next year Mr. Wood went out to Victoria and entered on
the practice of his profession before the Supreme Court in
Melbourne. In 1857 he was returned to the Legislative Assembly for
the Ovens district, having previously, in March of that year, been
appointed Solicitor-General in the
first O'Shanassy Government, which, however, only held
office till April 29th. In the Nicholson Administration
Mr. Wood was Attorney-General from Oct. 1859 to Nov. 1860, and he
was Minister of Justice in the third O'Shanassy Cabinet from Nov.
1861 to June 1863. Having been defeated for the Ovens, and
subsequently for Gippsland, Mr. Wood ultimately secured his return
for Warrnambool. Soon after his retirement, with his colleagues in
the O'Shanassy Ministry, Mr. Wood left Victoria, and took up his
residence in London, where he practised his profession mainly
before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in colonial
appeal cases. In 1889 he returned to Victoria, and resumed practice
at the local Bar.</p>

<p><a name="A1530" id="A1530"></a><b>Wood, Hon. Reader Gilson</b>,
was born in 1821, and educated at the Merchant Taylors' School,
London. He was brought up as an architect, and shortly after his
articles had expired left England for New Zealand, arriving in
Auckland in 1844. The northern insurrection breaking out in the
following year, Mr. Wood was made lieutenant of Volunteer
Artillery, and was present at the attempted storming of Heke's Pah
at Ohaeawai on July 1st, 1845. He was mentioned in Colonel
Despard's despatch describing that disastrous affair. After the war
Mr. Wood returned to Auckland, where he practised his profession of
architect and surveyor. About 1848 he was employed by the
Government as Inspector of Roads, afterwards he was appointed
Deputy Surveyor-General, which office he retained till 1856, and in
the following year he was brought forward to represent Auckland
City East in the General Assembly, but was defeated. In 1861 he was
returned for Parnell, and in July of that year took office as
Colonial Treasurer and Commissioner of Customs in
the Fox Ministry. On August 6th, 1862, this Ministry went
out of office, but, with the exception of a brief interregnum of a
fortnight, Mr. Wood held the office of Treasurer under
the Domett and Whitaker-Fox Ministries till Nov.
24th, 1864. The financial statement put before the House by Mr.
Wood in the Whitaker-Fox Government contained the outlines of a
scheme of military settlement and the issue of a three million
loan, with a view of finally disposing of the native difficulty.
Mr. Wood toward the close of 1864 went to England as Colonial
Treasurer to negotiate for an instalment of one million out of the
three to be borrowed, and he accomplished his object. In 1865 he
resigned his seat for Parnell, but in 1870 was again elected. He
opposed the great borrowing scheme of Mr. (now Sir
Julius) Vogel with great vigour and eloquence. In 1878 he
again resigned his seat for Parnell, and took a trip to England on
private affairs. On his return to Auckland in 1879 he was elected
for Waitemata. In 1871 he carried a resolution for the abolition of
Civil Service pensions.</p>

<p><a name="A1531" id="A1531"></a><b>Woods, Hon. John</b>, M.L.A.,
second son of Richard Woods, of Liverpool, was born on Nov. 5th,
1822. After being trained as an engineer, he was employed in Canada
and England; and landed in Melbourne in 1852, after a chequered
experience at the Ovens, M'Ivor, Goulburn, Ararat and Fiery Creek
diggings, during which he was a prominent exponent of miners'
rights. He was returned to the Assembly in 1859 for the Crowlands
district, which he represented with an interval of five years,
until 1877, when he was elected for Stawell, which he represented
till his death. Whilst out of Parliament, from 1865 to 1870, Mr.
Woods entered the Government service, and was in charge of the
works at the Malmesbury reservoir, when he was summarily dismissed
on an allegation, into which inquiry was refused, that he had
connived at some laches on the part of the contractors. Mr. Woods
took office as Minister of Railways in the
first Berry Government in August 1875, and made some
sweeping changes in the tariff of charges. He retired with his
colleagues in October of the same year, but was appointed to the
same post in the second Berry Administration in May 1877, retiring
in March 1880. Mr. Woods died in May 1892.</p>

Tenison</b>, F.G.S., F.L.S., son of J. D. Woods, Q.C., F.S.A., of
the Inner Temple, for many years one of the sub-editors of the
London Times, was born in 1832 near London. He was educated at
Newington Grammar School and under the tutorship of the late Canon
Oakley at Balliol College, Oxford, where, however, he did not
graduate through becoming a convert to the Roman Catholic Church in
his student days. After passing through a course of theology in the
south of France, he was ordained a priest in 1856, and went to
Australia as a travelling missionary in the following year. Here he
laboured in the little-known country on the borders of South
Australia and Victoria, and ultimately became Vicar-General of the
diocese of Adelaide, where he established a Catholic school and
organised a teaching Order of Sisters of St. Joseph, which has
spread over the other colonies. He early took a deep interest in
the study of geology, and became proficient in all branches of
natural history. He was the author of "Geological Observations
in South Australia," "History of the Discovery and Exploration of
Australia," "Geology of Portland," "Not quite so old as the Hills,"
"North Australia and its Physical Geography," "A Geography for
Catholic Schools," "A Grammar for Catholic Schools," "Australian
Essays," and "Australian Bibliography." Mr. Woods, who latterly
resided in Sydney, was for some time the editor of two Roman
Catholic publications, the Southern Cross and
the Chaplet. His contributions to the pages of scientific
journals and the proceedings of learned societies were very
numerous and valuable. He furnished geological plans and sections
to the Government engineers of South Australia for the railway to
Victoria, when first projected. He was President of the Linnæan
Society of New South Wales, and died on Oct. 7th, 1889.</p>

<p><a name="A1533" id="A1533"></a><b>Woolley, Rev. John</b>, D.C.L.
Oxon., was the son of George Woolley, M.D., of London, and
Charlotte his wife, daughter of W. Gall, of Lewes, Sussex. He was
born at Petersfield, Hampshire, on Feb. 28th, 1816, and entered the
London University in 1830, after completing his school studies.
Here he passed through the curriculum with extraordinary success,
and won a first prize in logic. Proceeding to Oxford in 1832, he
gained an open scholarship at Exeter College, and wrote a small
work on logic. At Oxford he became the friend of Dean Stanley, who
was a contemporary Fellow of University College. In 1842 he was
appointed head-master of King Edward VI.'s Grammar School at
Hereford, and in July 1842 he married Mary Margaret, daughter of
Major Turner, of the 13th Light Dragoons. He was afterwards elected
head-master of the Northern Church of England School at Rossall,
Lancashire; and in 1846 he was appointed head of the University at
Corfu. The Greek priests petitioning against the appointment of an
English clergyman, he resigned, and was succeeded by
Sir George Bowen. In 1849 he was head-master of Norwich
Grammar School, and in Jan. 1852 he was appointed principal of the
Sydney University. Arriving in the colony in June 1852, he
discharged the additional duties of Professor of Classics and Logic
in the University until 1865, when he visited England. Whilst on
his return passage he was lost in the London, which foundered
in the Bay of Biscay, meeting death with calmness and courage. On
Jan. 11th, 1866, £2000 was raised by subscription as a tribute of
respect to his memory, and presented to his widow. Dr. Woolley
delivered the inaugural oration at the opening of the Sydney
University in August 1852, and was one of the original masters of
the Sydney Grammar School, to the organisation of which he devoted
much time and labour. He was also the first to propound a scheme,
which since his death has been developed for connecting the primary
schools of the colony with the University.</p>

<p><a name="A1534" id="A1534"></a><b>Woolls, Rev. William</b>,
Ph.D., F.L.S., the nineteenth child of Edward Woolls, merchant,of
Winchester, Hampshire, England, was born in that city in March
1814. He was educated at the Grammar School, Bishop's Waltham, and,
having failed to obtain a cadetship in the East India Company's
service, he decided, in 1831, to emigrate to Australia. Prior to
this he had published some occasional verses, and on his voyage be
composed a poem on "The Voyage to New South Wales." Landing in
Sydney, he obtained an appointment at the King's School,
Parramatta, in 1832, and later on published a poem called
"Australia," and a volume of "Miscellanies." He afterwards became
classical master at the old Sydney College, under Mr. Cape.
After leaving the college, he established a school of his own at
Parramatta, which he carried on until 1865. In the meantime he
contributed voluminously to the local press, devoting himself
latterly to the study of botany, his main work&mdash;"A Contribution to
the Flora of Australia"&mdash;becoming well known in the scientific
world. His paper on "Introduced Plants," communicated to the
Linnæan Society, was well received, and won him the fellowship of
that learned body. His "Species Plantarum Parramattensium," was
reprinted by the authorities of the University of Gottingen, who
conferred on him the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy, and
Master of Liberal Arts. He wrote a short "Life and Character of
Samuel Marsden." In 1873 Dr. Woolls took orders in the Church of
England, and was appointed to the incumbency of Richmond, and
subsequently became rural dean.</p>

Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and North America; and in 1876 arrived in
Adelaide and surveyed the Flinders Ranges and Murray Scrub, as a
clerk in the Surveyor-General's department, forming a collection of

of North Staffordshire, a fourth on the summit of Ben Nevis (4406
feet high), and a fifth in connection therewith at Fort William;
the two last under the auspices of the Scottish Meteorological
Society. Returning to Australia in Jan. 1884, he established the
Torrens Observatory at Walkerville, near Adelaide, and one at Mount
Lofty, S.A., in October of the same year. Mr. Wragge was appointed

Victoria, is the eldest son of the late Arthur Nicholas Wrixon,
formerly County Court judge in Victoria, by his marriage with Maria
Matilda, daughter of Captain Bace, a military officer who greatly
distinguished himself in the Napoleonic wars. Mr. Wrixon, who was
born in Ireland on Oct. 18th, 1839, came out to Victoria with his
father in 1850, and was one of the first fourteen students of
Melbourne University. In 1857, however, he returned to Ireland in
order to prosecute his studies at Dublin University, where he
graduated B.A. in 1861, and won two gold medals at the famous
Historical Society, attesting his powers as a speaker and a writer.
Having been called to the Irish Bar in 1861, Mr. Wrixon practised
in that country for a year, when seeing better prospects of
professional success in Australia, he returned to Victoria, and was
admitted to the Bar there in Oct. 1863. Having unsuccessfully
contested Dundas in 1864, Mr. Wrixon took a high position as an
advocate, and in 1868 was returned to the Assembly for Belfast,
which he continued to represent till 1877, when he did not present
himself for re-election owing to the unfavourable prospects created
by the reorganisation of the constituency under the Electoral Act
of 1876. In 1880, however, Mr. Wrixon successfully contested
Portland, and has represented the constituency ever since. In the
meantime he was Solicitor-General in
the M?Culloch Ministry, from April 1870 to June 1871, but
did not again take a portfolio until the formation of the
Gillies-Deakin Ministry in Feb. 1886, when he accepted the
Attorney-Generalship, retiring with his colleagues in Nov. 1890. As
a private member Mr. Wrixon advocated the Hare system of
Proportional Representation, and opposed the Service Reform Bill of
1880, on the ground of its conferring unconstitutional financial
powers on the Upper House. As Solicitor-General under Sir James
M?Culloch Mr. Wrixon carried the "Criminal Law Amendment Act,"
which made flogging the penalty in cases of criminal assault upon
women and children. Whilst last in office Mr. Wrixon aided the
Government in placing on the Statute Book consolidatory
legislation, in the interests of neglected and criminal children.
He was also instrumental in abolishing the probate duty on estates
under £1000, and in otherwise simplifying and cheapening the
administration of small estates. He procured the abolition of the
patent fees formerly paid to the Attorney-General. In 1890 Mr.
Wrixon visited England with the view of representing the colony
before the Privy Council in the appeal lodged by the Government in
the case of Ah Toy v. Musgrove, in which the Supreme Court of
Victoria had decided against the legality of the exclusion of
Chinese. Mr. Wrixon having in the meantime ceased to be
Attorney-General, Sir Horace Davey, who had also been retained, led
for the appellants; but the principal argument was that addressed
to the Court by Mr. Wrixon, and the decision of the Supreme Court
was reversed. He was made Q.C. in 1890, and was one of the
delegates at the Federal Convention. He married, in 1872,
Charlotte, daughter of the late Hon. Henry Miller. In Jan, 1892 he
was created K.C.M.G., and in April was a candidate for the
speakership of the Victorian House of Assembly in succession to
Sir M. H. Davies, but was defeated by a small majority.</p>

Buckley</b>, C.B., son of Lieut.-General William Wynyard, was born
at Kensington Palace on Dec. 28rd, 1788. He entered the 1st Foot
Guards in 1803, and was actively employed and severely wounded. On
Nov. 23rd, 1841, he was made Major-General and in 1847 appointed to
the command of the troops in New South Wales, Van Diemen's Land and
New Zealand. He became Colonel 58th Regiment, and died in London on
Nov. 24th, 1864.</p>

<p><a name="A1542" id="A1542"></a><b>Wynyard, Lieut.-General Robert
Henry</b>, C.B., sometime acting Governor of New Zealand, commanded
the 58th Regiment in New Zealand from 1845 to 1847, and on the
death of Major-General George Dean Pitt was appointed
(April 1851) Lieutenant-Governor of New Ulster, one of the two
provinces into which the colony was temporarily divided. His duties
ceased on the assumption by Sir George Grey of the office
of Governor in March 1853, and he retired after receiving
the thanks of Sir George Grey and the Colonial Office. In the
latter year General Wynyard was elected first Superintendent of the
province of Auckland, and as senior military officer in the colony
administered the government during the interval between the
departure of Sir George Grey and the arrival of Colonel Gore
Browne&mdash;Jan. 1854 to Sept. 1855. This was one of the most crucial
periods in the political life of New Zealand, as the new
Constitution Act had been received in Feb. 1853, and the first
General Assembly had been convened to meet at Auckland in May 1854.
The imperial officials still formed the Government, and the first
act of the Upper House was to pass an address to the acting
Governor requesting that responsible government should be
inaugurated without delay. General Wynyard thereupon consulted the
Executive Council, composed of the old officials, who advised him
that he might appoint two or three members of the General Assembly
to the Council to co-operate with themselves in the government of
the colony. The Attorney-General at the same time expressed the
opinion that the acting Governor under the Constitution Act and the
royal instructions was not enabled to establish "Ministerial
responsibility in the conduct of legislative and executive
proceedings by the Governor." General Wynyard thereupon nominated
Mr. J. E. Fitzgerald, the late Sir Frederick Weld, and
the late Mr. H. Sewell, all members of the Lower House, to the
Executive Council; a little later he also nominated Mr. (now
Sir) F. D. Bell to represent the Legislative Council. All
the newly appointed Councillors undertook without salary to
represent the Government in Parliament, to perform such
departmental work as might become a concomitant of their
legislative duties, and to hold office only so long as they
retained the confidence of the Legislature. Both Houses appeared
satisfied for the time with this concession, but friction soon
arose between the old and new members of the executive, the latter
recommending to General Wynyard that the former should resign, and
the Government "be reconstituted on the ordinary responsible
basis." General Wynyard declined to make so important a change
until he could obtain the views of the Crown and prorogued
Parliament till August, when the newly-appointed executive
Councillors resigned. General Wynyard then made a more decisive
advance towards responsible government by appointing to the
Executive Council Messrs. Forsaith, E. Wakefield, W. Travers, and
J. Macandrew, who, as the condition of their appointment, were to
continue to possess his (the acting Governor's) confidence as well
as that of Parliament. Two days later the new Councillors had to
withdraw on an address being carried by the extreme responsible
government party condemning a mixed executive as utterly bad. The
acting Governor therefore ruled to the end of his term with the old
officials. After leaving New Zealand General Wynyard was acting
Governor at the Cape during the absence of Sir George Grey from
1859 to 1860. He became Colonel of the 98th Regiment, and died at
Bath on Jan. 6th, 1864.</p>

1810. He spent a number of years in Tasmania, and on his return to
England, where he has long resided, after a series of patient and
very interesting experiments, succeeded in introducing salmon and
trout into the rivers of that colony, and also made the first
shipment of salmon ova to Otago, N.Z., for which he received a vote
of thanks from the provincial government, accompanied by a handsome
silver vase. He was political agent for Tasmania in 1861-3; was for
seven years hon. secretary and treasurer to the Australian
Association, which succeeded in prevailing on the Imperial
Government to establish a mail service to
Australia via the Red Sea, and in getting the Australian
sovereign made legal tender throughout the British dominions. He
was acting Agent-General for Tasmania from Feb. to Oct. 1888, when
Mr. (now Sir) Edward Braddon arrived to take up the
position. He was created C.M.G. in 1874, and K.C.M.G. on New Year's

some years, and was High Sheriff of New South Wales from 1842 to
1849. Mr. Young represented Port Phillip in the Legislative Council
of New South Wales before Victoria was formed into a separate
colony. On returning to England he was M.P. for Yarmouth from 1857
to 1859, and in 1865 was returned for Helston. Having been unseated
in the following year, he was re-elected in Dec. 1868. In 1837 Mr.
Young married Ann Eliza, daughter of Edward Smith, of Woodford
Wells, who died in 1845. Two years later he married Jane, eldest

<p><a name="A1547" id="A1547"></a><b>Young, Sir Henry Edward
Fox</b>, C.B., sometime Governor of South Australia and Tasmania,
was the third son of Colonel Sir Aretas W. Young, who was Governor
of Prince Edward Island from 1831 to 1836. He was born in 1810, and
entering the Colonial service held several official posts in the
West Indies. He was knighted in 1847, and appointed Lieut.-Governor
of the eastern province of the Cape of Good Hope; but was shortly
afterwards transferred to South Australia, where he assumed the
Governorship as the successor of Colonel Robe in August
1848. In his new capacity he was as go-ahead in his policy as his
predecessor had been cautious and reactionary. Through the offer of
a bonus of £4000 the navigability of the Murray river was
demonstrated by Captain Cadell, but Governor Young failed in his
attempt to clear away the sandy bar at its mouth, and wasted
£20,000 in the vain effort to establish a harbour at Port Elliott,
near the entrance to the river. In 1851 the discovery of gold in
Victoria deprived South Australia of a large part of its
population, who took with them most of the available coin in the
colony. In order to meet the crisis caused by the scarcity of the
circulating medium, Governor Young gave his assent to the Bullion
Act, which established a new currency consisting of gold cast into
small bars or ingots. For endorsing this measure he was censured by
the Home Government for exceeding his powers, but the necessity of
the step was not seriously called in question. By his prudent
action in establishing a reliable escort between Ballarat, in
Victoria, and Adelaide, much of the gold won at the new Eldorado
found its way to South Australia, and steps were also taken, in the
end successfully, to stimulate the discovery of the precious metal
within the colony. In Dec. 1855 Sir Henry Fox Young left South
Australia to assume the Governorship of Tasmania, where he took
office as successor to Sir William Denison in Jan. 1855,
and carried with him the necessary powers for introducing
responsible government in the island colony. This was successfully
done, and Sir Henry Fox Young held office till Dec. 1861, when he
returned to England and retired from the colonial service. He
married in 1848 the eldest daughter of Charles Marryat, of Park
Field, Potter's Bar, and niece of Captain Marryat, the
celebrated novelist. He died in London on Sept. 18th, 1870.</p>

<p><a name="A1548" id="A1548"></a><b>Young, James Henry</b>,
M.L.A., late Minister for Works, New South Wales, and ex-Speaker of
the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, in which he sits for
Hastings and Manning, was Minister of Public Instruction in the
last Robertson Ministry from Dec. 1885 to Feb. 1886. In March 1887
he was elected Speaker of the Assembly, and was re-elected in Feb.
1889. In Oct. 1890 he resigned. Mr. Young, who has represented his
present constituency since 1880, is the son of James Young by his
marriage with Maria Druce, and was born at Moor Court, Hampshire,
on May 15th, 1834. Mr. Young, who commenced life in the Peninsular
and Oriental Company's service, finally gave up seafaring for
commercial pursuits in 1853, arriving in Sydney in July 1859. He
was appointed Minister for Public Works in the Parkes Ministry in
August 1890, and held the post, in which he succeeded Mr. Bruce
Smith, until the retirement of the Cabinet in Oct. 1891. He married

<p><a name="A1549" id="A1549"></a><b>Younghusband, William</b>, was
one of the promoters of the Murray River Steam Navigation Company,
which enabled Captain Cadell in 1853 to win the £4000 bonus offered
by the Government of South Australia for the initiation of steam
communication on the Murray. Having represented Stanley in the
mixed Legislative Council for five years prior to the inauguration
of responsible government in 1856, he was elected to the new
Legislative Council, and was Chief Secretary in the Hanson
Government from Sept. 1857 to May 1860. This being the first stable
administration formed subsequent to the disappearance of the old
officials from public life, it fell to Mr. Younghusband to organise
the various Government departments inaugurated under the
new régime. This he did with consummate ability, and for many
years the public business of the colony was transacted on the lines
he laid down. Mr. Younghusband was a director of the Bank of
Australasia, and retired from the Legislative Council by rotation
in Feb. 1861. He died at Rome in May 1863.</p>

<p><a name="A1550" id="A1550"></a><b>Yuille, William Cross</b>, was
born at Cardross, Dumbartonshire on March 28th, 1819, and
after spending three years in the West India firm of Jas. Ewing
&amp; Co., in Glasgow, emigrated to Tasmania, where he arrived
in Dec. 1836. In February of the following year Mr. Yuille landed
with a flock of merino sheep, at Point Henry, near Geelong, in
the new settlement of Port Phillip. He took up a run at
Murgheballoak on the Barwon River, and formed one of the search
party organised to look for Messrs. Gellibrand and Hesse, who had
disappeared, and were afterwards ascertained to have been murdered
by the blacks. After doing much pioneering and exploration work in
various parts of what is now the colony of Victoria, Mr. Yuille, in
1838, removed to the Ballarat district; and two years
later, having sold his station there, went to New Zealand, where he
was present at the ceremony of taking possession of those islands
for the British Government by Governor Hobson, and the signing of
the memorable treaty of Waitangi. Returning to Victoria Mr.
Yuille embarked in squatting at Rockbank, on the Werribee
plains, occupying the country from within a few miles
of Williamstown to Mount Cotterell. There he owned and
trained a number of successful performers on the Victorian turf,
and after revisiting England several times, where he made fresh
purchases, he settled in Williamstown in 1885, and reared numerous
winners in his stables. Mr. Yuille was for many years one of the
foremost men on the Victorian turf, being one of the stewards of
the Jockey Club, handicapper to the Victoria Racing Club, and one
of the leading members of Tattersall's committee, until his
retirement in 1881. For six years he contributed to the
Australasian under the soubriquet "Peeping Tom," and is the
compiler of the "Australian Stud Book," which is recognised as the
standard work of reference throughout the Australasian
Colonies.</p>
