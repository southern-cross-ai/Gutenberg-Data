<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter 1&mdash;The Querril Set</h2>

<hr>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>When the Querrils first went to live at Chessilton Heath they
occupied one of the few houses scattered along the south side. The
village was an amorphous segregation of villadom and tin chapels,
turning its back on the heath. But some genius, foreseeing the
possibilities of the place, set to work and laid out a golf
course.</p>

<p>Now the result of this energy acted upon the interests of the
inhabitants either as a blessing or a curse, according to point of
view. For Chessilton Heath golf course became one of the best and
the club one of the most famous, throughout England; and the
village blossomed into an unbalanced but peculiarly vitalized town.
A famous member of the Government established his week-end quarters
near the golf club-house, and attracted around him a coterie of
friends and followers. A director of the railway company settled
there, and his presence insured an improved train service with
London. There arrived two editors of daily papers, a whisky magnate
who was also a patron of the arts, a famous playwright, several
lawyers, a reasonable number of actresses not living with their
husbands, and a crowd of people who were doing things in finance,
the motor industry, oil, art, and journalism. To these must be
added odd, mysterious people in the wake of the cabinet minister,
who lurked behind that jeremiad of activities which ululate at the
back of the political arena.</p>

<p>The golf club-house was a center of considerable social
activity, as well as the Dormy house, where members and their
friends could stay. There one could dine, smoke, drink, flirt, play
billiards, talk scandal, or promulgate schemes of social reform. On
many a glorious summer day one might peep into the "mixed room" and
observe mixed people playing bridge from early morning till late
evening. Golf at times threatened to become a Cinderella of more
adventurous games.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Querril family towards this social
development was somewhat similar to their attitude towards the
majority of abstract questions; that is to say, it was a
compromise. They professed a rather eclectic Bohemianism. They were
always outwardly deploring this upward thrust of fashion. They were
not fond of golf and seldom played. Nevertheless, Mr. Querril and
Martin&mdash;the eldest boy&mdash;both' joined the club and had
their names inscribed on little brass plates on lockers. This gave
the family certain rights and privileges. And much as they resented
the invasion of their adopted village, they delighted to meet new
people and to be friendly. Some one once asked Mr. Querril if he
were a socialist, and he replied:</p>

<p>"Yes. Or, in any case, I believe in the basis of socialism,
which is to be sociable."</p>

<p>And it was quite true. He was quite as genial, garrulous, and at
home in the drawing-room of a bishop as in the shop of the man
soling and heeling his boots. As a family, they dressed
badly&mdash;with the exception of Magda. Mr. Querril himself
dressed deplorably. But he could not conceal the fact that beneath
his badly fitting clothes, his square-toed boots, his soft collar,
and rather over-bunchy tie he was not only a gentleman, but what is
<i>considered</i> a gentleman&mdash;which is a very different and
more exclusive thing.</p>

<p>There was one matter upon which the Querril family would not
yield to any kind of social dictation. It concerned the decoration
of their home and the disposition of their household gods. They
possessed a few good pictures and several sound pieces of old
furniture, but their collection was for the most part an almost
incredibly ugly potpourri of mid-Victorian furniture, gimcrack
ornaments, and photographs. This bourgeois hotch-potch was not due
to an essential lack of taste&mdash;they were all keenly
appreciative of beauty in other people's homes; it was due entirely
to sentimental reasons. If some one vaguely hinted that a
particularly ugly chair might be removed from the morning-room,
Mrs. Querril would remark:</p>

<p>"I cannot let that go, darling. It belonged to my mother."</p>

<p>Nearly everything in the house had a sentimental association.
The mahogany dining-room suite, which Mr. and Mrs. Querril bought
when they were engaged (he was twenty-two and she was nineteen);
all their wedding presents; a black-and-gold writing-desk which "my
darling Susie gave me when she broke up her home after poor John's
death"; an ormolu clock which "Aunt Lena bought us at the Paris
Exhibition"; a terrible collection of pastels which were hung in
the drawing-room for no more excusable reason than that they were
perpetrated by Cousin Mildred. And then the photographs! They
snapped up every available spare foot in the house. Enlargements of
Mr. and Mrs. Querril in a wedding group, photographs of Mr. Querril
when he was a Cambridge undergraduate, photographs of Mrs. Querril
holding Magda in her arms, photographs of Magda and Evelyn
together, in stiff print frocks; of Martin and Rodney in cricket
flannels, of Peter in a velvet suit, standing on a chair; Magda
with her hair up, Magda as she appeared for a fancy-dress dance, a
family group taken on the tennis lawn. There were photographs in
white frames, in oak frames, in mahogany frames. They flooded the
staircases and even found their way into the bathrooms.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>It may appear irregular to describe people's furniture before
describing the people themselves, but do we not, in effect, usually
found our introductions in this indirect way? And how many people
are there, of whom we know only the furniture, the clothes, the
manners, and the physical phenomena which hem them in? The rest may
require the association of a lifetime or the covers of many stout
volumes.</p>

<p>It is, in any case, not inappropriate to approach the Querril
mind through the vicarious attitude of photographs and moribund
heirlooms, for this aspect of them was not confined to the
trappings of their physical existence but influenced their manners
and entire mental outlook. A stranger had to fight his or her way
through a bewildering manifestation of petty and unaccountable
actions and accidents. Indeed, one had to live with them to
perceive the many fine skeins of this emotional and sentimental
quality which was woven into the fabric of their united lives. They
were intensely but quite unconsciously sentimental. In theory they
professed to abhor sentimentality. They derided it in novels or
plays. They were simply blind to the extent of it in which they
were saturated themselves. They were unselfish to an almost
abnormal degree. They lived so much for each other, thought so much
about each other, were so dynamically, frenziedly, unrelentingly
unselfish, that the thing was always defeating its own ends. Each
member of the family had little peculiarities and fads which had
been discovered with great pains by other members, and then
encouraged and catered to. There was a scrupulous endeavor to see
that, though every one was loved and fussed over exceedingly,
including all their relatives and the people who came to the house,
no one was loved or fussed over more than any one else. The result
of this bred a kind of impersonalism. They became less like a
community of individuals than an atmosphere of love and
good-fellowship.</p>

<p>The visitor, indeed, who came to this very open house sometimes
found it difficult not only to find his way through the photographs
and furniture and then to differentiate between the members of the
family, but even to determine who were Querrils and who weren't.
The house was in a constant state of flux. Matters were also a
little complicated by the fact that their friends and next-door
neighbors, the Lemaires, were nearly always with them, and the two
Lemaire girls, Annette and Joan, were about the same age as Magda
and Evelyn. Mrs. Lemaire was a charming Frenchwoman, who had lived
for twenty-seven years in England and still spoke English with a
very broken accent. One reason for this may have been that no one
helped her to improve her English, and in fact her daughters
frankly encouraged her mistakes. They seemed unable to get over the
charm of their mother. They would kneel on the grass at her feet
and listen to her, and when she made some outrageous slip they
would laugh with delight and clap their hands, and Madame Lemaire
would say:</p>

<p>"Have I said something wrong?"</p>

<p>And then either Annette or Joan would kiss her, and say:</p>

<p>"No, darling. You talk like an angel."</p>

<p>Mr. Lemaire, who only came down for weekends, was a naval
engineer. He was a tall, straight-limbed person, very Saxon, fair,
clear of eye, somewhat reserved but studiously courteous, with a
certain charm of manner not characteristically Saxon. And there was
one Lemaire boy, Cecil, who was at Charterhouse.</p>

<p>The Querrils and the Lemaires formed the nucleus of a fluid
state of social intercourse which had its headquarters on the
Querril tennis court, or in Peter's studio, and which began to be
known at that time as "the Querril set."</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>That fortunate visitor we have spoken of, who may have made a
prolonged visit as a guest of the Querril family, must soon have
arrived at certain very definite conclusions. For instance, one may
postulate that all men are equal, that love is impartial, that
self-abnegation is the greatest of all virtues; but this visitor,
perhaps half-dozing between the crisp white sheets in the little
spare bedroom overlooking the cherry-tree (the birds <i>always</i>
had all the cherries), may have been suddenly brought face to face
with the realization that Mother Nature detests all these premises
in the same way that she is reputed to abhor a vacuum. She wants to
get on with her job, and unselfishness doesn't make babies, love is
above all things partial, and self-abnegation has no place in the
fields or heavens. What does that brazen demi-monde the sunflower
care about the contortions of the ridiculous convolvulus?...</p>

<p>And so to this semi-sleeper there must have come a realization
that beneath this bold bid for a universal mind and communion of
love there still stirred the old pulse of primordial expression,
little currents and cross-currents constantly breaking away from
the main stream; above all, the unquenchable fires of
individuality. In the first place, there were two&mdash;if not
three&mdash;members of the family who quite unwittingly stood out
from the rest. One could not think of the Querril family without
instinctively thinking of Magda first. It may have been partly
because Magda was undeniably beautiful, the only member of the
family of whom the claim could be made; but it was not only that,
for Magda's beauty was one of those affairs of poise and glow
without which all beauty is so much tinsel. Everybody told their
troubles to Magda&mdash;a most dangerous quality to have. She had
masses of light-brown hair, which had a way of catching the sun in
little golden glints. Her skin was pale, almost olive in repose,
but it glowed with a delicate warmth in action&mdash;and Magda was
always in action, either physically or mentally. The face was round
and rather broad, the brown eyes always searching for sympathy and
giving more in return. She had a peculiarly beautiful neck and
chin, and a way of holding herself which invited all your
attention. You had to tell her everything, and hold her hand in the
process, and perhaps walk with her slowly up and down the lawn; and
afterwards you had to wonder what Magda would think of this and
that. She quite unconsciously became the pivot of the Querril
family, because of this insistent appeal of her personality, and
the fact that she was always in action.</p>

<p>Evelyn, her younger sister, had Magda's atmosphere, but she was
less finely modeled. It was as though the sculptor had set out to
do something even finer and subtler than Magda, but the subtlety
had been overdone and the result was rather nebulous. She had What
was called a pretty effect, but an effect somewhat disappointing on
analysis. She was the youngest member of the family, openly
sentimental, and more than any of the others perhaps a chartered
embodiment of Querril foibles.</p>

<p>Next to Magda, Peter, the youngest boy, had the most pronounced
individuality. He was shorter and stockier than either of his
brothers; a grinning, jolly boy with a square chin and a mop of
brown hair; always good-tempered and the butt of endless jokes, but
with an eye that was not only humorous but reflective. Given to
long silences and cryptic and surprising phrases, he differed from
the others in many respects. Peter on occasions even lost his
temper, and of course he was the favorite of his mother. (Heavens!
she would never have acknowledged it!) He was nineteen at that
time, and destined to become a landscape painter. He had a studio
at the top of the house, which was also used as a music and games
room by the rest of the family on occasions.</p>

<p>Martin and Rodney were twenty-six and twenty-five respectively.
Martin was a singular counterpart of his father. He was angular and
very plain. He had the same kind brown eyes and genial manners. He
was equally shortsighted, and wore thick glasses, and made the same
atrocious puns. Also he helped his father in business, which was
that of a publisher of works of reference.</p>

<p>Rodney had the reputation of representing the intellectual side
of the family. He was better-looking than either Martin or Peter;
tall, very thin, with something a little languid and distinguished
about his air. He spoke well at times, and his jokes were less
trite and his opinions more formed. He had just emerged from his
pupil-ship to Sir John Ashbingham, the well-known architect in
Lincoln's Inn Fields, and had taken an office in Grey's Inn. Rodney
was the only member of the family interested in social matters,
though he had persuaded both Martin and Peter to assist him with
work at the Treves Settlement at Hammersmith, concerning the
activities of which we shall hear more later on.</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>It would be idle to pretend that tennis at the Querrils' ever
reached a high standard of proficiency. No one played particularly
well, and there was not infrequently a hardly concealed conspiracy
to let the other side win, especially when Magda was playing in a
set against "George," as all the family called Mr. Querril. But the
garden was delightful, and the lawn sunk between three grass
embankments, the highest being on the house-side, with little
circular beds of standard roses; and here Mrs. Querril would
preside, like a figure of Perpetuity, in a solid wicker chair,
surrounded by needlework which always occupied her hands but not
her eyes, and novels which she never read, and glittering
tea-things, and a wire-haired terrier called Potash, and
occasionally the more elusive Perlmutter&mdash;a slim brown
spaniel, who was, however, more frequently away on some active
business concerning rabbit-holes, on the east side of the
heath.</p>

<p>And to Mrs. Querril, this was the world, and there was no other.
Or if there was another world, it existed only by reflection
through the eyes of George, and Magda, Evelyn, Martin, Rodney, and
Peter. She concealed beneath her placid eyes and gentle smile an
attitude towards her husband and children that combined some of the
qualities of an early Christian martyr with those of a Bengal
tigress towards its cubs. She was always alert, watchful,
intuitive, and blindly self-effacing.</p>

<p>In the evenings, or when the weather was bad, they would all
foregather in Peter's studio, where there was a baby-grand. And
there they would either play outrageous games or listen to good
music. Magda played the piano well and was something of a musician,
and Peter was no mean executant on the 'cello. Martin played the
violin with sufficient technique of a rather scrambling sort to
justify the idea of trios. And occasionally Joan Lemaire would sing
German <i>lieder</i> in a rigid soprano. Under the spell of the
most mysterious and intriguing of the muses, the Querril family
would cluster in little groups. And so harmonious, so reposeful, so
inarticulate, would they appear, that they themselves resembled the
strings of some old instrument as yet unplayed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter 2&mdash;The Rainbow</h2>

<hr>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>It was a Saturday afternoon in June. Mr. Querril, usually the
most sociable of men, nipped out of the train at Chessilton Heath
station and darted across the platform. With the casual nod of the
well-known "season" holder to the ticket collector, he made for the
path by the side of the station without looking round. His short
sight was on occasions a great asset to him when he wanted to avoid
people, and on this day he was particularly anxious to be alone for
the twenty minutes' walk to the house. When faced with any
disturbing problem he had great faith in those old
panaceas&mdash;solitude and exercise.</p>

<p>His old blue coat bulged with periodicals and rolls of
manuscript, whilst his long arms and bony fingers clutched further
books, and rolls, and brown-paper parcels. The shabby gray felt cap
was pulled down over his eyes, and one trouser was turned up at the
bottom and the other not. It was one of his most successful
attempts to pose as a vagabond. It was, indeed, only the eyes which
betrayed him, and from them emanated a spirit not only of a great
kindliness and gentleness but a certain distress and
apprehension.</p>

<p>He hurried along until he arrived at the second field on the
short cut across Mr. Catteral's farm, and then he dumped all his
parcels on the ground and sat on the stile and lighted his pipe. It
was very hot, and bees hummed in the young clover. Overhead an
invisible lark was singing entrancingly. It was very delightful
after town. Very delightful and pleasant to get away from the great
city, where he was afraid things were not always like this; where
there was suffering, dishonesty, malice&mdash;just to step out here
so simply, and feel the fresh air, and to see the green fields and
the gray distances, to walk up the lane to the house, and then to
be greeted by love and laughter; to wash and change into flannels,
and then to sit about among the roses or under the pergola, and to
watch the children play tennis; to talk to his friends and discuss
the latest books, to hear the merry quips and bantering of young
people all dressed in white, with healthy, glowing faces.</p>

<p>The philosophic processes which had gone to the making of Mr.
Querril's "sanctuary" in those early years of the twentieth century
had followed upon certain fluid and not unpopular lines. Mr.
Querril considered himself an intensely modern man, alive to every
social and religious development, and quite open-minded. The only
son of well-to-do parents who lavished upon him every care, and
left him well educated on conventional Anglican lines, and well
provided for; the inheritor of a solid and interesting business;
something of a dreamer, with a passion for things intellectual for
their own sake, never swayed by any impulse that he could not
control, child-like in his affections and beliefs, he slipped into
the toga of this pleasant family life almost imperceptibly to
himself. It seemed a perfectly natural costume to him, and anything
else was almost unthinkable. Poverty, misery, and vice distressed
him unspeakably, and he had long ago decided that the problems
concerning them were unsolvable. He treated the human race as he
treated his own family&mdash;a body to be controlled by suggestion
and "atmosphere."</p>

<p>In religion he called himself a Rationalist, and none of the
children had had any religious training, but it was open to them if
they cared to take it. They had been educated partly by a sequence
of governesses and bland tutors, and partly at Benningdales' which,
as you know, is a famous school for coeducation and modern ideas In
politics he compromised with various wavering tendencies, and voted
Liberal. The children at this time had taken little interest in
politics, with the exception of Rodney, who was ragged by the
others on account of his Fabian tendencies. We say "ragged"
advisedly, because it was a tradition of the family to discuss
flippantly the things that mattered, and seriously the things that
didn't matter. The question of the color of a piece of embroidery
for Evelyn's djibbah would lead almost to a white-hot feud, but any
problem which concerned fundamental emotions was either ignored or
passed over facetiously. The reason of this was obvious. Somebody's
feelings might be hurt.</p>

<p>Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Querril had ever put any restraints upon
the children at all. Neither had they sought to instil into them
any concrete conception of their place or purpose in life. During
the years of adolescence they had watched them at times with
anxiety and made attempts to co-ordinate their moral and mental
outlook. But this was done more by example and suggestion than by
instruction. They relied an atmosphere. And indeed the atmosphere
of the Querrils might have made a sinner into a saint. During this
period the boys called their father "George," but he told them
nothing. During this period the girls called their mother
"darling," and she replied, "My darling Magda," and "My darling
Evie," and she kissed them good night.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>And it had all been justified. They were splendid children. They
had passed the most dangerous period. Mr. Querril had never thought
or contended that these things didn't matter. What he contended to
himself was that they mattered little, so long as children lived up
to a moral code, that they were healthy, clean-minded and
unselfish. And all his children were this.</p>

<p>Moreover, they were clever, on the threshold of great things.
The boys would do better than he had done. This modern education
was broadening every one. How much freer and happier this young
generation was than his own had been! They seemed to get about
more, to understand more. There was that settlement where the boys
worked...</p>

<p>And then Mr. Querril felt again that little stab of disquiet
which had marred this pleasant day. He looked down at his parcels
and sucked the stem of his pipe. The trouble had been this:</p>

<p>Rodney was the moving spirit at the Settlement. It was an
undertaking he took very seriously; consequently it was very little
discussed at home. The boys would sometimes give an amusing
description of some old lady who came there, or an imitation of the
way the people talked. Mr. Querril did not really know what their
activities amounted to, except that they worked amongst the poor on
the river-side at Hammersmith, and each boy gave up so much of his
time. The previous summer Rodney had rescued a youth named
Stallard, when his father, a widower, had been sent to prison for
seven years for forgery. They had found him work in Mr. Querril's
office. He was a quiet, sallow-faced boy, rather pink round the
eyes. He showed quickness and adaptability. But at the end of three
months he was caught stealing a postal order for twenty-four
shillings, from Mr. Querril's drawer. The owner was much
distressed. He lectured the boy in halting sentences, expressing
his sorrow, feverishly "suggesting" that he would be wiser and
happier not to do such things, and then sent him back to his work.
Six weeks after that he stole the pocket-book of Mr. John Frisby,
the head clerk, and was again detected. There was very nearly a
climax over that, as Mr. Querril was not there at the time, and Mr.
Frisby was all in favor of giving the boy in charge. However,
excited conversations over the telephone ended in Master Stallard
being once more forgiven.</p>

<p>But that morning things had reached a definite pass. A valuable
old book on Byzantine architecture, which had been missing for some
weeks, had been found by a police inspector in a secondhand shop in
Notting Hill, and the bookseller had given a description of the lad
who sold it to him which tallied identically with that of young
Stallard. It was perhaps characteristic of Mr. Querril that, on
listening to the details from the police inspector, a minor fact
impressed him more potently than the major fact. The bookseller had
given the lad fifteen shillings for it. Now, Mr. Querril had paid
twenty-seven pounds for that volume many years ago, and it would be
worth more now. The bookseller was also not an honest man. But he
was protected by a code; the boy had no protection. It was very
puzzling and distracting. The police inspector was greedy for a
conviction, and Mr. Querril was in a position he hated&mdash;that
of having to make up his mind. He humm'd and ha'd. His son would
have to be consulted (Martin never went up to the office on
Saturdays). And during these moments of equivocation there arose in
Mr. Querril an antipathy to the police inspector's face. It flashed
through his mind that he had observed the same expression on the
face of Perlmutter when watching a rabbit hole. Tolerable in a dog,
but disgusting in a man.</p>

<p>"I could forgive anything except cruelty," he had remarked
suddenly, with no relevance to the case in hand that the inspector
could see.</p>

<p>No definite decision had been arrived at, and Mr. Querril bad
promised to deal with it during the ensuing week. He made his usual
Saturday purchases of chocolates, knick-knacks and magazines, and
caught his customary train.</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>And now he sat, a helpless figure amidst his problems and his
parcels. What <i>could</i> one do for a boy like young Stallard?
What earthly purpose would it serve to send him to prison or to a
reformatory? With such a hereditary taint, what chance had the
wretched boy? What would Rodney think? It seemed somehow ungrateful
and inept on his own part not to have made more of the boy that
Rodney had sent him.</p>

<p>He picked up a parcel of stuffed dates&mdash;for which Evelyn
and Peter had a great fondness-and the "Fortnightly Review," and
tucked them under his arm with the rest. Then he continued his
walk. A breezy neighbor passed him, clattering a bag of golf
clubs.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Querril!" he called out.</p>

<p>Mr. Querril had not observed him. He turned and pressed the
other's arm, and muttered:</p>

<p>"My dear good fellow!"</p>

<p>In the process he dropped the box of stuffed dates. He groped
for them and murmured something about the heat. He seemed
disinclined to pursue the conversation to any profounder depths,
and went on his way.</p>

<p>He walked quietly up the gravel drive to the house, and let
himself in. He could hear laughter in the garden, and Magda's voice
calling out:</p>

<p>"Forty-fifteen. Now, Roddies, do serve decently."</p>

<p>He put down his parcels and went up to the bedroom and shut the
door. Then he tiptoed across the room and peeped out at the window.
Yes, they were all there. Rodney and Magda and the two Lemaire
girls were playing tennis. His wife was sitting in her cane chair,
sewing and talking to Mrs. Lemaire and a very stout man. Martin was
lying fiat on his back, looking up through the mulberry tree and
chewing a straw. Peter was perched on the bank at the end of the
lawn, sketching in a diminutive sketch-book. Potash was sleeping
tranquilly in an apparently perilous position. He was tucked right
underneath the deck chair of the fat man. The shade there was
undoubtedly effective, but the flimsy nature of its structure
appeared totally inadequate to support the immense proportions of
the sitter. If anything happened, it seemed horrible to think what
might be the fate of the faithful Potash.</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>It is further characteristic of Mr. Querril that in that moment,
still smarting under the stress of his morning's experience, he
enjoyed a little glow of satisfaction in realizing that the man was
Decimus Postern. A love of celebrities was one of the little
feathered vanities in the family quiver. Decimus Postern was a very
old friend of the family, but Mr. Querril could never get over the
pleasurable sound of the phrase, "My friend Decimus Postern." And
Decimus at that time was by no means a figure to be overlooked or
ignored. Creatures other than Potash were pleased to bask in his
shadow. He was a celebrity in the world of letters, without having
ever accomplished any work which justified a unique position. He
had attained it rather by weight of personality than by any
original, creative ability. He was one of those people who take
stage center by sheer bulk. Of vast dimensions, with a babyish face
and large protruding eyes which looked out indulgently on the
passing phenomena of existence, he adapted his person adroitly to
an eighteen-sixty effect&mdash;with voluminous peg-top trousers, an
embroidered waistcoat hanging in pendulous lines over his
protruding front, a heavy black stock bound many times around a
Gladstonian collar, and a tortoise-shell monocle in his left eye.
His dark curly gray hair was going thin at the top, and when he
laughed in his high tenor the great bags of flesh on his cheeks and
neck shook and glowed, and the all-too-eager tears started from his
eyes and added to the general humidity of his appearance. There was
about him something attractively fantastic, as though some ironic
alchemist among the gods had invented a thing that was neither
spirit nor matter, but an adventitious composite of the two,
retaining all the most nebulous qualities of the one with the most
assertive, pornographic characteristics of the other.</p>

<p>At meal times he would eat voraciously, indiscriminately, but
without any apparent sensual enjoyment; and during and between the
mouthfuls quiver in his light tones of the beauty of Celtic
twilight poetry, the curse of the Renaissance, the imagery of
Persian sagas. Little whimsies and epigrams fell from his lips like
leaves from an autumn oak, not in themselves of particular point or
significance but transcended by the <i>ignis fatuus</i> of his
personality. Opinions and epigrams were attributed to him for which
he was frequently not responsible. One had only to know Decimus
Postern to realize how many of the ancient myths originated.</p>

<p>Some one once asked Peter what he thought of him, and he
replied: "He's too moist."</p>

<p>And there was more in this than its purely material application.
Decimus was fluid. He flowed on and on. He was not so much a
creative artist as a medium for mental liquid. Thoughts, ideas, and
cunning arrangements of words poured through him. Words, words,
words. He loved the play of them, the interplay, their fecundity,
the power they had of eternally suggesting new and pregnant
combinations. His works consisted mostly of anthologies, and little
volumes founded on some phase of life suggested by the works of a
long-forgotten poet or romanticist Among the irreverent of Fleet
Street he was known as a "paste-and-scissors" artist It was rumored
that in those comfortable offices of his on Adelphi Terrace lie
employed a small staff of bright young men, who spent their lives
excavating and card-indexing. He certainly produced a goodly number
of volumes for one who spent so much time sitting in the Querrils'
garden, or taking the chair at interminable dinners. He lived a
capacious bachelor's life in an old house that had been modernized
by Lutyens, not a hundred yards from the Querrils', at Chessilton
Heath. The interior was a combination of Versailles and an old
Somerset farmhouse. It was filled with beautiful things often
inappropriately placed. He lived, attended by an octogenarian
housekeeper who was toothless, a pompous, middle-aged butler with
the air of a permanent official, and a fugitive staff of odd cooks
and housemaids. He entertained considerably and was enormously
popular. And when everything had been given and everything taken
away from the character of Decimus Postern, it was generally agreed
that he was a very lovable person.</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>When Mr. Querril had donned a white alpaca coat, and been
received into the family group with the usual acclamations, and
been kissed by Ms wife, and given a chair by Evelyn, and disturbed
Potash, the tennis set proceeded. The reedy voice of Decimus
engaged in a bantering argument with Mrs. Lemaire acted as a kind
of soporific. How different this all seemed to London, where there
was sometimes "suffering, dishonesty, malice "! It would be
difficult to talk to Rodney about young Stallard. It would have to
be done, but he would bide his time...</p>

<p>"Nature, dear lady," Postern was saying. "What greater bore is
there than Nature? Fancy taking millions of years to evolve a
turnip! It was not till, as a last desperate resource, she started
making men and women that she began to turn out anything
interesting at all. And even then the interest usually centers
round the efforts of men and women to defy Nature, than with the
humdrum efforts of Nature herself. Imagine the world without art,
without cathedrals, without drama, without charity, or the fine
frenzy to die for an ideal, and you have Nature&mdash;utterly
exposed. She has certain silly notions about hygiene and physical
attraction, but absolutely no discrimination between realism and
idealism."</p>

<p>And then the musical voice of Mrs. Lemaire:</p>

<p>"O-oh, <i>you</i>! You do talk such ru-beesh! Are not men and
vimen nature?"</p>

<p>Mr. Querril smiled. An adorable woman, Mrs. Lemaire; clever too.
Dear old Decimus, how amusing he was! Quite insincere, of course.
At least, generally so. But with a heart of gold. Oh, well played,
Magda! A fine shot! What is Perlmutter doing among those young
cabbages? Dear me! a lot of dead shoots among the roses already.
To-morrow morning he must come out with the scissors and
basket...</p>

<p>Mr. Querril is destined to be a listener. Tea is brought out on
a silver tray, and placed on an Indian collapsible stand of
sandalwood. The tennis is finished. Evelyn is rolling Peter down
the bank because she discovers that he has already found the
stuffed dates and has eaten most of them. He is yelling out: "Help!
Murder! Fire! Thieves!" The other boys have put on blazers and
scarfs and are handing round cakes. Potash is very much awake, and
Perlmutter has made a belated appearance. And over the tea-cups
they laugh and chat, and the time-honored jest of some one accusing
Mr. Querril of flirting with Mrs. Lemaire is met by his reply,
which surprises himself more than any one:</p>

<p>"Well, why should I be the only one left out?"</p>

<p>He is in good humor after that, and they break up into little
groups. Decimus, Rodney, himself, drift upstairs to see a new
painting of Peter's, and there he hears another discussion,
somewhat illuminating. It comes about through Peter having had the
audacity to paint a rainbow (a very faint rainbow touching a
distant hill). And Decimus remarks:</p>

<p>"To be candid, I never can admire a rainbow. A silly alchemist's
trick swung across the sky as though some one had been tampering
with nature. A landscape become divorced from all sensibility. One
instinctively wonders how it's done."</p>

<p>"There are rainbows and rainbows," mutters Peter.</p>

<p>"That's just it," adds Rodney. "A rainbow looks best, in my
opinion, above a city. It wants a factory or a railway junction,
somewhere where there's a lot of grime and dirt. The chimneys might
have had something to do with the manufacture of it. In any case it
strikes a grotesque note, and a city is no good without the
grotesque to help it. A mass of gray uniformity, and then little
discords and vivid reflections in unexpected places."</p>

<p>"Can any one tell me why it always looks so sentimental above a
cathedral or a church?" asks Martin, who has just joined them.</p>

<p>"It was God's promise," says Peter, and they all laugh, giving
Decimus the opportunity of cutting in with:</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, it looks well above a city because a city
is itself grotesque. One can't look at a herd of people living
together under grotesque conditions without wondering how
<i>that's</i> done."</p>

<p>"It's the rainbow which explains how it's done," continues
Rodney. "The white light of the sun appears inexplicable, and then
the rainbow comes dancing through a prism formed by the clouds and
shows you exactly how the white light is composed. And it's the
same with a people. The herd appears inexplicable, but When you
look at it through a prism you find it's composed of green, blue,
violet, orange, and yellow individuals."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, tell me how you look at a herd through a
prism."</p>

<p>"Oh, there are all sorts of prisms. Come down to our settlement
one day, Dess, and we'll show you some."</p>

<p>Peter and Martin laugh, and the large man breathes heavily.
Peter digs his thumb into his ribs, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"I'd love to see Dess at the Settlement! Fancy him sympathizing
with Mrs. Stilling and her ailments! or trying to persuade old Ben
Cotton not to throw flat-irons at his wife on Saturday
evenings!"</p>

<p>"Or," echoes Martin, "taking a dozen bundles of firewood under
his arm to the Troons!"</p>

<p>(Who on earth are all these people?...So this is what my boys
do...)</p>

<p>But Decimus is shaking his fat forefinger.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute! Wait a minute! This is getting too involved. Is
the white light of the sun any better because I see it explained in
a rainbow? or the herd because I&mdash;am disgusted with it in
detail?"</p>

<p>"Don't be flippant, Dess. It's a question of the ultimate
good."</p>

<p>"Very well, then; I contend that I'm doing more good by writing
good verse, or a critique of a bad novel, than by carrying bundles
of wood to a thriftless charwoman."</p>

<p>"But suppose her thriftlessness, as you call it, were due to
conditions for which we are all responsible? What would you
do?"</p>

<p>"Leave her alone."</p>

<p>"And in the meantime&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"In the meantime, people are being born. They're eating,
drinking, dying, making love, making fools of themselves; but,
broadly speaking&mdash;making progress."</p>

<p>"And why are they making progress? Because some one at some time
has not let them alone. Because people whom you despise as
interferers have butted in, made themselves unpopular, and got
their way. Everybody who has done anything, from Jesus Christ to
Lloyd George, has been described as a busybody and a meddler at
some time. People don't want to be reformed. They hate it. The rich
don't want to be taxed in the interests of the poor. There wouldn't
be any taxation of this sort at all if certain fanatics hadn't
taken the matter up and got themselves intensely disliked. At the
present time we are enjoying the advantages of laws, institutions,
and privileges to gain which hundreds of meddlers and interferers
have been stoned."</p>

<p>(Interfere! Yes...but how? What about the boy Stallard?)</p>

<p>Decimus is preparing an avalanche to destroy this plausible
philosophy, when Magda enters the room. She is wearing an old green
shawl. She puts her arm round her father's shoulders, and says:</p>

<p>"Are you boys coming? We're going for a stroll on the
heath."</p>

<p>"Gracious lady," exclaims Decimus, "we know Why you wear that
shawl. It is not because a warm summer's evening justifies it, but
because it makes you appear adorable."</p>

<p>"Really! Do I need a <i>shawl</i> for that?"</p>

<p>"Heavens, forgive me! What a suggestion! And now please tell us.
Where does a rainbow look best?"</p>

<p>It is necessary for Magda to walk to the window, to torture this
large creature with her pensive beauty, before she replies:</p>

<p>"Out on the open heath."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter 3&mdash;Sleepy Eyes With
Corybantic Depths</h2>

<hr>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The problem of "interference" exercised the mind of Mr. Querril
on Sunday morning when he was pruning the roses. Was Rodney right?
It was a very big question. He inherited a faith in liberty,
freedom, "self-determination," leaving people alone. <i>He</i> had
never interfered. And yet&mdash;what was he doing now? If he didn't
interfere with the roses they would die, or in any case be very
poor specimens. Who were the Troons? He had heard the boys refer to
the Troons on several occasions. He believed that Mr. Troon was a
dreadful man, a kind of hooligan. Did Rodney interfere with him?
And there was a daughter. She seemed to cause considerable
discussion. The boys said she was beautiful. It is more dangerous
to interfere with a beautiful girl than with a hooligan father. Had
Rodney done any good by interfering with young Stallard? It was so
ingrained in Mr. Querril to believe in every one, to trust every
one, and most especially his children, that he would feel too
sensitive even to discuss such matters. Every one had to work out
his own salvation. His children could do no wrong. Experience was
the racial cathartic. That this coming generation was going to be a
generation of interferers, was quite evident. Perhaps they were
right, perhaps they were wrong. His children called him George, to
try to make him one of them; to make him feel younger than he was.
It was an engaging piece of flattery, but quite unconvincing. A
father can never be entirely intimate with his children. There must
always be that frozen multitude of years between them, a barrier of
solidified experiences. But these young people who were coming
up&mdash;men and women, especially women&mdash;they were so much
more articulate than they had been in his day. It was as though a
dumb man, who had spent his life thinking, had suddenly found his
voice. It was interesting for him to watch and listen&mdash;yes,
that was all he could do now, listen.</p>

<p>"Aristotle's 'political animal,'" thought Mr. Querril, "has been
stodged for so long on a diet of materialism and Bourbonism that
the result has produced a kind of spiritual flatulence." Mr.
Querril smiled. He was intensely pleased with himself for thinking
of this phrase. It was not one he could repeat to the family. It
wasn't quite nice. But it was very pleasant to wander round the
garden on Sunday morning, with his pipe and scissors, before the
family were up. (They came down at most outrageous hours,
commencing with Magda about ten and ending up with Peter about
twelve-thirty.) The garden was never so beautiful as in the early
morning. The leaves glittered with little pearls of dew, and the
birds were so busy, and pleasant and beautiful thoughts came to
one. And his wife (they always breakfasted together at half-past
eight) would come out for a few moments and rest her hand on his
forearm, and say:</p>

<p>"You're not getting your feet wet, are you, dear?" or, "Do you
know whether Carters' has sent those delphinium seeds, my
love?"</p>

<p>And occasionally Ptolemy the Second would amble nonchalantly
across the lawn.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Ptolemy the Second was a large, black, half-Persian cat. Alone
among the whole of "the Querril set," he lived a thoroughly
detached, preoccupied existence. Unsociable, insolently beautiful,
an egoist from the end of his vibrant tail to the tip of his claws,
he showed a supreme indifference to men or beasts. The whole of the
Querril family and their attendants might vanish in the night, and
he would not turn one of his glossy hairs, provided that other
hands placed bowls of milk and rich and succulent foods in
convenient places at regular intervals. He mixed very little with
the family; indeed, he preferred the kitchen quarters, where there
was greater heat, and also a generously built cook, who had a
reasonable sense of her responsibilities to his royal demands. And
she did not fuss. Ptolemy the Second detested fuss. He gave the
impression that he selected the servants' quarter not for
democratic reasons but because he considered that the Querrils were
no better than their servants. They were a fussy, bourgeois crowd,
and Ptolemy was an aristocrat of aristocrats, a snob of snobs. He
toiled not, neither did he mouse. He did absolutely nothing. And
yet he knew that, so irresistible was his beauty, so sure his sense
of natural superiority, that nothing could be denied him.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would go and sit on the low stone parapet under the
pergola, his large chest stuck out, his eyes shut, and his
magnificent mustaches glistening in the sun. At such times, Magda
or Evelyn, utterly seduced by his beauty, would throw their arms
round his neck, and, burying their faces in his soft fur,
exclaim:</p>

<p>"Oh, you beautiful darling!"</p>

<p>Just a little of this he would tolerate, courteously but
unresponsively. A little more, and he would put back his ears and
draw away, with an expression which plainly said:</p>

<p>"<i>Really</i> you know! We Ptolemies, who ruled in
Egypt&mdash;or was it Persia?&mdash;centuries before this wretched
island was discovered&mdash;we don't do that sort of thing!"</p>

<p>If the matter was carried any further after that, he would
simply spring gracefully out of sight. His contempt for the dogs
was almost theatrical. It was overdone. He never even glanced at
them. He despised the way they were always working themselves up
into a state of nervous excitement over the actions of these
ridiculous, two-legged creatures. Perlmutter, evidently profiting
by some early and misguided experience, always gave Ptolemy a very
wide berth, but Potash would occasionally, in sheer excess of
vitality, perform some clownish antic. Ptolemy would treat the
inanity with the contempt it deserved ( still not even deigning to
look at him ) but if by any mischance he should carry the thing to
the extent of actual contact, there would be a sudden and terrible
change come over the scene. This soft and seductive lump of
tranquillity would in a flash appear a vast black ball, glittering
with teeth, claws, and green lightning. Through the menacing
turmoil would come a sound like a sneeze, or the kiss of some
portentous doom. The thing was beyond Potash. He was a plain dog,
used to straight fighting, and he had no use for the black arts of
Egypt. He simply bolted.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the only member of the family for whom Ptolemy
showed the slightest predilection was Mr. Querril himself. It was
probably because he never attempted to stroke him. He used to talk
to Ptolemy, and ask his opinion about gardening, and Ptolemy would
come quite near and blink at him and seem to say:</p>

<p>"You're not a bad old chap. Rather queer, perhaps, but you don't
fuss or interfere. There's just a touch of the East about
you&mdash;not very much, but enough to make you less intolerable
than the others."</p>

<p>And Mr. Querril would adjust his glasses, and say:</p>

<p>"Dear me, Ptolemy, what <i>are</i> we to do about this
green-fly? We tried Killall last year, but it was quite
useless."</p>

<p>And the yellow eyes of Ptolemy would narrow to a thin slit. He
would seem to be looking into space, as though the only answer to
such a useless question could be:</p>

<p>"In the East we leave things alone."</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Tennis went on intermittently all day on Sunday. And in the
afternoon promiscuous people dropped in, some to play and others to
talk. It was just before lunch that Mr. Querril keyed himself up to
tell Rodney about young Stallard. The interview was less
distressing than he anticipated. His second son took the matter
philosophically. They were in the nursery garden, whither Mr.
Querril had lured him, for the expressed purpose of devising a more
satisfactory protection for strawberries than old tennis nets full
of holes.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," Rodney said. "I hope it isn't bothering
you, Father."</p>

<p>(When the boys called him "Father," it meant that both sides
were reaching that embarrassing stage of self-consciousness when
they would be glad to escape from each other.)</p>

<p>"For God's sake don't give him in charge," he added, "or fire
him. If you can manage to keep him going for a week...we'll see
what we can do...I should think a couple of posts here, with some
of that wire netting that's in the tool-shed. We could cut out a
lot of this stuff then. What do you think?"</p>

<p>Nothing more was said to Mr. Querril about the matter, but
Rodney called Martin and Peter into his bedroom, and said:</p>

<p>"Blast that young Stallard! He's broken out again."</p>

<p>And Martin said: "I knew he would. It's inevitable. You've only
got to look at his face. He'll have to go to a home."</p>

<p>"A home!" echoed Rodney, mournfully. "The very word is a
travesty. Do you know what those homes are like? They're places
where boys are encouraged to think that they're criminals. A kind
of clearing-house for hell."</p>

<p>"We must find a decent home."</p>

<p>"I wish we knew of one. By the way, Pedro, did that girl, Emma
Troon, come to the flat on Friday?"</p>

<p>Peter laughed lightly.</p>

<p>"Yes. What is she? She doesn't look English."</p>

<p>"No, it's rather rum. Both her parents are hopelessly English,
her mother of the whining, charlady type, and her father a savage,
an ex-seaman and stone-mason, always fighting, drinking, and
throwing furniture about."</p>

<p>Martin laughed and seized Rodney by the lapels of the coat.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," he said, "yon don't mean to tell me yon
trusted Peter to be alone in the Pig-sty when Emma Troon
called!"</p>

<p>"I know it was madness, but I not only trusted him but I deputed
him to engage her to go there in the mornings to keep the place
decent."</p>

<p>The Pig-sty was a tiny flat owned by the Querrils in
Westminster. It consisted of four small rooms and a kitchen. There
was a double bed in one room, a single in another room, and a couch
in the sitting-room. It was used by various members of the family
on odd occasions when they spent a night in town. There were no
servants there, but occasionally a woman was requisitioned to clean
it up. It was in a dingy side-street, and the flat was always in a
muddle. Hence its title.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a nice scandal," continued Martin. "I suppose
he'll always be popping in there now when he's up at the
Slade."</p>

<p>"Emma Troon is wonderful," said Peter, solemnly. "She has sleepy
eyes with corybantic depths. There's some old ghost in her
ancestry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hell!" cried Martin. "Let's murder him. Corybantic
grandmothers! I'll teach him!" And Martin jerked Peter over
backwards upon Rodney's bed, and proceeded to smother him with a
pillow.</p>

<p>Any reference to the erotic passion was always treated by these
brothers with the lightest of raillery. There was a point beyond
which one could not go. It jarred the family fastidiousness. Love
was inherently the most wonderful thing in life. In the Querril
atmosphere there was no place for the counterfeit presentment.
Innumerable young men made love to Magda, and they found the
experience maddening. The Querrils were so blindly happy in their
unity that it never seemed to occur to them that two young people
might like to be left alone. They even went out for walks in
droves. And in the house and garden there was never any
opportunity. Magda was as inaccessible as a queen bee surrounded by
the hive. Martin had had various moon-calf experiences of a
transient nature. Rodney dreamed of love as of some enveloping
solution of all mysteries, to which he would consecrate his life.
And Peter? No one knew yet quite about Peter. He was barely twenty,
and was known as the philosopher of the family. No doubt in God's
good time the thing would come to him.</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The Querrils always had a cold supper on Sunday evenings and
waited on themselves. It was an understood thing among their
friends that the family kept open house on that occasion. Any one
was welcome, provided they were prepared to be riotous, and to help
themselves to cold chicken or beef from the sideboard.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lemaire appeared with a nephew, a young naval lieutenant, a
good-looking boy who was entirely successful in adding to the
general din. There was also a girl friend of Evelyn's named Alma
Meteyard, with a schoolboy brother. The only unsympathetic note was
the presence of Mr. Stride. The mere fact that they called him
"Mister" showed that he was not one of the inner circle. He was a
sallow, mournful individual, who had lived for years in East Africa
and there had contracted some incurable disease. Mr. Querril
invited him out of pity. His life appeared to be one eternal
protest. He talked lugubriously all through the supper to Mr.
Querril about the ways that rural committees abused their rights,
about the ignorance and want of patriotism of the lower classes,
about the folly and futility of the way everything was conducted in
the country, the ineptitude of the government, the apathy of the
church, the viciousness of society. He appeared quite undisturbed
by the general hubbub, but occasionally his eye would wander to the
other&mdash;the noisy&mdash;end of the table, and he would
mumble:</p>

<p>"M'&mdash;m'&mdash;yes. I like to see youth on the wing."</p>

<p>No one quite knew what he meant by that, but he stated it as
though he were tabulating one of the minor deficiencies of his own
mentality.</p>

<p>His jaws had an unfortunate habit of clicking when he masticated
his food, and in a pause Evelyn asked quite innocently what that
clicking noise was. The laughter which greeted some trivial jest of
Peter's immediately after must have appeared extravagant, both as
regards volume and period of duration. But Mr. Stride seemed quite
oblivious.</p>

<p>After supper they adjourned to the drawing-room, and played a
ridiculous card game called "Watch Billy," which occasioned more
noise and laughter. Mr. Querril took Mr. Stride into the library
and endured a further dose of ominous forebodings of the future of
South Africa. Then, after a time, he took his departure, and the
rest went up to Peter's studio, and Peter, Magda, and Annette
played a Brahms trio.</p>

<p>Mr. Querril sat back in his easy-chair and listened. He was not
very musical, but he loved to hear the children play. His mind
worked in pleasant grooves under the spell of musical progressions.
Little images danced before his mind, and vanished.</p>

<p>The room was in that alluring half-light, with the orange
lamp-shade standing out boldly against the topaz of the evening
sky; and the intent faces of the players, and the listeners grouped
haphazard along the wall, appeared romantic. It was a painter's
effect. Broad masses of simple tone and vivid notes of color.
Moving and mysterious, like the music of Brahms himself. Melody,
and behind it all life moving towards certain tremendous ends...He
observed Magda swaying very gently on the piano-stool, her whole
body and face expressing the rhythm.</p>

<p>"A shade faster, darling," she whispered to Peter once, for
Peter was always inclined to drag. And he frowned above his bow,
and drew forth deep and mysterious passages.</p>

<p>"He's a good-looking boy," thought Mr. Querril, and something
stirred within him, a kind of religious impulse, as though he
desired to give praise to that Power that had given him a son like
that, a being with an indestructible soul, possessing powers and
qualities beyond the comprehension of a father.</p>

<p>The Sanctuary!...It was all very beautiful. The troubles of the
preceding day were quite forgotten, the shadow of that existence
where there was suffering, dishonesty, malice, disappeared in this
gentle light. The mystery of music was absorbing. One observed the
compass of a scale, and then the thing got beyond one. Man was
finite, but linked indissolubly to infinite potentialities. The
keyboard expanded, revealed undreamt-of harmonies, only one became
conscious that they had been there all the time, dormant. Man was
like that, a keyboard on the outside, a god within...</p>

<p>The usual discussion followed. Magda, her face flushed and
excited, a strand of her beautiful hair breaking free upon her
cheek, exclaiming: "Annette darling, don't you think you played
this part a bit too straight? Peter dear, why will you always come
in half a bar late here? Let's play this bit again, from the top of
the page."</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>It was just before bedtime that Peter slipped out into the
garden alone. He strolled through the pergola and came out on to
the grass slope beyond the flower garden. The moon looked enormous
above the sleeping heath. He sighed.</p>

<p>"How perfectly ridiculous it is!" he thought, after a while.</p>

<p>He threw away the end of a cigarette and leaned over the back of
a wooden seat. Peter was barely twenty, an age when the emotions
are straining at the leash. A cricket beneath the hedge had heaps
to tell him. The heath looked lyrical in the silver light, like a
Corot.</p>

<p>"But the moon is too big," he thought inconsequently. "Corot
would never have painted such a big moon as that."</p>

<p>Then he laughed, and a phrase from the slow movement of the
Brahms trio ran through his mind. At twenty one is avid to ring the
changes of these newly found senses. It is all so surprising.
Things are always darting into one and out of one, long before one
has time to think about them. And when they have gone they leave
some nerve quivering with a strain of sweetness or bitterness, as
the case may be, but always the sense that they have never occurred
to any one else in quite the same way.</p>

<p>And Peter, of course, was a philosopher. He was the wise man of
the family. He was pre-eminently a Querril, but he lived more
inside himself. He felt first and thought afterwards, and then
turned his reflections over in his wise old head and examined them
at leisure. He sat in judgment on them, and rendered them into
epigrams, or masses of paint, or phrases on the 'cello. A
fellow-philosopher had once said to him:</p>

<p>"I can only paint landscape that is haunted by the ghosts of
dead lovers."</p>

<p>This had seemed to him ridiculous at first, but mature
reflection told him it was right. It was another way of saying that
a painting must be subjective, the happy hunting-ground of one's
own emotions, a lyrical presentment of a place where people, who
could love as he loved, had passed.</p>

<p>And it recurred to him to-night with singular force. He kept
blinking at the heath and repeating:</p>

<p>"It 'b too perfectly ridiculous!"</p>

<p>The images of love were always with Peter. He had been brought
up on a diet of little else. He had been enveloped, circumscribed,
almost smothered, with love from his cradle. He had proposed to
Annette when he was ten, and had been solemnly accepted. Annette
was the embodiment of all that was beautiful and adorable in the
Querril circle, the nearest thing to his mother or Magda.
Beautiful, companionable, accessible, she appeared the solution of
all desires and heartaches. They bird-nested together, read the
same books, quarreled and kissed. The stars could not have
predestined a more desirable communion.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, this other thing?...</p>

<p>Swift, volcanic, coming from outside, a whirlwind of disturbing
movements, fevered dreams, questionings, and something bitter-sweet
and dangerous and entrancingly&mdash;inevitable. An impetus that
seemed to accelerate his vitality, to make him a bigger and more
commanding personality...As though nothing else really mattered at
all.</p>

<p>Two bats swung in circles above his head.</p>

<p>"If the boys had only known when they were ragging me!" he
thought.</p>

<hr>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>He could see her now as he first saw her one day, two months
ago, at the Settlement. She had come in to fetch some medicine for
her mother. It was just the poise of her body which attracted him
first, the swing of her strong hips, a certain languorousness of
movement which seemed to indicate a suppressed vitality. One felt
that those limbs concealed the powers of greater activity. Like a
panther in a cage. He noticed the shabby frock, and then the round,
plump cheeks, and the masses of black hair tucked away beneath a
small hat; and then, to his confusion&mdash;"the sleepy eyes with
corybantic depths."</p>

<p>His first feeling was one of anger. That such a beautiful
creature should be a slum-child! And then, when he spoke to her, he
could not properly control his voice. And she never took her eyes
from his, as she answered briefly, in low tones that had a Southern
tang, making the cockneyisms attractive.</p>

<p>He had seen her only twice since then till the day when she came
to the Pig-sty. It was Rodney's idea that they should engage her to
keep the Pig-sty clean, and Peter used it more than any of the
others. He went to the Slade School three days a week, and he kept
most of his painting materials at the Pig-sty, and occasionally had
a meal there.</p>

<p>Peter looked up at the moon, a puzzled expression puckering his
philosopher's face. But the moon gave him no help, except dimly to
reflect a vision of Emma Troon's face. He looked at the clump of
fruit-trees in the Lemaires' garden across the hedge, and among
their dim branches the eyes of Emma Troon watched him appealingly.
The night appeared charged with an immensity of hidden powers. And
in some peculiar way he felt proud of being in touch with all these
important forces. The large moon seemed to be setting the scale in
some fantastic theater of activities, and his heart, beating
rapidly, gave thanks that in all the endless dramas being enacted
upon its many stages the motif was not always&mdash;philosophy!</p>

<p>He tried once more his dogged reiteration, "It's perfectly
ridiculous!" but his mind was again busy with the memory of her
visit to the Pig-sty.</p>

<p>He remembered that, as she was reaching up to a peg to hang up
her hat and cloak, he had noticed her small and battered boots, and
he had thought:</p>

<p>"How disgusting! I must get her some decent boots."</p>

<p>Her presence produced in him an emotional eddy, to cope with
which he was utterly uninstructed. It was something quite outside
the Querril curriculum. And through it all was a streak of the
intensest pity. His chivalry was quickened. He felt that somehow
Fate had sidetracked this beautiful creature. There had been some
horrible muddle and misunderstanding. It couldn't be right. When he
saw her later in the morning, kneeling down and scrubbing a floor
in the hall, he nearly cried out. When he left, he said:</p>

<p>"I shouldn't bother to scrub the floors, Emma. We&mdash;get a
woman in to do that sometimes."</p>

<p>It sounded lame. He wanted to say so much more. He could see her
now, looking up at him with her strained eyes, her breasts panting
with exertion. She had answered:</p>

<p>"All right, sir."</p>

<p>He had hovered by the door, and added:</p>

<p>"Don't bother to call me 'sir,' Emma." She had not answered, and
he felt that he had behaved dismally.</p>

<p>On the following day he saw her again. To his surprise she had
on a new blouse and apron and&mdash;<i>mirabile
dictu!</i>&mdash;new boots. She looked brighter and more cheerful.
If not more communicative, she seemed in any case more responsive
and watchfully alert to his presence, as though in this little
pocket-drama she did not mean to play merely an objective part.
Once she brought him the patent carpet-sweeper, and asked him if he
would explain how to empty it. Peter had not the faintest idea, but
he fumbled with the thing till he found out. And then he became
alarmingly conscious of her presence. Her head almost touched his,
and once a strand of her hair flicked his cheek as they leaned
together over the sweeper. Also he became aware of some faint scent
about her. It was not the kind of scent that Magda and Evelyn
occasionally used, but a distinctive, lingering perfume like the
warmth of this summer evening among the white flowers and the
mysterious fruit-trees. Just like this night.</p>

<p>Some one was moving on the terrace by the house. His father was
coughing, and knocking out his pipe against the wall. He could hear
his low voice talking to one of the boys, and then a light frock
appeared, and his mother's voice rang out:</p>

<p>"Peter darling, are you there?...COCOA!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter 4&mdash;The Interferer</h2>

<hr>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Emma Troon walked slowly along the Queen's Road at Hammersmith,
carrying a string bag containing bread, matches, onions, blacking,
and potatoes. The roadway was congested with pedestrians sauntering
at the same pace as herself. Barrows and stalls crowded upon each
other, whereat one might purchase cat's-meat, vegetables, fried
fish, old iron, secondhand skirts and stockings, or brightly
colored sweets. The shops, frowning across the intruding barrows,
vied with each other in their miscellaneous assortments of goods
and garbage and noise. At intervals, gaudily assertive public
houses glittered uninvitingly. A maternal Government had forbidden
the taking of babies and young children into them, so their
accommodating owners had built little tiled and covered-in
passages, where the children might be left to play in the dirt and
the draft. They were, on this morning, crowded with perambulators
and anemic, undersized fragments of humanity stridently querulous.
At the corner of one street a fat man with a goiter on his neck was
trying to sell a puzzle, and a man with no legs was strapped into a
wheeled chair and playing a concertina. The street was littered
with cabbage leaves and old newspapers. There was that eery smell
peculiar to certain slums of London, which seems a concentrated
odor of fish, beer, dirt, and perspiration.</p>

<p>None of these things impressed Emma very greatly. It was the
atmosphere in which she had spent her life. She observed it
languorously, as though conscious that, though she was in it, she
was not of it. Perhaps, as Peter had said, there was some "old
ghost in her ancestry." It was a boy at the Battenburg buildings
(where she lived with her father and stepmother) who had first
called her "The Watcher." It probably originated from her trick of
standing on one of the open stone landings and looking across the
iron railings at the river. She would stand there for hours at a
time, like a person wrecked on an island and watching for a sail.
Her large dark eyes were always watching. She searched the faces of
every one she met, as though within her was some brooding problem
of which they might possess the master-key. She appeared very
young, but overdeveloped, in the Latin way. Her movements were
unconsciously picturesque, and she had a genius for keeping herself
clean without encouragement, for making the most of her poor
clothes, and for placing some little knickknack of color in the
right place.</p>

<p>She watched the faces of every one, and most particularly did
she watch the faces of her stepmother and of her father, and in
this case she had good cause to be watchful.</p>

<p>She watched her stepmother with a kind of wondering contempt
that so poor and spiritless a thing should be. And she watched her
father with awe and terror, because she knew she had to study his
moods, and that in certain moods he struck her, and then she had to
be very watchful indeed. When he came home from the wharf in the
evening, she never knew whether he would be sullen, hilarious, or
maudlin. But she knew that in whatever mood he came, he would bring
with him the reeking atmosphere of the taproom. His brain was
sodden with drink. It seemed almost incredible that they should
still keep him on at the wharf. It was probably because he was so
strong, and liked to demonstrate it. Jim Troon could lift weights
that no other man between Mortlake and Putney could touch. She had
seen him lift great blocks of stone without staggering. She admired
him at such moments. She had a tremendous admiration for strength.
She had been to cinemas occasionally. The hero was always strong.
He rode wild horses, leaped from trains, killed people who thwarted
him...Strength was dimly associated with the elves of romance which
danced at the back of her life. Emma had no intention of continuing
this life forever.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>But the evening was close, and she felt depressed and weary. She
walked across the asphalt court of Battenburg buildings, and up the
stone staircase. At the third landing she stopped and looked out
across the river.'she could hear the shrill cries of quarreling
children in the courts below. The river looked dull and menacing,
with the great factory chimneys frowning ahead. A somewhat bloated
sparrow, with its feathers coming out, settled on the iron railing
and then fluttered away. Emma went up another flight and entered a
door numbered 664. The stepmother, in a canvas apron and a cloth
cap, snatched the string bag from her hand and cried:</p>

<p>"Come on, for Gawd's sake! Where yer been? 'E'll be in in 'arf
an hour."</p>

<p>She got a knife, and helped Mrs. Troon to peel the onions, an
operation which always made her eyes water. Mrs. Troon continued
upbraiding her in little jerky sentences, and she did not deign to
reply. One remark only impressed itself on her mind:</p>

<p>"It's quite time you was out earnin' yer livin'."</p>

<p>It had often struck Emma as remarkable that her father had never
insisted on this. On the contrary, he seemed to hold some violent
antipathy to it. Living as they did, from hand to mouth, and
frequently with nothing at all to convey from the hand to the
mouth, it would surely have been better for every one. She herself
might be happier. She would in any case meet other people, enjoy
new experiences. But when she suggested it, he flew into a violent
rage and would give no reason. Indeed, he was never normal. He had
many unaccountable traits, and like others of his moral fiber (or
lack of moral fiber) he showed extraordinary cunning on occasions.
He displayed a genius for finding out what his women-folk were
doing all day, and he knew to a penny on what they spent the meager
housekeeping allowance. The question of earning her own living had
occupied the mind of Emma very considerably of late. She was
becoming restless. Anything would be better than this bullying,
nagging misery, the eternal hunger, and fear of physical pain, and
always at the back of it the terror...the terror of something
nameless and more horrible still.</p>

<p>There were times when she doubted whether her father was
sane.</p>

<p>She learned from a girl in the buildings that she could get
employment at a bottling factory. The hours were long and the wages
twelve to fifteen shillings a week. Could a girl live on twelve or
fifteen shillings a week? Some did, and some lived with parents, or
clubbed together in twos and threes. Her friend also told her with
a wink that some of them "picked up a bit in their spare time."
Emma was sufficiently sophisticated to give a shrewd guess as to
what this implied, and it did not horrify her. The only thing she
feared was her father, and his physical violence. One day he might
go too far. And she had within her some fierce instinct of
self-preservation. She meant to fight for her life. She was
adolescent, full-blooded, with an infinite capacity for enjoyment.
And these qualities were being suppressed and threatened. Life was
not all like this. She had seen things...heard what the girls said.
Her dreams were colored with romantic tissues, in which people
moved softly in modulated lights, and music never ceased. Vague
schemes were forming in her imagination already.</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The potatoes and onions were cooking. She sat on a high box and
commenced to draw together the widening gaps in a pair of
stockings. Mrs. Troon grumbled over the fireplace, and wiped three
plates with a dirty rag.</p>

<p>Their tenement apartments consisted of three rooms and a
diminutive scullery. One room was Mr. and Mrs. Troon's bedroom, the
smallest room was Emma's bedroom, and the third room was a
combination of living-room and kitchen. It opened on the
staircase.</p>

<p>She had not sat there many minutes before Mr. Troon came in. She
glanced at him. He was in his sullen mood, which was the least
objectionable and least dangerous one. In that mood he would merely
sit there without speaking, and content himself with growls and
curses. The mood she most dreaded was his hilarious mood. He would
come in singing and laughing, and be clumsily playful. And then,
suddenly, some little thing would upset him, and his small eyes
would blaze with anger. It was on one such occasion that he had
kicked Emma on the thigh, and struck Mrs. Troon with a plate and
cut her temple. Consequently, it was almost with a sigh of relief
that Emma observed him bang the door and throw his cap upon the
table, and then sit heavily down in the chair by the fireplace.
They never exchanged greetings, this family; and Mr. Troon produced
a copy of the "Evening News" and filled his pipe with shag, and
began to read. He read for ten minutes, and then he said:</p>

<p>"When's the' blasted supper going to be ready?"</p>

<p>And then the trouble was that although the potatoes were
virtually cooked, the onions would be at least another fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Troon began a whining complaint:</p>

<p>"I towld 'er to 'urry up. Once she gets down Queen's Road she
goes gaping abaht, takin' 'alf the afternoon to get a few pennorth
o' onions. Quite time she was out earnin' 'er own livin', I say. A
great gal like that, idlin' abaht all day."</p>

<p>Mr. Troon listened to the harangue for some time, then he said
suddenly:</p>

<p>"O Christ!"</p>

<p>And he picked up his cap and went out.</p>

<p>When he had gone Mrs. Troon sniffed, and continued:</p>

<p>"I towld yer 'ow it would be. And now there 'e is, 'e's gone off
to The Cuttle-Fish,' and 'e'll come back Gawd knows what time, with
a skin full."</p>

<p>"I can't help it," said Emma sullenly. "You never know what time
he'll come in, or what he'll do, or what he'll be like. I don't
care a damn what he does."</p>

<p>But she knew that Mrs. Troon's pessimistic prophecy was doomed
to be correct. She sat there darning till the room got too dark to
see to work. The onions and potatoes were cooked and dished up, and
put in a pan on the hob. They lighted the gas, and busied
themselves with little odds and ends. A barrel-organ was playing on
the Embankment below. Children were still squalling down in the
court and on the staircases. The room seemed to become suddenly
like a prison. The cheap carriage clock on the mantel-shelf ticked
out the truncated seconds. Time lost all proportion. The impatient
hours jostled each other impetuously. There suddenly came to her a
feeling of despair, a wild desire to escape from a nameless fate.
She was consumed with a presentiment that something awful that she
had dreaded was going to happen to-night, some climax to her
unfortunate existence. She became terribly frightened.</p>

<p>Suddenly the thought came to her: "I will run away...now,
forever...somewhere...anywhere. Anything will be better than
this."</p>

<p>What was it the organ was playing? Some tune telling of gay
lands and places where people laughed, and sang, and "walked
softly."</p>

<p>"They pick up a bit in their spare time."</p>

<p>She smiled bitterly, and a sullen reflection occurred to
her:</p>

<p>"After all, why bother to work from six to six-thirty if money
can be made as easily as that?"</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>In the hard school of her experience, every one got the
uttermost for as little as possible. No quarter was given or
expected. No one argued, philosophized, interfered or&mdash;looked
back. If one succeeded, well, good luck to you! No questions were
asked. If one failed&mdash;one went under, with a shrug of the
shoulders. Who cared? Who cared? Who cares? My God! who cares?</p>

<p>She snatched her hat and jammed it on her head. She took her
purse, and became aware that it contained one penny and five
half-pennies. She swung across the room, mumbling to her
stepmother:</p>

<p>"I think I'll just walk to the corner."</p>

<p>What did it all matter? Her hand was stretched toward the handle
when she heard coming up the staircase the ominous sound
of&mdash;her father's voice in song. He was in that most dangerous
of moods&mdash;hilarity! She heard his footsteps stumbling and
kicking the steps and walls. It was too late! She heard his key
fumbling for the lock, the snap of the door, and the thick tones of
his voice:</p>

<p>"Hullo, my dear, where yorfto?"</p>

<p>He didn't wait for an answer. He stumbled in and banged the
door. Then in a sudden discordant voice he sang:</p>

<p class="poem">"They laid 'er in the cowld, cowld grahnd,<br>
Thet's where they laid 'er&mdash;upside dahn."</p>

<p>He held on to the door for support and repeated this lugubrious
refrain a dozen times without variation. Then, suddenly releasing
himself, he screamed at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>"MAR-I-A!" and added incoherently: "Come now, let's 'ave
some&mdash;grub!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Troon began fuming and fussing in the background,
clattering with the saucepans, and Emma, her breath coming quickly,
tried to slip by him at the door. But he was suddenly very alert,
very suspicious:</p>

<p>"'Ullo, my ducky," he said, "where are you goin'? Where's my
pretty bird goin', eh?"</p>

<p>She tried to reply nonchalantly: "Oh! I'm just going to the
corner."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you ain't, my pretty. You come and sit down next to yer
dear old father. When a gen'l'man comes 'ome in the evening 'e
wants to 'ave all 'is lovin' family round 'im."</p>

<p>She stood there, looking furtively at the lock. And then
suddenly his arms, like bands of steel, gripped her shoulders, and
his drunken voice whispered:</p>

<p>"You'll stay at 'ome with yer dear old puppa, my darling."</p>

<p>She struggled abortively with a potent blast of gin, beer, and
tobacco, and then found herself 'being flung limply across the
room, as the song broke out again:</p>

<p class="poem">"They laid 'er in the cowld, cowld grahnd."</p>

<p>She stood by the fireplace, quivering and feeling faint. There
was a moment's respite. Mr. Troon was suddenly occupied with the
scent of food. He fell into a seat and ate greedily the food set
before him. For some minutes he ignored the others. He ate noisily,
occasionally breaking into snatches of song, and shouting out at
random blasphemies and incomprehensible remarks. After a time his
hunger was sated, and he became aggrieved that the others were not
doing justice to the good food that he had paid for. He became
unreasonably angry with Emma that she did not return his paternal
endearments. He said to Emma:</p>

<p>"'Ma, 'ave 'nother onion!"</p>

<p>Emma shook her head.</p>

<p>"'Ave 'nother onion," he insisted.</p>

<p>She still shook her head, and murmured, "I don't want it."</p>

<p>And then the small eyes blazed with fury.</p>

<p>"By Christ! you <i>shall</i> have 'nother onion."</p>

<p>He picked up an onion in his fingers, all hot from the dish, and
clapped it on her mouth. And Emma screamed, and Mrs. Troon, waving
her long arms, cried out:</p>

<p>"Don't be a fule, Jim. For Gawd'a sake, leave the girl be!"</p>

<p>But the reaction had come. Jim was all out of hand. The spirit
of Flaming Vengeance was abroad. His wife and daughter were two
dirty, sanguinary trolls. They spent their dirty existences trying
to thwart him in every way. They conspired together against him.
His God, He'd see that they didn't come it over him. Old Castro had
always warned him. What old Castro didn't know about women wasn't
worth knowing.</p>

<p>(When Jim Troon was particularly rampageous he always talked
about and quoted "old Castro," a person of whom Emma was entirely
ignorant.)</p>

<p>It is possible that on this occasion this violent mood might
have worked itself to some innocuous climax but for an unfortunate
accident. In an hysterical moment, not conscious of what he was
doing, Mr. Troon knocked out the contents of his pipe into a jug of
milk destined for the morning's breakfast, and Mrs. Troon
completely lost her temper. She screamed at her husband:</p>

<p>"Mind what yer doin', yer dirty, filthy old&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then Mr. Troon began to see red. He seized the jug and flung
it at Mrs. Troon's face. That lady screamed and seized the
frying-pan, as though she were going to assault him with it, and
her husband gripped her arm and flung her across the room. He
growled like a wild beast, and held the frying-pan himself and
advanced upon her. And Emma, in a state of frenzy, groped her way
between them. The terror she had been dreading was on her. She
gasped:</p>

<p>"No, no...don't...don't!"</p>

<p>He steadied himself as though for some abnormal onslaught,
baring his forearm. And then suddenly there came a gentle but firm
tap on the door.</p>

<p>The three of them stopped, and looked round amazed, like animals
disturbed in a game. Neither of them spoke, and the knock was
repeated. And still they stood there. And then the door opened
slowly. Emma, recovering herself first, pushed back her hair and
walked toward it. In the doorway stood a young man.</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>He was tall, calm, and well dressed. He held his hat in his
hand, and said in a quiet voice:</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Troon live here?"</p>

<p>Emma replied, "Yes," very faintly, and he stepped into the
room.</p>

<p>"May I come in and have a word with you, Mr. Troon?"</p>

<p>He shut the door quietly, and stepped by her with an air of calm
assurance, and bowed politely to the three of them.</p>

<p>Jim Troon, his eyes blazing, like an animal that has been robbed
of its prey, bore down upon him.</p>

<p>"Well, who are you? and what the hell do you want?" was his
greeting.</p>

<p>The young man, who seemed slightly taken back by this onslaught,
pulled himself together, and smiled in a friendly way.</p>

<p>"I have called from the Treves Settlement&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Then you can damn well go back to the Treves Settlement,"
roared his host.</p>

<p>The young man made no attempt to move, but shrugged his
shoulders questioningly. And Troon went up and swung his arms
threateningly.</p>

<p>"D'year what I say?" he screamed. "Get back to
yer&mdash;&mdash;Settlement. I know all about the Settlement! A
crowd of dirty limejuice spies. D'year what I say? Get out, or I'll
smash yer dirty, ugly, face in."</p>

<p>The young man surveyed him steadily, and the thought flashed
through his mind: "He's a moral degenerate, almost mentally
deficient. Now how on earth do we stand with the law over a case
like this?"</p>

<p>Out loud he said:</p>

<p>"I've come here entirely in your interest, Mr. Troon. We have no
ideas other than to be of use. Of course if you wish me to
go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell you I wish you to go. Get out of my sight! You're
thieves and spies."</p>

<p>The young man flushed, but he was keeping himself in hand. He
changed his tone.</p>

<p>"You have no right to say that, Mr. Troon. It could hardly be
correct in any case, or the police would not give us that measure
of help and&mdash;protection which they do."</p>

<p>He laid a slight emphasis on the word "police," and Emma noticed
her father's eyes contract in the way they did when one of his
cunning moods possessed him.</p>

<p>The young man continued, still firmly:</p>

<p>"Our motives are entirely charitable. We even have the right to
insist on being charitable, to interfere...when convinced of the
necessity."</p>

<p>Then, as though the matter were settled once and for all, he
added more genially:</p>

<p>"Come, come, Mr. Troon. You must be reasonable. It is true we
know something about you, but we have no desire to spy. Surely we
can make things a little more comfortable for you, and for...your
family?"</p>

<p>"Me and my family are quite 'appy and comfortable, thank yer,"
answered Jim, surlily.</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to hear it," replied the visitor briskly. Then he
glanced round the room and remarked:</p>

<p>"All we were thinking of was this. Next winter will be a hard
one, and we are preparing for it. We are enquiring into special
cases. Mrs. Daubeney, who lives at 451, is bedridden, and her son
earns only seventeen shillings a week. We have arranged to allow
her a hundredweight of coal a month. And we have a certain number
of blankets&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We don't want none of yer damn charity," cut in Jim stonily;
but the whining voice of Mrs. Troon drowned his:</p>

<p>"Gawd save us, sir. Don't you take no notice of 'im. Lord! we
could do with a bit. What with Jim always bein' on the booze, and
that great 'ulk of a gal doin' nothin'. So 'elp me Gawd, it's a
'ard life, sir."</p>

<p>While this little scrap of dialogue ensued, the young man
glanced at Emma, and their eyes met. She became aware at that
instant of some strange inner disturbance, something that seemed
connected with her pulse, her heart, her brain. She was
extravagantly conscious of having her hat on and knowing that she
had put it on in order to go out and meet that destiny of which she
had a prevision. She dreaded that this good-looking young man would
ask, "Where were you going when I came in?" He seemed to know
everything. It was as though, in some mysterious manner, the winds
of her destiny had suddenly shifted her course.</p>

<p>The climax seemed right here amidst these disheveled plates and
cups in the cold light of the incandescent gas. It was as though a
messenger had come from another existence to fetch her away. She
was faint from want of food. Her instincts, unschooled to any
social understanding, cabined and directed by the eternal struggle
for food and petty comforts, governed her mentality and way of
life. And beneath their primitive expression there stirred at that
moment, perhaps for the first time in her life, a feeling of shame.
She was intensely conscious of herself in that squalid room, the
table littered with newspapers and broken food, the cloth stained
with beer and gravy, the broken chair, her own disreputable
stockings lying on the box, and, perhaps more insistent than
anything, that smashed onion which her father had clapped over her
mouth, lying disgustingly scattered on the floor. She moved towards
it with some vague instinct of concealment. She was shivering with
the nervous strain of her tragic experience, when suddenly the
onion seemed to be obscured by great blotches which raced each
other in front of it.</p>

<p>She felt herself falling, and some one caught her...</p>

<p>When she came to, she was lying on the bed in her own room, and
the young man was bending over her and rubbing her hands. Mrs.
Troon was hovering by the door, and her father was not to be seen.
She felt very lazy and indifferent. She could hear the nasal whine
of Mrs. Troon's voice, and then the young man saying:</p>

<p>"She'll be all right now. I'll send round some beef-tea and some
other stuff."</p>

<p>He held her hand firmly and said:</p>

<p>"Well, little girl, how do you feel? Better?"</p>

<p>She tried to smile, and answered faintly:</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you."</p>

<p>He patted her hand and nodded. Then he turned again to Mrs.
Troon and spoke:</p>

<p>"Well, if she isn't quite all right, soon, or if there's
anything you want, send round to the Treves Settlement, Mrs.
Troon."</p>

<p>Mrs. Troon appeared to be in her most amiable mood. She
answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I will, sir, and thank you very much, sir. And for
Gawd's sake don't you take no notice of 'im, sir."</p>

<p>As he was going, she added:</p>

<p>"If I <i>do</i> 'ave to call, sir, who will I ask for, sir?"</p>

<p>And the young man replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, any one will attend to you, but if you want to see me, ask
for Mr. Querril. Mr. Rodney Querril."</p>

Pig-Sty</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The mind of Jim Troon acted in cycles. At least, that was Emma's
experience. She got to know by his behavior what was coming, and
how long it would be before he got back to the point from which he
started. She had foreseen that after the young man's departure and
her own breakdown, that her father was arriving on the threshold of
a period of cunning and intrigue. His behavior at the time was the
tail-end of a storm, and the visit would give him food for
reflection. He would never whine for charity as his wife had done.
It wasn't his way. But he would undoubtedly scheme to derive from
the visit some benefit to himself. He enjoyed scheming and plotting
to attain his ends, and if in the process he could manage to wound
and hurt people, so much the better.</p>

<p>On the day following, he seemed much quieter and more amenable,
and one little incident impressed her. The young man had taken out
a half-sheet of notepaper, and on it he had scribbled the name of a
bottle of tonic. He had given it to Mrs. Troon and told her to take
it to a certain chemist, who would supply it free. It was for Emma.
The medicine had been duly obtained, and both Mrs. Troon and Emma
benefited by it. On the back of the sheet of notepaper was stamped:
"Ballinger Court&mdash;Chessilton Heath&mdash;Surrey?" In the
evening she noticed her father pick up the half-sheet of notepaper,
turn it over, and examine it carefully, and then he put it in his
pocket.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>A few days later Mrs. Troon developed bronchitis. Emma did not
know that it was bronchitis, but she knew that her stepmother was
very ill, and certainly not fit to walk to the hospital.
Immediately she thought of the young man with the kind eyes.
Indeed, she had thought of very little but the young man with the
kind eyes since his visit, but this was the first excuse she had
had of calling. She spent two hours on her scanty toilet, and
sallied forth.</p>

<p>The Treves Settlement was a tall, gaunt house in a poor street.
We have said that Rodney was its ruling spirit, but this was not in
effect quite true; lie was only the ruling spirit among the
Querrils. It was really run by a small committee of whom Rodney was
one. Its principal support was a Mrs. Basingstoke, the widow of a
wealthy ship-broker from Yorkshire. Mrs. Basingstoke gave up the
whole of her time, and nearly the whole of her wealth, to the
Settlement. She was a plain little woman, who worked hard, said
very little, and dressed shabbily. Several other people, like the
Querril boys, gave up what time and money they could spare. The
ideas of the Settlement were simple and unpretentious. They were,
as Rodney once explained: "To make the best of a forlorn situation.
To do in a small way what the Government ought to have done in a
big way years ago. Such a place as ours ought not to exist; there
ought not to be any need for it, but what are you to do?"</p>

<p>The Treves people were only doing what hundreds of others were
doing&mdash;trying to blot up the puddles with blotting-paper. They
sought out individual cases of distress and did what they could.
They kept a record of comings and goings, proffered advice and
received abuse. They received no recognition, and&mdash;in spite of
what Rodney had told Mr. Troon&mdash;were looked on with suspicion
by the police.</p>

<p>The only point of policy over which Mrs. Basingstoke and Rodney
differed, quite amicably, was that of the question of interference.
Mrs. Basingstoke had said laconically: "Never interfere, Mr.
Querril. Do what you can, but don't interfere. I have been at this
work for thirty-five years."</p>

<p>But Rodney had been at it for six months, and he was young and
impatient.</p>

<p>"You can do so much more if you interfere," he said.</p>

<p>And he had talked it over with Martin and Peter, and his
conclusions were:</p>

<p>"You <i>must</i> interfere. All progress is a question of
interference. If I know a thing is right, I must assert it, and
stick to it, and, if necessary, fight for it. If I see a man
ill-treating his wife, am I to walk by on the other side? It's all
nonsense, all this talk about leaving people alone. Jesus Christ,
Martin Luther, Cromwell, Lincoln, Mahomet&mdash;all these people
interfered, or we shouldn't be where we are to-day. Democracy is
just beginning to scratch the surface, and democracy is going to
interfere with individual life much more than autocracy ever
did&mdash;much more than people think. Democracy is going to be a
good red-hot interferer. Some people have an idea that when we get
democratic ideals established there will be nothing to do but sit
down and enjoy the fruits of it, but, as a matter of fact, liberty
demands a more exacting discipline than tyranny. Fancy not being
allowed to sweat people, to exploit their brains, to amass colossal
fortunes, to treat women as inferiors&mdash;fancy, in effect, money
not being allowed to buy anything it wants!"</p>

<p>And so Rodney went about tilting at social and individual
windmills. The chase excited him. He was quite fearless. He assumed
powers that he had not got. He was quite unscrupulous in his mild
mission to "do what he could." And on occasions he was enormously
successful.</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Emma Troon was told by a lady in a little inquiry-office that
Mr. Querril was upstairs in a room at the end of the passage on the
second floor. Thither she went, and tapped on the door like a
flustered bird. A voice called out:</p>

<p>"Come in."</p>

<p>She opened the door and went in, and then die had a
disconcerting surprise. A young man looked up from a desk, and for
an instant she thought it was the young man who had paid the visit.
She advanced towards him and then suddenly realized that, although
the eyes were somewhat similar, it was not the same young man. She
stammered:</p>

<p>"Oh! I&mdash;er&mdash;I beg your pardon. It was Mr. Querril I
wanted."</p>

<p>The young man looked at her very hard as he replied, in a
gentle, purry voice:</p>

<p>"I expect it was my brother you met. He's not here to-day. Let
me see; what is your name? Can I help you in any way? Won't you sit
down?"</p>

<p>It was very strange. She could not keep her eyes from his. There
was something warm and comfortable about him. He was shorter than
his brother, but broader, and he looked stronger. She liked the
wisp of brown hair which curled boyishly across his temple to his
right eyebrow. He looked young, vigorous, with that flavor about
him of another world, where people "moved softly"&mdash;just like
they did in films. Her unerring instincts told her, moreover, that
she was affecting him in some peculiar way. He looked flustered, as
though inwardly cursing his shyness and awkwardness, when he
desired so keenly to don the gay plumage of the dominant male. She
sat down and said:</p>

<p>"My name is Emma Troon, and Stepmother's sick."</p>

<p>He answered something about it being "too bad," and then made
some tentative inquiries. But he wasn't thinking a bit about his
questions or her replies. He was looking at her hair, her eyes,
and, rather self-consciously, at her shabby boots. He seemed to be
thoroughly ashamed of himself that she should have boots like that.
He said, after a time, that the settlement doctor should go round
and see her aunt&mdash;no, her stepmother.</p>

<p>Yes, it was too bad, he said. There was a long pause after that,
during which they just sat there and glanced at each other
furtively. At length he said faintly:</p>

<p>"So there's nothing more, Miss Troon?"</p>

<p>"No, there's nothing more to-day, thanks," she replied. An
appalling reply! The sort of thing one says to the milkman.</p>

<p>He walked across to the door with her, and shook hands. His hand
was firm, and supple, and cool. She had never felt a hand like
that. He said:</p>

<p>"Good-by. If there's anything more, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>She tried to be calm, and like a woman of his world&mdash;the
world of films&mdash;but she only succeeded in saying:</p>

<p>"I see. Thanks. Good-by."</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>That evening Emma was very busy with her needle. She mended her
stockings and began to make up some old material into a blouse. She
cooked her father's supper and left it on the hob to keep warm. The
stepmother was sleeping noisily in the inner room. The doctor had
been, and sent some medicine and a stone hot water bottle, and with
it had arrived a mysterious basket of fruit. Emma liked fruit, but
her stepmother never touched it.</p>

<p>Her father came in later than usual. He seemed in a merry mood,
but not noisily hilarious. Something seemed to tickle him
exceedingly. Emma had never known him so good-tempered and
possible. He even rallied her about the blouse she was making, and
told her that Mr. Bennett at "The Cuttle-Fish" had inquired "'ow
'is pretty gal was." This seemed to amuse Jim Troon. He repeated it
several times and slapped his leg. After supper he sat smoking his
pipe and reading the newspaper. And then Emma became uncomfortably
aware that he was not really reading the newspaper. He was watching
her.</p>

<p>She continued sewing, and then moved about the flat, tidying
things up. She moved silently, like a large black cat. She came
into the lamplight, her pretty fingers busy with plates and knives,
then she moved away, a dim and sinuous silhouette. Once she hummed
a little tune, and her voice was full and mellow.</p>

<p>Jim Troon stared at the bowl of his pipe. Then he expectorated
into the fireplace, and went out.</p>

<p>"Curse it!" thought Emma. "I suppose he'll come back very late,
and smash the place up."</p>

<p>But she had no thought now of either going to the bottling
factory, or of vanishing behind the mists of that other uncertain
experience. She took up her blouse again and cogitated upon the
possibilities of being able to raise a few shillings to get a new
piece of material. The outlook was not promising.</p>

<p>Soon after tea her father returned again. To her surprise he was
not unduly hilarious. In fact, he seemed abnormally normal. He put
down his cap quite quietly, and once more sat down and read the
newspaper. He asked one or two questions about the doctor, and at
half-past ten he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I shall turn in now."</p>

<p>Then he came up close to Emma and looked at the blouse she was
making. He seemed restless and strangely self-conscious. Suddenly
he said:</p>

<p>"What's the good of makin' up that old stuff? 'Ere, go and get
yourself a noo one."</p>

<p>And he put down ten shillings on the table, and went to bed.</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>On her next visit to the Settlement, Emma saw Rodney, and her
visit was fraught with dramatic consequences. She did not like
Rodney in the way she did Peter, but he was easier to talk to.
There was no self-consciousness between them. Rodney treated her
like a child and called her "Emma." He was very fatherly and kind.
When she had reported about the condition of the stepmother, he
suddenly remarked: "And how is your father, Emma?" She looked up at
him quickly and replied: "Pretty middling, thank you, sir." Rodney
sat with his knuckles pressed together, examining her. At last he
said quietly:</p>

<p>"Now, tell me, Emma, quite between ourselves&mdash;does your
father...behave unkindly to you at times?"</p>

<p>Emma stared at him, and her bosom heaved. She felt uncertain how
to answer. Much as she feared and hated her father, there was an
animal instinct to fight for its kind. She resented being forced
into betraying him. She had the unedueated's fear of the power of
the educated. She did not know what powers these mysterious people
exercised, what rights they held, or how they meant to use them.
(This one had spoken intimately of "the police.") At the same time,
she did not believe that either of these brothers could do anything
unkind. There was something about the way they spoke that made one
want to choke. She looked on the ground, and answered in a husky
voice:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He nodded his head, and continued in a soothing voice:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. He drinks, doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Emma, does he actually strike you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And your stepmother?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then suddenly Emma broke down and
sobbed.</p>

<p>"O Christ!" she blurted out. "Sometimes he's like a wild
beast!"</p>

<p>The young man jumped up, and came over and patted her
shoulder.</p>

<p>"There, there," he said. "Don't cry, Emma; don't cry! We'll see
if we can't make things a little better. I'm so sorry. Now, you go
straight home, and don't worry about anything. They'll give you the
malted milk downstairs, and you take some yourself. It's going to
be all right, you see."</p>

<p>He pressed her hands, and took her downstairs himself, and one
of the ladies did her up a large, brown-paper parcel.</p>

<hr>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>At seven o'clock that evening Jim Troon rolled out of the
private bar of "The Cuttle-Fish." It was a fine evening, and two
half-quarterns of gin mixed with a quart of ale conspired to turn
his mind to thoughts of song. He stuck his hands in his pockets,
and chanted:</p>

<p class="poem">"They laid 'er in the cowld, cowld grahnd!"</p>

<p>He had not gone more than fifty yards when he met a young man,
who came straight up to him and said:</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Troon!"</p>

<p>Jim stared at him, and recognized him as the young man who had
called from the Settlement. He was in the mood to be uncommonly
friendly. He clapped the other on the back and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Hul-LO! my dear boy, how goes it?"</p>

<p>And then the young man behaved very unfriendly. He didn't take
the advance in the right spirit at all. He just stood there, and
delivered himself of this harangue:</p>

<p>"I've got to tell you something pretty straight, Mr. Troon, and
you must let it sink into your head. Listen to me. You're being
watched. We cannot help you if you insist on getting drunk. That's
your own affair. But if you ever again raise your hand against your
wife or daughter, there will be serious trouble."</p>

<p>The instinct of Jim was a simple and primitive one. He looked at
the slight pale face in front of him, and he thought:</p>

<p>"I'll feint with my right, and then bring my left
across&mdash;biff! swish! and knock his blasted face through the
middle of his neck!"</p>

<p>The conditions were ideal for such an operation, and his spirits
attuned to the virile purpose. The young man's head was silhouetted
against a mustard-colored wall, and the light was excellent. And
then he inconsistently looked past him, and his eye alighted on the
solid chunk of a sleepy policeman standing idly on the curb, not
twenty-five yards away. He hesitated and growled:</p>

<p>"Whatcher talkin' abaht?"</p>

<p>The young man's face was very earnest, and his manner very
emphatic:</p>

<p>"We do not want to interfere with you, but it 'a got to stop. Do
you understand? You can do what you like, but your women-folk have
got to be decently treated. There's to be no violence. Now, let
that soak in, Mr. Troon, and don't be a fool. Good evening."</p>

<p>He turned, and walked deliberately away, and left Jim fuming by
the mustard-colored wall. He emitted a string of unprintable oaths,
hesitated...and then returned to the bar of "The Cuttle-Fish."
Another half-quartern of gin would help to steady him, and perhaps
give him an inspiration. He was well known in "The Cuttle-Fish,"
where he never lacked genial society, but on this occasion he
replied gruffly to friendly greetings, and retired to the little
room at the back, with his glass of gin.</p>

<p>He was choked with rage. He could not think or collect himself.
He sat there smoking and sipping his drink. Stung by this outrage,
he had been robbed of his natural need of satisfying violence. If
he had been allowed at that moment to rend, smash or destroy
something, this story need never have been chronicled. But he had
been thwarted at a climacteric, and his mind instinctively groped
its way along its cycle of progressions in search of some weapon of
retaliation. What particularly angered him was that during the last
few days his brain-cells had been cerebrating toward some vague
effort at reform. Not necessarily moral reform, but reform as
regarded his own external behavior. He never intended to destroy
these young men. He was going to use them, certainly, but a
pleasant, harmless little game...And now! a torrent of wrath rushed
through his veins when he recollected how he had demeaned himself
by being pleasant to this white-faced swine! His "women-folk"! By
God!...He could hardly get his breath. Interfering lime-juice
snarks butting into his affairs! The face of Jim must have looked
horrible at that moment. In such matters, the old proverb of "an
eye for an eye," etc., was not sufficient. He would have a hundred
eyes for one eye, and a hundred teeth for one tooth. His hand
trembled as he put down his glass, and from his jacket pocket drew
out a half-sheet of notepaper.</p>

<hr>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Two mornings later, Emma once more appeared at the Treves
Settlement, and again saw Rodney. He smiled at her, and said
cheerfully:</p>

<p>"Well, Emma, how are things going with you?"</p>

<p>"Much better, thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"That's good! Has your father been&mdash;more considerate?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"Not drinking so much?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"No violence?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"That's excellent. Now, is there anything else you want?"</p>

<p>Emma paused, and then remembered the object of her mission. She
said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Father was wondering last night if there was any light work you
could give me. He says I'm not strong enough to work in a factory,
or to go into a shop, but he thought there might be some light work
here in the offices, or something."</p>

<p>Rodney looked at her, and then examined his finger-nails.</p>

<p>"Oh! I see...Well, now, I wonder what we can do. There is very
little work here except clerical work, and hard charing. Let me
think."</p>

<p>He lighted a cigarette, and sat scratching with a pen on a piece
of blotting-paper. Suddenly he looked up and said:</p>

<p>"Look here: we have a tiny flat at Westminster. How would you
care to go there two or three days a week, and keep it clean for
us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You would? Well, we could arrange that. Are you doing anything
this morning?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, would you like to go along there now and see my brother?
He's working there this morning. If you like, I'll ring him up in
the meantime, and get him to make some sort of arrangement with
you. He uses the place more than I do. How would that do?"</p>

<p>Emma gave a little gasp, and managed to say, "Yes."</p>

<p>And that was how Emma first went to "The Pig-sty."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter 6&mdash;The Volga Boat
Song</h2>

<hr>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Querril's wedding anniversary was always celebrated
with a kind of furtive pomp. Little presents passed unobtrusively.
Mrs. Querril's sister Lena came and spent the night. She was a
clean-cut old lady, who, as Peter said, "glittered with virtues."
The Lemaires came to dinner, and this year there were two other
male visitors, John Capel, the young naval lieutenant; and an
American boy friend of Peter's from the Slade School. His name was
Tony MacDowell and he came from Boston. He had a flat, monkeyish
face, a slow drawl, and a great affection for Peter, whom he
resembled in many ways.</p>

<p>No reference was made to the anniversary. It was considered too
poignant a matter to talk about. Only when the girls kissed their
mother, they added a little extra pressure and murmured, "Darling,"
in a voice which signified that they understood. And the boys were
very playful and "Georgy" with their father, as though anxious to
impress him that he got younger every year, that he was more and
more one of them. And the dogs&mdash;much to their
disgust&mdash;received an extra grooming, and certain old friends
and relatives wrote sentimental letters from various parts of the
country. These letters were passed round and read without comment.
Decimus Postern could not be present, as he was taking the chair at
some literary club dinner, but he had called in the morning and
kissed Mrs. Querril's hand and made a speech in his best Corinthian
manner.</p>

<p>Mr. Querril was in excellent spirits. Mrs. Basingstoke had found
work for young Stallard on the farm of a gentleman in Sussex who
bred pedigreed pigs. The work was healthy and absorbing, and there
was nothing to be stolen. The responsibility had passed out of his
life.</p>

<p>He played "Watch Billy" with considerable acumen after dinner,
and was delighted with himself for detecting the missing card three
times under Capel's pack. Indeed, the young lieutenant was playing
rather abstractedly. Tony MacDowell proved a perfect demon at the
game. His face was quite expressionless, but his gray eyes had an
unerring instinct for detecting the pack where "Billy" lay
concealed. He explained that to any one who had played poker it was
like pushing a baby over a precipice.</p>

<p>They afterwards again adjourned to Peter's studio. And in order
that the emotions should not be too deeply stirred, trios and
quartettes were boycotted, and the gramophone was turned on
instead. Excerpts from musical comedies and ragtime were the order
of the night, and some of the children did some sketchy dancing.
And then George had to have "his piece." His piece was the "Volga
Boat Song," sung by a Russian male quartette. It was a very
beautiful record, and it always impressed Mr. Querril very much. He
enjoyed music that was definitely descriptive.</p>

<p>He liked to half-close his eyes and visualize the Volga boat
song. There was a great murky river, in the late evening, and a
group of barbaric men were huddled in the bows of a boat. He could
almost see the shallow bank, the long line of fir trees with the
moon just rising behind them. Away in the distance were the dim
lights of a large town that had been left behind. The rowers' faces
could not be seen, but he could hear the rhythmic beat of their
oars. The rowers were not singing. It was the group seated in the
bows. He could feel the sway of the boat as their voices died away
farther and farther across the river. They would almost vanish in
the mist gathering over the dark waters, and then they would appear
again, their song sounding more resonant and triumphant It was like
the song of man's triumph over his unhappy fate. It was a love song
surely, telling of the unquenchable fires that have burned through
that long calvary of suffering, the song of Russia. It was very
sad, very moving. Mr. Querril glanced round at his family, grouped
happily in that beautiful room.</p>

<p>A very wonderful and mysterious thing-art! To be able to bring
into the warm security of that nest the living vision of strange
men and places; to be able to move the steady pulse of restraint
and austerity into the wild rhythm of primitive emotion. And yet,
after all, wasn't all life moving to the same rhythm? Increasing
and slackening, rising and falling, telling its little story, and
then disappearing down the dark river?</p>

<p>The dark river! Mr. Querril glanced almost greedily around his
family group, as though affected by a sudden gust of apprehension.
There was a large group on the ottoman by the wall. Martin and
Joan, Annette with her head resting on Peter's shoulder, Tony
MacDowell sitting forward and frowning, and Rodney lying back
nonchalantly, with Evelyn leaning against his knees. His wife
knitting placidly, and Aunt Lena sitting rather rigidly in a chair
by her side. Mr. Lemaire standing by the wall, twirling his
mustache and looking at his beautiful wife as though he had
suddenly seen her for the first time, and had fallen in love. Yes,
they were all there...at least, no, apparently not Magda?
Apparently not young Capel?</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>But there was nothing very remarkable about this. People would
stray in and out, vanish for a time and reappear like the Volga
boatmen. Mr. Querril was not disturbed. He continued smoking his
pipe and listening to the music, sublimely unconscious of the fact
that at that identical moment his daughter Magda was being held
very tightly by a pair of strong arms, and that lips, when not
otherwise occupied, were murmuring:</p>

<p>"Magda, I love you...I love you."</p>

<p>And Magda was crying with the sheer wonder of it, the surprise,
the queer and dangerous ecstasy, in a land enchanted, although it
seemed to have nothing to do with the Querril world. On the very
seat, at the end of the garden, on which Peter had leaned, and
observed that the moon was too large, and made other philosophic
reflections, Magda was being field in a grip of steel. And it was
not the grip alone which made her bosom heave. Life itself had
rushed toward a sudden apostasy of Querril faith, something more
moving and tremendous. And she was unprepared. She could only
gasp:</p>

<p>"Darling, I don't know...I don't know."</p>

<p>There was no moon to-night, but the stars were very busy, and
the tall flowers nodded in the gentle wind. And the almost
invisible person, who brought with him something of the disturbing
and relentless character of the sea, insisted:</p>

<p>"Damn it! You angel, my leave's up tomorrow. Say yes. Say yes,
Magda..."</p>

<p>It was July, and the progress of emotional experiences which had
brought Magda face to 'ace with this distracting proposition had
covered a period of three weeks, corresponding with the leave of a
certain young lieutenant in the navy, where they are reputed to do
things rapidly.</p>

<p>At first it had all been so simple. A new member of the Querril
set, who could play tennis and make more noise than any of them,
who entered into all the rags, was tremendously high-spirited, and
yet tactful and charming in manner, altogether a delightful
acquisition. Magda liked his steady gray eye, the clean-cut
features and strong chin, and the keen way he moved, and the
infectious way be laughed. It bucked up "the set" tremendously. And
then as the days passed Magda realized that the steady gray eyes
had nothing impersonal about them. They were not concerned with
"the set." They singled her out and followed her every little
movement The strong chin and infectious laugh had a significance
for her alone. And this was very alarming, and it became more
alarming when she realized one night in bed that she wouldn't have
it otherwise for the world.</p>

<p>And then this person had an arbitrary, domineering way of doing
things that was alien to the set. It was as though he had suddenly
decided that he wasn't going to stand any nonsense about universal
love and the brotherhood of man. He caught hold of her one evening
and deliberately dragged her away for a walk on the heath
<i>alone</i>. And when out of sight, he said:</p>

<p>"Phew! It's a treat to get you away from your family!"</p>

<p>And Magda answered:</p>

<p>"You mustn't say anything about my family. They are
darlings."</p>

<p>"I know they're darlings, but they're a damned nuisance when
they keep you from me."</p>

<p>And that was the beginning of what might be called an intensive
courtship.</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The boys were busy on week days, and Evelyn was attending an art
school in the neighborhood, and so John made the most of those
golden hours. He took Magda for walks alone, and trips on a
side-car alone, and picnics alone, and even once up to London to a
matine alone. He was shameless in his campaign of unimpersonalism.
The only people who might have been annoyed were Annette and Joan,
at whose house he was staying. The affair was quite apparent to
them, but they were too loyal to make any comment, and if it was
going to materialize it would be too sacred to rag about. Only
Madame Lemaire, who was his aunt, and of whom he was very fond
(they always performed a ceremony of flirtation when they met and
parted), said to him one night:</p>

<p>"Aw-h! my Jack-ee! He is haveeng a verree, verree nice time. But
she is a verree, verree nice girl, eesn't she, my Jack-ee?"</p>

<p>And "Jack-ee" put his arm round her waist and kissed her, and
said:</p>

<p>"Oh, you Frenchwomen! you can only think of one thing."</p>

<p>When the significance of John's advances and her own feelings in
the matter had dawned upon Magda in their full significance, she
began to take herself seriously to task. It was not the Querril way
to be precipitate. It was all tremendously important. There would
be crowds of things to consider. First and foremost "the darlings"
(by which she meant Mr. and Mrs. Querril). The more she considered
John, the more she realized that he was a spirit from another
world. He was not really one of the Querril set, although he fitted
into it so well. Nearly all her friends were literary people,
artists, craftsmen, folk whose outlook was essentially towards
reform and socialism. John came from the social antipodes, the
conventional official world. The navy! an almost incredible
profession when you come to think of it, one that had to do
fundamentally with killing people! It would be necessary to be more
intimate with the mind of a man who chose killing as a profession,
if one were to be united to him for life. She could not conceive
Martin, or Rodney, or Peter, willingly choosing the navy or the
army as a profession. It was the kind of thing we were all moving
to eliminate from the world.</p>

<p>And yet John...She could not imagine John being cruel. He was
very considerate. He loved animals. He was careful not to hurt
people's feelings...It seemed somehow inconsistent, and Magda
decided on the next occasion when they found themselves alone to
talk to him seriously about it. The next occasion happened to be
the following afternoon when they started out to play golf, and
went into a bunker to look for a ball, and forgot to look for it,
and John was becoming rather a nuisance. Then she suddenly drew
herself away, and shook her first finger at him, and said:</p>

<p>"Now, John dear, listen. I want to talk to you about something
very important."</p>

<p>"Carry on, darling."</p>

<p>"It's about your...profession."</p>

<p>He looked surprised for the moment, and sat on his haunches,
clutching his ankles. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, I know it's a bit of a push. The pay's nothing to write
home about. Of course I We got a bit of my own&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you dear donkey! I don't mean anything to do with that. I
mean more...its moral side."</p>

<p>"Its moral side! The moral side of the navy!" exclaimed
Lieutenant John Capel incredibly.</p>

<p>Then she seized his hand and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, I know it's moral enough. It's just splendid. The sea life,
the discipline, the spirit of the whole thing. The sense of honor
one associates with it. I love all that side of it. It must be fine
or it wouldn't have produced <i>you</i>. No, leave me alone. The
only thing that worries me is...well, you know, at the back of it
all&mdash;killing people. I can't bear to think of that. I can't
bear to think of you killing people. I can't think why you went
into it. I suppose we're what are called humanitarians, cranks, or
whatever it is, but I can't get away from it. I want to know why
you...what compelled you to go into it."</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>For the first time since she had met him, she saw the face of
John Capel entirely grave. There was not even that ghost of a
twinkle in his eyes. His jaw seemed to shut with a snap.</p>

<p>She thought he was angry. But after a few moment's reflection he
said:</p>

<p>"My dear angel, this beats everything. The navy's the finest job
in the world. My old dad was a commodore on the China Station for
fifteen years. It's the finest job in the world."</p>

<p>He repeated this, as though he still could not credit that his
dear angel could have a serious argument against the existence of
the "finest job in the world," but she insisted:</p>

<p>"Yes, but answer my question. The killing..."</p>

<p>John Capel picked up a handful of sand and let it pour through
his fingers.</p>

<p>"Nobody likes killing. But the problem isn't as simple as all
that. This country would vanish without a navy. The history of
England is the history of the navy. You read your history from the
wrong end."</p>

<p>He suddenly pointed his arm in the direction of the Querrils'
house and said:</p>

<p>"You know your friends would never have got the ideas they have
about liberty and democracy, if it hadn't been for the navy. And
they'd never be able to hold them, and to air them-they're free to
say any damn thing they like!&mdash;if it weren't for the steel
ships mucking about in those dirty seas."</p>

<p>"Yes, that may be true. But suppose our government went to war
with another civilized government for political or capitalist
reasons. In your heart of hearts you might disapprove of the war.
How would you feel killing other boys, perhaps as sincere as
yourself."</p>

<p>He smiled at her puzzled face and answered:</p>

<p>"This is treason, goddess of the sand dunes; we don't have
political views in the navy. Looking at it broadly, we fight for
what we represent. We're only a tool of a people. And the business
of a people is to stamp its type on the world. It's evolution."</p>

<p>John Capel had no great gift for words, and he couldn't express
himself eloquently. And Magda was still not convinced. She nibbled
some beads on a long necklace that hung nearly to her waist. At
last she said, rather dubiously:</p>

<p>"I was wondering whether you couldn't get transferred to the
merchant service!"</p>

<p>And then the young man behaved most surprisingly. He started
almost angrily. The firm lines of his chin and mouth tautened. His
clear eyes expressed a sense of outrage. He stared at her, and
muttered incredibly:</p>

<p>"The <i>merchant</i> service! The <i>merchant</i> service!"</p>

<p>And Magda became aware, by a flash of revelation at that
instant, that if he had had to weigh his love for her against the
calls of his profession, it was she who would have had to be
sacrificed, although the sacrifice would break his heart. And he
looked so young, so boyish, so outraged, and yet so wistful, so
horribly wanting her-and she with the power to hurt him so! She
felt as though she were seeking to betray him, to offer him a bribe
for his honor. If we were to "stamp our type on the world," surely
the type of John Capel should be worthy to survive. And she felt
very proud that he was like that, and that it was she who had the
power to make him finer still. The sun poured down on them, and she
noticed the tiny fair hairs on his cheek just above the line where
he had shaved. And then he turned and looked at her again. And she
sighed and murmured:</p>

<p>"All right, you dear pirate, I suppose even if you nail a skull
and cross-bones to the mast I shall have to follow you through the
seven seas."</p>

<p>And in the subsequent proceedings which confirmed this
acquiescence the intensive courtship made considerable
progress.</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Indeed, it made such progress as to reach its appointed end on
the very night of Mr. and Mrs. Querril's wedding-anniversary, and
its announcement came rather in the nature of a bomb-shell. The
Volga boat song was finished. The party broke up and scattered
downstairs, the majority going to the dining-room to drink cocoa
and eat biscuits. Aunt Lena had already gone to bed, and Mr.
Querril had gone into the smoking-room to have a last pipe, and
read an article in "The Fortnightly" on "British Policy in the Far
East," when Magda and John came in quietly from the garden, and
John went straight in to Mr. Querril's room and shut the door. Mr.
Querril looked up and said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, John! Have some of my John Cotton? It's in rather good
condition."</p>

<p>And John replied:</p>

<p>"Mr. Querril, I'm sorry to bother you at this late hour, but my
leave is up to-morrow. I want to ask your consent. I've proposed to
Magda, and she has accepted me."</p>

<p>And Mr. Querril stared at him, as though expecting to hear the
announcement followed by a peal of laughter, or a clap of thunder.
As neither of these phenomena became apparent, he blushed, gasped,
and then exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You don't mean it!"</p>

<p>But there appeared to be nothing of an equivocating nature about
John Capel's face, although he was smiling confidently, so Mr.
Querril jumped up and pressed his forearm, and jerked out:</p>

<p>"My dear good fellow!"</p>

<p>And then he rushed to the door, and called out, "Mother!
Mother!" He seemed frightfully anxious to escape to the protection
of his wife. She came instantly, and then they both observed Magda
standing in the hall, looking flushed and excited, with one long
strand of hair on the left side running astray in a compromising
manner.</p>

<p>"What is it?" exclaimed Mrs. Querril, whose thoughts were
frequently occupied with street accidents happening to the darling
children.</p>

<p>"It seems&mdash;er&mdash;John here&mdash;proposed to
Magda&mdash;er&mdash;proposal for marriage and so on," stammered
Mr. Querril, who always detested "a situation."</p>

<p>Fortunately Mrs. Querril's technique for such an emergency was
more advanced. She held out her arms to Magda, and Magda rushed
into them, and they both kissed, and cried, and murmured,
"Darling," in unison. This lasted several minutes, and then Mrs.
Querril dabbed her eyes and embraced John. He felt her damp cheek
pressed against his, and he thought to himself:</p>

<p>"Evidently it's going to be all right."</p>

<p>Rumor has the reputation of a coquette, being volatile,
irresponsible, and having the faculty of always "getting there"
unaccountably. On this occasion it slithered quite easily across
the hall, and up and down the staircase. There was no general rush
or convocation. It happened easily and humidly. Evelyn was the
first to appear, and she too cried, and kissed them both.</p>

<p>Annette and Joan came in together, and also kissed John, and he
did not mind. And Mrs. Lemaire hugged him and looking into his eyes
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Aw-h! My beautiful faithless Jack-ee, and eet vas only las'
night you said you lofed me!"</p>

<p>"I'll always be able to sandwich that in, Aunt," replied the
sailor, who was too excited to be gallant. \</p>

<p>And then the boys straggled in one by one, and shook hands
rather self-consciously, and muttered congratulations. Tony
MacDowell seemed a little indifferent. (As a matter of fact, Tony,
who had only been there once or twice, was already making his own
preparations to fall in love with Magda. ) And he found himself
taken upstairs to see Aunt Lena. She came out of her room, in a
uniform that was either a mackintosh or a dressing-gown, and
said:</p>

<p>"I understand I'm to congratulate you, Mr. Capel. Has Mr.
Querril given his consent?"</p>

<p>And John replied quite truthfully:</p>

<p>"As far as I can make out, Madame."</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was very conscious of not having done the
engagement business in quite the right way. It was a <i>faux
pas</i>. He ought to have prepared the ground more. He had
perverted a sacred rite which ought decently to have gone on for
two or three years, into a very crude theatrical performance. An
intensive courtship was rather an indelicate affair. Moreover, it
was unfortunate to have announced it on the very night of the
wedding anniversary. The news would be disturbing to "the
darlings," and might tend to make them feel they were getting
older. An engaged daughter! It would keep them awake at night.</p>

<hr>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>And indeed Mr. Querril did lie awake some time. He peeped across
at his wife once or twice (they occupied separate beds), and he
thought to himself:</p>

<p>"Poor Jenny! This will mean a lot of worry to her. I do hope she
will sleep. So sudden, so very, very sudden. A dear good fellow,
John! but...precipitate. We hardly know him. It must have been
developing under our very noses, and we hadn't suspected. Of course
one's children grow up, but...it's a great trial for the mother.
Dear me, I don't believe any one let Potash out..."</p>

<p>And on her side Mrs. Querril was thinking:</p>

<p>"My poor George! How this will upset him! He adores my darling
Magda. What a very peculiar way of announcing an engagement! So
unprepared we were. Of course he's a gentleman through and through,
any one can see that. His people too, we know; they're nice kind
people. I believe there's a bishop in the family somewhere, but oh,
dear! George will never think any one is good enough for our Magda!
He'll never say so, though. Of course it's natural; we all get
older and older. The children develop, but it's hard on the father
to lose them like that. What a lot there will be to think about!
There will be frocks to make, and other things..."</p>

<p>She peered above the sheets, and said quietly:</p>

<p>"Where are you going, George?"</p>

<p>"I don't think any one let Potash out, darling."</p>

<p>Mrs. Querril sighed.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't bother, darling; he's been running about the garden
all the evening."</p>

<p>Magda was not sure whether she slept or not, or whether the
dreams which came to her were real or not, but she was floating
away over sunlit waters with a pirate crew. They were desperate
fellows with bandaged heads, and ear-rings, and grinning teeth, and
they sang wild songs and told her about an island they were taking
her to. She was rather frightened of them&mdash;they gesticulated
and they were armed with knives and pistols!&mdash;but her dream of
the island was such a beautiful dream that the journey seemed-worth
while.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter 7&mdash;The Intensive
Courtship</h2>

<hr>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>It was during this month of July that a distinct psychological
development took place in Peter. That period about the twenties is
always one in which the heart is apt to outrun the brain. It is an
age to be an evangelist, a remaker of the world, or a sensualist.
Tremendous impulses come pushing up from underneath, and there is
sometimes not sufficient mentality to adjust them. One is attacked
by an idea, one half-understands it, or reads a smattering of some
one else's opinion upon it, and at once becomes a whole-hog
champion. It is regrettable that when we have attained a greater
power of adjustment we lose that enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The movement attacked Peter in a surprising form&mdash;he began
by becoming a critic of his own family! Of the development of that
amazing impulse we shall read later on, but its inception was
undoubtedly due to his association with two people, Emma Troon and
Tony MacDowell.</p>

<p>With Tony MacDowell it was a spiritual association. Peter was a
philosopher, but Tony was a super-philosopher, a seer, a prophet, a
wise-man-from-the-West; a combination of the "teachings of
Confucius" and some technical trade catalogue. He knew everything,
from the profit Mr. Gillette made on each of his safety
razor-blades to the emotions of a woman in childbirth. Moreover, he
had a quiet, unobtrusive way of asserting himself. His
generalizations were like his face, flat and broad. His expressions
were pungent and forceful. He and Peter went out to lunch nearly
every day from the Blade, and sometimes they wandered the streets
together, and dined in little Soho restaurants. And what Peter and
Tony did not know about life was not worth recording. The theories
they evolved together about men and women, about sociology and art,
and liberty and love, and other trivial matters, were always
startling and left no loopholes for further argument. And Peter
found that he became much more intimate with Tony than he was with
either Martin or Rodney. He was less self-conscious in discussing
certain matters with him than with his brothers.</p>

<p>And one day in a tea-shop in the Strand Tony said: "You know,
Pete, your people <i>are</i> too sweet. I don't mean in the
jollying sense, I mean that they really are too sweet. Family life
is the finest thing in the world&mdash;it's certainly the
happiest&mdash;but it can be overdone. Biologically it's bad when
it harries the individual power of expression. Each one of your
bunch ought to be taken and dumped down separately into one of
those New Mexican towns where you live right down on the raw all
the time. If you're a gentleman you come through; if you're not a
gentleman you go under. Your lot would come through because they're
gentlemen&mdash;I don't mean the girls&mdash;I'm just talking of a
type. What it doesn't allow for&mdash;this attitude I mean, this
Querril outlook&mdash;is that in all the big things in life one has
to act <i>alone</i>. In every adventure, in every experience, there
comes a moment when one has suddenly to weigh a chance, make a
quick decision&mdash;and one has to do that&mdash;alone. And in the
end one has to stand before the bar of God&mdash;alone. I don't
really mean a bar, and I don't quite know what I mean by God, but
there must come a moment when one is all collected together, all
one's life and impulses and temptations&mdash;one's whole story, in
fact&mdash;and then all these others only exist in the way that
they affected us or we affected them. One must be terribly alone
then. And this mutual self-effacing business is bad for a race.
Unselfishness becomes selflessness. Don't imagine yon only find
Querrils dotted about in these lime-washed villas in Surrey. They
're a by-product of an age which has been so long lulled by
refinement and security that it has forgotten how it arrived. There
are crowds of Querrils hunched around Boston and even way out at
Los Angeles. But it's essentially an Anglo-Saxon production. You
don't find it on the Continent of Europe so much, because there the
people&mdash;owing to their geographical position&mdash;always have
the fear of God on them."</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>These words gave Peter food for reflection. At the same time his
mind was much occupied with Emma. He saw her two or three times a
week at "The Pig-sty," and she was becoming more and more of an
obsession. Before he awakened in the morning his senses would
become colored by some pleasurable excitement, and then when he was
fully conscious he realized what it was. He thought of Emma and
made love to her in his dreams. When he came into actual contact
with her, his efforts were not so successful. He shook with a very
palsy of self-consciousness. He looked at her timidly and stabbed
the air with brief commonplaces and halting questions. The position
was all the more galling because Emma herself seemed to be losing
some of her shyness. She was more talkative than he. She always
seemed to be watching for him, and when he arrived and shut himself
in the sitting-room, she would come and tap on the door and ask him
some question. Then she would stand there by the door and look at
him with a pensive agitation in her eyes, and quite cleverly make
further need for questions and replies. At this time, too, she
appeared to be better dressed, and in better health. She always
wore a clean print apron, and she had neat shoes which displayed a
very pretty ankle. Her father, it appeared, was much better. He had
been quite kind to her, and had given her the shoes and also the
new skirt and blouse.</p>

<p>Peter always kicked himself that he cut so poor a figure at
these interviews. And yet, what was he to do? It would be quite
easy to make love to her, quite easy and quite-caddish!</p>

<p>For it must never be forgotten that Peter was nothing if not a
philosopher. This was his first serious excursion into the realms
of Eros. He knew nothing about these things. His father had told
him nothing, and he never discussed them with his brothers. The
boys had never even been allowed to risk the perils of a public
school. So that all Peter knew, he knew from intuition, from books,
and from his own observation of men and women. His intuition told
him that he was very much in love with Emma, his book-reading told
him that there were at least two kinds of love, and his observation
of men and women perceived&mdash;rather annoyingly-that this was
probably "the other kind" of love, and his masterly philosophy kept
on insisting that in any case it wouldn't do. The philosophy was
indeed relentless on the point. At all kinds of odd moments it
would jog him with:</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Peter. You know perfectly well it won't
do."</p>

<p>Magda's engagement to young Capel vivified these conclusions. He
could not help comparing Emma with Magda, and it was rather hard on
Emma. Emma in the Querril household would be an inconceivable
anomaly. It would break "the darlings'" hearts. No, he would never
be able to marry Emma, consequently to make love to her would be
caddish. It must be acknowledged that Peter at twenty was a better
philosopher than might be expected.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the <i>impasse</i> embittered him. He was
unreasonably annoyed with his family that they thus held silent
watch at the outer barrier of his desires, and Tony's words about
"the Querril outlook" helped to sharpen his critical faculty. Was
it possible that the Querril family were not perfect after all?
Peter became more moody, and more observant.</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>One day Peter mounted a bus on the way to Westminster. Opposite
to him sat a fair girl with short curly hair and gray eyes. She was
young and pretty. She might have been a dancer. For some reason or
other Peter could not take his eyes from her, and he was aware that
she was looking at him with little furtive peeps. It was a long
journey, and as it proceeded he observed that her eyes became
merrier and more inviting. She smiled and then looked away, and the
intervals when she turned away became gradually of shorter and
shorter duration. A few turnings before his she got up and stood on
the backboard of the bus, and hovered there like a small bird about
to take flight but still avid for the crumbs that yet may fall.
When she got off she stood on the pavement, and peeped back into
the bus, smiled quite candidly, and gave a little movement of her
head that if not an invitation was nothing at all. Peter felt his
heart beating rapidly, but he sat still. After the bus had left
this dainty morsel out of sight, he wondered whether he had not
been a fool. The girl haunted him for the rest of the day, and the
air retained a tingling memory of her.</p>

<p>He never saw this fair girl with the gray eyes again, but she
supplied another faggot for the philosopher to burn beneath the
caldron of his experience. During the brief incident, the grip
which Emma held upon his emotions was entirely relaxed. Emma indeed
ceased to exist. It is true that the visions of Emma started again
when the recollections of the other girl had dimmed.</p>

<p>"But," he thought, "is it possible to fall in love with some one
you have never spoken to?"</p>

<p>"The whole thing is just a calf business," he decided. In truth,
had he ever spoken to Emma? Was there any real difference in the
two cases? 'When he had persuaded himself in the best Socratic
manner that there was not, he was relieved and wretched at the same
time. He avoided Westminster, and painted low-toned landscapes with
furious abandon. Over the week-ends the tennis parties went on as
usual, and the Querrils entertained their friends, and lay in
hammocks, and went for strolls on the heath, invented new games,
and studied each other with adoring solicitude. And at night under
the shade of the orange lamp, they would lie huddled in little
groups, worshipping their gods, and sublimely ignorant of the bolts
of Jove&mdash;as impersonated by Mr. Jim Troon. The summer holidays
were being discussed, a most absorbing topic...</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>It was eventually decided to go to Sheringham, and for a very
characteristic reason. It happened that one evening George was
undergoing a dose of Mr. Stride. He was in one of his most trying
moods. It appeared that he had to meet his sister later on at some
town on the east coast, and he was complaining bitterly. He
detested the east coast and hadn't a word to say in its favor. So
Mr. Querril, in order to hearten his guest, spoke enthusiastically
about the delights of Cromer and Sheringham, places which he really
disliked. No one had been listening to Mr. Stride, but Evelyn
happened to hear George's panegyric. She immediately conceived the
idea that her father wanted to go to Sheringham, and she reported
the matter to Magda. And Magda told Martin, and Martin told Rodney,
and an inner ring was formed to work out the conspiracy. None of
the children liked the east coast, but at dinner the conversation
was worked round to the question, and the boys talked as though
they were tired of their traditional Babington in Devonshire and
wanted a change, and Evelyn said she had heard that Sheringham was
"simply ripping."</p>

<p>Mr. Querril, overhearing the conversation, said to his wife
afterwards:</p>

<p>"I believe the children want to go to the east coast, my
dear."</p>

<p>And Mrs. Querril, who was in the know, but who was advised not
to express an opinion because it might be suspected (she never had
any personal predilections about anything), said:</p>

<p>"Yes, it would be a nice change, dear. What do you think?"</p>

<p>And so it came about that the whole family went away to a place
that not one of them wanted to visit. However, the holiday was
eventually postponed till September, owing to the volcanic action
of Magda's fiance, who suddenly wrote that he had "wangled another
bit of leave" for the third week in August, and urged for the
wedding to take place then. Mr. Querril did indeed make some mild
protest about the inadvisability of marrying in haste, but the
lieutenant was inexorably plausible in his demands. There was no
real reason against it In fact there were very strong reasons in
favor of it. Among others it appeared that an uncle, who had made a
will in John's favor, was anxious to make over a considerable sum
of money to him on his marriage. He was a very old gentleman with a
kind heart and noble disposition, who enjoyed seeing young people
about him (and incidentally the arrangement dodged the iniquitous
death-duties recently introduced by a scoundrelly Radical
Government).</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>The wedding took place in the local church, a building never
previously entered by any member of the family. It took place in
the church because the family believed that Mrs. Querril believed
that it was unlucky not to be married in a church, and also because
Aunt Lena would be shocked, and certain dear friends might think a
registrar's office "funny."</p>

<p>Magda wore a dark-blue traveling frock, and the other members of
the family wore their usual clothes. There was indeed a desperate
effort on that day to appear "usual." John; of course, was in naval
uniform, and he brought with him a certain Captain Lambleton, a
breezy giant and a gunnery expert, as best man. The two naval
officers appeared to the Querrils almost to strike a note of
discord. They seemed to judge a wedding as a festival of joy and
fun. Even John, on this most sacred and moving occasion, appeared
to be light-hearted and gay. And the captain was a most
irrepressible person, and he evidently meant to see it through in
the real wedding spirit. Although he had never met any of them
before, he kissed Magda, and Evelyn, and Mrs. Querril in the
vestry, and even Annette, whom he pretended to think another
sister. He concealed his surprise at finding no champagne at
luncheon, but it did not affect his high spirits, and he laughed
like a tempest, and made love industriously to all the ladies,
scoring most successfully perhaps with Mrs. Lemaire.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that this lack of champagne was not
meanness on the part of Mr. Querril, nor was it done on principle.
It was merely all part of the day's campaign of "usualness." A
little whisky was always kept in the house for visitors, and there
was generally a rather vinegary claret, which nobody drank, and
even a little port. But this was to be essentially a normal
occasion, and on normal occasions they never had anything to drink
except water for lunch and coffee afterwards.</p>

<p>And so at the luncheon&mdash;or the breakfast, as it is called
by people who have champagne&mdash;they sat round the table and
were unusually usual, talking volubly and striving to enter into
the playful badinage of John and the captain, but all the time
being tremulously observant of Magda and of each other. Magda
herself was perhaps the most successful. Her cheeks were flushed,
and her eyes were bright, but they would occasionally wander to her
mother's dear face, and to little Evelyn, whom she was leaving for
the first time, and to "darling George," and to all the boys, each
with some little personal niche and intimacy for her. How sad it is
that in all these great experiences we can't take all those we love
with us! At least that was one of her momentary reflections.
(Whether it would have been endorsed by John is open to
conjecture.)</p>

<p>And Mrs. Querril, the cynosure of sympathetic glances, was
thinking:</p>

<p>"Dear, dear, so little Magda's going! That's the first! I'm sure
he'll be kind to her. That blue frock suits her, but how badly Miss
Peewit has cut the yoke..."</p>

<p>And Evelyn thought:</p>

<p>"Darling mother, what a wrench it will be for her! How strange
it seems; Magda to-day is just Magda, to-morrow she will be some
one quite different. She is going away to live with a man&mdash;a
man we hardly know. She'll be his companion, his best friend,
his...bedfellow (how awful that seems!). I hope the darlings won't
worry too much. How noisy the captain is! almost ribald..."</p>

<p>At length the married couple took their departure. They drove to
the station in a one-horse fly. (Chessilton Heath boasted of only
three, as the majority of people had their own cars.) It was an
affecting farewell, and Mrs. Querril was allowed to cry a little,
and the captain kissed every one again, and Magda was very brave,
and the dogs barked, and the vehicle ambled out of sight for all
the world as though conveying the products of intensive courtships
and rushed weddings were as usual as conveying old Mr. Dither from
the station to the golf clubhouse, where he could disburse the
mellow chestnuts garnered during a hard day's loafing in the
political clubs.</p>

<hr>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>And when they had gone, the Querril family strolled about the
drawing-room and the garden and behaved more usually than ever. So
keyed up and solicitous of each other were they that they could do
nought else. Evelyn and the Lemaire girls talked to Mrs. Querril
nearly all the afternoon about the cut of Magda's yoke, and
dressmakers and dressmaking. And Mr. Querril talked to Mr.
Lemaire&mdash;who had taken the day off for the
occasion&mdash;about a new book that had just come out on the life
of Mr. Gladstone. And the boys played clock-golf on the corner of
the lawn, and smoked innumerable pipes and cigarettes.</p>

<p>Decimus Postern alone seemed abnormal and unusual. He sat apart,
a heaving volcano of melancholy. The master of words had nothing to
say. All through the day he had been depressed and silent, and now
he looked like some Gargantuan baby on the verge of tears. He gave
himself away distressingly.</p>

<p>It is a peculiar attribute of certain florid characters that,
when they are stung to experience a real emotion, they become as
simple as little children. And Decimus had got it badly.</p>

<p>Living as he did in a world of words, among sparkling
acquaintanceships, and jolly good fellows of transient affections,
and elbowing his way about in a profession of papier-mch emotions
he found in the atmosphere of the Querrils a soothing benefaction,
something which touched him profoundly. They were so genuinely
loving. He had known them a long time, and he was very fond of
them. He very seldom talked to them intimately, but he liked to sit
there and listen to their voices. They warmed him with their
kindness and sincerity. And then, of course, he gradually began to
realize that Magda's voice warmed him most of all. He would sit
there with his eyes half closed and listen to Magda calling across
the garden, talking to the dogs, or mothering her mother. Her voice
was musical, caressing, finely attuned to every shade of
expression. And then more slowly he realized that her face was just
the same, and that indeed everything about Magda was fine-drawn,
wonderfully poised...adorable.</p>

<p>He wondered at times whether he had been deceived; whether this
mystic sense of enjoying an enveloping atmosphere was simply due to
the fact that he loved Magda. The Querrils were just an atmosphere
surrounding Magda. He had liked them all this time because they
encompassed that central figure with its definite individual grip
on himself. But, however it may have been, Decimus had nursed his
hopeless infatuation through several long years. And it was one of
the few things about which he had no illusions. He was eighteen
years older than Magda, a porpoise in love with a flower. His fame
and the glamour of his personality had never by the slightest
flutter affected her attitude toward him. It was always "dear old
Decimus." And dear old Decimus had visualized this day, and dreaded
it, and&mdash;words seemed dead things in the Querrils' garden. In
his silent reverie he was later on assisted by a fellow sufferer.
Tony MacDowell strolled up and took a deck chair by his side, and
remained comfortably mute. The family and the Lemaires went out for
a walk, and still this oddly assorted pair sat side by side in
silence. At length Tony said:</p>

<p>"Say, Dess, I wouldn't like to attend a funeral in this house."
Receiving no reply, he added, "I see it's got you fair
beat&mdash;like me."</p>

<p>This candid confession seemed to demand no corroboration, and
the large man remained puffily silent.</p>

<p>At length Tony continued:</p>

<p>"Anyway, it will be a bully thing for the Querrils&mdash;this
wedding. It's just what was wanted. That young man is the real
goods."</p>

<p>Another interval and then:</p>

<p>"They interest me enormously, these Querrils. They're one of
God's luxuries, and I'm not convinced yet that He can afford it. If
the world were all Querrils, well and good. But...there's something
about it almost sociologically perverted, like an attempt to divert
the natural channels of human expression. It's a force which
ignores the element of conflict in social evolution. They're
amateurs at life. It's dangerous."</p>

<p>Decimus blinked at the white gables of the house, and Tony
continued:</p>

<p>"They eat each other up. It's the herd-instinct carried to a
phenomenal degree. It frightens me. You never know what's coming
out of it. By God! those photographs! It's like Pandora's box from
which all the evils of the world may flow."</p>

<p>The large man stirred, and turned his humid eyes to his
companion, and spoke at last:</p>

<p>"It's quite true, Tony; all the evils of the world may flow from
it. But you must complete your analogy. The world may yet be saved
by amateurs. There was something else at the bottom of Pandora's
box."</p>

<p>"I'm a bit rusty on my myths. What was it?"</p>

<p>"Hope!"</p>

<hr>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>In the meantime the family and the Lemaires were strolling on
the heath, keeping close together, but changing company
continuously as though they were afraid of becoming too intimate
with each other's thoughts. They flicked the surface of every
discussion and talked at length about the captain. That gentleman
would have been pleased and flattered if he had known what an asset
he was to the family for the rest of the day. Having once opened
the subject, they talked about him interminably. They felt freer
and more natural. He was like a vast, impersonal force that did not
affect the fundamentals. He was so outside them that he did not
matter. They did not appreciate him till hours after he had gone,
but when they did he was a veritable godsend.</p>

<p>In awkward pauses they would rail Mrs. Lemaire about flirting
with him, and she would exclaim:</p>

<p>"Oh! But he was a pair-feect dar-leeng!"</p>

<p>And then they could laugh quite comfortably.</p>

<p>The Lemaires stayed to dinner, and that assertive gap in the
table, the seat that darling Magda always occupied, was
unobtrusively filled by Mr. Lemaire. They did not like to play
games afterwards. Magda always presided at games and she was so
good at them. Neither would music do. Music, that terrible wizard
who pulled the strings of the heart. And so they sat about and
talked, and Tony gave a description of duck-hunting on Lake
Michigan in the early morning, and the wonderful breakfasts you
could eat afterwards of "hen-fruit," fried potatoes, and flannel
cakes. Decimus had disappeared, and Tony explained that he had
taken him home and put him to bed.</p>

<p>There was a distressing little incident later on. Among the
minor fads of the family, Magda, Evelyn, and Peter always had cocoa
last thing at night, and Magda invariably had biscuits with anchovy
paste. A maid automatically brought these delicacies into the
drawing-room at half-past ten. And on this occasion she
thoughtlessly brought everything in as usual. With great presence
of mind Martin slipped the third cup behind a photograph frame
before Mrs. Querril had observed it, but the anchovy biscuits lay
incriminately for every one to observe. Darling Magda! Where was
she now?</p>

<p>Everything seemed to imply that Magda had gone forever. But a
naval officer labors under a great marital disadvantage. He cannot
take his wife to sea with him, and the only time they can have
together is his leave. It was arranged that they should go to
Lynmouth and then prospect for a flat at Chelsea for future
eventualities. At the end of his leave Magda would return to
Chessilton Heath indefinitely.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact she had gone away for only ten days.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter 8&mdash;Sacre Du
PrintempS</h2>

<hr>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>It is strange how sometimes a trivial thing, like a conversation
between Mr. Querril and Mr. Stride about the salubrious benefits of
the east coast, may be the indirect means of affecting not only the
immediate happiness but the future welfare and fate of a whole
group of people.</p>

<p>It is probable that if the family had followed their traditional
policy and gone to the placid village of Babington, the normal
tenor of their lives would have followed its accustomed course
indefinitely.</p>

<p>But it happened that the month of September was a particularly
robustious one at Sheringham. For the first two weeks they were
hardly ever free from a strong wind from the northeast, which was
very invigorating but which got on the nerves after a time. And
during the third week it rained heavily. Mr. Querril, Martin, and
Evelyn all developed colds and had to stay in bed for some days.
The furnished house they had taken proved not to be weatherproof,
and the wind rattled the windows and doors. Moreover, they had come
quite unprepared for this kind of experience. They had not enough
warm things, and Mr. Querril's mackintosh cape and heavy boots were
at the flat in Westminster. It was eventually decided that one of
the boys should go up to town to collect these things, and also to
attend to one or two matters of business for Mr. Querril. At first
Rodney was going and then on the morning he developed a chill, and
so the lot fell to Peter.</p>

<p>It was an arrangement which Peter accepted with alacrity. He was
indeed becoming rapidly bored with Sheringham. He felt extremely
well and virile, but cramped and restless. He could not paint, and
the golfiness and villaishness of the place annoyed him. They had
no other friends there&mdash;the Lemaires had gone to Etaples, and
Tony was in Holland painting black-and-white cattle and canals and
wind-mills in the Maris manner.</p>

<p>One day he went for a walk by himself, and the horrid
realization came to him that his own family were getting on his
nerves! It was a treasonable reflection, but a true one. They were
thrown so much together here, and there was nothing to do, and
interminable games indoors began to pall, and Peter found himself
listening and more and more frequently criticizing. "Darling
George" was very limited in some ways. He wished Magda&mdash;who
had rejoined them after her honeymoon&mdash;and Evelyn wouldn't
<i>schwren</i> so. Martin and Rodney were both tryingly
self-satisfied at moments. He yearned for Tony, or for some
influence to counteract this assured goodness and sweetness. Of
course they <i>were</i> good and sweet and quite sincere. It wasn't
a pose. It was quite natural to them.</p>

<p>Peter went for long tramps by himself, and tried to work off his
own perverse mood, and so he did. But on his return, back it would
come again. And he became as disgusted with himself as he was with
them. And he couldn't explain it. It was as though some monk in a
cloistered sanctuary away up in the hills, who had listened to the
<i>campanella</i> every day of his life, suddenly <i>heard</i> it
for the first time. And its beat no longer conveyed to him the
expression of the calm beauty of the evening, but whispered to him
of a world down in the valley, a place so disturbing that it
prompted him to doubt his fate.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>And one day he had stood on a promontory overlooking the sea.
The wind was blowing half a gale, and the angry sea appeared to be
attacking the land, lashing its way between the clefts of rock. The
sky above was a scurrying movement of grayness and menace, and the
gulls went screaming against the wind, as though this frenzied
conflict stimulated them. And Peter stood there, holding on to a
rock, and thought:</p>

<p>"It's all very big."</p>

<p>And the very bigness seemed to him inspiring. He must have
appeared a very small person perched up there on the rock, wrapped
up in his mackintosh and cap, with his tuft of brown hair blowing
free. And he too, like the gulls, felt the thrill of conflict. It
was tremendous! The breezes were charged with the stuff that makes
sagas, and legends, and operas, and the great moving dramas that
have rocked the living world. It made him realize the origin of
myths. Life was conflict. It wasn't all goodness and sweetness, nor
even philosophy. It was something bigger. It even had the faculty
at times of making these things seem trivial and small. There was a
genius of life itself, somewhere beyond good and evil...</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>On the day when he went up to London he arrived early in the
afternoon. He went straight to Mr. Querril's office, and transacted
the few small business matters (and heard incidentally that young
Stallard had run away from the pig-farm and there was no trace of
him). At four o'clock he was free for the day, and London lay
temptingly before him. The pavements were wet, but the sun shone
fitfully between light clouds. He felt interested and curiously
satisfied. The streets were throbbing with life. He determined to
have an evening of selfish introspective delights. He would mingle
in this living mass, and enjoy his own detached visions. He would
no anything that came into his head. He would be a pilgrim in
search of salvation. He would forget all about his family and the
troubles of a philosopher who had got to the end of his tether. He
would drift and enjoy.</p>

<p>He dined early, in Soho, at a restaurant that Tony and he had
often favored. There he ran into a young engaged couple from
Chessilton Heath. They invited him to sit at their table, and he
could hardly refuse, although he knew he would not be wanted. They
emphasized his lonely mood by talking to him politely and absently,
but their eyes devouring each other's all the time. They had
tickets for a theater, and he watched them go, a little enviously.
They were so oblivious to the world, so centered on each other.
<i>That</i> must be a wonderful experience.</p>

<p>How should he amuse himself till bedtime? He sat smoking and
thinking, and then his eye lighted on a handbill advertising the
Russian ballet at Covent Garden.</p>

<p>He had never seen the Russian ballet, but he had heard Magda and
Rodney and some of the others say it was "simply too lovely for
words." He was not in the mood to accept their verdict
unquestioningly. On the contrary, he felt a pugnacious disposition
to criticize, to assert himself. But the idea of a ballet appeared
to him at the moment as intriguing as any other form of diversion.
He went out into the streets. London seemed very full for the time
of year. People had probably been driven back by the bad weather.
It was always rather exciting, this friction of passing humanity.
At the corner of Leicester Square two men in evening dress were
passing him when one suddenly called out:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Querril!"</p>

<p>He turned and discovered a young man who lived at Chessilton
Heath. His name was Carling and he was the son of a wealthy oil
magnate. He seemed to be in a riotously merry mood. He clapped
Peter on the back, and introduced him to his friend "Major Yates."
Then he put his arm through Peter's and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"We were just going into the Leicester, lounge."</p>

<p>Peter had a sudden stab of misgiving.</p>

<p>"This is a bit thick," he thought. He had never been into such a
place in his life, and the rapid vision of the horrified faces of
his family flashed before him. And then he thought:</p>

<p>"After all, what does it matter? There's no harm in seeing what
these people do."</p>

<p>He found himself in a gorgeously upholstered room upstairs, and
drinking some pernicious green liquid out of a small glass. The
room was crowded with men and women, and the women predominated.
They sat at little round tables, staring vacuously hither and
thither. Their eyes had the hard, pleading expression of the victim
that has lost everything except the gambler's hope, and a
self-deceptive faith that the game itself is worth playing for the
sake of the seven pieces of silver.</p>

<p>Peter felt hot and ashamed. A pale girl, younger than some of
the others, sitting at a table near by, roused his pity. The major
spoke to her, and she smiled mechanically, and Peter wished he had
not seen the turgid misery welling up in her eyes. While his
friends were thus occupied, he slipped out.</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>He was late at Drury Lane, and one ballet was already over, and
they were half through "Prince Igor." He had not time to grasp any
idea of story. He was suddenly plunged into a world of barbaric
vibration. Savage warriors, and women, and princes, in a rhythm
that was new to him, whirled across the stage in what appeared at
first an uncontrolled riot. It was not till he had watched it for
some moments that he realized that it was one of the most cunningly
conceived, well-ordered riots the mind of man had ever invented. He
had never heard such music, never seen such color, such daring
schemes adroitly interdependent. It was as though passion herself
were expressing the gay plumage of the senses in terms of the
theater. And Peter thought to himself:</p>

<p>"But this is an entirely new art&mdash;a new human
experience."</p>

<p>He was still trembling with the emotion it had produced in him,
when the curtain went up on "Les Sulphides."</p>

<p>He was immediately translated to the gentler nuance of
cultivation. The moonlit garden in a Watteau monochrome. Music
which he knew and loved. Shepherds, and lovers, fauns and satyrs,
and little amourettes among the trees. An almost passionless grace.
Men and women and statues equally adorable, equally artificial, and
touching the surface of life like butterflies who ought to be in
bed. And yet how dear it was! how satisfying! And if the age was
artificial, the music of Chopin could strike a deeper note. And in
the dim garden the faces of women were beautiful, and hearts were
beating beneath those artificial clothes and cultivated manners,
and art could be very vital, perhaps more vital because it had here
the very media of the theater, the paint and powder of lyrical
expression.</p>

<p>When it was over, Peter sank back, tingling with a sense of
satisfaction and happiness, but his appetite whetted for fresh
experiences. The last item was called on the program "Le Sacre du
Printemps," and the contrast was cleverly conceived. There was a
sudden blare of discord which raged continuously till the curtain
went up. He then beheld an archaic scene. In a primitive landscape
which might have been painted by a child of six, a woman was tied
to a stake. Men in red cloaks were stamping up and down in little
groups. This monotonous beat went on and on, and Peter wondered
when it was going to stop. It was horrible, insistent, impressive.
The lighting was crude and toneless, there were no half tones, no
contrasts, no lights and shadows&mdash;just the victim and a crowd
of savage, bearded men. They swayed backwards and forwards, broke
up into various groups, and then rejoined. Others came in, priests
and acolytes, all dressed in primary colors. The dance raged, but
the monotonous rhythm never varied. It seemed to express
perpetuity, the primordial lust of man, coming through the ages,
demanding his victim. Women came on in black, to weep over their
sister, but the woman at the stake never moved all through the act.
Beads of perspiration stood on Peter's brow. He felt that he could
not stand it. And suddenly he seemed to see her as though she and
the other woman he had just seen at the caf were one and the same
person. She had the same listless apathy, the same pale, haunted
face. Beat, beat, beat, went the feet of the worshipers whose god
demanded this unholy sacrifice. They seemed to be getting hungrier,
more avid for the grim business. More and more men appeared,
growling and moving in and out. Sometimes the music would sway as
though about to break into some more melodic phrase, but always it
came back to the rhythm of an inexorable purpose. And the woman
gave no sign. Suddenly as though the god were tired of this
drawn-out jest, he struck the hour of doom, and the men drew away
in a great circle, and then with a feral cry they rushed to the
center, and threw the victim on a shield and held her towards the
sun. The sacrifice of spring!</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>When Peter arrived at the flat that evening he felt that
something fundamental had happened to him. He had gained something
and lost something, but he had gained more than he had lost.
Nothing would ever be quite the same again. He was more of a
person. He lighted a cigarette and drank some lithia water. He
swelled with a kind of assertive pride. A hundred little visions
and impulses crowded his mind, things he meant to do, pictures he
meant to paint, attitudes he intended to take up with regard to
certain big issues, particularly as far as they concerned his
family. He formed a resolution that in future he would always say
exactly what he thought at home, even if it hurt their feelings.
Anything else was a mistake. The home life of the Querrils was a
small, circumscribed affair. It wanted expanding.</p>

<p>About some of his impulses he was vague, but one stood out
conspicuously. It was a desire to champion woman, to be chivalrous.
The lot of woman was pitiable. She was handicapped by Nature, and
man had laid a prehensile grip upon this disadvantage. He had her
well in tow.</p>

<p>Peter smoked another cigarette and thought big, philosophic
thoughts, and then he turned out the light and went to bed. In
spite of the riotous evening, he went to sleep almost at once. He
had no idea how long he had slept when he was aware of a
disturbing, knocking sound. He opened his eyes and listened. Some
one was tapping furiously on the outside door of the flat. He rose
and walked in his pajamas to the door and opened it. In the doorway
stood Emma.</p>

<p>Her face was pale and scared, and she carried a small parcel.
She almost pushed past him, as she whispered hoarsely:</p>

<p>"For God's sake let me in!"</p>

<p>He opened the door wider, and admitted her.</p>

<p>"What is it? What's the trouble, Emma?"</p>

<p>She stood panting by him, with one hand on her heart. Then she
started crying.</p>

<p>The boy rested his hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Don't cry. Tell me what is it, Emma."</p>

<p>"He's turned me out! He's turned me out! I believe he's
following me. Oh, Mr. Peter!"</p>

<p>"That's all right. Keep calm. I'll look after you."</p>

<p>Peter slipped on a heavy coat hanging on the door and ran down
the stairs in his bedroom slippers, switching on the electric light
as he passed. The outside door was shut, but he opened it and
looked out into the street. No one was in sight. It was a warm
night, and he ran out on to the pavement. His pulse was beating
rapidly at the thrill of this unexpected adventure. He waited some
moments, but saw nothing stirring. Then he went back and shut the
door. When he had switched off the light and regained the little
passage in the flat, he found Emma seated on a hall chair, her head
buried in her hands.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Emma," he said. "How did you get in?"</p>

<p>"I had the key."</p>

<p>Of course she had the key. She had a key so that she could get
in and do her work when the Querrils were away. He turned on the
light in the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Come in and tell me," he said softly.</p>

<p>She followed him, with her head bent and her bosom heaving.</p>

<p>He sat in a chair away from her and waited for her to begin. And
then he found her eyes, which were not all grief, watching him
above her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"He was all right," she said suddenly, "until last month. And
then that man he had often spoken of, who he calls old Castro, he
turned up. I don't know who he is. Father said once that they were
shipmates. Father's been all sorts of things in his time. This man
Castro is a terror. He's a foreigner of some sort, a seafaring man.
Father seemed terrified when he first saw him, and then they went
out together and got drunk. He's an awful man..."</p>

<p>Emma shivered and bit her handkerchief. Peter noticed among
other little things that her handkerchief was clean and her clothes
tidy and in good taste. It struck him how she had improved since
the day when he first saw her, standing inert in that room at
Hammersmith. She seemed no longer "the extraordinarily interesting
kid," but a woman, with all the ingenuousness of childhood added to
the point and mystery of womanhood. The sleepy eyes were more
watchful and alluring, and "the old ghost in her ancestry" had many
things to say about the senses.</p>

<p>She found him watching her, and continued at random:</p>

<p>"Father took to drinking again, and one night Castro tried to
kiss me, and there was a lot of trouble, and Father wanted to turn
me out. 'Go and live on these swell friends of yours,' he says. You
was away at the time, Mr. Peter, and, of course, in any
case..."</p>

<p>Emma smiled feebly, with a supplicating look at the back of her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Father and old Castro seemed to know everything. He came and
told me to-night that you was back, and told me to come to you.
When I refused, he twisted my arm and went out. He came back alone
about an hour ago. He was like a madman. He drove me out, and said
if I didn't come here he'd kill me. He followed me along the
streets. I thought he was watching me outside..."</p>

<p>The truth of the position began to dawn on Peter. He stood up
and paced the room.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a rum thing, Emma," he said. "I don't know what
to do. You see, I'm here alone. I&mdash;Perhaps I'd better take you
to a hotel."</p>

<p>And then suddenly she jumped up and threw her arms round
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't let me go! Don't let me go! I'm frightened. Keep me
here with you, Mr. Peter."</p>

<p>Peter felt her warm body pressing against his, and her arms
holding him tight, and he thought of black-bearded men dancing in a
forest. His voice trembled as he whispered:</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps it would be all right for you to sleep in one of
the bedrooms. No one need know."</p>

<p>And then the most surprising moment in his life came to Peter.
Her head was on his breast, and slowly she turned her face upwards
and closed her eyes, and put out her lips for him to kiss. The kiss
had happened almost before he was aware of its danger, and it
lasted for a hundred years. When at last he held her from him, his
face was drawn and white, and he could not get his voice. And Emma
was no longer a child, but a thing of clinging essences, vibrating
to the rhythm of primitive life. And she appeared freer, more
unselfconscious than he. She exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Do you know what was happening on that night when your brother
first came to the buildings?"</p>

<p>He managed to say "No."</p>

<p>"I was walking out as he came in. I was on my way. I was going
on the streets."</p>

<p>"Emma!...Emma!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't despise me, you kid! You know nothing. You don't know
the sort of life we have to live, you people. Only you came after
that, and it all seemed different then. And I fought against this
feeling because I wanted you. I want <i>you</i>, do you see? I made
up my mind, if ever I was driven out, it was <i>you</i> should have
me."</p>

<p>It was then that the chivalrous impulses of the philosopher
found their master key. And he thought of the woman in the wood,
the sacrifice of spring! Did ever such an opportunity occur to any
knight riding through stricken lands? And he raised his hand as Sir
Lancelot must have raised his visor and thought: "I will save this
woman in the face of the whole world."</p>

<hr>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>He held her tightly and said: "You mustn't say these mad things,
Emma. You're overwrought. Come and lie down. To-morrow we'll make a
plan for you."</p>

<p>She sighed, and he led her into the unoccupied bedroom. He
transferred the key to the inside so that she could lock herself
in. He dare not trust himself to kiss her again, and as he went out
he saw her standing ghost-like and tremulous by the end of the
bed.</p>

<p>As he returned to his room, his mind was working at a furious
pace. Desires and vague resolutions were tumbling over each other,
and he could not focus them. "The other kind of love," which he had
for Emma, was desperately assertive, but it was hallowed by these
new-found impulses of knight-errantry. How splendid a thing to
marry her, after all, in face of all the world! To protect her and
care for her, to know that he had saved her from the stake. He
could see himself, a small, heroic figure, routing these bearded
men with their monotonous rhythm. And she loved him. Loved
him...the most wonderful, moving, flattering experience of all. She
was in that room now, not ten paces from him, longing for him,
holding out her arms to him, her white knight! He lay there he knew
not how long, rocking with his fevered irresolutions. Away in the
distance he could hear the dim rumble of London's dubious midnight
activities, and it sounded to him like the rise and fall of some
great orchestral overture dimly prescient of the coming drama.</p>

<p>And then he heard a cry. He sprang out of bed and ran into the
passage. It was all in darkness, but by the door was a figure all
in white. He groped his way towards it and cried out:</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>Emma was leaning against the door.</p>

<p>"I thought I heard something," she whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>The boy approached her and put his arm round her. And for the
first time in his life his hand adventured the soft curves of a
woman's body beneath her corsetless night-dress. In the dim light
reflected from the moon above St. Stephen's he could just see her
eyes, and the dark setting of her hair hanging free round her
shoulders. And his senses quickened by this unwonted exhilaration
told him that she was lying, but he did not care.</p>

<p>"Why are you here?" he panted.</p>

<p>She did not answer. She seemed to be swaying, and he clutched
her madly.</p>

<p>Oh, Peter, Peter! when the ramparts have fallen, and the castle
is overrun by these bearded men with their interminable rhythm,
what hope is there for the forces of chivalry?</p>

<p>They clung together like children afraid of the darkness, and
then he whispered hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Come into your room, then!"</p>

<p>In one vivid moment, Peter thought:</p>

<p>"Magda has slept on this bed, and Mother, and all of them at
times..."</p>

<p>But that ironic stab of contrition came too late&mdash;only just
too late.</p>

Has a Relapse</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>It was the last day of September, and the Querrils had returned
to Chessilton Heath. The month was making a loyal attempt to
retrieve its depressing start. It was late afternoon, and the sun
was warming the opulent foliage in the garden with that benign air
of assured satisfaction which he assumes only when the stress of
summer has passed. By the side of the lawn a tall mass of
sunflowers nodded placidly, as though the sun had made these little
counterfeits of himself as a wayward jest, a memento to tickle the
imagination of these mortals when his day's work was accomplished.
The bees were very busy among the hollyhocks, like late shoppers on
a market day. The creeper on the south wall of the garden had
changed from a pattern of crimson to gold within a week. Potash was
very sorry for himself. He had developed a rash, and had been
bathed in some quite unnecessary liquid which made him tingle. He
lay on the grass with his nose resting between his paws, consumed
with resentment that Perlmutter was apparently not afflicted in the
same way. Decimus had called in and was talking to Evelyn and a
young man named Gregory Guest, on the brick walk of the pergola.
Martin was cutting the lawn above the embankment, and Mr. Querril
was cleaning up the soil of the rose beds. Peter and Rodney had not
yet returned from town, and Magda was also up there with a girl
friend, furnishing and arranging her flat at Chelsea. The Lemaires
had not yet returned from the Continent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Querril regarded the scene from her bedroom window and
sighed. She was never quite happy when the circle was not complete.
A recollection came to her of when she was a little girl in her
mother's home. She had thought one day how lovely it would be if
she could take all her family, just all the people she loved most
dearly, away to some desert island where they would be all alone. A
beautiful island where it was all sunshine, and flowers and
waterfalls, with all the necessary home comforts. And there would
be no one else there at all, and they would go on living
indefinitely, growing more and more loving to each other. And then
she thought:</p>

<p>"How funny that would have been if we really had gone! I should
never have met George. And now there are others. Quite a large
party for the island. And then there will be&mdash;let me see, when
will it be? About next April or May&mdash;another still, perhaps.
Magda's. I wonder whether it will be a boy or a girl...I wish
Evelyn wouldn't wear those brown stockings with that
biscuit-colored skirt. They make her ankles look so thick. And my
Martin, he will marry soon, and then Rodney, and Evelyn, and
Peter."</p>

<p>Mrs. Querril had a momentary vision of a Utopian world peopled
by Querrils, and all these dear friends of theirs. It was a world
in which photographs played a not unimportant part. And the day
would come when she, alas! would pass beyond it, but it was
pleasant to think of Magda or Evelyn holding up a little fat pink
Querril, and pointing to an enlarged photograph on the wall, and
saying:</p>

<p>"Look, darling, that was your dear grandmama!"</p>

<p>It was a little source of disappointment to Mrs. Querril that
neither of the boys fell in love with the Lemaire girls. There were
times when she thought that Rodney and Annette, and then Peter and
Annette, and then Rodney and Joan, and then Martin and Joan...but
no, it never seemed to get beyond the brother and sister stage. The
only likely case was Peter and Annette. They were undoubtedly very
fond of each other, these two. They rambled about together and went
on picnics, and when Peter was ten he had proposed and been
accepted. And once when they were children they got lost together
up on Polly's Head beyond the heath. It was a warm summer night,
and they never came home. Some one found them the next morning,
sleeping quite peacefully in each other's arms among the bracken.
And even now Peter and Annette meant a lot to each other. But it
was so difficult to tell. Young people nowadays were so different
from what they were when Mrs. Querril was a girl. They said such
surprising things to each other, and even kissed, but it very often
meant nothing. They would lie about all mixed up. There was
something about it very charming. So trustful and beautiful. In
fact, it was only possible among really pure and beautiful
natures.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Mrs. Querril's reveries were disturbed by a sudden commotion in
the garden. Evelyn was screaming, and Martin was running after her.
Ptolemy the Second had caught a bird! Ptolemy the Second, who in
all his career had never been known to hunt either birds or mice,
to work, love or hate, was suddenly transformed into a fiend
incarnate. He had run across the grass, flat-footed, with his tail
whipping the ground, and a thrush between his cruel teeth. He was
hiding now among the cabbages. The relief expedition was in hot
pursuit. Evelyn, quite pale, was screaming:</p>

<p>"Put it down! Ptolemy! Put it down!"</p>

<p>And Martin, following, tense and determined, with Mr. Querril
bringing up the rear with a hoe and crying out:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear! This won't do!"</p>

<p>Decimus and Mr. Guest remained on the brick path. They were
discussing the best hotel in Bayreuth, and Guest glanced at the
vegetable garden, and said casually:</p>

<p>"The cat's caught a bird. Well, we stayed at the Kaiserhof the
summer before last and..."</p>

<p>But the awful tragedy was proceeding. Martin dashed among the
cabbages, but Ptolemy shot like a black streak from one to another,
and disappeared. Then Evelyn saw him under some huge rhubarb
leaves. His eyes flashed bright green and he was growling. He
looked horrible. Evelyn would never have believed that dear Ptolemy
could look like that. That passion could be so disfiguring. He was
a different creature. She felt frightened. Martin again attacked,
but Ptolemy was much too quick for him. Then Mr. Querril tried
coaxing methods, which were quite unsuccessful. The dogs joined in
the din. They barked, but having taken one look at Ptolemy they
raced back to the lawn and continued barking there. And Ptolemy was
becoming angry. He was like a wild thing. He resented all this
ridiculous interference. He wanted to enjoy himself, to be cruel at
leisure...The hunt was quite abortive. Ptolemy was last seen under
the rhododendron bushes in the Lemaires' garden, and then he
vanished entirely.</p>

<p>Martin took Evelyn's arm. She was shaking, and the tears were
glistening in her eyes.</p>

<p>"The bird must be quite dead," Martin said consolingly, and Mr.
Querril echoed:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, the bird must have been quite dead...a long time."</p>

<p>The disconsolate party trailed back to the house.</p>

<p>"But I can't make it out," Evelyn suddenly burst out. "It's so
horrible. Ptolemy has never done this before. Why, oh, why should
he suddenly...He looked so horrid."</p>

<p>They were within earshot of the two gentlemen discussing hotels
under the pergola, and Guest turned and smiled.</p>

<p>"My dear girl," he said. "Cats will be cats. It's
natural..."</p>

<p>He was never invited to the Querrils' again.</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The incident of Ptolemy cast a gloom over the rest of the
evening, and apparently Rodney and Peter had missed their train.
They usually caught the 5.27, which got them down at half-past six
in comfortable time for dinner. It meant now that they wouldn't be
down till 8.15, and they had not telephoned. Members of the family
usually telephoned their movements from town if they were not
catching usual trains. There was always a slightly strained feeling
when any of them were away. Mrs. Querril would never leave the
house. If some one suggested a walk, she would have a blouse of
Evelyn's to finish, or a letter that must be written to dear Uncle
Arthur in Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>The grass was becoming wet with heavy dew, and they went inside
and lighted up. Mr. Quest had been speeded on his journey, but
Decimus came in and sat in the drawing-room. Martin went upstairs
to work.</p>

<p>Mrs. Querril drew up her chair under the standard lamp. She was
very busy making things for Magda. There were a lot of things
darling Magda would be wanting now. She was very lucky to be able
to do the little things for her children. They would have dinner
late tonight&mdash;about eight. That would mean that the boys would
come in soon after they had started. At the same time it would be a
slight concession to George&mdash;not to wait till
8.15&mdash;because he always liked to dine at 7.30. George should
have a glass of cherry brandy and a biscuit at seven. That would
keep him going.</p>

<p>Decimus was talking to George as usual. What a funny man he was!
But he always talked so much, and in such a peculiar topsy-turvy
way. She found that it made her tired to listen to him for long. He
was saying:</p>

<p>"...than that mountebank Euclid! My dear sir, Euclid never
evolved one original premise. Give him one of those silly little
triangles or circles, and he will spend hours proving a thing which
any man with a sense of form can see at a glance. I don't want a
man to spend half the morning telling me that any two sides of a
triangle are together greater than the third side. I also object to
his method of proving that some quite obvious and useless
proposition is wrong and then exclaiming: 'Which is absurd! y This
of course is simply rude. It's like putting your tongue out at a
student and calling him a fool. If a thing is absurd, why launch
into all this talk about it? Why not leave it alone, or else prove
that something which appears absurd is really rather sensible?"</p>

<p>A most amusing man!</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Just before dinner the telephone bell went. Evelyn dashed to it.
It was Rodney. The telephone seemed to be working badly. He was
very indistinct. She gathered that they had both been delayed and
would not be down till the last train, which arrived at 11.20. He
wanted to speak to Martin.</p>

<p>Martin went to the telephone. They heard him say:</p>

<p>"Yes...yes. All right, old man."</p>

<p>Then he hung up the receiver, and went up to his bedroom.</p>

<p>At dinner they were all very quiet, with the exception of Mr.
Querril, who was in one of his Gladstonian moods, which was not a
good sign. Evelyn knew that when her father talked about Mr.
Gladstone&mdash;of whom he had a great admiration&mdash;he was
always worrying about something. And she could see no connection
between the tragic moral relapse of Ptolemy and the Coercion Act in
Ireland in 1881.</p>

<p>"Do you remember, Decimus," he was saying, "how he held out for
the three F's? Fair rent, fixity of tenure, and free sale?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Querril looked at her husband admiringly, and said to
Evelyn:</p>

<p>"Evelyn darling, get your father some of that 'gentleman's
relish'!"</p>

<p>"I do hope he won't sit up for the boys," she thought. "He
always will. It's so unnecessary, and they are sure to be all
right."</p>

<p>She was always trying to persuade Mr. Querril to retire from
business. She disliked London-a dreadful, dangerous place and worse
than ever now with all these motor-buses and taxi-cabs. One was
always reading of such dreadful things in the papers. One day they
would all live down there together. As the children married they
would each take a house on the Heath. And then they would be always
visiting each other, bringing over each other's babies to play, and
exchanging photographs. Chessilton Heath was almost as good as the
island. It was free from the element of alarm and distress. There
was plenty of time to cross the roadway. The only danger was from
golf balls, and that was only in certain parts of the heath, and
then people always called out, "Fore!" so kindly. The villagers and
tradesmen were so kind and nice. Every one was kind and good. One
only had to believe that people were good, and it brought the good
out in them. She always secretly disapproved of "that Settlement."
Of course it was right that the boys should be kind and charitable,
but she didn't like the idea of them actually going and mixing with
"all those people." They might just as well have stopped at home
and sent a donation. Poverty and suffering distressed her so that
she could not contemplate it. She tried to believe that it did not
exist, or that, if it did exist, it was rapidly righting itself
somehow. Any book or play which dealt with such things, she would
not read or see. She would say:</p>

<p>"There is quite enough of that sort of thing in the world, my
dear, without reading about it."</p>

<p>Mr. Querril still continued talking about Gladstone, and Martin
with his eyes on his plate, thought:</p>

<p>"Oh, God, I wish he'd stop!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Querril suddenly observed that Martin was looking very
pale. She thought:</p>

<p>"I must get Martin some of that stuff that Jeanne Lemaire was
recommending. My dear Martin works too hard."</p>

<p>Her mind quickly reverted to Magda, as it always did when it
required relief. Thoughts concerning Magda now were the coziest
thoughts in the little boudoir of her mind.</p>

<p>"Somewhere about the beginning of May. Dear me, it's Papa's
birthday on the third of May, and Peter's on the seventeenth. I
hope the affairs won't clash. What on earth has cook done with
these French beans to-night? They're quite brown..."</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>It was Mr. Querril who suggested that they should sit in Peter's
studio after dinner. And thither they all went with the exception
of Martin, who remained in the drawing-room to read a novel. But
Martin didn't read. He held the novel in front of his eyes and
occasionally read a sentence. But across every page there danced
before his eyes the words that Rodney had whispered over the
telephone:</p>

<p>"Keep calm, old man. Something awful has happened. I can't tell
you. Meet me on the 11.15. Say nothing to the others."</p>

<p>Good God? What did it mean? He said nothing about Peter. Peter
had been killed? He felt that Peter had been killed. He sat there
shaking, and fingering the leaves of "The Dark Flower" by John
Galsworthy.</p>

<p>Upstairs Evelyn turned on the gramophone, and they listened to
two songs by Caruso. On an easel by the wall was an unfinished
landscape that Peter was going to send to the International
Exhibition. It was a low-toned study of a brown field and a few
bare trees against a lowering sky. And Peter said he was going to
call it "Spring." That was so like Peter! So unlike the normal
conception of spring. No fresh green leaves and dancing lambs, but
very like spring in some of her moods, bleak and gray, with a
suggestion of something behind, something virile being born behind
the dark harrows. Mr. Querril smiled sympathetically. Peter's
technic was somewhat crude, but the root of the matter was there
all right. His canvases were alive with ideas, at present'
inadequately expressed. What a strange thing it would be if Peter
became a great painter! Why not? Not one of the Querrils had ever
attained eminence, but they all had ability.</p>

<p>"It is the kind of stock from which genius will sometimes
spring," thought Mr. Querril.</p>

<p>Caruso was doing his best to pour some of the oleaginous vintage
of the warm South into this Northern crucible, but for once he
failed to arouse enthusiasm.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock Decimus took his departure, and Mr. and Mrs.
Querril had a short game of picquet, which Mrs. Querril won and
then went to bed. Evelyn followed her.</p>

<p>Martin somehow felt he could not be left alone with his father.
He said he would go for a stroll round and then go and meet
Rodney.</p>

<p>"You won't sit up, will you, guv'nor?" he said, knowing
perfectly well Mr. Querril's reply:</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh, yes, of course I shall sit up!"</p>

<p>He saw him stuffing tobacco into his pipe, and settling down to
read. He looked so calm&mdash;so utterly unconscious of the
"something awful" now rushing towards him in a train from London.
Martin choked back a sob of pity, and hurried from the room.</p>

<p>The night had turned cold and dark. He walked briskly across the
heath, making a long circular trip. White sign-posts stood up out
of the darkness, and he could hear the tinkle of sheep-bells behind
an enclosure. Lights were faintly perceptible in the upper rooms of
several houses, but many of them were already in darkness. He
reached the station half an hour too soon, and plunged hither and
thither. Once he raced back as he saw the lights of a train
approaching, but it was only a goods train that went lumbering
through. Then he waited beneath a dark wall by the corn chandler's
shop.</p>

<p>At last he heard the distant shriek of a whistle, and the 11.15
came languidly along the metals. He stood just outside the gate,
with his hat pulled down over his eyes. The train stopped, the
engine panting and gasping, like an old lady winded by a nocturnal
adventure.</p>

<p>A few people trickled through the booking office. At the end
came a man, reeling as though he were drunk. His collar was turned
up and his hat was pulled right down over his eyes. It was Rodney.
Martin stretched out his hand and gripped him, and as though by
mutual consent they said nothing, but hurried on together down the
lane. Rodney's face was perfectly white, and his lips quivered.
Every moment he gave a little involuntary groan, like a man
recovering from the effect of drugs. They reached the field and
leaned against the stile&mdash;the very stile where Mr. Querril had
worried so about young Stallard&mdash;a cart went crunching down
the lane hard by, and then all was silent. And Rodney buried his
face in his hands and groaned.</p>

<p>Martin gripped his brother's shoulders, and whispered:</p>

<p>"What is it, old man? Is he&mdash;?" The word "dead" faded on
his lips.</p>

<p>Rodney choked back the tears, and looked up. His eyes were
buried in dark rings.</p>

<p>"O God! O God!" he gasped. "I wish he were. I wish he were dead.
It's worse than that!"</p>

<p>Martin said nothing, but his breath came quickly.</p>

<p>"They've taken him. They've arrested Peter. They've taken our
Peter,"</p>

<p>Rodney was crying now and he didn't care. He had wanted to cry
all day.</p>

<p>"It's those Troons. They say she's tinder sixteen. They've
arrested him on a charge of criminal assault on a young girl."</p>

<p>Martin could do nothing but convulsively clutch his brother's
arms and shoulders. No words would come. He had not yet the relief
of tears.</p>

<p>"I've had an awful day. There's nothing to be done. If they find
him guilty, he'll go to prison&mdash;perhaps for years. Our Peter
will go to prison. What are we going to do, Martin? We've got to
tell them! We've got to tell them! And Magda doesn't know. I had no
time to go to Chelsea. I've been with lawyers all day. She'll see
it in the newspapers in the morning!"</p>

<p>"Is it all true, Rodney? Did he&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"He spent a night with her in the flat. He's confessed it. But I
can't believe she's under sixteen. The man Troon has produced a
birth certificate. Is father up?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He's waiting. You're unstrung, old chap. Let me go ahead
and&mdash;tell him."</p>

<p>Martin was already more concerned about Rodney than about any
one. He added:</p>

<p>"Perhaps we won't tell the Mater or Evelyn to-night. After we've
told the guv'nor, I'll slip out, and cycle up to London. There are
no more trains. I can do it in a few hours. I'll go straight to
Magda."</p>

<p>Rodney did not answer. They had come to the gravel path of the
carriage drive. A dim light showed in the hall. He stumbled up to
the door, and Martin helped him to the porch seat outside. Then he
whispered:</p>

<p>"Wait here!"</p>

<p>Martin went straight in. His face had that set look of
determination which characterized it when he went in among the
cabbages after Ptolemy the Second. He walked quietly but
deliberately into the drawing-room, and shut the door. Mr. Querril
looked up from his book. Before he had time to speak, Martin said
as casually as he could:</p>

<p>"I say, Pater, Rodney has just come in. He's rather done up.
There's been a bit of a dust up. Peter, it seems, has got into some
sort of silly mess. Of course it's nothing. It'll probably blow
over in a day or two. There is a girl mixed up in it or
something."</p>

<p>Mr. Querril took off his spectacles and looked mildly alarmed.
He didn't understand at all what it was all about. He coughed and
said:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! isn't he coming down to-night then?"</p>

<p>"No. It seems he had to call at a police station or something or
other. He probably won't be down for a day or two. We thought we
wouldn't tell the Mater or Evelyn about it tonight."</p>

<p>Mr. Querril immediately had a definite position to cling to.
There was trouble of some sort, and, "Of course, assuredly no! We
wouldn't tell the Mater about it." A great mistake to worry those
you love with unnecessary misgivings.</p>

<p>"Of course, quite right! Quite right! Martin," he said,
enthusiastically, "no need to tell them. I'm sorry. Where is
Rodney? Has he gone to bed?"</p>

<p>"Yes. At least I think he's on his way up. He's got a bad
head."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Mr. Querril looked into the fire and rubbed his glasses
vigorously. There were a thousand questions he wanted to ask,
but-Poor Rodney! How very distressing! Martin too looked very
dejected. Perhaps it would be better not to worry them both. Within
his breast there was a brief conflict of the sensibilities, and the
broader aspect of the case triumphed. It was apparent that both
Rodney and Martin were very distressed and upset, and were not
anxious to be more communicative to-night. His position as a
father&mdash;Alone in his bed he would endure the white night of
suspense.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter 10&mdash;Film-Land</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Antonio Castro was an Irishman. At least that was the
nationality he frequently claimed. On the other hand, he had
sometimes been heard to remark that "one nationality was as good as
another to hang a man by," and also that "he'd swop his nationality
with a Chink if it would bring him the price of a pot of beer." He
was of quite indeterminate age, with curly hair that seemed to have
turned prematurely white. His yellow, pock-marked face and keen,
malevolent eyes certainly seemed younger than the hair, and the
little silver earrings and the tattoo marks extending to the back
of either hand added to the general picturesqueness of this human
ruffian. Antonio spoke a sailors' language. That is to say, if you
put him down in any port in either hemisphere he would, by a
cunning combination of pantomime and polyglot expression, obtain
anything needful for the ministration of his material demands. He
knew neither fear nor master. He was always willing to eat, drink,
fight, or play cards for any stakes with any man.</p>

<p>In the witness box at the Old Bailey he gave his evidence with
an easy and insolent assurance, his dark eyes flashing, and the
steady grin revealing the line of firm white teeth. Assuredly he
had known his friend Jim Troon since the fall in 1888. They had
been shipmates together in the <i>Norman Baron</i>, plying between
the islands of the Malay Archipelago, and again on the oil tank
steamer <i>Don Alfonzo</i> between 'Frisco and Yokohama. He had
known the first Mrs. Troon well. Her maiden name was Maria Ferrati.
He couldn't say whether she was Italian. She looked it, but he
never heard her speak any other lingo than good British. He
identified Emma as her daughter. He had occasion to remember her
birth, because it happened in the month of November, 1901, and
during that winter he was working at the Commercial Road docks and
often visited the Troons. He examined the birth certificate with
great interest, and nodded his acceptance of the fact that it was a
true and proper document. The certificate showed that the birth of
Emma Troon had been duly registered at the registrar's office in
St. Bride's parish, Stockwell, in July, 1896, thus proving that she
was within two months of her sixteenth year at the time of the
assault. It was signed by a registrar, an aged man who was also
called to give evidence. He identified the signature and found that
it was corroborated by the books of the registry. He had no
recollection of "the parties concerned." People were coming in all
day to register babies.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The case was over by three o'clock in the afternoon, and Jim
Troon and his friend Castro went out of the court together, and
made a beeline for the nearest public bar, which happened to be not
three minutes' walk away. Jim called for "two three's of gin," and
the two men began to recover from the strain of their uncomfortable
appearance in a court of law. Jim nodded and winked and
muttered:</p>

<p>"Well, we done down the stinking lime-juicers."</p>

<p>The most difficult element in human life which the reformer has
to cope with is the element of perversity. There was no real reason
why Jim Troon should so detest the Querrils. They had come to him
with open arms, anxious to help, to be friendly, and extremely
anxious not to appear patronizing. But there is a primordial streak
in most of us, and in men of the type of Jim Troon most
particularly, of hatred towards anything which is superior to
ourselves. And Jim Troon's hatred was of a particularly ugly kind.
His friend Castro raised his glass and remarked:</p>

<p>"Chin Chin! Let the blasted guy rot in chokee! Now what about
the gel?"</p>

<p>Jim wiped his mouth and his eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"You 'eard what the lawyer bloke said. Fifty quid down, and two
pounds a week till the &mdash;&mdash; comes out of quod. Then 'e's
to be consulted."</p>

<p>"Yup," replied Castro, "and now what about my little bit?"</p>

<p>"It's a square do," said Jim. "You don't cop me goin' back on me
word. It's 'alves all through."</p>

<p>"Good boy!" said Castro, "but the mutton-faced galoot said he
was only goin' to pay the money to the gel. She's to fetch it every
week."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry! That gel's under age."</p>

<p>And Jim's laugh was not a pleasant thing to hear.</p>

<p>"'E give 'er fifty pound in notes on the spot And I'm looking
for Emma. She cut off directly she had left the stand."</p>

<p>"Your friend Castro will accompany you," grinned the
"Irishman."</p>

<p>They had two more of these refreshing drinks, and then boarded a
bus to Hammersmith.</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>After giving her evidence at the trial, Emma went straight home,
without waiting to hear the verdict and sentence. The atmosphere of
the court frightened her. She didn't understand what it was all
about. A gentleman had given her fifty pounds and had promised her
two pounds a week for an indefinite period, and this news absorbed
her whole interest. It opened up a new vista of life. As far as
Peter was concerned, she was sorry but not unreasonably distressed.
He was to all intents and purposes finished. Her father had told
her that "the young swell" would get two years' hard, and for any
one like that, "brought up soft," it would finish them. She
shivered when she thought of the delirious moments she had enjoyed
with him and that it would never happen again. But still...From the
top of the Hammersmith bus her dark eyes were watching the people.
There were plenty of them. They were going in and out of shops,
going in and out of restaurants, eating, drinking, laughing, buying
clothes, buying jewels and motor cars. Oh, yes, there were plenty
of people and things going on...a girl must look after herself.
Fifty pounds! She could buy a house surely, and go and live in it
with servants, and go out to restaurants to dinner. What couldn't
one buy with fifty pounds? And then a steady income every week
without any work to do! A glow of comfortable excitement crept into
the eyes of the watcher on the bus.</p>

<p>She found their rooms at the tenement deserted. The stepmother
had put on her best bonnet and gone to the trial. So thrilling and
entertaining a <i>cause clebre</i> did not occur every day of her
life. Emma washed her face and made herself some tea, then she lay
on the bed and dreamed. Crowds of little visions danced before her
eyes, a foretaste of the splendid experiences to come. She had
already peeped behind the curtain, and the scene intoxicated her.
She had no idea how long she lay there, before she heard the sound
of men's voices singing on the stairs. It was her father and
Castro. They came in in their most hilarious mood, with their hats
on the backs of their heads, and struck ridiculous attitudes. When
her father had sated himself with song he said to Emma:</p>

<p>"So she's lost 'er darlin' boy!"</p>

<p>And Castro broke into some rollicking sea song. Emma watched
them both alertly, without speaking. At last her father added:</p>

<p>"She's lost the boy and got a bit of bunce." And Castro went
down on his knees to her, and spoke some drunken foreign language
as though he were paying court.</p>

<p>"Let's 'ave a look at the little bits o' paper," said Jim at
last.</p>

<p>She had dreaded this, and she said sullenly:</p>

<p>"It's my money."</p>

<p>Then Jim was righteously indignant. Did she take him for a thief
and scoundrel? Of course it was her money. The young swine had done
her down, made a wanton of her, and it was only right the family
should pay for it. But she wasn't a financier, was she? She
couldn't handle notes and bank balances. No, her good father would
collect it, pay it into a bank and look after it for her. When she
wanted a bit, he would hand it over. She should live in luxury and
comfort all her days. It was only right. His daughter was a lady.
And Emma watched him with her lazy eyes and suddenly flashed:</p>

<p>"Was that why you drove me to it?"</p>

<p>Then there was very nearly trouble of a physical kind, and
Castro had to intervene with his oily voice and his flashing,
dangerous eyes. Eventually Jim got hold of the notes and stuffed
them in his pocket The following morning, to her surprise, he
turned up at eleven o'clock with Castro and handed her a sovereign.
The rest he said he had "put in the bank for her." Then he and
Castro went out, and were not seen again for ten days. They drifted
through Hammersmith, Chelsea, Greenwich, Blackwall, Poplar,
Limehouse, and God knows where, eating, drinking, quarreling,
playing quoits, faro, and poker, attending dog fights and music
halls, and converting Mr. Querril's money into the means of
satisfying every mortal lust. Emma waited four days for her father
to return, then one morning, when there was a warmth in the air,
she rose up and dressed herself in her best, and did up a neat
little parcel of her belongings. When her stepmother asked her
where she was going, she told her to "mind her own bloody
business," and she went out and never returned again to Casement
buildings.</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>She took a room in Bloomsbury, and called on the lawyer who had
handed her the money. He was a kind, oldish man, whose office was
in Lincolns Inn Fields. He said she could have the two pounds every
Friday, if she called any time before five o'clock.</p>

<p>Emma found her room very comfortable. She got up late, had all
she wanted to eat, sat about the place and made friends with her
fellow lodgers, went to cinemas. Life was full and satisfying. She
could never get over the emotional thrill of the moving pictures.
It was wonderful to step off the pavement on a dull day, and
suddenly find oneself whirled into an atmosphere of blazing
sunshine in some Italian garden (in New York), where gorgeously
beautiful women were badly treated by their fabulously rich
husbands. And then to the strains of intoxicating music the drama
moved amidst adventures of stolen babies, and diamonds, and
government secrets, and the young heroic clergyman who saved the
gorgeously beautiful wife in the end. Every one seemed so rich, and
so well dressed, and so good looking, and the music was so
suggestive of the good things of life.</p>

<p>Emma would return to her room limp and wide-eyed. It occurred to
her after a time that she was not rich enough. That two pounds a
week wasn't so very much after all. She called on the lawyer again,
and put her case to him. The cost of living in Bloomsbury was
excessive, and she had incurred expenses and so on. He said he
would report her complaints to Mr. Querril. In due course she was
informed that her allowance was to be increased to three pounds a
week.</p>

<p>On the strength of this accretion of wealth, she moved to a
larger room in the same house, stayed longer in bed, ate more, and
went to more cinemas. At that time she made friends with a Mrs.
Womblesby, a florid, middle-aged lady on the first floor, who had a
pink, puffy face beneath its powder, masses of short, fuzzy hair,
and little blue earrings. She flattered Emma enormously, and was
always talking about her beauty.</p>

<p>"You are a pretty thing," she would say, and then she would nod
her head and make funny little clicking noises with her tongue. She
drank great quantities of stout, and was always trying to persuade
Emma to do the same.</p>

<p>"If you had more blood, my dear, you'd be able to run with the
best of them," was another favorite remark. She met some most
peculiar men in Mrs. Womblesby's room, and one night Mrs. Womblesby
left her alone with a gray-haired gentleman with long legs and
boney fingers. He suddenly caught hold of her and kissed her on the
lips. She had a terrible struggle to escape from him and threatened
to scream the house down.</p>

<p>When she complained to Mrs. Womblesby afterwards, that good lady
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Reely! Well, I never thought the Major would behave like that,"
and then she added with a sly little wink:</p>

<p>"E'd 'ave given you a sovereign, I expect, my dear."</p>

<p>And Emma felt no horror at this suggestion. She gazed out of the
window at the passers-by and answered sullenly:</p>

<p>"I don't need his sovereigns, thank you."</p>

<p>At last a young man, and Austrian waiter, named Busche, made
violent love to her. There was something about him rather
fascinating. She had seen his like in the gorgeous rooms of the New
York moving pictures. He was redolent of pomade and high life. She
gave herself to him, and went to live with him in some rooms in
Greek Street, Soho. But the affair lasted only five weeks. She
found that he had a violent temper, and he disgusted her in many
ways. Moreover, he seemed inclined to throw up his work and to live
on her money. They quarreled and fought like two animals, and she
left him and went back to Mrs. Womblesby.</p>

<p>But she had acquired a more expensive taste in living. She liked
to go out to restaurants, and began to find music halls more
thrilling than cinemas. She bought clothes and paste jewelry and
got into debt. She again appealed to the Querrils, and to her
surprise received a visit from Rodney.</p>

<p>Rodney was kind and polite, but very firm.</p>

<p>"I hope you're not unhappy, Emma," he said. "I don't know what
my brother's feelings are in the matter. Perhaps when he is free he
may do more for you, but we do not feel justified in making any
further advance. However, my father sends you this five pounds to
pay any little debts you may have. Don't you think it would be a
good idea if you took on some work of some sort?"</p>

<p>She said, "Yes," rather unconvincingly.</p>

<p>"My other brother and I have left the Treves Settlement, but if
you will call on the lady superintendent there, she has promised to
do whatever she can for you. Will you?"</p>

<p>Emma again said, "Yes," her mind busily occupied with other
matters.</p>

<p>She had no intention of going to the Treves Settlement, but she
was too frightened of "these clever people" to acknowledge it.</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>It was on the following Sunday that Emma got her chance. Mrs.
Womblesby asked her to accompany her to the Milano Caf near
Leicester Square. She said she wanted to introduce her to a
gentleman who was enormously rich. Emma put on her most alluring
clothes and went. The gentleman's name was Mr. Carl Grete. He was a
middle-aged man, very broad and strong looking. He had a red face
and a black mustache and a not unkind expression in his brown eyes.
He fixed them on Emma and did not remove them once during the
conversation. In the end he asked her to come to his flat in St
James' the next evening, to dinner with Mrs. Womblesby. Emma went,
and Mrs. Womblesby failed to put in an appearance. They dined
alone, and it was the most entrancing experience of her life. She
had never seen a place like that in real life, only on the film.
And it had the added glory of color and comfort and discreet
lighting. There were tapestries on the wall, and old furniture, and
glittering silver, and an elderly woman who served incredibly
beautiful food on pretty plates, and poured out a sparkling drink
which seemed to inspire her to an even greater appreciation of the
glories of the hour.</p>

<p>And afterwards he sat with her on the settee by the fire, and he
kissed her lips and played with her hair. And later he said
suddenly:</p>

<p>"Now look here, Emma, I'm a plain business man, and I believe in
a plain business deal. I live in Manchester, and I only come to
London sometimes. You shall have this flat to live in as your own,
you shall have a servant to wait on you, and I'll give you two
hundred a year for yourself, if you'll be my mistress and promise
to run straight when I'm away. What do you say?"</p>

<p>And Emma answered, "Yes," in the same breathless voice she had
replied to Rodney's question, only on this occasion she meant
it.</p>

<p>Mr. Carl Grete was a cotton spinner. He was married and had five
charming children living in a large house in the suburbs of
Manchester. He was a devoted husband and father, and was known in
business as a man of his word. He said:</p>

<p>"Good! Then that's a fair do! You won't find me go back on
anything I say. And I'll expect you to stick to your side of the
deal. Come to me to-morrow. I'm tired to-night. I've had a heavy
day in the city."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter 11&mdash;Mr. Querril Asks
For Cheese</h2>

<hr>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>On the day following Peter's trial and conviction Decimus
Postern took up his position lugubriously and alone in the
Querrils' drawing-room. The family had spent the previous night in
town. Decimus had arrived early and taken advantage of his position
as a <i>persona grata</i> among the servants ( established by
liberal tips at Christmas time) to make himself at home till they
returned.</p>

<p>He sat for a long time, with his fat hands resting helplessly on
his knees, staring into the deserted garden. Autumn flowers were
still blooming, and the tennis posts had not yet been taken in. The
dogs were nowhere to be seen, but Ptolemy the Second was sleeping
innocently in his position on the parapet of the pergola.</p>

<p>Occasionally Decimus would get up and walk heavily about the
room and the hall, with his hands behind his back. Once he made an
ambling survey of the house. The first thing which struck him was
an enlarged photograph of Peter in the hall. It was taken when he
was five. He was a beautiful boy, with podgy cheeks and dark eyes
that might have been on the verge of either laughter or tears. He
was wearing a velvet frock trimmed with lace, and he was standing
on a chair.</p>

<p>Decimus turned away from it. On the staircase were three
photographs of Peter; one taken last year working at an easel, one
perhaps three years ago in tennis flannels, and another in a group
with his mother and Aunt Lena. On the first landing were two more
groups in which Peter was conspicuous. He peeped into Mr. and Mrs.
Querril's bedroom (the door was wide open). Facing the bed was an
enlargement of Peter in a sailor's suit.</p>

<p>"Instruments of torture" was the phrase that occurred to
Decimus, and he tiptoed guiltily upstairs and entered Peter's
bedroom. Here were only two photographs&mdash;one of Mr. and Mrs.
Querril, and one of Magda and the dogs. On the walls were several
canvases unframed, just stuck on nails. There was Peter's tennis
racket in a press against the wall, a row of shoes, a plaster cast
on the top of the deal wardrobe. It was all very plain and simple,
but what struck Decimus was that there was something consciously
untidy about it, as though some one had dusted the room but had
made a point of leaving everything just as Peter had thrown it
down. There was a pair of gray flannel trousers flung across the
bed, a sketch just begun on the mantelpiece, an open box of
charcoal, a pile of watercolors, a cricket bat, two golf-clubs, two
old hats on a chair, pipes littering the dressing table, and a
canvas over-all hanging limply from an oak easel in the corner.</p>

<p>When Decimus surveyed this room he was conscious of an
unpleasant, choking sensation somewhere in his vast breathing
apparatus. He turned and walked slowly down the stairs of the
deserted house.</p>

<p>When he had regained the drawing-room he sank into the easy
chair facing the window.</p>

<p>"What will they do?" he thought, and then, "Instruments of
torture!"</p>

<p>He would have liked to have had Tony MacDowell there, but the
American boy had gone from Holland to Italy, and had probably heard
nothing of the trouble. He wanted to say to Tony:</p>

<p>"You would be surprised, Tony. I don't know how it is, but
they're wonderful. You were wrong about your funeral idea. As a
matter of fact, people like the Querrils are more capable of coping
with a funeral than with a wedding. Some big trouble brings out all
their best qualities. It's in the little things that they go to
pieces. But when all is said and done, there's a lot in
Querrilism."</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>He liked that word "Querrilism." There began to stir in his
brain the various chaotic imaginings which he recognized as the
symptoms of a new book. It would make an excellent book&mdash;one
of those neat little octavo volumes in what he called "The Wedgwood
Series," printed on vellum, with an oval plaque by Angelica
Kauffmann on the cover. Of course he could never write such a book.
It would be disloyal&mdash;in the worst of taste. But all the
elements were there. And curiously enough it would be a book not so
much on his views on Querrilism, but on his views of Tony's views
on Querrilism.</p>

<p>"Querrilism through Western eyes."</p>

<p>No. Too much like Joseph Conrad. Perhaps in pamphlet form,
"Querrilism. Its cause and cure." Or, "The perils of the Querrils."
No, all too flippant.</p>

<p>Decimus had a lot of time on his hands. Torrents of words,
emotions, deductions, and apothegms jumbled together in his
brain.</p>

<p>"The basic evil of Querrilism is that it is an attempt to divert
the natural channels of individual expression. A force, without
prejudice or predilection, believing only in good, ignoring the
element of conflict in human affairs, is bound eventually to
destroy or pervert itself."</p>

<p>That would be an excellent beginning. (Inspired by Tony. Tony
would be a useful man in the offices on Adelphi Terrace.) What was
it he said about "eating each other up"? But they had surprised
him. Their solicitude for each other in the crash of doom had
buoyed them up. They suffered in silence and alone. They were
"gentlemen." Mr. Querril, with all his limitations, was a unique
gentleman. You might kill a Querril, but could not divert the flow
of Querrilism. The point required expounding:</p>

<p>"It may be said of Querrilism that in any case it has great
powers of resilience. It is the herd-instinct carried to a
phenomenal degree. Entomologists tell us that the ant individually
is a perfect fool. He hasn't any idea what he's doing. He will
climb a steep boulder carrying an enormous load when he might just
as easily walk around it. He will do utterly senseless and
unnecessary things repeatedly. If you tread on his nest, he loses
his head, and behaves like a thing distraught. The herd-instinct
for the time being evaporates. It depends upon some quite
unaccountable wave of instinct for the fevered activities of
reconstruction to begin. This cannot be said of Querrilism. It is a
conscious herd-instinct. It knows what it is doing. It does not
lose its head. If you tread on its nest it begins its fevered
reconstruction instantly. If the Querril ant is crushed, the other
ants are so concerned about the feelings of each other they have no
time to suffer about their own. They close up their ranks
spiritually. They become more intensely a herd."</p>

<p>And then suddenly something seemed to snap in Decimus. The tears
started to his eyes, and his great body shook.</p>

<p>"O God!" he groaned. "What will they do? What will they do?"</p>

<p>He buried his face in his hands and was very silent. No more
words came to illumine the dark spaces of his emotion. The day
began to draw in. He rose at last, and stood by the window. The
tennis lawn looked neat and trim. A few late roses were spilling
their abundance in little pools of red and white. A mass of yellow
flowers stood out boldly against the Lemaires' fence. It all looked
very sane and placid, supremely conscious of the genial hours of
its past and of the "ghosts of lovers," supremely innocent of the
wild, unreasoning disaster hovering above its fading
loveliness.</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>And then through the little gate at the end of the garden there
came a figure in a gray cloak. It was Annette. She came dilatorily
along the grass paths, looking stonily at the tennis court and the
flowers. And Decimus knew that her mind was occupied with thoughts
very similar to his. She seemed to be looking at each flower and
saying:</p>

<p>"What will they do? O God! what will they do?"</p>

<p>She walked so slowly it appeared to be difficult to drag one leg
after another. Once she swayed, and he thought she was going to
fall. He went to the window and called gently:</p>

<p>"Annette!"</p>

<p>The face of a friend seemed to steady her. She nodded at him
sagely and increased her pace a little. He saw her amble up the
path and disappear into the house. After a moment or two she
entered the room, and he went forward to meet her. The pupils of
her eyes were distended and her cheeks were damp. She crept towards
him aimlessly, and he kissed her on the cheek. She gave a faint
little sigh and muttered:</p>

<p>"Dessy dear."</p>

<p>But all the life had gone out of her voice. She drifted by him
to the window and looked up at the sky. Her lips were parted, and
her hands were crossed on her breast. Decimus could see that her
whole body was shaking, and yet the tears would not come.</p>

<p>Suddenly she said in a dry voice:</p>

<p>"Soon the willow herb will be out, and he won't be here..."</p>

<p>She continued to nod her head in a wise fashion, as though she
were communing with the God who had the ordering of herbs and
shrubs and little people's lives. Then she continued
dispassionately:</p>

<p>"We used to go up to Folly's head about this time. The bracken
is all yellow...and the rabbits go scampering away under the ferns.
Do you remember the day he lost his hat? We hunted for it in rabbit
holes for half an hour and then he remembered that he'd never
brought one!"</p>

<p>She laughed mirthlessly and exclaimed: "That was so like Peter!
So like my Peter!"</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned on Decimus and threw herself in his
arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dessy dear, it isn't true! Tell me it isn't true! It's all
a mad dream. They can't take him. They can't take my Peter! They
can't take my Peter!"</p>

<p>Thank God, she was crying! The big friend of the family held her
tight. He stroked her disordered hair&mdash;beautiful, wavy, brown
hair&mdash;He was choking himself but he managed to say:</p>

<p>"There, there, it will be all right, dear...he'll come back!
He'll come back!"</p>

<p>But she clung to him and shook and gripped his arms
convulsively. And suddenly she laughed horribly, and Decimus was
frightened. He helped her to a couch and rang the bell for the
servants. With the help of Mrs. Yardley, the loyal and ancient
housekeeper of the Querrils, and one of the maids, they coaxed her
up to one of the bedrooms. And then Mrs. Yardley insisted on
putting her to bed, and giving her two hot-water bottles and some
sal-volatile. She had a great faith in hot-water bottles. There was
no ailment of body or soul that could not be to an extent relieved
by hot-water bottles. And her message of consolation was:</p>

<p>"There, there, dearie, we all have to go through it. You put one
on your feet and one on your tummy and you'll be all right."</p>

<p>In the meantime Decimus telephoned for the local doctor. And
then he thought to himself: "Poor child! I shall never forget that
laugh of hers. It was horrible, horrible! Nature is intensely
cruel. But this may help matters. It will be a diversion. Perhaps
just the very thing that was wanted!"</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>And indeed the breakdown of poor Annette was not without its
helpful side. When the family arrived an hour later, looking white
and disheveled, like a concourse of attendant ghosts hovering round
each other, Decimus was able to greet them with the arresting
announcement:</p>

<p>"Annette is here. We've put her to bed. I'm afraid she's very
unwell."</p>

<p>The news seemed to produce an immediate flush of vitality in the
group. They were converted from ghosts to animate creatures. All
the women-folk dashed up to the bedroom, their minds and bodies
occupied. The men went into the drawing-room with Decimus.</p>

<p>Mr. Querril looked older and somehow smaller. His face appeared
pinched, and he had not washed since the morning&mdash;a most
unusual and significant lapse&mdash;but he was extravagantly calm
and detached. He cross-questioned Decimus about Annette's collapse,
and asked which doctor he had telephoned to. When informed that it
was Dr. Fox, he remarked:</p>

<p>"Fox! I'm glad you sent for Fox. He's a good chap, takes a lot
of trouble and doesn't fuss. I like him better than Whitehead,
though Whitehead's clever. I believe he has taken more degrees and
so on, but he's brusk in his manner, and he always smells so
confoundedly of Harris tweed."</p>

<p>Of the trial, and of Peter, not a word! The process of closing
up spiritually had commenced. The boys hovered round their father
admiringly, but with an expression which seemed to suggest that
they thought that any minute he might vanish through the floor or
the ceiling. Only once that evening was there a definite breakdown.
During an interval of attending on Annette, Mrs. Querril, who was
sitting on the couch by the fire, suddenly burst into tears. She
was soothed in silence by Magda&mdash;who had come down with the
rest&mdash;Nothing was said.</p>

<p>Dinner was announced shortly afterwards, and Mrs. Querril said
she "really couldn't," but Magda took her arm and said:</p>

<p>"You must, darling."</p>

<p>And they went into the dining-room. No one ate anything, but
they all made a great show of flashing knives and forks, and
pretending to be comparatively normal. Martin drank an enormous
quantity of water, and Mrs. Querril was persuaded to have a glass
of port.</p>

<p>Decimus tried to keep his eye from the photograph of
Peter&mdash;an enlarged head&mdash;just above the sideboard, but it
kept wandering back to it, and the insistent voice of the
phrasemaker would still juggle with words:</p>

<p>"Broadly speaking there are two blocks of people, East and West;
people who interfere, and people who don't interfere; people who
are content, and people who have the genius of dissatisfaction. One
of our jocund poets has said, 'East is East, and West is West.'
This is only partly true. East is most certainly East, but West is
West and a bit more. West is West with a touch of North and South,
a touch of East, and a big touch of the stars. East is a fatalist,
and West is an idealist of a clumsy sort. East believes in a
millennium, a condition predicating a static condition of the soul;
West believes in pushing on the best way it can to a
better&mdash;but still fluid&mdash;order of society. 'Neither the
twain shall meet' said the jocund poet. But they will meet, because
the West will go out and meet the East, and in time will get to
know all about the East. For too long has the West been mesmerized
by the East, like a schoolboy in the presence of an aged
grandfather. And the West will in time absorb and control the East,
because it <i>is</i> more restless, because it <i>is</i>
dissatisfied, because it has greater vitality. And it is vitality
which counts. 'For that is the law of the Jungle, O Best
Beloved!'"</p>

<p>When everybody thought that the pantomime of eating was
finished, Mr. Querril suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I'd like some cheese."</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>This explosive demand seemed to arouse Mrs. Querril. She looked
round, with the expression of the hen-mother amidst a brood of
chicks suddenly conscious of her responsibilities.</p>

<p>"Lydia," she said, addressing a maid, "I believe there's some of
that Wensleydale left. Bring it in for the Master."</p>

<p>And the cheese formed an excellent topic for Mr. Querril to
dilate upon.</p>

<p>"Decimus, my dear good fellow, you must try some of this. It's
excellent, like a Stilton only milder. The flavor is very subtle. A
cousin of mine&mdash;James Querril, do you know him?-charming
fellow! runs a model farm near Whitby&mdash;he sent it to us at
Whitsuntide."</p>

<p>Mr. Querril talked exhaustively about cheeses, the rival flavors
of Cheshire, and Cheddar, the beauty of a "really good old
Stilton," about a restaurant in the Strand where you could get
Camembert thirty-five years old. And while he spoke, the mind of
the essayist was very busy:</p>

<p>"Now here is a remarkable example of Querrilism and indeed of
the Western temperament On such a night as this the Eastern would
have sat in a hair shirt in his temple, praying. He would have made
his women-folk do the same. He would have said, 'All is darkness
about me. My son is dead to me. He has sinned against Thy holy
covenant. Ah! woe is me! Woe is me! J But the Westerner in this
critical hour suddenly exclaims, 'I want some cheese.' Not because
he really wants cheese, but because he's not thinking of himself.
He's closing up his ranks spiritually. It's a stronger attack. It's
heroic. It's terrific!"</p>

<p>And so in the trials of that day Decimus discovered many
compensations, and one compensation that made him almost delirious.
Some time after dinner Magda touched his arm and said:</p>

<p>"Dessy, will you come up to&mdash;to the studio for a
moment?"</p>

<p>He followed her heavily to the top of the house. When they
entered the studio, she turned on the electric light and shut the
door. She peered about the room, and touched an overall of Peter's
that was hanging on an easel. And then to his surprise she suddenly
said:</p>

<p>"Oh, Decimus dear, hold me in your arms a moment. I want to cry.
I want to have a good cry."</p>

<p>Decimus did as he was bidden. For the second time that day he
became a father-confessor, the big friend of the family. But it was
somehow different holding Magda in his arms to holding Annette. He
was intensely conscious of the faint perfume of that beautiful hair
tickling his nose and chin. He was enthralled and flattered,
although he knew that the appeal was anything but flattering. He
knew quite well that she was merely using him as a medium of
relief. She wanted to cry with some one who didn't matter. He was
just outside the immediate circle of Querrilism, but not so far
outside that he could not be trusted to know how to behave. He was
sympathetic and quite safe. And Decimus knew all that, and it
wounded him a little, but he did know how to behave. Two large
tears trickled down his cheeks and mingled with her hair. She
dabbed her eyes with her handkerchief, and he felt her bosom
heaving as she gasped:</p>

<p>"Oh, darling Peter! Where is he now? What are they doing to him?
They'll kill him!"</p>

<p>And the big man replied hoarsely:</p>

<p>"No, no, Magda, he'll be all right Hell come back!"</p>

<p>She fumbled with his coat and her handkerchief, and continued
talking in little jerky sobs:</p>

<p>"It's all so cruel...Peter couldn't possibly have
understood...Why didn't some one tell him? He's only a little boy
himself. O God! He's not capable of doing anything wicked. Peter
has never had an unkind, cruel thought in his life. Peter is
innocent, pure, a darling! Everybody knows it...Oh, what does it
all mean, Dessy? What does it all mean?"</p>

<p>And the maker of epigrams could think of nothing better to say
than:</p>

<p>"He'll come back, Magda dear, he'll come back. Of course he
didn't understand..."</p>

<p>And then as though inspired by the collect of the day he
added:</p>

<p>"We must think of the others, Magda."</p>

<p>She squeezed his arm and gasped:</p>

<p>"Oh, I know, I know. It's the only thing that keeps one going at
all. But one has to cry sometimes if only in secret,
and&mdash;thank you so much, Dessy dear, you've been so sweet. I've
got to be so brave now, perhaps it's a little different for me.
Thank you so much. Let us go down. I won't make a fool of myself
again."</p>

<hr>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>In the hall they passed Ptolemy the Second. He came out of the
drawing-room, yawning. He walked languidly towards the kitchen,
stretching out each leg with a slow, ecstatic movement, as though
it were a form of sensuous joy not to be hurried over. On
perceiving Decimus, he put back his ears with an expression of
disgust, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Probably no one of "the Querril set" slept well that night, with
the exception of Annette, who had been given a powerful sleeping
draft. Though at dawn Magda slept for three hours, her hair
scattered in wild profusion on the pillow, but her face relaxed and
placid, like a child's.</p>

<p>And during the small hours Decimus enjoyed moments of at least
semi-consciousness. The leaves of the eternal book kept turning
backwards and forwards, the thoughts tumbling over each other:</p>

<p>"It resolves itself then into a question as to the degree to
which this principle of self-effacement may be applied. One cannot
quarrel with love as a principle. One can only insist that love
shall fortify and not stultify the individual. Love comes in so
many disguises...and the perfume of her hair...what is
it?...opoponax faintly...opoponax and something more, the essence
of life, tears and laughter...the breath of a woman standing in the
presence of a miracle..."</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>Chapter 12&mdash;Peter's Letter to
Tony Macdowell</h2>

<hr>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>"I am writing this diary to you, Tony, for a very good reason.
It is with the idea of keeping sane. My thoughts, feelings, black
terrors, and despairs are so confused that I want desperately to
detach some concrete arrangement from them. The act of setting
something down may be a sedative, however trifling and inconsequent
it may appear to read. So you see it is quite a selfish letter,
written more for my own benefit than for yours. My greatest
difficulty is to convince myself that I am indeed identically the
same person that I was before the trial, that the qualities I had
then are still mine. But everything works against this conviction.
The atmosphere of the court and the prison have mesmerized me into
a belief that I am an entirely different person, that virtues and
impulses and dreams which I then enjoyed are now the property of
some one else, and that they will never be mine again.</p>

<p>"During those early days when out of the clear blue vault of
heaven there came this sudden bolt of destruction, I was too
consumed with the aspect of the result to give much attention to
the cause. I was indeed only able to think of myself in relation to
the appalling cloud of sorrow I had brought into the lives of those
I loved. I could think of nothing but my mother's face as she
looked at me across the court, of my father, and of Martin, and
Rodney, and Magda, and Evelyn. It seemed incredible that I could
have been so cruel to them. It seemed incredible that any one, or
any system, or any form of social action, could be so cruel to any
one. The contemplation of their suffering nearly drove me mad. I
wished to God I had been an orphan without relatives of any sort,
and then perhaps I could have faced this thing in the spirit of a
man. I could have retained my individuality, and found some salve
within myself. As it was, the vision of my family's grief whipped
me into a thousand fragments, and when I came back to that poor
thing that was myself it seemed so pitiable an object it made me
shudder. Again and again I tried to encompass it, to take it by the
scruff of the neck and to say to it:</p>

<p>"Come now, it's not all finished.
Remember...remember...remember.'</p>

<p>"And for a time I lived in little episodes of my past life, and
tried to convince myself that they were real and intimate. I could
see Rodney missing a low drive of mine at tennis, and could hear
him calling out:</p>

<p>"'Oh, good shot, Pedro!'</p>

<p>"I could see Magda swaying on the piano stool, her shoulders
slightly raised as she weighed the keys, and her gentle voice:</p>

<p>"'A shade faster, darling.'</p>

<p>"I could hear Martin ragging me, and sometimes even my own voice
calling him 'a hoary old porpoise.'</p>

<p>"All these things were still mine. They couldn't take them away
from me if I fought hard for them.</p>

<p>"Of the unspeakable thing itself, I could only contemplate it in
its effects on these visual relations. In some ways I was surprised
at my own lack of compunction. Neither could I persuade myself that
the offense was of the vile nature which the law proscribed. I had
no standard of values in the matter to go by. I could only judge by
my intuitions, and I could not believe that any experience so
crowned by beauty, and so utterly devoid of any element which
appeared against the grain of nature or of instinct could be vile.
Even at that time I harbored some vague suspicion that there must
be a mistake. The sentence suggested cruelty, and God knows I am
not capable of cruelty, though there I found myself a passive
medium of the most unspeakable cruelty to my own parents and
brothers and sisters. If the other thing had been cruel and vile, I
cannot but believe that I should have had some inkling. That I
behaved rashly, that in very truth I 'lost my head,' I was
intensely conscious. But that I had wronged Emma, I could not
believe. All that was best in me was eager for her good. I had
determined&mdash;impulsively perhaps&mdash;to wrap my life round
hers. I was going to devote my whole time and energies in
furthering her happiness. I have often wished since that I had told
you of my feelings towards Emma.</p>

<p>"One day after I had been five weeks in this place we were
exercising in the yard. There was an unusual warmth in the air for
November. I looked up at the pale rim of sky above the roofs. I
thought inevitably of the sky above the heath, and I remembered a
certain night when I had seen Emma's face among the fruit trees in
the Lemaires' garden. The air had the tender feeling that suggests
that Nature is imparting a gentle caress upon the brow of all
humanity, and as though we were all being drawn closer together by
this act. It suddenly occurred to me that if I could only convince
myself that mine was a venial offense, it would be easier to help
my people; that the mute anguish which I knew they suffered might
become less. I might be able to find myself again, and to believe
that my individuality was identical to what it was before the
trial.</p>

<p>"For now let me set down a terrifying fact. No man is capable of
withstanding this black magic of the law. It mesmerizes, blinds,
and destroys one. Even if I had been entirely innocent but had been
found guilty, I could not have escaped that paralyzing sense of
being placed outside the pale. It is not like being condemned by
human beings but like being exorcised by the chilling verdict of
perpetuity.</p>

<p>"It seems to represent the opinion of all the inhuman ghosts who
have ever dared the boards of history, with its ponderous
solemnity, its medieval appanages, its uncompromising attention to
meticulous phrasing, its ice-cold insistence upon the letter of
precedent and tradition. It picks you up, looks right through you,
tears out your heart, and throws you aside&mdash;a thing that can
never find itself again, a thing that will always be afraid of its
own shadow.</p>

<p>"And this prison is full of these husks, these gray bodies
mesmerized into the belief that they have lost their soul. I see
around me their white faces, grinning pitiably in a kind of weak
obedience to an elemental fate. It was in the contemplation of them
that my own revolt began. With almost a sense of satisfaction I
realized that I could pity them even more than I pitied myself. And
then I knew that something of me in any case was as it was before
the trial. And I fought for that thing with all my might I reasoned
that if I had that faculty I probably had other faculties. I
yearned to help them, and so by this means I gradually began to
reinstate myself. And it was partly under the influence of this
revelation that I began to write these thoughts down.</p>

<p>"Other convictions crowd upon me, and one central fact which I
could hardly realize when living at Chessilton Heath. I sometimes
had vague suspicions of it when working at the Settlement at
Hammersmith, but here I feel it established beyond dispute. It is
this: The <i>majority</i> of people are unhappy, Tony. One may say
that in the position I find myself I am not an unprejudiced
observer, but I am not judging by the pale ghosts who surround me
here. I am speaking from an acquired experience and from
observation. And the reflection is appalling. I italicize the word
<i>majority</i>, because that is the whole point of the indictment.
If a few people were unhappy, or even a fairly large minority, it
might be explicable; but think of this&mdash;Here we have the whole
of human society evolved through millions of years of suffering,
and sacrifice, and love. We have the experience of millions of men
and races. We have the vast stores of their labors to help us, the
comfort of their faiths, the revelations of their teachers and our
own. We have the benefit of the restless strivings of reformers,
artists, seers. And with all this, what have we built?&mdash;a
house of Fear!</p>

<p>"We may build a little nest at the top, like our home at
Ghessilton Heath. We may be happy ourselves, but down beneath is
that vast groaning basement of despair, and all the dark rooms of
misery and hopelessness, where Fear stalks exultantly. Sometimes he
even comes up and bares his yellow fangs at us, and we shrink
together, mesmerized. And often we go down and grope our way into
the dark rooms, murmuring to these others:</p>

<p>"'It's all right! It's all right!'</p>

<p>"And we distribute our little doles of soup, and soap, and
patent pills, but we do not drive out Fear. The house is haunted
like this prison. Somewhere, at sometime, something has gone
wrong.</p>

<p>"I am not going to write about this prison life. I am writing
these notes to you for my own benefit, and one reason is that they
help me to forget it for the time being. They are a means of
spiritual egress, and they enable me to put my thoughts in some
kind of order. Neither will I attempt to set down my anguish of
those early days, my fear of madness, and the ever-present shadow
of that figure of self-destruction. I only want to emphasize the
fact that the greatest trouble was the scaring sense of contrast,
the knowledge of my people's thoughts and feelings every moment of
the day. And when I struck the rock-bottom of pity and self-pity, I
began' to realize that you were right; so desperate did I become,
that I began to be aware that there was something wrong even in the
wonderful atmosphere of our home. The question of food was a
pertinent factor. When a rough bowl of skilly was thrust at me, I
would be tortured by the reflection of what my mother was thinking
that I was thinking. When they sat down to meals, they would always
think about certain foods that Peter liked, Peter's favorite
dishes, and various cranky fancies that Peter 'must always have.'
And they would be thinking of that, and wondering what Peter was
having now. It seemed a silly and trivial point, but it was
terrible to bear. It was not as though it really mattered what I
ate. I am not really particular, but I was tortured by this
overlapping of too great consideration and sympathy. And I
remembered a day when I sat on the rock at Sheringham and
everything seemed so big. Was there perhaps after all something
petty and trivial about my family? I cannot yet quite focus the
question; it only seems to me that when we come up against the
great realities, with our tradition and training, we are apt to be
'unfitted.' Perhaps we are thoroughly too self-detached, too
impersonal. Even in our work at the Treves Settlement, Martin,
Rodney and I, do we ever get in touch with the root of the matter?
I am not sure that we are not just an excrescence, a thing that has
no permanent influence. Compared to Jim Trim and Castro, we are
amateurs in the social struggle. We are too quick to believe that
life is an affair of good and evil, whereas when we meet it face to
face we find so much more.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the most terrible factor of prison life is that one is
robbed of all faculty of individual expression. To an artist this
is hell. One is robbed of everything which is the natural right of
the individual, whether moral or immoral. One lives only
introspectively and in dreams. When I first came here I could not
sleep, and my dreams were ghoulish, and though I still do not sleep
well my dreams are sometimes beautiful and comforting.</p>

<p>"And the other night I had a queer dream about you, Tony. I was
strolling along the cliff at Babbicombe with you. I remember going
down that zigzag path to the shore, and we wandered for some time
and then sat down on the sand. The sky was immense, and the narrow
line of sea that turgid gray-green color you see in some of
Whistler's water-colors. The waves were breaking in little angry
ripples. And suddenly, close by us on the shore, I observed a
woman. She was tall and very beautiful, and dressed in a
shell-colored frock. She was gazing out to sea, with her lips
parted, and her eyes reflecting the restless movement of the
waters.</p>

<p>"There was something so appealing and splendid about her I could
not take my eyes from her. At last I whispered to you:</p>

<p>"'Who is that?'</p>

<p>"And you were busy sketching in a note-book, but replied
casually:</p>

<p>"'Oh, that's the fore-shore woman.'</p>

<p>"'The fore-shore woman!' I said. 'What do you mean by a
fore-shore woman?'</p>

<p>"You did not reply, and I added:</p>

<p>"'Why does she gaze out to sea?'</p>

<p>"Then you said:</p>

<p>"'Did you ever see any one stand on the shore and gaze at the
land?'</p>

<p>"I had to acknowledge that the sea perhaps had a greater appeal,
and yon continued, sententiously:</p>

<p>"'The sea is something of an aristocrat. You must remember that
at one time the world was <i>all</i> sea. That's why the sea looks
upon the land as rather bourgeois, as a sort of <i>nouveau
arrive</i>, and that's why the sea is always lashing the skirts of
the land with these white thongs.'</p>

<p>"'But who is the fore-shore woman?' I insisted.</p>

<p>"'The fore-shore woman is the only thing he is afraid of,' you
replied. 'You see he made the love light in her eyes. That's why he
doesn't overrun the land. He knows that if he has once made the
love light he daren't destroy it. And every year he becomes less
and less. He's wearing himself out with anger, and his own mad love
of her. For it isn't for him the love light was created.'</p>

<p>"'Who was it created for then?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, some thug way over the other side of his horizon.' And you
laughed.</p>

<p>"'Tony,' I said, 'you are keeping something back from me. I seem
to know her. I have seen those eyes before, either in this life or
in some previous existence. I must know her. Who is she?'</p>

<p>"But you merely shrugged your shoulders, and rubbing a portion
of your sketch down with the ball of your thumb you repeated:</p>

<p>"'She's the fore-shore woman!'</p>

<p>"How much older I seem now than you, Tony! I am an old man and
you will always be a boy, wiping out a sketch with the ball of your
thumb. Sometimes these queer dreams come to me and help me; but for
the most part I live among uncertain realities, I live among
uncertain realities."</p>

<p>This sentence was repeated, and the letter came to an abrupt
stop.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter 13&mdash;Tony in
Request</h2>

<hr>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>It surprised many people that the Querrils did not leave
Chessilton Heath. The general view was that in such cases it is
better to clear out and make a fresh start elsewhere. The affair
created considerable discussion and a pretty broad social cleavage.
Many families cut them definitely, but the majority remained loyal,
and their more intimate friends treated them with a greater show of
affection than ever. The orthodox opinion was expressed by Sir
Phillip Lowring, the local brewer and art patron. He said to his
wife:</p>

<p>"I shouldn't cut them, my dear, but I shouldn't be too friendly.
Old Querril is not a bad sort in his way. A man can't help having a
profligate son. There's usually a black sheep in every family."</p>

<p>Those who knew them well knew that to move would be the last
thing they would be likely to do. It would be disloyal to Peter, a
betrayal of their most sacred sentiments, a confession that they
could not endure "the instruments of torture."</p>

<p>It was a relief when the tennis court could be dismantled, but
the photographs of Peter in his velvet suit, his sailor suit, in
his many other costumes, remained conspicuously in evidence. Some
one eventually folded up the gray flannel trousers, and put them
away in a drawer, and the box of charcoal was closed and put in a
cupboard with the pipes, but everything else remained identically
the same, from the unfinished painting of "Spring" to the
butterfly-net and the ghost-like overall awaiting its owner.</p>

<p>And on the days when visitors were allowed to visit the prison,
Mrs. Querril would put on her best black satin frock ( it is always
well to dress in your best when visiting a prison), and she would
keep herself remarkably well in hand. She would peer at the ghostly
and almost unrecognizable Peter through two rows of iron bars and
always began with the same remark:</p>

<p>"It won't be long, darling. Everything is waiting for you.
Everything will be just the same when you come home."</p>

<p>The conversations were extraordinarily difficult and
embarrassing. The really big things could not be talked about. It
was far worse than talking on a telephone. The dialogue consisted
mostly of scrappy bits of information about the family and friends,
and a brave show on Peter's part of being quite comfortable and
cared for. It was almost a relief to both sides when the warder
gave the signal that time was up.</p>

<p>But during the ensuing winter both Mr. and Mrs. Querril aged
considerably. Mr. Querril's stoop became more pronounced, his
movements fussier and jerkier, and his conversations more
discursive and meandering. And his wife began to develop that
symptom which characterizes many elderly people&mdash;of living
almost exclusively in the past. It was as though her mind had
stopped in that fatal October. She was the only member of the
family who was allowed occasionally to break down when some little
symbol of association became too poignant. And after the first
flush of this revived grief, she would begin to talk quite openly
about Peter, but always of the past.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>She would tell her friends little stories of Peter when he was a
small boy, or quote some quaint saying of his when quite a baby.
And this did not seem to distress her. In these moods she seemed to
be able to pull down the shutter over these present terrible
happenings.</p>

<p>They went through those months brokenhearted and silently
disconsolate, each one struggling to bear the burden cheerfully
"for the sake of the others." They abolished games and the Sunday
evening music, but occasionally in a mood which almost amounted to
bravado they would all go and sit in Peter's studio and talk or
read, and on one or two occasions experimented with the gramophone,
but on one of these occasions Mrs. Querril broke down, and they did
not play it again. When Mrs. Querril had dried her eyes, she said
to Aunt Lena, who happened to be staying there at the time:</p>

<p>"He was such a boy for fruit, my dear. Do you remember that
occasion when old Sir George Bulbridge found him in his orchard
eating his apples, and Sir George came up and said very
sarcastically: 'Oh! and may I ask why you are eating my apples?'
and Peter said without any hesitation: 'Yes, sir&mdash;for medical
reasons.' And it was quite true. He was only eight at that time,
and you know what boys are; he had had some trouble, and the doctor
had told him he must eat all the fruit he could. Oh, dear! Oh,
dear! He wasn't such a bad old fellow, old Sir George; he told the
story against himself afterwards. I didn't know him. I only got to
hear it through the Tracys, those picture-gallery people over at
Clemin-Stratton. They were so amused! 'Medical reasons'! Peter was
always like that!"</p>

<p>Christmas, more like a chapter from the Inquisition than a week
of festival, came and went, and the months crawled by. The Treves
Settlement ceased to exist. It never survived the public scandal
brought upon it by Peter's case. All sorts of wild rumors regarding
it were spread broadcast and even got into the press. Abuse of it
came from those who had benefited by its activities, as well as
from people who knew nothing about it. The gentle Mrs. Basingstoke
closed the place down and went up to Leeds, where she continued her
good work on identically the same lines. She regretted parting with
the Querrils, and the Parthian shaft, which sprang to her lips when
she said good-by to Rodney: "Good-by, Mr. Querril. If you had taken
my advice. If you hadn't interfered..." was never spoken. Instead
she held his hand and said:</p>

<p>"I'm grieved that our work together is over. But don't lose
heart. You boys, all the three of you, are young. You've got all
the world before you."</p>

<p>The Querrils never heard from her again. When she died three
years later, as the result of an accident to her spine, caused by
being knocked down in the street by a drunken carter in the suburbs
of Leeds, she was a comparatively poor woman. She had given all her
life and money to the poor, because she could think of nothing
better to do. And she passed quite unnoticed.</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Two events of great importance happened to the Querrils in the
spring. The first was the arrival of Tony MacDowell. He came back
at the beginning of May and went straight down to Chessilton Heath.
His presence acted like a tonic. There was no reserve about Tony,
no family stranglehold upon his power of individual expression. He
went straight in to Mrs. Querril and gripped her hand and said:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Querril, I was fair dazed to hear about Peter. The thing
simply got me. Don't you believe it; there's some crazy mistake
about all this. Peter's a white man, through and through. I'd go
through hell for him."</p>

<p>No one else would dream of talking to Mrs. Querril like this. In
fact, no one else would think of broaching the subject of Peter at
all, but Mrs. Querril did not seem to mind. On the contrary, her
face flushed slightly with pleasure. She pressed his hand and
murmured:</p>

<p>"Mr. MacDowell! Mr. MacDowell!"</p>

<p>She did not cry, as the rest of the family dreaded. She gazed
meekly out of the window as though she were suddenly confronted
with some new and encouraging aspect of the case. Tony was
persuaded to stay, and his visit was a complete success.</p>

<p>Of course there was no idea of his being a kind of substitute
for Peter, but he did quite unconsciously to a certain extent enact
that part. He was a boy in the house, of about the same age, and
Peter was fond of him. He did the same kind of work, and
entertained them all day with his quaint philosophy and his
unexpected way of expressing himself. He was quite impervious to
the "instruments of torture." He talked continually about Peter and
his work, in a matter-of-fact way, as though Peter was away staying
with friends. And Mrs. Querril liked to listen to him. The striking
difference in their mental attitude was that Mrs. Querril would
only talk of Peter's past, and Tony would only talk of Peter's
future.</p>

<p>And it did not seem sacrilege for Tony to use Peter's studio.
Peter would like it. Besides, Tony was principally a portrait
painter, which seemed to make just a comfortable difference. He
painted portraits of Evelyn, and Mrs. Lemaire (Magda was not well
enough to sit). He did odd jobs about the house, mended the
lawnmower, washed the dogs, "jollied" the family when they were
down, put them wise on the suffrage question which was then raging,
of which he was a keen advocate, criticized their friends and
neighbors, beat them at tennis, gave Mr. Querril advice about the
way to conduct a literary review, fetched parcels from the station,
and acted as a veritable <i>deus ex machina</i> on the night when
Magda's baby was born.</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Which brings us to the second important event. There is
something about the clamorous arrival of a baby which is
irresistible. It may be said in some respects to resemble an
aeroplane&mdash;in that, although we may have seen thousands in our
time, whenever we hear one we have to rush to the window. All
babies are remarkable, in fact they are all more remarkable than
any other babies, but Magda's baby was of course more remarkable
than the most remarkable baby that ever yelled its way into popular
imagination. It was a girl, and of course was called Jenny after
Mrs. Querril. If the alternative disaster had happened to it, it
was to have groped with the problems of life under the name of
George. As an antidote to the febrile atmosphere of the household
at that time, Jenny was immense. She cared not for Querrils or
Capels, nor for tradition or sentiment, nor even for the welfare of
a dissolute uncle slinking in prison. She arrived with a
self-centered determination to get a grip on life. She took
stage-center with the assurance of a popular musical-comedy artist
In comparison, Ptolemy the Second was an altruist. For anything not
concerning a bottle or her immediate material demands, she had no
use.</p>

<p>A new light seemed to come into Mrs. Querril's eyes. She went
backwards and forwards between the various bedrooms, examining
first the child, then the mother, then the things she had been so
laboriously making in anticipation of this event. Before being
fully conscious in the morning she would again feel diffused with
the prescience of some pleasant experience. And when she did awake
her first thought was:</p>

<p>"Yes. It is quite true. Now there is another one...little Jenny.
How sweet she looked when she laughed at my hand-mirror yesterday.
I wonder whether Martin has his camera down here. Her eyes are
lighter than Magda's. I suppose they're more like John's. But any
one can see she's a Querril."</p>

<p>When John arrived a fortnight later on a special "compassionate
leave," he had to be reprimanded and called to order. He obviously
knew nothing about babies. He tossed it up into the air and caught
it, and made such an incredible noise, shouting and singing, that
they were terrified. He held it in such an awkward way that Mrs.
Querril was convinced he would drop it, or make it cry.</p>

<p>It must be said for Miss Capel that she took all this in very
good part. She blinked surprisingly at the owner of the clear gray
eyes and the boisterous manners, as though she recognized that he
was a god with some peculiar authority to interfere with her
autocratic existence. She gripped handfuls of his face, and gurgled
with satisfaction when the mouth made abortive efforts to bite
her.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Capel had only three days' leave, and it was a very
crowded time, but on his last evening after dinner he suddenly took
Tony by the lapel of his coat and said:</p>

<p>"I say, MacDowell, come down the garden with me. I want to have
a chat."</p>

<p>When they had reached the shrubbery at the other end of the
garden, and pipes had been duly filled and lighted, Capel said:</p>

<p>"You were away at the time of the trial, weren't you,
MacDowell?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was in Italy."</p>

<p>"I was there two days. The second day, and the day of the
conviction."</p>

<p>John hesitated, and then interjected:</p>

<p>"I suppose you haven't any time on your hands?"</p>

<p>"My time's my own, thank God! If there's anything I can
do..."</p>

<p>"It's like this. I can't do much. I'm so tied up. But there were
things about the trial that struck me as quaint There was a man
named Castro&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, the Dago!"</p>

<p>"Yes. That man would sell his own mother for a quart of gin. I
didn't believe a word of his evidence. Jim Troon's not much better.
I saw them enter a pub together immediately after the result was
announced. I didn't like their manners. There was something oily.
They were much too pleased about it all. I got some one on their
track. They both went on the blind for days. They spent money like
dirt. One night they had a quarrel, and Castro said something about
blabbing if the other man didn't hand over some more brass. Then
they made it up, and Troon went back to Hammersmith, and Castro
disappeared. And we can't find any trace of him at all. He probably
took ship somewhere, but we can't find any seaman registered under
that name, and we can get nothing out of Troon."</p>

<p>The gray face of Tony MacDowell appeared watchful and alert
above his pipe.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to track Castro? Is that the idea, Capel?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to convert you into a bally detective, but I'd
like to get hold of Mr. Castro."</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Tony looked up at the white gables of the house. Then he
said:</p>

<p>"I take it you have some idea about this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's quite a simple idea. I don't believe that Emma Troon
was under sixteen!"</p>

<p>"Gee! I'd give ten years of my life to prove that! I wish they'd
let me know. Heading the account it all seemed such plain sailing.
It never occurred&mdash;that there could be any loophole&mdash;in
an English court, with all those bigwigs! There was the
birth-certificate and all."</p>

<p>"I know. I have no definite grounds to go on. It's simply an
instinct. You had to be at the trial to appreciate it. In the first
place, the girl looks more like eighteen or nineteen. Of course
she's Italian stock. Then her father is a moral pervert, and all
the witnesses they called looked as though they ought to be in
jail. And then there's Peter. Is Peter the sort of chap who would
seduce a little girl? Of course he acknowledges that he slept the
night with her, and that he had had something to drink. But you
know what he is. His own lawyer couldn't get out of him the proper
details of that night. He said he had been a blackguard and lost
his head. Even in court he didn't say what his lawyer had put him
up to say, although he put him into the box on purpose. He was an
appalling witness. He talked about the Russian ballet, and all that
sort of thing. You never heard such stuff! Of Course the jury
immediately jumped to the conclusion that he was a moral pervert.
Any reference to art or the emotions will convince a British jury
that you're a wrong 'un."</p>

<p>Tony followed this impression of John's with little intermittent
ejaculations of "My!" Then he gripped the other's hand and
said:</p>

<p>"Listen now, John; you've no idea how I appreciate your telling
me all this. I was always dead sure that Peter was a white man, but
my! an English court of law!...Well, now, just give me Troon's
address, and I'll get right on to this."</p>

<p>The lieutenant's eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"I had an idea you'd be a good man for this job! I believe I
hear the baby."</p>

<p>The lieutenant sprang down the embankment and ran across the
garden. And Tony watched him go. A few minutes later he heard his
invigorating laugh in the little room above the cherry tree. A warm
glow of light irradiated from the window. The cries of the child
subsided. He thought he heard Magda's voice. A nightingale started
the prelude to its song, in the hedge beyond the Lemaires' garden.
And Tony continued sitting there on the wooden bench, and smoking.
He never took his eyes from the little window. It looked like an
illuminated nest up in the trees. And a queer expression came to
his plain features. He was thinking very hard. But who could tell
what would be the thoughts of a superphilosopher at such a
moment?</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>On the following day Tony MacDowell vanished. When he announced
his intention of going, there was a chorus of dismay, but he
said:</p>

<p>"If o, I must go. I was getting on fine here till this baby
came, and now I feel I'm superseded. I'm just jealous."</p>

<p>And Magda said:</p>

<p>"Oh! Tony, you <i>mustn't</i> go! What will Jenny do without
you?"</p>

<p>"Believe me, Jenny's as good at looking after number one as Tony
MacD is!"</p>

<p>"But where are you going, Tony MacD?"</p>

<p>"I'm going up to that crazy little hamlet of London to see
whether father has taken home the washing."</p>

<p>"You're an enigma, Tony MacD. I believe you're just going up
there to enjoy yourself. We bore you already."</p>

<p>"Sure. I'm bored stiff&mdash;at having to go."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you send father a prepaid reply telegram to find out
whether he's taken home the washing?"</p>

<p>"The washing wouldn't be worth the price of the telegram.
Besides, I've got to find father first. He's probably in one of
these fashionable British rendezvous&mdash;the booze joint."</p>

<p>"You'll come back soon, Tony MacD?"</p>

<p>The boy looked at her with his queer eyes, and the playful twist
of the conversation seemed to desert him. He hung his head and said
solemnly:</p>

<p>"I'll always be there when you want me, lady."</p>

<p>The departure of Tony was almost overlooked that evening,
through the effect caused by the startling news which Rodney
brought down with him. Since the demise of the Treves Settlement,
the surplus energies of Rodney had been swept into the vortex of
the woman's suffrage movement. He was always attending meetings and
discussions, and going to breakfasts given to suffragettes released
from jail. He talked at home about the activities of the various
societies, and about their leaders and organizers. Among others he
talked considerably about Ebba Janssen, a Swedish girl.</p>

<p>It would be idle to pretend that the rest of the family&mdash;in
the midst of the absorbing episode of the arrival of
Jenny&mdash;paid any detailed attention to this information, nor
that it occurred to any of them that the name of Ebba Janssen stood
for anything more than an automaton in connection with Rodney's
new-found interests. But on this evening, according to a recognized
Querrilian tradition affecting the imparting of important news,
Rodney arrived home looking very flushed, got hold of Martin, and
took him up to his room. And Martin came down a little later, and
took Magda on one side. And Magda told Evelyn, and then the two
girls broke the news to their mother that Rodney was engaged!</p>

<p>And then Mrs. Querril went upstairs to Rodney alone, and kissed
him and cried a little, and said:</p>

<p>"I hope you'll be happy, darling."</p>

<p>And while she was upstairs, Martin broke the news to Mr.
Querril, who said:</p>

<p>"God bless my soul! You don't say so!"</p>

<p>He blew his nose, and added:</p>

<p>"Well, this is a surprise! I'd no idea. A Swedish girl! We must
ask her down for the week end."</p>

<p>When he saw Rodney, he shook his hand and spluttered:</p>

<p>"My dear boy, well, well! I'd no idea. I'd no idea at all!"</p>

<p>Then he asked rather plaintively:</p>

<p>"May we...are you asking her down?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm bringing her down on Saturday."</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>On Saturday Ebba Janssen made her first appearance at Chessilton
Heath. And the visit could not be described as a success. For the
first time in the history of the family there appeared the germs of
a cleavage. The mere suggestion that such a thing could happen was
in itself sufficient to cause consternation.</p>

<p>Magda and Evelyn did their very best, but they could not like
Ebba Janssen.</p>

<p>She was a tall girl, older than Rodney, with a round smooth face
and rather colorless eyes. She had a certain dignity of carriage
and pretty fair hair, but there was a hardness and austerity about
her which the girls found disconcerting.</p>

<p>They kissed her effusively when she arrived, and she seemed
rather surprised. She looked clever in a narrow way, but without
humor or any broad feeling of sympathy. She was apparently fond of
Rodney, over whom she had already acquired a kind of proprietary
air, and she seemed to resent the fussy and endearing claims of the
rest of the family to him.</p>

<p>She admired the garden, and the heath, and the baby, in the same
staccato tones. She talked impassively about hygiene, and politics,
the program of the Women's Party, the excellence of German
municipal organization, the superiority of everything Swedish, the
appalling condition of English slums, the ignorance and viciousness
of the English lower classes, the way to cook food so as to extract
the utmost nutriment out of it, the way to organize education in
the interests of the State, the way to produce the moral
citizen.</p>

<p>She frowned disapprovingly at Decimus, who came in during the
afternoon, and was apparently so disgusted with his extravagant way
of talking that she took Rodney's arm and strolled away to the
other end of the garden.</p>

<p>"Isn't it awful!" said Evelyn to Magda, after she had gone. "She
has no color!"</p>

<p>Poor Evelyn! She was all color, and she felt it very much. Magda
could not deny that she was disappointed. She was not the sort of
girl she had dreamed of for Rodney, but&mdash;Jenny was crying, she
must go to her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Querril remarked dubiously:</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, my dear. I'm sure she's very sweet."</p>

<p>When Rodney had gone with her to the station, Mr. Querril rubbed
his hands and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Well, well...a very charming girl! Very charming indeed!"</p>

<p>Nobody answered him, and they all knew that he knew that they
knew that he was lying.</p>

<p>Martin said nothing, but he went out and dug very viciously in
the vegetable garden.</p>

<p>Decimus delivered a dissertation to Mr. Querril on the European
situation:</p>

<p>"That Autocrat&mdash;Democracy! He is getting nearer and nearer.
He wants to lay his hands on our babies, our bath towels, even our
cabbages are not safe. They have got to be cooked in a certain way.
I should never be surprised if, as a prelude, he doesn't plunge the
whole of Europe into war. That will be simply like bursting in the
front door. When he gets inside the house, his patent
carpet-sweepers and disinfectants will be overpowering. The Teutons
hate us because, although we never get up in the morning, we're
always getting the early worm. And when we've got the early worm we
never know what to do with it. The German would convert it into
quite an acceptable liver-sausage."</p>

<p>"Oh, rubbish! Decimus," laughed Mr. Querril. "You're always
trotting out that old bogey of the German menace. The Germans are
much too sensible. Too material, if you like. It wouldn't pay."</p>

<p>"None of these things are thought out on paper, Querril. No man,
or even group of men, sit down and think them out. They're only the
instruments of herd-instincts, and the underswell of humanity. And
there is only one movement at the present day that is irresistible.
That is the movement of democracy, which is another name for social
evolution."</p>

<p>"Well, what has the German menace got to do with democracy?"</p>

<p>"Everything. If you had a sore on your body and it came to a
head&mdash;excuse my disgusting metaphor, it's the only one that
occurs to me-you would say to that sore, 'Get on or get out.' As I
see it, the German sore is reaching a head. And underneath is the
body of humanity that is fed up, absolutely fed up to the teeth,
that is, in fact, rotten with sores. The majority of people are
underpaid, underfed, and overworked, worried, and they mean to
demand their pound of flesh. This Prussian sore will burst from the
inside. All these Zabern gentlemen will simply be used as a pick to
break open the door of the house. They themselves will run down the
steep place into the sea and be lost in the underswell."</p>

<p>Mr. Querril laughed, and dug his friend in the ribs.</p>

<p>"You're a disconcerting old pessimist," he said. "I must go and
cut that hedge!"</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>That same evening a tug delivered a bag of mail to H.M.S.
<i>Alcibiades</i>. In it was a letter addressed to Lieut. J. Capel.
That gentleman was at the moment playing deck-hockey. He broke away
from the game at the sound of the bugle, expecting a letter from
Magda&mdash;as he had not heard from her since the previous day. To
his disappointment it was in a strange handwriting. He opened it,
and perceived the signature of Tony MacDowell. And this is what
Tony wrote:</p>

<p class="letter">My dear J. C.:<br>
<br>
"I have had a busy week on this detective stunt without much
success. So far the Dago eludes me entirely. Mrs. Troon and I are
as thick as thieves. I gave her a pound. I think I could have
bought her body and soul for ten cents. But she is a complete dud.
I think she's on the square all right, but she knows nothing at
all. It's the earlier part of Jim's life that might prove
interesting. However, I got certain information out of her, and
have established one curious fact. That is that for years Jim has
been spending about thirty shillings or two pounds a week more than
he earns! I figured it out this way. I found out from Mrs. Troon
what he allows her, and what he buys and so on. Then I made a good
friend of a Mr. Bennett at a sweet spot called 'The Cuttle Fish.' I
followed Jim about for days and checked his drinks. I collaborated
with friend Bennett over the matter, and he struck a fair average
for his booze ticket. I next got together with a nobleman who
oversees the stone-masons' yard where Jim works. Be was not
squeamish about informing me of Jim's weekly emolument. (He wasn't
exactly on the water wagon himself! They are a pretty bunch down
this way!) Curse this English coinage! It fair drives me crazy! but
I managed to arrive at the computation I have mentioned. I next
tackled Jim himself. I told him I was from an attorney who had
information that some money had been left Castro by an aunt in
South Africa, and could he put me on to him. The only answer to
this was a challenge to fight. I didn't fancy getting mixed up in a
scrap with an express train falling over an embankment, so I
equivocated on this point. I managed to buy him off, but I couldn't
get him to talk. Mrs. Troon says that if she mentions Castro he
throws the furniture at her. He was certainly in a right and proper
fury with me at the mention. Jim and Castro have evidently had a
pretty useful quarrel.<br>
<br>
"I next sought out Emma Troon. I found her at Grete's flat, as the
detective who was last employed by the Querrils said she was. It
was in the middle of the afternoon, and I regret to say the lady
was lightly inebriated. She was drinking Kmmel when I got there
and was absolutely at a loose end. I don't think she knew anything
about Castro. Grete was away, and she seemed to me any man's
plaything&mdash;apart from the drink. She was living the high life,
and honestly I believe she's already forgotten all about Peter. He
was only a stepping stone to more alluring episodes. I agree with
you. She's a good nineteen. At her present rate she'll be ninety
next year. I mean to hang on here and nose about. It drives me
crazy to think that Peter should have been sacrificed to all this
city front slush.<br>
<br>
Yours sincerely,<br>
TONY MacD.</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>It was nearly a month later that John Capel, returning from
manoeuvers in the North Sea, found among his mail at Rosyth five
telegrams. They were all from Tony MacDowell, and they were all
couched in very similar language. They merely implied that Tony was
on the track of something, that he very urgently wanted to see
John, and that he was to be found at the Midland Hotel, Glasgow.
Owing to certain mysterious reasons, all leave was stopped, or very
much curtailed, to the navy. By exercising great circumlocution
John managed to secure forty-eight hours. It is only a few hours'
run to Glasgow, and he wired to Tony that he would be there that
night.</p>

<p>He found the American boy pacing the vestibule of the hotel and
looking anxious and drawn. John gripped his hand, and they retired
to a secluded corner of the palm court. Without any unnecessary
preamble Tony said:</p>

<p>"I've got him right here."</p>

<p>John's face lighted up with excitement.</p>

<p>"Good man!" he exclaimed. "Tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"I got hold of that fellow you put on to track Jim and Castro
around London, and I pumped him dry of anything he'd seen op heard.
There was nothing doing really except the night when he overheard
part of the quarrel, and Castro threatened to blab. The only little
illuminating thing he heard apart from that, was a remark of Jim's
when he said, 'All right, you can bloody well go back to
Pannantoga!'</p>

<p>"It was a bit thin, but it was all I had to go on. I got busy at
the shipping offices, trying to find out how a man would go to the
&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; place. I'd never heard of it. I found
out that it was an island somewhere in the Southern Pacific. There
was no direct route. He might go to Australia for a start, or he
might go through 'Frisco or Vancouver. I worried around Millwall
for a couple of days, and then I got a kind of conviction he'd be
more likely to go 'Frisco way. I went up to Liverpool and hung
around the docks, and visited shipping offices, and got on every
one's nerves. One evening, some guy in a saloon where I'd gone on
the off-chance got talking to me, and I put my proposition to him.
And he says, 'Why, if I wanted to go, I'd get aboard one of those
Jessamine boats what sails from Glasgow to Iquique. And from there
there's a dandy service of fruit boats with all the South Sea
Islands.' I don't know how it was, but this suggestion got me. I
felt that that was the way Castro would go. Anyway, one gets cold
feet sitting around. So I bundled along to Glasgow right away. I
found there was a ship sailing for Iquique in three days' time. I
hung about the docks there, and went up the Clyde and visited all
the pubs in Greenock and Gourock, and then back to Glasgow. My God!
What a place!</p>

<p>"I was in a fever of impatience to get a move on somewhere, and
it all seemed like hunting for a scarf-pin you've dropped in the
desert. On the night before the boat sailed for Iquique I visited a
downtown music hall near the docks. I was feeling dead-beat. I just
went there in the vague hope of seeing my man. I'd got him
visualized to a hair from your friend's description and from Mrs.
Troon's.</p>

<p>"I sat there watching the show. The same old stunts we get
delivered across to us everywhere. Comedians, bicyclists,
baritone-barmaids, and all the rest of it. And then a little Jap
came on. His name was Yoshio Hiroshige. He was a wrestler. His
manager came on and announced that they would pay a hundred pounds
to any man that Hiroshige couldn't throw in five minutes! Golly! it
was rather amusing. I got interested in the damn thing. Pour men
came up, one after another&mdash;hefty great dockhands and
fighters. They hardly seemed to get their stance, before Yoshio had
got a grip on them in some funny way and down they went. The house
rocked with laughter. And I laughed myself. And then suddenly the
laughter died on my lips. <i>Walking up the plank on to the stage
and grinning like an organ-grinder was&mdash;my Dago,
Castro</i>!</p>

<p>"I'd have sworn to him in a million. He'd got the weal on his
left cheek, Mrs. Troon had told me about. He was the exact height
and build, and he had the funny springy walk.</p>

<p>"He took his stance and every one laughed, expecting to see him
go down like the rest. The Jap made his spring, but Castro seemed
to draw himself in like a great ball. The Jap's clutch missed and
Castro's arms shot out, and Toshio only just missed being hugged
himself. There was a gasp of surprise. Castro evidently knew
something about the game. He grinned, and sidled like a great cat.
Then he made a spring that Yosh countered but didn't enjoy. They
broke away again. The referee announced that one minute was up.
Everybody got excited. This was going to be some game. They squared
up and made a simultaneous spring. There was a real dandy mix up,
and they broke away again and the referee announced two minutes.
Yosh was getting a little anxious, you could see. He looked a nasty
little customer, but Castro didn't look pleasant either. He wasn't
grinning, but he was snarling and saying insulting things-I should
imagine&mdash;under his breath. Suddenly the Jap whipped in and got
a lock around the Dago's knees, and brought him down. They rolled
in a heap on the ground, and I thought our man was finished. But he
did some funny business round the other's neck, like a dog shaking
a rat. When eventually they fell apart again four minutes was up!
Everybody was fair crazy with excitement, yelling mostly to the
Dago to hold out. The thing got me, so I'd clean forgotten what I
was there for. But suddenly I felt scared. I was looking at the
Jap, and I noticed something about his eyes I didn't like. Castro
had hurt him&mdash;I was sure of it. His little slits of eyes
seemed to narrow to a knife edge, but, by God! they looked
dangerous. I don't know how it was, but I felt it all coming. I
felt like yelling out: 'Castro, get out of the ring, you bloody
fool! He's going to kill you!' But my tongue seemed glued to the
roof of my mouth. I could only gaze. I sat there like a half-baked
clam and watched the whole thing happen as I knew it was going to.
You couldn't follow it in detail. It was a sudden whirlwind of
flying arms and legs and twisting bodies, and then suddenly-Bang!
Down Castro went, like a brick falling off a building, with the Jap
on top of him.</p>

<p>"I whipped round behind. Castro was lying unconscious. They took
him away to the infirmary and I followed. I pretended I was a
friend, and got to speak to the house surgeon. They examined him
and said his back was broken."</p>

<p>Tony's upper lip was twitching, and he dabbed the end of a
cigarette in an ash-tray.</p>

<p>"And there he lay for five days unconscious. The doc says he may
die any minute, or he may live for ten years. Yesterday he opened
his eyes. He seems just conscious of what's going on, but no one
can get him to talk. I got them to shunt him into a private ward,
and this morning I tried to tackle him. I thought the best game
would be to come straight to the point. I knew he was a vindictive
case, and that he had quarreled with Jim. So I said, 'Listen here,
Mr. Castro, do you want that hundred pounds you nearly won the
other night? If you do, it's yours if you'll just give me a little
information about Jim Troon.'</p>

<p>"He stared at me blankly, and up at the ceiling, and I repeated
my request several times in diverse forms. At last he said, 'We was
shipmates.' He shut his eyes as though that clinched matters. But I
was desperate. I was afraid he'd die, and perhaps he knew something
and he might save the Querrils. I repeated the request, and offered
to make it two hundred pounds. And then, by Golly! Do you know what
he did? I was holding my head near to catch his answer, and he spat
in my face, and closed his eyes again...And that's how the case
stands at present, John Capel."</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter 15&mdash;An Island
Story</h2>

<hr>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>At the end of July, Mrs. Querril came to her island. It was not
an undiscovered island in a land of dreams. It belonged as a matter
of fact to a cigar-merchant, and it was at the mouth of a Cornish
river. It was a diminutive affair, less than a quarter of a mile
long, and not more than a hundred yards wide at its widest. It
consisted principally of a large modern castellated house built on
rock, three cottages, a beach, and a strip of land covered with
coarse grass and shrubs. The biggest thing about it was the rent
demanded by the cigar-merchant for the month of August. The payment
was only justified by some one desperately in need of being cut off
from the world, and it seemed too alluring an attraction to the
Querrils to resist if it could be managed at all. Eventually a
happy arrangement was come to, by which Mr. Lemaire, Mr. Querril,
and Decimus shared the expenses each according to their family and
requirements. It was an ugly house, but commodious and very
attractive in fine weather.</p>

<p>If Peter bad been there it would have been the nearest thing to
Mrs. Querril's island dream that she could reasonably expect to
attain. Even without Peter, it presented her with many hours of
distraction and happiness. Of course there was no chance of John
coming, but Magda and the baby were of the party, and all the
Lemaires, including Cecil the schoolboy, and Decimus, and there
were several spare bedrooms, even then, in case they were needed.
The party spent most of the day bathing, eating, sailing, or
sitting on the terrace out of the wind, reading and talking.
Occasionally they sailed or rowed across to Angterroc&mdash;rather
less than a mile-which was their base of supplies, and their point
of communication with the outside world. Nothing had been heard of
Tony MacDowell since he departed for "that crazy little hamlet of
London." The family were quite concerned about him, and he had been
written to twice and invited to the island, but no answer had been
received.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has gone back to the States," suggested Mr.
Querril.</p>

<p>"He would never have gone without letting me know," replied
Magda.</p>

<p>"Do yon know anything about his people?" asked Mr. Lemaire.</p>

<p>"I do," said Magda. "He has a married brother much older than
himself. He's an engineer at Buffalo. And he has an old mother in
Michigan. You have to be a very special pal of Tony's to get him to
tell you about his mother. He has a little locket with her
portrait, which he always wears concealed inside his
waistcoat."</p>

<p>"H'm!" grunted Mr. Querril. "They're very sentimental&mdash;the
Americans&mdash;very sentimental! Charming people
but&mdash;sentimental!"</p>

<p>Ebba Janssen&mdash;who was spending a week with the family of
her fianc&mdash;looked up with a queer little smile.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said very slowly. "It is true. So different
to&mdash;the English!"</p>

<p>And nobody had any idea whether she meant it or not.</p>

<p>Mrs. Querril, who was busy on a garment for Jenny, thought to
herself:</p>

<p>"Dear me, I do hope Rodney will be happy with that girl. She has
such funny green eyes. I really can't get fond of foreigners. I do
wish he had chosen a nice simple English girl, some one like
Annette or Joan. No, not Annette, of course. Annette is promised to
my Peter. As I always say to him, 'Everything will all be the same,
darling.' It must be nearly dinner-time. I get quite hungry in this
place."</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>They were sitting on the terrace at the time. It had been a
glorious day and the sun was going down. Decimus was enjoying
himself. The embryo of a new book (in the Wedgwood Series) was
bubbling in his mind. It was to be called "The Decameron of the
Island." Ten people-instead of escaping from a plague are escaping
from a passion&mdash;come to the island, and every night they tell
their story in turn and&mdash;well, of course, the stories all
prove to be delightfully interdependent. Try as it may to do
otherwise, an island cannot escape romance. The sea has made a
frame for the little canvas. And anything which is depicted on it
must be a reflection of its own movement.</p>

<p>"Things are bound to happen on an island. They can't escape,"
thought Decimus, little dreaming of the things which were at that
moment preparing to happen on that particular island. Every one had
gone in to change for dinner except Decimus and Mr. and Mrs.
Querril.</p>

<p>Decimus was gazing idly at the sea. A dinghy about half way from
the mainland was slopping along languidly in the direction of the
island. Small boats often cruised about these waters, and
occasionally came right up to the shore and read the dilapidated
notice-board which said:</p>

<p>"Visitors are not allowed to land on the island. Private
property."</p>

<p>Sometimes this notice was respected and sometimes ignored. In
this particular case the boat appeared to be making a very
business-like course for the little beach on the south side of the
house, where the most successful landings were made.</p>

<p>Decimus remarked:</p>

<p>"Looks as though we're going to have a visitor."</p>

<p>Mr. Querril was always amusing himself with a telescope. He
turned it on the dinghy and replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't expect they're coming here. There are three people
on board...It may possibly be some of the stuff from the stores.
Radkin's, over at Angterroc, said he'd try and send it if it came
to-day."</p>

<p>The little boat became invisible, owing to the elevation from
which they were looking. In a few minutes' time, however, Evelyn
came out and said:</p>

<p>"There's some one landing on the beach. I saw them from my
bedroom. It's a man with two boatmen."</p>

<p>She walked to the end of the terrace. There was a winding stone
staircase that had been cut from the extreme edge down to the
beach. Any one coming up was not visible till he reached the last
few steps. Evelyn loitered by the entrance, and suddenly she almost
screamed:</p>

<p>"Why, it's Tony!"</p>

<p>The others were gradually collecting for dinner. The news was
shouted all over the house.</p>

<p>"It's Tony! Tony has turned up!"</p>

<p>The boys ran to their windows which overlooked the terrace and
cheered. Magda ran out through the French windows of the
drawing-room. Both Mr. and Mrs. Querril got up and walked towards
the hero of this excitement.</p>

<p>Tony MacDowell walked slowly up the last few steps of the
stairway and on to the terrace. He staggered along and held out his
hand. His face looked grayer than usual, and dark rings encircled
his eyes. He looked like a man dead beat to the world. He groped
his way towards Mrs. Querril and made a brave attempt to smile. The
group surrounded him with cries of greeting, and exclamations of
surprise. Then they seemed to all stop suddenly. There was
something queer about Tony. He looked ill. Something had happened.
He held Mrs. Querril's hand and seemed to experience a difficulty
in getting his speech. At last he said:</p>

<p>"I've brought along some big news for you."</p>

<p>They all leaned eagerly forward, but no one attempted to
question him.</p>

<p>"Peter's going to be released," he said.</p>

<p>There was an almost inaudible gasp of joy, and every one
instinctively turned to Mrs. Querril as though recognizing that
this was her show. But the mother of Peter merely lowered her
spectacles and looked above them at the messenger. Then tears
started to her eyes, and her tongue seemed to be moving noiselessly
between her lips.</p>

<p>"They've found out," Tony went on, "that the girl Emma Troon
died years ago. This girl...is not Emma Troon. Her real name is
Clara Castellani. She was nearly nineteen at the time Peter...Gee!
I'm afraid I feel a bit queer, I..."</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>It was Martin who caught Tony. Several of them carried him in
and put him down on a bed upstairs. An emergency bottle of brandy
was produced, and Mrs. Yardley got busy with her array of hot-water
bottles. But Tony was very shaky. He recovered his consciousness in
a very few minutes, but he lay there sleepily exhausted, like a man
who had done everything possible in a cause and is indifferent to
the result. It was decided not to question him further. The news he
had brought was sufficient unto itself. It was all-important,
tremendous! Peter was to be released! Peter was innocent! Peter
would come to the island! Everything would be as usual!</p>

<p>Annette ran round the terrace. She felt she must run. She ran
down the pathway at the back of the house, where she was joined by
both the dogs. They found it somewhat dull on the island with
nothing to do but to bark at seagulls&mdash;and when she
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Potash darling, Peter is free! My Peter is free and innocent!
Oh, Perlmutter, Peter is coming back!"</p>

<p>Both dogs barked with delight, and scampered at her heels. It
was apparently the most ecstatic news they had heard for many a
day. The three of them did a round of the island in a world's
record time, making a noise that could surely be heard on the
mainland a mile away. When Annette regained the house, she dashed
upstairs.</p>

<p>The only person she could see on the landing was Ebba, who had
just come out of her room.</p>

<p>"Ebba, Ebba," cried Annette. "Peter is free! Peter is going to
be released!"</p>

<p>Ebba adjusted some little ornament at her throat, and turned to
the long mirror on the staircase.</p>

<p>"Really," she said. "That's excellent! I'm very glad."</p>

<p>Annette dashed away and into the room she shared with Joan. Joan
was standing there looking flushed and pleased. Annette flung her
arms round her and kissed her. Then she threw herself on the bed,
and making strange noises that were a mixture of growls, groans and
joy, she proceeded to bite the pillow.</p>

<p>"Whatever <i>are</i> you doing, darling?" said Joan.</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" growled Annette. "How I hate that Swedish woman!"</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The family were dying for more news, but nobody would think of
disturbing Tony. He had been given a light meal and put to bed.
According to a rule of the island, every one was to go to bed at
ten o'clock. This rule was strictly adhered to by every one except
Mr. Querril who usually turned in at half past, and Decimus-who
incidentally had proposed the rule and suggested a scheme of
penalties for infringement-and he usually went to bed about twelve.
On this occasion it was nearer one in the morning that Decimus
crept upstairs. His mind had been much occupied and he had not
noticed the time. "The Decameron of the Island" was being furnished
with living episodes. "Things are bound to happen on an island.
They can't escape."</p>

<p>Decimus got quietly into bed and turned out the light. He lay
there ruminating for nearly half an hour, when he was suddenly
startled by a gentle tap on the door. He sat up in bed and heard
his door open quietly.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" he called out.</p>

<p>A voice answered:</p>

<p>"Are you awake, Dess? I'm just crazy for a talk and a
smoke!"</p>

<p>"Tony! You ought not to be talking and smoking, you ought to be
asleep!"</p>

<p>"Aw! I'm all right. I was just a bit jagged. It was more the
emotional strain of getting here than anything I'd been
through."</p>

<p>He shut the door, and Decimus lighted a candle. There was no
electric light on the island, which is only right and proper. Tony
pulled a paper packet of cigarettes out of his dressing-gown
pocket, and lighted one from the candle.</p>

<p>"I'm getting a real live-wire at this detective business," he
said. "I didn't know your room. So I tracked round till I came
across a pair of fairy-like footgear, then I took a chance. It's a
real good institution, this British institution of hanging out your
boots. It's like nailing your colors to the mast. When I go along
the corridor of a hotel and see outside a door a large pair of
man's boots and next to it a dainty pair of girl's boots, I always
get a peculiar kind of thrill. I feel I want to tap on the door and
call out: 'Say, are you comfy?'"</p>

<p>Decimus was also "crazy for a talk," but his conscience smote
him that he ought not to encourage Tony to talk. The boy was played
out. He ought to be in bed. In any case he would ask no questions.
If he insisted on talking, then he must. It was a great temptation
to listen. Why was he so played out? What experiences had he been
through?</p>

<p>Tony ensconced himself comfortably in an upholstered cane chair,
and puffed his cigarette. Decimus watched him, and noted the
twitching of his sallow face, and the movement of his restless eyes
as he blinked at the candle. Suddenly he said:</p>

<p>"I'm scared about Peter. I saw him in prison. Gosh! he is sick.
I couldn't tell them. It's fair broke him up. He's been in the
infirmary three weeks. There's a dog's chance that if they can get
him out quick his life may be saved. Two years of it would have
killed him sure. He hardly knew me. He doesn't realize that he may
come out soon."</p>

<p>Tony buried his head in his hands. Decimus was not sure that he
was not sobbing. He was silent for some moments. The steady beat of
the sea against the rocks below sounded like the distant roar of
ironic cheers at some cruel fate. The voice of Tony changed. It was
colored with passion and anger.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's cruel!" he said. "This prison system is barbaric! It's
damned...cruel. It leaves out everything we've fought for. If a man
has done wrong, you ought to help him, not break him. Why this
better distinction between physical and spiritual things? If a man
gets appendicitis you remove his appendix and nurse him up; you
don't kick him in the stomach."</p>

<p>He leaned back and surveyed his cigarette which had gone out. He
relighted it, and continued:</p>

<p>"But there's awful big things on the move, Dess...If you want to
get on in the world, it's a great scheme to adopt an attitude of
utter helplessness. Go about like an infant. Someone is dead sure
to come along, and help you through. These Querrils! How can you
help it? They tickle me to death! I love them. They're hothouse
products. They know there will always be gardeners to keep the
place at the right temperature for them. They are like Ptolemy the
Second, who gambles on his beauty. This young Capel! He's a proper
man! My! I wish you'd seen the way he handled friend Castro!"</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Decimus rolled on his bed, and reached for his own cigarette
case. He was elaborately nonchalant.</p>

<p>"You saw Castro then? If you won't offer me one of your
cigarettes, I must smoke my own!"</p>

<p>"Sorry. Yep, I saw friend Castro. He would have no truck with
any one till the other sailor-man came along. By God! I couldn't
help admiring the man. His back was broken, but he spat in my face
because I asked him to betray a man he hated. And his reason was
sufficient. They were shipmates. What is this bond of the sea? You
never hear a man speak of his landmate. The land seems to have no
honor or <i>esprit de corps</i>. It staggers you when you come up
against it.</p>

<p>"And there was Castro lying there like a dead man, spitting out
his hate at the world. And then the other man comes along and leans
over and talks to him. He doesn't seem to hear him for a long time.
He just bogles at the ceiling. And then he gradually seems to be
conscious of something, some tang of the great salt open spaces. He
blinks and turns his eyes to the other fellow. And Capel never asks
him to betray his shipmate, but he talks about rivers in Borneo,
and about old fruit steamers plying the waters of the Malay
Archipelago, and serangs, and quartermasters, and cargo-chains and
winches. And gradually the other joins in. He becomes interested.
He calls him 'tuan.' They seem to get lost in the mists of the
Southern Seas. You can smell the damn place. At last they reach the
island of Pannantonga..."</p>

<p>Tony pulled his dressing-gown round him more tightly. In spite
of the warmth of the night he seemed chilly. Decimus offered his
eiderdown, which he wasn't using, but the boy shook his head.</p>

<p>"What was I saying? Oh, yes, sure, Pannantonga. It seemed that
at that time Castro and Jim Troon were shipmates on a
freight-steamer plying between Monte Video and some of the South
Sea islands. Every spring they touched Pannantonga. It sounded a
fairy-like-enough location, covered with flowers and cocoanuts,
with coral-reefs all around. There was a long white bungalow on the
south side of the island&mdash;a dandy place, like a Long Island
summer resort&mdash;and here there lived an Italian woman named
Fiametta Castellani. She was the kept woman of one of these Malay
rajahs. He was a very wealthy man, with big interests all over the
South Seas. He used to spend about two months a year with her. The
rest of the time he was away collecting the stuff and getting a
move on his different propositions. And then of course the old Adam
and Eve triple-bill was staged. The lady got fed up with these long
intervals of nothing but reading novels and thrashing the servants.
And then there came to the island a most unlikely source of trouble
in the person of a Scotch accountant, a rawboned, sandy galoot
named Morson. He was sent there by the Rajah for a month every year
to check his dealings. He sounded like a frozen guinea, but he
seemed to get right there in the ladies' affections, without any
difficulty.' He was the only man Fiametta ever got crazy over.</p>

<p>"It's a very ordinary, sordid story, Decimus. It will make yon
blush. Not on account of the immorality, but on account of the
triteness of it. Fiametta had a baby, a dusky-eyed little effort
for which the Rajah was right and properly responsible. He was as
pleased as a man who has lost a ten-cent piece, and found a
five-dollar bill. He left a few days after the baby was born,
intending to return in a month or two. But at Singapore he
contracted fever and was very ill for a long spell. When he
recovered his affairs had got tied up, and he had to go to Europe
on a big litigation case. He was away altogether for fifteen
months. Fourteen months after he'd been away, Fiametta had another
baby. This would not have pleased papa so much. In fact he would
have been dashed annoyed. And he had a certain peculiarly efficient
and Eastern way of dealing with trouble of that sort. You see he
was absolute lord of the island. He carried revolvers around with
him, and all that sort of thing. Fiametta was his bondwoman
and&mdash;well, they don't ask lots of questions down in those
parts. Fiametta was in a panic. She went up to a bungalow in the
hill, alone with an old Italian woman and a native servant. And
there she had the baby, so that no one else on the island should
hear about it, and also because when it was born she meant to
dispose of it.</p>

<p>"But when the time came she lost her nerve. No woman can kill
her own baby unless she is actually 'temporarily insane.' And
Fiametta wasn't. When she saw it, she cried, and wanted to keep it,
along with the dusky. She was mad on it. She must have had a pretty
bad time of it up there in that bungalow in the wood, with no one
to have a heart-to-heart with except the Italian servant, Luisa.
But one day, while the matter was still <i>in lege
pendente</i>&mdash;as the lawyers say&mdash;Luisa spotted that the
coasting steamer <i>Peter Gurney</i> had come into the bay.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm piecing this all together best way I can from
what Castro said, Dess. A lot of it is very vague. The two women
must have figured it out together. Anyway Luisa went down and loped
around the jetty. The first person she struck the trail of was Jim
Troon.</p>

<p>"There's a bit of a blank here. Whether she put her proposition
to Jim right there or whether she induced him to come up to the
Castellani woman, I don't know. But the result was a square deal.
And Castro, who was at that time second mate, had to be let into
the secret. The baby was smuggled out at night on to the steamer,
and shoved into Castro's cabin. A big sum of money was paid down,
and the Castellani promised to pay a hundred pounds a year to Jim
Troon's wife to look after the baby until such time as she should
ask for it. Every year Jim or his wife was to take the child and
exhibit it to an agent in the city of London, and they would
receive a draft which would enable them to draw two pounds a
week.</p>

<p>"It's a mystery to me how Jim and Castro managed about the baby
on the voyage. Whether they pretended it was a stowaway and offered
to adopt it, or whether the skipper had a wife aboard and they got
round them both, Lord only knows!</p>

<p>"It was nearly a year before they got back to London, and they
managed to get Clara Castellani there safe and well. Jim had been
married a few months before he sailed, but his wife had so far not
presented him with offspring. But ten months after he returned she
had a child when they were living in Stockwell, which they called
Emma. Soon after they went to live at Chatham, where Jim settled
down and worked in the docks, and drew his hundred pounds a year
for the Castellani child. I gather about that time he was running
pretty straight. He was passionately fond of his wife, who was also
half-Italian&mdash;her name was Maria Ferrati&mdash;and they did
the square thing by the other woman's kid, as you might imagine
they would. And then six months later poor Jim fairly got it in the
neck. There was an epidemic of typhoid in the quarter of Chatham
where they lived. The whole family got it. They were very sick. Jim
got over it, and the Castellani child got over it, but his wife and
Emma both died."</p>

<p>"Good God!" interjected Decimus. "Then this girl is not Emma
Troon."</p>

<p>"This girl is Clara Castellani. I have seen Emma Troon's grave
in a pauper cemetery at Chatham myself."</p>

<p>"But what on earth did Troon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Troon nearly went dotty when he realized the blow he had
received. He went out after raw spirit. He bludgeoned himself into
insensibility with the poison. But he was cute enough to hang on to
the Castellani child all through. He took her to London, and
engaged odds and ends of women to look after her. He got sick of
explaining to all these people who the child was, so he eventually
just called her Emma, after his own child. But when he took her
down town to the attorney once a year she was then Clara
Castellani. And he got the stuff all right And every year for
eighteen years that woman 'way over in Pannantonga had salved her
conscience over the momentary lapse with a raw-boned Scotsman to
the tune of one hundred pounds. Jim apparently soon tired of this
wet-nurse scheme, for four years later he married a woman out of a
dry-goods store, and that's the present Mrs. Troon. I reckon he
married her more as a nurse to the child than as a companion to
himself. She seemed to fill no kink in his heart He never stopped
drinking from the day of the first Mrs. Troon's death. He never
told his wife who Clara Castellani is. She still thinks she's the
child of his first wife.</p>

<p>"Now comes the crux of the situation. Last year the money
suddenly stopped. The attorney said that the Castellani woman was
dead, but Jim didn't believe him. It synchronized with a moment
when Castro again turned up in London. The men were both hard up,
as usual. Troon was furious with the Querrils over some imaginary
grievance. He and Castro got together. And then&mdash;I gather this
scheme-this blackmailing, dirty plot was evolved by the two of
them."</p>

<p>"It's what you call 'the honor of the sea,'" remarked
Decimus.</p>

<p>"That's one of the side miracles&mdash;that men, who could be
loyal to each other, could put across anything as diabolically
vile. For the whole thing was done in a cold-blooded, commercial
way. They spotted that these Querrils were&mdash;amateurs. They put
Emma&mdash;I mean Clara&mdash;on to it. She was partly innocent and
partly guilty. Anyway she was young, but not so young as they
represented. They drove her into it very neatly. In the end she
scored off them by disappearing."</p>

<p>Tony stopped and his head drooped on to his chest. Decimus was
not watching him. He was turning it all over in his mind.</p>

<p>"There are lots of points I'd like to ask you about," he said at
length.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, but not to-night. I'm through." Tony stood up and
staggered towards the window. He hovered there for a moment like a
great ghost, then he added:</p>

<p>"Besides it's all going to seem trivial now."</p>

<p>Decimus waited for further enlightenment, and none being
forthcoming, he remarked:</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'it's all going to seem trivial now'?"</p>

<p>Tony turned to him as though somewhat surprised.</p>

<p>"Haven't you been reading the news-sheets?"</p>

<p>"Curiously enough Querril forgot to order the papers, and we can
never get them over at Angterroc. In fact it's rather nice to get
away from all the hot air of Fleet Street for a bit. We We enjoyed
it. We haven't seen a paper for five days. Has anything been
happening?"</p>

<p>Tony hesitated by the door. He seemed anxious to frame his
parting news in an effective manner. He walked across the room
again and blew out the candle.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I'm disturbing like this," he said. "Little boys
ought to have gone by-by long since. I tell you they're
wonderful&mdash;these Querrils. Folks are bound to be always
looking after them. And it's quite right they should. They're the
darlings of the gods. I just love them, the whole atmosphere of
them. We've got to preserve them somehow. John has done his
service. You can always depend on some one like John turning up to
defend them, although they would never quite understand him, never
quite appreciate him. And now John has gone off to help see them
through again."</p>

<p>"Where's he gone?"</p>

<p>"This island fleet has been mobilized. John's away seeking his
lawful occasions. In a few days' time the whole of Europe will be
at war."</p>

<p>It was Tony's <i>ultima thule</i>. He whispered, "Good night,
Dess," and disappeared silently through the door.</p>

<p>Decimus lay there some time, watching the dark corner of the
room where Tony had vanished. He seemed to be doubting whether the
door had ever opened and shut, whether indeed the visit of his
friend had not been a chimera, an island night's dream. Then he
rose heavily and puffed his way to the window.</p>

<p>The night was calm and extraordinarily placid. There was no
moon, but the profundity of the heavens was disclosed by the stars
in an almost incredible scheme of gradations&mdash;Some bold and
interrogative, others idle and detached; while here and there a
pale swarm would melt into nothingness, as though they were leaving
it all; floating away like the hejira of a flock of acolytes
dismissed from their job by the high priest for some lack of
punctilio in the impressive ceremonial.</p>

<p>"It's wonderfully balanced," thought Decimus suddenly.</p>

<p>All around was the mysterious movement of water. Beneath him a
dart: rock stood out like some cowled Aesculapius listening to the
pulse of the sea.</p>

<p>Away in the distance lights flickered hither and thither, like
furtive eyes suspicious of this immensity of repose.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>Chapter 16&mdash;The Idealist
Versus the Philosopher</h2>

<hr>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Peter spent five months in a nursing home in London. For part of
that time he hovered between life and death. At one time it was
doubtful whether he would in any case retain his reason. That he
would be an invalid for several years was a foregone conclusion.
The prison experience had shattered his nerves, affected his heart,
and seriously disorganized his digestive apparatus. He was to all
intents and purposes a physical wreck.</p>

<p>It was not till the following February that he was well enough
to be removed in a motor ambulance to Chessilton Heath&mdash;"the
chunk of a growing boy," who had raced off one morning to catch his
train to London, returned, looking like a wizened old gentleman. He
had suffered from jaundice, and his skin was wrinkled and yellow.
He started at the slightest noise. He hardly ever spoke or smiled.
He lay all day staring at the ceiling, as though he didn't
recognize where he was, or that it didn't interest him. The family
in turns came and sat by his bed, and tried to amuse him. He seemed
to take an inordinately long time to take anything in, and when he
did he merely nodded or frowned. It didn't seem to matter. Some of
them read to him, and he would listen abstractedly for a few
minutes, and then fall asleep, or be obviously distressed.</p>

<p>He developed unaccountable likes and dislikes to people, and an
almost savage fastidiousness concerning food. If it wasn't exactly
as he fancied it, he would thrust it from him like a spoiled child.
His mother worried him, and the boys left him quite apathetic. He
would sometimes like to have Magda, and he would clutch her hand
and fumble with it like a drowning man. Once they brought the baby,
and held it up to him. He looked at it solemnly for half a minute,
and then suddenly burst into tears and turned on his side. He did
not appear to recognize either Tony or Decimus. The only person
with whom he seemed entirely comfortable was his nurse, a
middle-aged, competent person from Lancashire named Morson. She
treated him kindly, but with unrelenting firmness. She would
say:</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Master Peter; we won't have any of that. Fish! Very
nice fish, very good for little boy. Fish very good for the
brain&mdash;make master a very clever big man. Now coom on,
laddy!"</p>

<p>And Peter seemed to recognize in her the arbitrary embodiment of
some autocratic power that might possibly get him out of all this
mess. He grumbled and protested, but he always did as she told him
in the long run.</p>

<p>When Annette came to see him, he appeared startled, as though
she had suddenly touched some chord of revelation within himself.
He looked at her very hard. She leaned over him and said:</p>

<p>"Peter, you know me. You know me, don't you,
Peter?...Annette!"</p>

<p>He looked from her face to the window, as though he were trying
to recall some pleasant experience, which for the moment eluded
him. She kissed him on the brow, and he put up his hands, and
fondled her hair.</p>

<p>Annette smiled, and chatted on in her musical voice:</p>

<p>"Peter, do you remember when you lost your cap in the rabbit
holes upon Folly's Head? And when we picnicked over in the woods at
Moblehurst and you made up the story about Gobbo the white
rhinoceros and Ug the giraffe. And it came on to rain, Peter, and
we took cover in a sand-pit, and there we met the funny old man who
showed us tricks with string, and said he had been a quartermaster
on a sloop which had sunk pirate Chinese dhows. And how excited you
were! and you wanted to go to sea; and you practised harpooning on
the lawn, and smashed a tomato frame. Peter, Peter dear, do you
remember the old lady in the cottage at Tidehurst, who told us how
'profligate' her potatoes had been?..."</p>

<p>Peter looked at her, vaguely entertained. He still played with
her hair. And then suddenly he said in a faint voice:</p>

<p>"There was a zigzag path down to the shore. You..."</p>

<p>"Yes? Yes, Peter, yes?"</p>

<p>Annette plainly strived to think of the particular experience he
was trying to recall, but she could not. After a moment or two, he
sighed and turned away.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>It would be unfair to the Querril family to imagine that the
serious condition of Peter absorbed the whole family attention
during that trying period, or that they were in any way indifferent
to "the bigger issue" which was then engulfing the world. The war,
in fact, led to most unusual Querrilian celebrations. At times in
discussing it, the family were as near to quarreling as they had
ever been in their lives. It was a matter that if thought about at
all had to be thought about intensely.</p>

<p>Decimus always retained one very definite little vision of an
island episode.</p>

<p>It was the night the news came. They were all on the terrace.
Rodney and Magda had just landed from the boat. They were armed
with newspapers, and were looking very white and solemn. Martin had
called out:</p>

<p>"Is it true?"</p>

<p>And Magda had nodded her head, and replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir Edward Grey has made a disgusting, patriotic speech.
They're at war..."</p>

<p>And Decimus became extremely occupied with this new aspect of
Querrilism, which adjudged patriotism "disgusting." It was not an
opinion in any way influenced by the obvious danger in which John
was immediately plunged. It was something much deeper and more
final than that. It was an expression of revolt of the finer
sensibilities against the course fiber of the body politic. During
the whole of their lives they had never given the question of war
ten minutes' consideration. War was not merely a crime, it was an
unspeakable, unthinkable crime. And patriotism, with its narrow
partizanship, and unaltruistic outlook, was&mdash;disgusting!
Everything that had been striven for and established was thrown
into a melting pot. Conscience was outraged. These old gentlemen,
who held the lives of every one in their hands, ought to have
avoided it. The matter was not agreeable.</p>

<p>It may be said that that was the first conclusion arrived at by
the whole of the Querril family. And it was a conclusion fanned to
a white heat by the hygienist, Ebba Janssen.</p>

<p>Ebba Janssen for the first time showed real animation and
enthusiasm. She talked till late that night about "the capitalist
war."</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>This universal, outraged sense lasted many months. Mr. Querril
would sometimes say:</p>

<p>"Dear me, they ought not to have invaded Belgium!" or, "This
seems very shocking, a passenger ship torpedoed!"</p>

<p>But the protest was said rather in sorrow than in anger. It was
an impeachment of times rather than of individuals. It could never
have happened if Mr. Gladstone had been alive, or even King Edward.
It was a very long time before the Querril family would begin to
realize that the war was in any way an affair which concerned
themselves directly. It certainly concerned John, but John was an
exceptional person, a professional naval man. If John thought it
was all right to go about killing people for some vague principle,
then, as far as he was concerned, it was all right. And the point
must be loyally conceded for the sake of Magda.</p>

<p>Curiously enough the most doubtful member was Rodney. He adhered
to the Querril point of view, generally speaking, but he appeared
to be weighing the whole thing in his mind, and he would sometimes
advance theories that sounded almost imperialist.</p>

<p>Mr. Lemaire was also hot on the popular side, and Annette
frequently argued that "as things were, we were bound to come in."
There were so many other of their friends who held this view that
gradually it became understood that discussion of the war was
taboo.</p>

<p>To Decimus the question was fraught with such amazingly
discursive possibilities that no one could determine what he
thought. With a pacifist he would take up the attitude of a rabid
imperialist; with a red-hot patriot he would argue by the hour as a
pacifist.</p>

<p>Peter had never heard of the war. It began when he was
practically out of his mind in the prison infirmary, and he was
still too unwell to read the newspapers. And of course it was
agreed that nothing should be said to him about it.</p>

<p>In the spring he was brought downstairs, and the library was
converted into his bedroom. On fine days Nurse Morson would wheel
him out onto the brick path of the pergola and leave him there in
the sun.</p>

<p>And there he was on a certain day in May when Rodney was married
to Ebba.</p>

<p>There were certain disappointments about this wedding. In the
first place Ebba refused to be married in a church. She said that
as neither of them believed in the church service it would be a
profanity to go through it. She also said that she did not consider
that the feelings of one's relatives ought to influence one's sense
of duty. Conscience was above everything, so they went to the
registrar's office. In the second place she refused to cry.</p>

<p>But the third and greatest disappointment-certainly to Mrs.
Querril&mdash;was that the young couple were not to live at
Chessilton Heath. It appeared that Ebba required a quicker train
service, in order to be in closer touch with her multifarious
activities, so they went to live at Clotton-Diddlesbury, about half
way up the line, where there were good trains that got to London in
half an hour. After the wedding, and when the few guests had
departed, Peter, who was just going to be wheeled in, suddenly said
to Evelyn:</p>

<p>"Where was John?"</p>

<p>"John! Oh, he couldn't get leave, darling."</p>

<p>Peter said nothing more, but he seemed to be considering the
matter profoundly.</p>

<p>The next morning he asked for John again. Evelyn again reminded
him of what she had said. In the afternoon he said to Magda:</p>

<p>"It's a long time since John had leave, Magda."</p>

<p>Magda concealed her surprise at the remark.</p>

<p>"No, darling, only a month or two ago. I think he's on
manoeuvers or something."</p>

<p>Poor Magda! How she wished she were speaking the truth!</p>

<p>A few days later he said to Nurse Morson:</p>

<p>"Nurse, find out for me where John Capel is."</p>

<p>"Aye now, laddy, don't you worry yourself. Mr. Capel's all
right."</p>

<p>He looked at her suspiciously. John was becoming an obsession.
With the cunning of an invalid he began to try and trip people up
over the question of John. He suspected that something was being
kept from him. In a most unaccountable fashion the quest of John
seemed to vitalize him. It was the first matter he had developed an
interest in since he was a free man. He seemed to think it was in
some way tremendously important. A slight tinge of color came to
his cheeks, his eyes became brighter. Nearly every day he said:</p>

<p>"Has nothing been heard of John to-day?"</p>

<p>"This John is doing the boy a power of good," said the nurse one
day to Mrs. Querril.</p>

<p>Several specialists and pathologists had visited Peter and
recommended various forms of treatment, but no one seemed to do him
so much good as this elusive lieutenant whose address even to his
own wife was never more informing than "Somewhere at sea."</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>With increasing vitality the truth could not be kept from him
for long. One day he asked for a newspaper. The request was
received with mingled delight and regret. Peter was beginning to
take an interest in his fellow men. Alas! for his first glimpse at
his fellow man's recent activities! Nurse Morson equivocated. She
would get the newspaper later on. She consulted the family. It was
eventually decided that it would be better for some one to tell him
about the war, before he was brought face to face with all its
complicated and distressing details in the daily press. It was a
Friday, and Magda remembered that Tony was coming down the next day
for the week-end. Who could be better at breaking the news
cunningly and felicitously than he? And this was Tony's felicitous
method as he imparted the information to Peter in a sunny corner of
the lawn:</p>

<p>"Say, sonny, while you've been playing the sick man, there's
been a real good rumpus all over this gay little earth. The big
powers have picked up sides, and they're not all in the game yet.
They're having a real good time. This little old island, France,
and Russia top the bill this side, and Germany and Austria are star
performers over yonder. And they've all got their fans out in the
Balkans, trying to beat up some fresh keen ball-players. The United
States has not yet taken a hand in it, but Tony MacD. is trying for
all he's worth to wangle a passport to New York, and if ever he
gets to Washington the President and all that push will have to
show him a pretty cute reason why God's country is not living up to
its story. We all have a story. It's what we've come through, what
we are, what we represent. And we have to go on with it, or close
the book forever."</p>

<p>Peter never took his eyes from the cherry blossom in full flower
against the house. At this point he said:</p>

<p>"Why are they at war?"</p>

<p>Tony did not hesitate with his answer.</p>

<p>"Because the story has reached that point where the war comes
in. In a hundred years' time some genius will sift the causes which
brought it about; and no one will bother to read him, because they
will have their own troubles then. But I could put him wise now.
It's come through greed, vanity, selfishness, ignorance,
intolerance, love, honor, and fear. In fact all the ingredients of
a real good story. But mostly love and fear. We all want things for
those we love, and we're fearful for those we love. A nest like
this...if you thought there was a gang of thieves and galoots up on
Folly's Head whose big idea was to raid this place and carry off
your women-folk&mdash;what would you do? You'd employ the
instruments of fear. If you were going bankrupt, and the place was
to be sold off, and you saw a chance to do a big deal, and make it
safe again, so as your women-folk should go softly and wear their
glad-rags again&mdash;wouldn't you do it? And if you make money
some one gets pushed back a bit. It's all in the story. And the
motif of the story&mdash;the only motif of any story.&mdash;is
love.</p>

<p>"Fear is only an accessory after the fact. And, sir, it's not
this gauzy, universal brotherhood-of-man, grape-juice and potash
brand of love that counts. It's the intense, individual love. The
eyes of some woman, the touch of her hand, the lingering,
compelling essence of her, that hallows her children and yours.
It's that that links you to life. It's that that makes you do
things, fool around, and go to war because you're frightened. It's
your story, and the story of the gay little earth."</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Tony wangled his passport. He told Mrs. Querril he was going to
see his old mother in Michigan. But to Magda he had quite a
different reason for going. He said:</p>

<p>"The fact is, I want a good eat. An American who has been abroad
some time gets a sort of nostalgia for green corn on the cob."</p>

<p>"You sensualist! You could get some sent over."</p>

<p>"It's not the same. Besides, there's all sorts of other good
things, and the cooking!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure Mrs. Yardley is a very good cook."</p>

<p>"She's not bad for an English cook, but my! I crave for a
chicken  la Maryland in the way our old colored woman used to fry
it And oysters! I wake up in the night and think of the fried
oysters she used to give us, Blue-points as big as a plate!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Tony MacD. I'd no idea you were like this. We would never
have asked you down."</p>

<p>"And the breakfast! Breakfast is a dead meal this side. You
don't begin to understand cereals. And these boiled eggs in a
little hourglass, gosh! The cooking of hen-fruit is an art in
itself. And where is the grape-fruit of my youth? and the steaming
plates of buckwheat cake, and dear, gold maple syrup?"</p>

<p>"Do you have all this for breakfast?"</p>

<p>"We diaper it all round our central edifice, which is usually a
grilled chop, and a dish of fried potatoes."</p>

<p>"You horror! No wonder you are miserable here. We must have
simply starved you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm just starved," sighed Tony, not taking his eyes from
the fine curves of Magda's cheek and neck, as she bent over the
baby.</p>

<p>And so he went back to America, and ate green corn on the cob,
and saw his old mother in Michigan, and ultimately persuaded the
United States to come into the war.</p>

<hr>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>When Tony had gone, Peter was allowed to have the newspapers. At
first they simply bewildered him. He read a little, and then
frowned and pushed the paper away.</p>

<p>He said nothing, but for days he was so obviously troubled that
the nurse persuaded him to forego reading. She read little bits out
to him instead.</p>

<p>At the end of the next week he asked for the paper again. He
became so insistent that they thought he would be probably
unhappier still without it. This time he sighed and seemed
determined to go into the matter more exhaustively. He read for a
long time and afterwards was more tranquil.</p>

<p>As the weeks went by he became more avid for news. He not only
read the daily papers, but demanded the weeklies and the
quarterlies. As his interest increased, his vitality renewed itself
in like ratio. Before the end of the month he was walking by easy
stages about the garden and a little way down the road. He became a
voracious reader. He read everything he could get hold of,
including novels and books on various aspect of the war. They
brought him his sketch book and pencil, but the passion for drawing
seemed dormant. He Wanted to read and he couldn't read enough.</p>

<p>And then one day there was a great excitement. John turned up.
He had three days' leave, the first since that fateful August. He
looked remarkably well, keener and more alert than ever, in spite
of the fact that the hair on his temples was beginning to turn
gray, and the crow's feet around his eyes were more pronounced. He
was in tremendously high spirits, but not a word could be got out
of him about the war or about his own activities. He wanted to
laugh and sing and rag, and throw the baby up in the air, and
brazenly hug his wife before every one, and jump the tennis
net&mdash;the others still occasionally played&mdash;and run Peter
down to the heath and back in his wheeled chair. His visit came and
went in a flash. It was like a tonic to a jaded body. It left
behind it the aftermath of cheerfulness and hope, only marred by
that haunting but bravely controlled look at the back of Magda's
eyes.</p>

<p>It contrasted strangely with the visit of Rodney and Ebba, the
following week-end. They had now been married nearly three months,
and there was that curious telepathic conviction throughout the
family&mdash;mutually recognized but not expressed&mdash;that
Rodney was already not happy. Rodney, the idealist, the Querril of
Querrils, had made a mistake. And if he had made a mistake, if he
had married the wrong woman, everything that constituted a Querril
ideal was scattered to the winds. He was in far worse case than
Peter. Peter would in time recover. He would be just himself again.
But to be harnessed for life to a shattered ideal! To perhaps
become cynical. Never to have all those little niches and shrines
tucked away in one's life that meant so much.</p>

<p>And there happened on the Sunday evening a strange event in the
story of the family. Not a quarrel, but a sudden definite
disagreement between two members of it. And the two most unlikely
members: Rodney, the idealist, and Peter, the philosopher, suddenly
come to life.</p>

<hr>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>It happened in the garden. Rodney and Ebba were talking about
their work. They both belonged to a pacifist organization. Ebba was
red hot, and Rodney came along in a slower but more considered
partizanship. They talked at great length, and Martin, Magda, and
Evelyn chipped in sympathetically. Mr. Querril occasionally
intercepted mildly with the "but-we-must-be-practical" standpoint.
Suddenly the invalid from the chair said:</p>

<p>"I think what you're doing is all rot!"</p>

<p>The bombshell was received with an explosion of laughter. Peter
was well! Peter was himself again! That was the dominant feeling,
but Rodney smiled indulgently, and Ebba superciliously.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is," said Rodney. "But still we think it's
right."</p>

<p>"Peter has returned to find himself a patriot," laughed
Martin.</p>

<p>Ebba spoke up in her precise tones:</p>

<p>"No doubt he will be joining up, and going out to fight for the
rich Jews of Throgmorton Street."</p>

<p>And then Peter made a most surprising statement. He said:</p>

<p>"If I were well enough I'd join to-morrow!"</p>

<p>This statement was received with far more amazement than his
first. It was said sincerely, indeed almost tearfully. It was like
a sudden uncomfortable realization that there were two Querril
points of view, and they were hopelessly at variance. It had about
it, too, the sinister hint of some overpowering actuality. It
brought the horror of the day right into that nest on the Surrey
heath. It was the first intimation that the war was a thing which
actually concerned the Querril inner life. If Peter was so
obviously sincere about himself, it implied that he certainly
thought that Martin and Rodney were wrong.</p>

<p>Mrs. Querril looked at her youngest son, and for the first time
drew comfort from his sallow face and hollow cheeks. Peter would
never be well enough to go to any war.</p>

<p>"Dear me, he's very easily excited since his fever," thought
Mrs. Querril.</p>

<p>Rodney soon had himself in hand.</p>

<p>"Well, let us hear what Pedro has got to say," he remarked.</p>

<p>The tears were almost starting from Peter's eyes. He
spluttered:</p>

<p>"I can't talk about it. It's too tremendous. It's all part
of...what I learned in prison. I see things differently. Life is
such a big thing. It isn't all as simple as you make out. Everybody
isn't just&mdash;like us."</p>

<p>"What is he talking about?" asked Ebba.</p>

<p>"Let Peter say what he wants to," snapped Evelyn.</p>

<p>"You've been an interferer, Rodney, all your time. You believed
in interference in matters of social reform. You still believe in
it. Where are you going to draw the line? AH nations are now
interdependent. Nobody's going to shut themselves off and say 'This
is our country. We're going to make human sacrifices, indulge in
unnatural vices, borrow and not pay back, do just what we like and
it's nothing to do with you.' If they do that, they've got to be
interfered with. There's growing up not merely a herd instinct, but
a world instinct. An uncontrollable desire to have things decently
and universally ordered. People are wretched&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, my dear chap, how on earth does a war help matters? It
makes it worse. It puts everything back hundreds of years."</p>

<p>"Germany's triumph for world dominion would put everything back
a hundred years. If they are broken, social reform&mdash;socialism,
if you like&mdash;will leap into its own at a bound. The world will
get together. This stupid movement of yours is helping no one. It
can't possibly stop the war. It's-' simply helping the enemy. It's
just as though you came across your dearest friend in a death grip
with an enemy and you tried to put his collar straight..."</p>

<p>Peter was very flushed, and Nurse Morson had something to say,
but it didn't concern world politics. Peter was led into the
house.</p>

<p>"He doesn't begin to understand our point of view," remarked
Ebba when he'd gone.</p>

<p>"Well, don't let's talk any more about it," said Magda.</p>

<p>And there the matter, as far as words were concerned, dropped.
But the mental impression remained indelible. It produced an
indefinable, nervy tension. Every one had to be careful what they
said, and think well beforehand. There were raw edges easily
irritated. Rodney perhaps was the most disturbed. He hated the idea
of disagreeing with Peter, and he was equally as anxious to get to
the root of the matter. It was further complicated by their many
friends, most of whom were doing war work, and a number of boys who
only last summer were playing tennis on their court were now in the
trenches, and many would never play again.</p>

<p>The Lemaires also took the popular side. Madame Lemaire was a
Frenchwoman, and her attitude was as uncompromisingly French as it
could be. Annette and Joan wavered for a time, and then Joan went
off and did canteen work, and Annette, who had learned to drive her
father's car, volunteered for the army transport service. She was
passed and sent to France, where she remained till the end of the
war.</p>

<p>And one day at breakfast Mr. Querril spluttered with a great
excitement when he opened his newspaper. Young Stallard, the boy
who stole, who could do nothing right, and of whom they had lost
trace&mdash;had won a Victoria Cross at Gallipoli!</p>

<p>One could argue about politics, but the Homeric note was
disturbing. In a world of sacrifice and suffering was the altruist
to contribute nothing? And the note was insistent among the most
unlikely people.</p>

<p>When the warrant was issued for the arrest of Jim Troon on a
charge of perjury, he was nowhere to be found. Later it was learned
that he was serving on a patrol boat. He had volunteered the day
after war was declared. It was Decimus who heard the story of his
death from the wife of a naval officer, who had survived a breezy
and unreported little incident somewhere off the coast of Ireland.
The patrol boat and the submarine had both been sunk. Jim Troon had
last been seen in a death-grip with a German officer on the bow of
the sinking boat. And so he died for the honor of the only mistress
who had held his respect throughout life.</p>

<p>It was all very disturbing!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter 17&mdash;"There Is No
Answer"</h2>

<hr>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>When, in the winter of 1917, Rodney went out to the Great War,
his departure revealed the Querril family at their best. The
reasons which ultimately prompted him to forego the nimbus of a
conscientious objector in favor of the uniform of a lieutenant in
the Royal Field Artillery were so involved as to baffle dissection.
He quarreled with his wife over the matter. At least if he did not
quarrel, their arguments, drawn out over a period of twelve months,
reached an <i>impasse</i>. Rodney would always ultimately arrive at
the same conclusion:</p>

<p>"This is all very well, my dear, but what is going to
<i>happen?</i> It is certainly established that it was they who
started it. It was <i>they</i> who would not listen. It was
<i>they</i> who were prepared. Their very success proves their
blood-guiltiness. And it is also perfectly certain that if they win
they will hold Europe in thrall. Do you think our people will sit
down under that? Do you think the French will? Do you think the
Americans will keep outside the ring and see it happen? It means
more. wars in years to come. If we win, there is a chance&mdash;not
a certainty, but a good chance&mdash;that we may get a world
understanding."</p>

<p>"It is simply the struggle for the superimposition of one set of
imperial ideas upon another."</p>

<p>"Possibly so. But the imperial ideas of Britain, France, and
America might lead to a human commonwealth. The imperial ideas of
Germany never could by any stretch of the imagination. Their ideas
are about as idealistic as the ideas of Ptolemy the Second. Wilson
is a different story. If he could have his way..."</p>

<p>It must be said for Ebba that when she found that Rodney had
made up his mind, she took it very well. She still argued, but
without bitterness. She even entered into all his arrangements when
he joined up. She showed her practical sense on more than one
occasion when he was on his training. She selected his
underclothes, and sent him parcels regularly.</p>

<p>While he was still at the Cadet School at Cambridge, their child
was born. She had not forewarned him that it might come so soon, as
she did not want him to be worried. It came, a fragile mite,
blinking at the brightness of this surprising world; it gurgled a
little, cried a little, flickered for ten long days, and then went
out.</p>

<p>Rodney came posthaste. He was terribly upset. He looked at the
little pale bud, which had opened a petal and peeped at the portals
of life, and had then declined the journey through their entrance.
He kissed the smooth crown, and felt somehow responsible. So
meaningless! So utterly futile and inexplicable!</p>

<p>He knelt down and kissed his wife, and all he could think to say
was:</p>

<p>"Ebba...Ebba...I'm so sorry. God help you to bear it."</p>

<p>He felt her thrill against him for a moment. Her face was pale
but she did not cry.</p>

<p>He wanted to telegraph for his mother, but Ebba said:</p>

<p>"If you please, I think it better not."</p>

<p>He had to return that night, and Ebba made all the arrangements
for the notification and for the funeral. She bore it all
alone.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Peter went before three medical boards and they all rejected
him. He was not even passed for clerical work. On the evening when
he returned, disconsolate from his third rejection, the mind of Mr.
Querril was exercised in the following manner:</p>

<p>"Now this is a curious fact. If it hadn't been for
this...deplorable episode, Peter would now be quite fit. He might
already be in the trenches. He might by now have been...But the
doctors agree that he will eventually get all right. Delicate
perhaps, but quite reasonably well. It may almost be said that Emma
Troon may have saved his life. How delicately interwoven are these
little skeins of fate! Just the idle balance of some caprice, and
not only a life but the lives of unborn generations are
affected."</p>

<p>Peter then took the matter into his own hands. He went up to
town and offered his services to the Prisoners of War Relief
Committee, and was absorbed into the activities of that
society.</p>

<p>Martin also compromised with his conscience. He did nothing till
the day of conscription had dawned. Then he equivocated, left it
too late to get a commission, volunteered as a private a week
before he would have been called, got passed in Medical Category C
II, and, being a clever architect and mathematician, was sent to an
obscure spot in Yorkshire and made to load clinkers on to a motor
lorry, convey them to a military base, and unload them. He did this
without variation for two years.</p>

<p>The Querril household gradually went to pieces. Magda moved up
to her flat in Chelsea, and the happy arrangement was made that
Peter stayed with her, as he was now always in town. (The fatal
Pig-sty of course had been given up years ago. )</p>

<p>Evelyn also became restless. She wanted to follow her friends
into their war-tainted operations, but she was persuaded by Magda
that "somebody really must stop with the darlings."</p>

<p>Annette was in France, Joan was away doing canteen work, whilst
Cecil, who was just an awkward, leggy schoolboy on the island, was
now an officer in Mesopotamia in charge of a company of
solemn-looking Sikhs, each one of whom might have been a
headmaster, and Cecil prefect on a week's probation.</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>On the day before Rodney went to France he went to Chessilton
Heath with his wife to say good-by. It was a Sunday, and Magda and
Peter were down for the week-end. Martin was the only member of the
family who could not be there, but Decimus came in in the
afternoon, and also Mr. and Mrs. Lemaire.</p>

<p>It was a day conducted on even more usual lines than the day of
Magda's wedding. A fine December rain was falling, and they sat
round the fire in Peter's studio, and played with Jenny and the
dogs. Mrs. Querril talked about the extraordinary difficulties of
getting marmalade, and the outrageous prices that laundries were
charging for their work. Mr. Querril became eloquent about an
illustrated book on "the Quatrocento," recently published in
Edinburgh. Decimus read out some typewritten sonnets he had got
hold of. They were for private circulation only. They were
extremely witty and were ascribed to Max Beerbohm, although Decimus
was not entirely convinced about the authorship. One which
concerned certain august personages elicited roars of laughter.
Peter read out a letter from Tony MacDowell, which also added to
the merriment. Poor Tony had also been turned down as a soldier by
the United States military authorities, and instead had been put
into an army clothing department as a clerk! and he was furious
about it! It wasn't at all what he meant. He had meant to go over,
see his old mother in Michigan, eat green corn on the cob, and just
boost the United States into the war, and then perhaps take charge
of an army corps, or become Director of Naval Construction. Instead
of that he was checking packets of trouser buttons. The war
produced many of these anomalies.</p>

<p>When it became time for Rodney to go, the posture of nonchalance
was carried off magnificently. Mr. Querril made a great to-do about
comparing the watches and clocks. He said:</p>

<p>"You've got plenty of time for your train. Don't hurry. Don't
forget that they always leave the signals down on Sundays on this
line, so if you see them down you don't have to rush. Eh? yes, that
clock's seven minutes fast by the station time. I put my watch
right by it yesterday. I don't think Mother and I will walk over
to-night&mdash;bit wet under foot&mdash;can't see where you're
stepping in the dark. Lie down Potash! You won't forget to call at
Cox's in the morning about that draft? You'll have plenty of time.
Hope you'll have better weather when you-on your next leave.
Er&mdash;good-by, my boy!"</p>

<p>There was something fine about the way Rodney took his father's
hand, the old twinkle coming into his eye as he said:</p>

<p>"Well, good-by, George! I'd like to see any press-cuttings about
that Quatrocento book."</p>

<p>Mrs. Querril kissed him and said bravely:</p>

<p>"Good-by, my darling. Write when you can."</p>

<p>Magda smiled and held him in a long hug.</p>

<p>"Good-by, old Roddies; come back quite soon."</p>

<p>Ebba, Peter, and Evelyn walked to the station with him, and the
only apparently down-cast member of the party was Ebba, silent and
white to the lips.</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>From that Sunday when Rodney came to say good-by to that fatal
day when a telegram came to Ebba to express His Majesty's regret
that he had been killed in action seemed a very brief flash of
time. It was in fact the following March, at the beginning of the
last great German offensive. Ebba's telegram simply said:</p>

<p>"Rodney killed coming to-night, Ebba."</p>

<p>It was Evelyn who opened the telegram. She was alone in the
house with her father and mother. She said to the telegraph
girl:</p>

<p>"There is no answer."</p>

<p>There certainly was not. There was nothing to be said at all.
Nothing, nothing, nothing. Only to race to her bedroom and throw
herself on the bed. Oh! why wasn't Magda here! That was her first
wild instinct. She dared not face this new and awful calamity
alone. She dared not think of it, only how to cope with the dire
problem of breaking it to the others!...That was the point to
concentrate on. She must think and think only of "the darlings."
They were sitting there now in the room beneath her, her father
reading "The Nation," and her mother knitting woollen socks for
Rodney! And Rodney was dead...dead...dead. Rodney would never come
back again. They would never see him smile again, never hear that
calm, smooth voice. They would probably never know just how he
died. Somewhere alone, out in the darkness...</p>

<p>It wouldn't do. Evelyn mustn't think like that. She must pull
herself together. She had got to tell them. She didn't know it, but
the tears were streaming down her cheeks. She groped her way down
the well-lighted staircase, and entered the drawing-room. Her
father looked up and blinked above the shaded reading lamp.</p>

<p>"Was that the post, dear?" he asked.</p>

<p>Evelyn held the telegram in her hand. She was utterly unnerved,
unprepared. She suddenly threw herself forward and buried her face
in her mother's lap.</p>

<p>"Ebba is coming..." She sobbed and thrust the telegram towards
her father.</p>

<p>Mr. Querril coughed, and stuttered, and readjusted his
glasses.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;what is&mdash;er&mdash;let me see&mdash;"</p>

<p>He read the telegram. He read it through twice, his lips
twitching in a silent articulation of the words. Then he put it
down, and said very quietly:</p>

<p>"Rodney is killed, dear."</p>

<p>Mrs. Querril had undoubtedly divined the tragic import. She sunk
back in her chair, and the tears started to her eyes, but she said
nothing. Evelyn hugged her for a long time and she felt her
mother's heart beating very rapidly. After a silence which nothing
could fill, Mrs. Querril said:</p>

<p>"Does Ebba say what time she's coming, darling?"</p>

<p>Immediate distraction for Mr. Querril. Timetables to be
consulted, and all the watches and clocks compared. Yes, Ebba would
probably arrive about 8.45. They would telephone to Jebley to meet
her with his Victoria. Should they telephone to Magda and Peter?
No, no, writing was better in such a case. Write to them Mid write
to Martin. Or wire to Magda to come down first thing in the
morning. Magda was splendid in times of trouble.</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Mrs. Querril was put to bed before Ebba arrived. Her heart was
not quite what it was. Palpitations and faintness. Ring up Dr. Fox,
also old Decimus. Nice to have old friends around one...</p>

<p>Decimus came first, hurried and solemn. He shook Mr. Querril's
hand, and kissed Evelyn. Then he sat ponderously down by the fire,
and read the telegram through twenty or thirty times, as though
hoping to discover by the lantern of Diogenes the solution of this
cruel attack upon the happiness of those he loved.</p>

<p>And then came Ebba, no longer the reformer, I the hygienist, the
arbiter of the moral conscience of mankind, but just a woman who
has lost everything. Her cheeks were colorless, the pupils of her
eyes distended, her clothes thrown on anyhow. She looked like a
woman who has just escaped from prison, or like one who is trying
to; escape from some unbearable conditions.</p>

<p>She sank into a chair and groaned. Evelyn kissed her, and cried,
and tried her best to make comforting remarks, but she sat there
quite unresponsive and stared at the fire.</p>

<p>The essayist in the corner found himself thinking:</p>

<p>"Now this is quite surprising. I'd no idea it was like this. It
was evidently only Rodney who made the mistake. And she never
suspected. Rodney must have been a fine chap. He would have seen it
through to the end. I suppose people must sometimes live their
whole lives like that, live a white lie to the bitter end."</p>

<p>It was nearly half an hour later that the mood of Ebba changed.
She cried and then suddenly began to talk, bitterly, passionately,
almost incoherently:</p>

<p>"It would not have been so bad if he had really believed in it
all&mdash;but he never did&mdash;He was half-hearted. He hated all
these politics like I do. Oh! but it is cruel!...cruel, cruel. Why
is it all? What are all these vague ideas compared to the lives of
those we love?</p>

<p>"He was my man. I would have followed him anywhere. I loved him.
Even at the end I lied to him to make him happy. I tried to comfort
him that what he did was right. I spoke against my convictions. I
would have thrown all my convictions away to give him one hour's
happiness. I would have lied myself to hell. Oh! it is cruel,
cruel&mdash;unspeakable. Millions of these boys&mdash;all the very
best&mdash;just to serve the purpose of capitalist governments. Let
them go in the trenches&mdash;the dirty swine! He was my man. He
was the father of my little one. And now they have both gone. And
the King sends his regrets! Bah! I spit at the King! I hate them
all. A fool of a woman in our road she says, 'You must be proud
that your man died for his country.' Rubbish! What do I care? I
want <i>him</i>. I want my man back. Will his country care for me
and love me? This is all talk, done to blind people to the truth. I
tell you at the back of it all is cent per cent,
contracts&mdash;what you call it&mdash;jobs, profits, and
<i>nothing else at all</i>. I loved my husband, and we were happy,
and they take him away, poison him with their filthy press, dress
him in stupid clothes, blow him to pieces, leave him to die in the
darkness, and then say they regret! O God! I can't bear it."</p>

<p>None of the others spoke. Evelyn was crying, Mr. Querril moved
restlessly in his chair, and Decimus remained immovably silent.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ebba stood up and swayed by the fireplace. Her bosom
heaved and she dabbed her temples with her handkerchief. Her voice
returned to its chilling note:</p>

<p>"Perhaps only in one way I cheat them...I gave my Rodney a
present before he went. A small white packet always to keep by
him."</p>

<p>"What was that?" came from the dark mountain in the corner.</p>

<p>"Morphia!</p>

<p>"Do you think I didn't know all this was going to happen? I have
seen it all a thousand times. My Rodney lying bleeding out in the
open, and I say, 'Anyway they sha'n't make him suffer&mdash;for
long.' I hope to God he was able to take it!"</p>

<hr>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Then Mr. Querril spoke. He said:</p>

<p>"Dear me, how very distressing."</p>

<p>And the singular ineptness of the remark slashed the air like a
knife.</p>

<p>It came more in the nature of an appeal, the cry of a Querril to
have done with all these heroics. It suggested that what was
distressing was not the information imparted by Ebba, but the
atmosphere of crude emotion she was creating. Ebba was genuine
enough, but she never appeared so alien to the Querril world as at
that moment. Fancy dragging all one's niches and shrines into the
open! And then the melodramatic reference to morphia! Who was this
foreign woman coming here and calling Rodney "her man," and
shouting about her love for him like an animal crying for its
mate?...Of course it was all true, horribly real, overpowering in
its primitive force and all the more&mdash;distressing. Distressing
to Evelyn that all the fine sensibilities of her father's
sympathetic nature should be so roused&mdash;almost outraged.
Distressing to Mr. Querril that Evelyn should be sobbing in this
woman's arms, that his friend Decimus should be a witness of the
disruption.</p>

<p>It was not like Rodney, almost an insult to Rodney. Rodney would
be terribly distressed that she should have told them about the
morphia; distressed that she should have jarred the raw edges of
their emotion. Rodney would have said nothing. Any experience he
had had to endure he would have endured&mdash;<i>fortiter et
recte</i>, like a Querril, like a&mdash;gentleman.</p>

<p>The stress of this abrupt experience seemed to pull Mr. Querril
together. He stood up, and patted Ebba on the shoulder. He said
kindly, but with a firm control of his voice:</p>

<p>"There, there, my dear. We must all try and bear this for the
sake of each other."</p>

<p>In some respects it was an unfortunate remark. It appeared to
anger Ebba. The vein she struck was bordering on the
hysterical.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," she cried. "It is all very well for you. You have
'each other.' I have no each other. For me it is all finished. What
is the good of pretending? You, none of you...you don't even like
me. I am alone."</p>

<p>"Ebba, dear," sobbed Evelyn, "you know we all love you."</p>

<p>"You love me at this moment because you are sorry for me. But
to-morrow? Next month? Next year?"</p>

<p>"We will always love you, Ebba."</p>

<p>Decimus winced, and Mr. Querril, who was walking up and down the
room, like an animal seeking some egress from its cage, rang the
bell.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yardley was communicated with. She and Evelyn together got
Ebba to bed, accompanied by the usual two hot-water bottles. When
they had administered what comfort they could, both spiritual and
material, they tip-toed downstairs, and Mrs. Yardley remarked:</p>

<p>"Poor lamb! There's many a million 'aving to go through what
she's going through. Many a million fine young gentlemen like
Master Rodney won't never come back to their wives and sweethearts.
Gawd! that Kayser!...I'd like to 'ave 'im for 'alf an hour alone in
the boiler 'ouse!"</p>

<p>By which dark menace&mdash;playing so fine a tribute of
confidence in her own physical attributes&mdash;Mrs. Yardley
conveyed the idea that her political judgment in any case differed
from that of the lamb upstairs.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>Chapter 18&mdash;The Foreshore
Woman</h2>

<hr>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Peter, encumbered by a heavy kit of sketching materials, walked
briskly up the hill. His limbs, cramped by the confined position in
which he had spent the afternoon, responded joyously to the springy
surface of the moor. He walked on and on, humming to himself, and
absorbing little painters' visions of gorse and hill and scudding
clouds. His cheeks were brown with the sun and wind. His step was
light. For the first time for many years he felt that exhilarating
sense of contact with his surroundings which only good health can
give.</p>

<p>Up and up he went, and suddenly the sea lay before him, a vast
movement of varying lights and colors. The horizon was lost in
mist, except to the east where a long strip caught the sun like a
knife-edge. He hurried on to the edge of the cliff. The expanse of
vision was enormous. A long unaccountable line of foamy green
suddenly ended in a dark bank of blue-gray. In the great scheme of
these elements, tiny ships, revealed at odd intervals, appeared
evanescent and insubstantial.</p>

<p>"This is no painter's job," thought Peter.</p>

<p>But it was very moving, very impressive. He stood there a long
time, trying to take it all in. And suddenly the buoyant mood
passed. The cold hand of loneliness touched his heart. This
panorama, which was so extensive that one could scarcely judge the
scale, produced in him a yearning for companionship. The little
corner of the moor, where he had painted a rough road vanishing
into a clump of trees, was like a friend, tangible and confiding;
but this was disturbing, like finding oneself behind the scenes of
the universe, looking into a workshop where the elemental forces
were turned out. It was like a bland exegesis of fatality. A
million men or a million years, what is it in all this? One small
man in gray flannels, with a sketching outfit-what in God's name
does he matter?</p>

<p>And Peter wanted to matter tremendously. He had muddled his
little piece of life, muddled it and paid the penalty. He had
suffered, been down to hell, and by a miracle he had returned. And
he had found hell a most informing place. It had given him a
clearer vision of the road that lay before him. What was left
should be consecrated to noble ends. There was so much to do, to
build, to understand. And all these things one had to face and
carry out alone. Only...there is a price to virility. The invalid
takes on a kind of protective coloring. The invalid in any case is
spoilt and petted. But when one can swing alone free and strong in
the winds of heaven, is it sufficient to seek noble ends-alone?
Peter turned eastwards. By the gap above Furley Beacon was a path
that led down to the shore. "The family" would probably be
there.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Peter walked briskly, but he could not quite shake off the mood
of loneliness that had suddenly assailed him. And the mood
irritated him because he could not dissipate it with the big
reflections of the philosopher. He could not argue himself out of
it. Was it a physical thing? a legacy of prison life?</p>

<p>"A kind of entailed estate!" he thought. "I suppose all through
my life I shall be a prey to these megrims of melancholy."</p>

<p>The conclusion brought him no consolation. It was weak to be a
slave of moods. He reached the gap by Furley Beacon. He rested for
a moment, and then, as though impelled by some unaccountable
instinct, he hurried down the chalk cutting to the beach. When he
arrived there he sat down, and looked at the sea. It was no longer
a vast and unmanageable perspective, but a low horizon with long
lines of foaming white and gray, humming over the sands.</p>

<p>And then Peter suddenly became alive to the fact that fifty
yards away was the figure of a woman looking out to sea. She was
wearing a blue-gray frock, but she had no hat, and the wind was
gently fanning the free strands of her hair, and pulling her skirt
tightly eastwards, as though possessed with a whimsical anxiety to
see this fine brown hair blow free, and to have a more intimate
view of the slender, graceful figure. And Peter had two
simultaneous thoughts. One was:</p>

<p>"There's some naughty old god out there who wants to tear her
clothes off."</p>

<p>The other was:</p>

<p>"It's the foreshore woman!"</p>

<p>Perhaps, aided by some instinct of chivalry produced by the
first-mentioned thought, but more by the compelling revelation of
the second, Peter Querril threw down his sketching stool and left
all the other paraphernalia of the journeyman landscape-painter in
a heap, and walked across the sands to her. She was right by the
edge of the sea, which seemed to be throwing out its long white
arms seductively. She did not turn till he was within a few yards,
then she swung round and looked at him. It was quite true. In her
eyes there danced the sparkle of the waters, the glow of life in
the making, the love-light made by the sea when God was young. And
she stretched out her arms and said:</p>

<p>"Peter!...Peter! My Peter!"</p>

<p>And he took her hands and kissed them, and they stood there
looking at each other amidst the hiss of the waters, and the
screams of a flock of gulls that had just discovered some
delectable garbage being washed ashore. And for all they knew they
might have been standing on the water, or in the clouds, or in some
place where all is light and movement, where nothing has ever
happened before, but is now happening abruptly,
terrifically...where there is no time, no connection with anything
else, but just one surging effulgence sufficient unto itself.</p>

<p>It was significant that he only kissed her hands. There was a
momentary reaction of constraint. They were like two people who had
been suddenly blinded by looking up at the sun. Peter held her
hand, and said almost limply:</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were here."</p>

<p>She laughed, and he saw the breath of the old god playing around
her smooth cheeks and her disheveled hair. She was talking, but he
was so consumed with the unexpected discovery of her imminence, he
could hardly listen. What was surprising was not that it could
happen&mdash;of course it was bound to happen as surely as that the
tide would reach its appointed landmark-but that it could happen
with such dynamic thoroughness, so suddenly, fiercely, inevitably.
Such a consuming business. What was she saying?</p>

<p>"We were demobilized last Tuesday..."</p>

<p>Now here was a curious position! Demobilized! Fancy demobilizing
a foreshore woman! a goddess! The world was crazy!</p>

<p>"You've no idea how ripping it is to get out of those beastly
old clothes, and get into a comfy frock!"</p>

<p>"My dear, the naughty old god out there was trying to pull it
off you!"</p>

<p>"What are you talking about, Peter?"</p>

<p>They were walking side by side along the shore, and he put his
arm round her waist in the manner of the old days. Now and then
they peeped at each other. How she had developed! She looked
stronger, firmer, finer...but she was still Annette. What was the
mystery of it all? Why was she just "old Annette" of yore, and now
she suddenly blazes down on Mm, a consuming deity&mdash;a foreshore
woman!</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>They drifted under the shadow of the cliff, and Peter said:</p>

<p>"When you stand on the shore why do you gaze out to sea?"</p>

<p>"Well, you silly old thing, I don't know. I suppose the sea's
more amusing!"</p>

<p>Amusing? Oh, no! Peter shook his head. That wouldn't do at all.
They sat on the hollow basin of a rock, and he fumbled with her
hand, as though pondering over the levity of her remark.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why it is, Annette. The sea is afraid of you and
he loves you madly. You see he made the love-light in your eyes.
But he was only the workman. The love-light wasn't made for him.
That's what angers him. He's wearing himself out. He's an
aristocrat, the sea. He thinks the land is bourgeois, a <i>nouveau
arrive</i>..."</p>

<p>Peter looked very solemn. He was trying to unravel the
imponderable, to recall some tangled impression. A whimsical smile
played around the mouth of Annette.</p>

<p>"This doesn't explain why <i>I</i> look out to sea, Peter."</p>

<p>"No...But you see the love-light is there, and it wasn't made
for the sea."</p>

<p>"Who was it made for, Peter?"</p>

<p>"Some thug way over the other side of the horizon!"</p>

<p>"Some what?"</p>

<p>"Some thug!"</p>

<p>"Whatever is a thug?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It's a term Tony used. I think it means a very
unpleasant person...a chap who has done all sorts of
things...wicked things. Played havoc with his life...and suffered
for it. I suppose I'm a kind of thug!"</p>

<p>Peter buried his face in his hands. The smile left Annette's
lips. She was impressed by the curious solemnity of the boy's
manner. He must have endured experiences in which all these symbols
were involved. He was all mixed up-queer. He would have to be
helped out of it. She rested her hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Peter dear, I know what you mean."</p>

<p>They looked at each other's eyes, and the flash of understanding
could not be disregarded. Peter pulled himself up into a kind of
ball. He sat on his haunches, with his arms clutching his legs, and
his chin hovering above his knees. His voice sounded hollow as he
crowded his sentences one on top of the other breathlessly:</p>

<p>"No, no, it's no good, Annette. Don't look at me with those dear
eyes of yours. I'm not good enough for that. I'm all smirched and
spoilt. I've been right down into the deep pit. I'll carry the clay
of it all my life. I'm an outcast, a waster, a&mdash;thug! It's all
a midsummer madness. I've got to see it through alone! Oh, God! how
I envy Rodney. To have gone out in the big way! Given oneself for a
cause...To have lived tremendous, compact hours, and then the
sudden flash and all is over. No regrets, no awful memories, no
legacy of loneliness. I used not to believe in hell, but I daren't
tell...I simply daren't tell what I have suffered&mdash;"</p>

<p>Annette became suddenly very alert. Her shining eyes never once
left his face. It was as though she realized that she and Peter had
stumbled into some awful dilemma, and the responsibility of getting
out of it rested upon her, and upon her alone. She had once driven
a car In France that an aeroplane above was trying to bomb. The
sensation was not dissimilar. She had kept her head on that
occasion, and she meant to keep it on this. Peter was right out of
hand. He raced on:</p>

<p>"I've never told any one before. It's not what they did to me.
It's what I did to myself and to&mdash;the others. I've dragged
them all down with me...Emma. I never really loved her. That's what
makes it so disgusting and yet...you can't understand this,
Annette. You don't know. If you've ever had an experience like that
there's a kind of sacred bond. It isn't just simply an animal
business. And afterwards...Oh, God! I've ruined her!"</p>

<p>Annette sat meditatively apart, her small chin resting on her
hands. There was nothing of the foreshore woman about her now. She
was just a very modern young person who had knocked about the
world, and was facing a difficult situation calmly.</p>

<p>"When I was well enough," Peter continued, "I went up to London
and sought her out. I found that she had left Grete's. He had
turned her out. I waited for her one Friday outside the lawyer's
where she goes to collect the money. She recognized me all right,
but I hardly recognized her. Her face and everything about her had
coarsened. I went home with her. She had a small flat in
Bloomsbury. She didn't seem to hare any bitterness against me. She
was quite normal only...dulled, finished. Even then I didn't quite
realize, not till I had been there some little time. And I shall
never forget, never, as long as I live, the tones of her voice, a
kind of husky lisp...She caught hold of me suddenly and she said,
'Well, come on, kid. What about business?' That's what she
said&mdash;just like that, 'come on, kid. What about business?' And
the words will ring in my ears forever. It was only then that the
full significance dawned on me. Just the atmosphere of the room,
the flashy mirror, scent, a bed only consisting of a mattress and
pillow...And, oh, God! It was I...it was I who had driven her to
this!"</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The sun had set, and the gulls were wrangling amidst some dark
objective along the beach. Martins swung in circles above their
heads, and the sea roared dully as it withdrew its white arms
farther and farther away from these two small people perched upon
the rock.</p>

<p>Annette toyed with a chain round her neck, as though she were
waiting for the storm of remorse to subside. Then she said
quietly:</p>

<p>"Peter, I shouldn't be a bit surprised if you're not a
genius!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You're such a baby! I believe that all great men are like that.
They're just helpless babies about anything except their own job.
Some one has got to mother them all the time."</p>

<p>"You can't understand what it's like, Annette."</p>

<p>"Now you've got to be very sensible. I'm not a fool, Peter. For
four years I've lived among girls and soldiers. I've seen awful
things, moral and physical&mdash;much worse than you have. I know
what goes on. And I've changed a lot since the old days when we did
nothing but play tennis and be sweet to each other. 'The Querril
set'&mdash;as we called it&mdash;gave one a false impression. Life
is a sterner business than that This is how I see your case. It is
quite true that you made a fool of yourself on one occasion. You
were carried away by all sorts of conflicting emotions at the time.
You were absurdly young. You lost your head Well? I know that
crowds of quite nice people do that. Others not quite so nice make
a regular practice of it. It's got to be faced. It isn't the end of
all things."</p>

<p>Peter looked startled. He could not believe that his foreshore
woman could hold such worldly views. It was almost a
disillusionment. He untied his legs and gripped two handfuls of
sand from the beach below.</p>

<p>"But the girl...the result!" he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Peter," replied the modern young woman. "Any
one would be sorry for that girl. She's a slave of circumstances
and environment. Tell me, when she came to the flat, did she give
you the impression of being an innocent child, who had never
been...kissed&mdash;for example?"</p>

<p>"No, as a matter of fact she kissed me first, I remember."</p>

<p>"Now think it over, Peter, and don't tell me the answer. What
<i>sort</i> of kiss did she give you? It's rather important."</p>

<p>"We were standing by the door. Suddenly she put her head back
and closed her eyes. She&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want to know, Peter."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"It's all right. I saw her one day in court. Poor wretch! The
state has made no provision for girls like that. They are
predestined to be women of the street. She had all the
qualities&mdash;laziness, lack of imagination, sensuality, love of
ease, and at the back of it all&mdash;driving poverty. I am very
doubtful whether you were the first. She said her father drove her
there, but she need not have come. She need not have kissed
you...in that way. She need not have come out of the room of which
you gave her the key. And afterwards? Was she upset? Not the
slightest. She shut you out of her life and took the money. She
went to live with a rich man till he turned her out. Before that
she had lived with an Austrian waiter. And now although she has
enough to live on, she still leads an immoral life. It's horrible
Peter, but it's a grim fact. You made no difference one way or the
other."</p>

<p>"I can't believe that! I can't believe it! In any case I
contributed to her downfall."</p>

<p>"Life is a rough-and-tumble, Peter dear, a conflict. We've all
got to take a chance. We're none of us perfect. And sometimes our
imperfections help as much as our virtues. It doesn't do to be
always harking back and sentimentalizing. We destroy ourselves in
that way. If we make mistakes we must still carry on. I learned
that in France. It's a great phrase&mdash;to carry on. Oh! Peter,
you have simply got to carry on, do you understand me?"</p>

<p>The light was failing, and Peter was quite silent. He sat there
for some moments, immersed in thought. Suddenly he became aware of
an unexpected and distressing embarrassment. His companion was
crying. The foreshore woman was leaning forward with her face
buried in her hands. He touched her arm and whispered:
"Annette...Annette!"</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>She completed her sobs to a satisfactory condition of sustained
moisture. Then suddenly she burst out:</p>

<p>"What do I care for all this, Peter? If you can't think of
yourself, think of me. Why should I be destroyed for Emma Troon? I
want to be just selfish. I want to fight for my own happiness. I
love you. Oh! can't you see I love you? I want you. You belong to
me. I won't have you talking all this nonsense. You've suffered
enough. I've suffered enough. I don't want you to regret, to have
all these beastly feelings&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Annette...Annette!"</p>

<p>"Peter, I love you. I would make every experience sacred for
you. I'd wrap my life round yours so that you should not suffer. I
know I 'm selfish, but I don't care. I simply don't care!"</p>

<p>"Annette, I didn't understand."</p>

<p>"Peter, take me in your arms. Hold me tight. Give me your lips,
Peter. I love you. I can't go on without you. Oh! darling, don't
you understand?"</p>

<p>"Annette, I love you. Only I'm frightened."</p>

<p>"Kiss me, Peter. Again...again...again. O-oh!"</p>

<p>It was almost dark. The sea was still receding. The wicked old
god had slunk sullenly away, realizing that the game was up. And
still they sat there holding each other, lost in the mystery of a
magic communion. There was so much to tell each other; all the
little things that had ever happened, and which suddenly seemed to
awaken into new significances&mdash;it was impossible to know where
to begin. So they said nothing at all. They tucked all these newly
important things away among the shrines and niches, soon to be
filled by the little figures of each other's whimsies and desires
and loves. A world was in the making; as yet too crowded with
fragrant anticipations to talk about. They could only peer across
the threshold at eyes which flashed back vast and mysterious
promises, the fulfilment of vague dreams, the dawn of unrealized
imaginings...They touched each other as though fearful of some
twilight treachery. For a long time they would remain silent, then
suddenly break out into snatches of wild interrogative and
passionate affirmation. It was the woman of the world who
eventually said:</p>

<p>"Peter, strike a match!"</p>

<p>He did as he was ordered, and she looked at her wrist-watch.
Then she said:</p>

<p>"Peter, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. It's past nine. The
darlings will think we are drowned!"</p>

<p>The philosopher was too consumed with his own affairs to be
impressed by this statement.</p>

<p>He held her tighter, and kissed her. And the dialogue proceeded
on recognized lines.</p>

<p>"Oh! Peter, can it be true?"</p>

<p>"You're the loveliest thing in the world!"</p>

<p>"I love you."</p>

<p>"Say it again. Five times."</p>

<p>"I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. How
many was that?"</p>

<p>"Four!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Peter, it was six!"</p>

<p>"You darling liar, say it again and you will be right."</p>

<p>"I love you, but I believe you cheated."</p>

<p>"Don't argue, you're wasting time.</p>

<p>"What am I to do, master?"</p>

<p>"Kiss me five times!"</p>

<p>"I've already kissed you a hundred times."</p>

<p>"But you mustn't leave off. You must keep on for years and
years."</p>

<p>"The gulls are watching and the sea is sulky."</p>

<p>"I know. I want the old god out there to have a good view. He
tried to tear off your frock. He has got to understand that you're
mine...mine...mine."</p>

<p>"Oh! Peter!"</p>

<p>And with such banalities do philosophers and angels regale
themselves in pervicacious moments.</p>

<hr>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>In the furnished house overlooking the bay which the Querrils
had taken for the month of August, Mr. and Mrs. Querril, Martin,
and Evelyn were patiently awaiting their evening meal. Magda was up
in Scotland staying with John's people, and her second child, who
was unpatriotic enough also to be a girl, was already three months
old.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Lemaire and Joan occupied another furnished house
barely ten minutes' walk away, and Annette had telegraphed that
afternoon that she was on her way down.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Cecil, with a tooth-brush mustache and a wrist-watch,
and his well-cut clothes, was still somewhere in the East, "Old
Thing-ing" the Sphinx doing his duty punctiliously, ragging, being
a gentleman, and generally contributing to the establishment of the
English code.</p>

<p>Peter had been out sketching since lunch time, and it was now
half-past eight. They always dined&mdash;or supped&mdash;at eight
o'clock, which was late for them, but the arrangement was made in
order to give Peter the benefit of the evening light. Naturally he
was often late. At half-past eight Mrs. Querril decided that George
ought not to wait longer, and so the meal was brought in, and
consumed in tranquillity. At a quarter to nine Evelyn said:</p>

<p>"I know what it is. Peter has met Annette. They haven't seen
each other for four years."</p>

<p>"Peter was always late about everything," replied Mrs. Querril,
as though there were some connection between these two ideas. In
Mrs. Querril's mind everything connected with Peter was static. He
was still a little boy, although destined to marry Annette one day.
She still quoted the incidents of his extreme youth, but from the
day he went to prison she seemed to lose all touch with him except
as regards his material comforts. It was as though by a supreme
effort she had brought down the shutter with such a snap she could
not open it again. She was if anything more openly loving to him,
but it was only the little boy who existed. The fate of Rodney she
accepted like the gentlest of Stoics. Of Martin she talked of his
future and his ambitions, but Peter was a little boy who one day
stole Sir Phillip's apples, who said such quaint things, who looked
such a little angel in the velvet suit with the lace trimming.</p>

<p>She never tired of telling stories about Peter, but if any one
said that they thought it would be good for Peter to go to Paris
and study, or that Peter was growing up and would one day marry and
settle down, a puzzled look would come to her old face and she
would say:</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know, my dear. We must see."</p>

<p>At a quarter-past nine Joan appeared. Her face was flushed with
excitement. She said:</p>

<p>"I am a bearer of good tidings. Annette and Peter have just
turned up at our house. They look too silly for words. They say
they're engaged!"</p>

<p>Evelyn exclaimed, "O-oh! I <i>am</i> glad!"</p>

<p>Martin grinned and said, "Really?"</p>

<p>Mr. Querril pirouetted on the carpet, and jerked out, "You don't
say so!"</p>

<p>Joan threw, her arms round Mrs. Querril and said:</p>

<p>"Aren't you pleased, Aunt Jenny?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Querril smiled, and shook her head.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> pleased, aren't you, Aunt Jenny?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Querril continued smiling pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Peter and Annette?" she muttered after a while. "Why, of
course, dear, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But <i>what</i>, Aunt Jenny?"</p>

<p>"Peter was always going to marry Annette. Don't you remember the
night they were lost up on Folly's Head? We searched all over the
garden and heath with lanterns...I remember poor Lydia, she's dead
now, poor girl! She married the postman at Graynehurst and had
three children&mdash;she wanted to drag the pond by Mr. Burney's
farm, all in the dark by herself. She cried her eyes out because we
would not let her..."</p>

<p>Nothing could convince Mrs. Querril that evening that anything
unusual had happened. She seemed to harbor a suspicion that the
young people were in some way trying to pull her leg. Of course
Peter was engaged to Annette!</p>

<hr>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>When they both appeared half an hour later looking very
disheveled, self-satisfied, and, as Joan said, silly, the usual
formalities of embracing were disposed of very quickly. They were
both too agitated to eat, and Peter was in a hurry because he had
to see Annette home, and loyal Joan slipped discreetly away.</p>

<p>It was nearly an hour later when Annette came home. Joan had
gone to bed&mdash;the two girls shared the same room. Annette half
undressed and stretched herself luxuriously on her bed.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Joan sleepily.</p>

<p>"Life is very nice," replied her sister. "It's all over, and
we're all going to lie around and have a good time. The war has
taught us a lot, darling. It's taught us the great value of
selfishness. I'm going to be just thoroughly selfish and do exactly
as I like forever and ever, amen!"</p>

<p>"Are you?" murmured Joan doubtfully. She was in no mood for
argument.</p>

<p>Annette got into bed and turned out the light. Ten minutes later
Joan was on the borderland of sleep, when she was startled into
wakefulness by a muffled sound. She sat up and whispered:</p>

<p>"Annette darling, are you crying?"</p>

<p>There was a brief interval, and then the whispered reply:</p>

<p>"No, darling, I was laughing!"</p>

<p>&gt;"Why were you laughing, Annette?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know. One just has to sometimes. It's all such a
game!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>Chapter 19&mdash;The Man Who
Grumbled His Way to God</h2>

<hr>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>"<i>For he's a jolly good fellow!</i>"</p>

<p>Decimus shut the door of his flat in Adelphi Terrace, and
entered his comfortable sitting-room. He turned on the electric
light, and walked to the easy chair by the fire. He flung his
cavalier's cloak and opera hat carelessly on to another chair and
sat down.</p>

<p><i>"For he's a jolly good fel-low!"</i>
</p>

<p>The words and music were still ringing in his ears. It had been
a triumph! Nearly every one who counted in the literary and
artistic world had been there. The dinner given to Decimus Postern
on celebrating his twenty-five years' connection with the great
publishing house of Bard, Frobisher &amp; Bard. Sir George Bard
himself in the chair. A jolly, intimate dinner, not too large. All
the wits and characters of Fleet Street. Brilliant speeches,
but&mdash;acclaimed by every one&mdash;the speech of the evening,
that of "Our guest. "Decimus had been in form. He knew he had been
in form. Little epigrams had tripped off his lips&mdash;two quite
extempore&mdash;sly digs at some of his contemporaries, and then
just that note of sentiment towards the end, genuine affection for
the men among whom he had worked, and spent so great a part of his
life. And they had toasted him and sung that song, and Decimus had
felt&mdash;humid and moved. They were dear good fellows, all of
them. Their enthusiasm was contagious. Certainly there had been a
good deal of champagne flowing, but it was not only the champagne
that made them stand up and cry out:</p>

<p>"Good old Decimus! Bravo Dess! Bravo Postern!"</p>

<p>The roar of delight which greeted him when he stood up! He had
drunk very little himself. He might have had a glass or two of
wine. He hardly noticed. Life itself was sufficiently
intoxicating.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years! And he was&mdash;twenty-seven when old
Bard&mdash;now Sir George&mdash;first asked him to be one of their
readers. Twenty-five years ago! What changes and contrasts he had
observed in that time. How many of his dear friends of the eighties
and nineties&mdash;giants in their day&mdash;were now no more! And
then searing gaps among younger men who might themselves have been
giants had it not been for the hungry maw of the great Moloch, who
had demanded them young and fresh and had seemed to prefer them
brilliant.</p>

<p>Decimus lighted his pipe and stared at the fire. He had left
fairly early after the speeches were finished. He had a peculiar
repugnance to the fag end of a dinner like that, when men drink
whisky, and become reminiscent, and maudlin, and indecent. It let
the whole thing down. He wanted to escape to the quiet sanctuary of
this comfortable room and persuade himself that it was all true.
That he was held in respect and affection by his colleagues, that
he was a jolly good fellow, that, in short, his life was a
success.</p>

<p>Fifty-two years old, and right at the top of the tree, famous,
popular, comparatively a rich man.</p>

<p>Decimus stared at the fire, and the little ormolu clock on the
mantel-shelf ticked almost inaudibly, as though endeavoring to
attune its importunate beat to the mellow hour. The coals crackled,
and a small sandy kitten&mdash;the property of old Jonquet, his
factotum&mdash;stretched and yawned luxuriously.</p>

<p>Decimus looked at the clock. It was a quarter-past ten.
Comparatively early. He wished he had not hurried away from the
dinner so precipitately. He felt by no means sleepy. He didn't feel
particularly talkative, but he wanted something...Perhaps to be
talked to, to be cross-examined. If some one were to say...</p>

<p>The mind and imagination of Decimus became acutely active. An
abrupt vision presented itself. The empty Cromwellian chair facing
him. The light from the shaded lamp, the play of the firelight. The
heavy background of velvet curtains. It was the right setting. It
only required its central feature, a feature upon which his
imagination would insist so vividly. A figure, all clothed in one
of those soft clinging things, all ribbons and laces, catching the
firelight. A face half-hidden in the shadows with the little flicks
of hair, silky and gossamer-like, glowing beneath the lamp. And a
voice&mdash;perhaps sleepy and purry like the kitten&mdash;but warm
and caressing:</p>

<p>"Well, dear, was the dinner a great success?"</p>

<p>Ridiculous! Decimus mounted the Trojan walls and sighed his love
towards the empty chair, and struggled.</p>

<p>Fame, popularity, money, what are they all when the chair is
empty? A puling, sentimental old fool, he wasn't going to succumb
to this emotional temptation. God's truth! he was hardened to it
He, the master of words, who had never had the genius to say just
the right few words at the right moment. The only words that really
mattered.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>But it was not only the words he lacked. There must be some
other quality missing. Women liked him, confided in him, found him
sympathetic, and then there seemed to come&mdash;a sudden
emptiness. A lack of technic in the erotic craft. He never appealed
to them in that way. And when he was young, he was not
always&mdash;humid.</p>

<p>Beneath the florid automata of his personality there lay a great
simplicity. He could pose but he couldn't pretend. He could flatter
but he couldn't flirt. He could be ironic, fantastic, incredibly
flippant, but he couldn't betray his conscience. The postures and
insincerities of his appearance and often of his work were things
of which his soul took cognizance and laughed. When he was a young
man he had loved many women in the way that a poet may love the
turn of a couplet, or some haunting phrase. And one by one he had
seen them pass. He had never had the ability to say the right word.
On a day they would come to him and say:</p>

<p>"Have you heard that Phyllis is engaged?"</p>

<p>Or, "Do you know, Decimus, that Olivia is going to marry that
young Seton-Balcombe?"</p>

<p>He had heard all this and quivered. Felt morose, groped at the
new emptiness, and then-observed it in terms of literature. And the
thing would become further and further embedded.</p>

<p>"Decimus, I hear that Phyllis has twins," and "I say, old man,
Mrs. Seton-Balcombe's second boy has been sent down from
Cambridge."</p>

<p>Mrs. Seton-Balcombe's second boy! Oh, God! the ravages of
time!</p>

<p>He was nearly forty when the big thing came. He was already
heavy and slightly humid, not so heavy and humid as now, but no
sort of life-mate for Old Querril's lovely daughter. He saw it at a
glance, never for an instant deceived himself, never showed by the
flicker of an eyelid the insolence of his desires. He merely sat
about, and watched, and waited for the desolating information:</p>

<p>"Have you heard that Magda is engaged?"</p>

<p>And when it came, he made no comment, only he knew that the last
great emptiness of all was on him. And he could not see Magda "in
terms of literature." He could only see her, as on those occasions
which formed some little landmark in his career, a diaphanous
figure seated in the old Cromwellian chair. Warm, sleepy,
furry...irresistible.</p>

<p>"Well, dear, was the dinner a great success?"</p>

<p>Decimus picked up the kitten, and placed it on his knee. It
looked ridiculously small on the vast expanse of his black
trousers.</p>

<p>"Well, Babette," he said. "It's been a great night, hasn't
it?"</p>

<p>He had been a cad after that! Not in act but in thought. A
nasty, searing, trickling thought which obsessed him for a long
time. The war! John! He would be killed! It was disgusting to be
attacked by thoughts like that. Criminal! No, God knows he never
hoped it! It was only that his imagination would run on with the
little pictures. Magda in distress. He, the old friend and
confidant. Magda coming more and more to rely on his sympathy. He
would be so sympathetic...so kind, so gentle. But the war was over,
and he had seen John at Chessilton Heath with the almost scared,
outraged expression on his face as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"They never came out! They never came out!"</p>

<p>His hair had turned gray in four and a half years, but he looked
very fit and strong...only outraged, just outraged that the
purposes of his life had been thwarted. A fine fellow.</p>

<p>And now the third child had arrived. A boy at last. George. Of
course there would be sure to be a George, thrusting him still
farther away. George and the dragon!</p>

<p>The dragon put the kitten down, and sighed, as well as dragon
might sighing for the lists of great adventure and finding
only&mdash;a domestic cat.</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>After all he had had great happiness. Many and very dear
friends. His old friend Querril, and his wife who was now so
delicate, and Evelyn, the only one at home. Rodney killed. Peter
and his wife living in Italy. Magda and her family in Scotland.
Martin married to a Canadian girl and settled in Toronto, where he
was managing a publishing business. Not all according to Mrs.
Querril's dream. Well, we all had to live our own life, and find
love in our own life. You cannot circumscribe the good stuff. You
push on the best way you can, stumbling over each other's
experiences. We're all much better than we think we are. The
trouble is to believe that. There's such a heavy legacy of doubt
and distrust.</p>

<p>"And now they want to legislate our characters," he thought. "To
circumscribe our happiness. The Querrils tried that and failed.
Whatever we do, legislate, preach, educate, repress, there always
comes a point in the story...Who was that who spoke about 'the
story'? Of course that is the whole point. There is a story, and
it's the human factor which makes the story. The genius of men and
women for interfering and being restless. Put away all these ideas
of 'solutions.' Human life is a fluid thing, a story. It goes on
and goes back, and the past is as active as the future. Where the
Querrils fail is that they believe the world has only just been
born, and they try and round it up as though it were a young
foal."</p>

<p>The meditations of Decimus were disturbed by a ring at his bell.
He instinctively glanced at the clock. It was twenty minutes to
eleven. His man had retired to bed. A strange hour for a
visitor!</p>

<p>He got up and walked heavily to the door. The passage was dimly
lighted and he did not recognize the two figures who stood there
awaiting admission. Before he had had time to speak, a man's voice
called out:</p>

<p>"Well, now, that's real neighborly of you, Dess, to be in at
this hour. We're along at the Savoy and I've brought
'herself.'"</p>

<p>"My dear Tony!" exclaimed the large man and he pressed the
other's hand. "Come in. I'm delighted to see you
and&mdash;herself."</p>

<p>"Herself" shook his hand and repeated his name, "Mr. Postern,"
in a pretty, questioning, upward inflection. So this was Tony's
wife! Dear, dear! After all these years&mdash;five years
now&mdash;Here was Tony back again, and lo! dainty as a Donatello
bambino, a fair, smiling, little person&mdash;just the sort of wife
you would expect for Tony, with quick, intelligent eyes and
vivacious manners. Charming!</p>

<p>"I'd no idea," Decimus was saying, as he ushered them into the
room, and Tony went on:</p>

<p>"Yes, well, here we are. We were married in the fall, and we had
a honeymoon down Colorado way. And this is a kind of extension,
revisiting the glimpses of the moon. We arrived at this little old
town this forenoon. After dinner we just buzzed around. Sadi has
not been here before, and she's just crazy about it all. We went up
the Strand and into a sideshow, but she wouldn't sit still. So I
fetched her away, and we were going back home to the Savoy when I
suddenly said, 'Why, see here, Sadi; let's just see if old Dess is
hanging out in the old shanty in Adelphi; it's only two blocks
away.' And so we came right along, and we found the dear old fellow
waiting for us for all the world as though he'd figured it all out
Now tell us all your glad news."</p>

<p>Decimus found himself being mildly but quite unreasonably
surprised that Tony and his wife were not aware of the great
dinner. A bewildering place, London. One can be a hero, a jolly
good fellow in one spot, and a hundred yards away nobody knows or
cares whether you are or not.</p>

<p>Tony was in a characteristic attitude. He stood in the middle of
the room, holding himself very straight, and swaying slightly
sideways, like a top winding itself up.</p>

<p>"Herself," as if to emphasize the fleeting nature of the visit,
perched herself against the arm of the old Cromwellian chair, her
hands buried in her muff, her chin bent down, and her limpid eyes
glowing with pride at the small man, and casting friendly glances
at the large one.</p>

<p>"I wish she would sit down," thought Decimus. But no, this was a
room where people came and went, passed the time of day, borrowed
books, recorded troubles, and then passed on.</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>"I'm afraid my news is all very prosaic," he answered. "Books
and business. A kind of papier-mch existence. I haven't seen the
Querrils for some time."</p>

<p>"Ah! we reckon to go down and see old man Querril and his wife
for the week-end. Later on we're going to stay with Peter and
Annette at this famous villa of theirs at Pisa. Won't that be
bully!"</p>

<p>"Old man Querril and his wife"&mdash;a significant phrase! no
longer the Querrils, or the Querril family, but "old man and his
wife." Decimus envied Tony at that moment with a green envy. Envied
him his young wife, his buoyancy, his eyes of youth. The Querrils
were not an integral part of his life. Just good friends that one
could meet and love and help, and then go on and be recreated in
some new experience.</p>

<p>Tony chatted about old times and friends, and suddenly herself
said:</p>

<p>"Sammy dear, we mustn't keep our friend up."</p>

<p>Why "Sammy?"&mdash;Goodness knows! No, no, you little gray bird,
that's right. Don't keep the dragon from his lair. Fly away to your
snug nest in the comfortable hotel, where you are all alone, you
two, where all the world that matters is. Then in the cozy light
put on one of those flimsy pink and lace things, and then say all
the things that matter. Be <i>real</i> neighborly then. Love him.
People your world with little images of him. Love him with all your
soul&mdash;for he's a good boy.</p>

<p>"Well, Dess, we must get together."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he found himself saying by the door. "Will you dine
with me one night soon? What are your plans?"</p>

<p>The social conventions! How tedious it all was! The great
emptiness and nothing to fill it with but dinners, and plans, and
functions.</p>

<p>"Good night, Dess!"</p>

<p>"Good night, Tony!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Postern!" (the upward inflection of course). "I'm very
pleased to have met you!"</p>

<p>Oh! damn! He bent over and kissed her hand in his best Georgian
manner, but his heart was heavy within him.</p>

<p>When they had gone he went to the window and pulled back the
curtain. The river lay beneath him dumbly reflecting the night sky.
Barges were groping their way along on mysterious errands. Gaunt
buildings and factory chimneys huddled in dark masses, as though
holding up their arms to God in supplication. Right away to the
east was a light in the sky, probably a fire. Perhaps at that
moment buildings were crashing down, lives were being lost...Across
the bridges were streams of cabs and busses, people rushing home
from theaters and restaurants, returning from dubious activities.
Who cared? Let the story go on...</p>

<p>How ridiculous he was to-night! The night of a great triumph!
The jolly good fellow! Success, fame...It was the visit of Tony
which had tipped the scale. If only "herself" had sat in the chair,
and not on the arm! Of course it was very late. He was very
unreasonable. But it was one of those petty things which lingers in
one's imagination, moves one suddenly like an evil portent which
has been there all the time, but which one has only just
observed.</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Old Querril and his wife! What were they thinking? Old Querril,
who with all his urbanity was something of an Eastern in his
passivity. He did not interfere. And yet&mdash;what had been the
result? Peter's terrible lapse. Perhaps if old Querril <i>had</i>
interfered, been more informing and interfering...And then Rodney!
If old Querril had only known the true story about Rodney. Even now
Decimus could see the little piggy eyes of the staff-captain, who
had told him the story as he heard it from some society woman, who
had been told it confidentially by an old brigadier.</p>

<p>"Your son died gallantly leading his men," this was the
communication sent to old man Querril. This was all he was allowed
to know. But it wasn't the truth. How strange that from the Querril
family of all people should spring a tragic horror of interference.
If Bodney hadn't interfered with the Troons, Peter's fatal
interference might never have materialized. If Bodney hadn't
interfered with an army order he might yet be alive.</p>

<p>For Bodney had been shot, by order of a court-martial, for
acting culpably against the orders of his superior officers during
action. The story was very confused. The little staff-captain with
the piggy eyes had not explained it very well. He had demonstrated
with salt-cellars and forks and napkins one evening at a dinner at
the Caf Royale. Decimus was too dazed and perturbed to follow it
in detail. It amounted to the fact that during a retreat Bodney had
acted deliberately against instructions. He believed his plan was
better and he disobeyed. If it had been successful he would
probably have been forgiven. Men have often disobeyed before and
risen to great heights. But Bodney failed badly. It was a terrible
mistake. He misunderstood the bigger idea. As a result a whole
company&mdash;not his own&mdash;was almost annihilated...</p>

<p>And so on a certain morning when the first flush of light crept
over the eastern sky Rodney had paid the full penalty for
interference, standing with his back to the ruined wall of an old
farm. There must have come to him some moment when, as Tony said,
"he was all collected together." All alone he had been. He had
weighed his chance, taken his quick decision-alone. And in that
moment all the weaknesses V and all the strength of the Querril
creed must have been put to the test.</p>

<p>There must have been terrible seconds crowded with vivid
pictures&mdash;the garden at Chessilton Heath, Peter's studio, all
the shrines and niches clamoring for homage, the thousand little
incidents of sentimental association, his wife, his mother,
"George," the photographs, Magda, Martin&mdash;all of them, even
the dogs not left out of the collection...</p>

<p>Decimus could almost see the drawn lines of Rodney's thoughtful
face as he walked between the guard. But would he falter? Not for
one second. Oh! no, Tony, you may call them amateurs, but there is
hope at the bottom of Pandora's box. Rodney would see the game
through. His master-comfort at the end&mdash;that the others would
not know. He would be tremendously "usual," with his slightly
twisted, slightly ironic, smile, and his great pride of soul.
Peculiarly solicitous of the feelings of the guard, almost
apologizing for giving them this early morning discomfort. And when
he waited in the darkness for the greater darkness to envelop him,
his attitude would be a gentle complacence that he faced this last
disquieting experience alone. He would stand there with his heels
together and his heard thrown back as though he were saying:</p>

<p>"Well, God?"</p>

<p>Surely beyond that last bolt of physical disruption there would
come to this sane and purposeful individual some solution...some
explanation of the troubled problems of the life, a life which had
left him perplexed, questioning, restless, dissatisfied?</p>

<hr>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Decimus had visualized this scene a hundred times, but to-night
it was more vivid than usual. The visit of Tony had put the clock
back, the presence of his pretty wife, who would only sit on the
arm of the chair and was anxious to flutter away, emphasized his
own emotional isolation. But his mind was very busy; the old
processes were at work. The thing was reducing itself to "terms of
literature." He almost instinctively reached for the pad on his
writing table and took up a fountain pen. After all, that was his
job, his mission. And it had compensations. A jolly good
fellow!</p>

<p>Poor old Querril! Even he in his way was an interferer. He was a
passive interferer. One might go to old Querril and say, "Sir, your
son has had two years' hard labor for seducing a young girl," and
another might say to him, "Sir, I must congratulate you! Your son
died gallantly for his country."</p>

<p>And one statement would be as effectual as the other in
disturbing his opinions and affections. He didn't require a
government official to tell him about his sons. He knew his sons
better than they did. He would love them in his own way. If one
made a terrible mistake, his mind, which was schooled to make the
broadest allowances, and rather to accept the other fellow's point
of view than his own, would be immediately exercised with the
utmost pity and sympathy. He would be more likely to love and help
a boy who had sinned&mdash;as they call it-than a boy who had
achieved success. A most regrettable thing to have sinned. One must
have endured unspeakable anguish and mental discomfort.</p>

<p>And so old Querril was to an extent an interferer because he
remained impervious to the majestic interpretations of laws,
conventions, and king's regulations. He had been a passive
interferer, but Rodney had been an active interferer, a Westerner,
an Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>Well, well, with all their faults, they were decent
people&mdash;these Westerners. Tony, John, Magda, Rodney, old
Querril, Peter, all different but all very&mdash;Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>A curious race the Anglo-Saxon, restless, not quite knowing what
it wants, with the genius of dissatisfaction more acutely developed
than in any other race. He must crawl all over the earth and see
what's doing. He has an uncontrollable impetus to see over the
ridge. He must go and look at the North Pole, and the South Pole,
and wade through malarial forests in Central Africa. He doesn't
know why, but he just has to do this. Then he returns home and
after a long time thinks about it all&mdash;he's rather slow in the
up-take. And then one day&mdash;or more probably one
night&mdash;something starts worrying him. Those women who threw
their babies in the Ganges as a religious offering. Malay slaves
working in salt mines for Chinese masters. People who mutilate
themselves. And one night when the Teuton, and the Slav&mdash;and
even the Latin&mdash;is sleeping soundly in his bed, he wakes up
and thinks:</p>

<p>"No, but, damn it all! babies in the Ganges! a bit thick!"</p>

<p>And he finds that this disturbs his nights. And one day it gets
beyond him. He suddenly packs up and goes off to interfere. He
takes his golf clubs, and his ridiculous clothes, his zinc chapels,
his gramophones, and his evening dress. And being a practical man,
he thinks:</p>

<p>"Well, as I'm going, I might as well take a few pounds of tea to
sell to the natives."</p>

<p>And of course the malevolent person will say:</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, that's what he goes for!"</p>

<p>But it isn't true. Or in any case it's only partly true. (Every
one acts from mixed motives.) The principal reason is that he is
driven to it by some power greater than himself. He doesn't like
interfering. He's like old Querril&mdash;he detests a situation. He
likes playing games, making money, enjoying himself. But there's
always this old demon of Interference jogging his elbow. There are
certain broad principles of humanity that he is driven to insist
on. He has no objection to what he calls "this tomfoolery of
mysticism." People can have what religion they like, think and act
as they like, but&mdash;damn it all! babies in the Ganges!</p>

<p>He represents as it were a landmark in evolution, the conscience
of mankind, a long, long way back from what the Querrils and their
kind demand, but still a very definite and strong landmark. A
decent chap!</p>

<p>With all his vanities and inanities, repressions, limitations,
and hypocrisies, he's quite the best of the lot. He tries to play
fair, and he's never satisfied. He's always grumbling and grousing.
He grumbles at his successes as much as at his
failures&mdash;rather more so, in fact. And at times he pays a
bitter price for interference. He interferes unwisely and sometimes
culpably, but still he interferes, and there's hope for a man or a
woman or a state which will do that.</p>

<hr>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>The pen of Decimus was busy on the pad. But he was not writing.
He was drawing pigs and wolves and penguins, as these thoughts
raced through his mind. He was himself again. The mood of conscious
isolation had passed. He was with a very dear friend. The thing
began to take shape&mdash;the very newest of the little Wedgwoods.
Decimus glowed. He could see it all. It would come quite easily and
be very&mdash;popular! Not a criticism but a eulogy&mdash;in
fiction form. "The man who grumbled his way to God."</p>

<p>They would simply love it. It would deal with low life
contrasted very sharply with high life, and would preach the gospel
of dissatisfaction. Children must be taught in the schools never to
be satisfied. There must be a chair of dissatisfaction at Oxford, a
grumbler's stool at Cambridge. Of course it must be written in a
light key or else no one would read it. There would be a
dedication: "To the Lady who Always Beads the Last Chapter First."
Excellent!</p>

<p>The pen of Decimus hovered above the pad. A small moth fluttered
across the room and settled on the green shade of the lamp. It ran
up and down it, fluttering its wings. It appeared angry with all
these modern contrivances which prevented it from fulfiling its
preordained mission of self-destruction. Where were the candles of
our ancestors which with simple directness beckoned us to an
obvious and natural fate?</p>

<p>Decimus wrote "Chapter I," but his eye followed the moth. From
the lampshade it made straight for the old Cromwellian chair. It
dusted its wings against its side, polished by the friction of
centuries. But back again it went savagely to the green light.</p>

<p>"You mast know then that the man who grumbled his way to God was
a man like you may be, or like I am&mdash;just a poor,
indeterminate; unsatisfied creature with impulses for good but...a
halting, questioning, half-believing, moral philanderer. Oh, God!
wanting so much to love you and to love the world. Underneath it
all&mdash;a decent fellow, the linsey woolsey fabric of his
mentality..."</p>

<p>Words, words, words! Where has it gone now?</p>

<p>"The man who grumbled his way to God was the son of a poor
carpenter who was born at..."</p>

<p>Oh! go away, little moth!</p>
