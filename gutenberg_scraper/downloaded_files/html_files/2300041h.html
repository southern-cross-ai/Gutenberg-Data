<h2>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2>

<p class="first">British-born and educated at Berlin and Oxford,
Ernest Favenc (1845-1908; the name is of Huguenot origin) arrived
in Australia aged 19, and while working on cattle and sheep
stations in Queensland wrote occasional stories for the
<i>Queenslander</i>. In 1877 the newspaper sponsored an
expedition to discover a viable railway route from Adelaide to
Darwin, which was led by Favenc. He later undertook further
explorations, and then moved to Sydney.</p>

<p>He wrote some novels and poems and a great many short stories,
reputedly 300 or so. Three volumes of his stories were published
in his lifetime:</p>

<p><i>The Last of Six, Tales of the Austral Tropics</i>, 1893</p>

<p><i>Tales of the Austral Tropics</i>, 1894</p>

<p><i>My Only Murder and Other Tales</i>, 1899</p>
<br>

<p>His short stories range from bush humor to horror,
supernatural to strange, and to the privations of late 19th
century exploration in Australia's unforgiving inland. His first
two short story books (consolidated into one volume, as there is
considerable overlap), are available free as an ebook from
Project Gutenberg Australia.</p>

<hr>

<h2>EDITOR'S NOTE</h2>

<p class="first">THIS is the second volume of short stories by
Ernest Favenc which have not previously been collected in book
form since their first appearance in Australian newspapers. They
were collected through TROVE, the on-line Australian National
Library portal.</p>

<p>The two stories, "The Burning Mountain of the Interior," and
"The Mystery of the Pocket Book," were later expanded into the
novel <i>The Secret of the Australian Desert</i> (1894). The
story "The Kaditcha" is a shorter variant of the novelette <i>The
Moccasins of Silence</i> (1896).</p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>1. -- A RACIAL MIXTURE</h2>

<h3><i>Australian Town and Country Journal</i>, 9 Dec 1899</h3>

<p class="first">IT'S a singular feeling to drop out of life
suddenly, and awake in a strange world; but that what happened to
me one day. I was driving down the "Long Hill" early in the
afternoon, an on looking round saw that the shoe of the brake had
dropped off. The horses were quiet, and thought it would not
matter much; but eventually it did.</p>

<p>Something disturbed "Cockchafer," an set him off; and
"Ploughboy," considered a most sluggish animal, followed his
example, and we went tearing down the Long Hill as though the
devil was after us. However, it was only keeping them straight,
as there was an incline the other side of the bridge, where they
would have to pull up. But when we turned the corner, and the
bridge was in sight, I saw, to my horror, that there was a road
party at work, and half the road was torn up. I remember the men
leaving their work and clearing out; I remember a jar and crash;
and then I saw the road flying viciously up at me, find there
came a blank.</p>

<p>I was bound and swathed in a most disagreeable fashion, and
one leg seemed weighed down by some sort of heavy weight, so that
I could not move it. I lazily opened my eyes, and looked around
me; rather more languidly curious than interested. The room was
strange and unfamiliar; but a face I knew was beside me&mdash;the
face of my young partner on the station, George Forest. This did
not surprise me; in fact, I was in the state when nothing could
surprise, me; but my languid curiosity was roused sufficiently to
say, in a weak voice, "What's up, George?"</p>

<p>"You've had an almighty smash, old man, and broke your
head&mdash;and your left leg and several ribs. The fellows
working at the bridge brought you here, as the nearest place, and
here you've been acting the raving lunatic for a week or ten
days."</p>

<p>"Where's here?" I asked, feebly.</p>

<p>"Old Multon's place&mdash;the two hatters as we call them. The
old boy is a doctor, seemingly, and he has fixed you up
splendidly; but you can't move till the leg's right. However, he
turned out to be a regular white man, though the other fossil,
Benjo, is as surly as ever."</p>

<p>Multon and Benjo had a small estate, freehold, next to us.
They kept a few head of stock, but it was so palpable that they
did not live on the proceeds of the land that everyone concluded
that they had a private income, and only lived the life to ensure
a quiet time. They were unsociable in their ways, and universally
disliked; now it seemed that I was an involuntary guest under
their roof. I had an uncomfortable recollection of delirious
dream wanderings, and now asked George if I had been talking much
nonsense.</p>

<p>"Plenty," replied George, with great cheerfulness. "All the
tommyrot one could think of!" This was reassuring.</p>

<p>"You've been here most of the time?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Mostly. Multon and the nigger he calla Alexis and I have
nursed you between us. Now you are right in the straight run
home, and I can go back for a week to see if the place has not
gone altogether to the dogs."</p>

<p>At this moment, the door opened and the nigger came in. What
countryman he was I don't know, but he was a well-developed
muscular man, and had a remarkably wooden face, chopped out of
brigalow by the look of him. As he opened the door there was a
whimper, and a dash, and the little fox terrier, who divided his
attentions pretty equally between George and myself, dashed into
the room, jumped on the bed, and began nuzzling me most
demonstratively.</p>

<p>The nigger looked annoyed. "Mr. Multon said not let dog in,"
he remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," answered Forest, "he can't do any
harm."</p>

<p>The black stood up like a ramrod. "Mr. Multon coming to see
sick gentleman," he said, like an automaton, turned, and marched
out of the room.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards my host, and doctor, Mr. Multon, arrived He
was a tall man, with a white beard, and a stoop. He came to me,
smiling kindly, and asked me how I was.</p>

<p>I commenced, to thank him for his care, and apologised for the
trouble I had caused, but he put it all quietly aside, and would
take no thanks.</p>

<p>"Our friend is on the highway to recovery," he said to.
Forest, "and if you have business on the station; I think you can
leave him in safety for a week."</p>

<p>"Well, you know, Jim, there are a lot of things that have gone
back, as you know, so I won't come for a week, unless I'm sent
for."</p>

<p>We had some conversation on business matters, and then
George said good-bye. Piggy, the terrier, did not follow him, but
remained snuggled up on the bed, with my arm over him. Multon
talked with me for a short time, loosened the splints a little,
and then left me, and shortly afterwards Alexis came in with
refreshments.</p>

<p>So I dozed and ate and drank for a week or more; and I began
to want to see Forest's bright face again, and was wondering why
he did not come, but Piggy proved a very good companion, and
amused me very much. One day Multon came to see me; accompanied
by his friend, Bengo, a dark-looking little devil, whom I had
never seen before.</p>

<p>"Mr. Iredale," said Multon, "I think it is time we understood
each other."</p>

<p>"Where's Forest?" I asked, "why has he not been over?"</p>

<p>"He's been over, but when mortification set in, and you died
so suddenly, he did not get here before you were buried, and he
only saw your grave. He was terribly cut up, I assure you; it was
so sudden and unexpected."</p>

<p>"What folly is this?" I asked, in alarm, all my old dislike of
these men coming back at once.</p>

<p>"It's only the solid truth," said Benjo; in a rasp-like voice.
"You are dead and buried, so he satisfied."</p>

<p>"I'm hanged if I am," I shouted.</p>

<p>"Hush! Don't get impatient." replied Multon.</p>

<p>If there's anything makes a man a prisoner past redemption
it's a broken leg in splints, and I realised this at once.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked. "Explain this nonsense."</p>

<p>Multon touched the bell, and the nigger came. "Alexis," said
Multon, "retire, and return in your national costume."</p>

<p>Alexis retired, and came back naked&mdash;that was his
national costume, as Multon put it. But he was a piebald man. One
of his legs was that of a white man, and I saw now what I had not
seen before, that one of his ears was white.</p>

<p>"Funny looking fellow, isn't he?" said Multon; "he would do
for a side-show. Go out and dress, Alexis; that's enough."</p>

<p>"Mr. Iredale," Multon resumed, "we owe you an explanation. We
are engaged on a wonderful experiment&mdash;nothing less than
turning a black man into a white man. Alexis has had his leg
taken off and a white man's leg engrafted on it; also an ear. We
want another leg for him; yours is an exceptionally good fit, and
we are going to take it."</p>

<p>"What! you are going to amputate my leg, and put it on the
blackfellow?" I yelled, in, horror.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are. Couldn't miss such an opportunity. If Alexis had
a twin brother your leg couldn't do better."</p>

<p>"My sound leg?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Certainly; we don't want a broken leg. Besides, Alexis has
got a white left leg already."</p>

<p>"Just remember," put in Benjo, "that Alexia has got to undergo
amputation as well as you. You need not make such a fuss about
it."</p>

<p>"Not make a fuss about it! Good heavens!</p>

<p>"We had to wait until you were strong enough to stand the
operation before telling you," said Multon, by way of
apology.</p>

<p>"You'll get Alexis's leg in exchange," grunted Benjo.</p>

<p>"I'm hanged if I will!" I shouted.</p>

<p>"Keep easy; keep quiet. You knew a dead man's leg is no good
to us."</p>

<p>"What did you tell Forest?"</p>

<p>"That an unhappy change suddenly set in, and you died of
mortification. Speedy burial was necessary. We showed him your
grave, and a nice one it is, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Think the matter over," said Benjo. "You'll see the sense of
taking it quietly then," and they went out and left me.</p>

<p>Consent to swap legs with a blackfellow! Why, good Lord, they
might keep me until I was well from the amputation, and then make
me exchange arms! Sooner my head; but I was helpless. I looked
around, and meditated; and then that detestable black brute came
in, and brought me my lunch. They fed me well, I'll say that for
them.</p>

<p>Alexis went out with a grin on his blackguard face, and I
sipped a glass of wine and pondered. Piggy smelt the food, and
got up for his share. Then a desperate chance flashed across my
brain. I had paper and pencil on the table, and I wrote, "Dear
George, I am not dead; but soon shall be. Come and save me. Get
the men at the bridge to help. Come to-night, and save me. Batter
the house down, they are murderers."</p>

<p>This incoherent prayer for help I folded up and secured safely
to Piggy's collar. Then I told him to go and find George; to go
home and find him. Piggy looked at me doubtfully; but he had done
it before and he seemed to remember. The window, was open.</p>

<p>"Up boy," I said, and he bounded on to the sill, to the
verandah, and away down the paddock. I felt better.</p>

<p>That evening Multon and Benjo came again. I had secured a
bottle of carbolic acid which Alexis had foolishly left on the
table when disinfecting the room, and this I held beneath the bed
clothes.</p>

<p>"Are you open to reason?" asked Multon.</p>

<p>"We have no time to lose," added Benjo.</p>

<p>"I will never consent; never. You murdering scoundrels, you
must use force."</p>

<p>"Use force; we'll use torture. Alexis, see that all the doors
are safe," cried the venomous little wretch.</p>

<p>Alexis came in to report that all was secured, and the three
approached me. I threw the acid straight in Multon's face, hoping
to blind him, and he staggered back with a cry of pain. And the
cry was answered by a shout; Piggy had delivered my note.</p>

<p>Benjo and the nigger hurried from the room, but the steps were
storming round the verandah, and Forest and the men of the road
party rushed headlong into the room, Piggy barking furiously in
the lead.</p>

<p>"Collar them! Collar them!" I shouted; but they were too late;
all three got away in the night. Benjo was found dead,
self-poisoned; and Multon was found wandering about half-blind
and quite dazy. Alexis got clean away. Noble little Piggy had
gone straight to George, and he had come, hot-foot, and roused
the road party to the rescue.</p>

<p>Many years afterwards. I went into a circus in Victoria, and
there I saw "the wonderful half-white man." It was Alexis, but
his brigalow face never showed any recognitison.</p>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>2. -- THE WASTREL</h2>

<h3><i>Sydney Mail and New South Wales Advertiser</i> 27 Feb
1907</h3>

<p class="first">
BEANDABAR was a township that prided itself upon being one of
the intellectual townships&mdash;I beg pardon, towns&mdash;of
this State. Collectively speaking, perhaps, the main body of the
townspeople attended strictly to business, not intellectual. But
a certain section of the social upper-crust threw itself
vigorously into mental and moral culture.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, their disciples found that the intellectual
strain involved in trying to keep up with their leaders was a bit
of a tax, but still they heroically plodded on. The names of the
different societies and gatherings were many, considering the
size of the place and its population. There was first, the Loyal
and Political League of Beandabar, president, Mrs. Seymour
Skinnah; then the Literary and Historical Society, with Mr Ropah,
a local bank manager, president; the Temperance and Moral Suasion
Society, presided over by Miss Smileover; and, many others.</p>

<p>Let it not be thought that the plebeian and business residents
of the town were not also proud of it. They were. They were proud
of their town hall, their police station and lock-up, and, above
all, of their annual pastoral and agricultural show. On the
show-ground the Cults and the Philistines could meet on a common
ground, and work towards the same end. The editor of the local
biweekly paper, instead of being, as he ought to have teen, a
leading light of culture, was a Philistine of the Philistine.
Moreover, there was a feud between him and the Cults.</p>

<p>Mr. Ropah had written a charmingly clever essay on the name of
their town, proving its derivation from the aboriginal word,
<i>Beyondabar</i>, meaning (so he said) the beautiful hereafter.
It was full of poetical similes and graceful allegories, and the
editor published it. Everyone read it, and felt elevated in
spirit and fitter to live. But in the following issue he printed
a letter signed by the local hotel-keeper, who was quite the
oldest inhabitant, stating that from his knowledge of the
aboriginals (niggers he called them), they neither knew nor cared
about any hereafter, beautiful or otherwise. The name of the town
was taken from the brand of the cattle station that formerly
stood there. The brand was B and a bar, formed thus, B&mdash;,
and that was all there was about it.</p>

<p>This was bad enough, but when in addition, the editor declined
with thanks a lengthy ode on the duck-billed platypus, by the
local poetess, and the first of a long series or articles
entitled "The Education of Our Statesmen" from the pen of the son
of the local solicitor signed "Politicus," the breach was past
healing.</p>

<p>Thus matters stood on the eve of the annual Show.</p>

<p>Now the Philistine party also prided themselves on the
possession of a literary genius in their ranks, who could, in
their own vernacular, run rings around the poetess. He was a
wastrel, a derelict, whom many a good-hearted skipper had tried
to tow into port, but in vain. The hawser always parted, and he
was hopelessly afloat once more, drifting merrily upon a rosy
sea.</p>

<p>The pastoral show promised on this occasion to be one of extra
importance, not only on account of the exhibits, but because the
Committee had captured a loose Minister on tour with the usual
dangling attendance of fussy little members. The Minister,
although, of course, his political faith was all wrong, was a man
of education, so his coming would afford the various societies an
opportunity to "strut and fret" a little. Also, the coming of the
Minister was an opportunity to settle a burning question, then
flaming fiercely as he happened to be that much-to-be-pitied
individual, the Minister for Works.</p>

<p>A line of railway had been surveyed, to come within a mile or
so of the town, and the Philistine party wanted the plans
corrected and a deviation made so that the railway should come
through the town. On the other hand, the cultured party wanted
the survey to stand good. Progress and prosperity was the
watchword of one, beauty and refinement the war cry of the other;
needless to say, both parties had axes of their own to grind.</p>

<p>A deputation was formed from both parties to wait upon the
Minister; but, unfortunately, that busy individual had notified,
when accepting the invitation, that his coming to open the show
at all would interfere with other arrangements, so he hoped they
would cut everything as short as possible, as his stay would be
limited to a few hours.</p>

<p>Then arose the fruitful bone of contention: Which deputation
was to have the first innings? Seeing that there was scant time
for both, and the first might so fritter away the time that there
would be none left for the second, the matter was vital.</p>

<p>The only man not moved by the quarrel was the Derelict. He had
no property, and therefore rejoiced, for at times of excitement
like this the editor found a little space for his clever skits
and pars.</p>

<p>The reception committee finally decided on their programme.
The opening ceremony of lunch, with no speeches, save a word of
welcome from the mayor; after that, the deputations&mdash;but
they must fight the matter of precedence out amongst
themselves.</p>

<p>There was a meeting of the deviation party, and the Derelict
arose and said, "Let them go first."</p>

<p>The editor seconded, and, under the impression that these two
had a card up their sleeves, it was agreed to. The non-deviation
party was elated, and set to work preparing their programme, and
by the time the preparations were finished they had a bill of
fare that would take seven or eight hours to go through; but the
opposition must see to that. The first item was an ode, setting
forth the primitive beauties of Beandabar compared to what it
would be when defiled by the dirt, noise, and hurry of a
railway.</p>

<p>The ode was to be read by Mrs. Seymour Skinnah, and was
supposedly the work of the poetess, but all the influential
members had contributed alterations and improvements until the
poor little author was reduced to the verge of shrieking
hysterics. Mrs. Skinnah proposed that the ode should be at once
printed, for presentation to the Minister and his friends, and
after this was agreed to the other items were hurriedly disposed
of. Mrs. Skinnah had gained her point, she would shine first as
the star; after that the others could be cut short or not.</p>

<p>The Derelict and the editor sat in conclave, which conclave
was interrupted by no less a person than Mrs. Skinnah, who
brought down the ode herself, in order to give some directions
about it. These directions she gave, in the character of a lady
of quality giving instructions to a common printer, making great
play with her gilt <i>pince-nez</i>.</p>

<p>The editor, who was part proprietor, soon brought her to
vulgar earth by mentioning terms, and an argument ensued, in
which she showed herself a veritable haggler. The editor was
beaten, of course, and the president sailed away triumphant. The
Derelict cast his eye over the copy (which was tied together in a
roll, with a piece of blue ribbon), but he had not got through a
dozen lines before he threw it across to the editor, and fairly
"chortled in his joy."</p>

<p>"Give me ten minutes to think it over," he gasped.</p>

<p>Now the Derelict's original scheme was a simple one, nothing
better than bribing the coach driver to frighten them with a
false start. But the ode opened up undreamt-of possibilities. He
confided his amended scheme to the editor, and the two started to
work it out.</p>

<p><br>
THE next day dawned auspiciously, and at 11 a.m. sharp the
coach, with its Ministerial burden, arrived. The town was quickly
deserted for the show-ground, and the opening ceremony commenced.
All went off well, and an adjournment was made to the hotel for
lunch.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Skinnah and the rest of the non-deviation
deputation, were on hot bricks, if such a term may be used to
express the feelings of such refined people. Lunch was nearly
over, and the ode had not arrived. A proof had been duly sent,
and the little poetess had touched the bounds of madness and
gratification mingled trying to correct it. She was a literary
lady, it is true; but, sad to relate, she had not been much
accustomed to proofs, and the present one being more pie than
proof she, after a few tears, failed to make much of it, and
concluding that it was all right and the correct thing, she
proudly wrote her name under it in full with a great flourish,
and sent it back.</p>

<p>Time moved relentlessly on, and then, when the eve of
adjournment was reached, a breathless messenger arrived with an
installment of 100 copies. There was no time to examine them.
Outwardly they looked well, and the first words were right
enough. Copies were hastily distributed amongst the visitors, and
everybody flocked upstairs to the big room to hear the
deputation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Seymour Skinnah advanced, amidst a murmur of applause, to
read the ode. In a few well-chosen words, as the correct term
runs, she gave a short <i>précis</i> of it. She pictured the town
in its present lovely state, and then what it would be like if
polluted by a railway. She began:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
Where smiling peace and tranquil beauty meet, <br>

Shall drunken navies reel along our streets?</p>

<br>

<p>'Navvies, not navies,' whispered the temperance president, who
stood next. Mrs. Skinnah glared at her copy. 'It's navies here.
Who is reading the ode&mdash;you or me?'</p>

<p>Having withered her corrector, regardless of grammar, she went
on defiantly. Everyone who had a copy looked at it while these
amenities passed.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
Where the sweet eucalyptus buds are sprouting,<br>

Shall shilling tourists come out for an outing?<br>

Our youths, in classic groves&mdash;renowned afar,<br>

Go courting pretty Jessie at the railway bar?</p>

<br>

<p>This was too much. The wretched poetess went off into the
long-pending hysterics, screaming out, 'I never wrote it.' Mrs.
Skinnah looked round at everybody in choking wrath, and everybody
looked hard at their copies, amid ill-concealed mirth.'</p>

<p>In the middle of all came up from the street the clatter of
hoofs, the crack of a whip, and the coachman's voice shouting:
'All aboard, gents!'</p>

<p>Never was interruption more welcome. The visitors crammed
their copies into their pockets, and, effusively and hurriedly
saying good-bye, crowded down the stairs. But at the bottom they
were met by the mayor, who turned them aside into the now vacated
dining-room.</p>

<p>'Plenty of time, gentlemen. Coachman mistook the time. Let me
introduce to you the members of the deputation for the proposed
deviation of the surveyed line.'</p>

<p>They were all there. It was impossible to go back after saying
good-bye to the demoralised deputation above stairs, so they
remained, listened leisurely, promised everything, drank, and
departed. As they turned the corner every outside passenger was
seen to be absorbed in the ode. A rush was made for the balance
of the copies, but some quick-witted member of the cult had
secured them.</p>

<p>It was too late. A full report, with the ode in full, came out
in the paper next day, and though Mrs. Skinnah threatened legal
proceedings she could do nothing in the face of the corrected
proof, signed by the luckless poetess, and of which no person
could make head nor tail. With wicked ingenuity and misplaced
cleverness the derelict had interpolated the ode with rhymes and
readings of his own, being careful not to commence his travesty
too abruptly, and arouse the suspicion of the reader, but to lure
her on until she suddenly found herself reading bathos.</p>

<p>The editor took the Derelict in tow once more out of
gratitude, but the hawser parted again, and the Derelict is a
derelict still, but quite happy.</p>

THAT the following story must appear wildly impossible, I am
quite aware, but I simply relate it as it occurred, and as
plainly and truthfully as can.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1881 that three of us left the Cloncurry
diggings intending to push through to Port Darwin, prospecting as
we went. We reached to within 100 miles of the Roper River when
the strange event happened which completely altered all our
plans. My two companions were named respectively Davy and
Hawthorne.</p>

<p>Davy was an old friend, but Hawthorne was a comparative
stranger, a well-made, handsome fellow, middle-aged, with dark
eyes of peculiar force and brilliancy. He had a habit of looking
intently into your eyes when speaking, with a weird stern took,
that would, without doubt, confuse any man of nervous
temperament. His face was marked with a scar extending in a
diagonal direction across his upper lip; his moustache partly
covered it, but you could trace the course of the seam by the
unequal growth of the hair.</p>

<p>Davy and I made his acquaintance by accident about a fortnight
before leaving the Cloncurry. He had expressed a great wish to
accompany us when our proposed expedition was spoken of, and it
ended in his doing so. For the first few weeks we agreed together
capitally. Our new mate made himself an agreeable companion, and
turned out a capital bushman. After a time, however, the novelty
of the situation seemed to wear off, and he showed decided
symptoms of laziness&mdash;that most prolific source of quarrels
in the bush&mdash;besides assuming an authoritative, dictatorial
tone when any of our movements were under discussion.</p>

<p>At last he fairly shirked his share of the common work of the
camp, and quarrels between him and Davy became more frequent than
pleasant. I was an older man, and kept my temper better than did
my friend. At last Davy and Hawthorne ceased to speak to each
other, and the day's journey was generally performed in a moody,
discontented manner, and I was thinking of proposing to abandon
all attempts at prospecting and making straight for Port Darwin,
when the whole aspect of affairs was suddenly altered
altogether.</p>

<p>We had been out between four and five weeks; our horses were
in capital condition, and our supply of rations still good. Since
leaving the last Queensland township we had not seen a white man.
We had no trouble with the natives, and thought we were about 100
miles from the Roper River, without having seen a sign of payable
gold. This was the state of affairs on the last day of November,
when we unsaddled for our midday camp on the bank of a small
creek.</p>

<p>The country through which we had been travelling for the last
three days had been of a poor sandy description, covered with
forest tea-trees and stunted ironbarks. The ridges were badly
grassed, but here and there, on small flats on the banks of the
creeks we found good food for the horses, and it was on such a
small flat that we turned out on this particular day.</p>

<p>After unpacking, Davy went down the creek to fill the billies.
He was away for some time, and when he came back he put the
billies down and said:</p>

<p>"I saw fresh horse tracks in the bed of the creek."</p>

<p>Hawthorne, who was kneeling down lighting the fire, looked up
eagerly, but did not speak.</p>

<p>"Many?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Seems only two," he replied; "one of them has been rolling in
the sand."</p>

<p>"Who on earth can be out here?" I conjectured. "People
prospecting or looking for country, I suppose. But if so there
must be other tracks about, for they would have more than two
horses."</p>

<p>"They may have left or lost these two, higher up the creek,
for they seem to have come down. They are not far off; the tracks
are quite fresh."</p>

<p>Hawthorne had not before spoken. He now remarked, in a
strangely amiable tone, that Davy was probably right; the horses
must have come down the creek, and if we followed it up we should
have probably come to the camp of the owners.</p>

<p>Davy, who at any other time would have opposed any proposition
made by Hawthorne, now seemed struck with his altered manner, and
agreed with him that perhaps it would be as well to spend the
remainder of the day in following up the creeks and finding the
owner, or owners, of the horses. I gave my consent, and in an
evil hour we started.</p>

<p>Davy and Hawthorne went to catch our horses, which had been
turned out to feed while we had our meal, and found that the two
strangers had joined them. As we expected to find the camp they
had strayed from, we drove them on with our spare horses. We
proceeded about five miles up the creek, the country getting more
broken, and barren. Small, white sandy hills covered with scrub,
and here and there huge piles of granite boulders, were on either
side of the creek. The creek itself grew considerably deeper and
narrower during the last two miles, the bed being full of holes
of white, milky-looking water. The tracks of the horses were
plainly to be seen the whole way crossing and recrossing the
creek.</p>

<p>Hawthorne was riding ahead; Davy and I were driving the spare
horses after him. Presently we saw him pull up and point forward.
We looked, and saw in the distance a bough shade. We drove the
horses on, and left them to feed about. The three of us rode up
to the camp. No fire was burning; a few crows rose as we
approached, and flew away, cawing loudly. Davy rode his horse
close to the gunyah, and peered through the boughs.</p>

<p>"There's someone asleep inside," he said as he dismounted.
Hawthorne and I did the same, and Davy entered the rude shelter
unceremoniously.</p>

<p>"Asleep, mate?" he called out. There was no answer.</p>

<p>"Hi!" he called again, then stooped and looked in the apparent
sleeper's face.</p>

<p>"The man's dead," he said quietly.</p>

<p>Hawthorne and I crowded in, and saw a man lying on a blanket
spread over some dry grass, his head pillowed on some articles of
clothing neatly folded up. He was lying upon his back, his eyes
half open; no trace of decomposition visible; life seemed to have
but lately fled. Lifting my eyes from the dead man, I happened to
notice Hawthorne, and was startled by the look of combined joy
and recognition visible in his face.</p>

<p>Again I looked down at the corpse, and the dread fancy seized
me that the dead and senseless body was aware of the evil glance
directed upon it, and that, a fearful, haunted, terrified look
was now visible in the glazed eyeballs. I could stay no longer,
but calling to Davy I hurried out; Hawthorne, with a
half-concealed smile on his face, following.</p>

<p>What were we to do was the next question. Examine the camp,
and see if we could find any clue as to his name, and what
brought him there, was the unanimous opinion. We did so. Outside
the humpy were a riding and pack saddle and a bridle and halter.
Inside were some ration bags, containing the usual supplies, an
empty phial labelled 'laudanum,' a quart-pot with some tea in it,
and a pint-pot, smelling strongly of the drug. That the man had
poisoned himself was evident. His body was well fed, free from
any marks of violence. We next removed the articles of clothing
from underneath his head, and in the pockets found about twelve
pounds in notes and silver, and two horse receipts in the name of
George Seamore. Underneath the clothes, as though pushed hastily
beneath, was an ordinary enough diary, well scribbled in. There
were also such slight articles, as a pipe, tobacco, and
matches.</p>

<p>We carefully examined the body, and made quite sure of the
absence of life. The man had been in life a fine man, with a
determined-looking face, grey eyes, which would not remain
closed, and the shrinking look I still fancied I saw in them did
not, agree with the resolution expressed by the rest of the
features.</p>

<p>We now unpacked and unsaddled, our horses, and, after
arranging our camp, proceeded to dig a grave, this, of course,
being easy with the aid of our prospecting tools. That task
finished, as it was growing dusk, we carried the body to the
grave, where Davy, who was the son of a clergyman, repeated all
he could remember of the burial service. The sandy soil, had
proved easy digging, and the grave was about four feet deep. The
body was simply rolled in the blanket on which we found it
lying.</p>

<p>It fell dark as we finished filling in the grave. I can see
the whole scene before me as I write, the desolate-looking hills,
an unnaturally large, red moon rising behind them making the
fantastic-looking piles of boulders show black and grim against
its light; my two companions and myself standing silent beside
the mound of earth ere we turned away.</p>

<p>Now, during the time that we had been digging the grave,
Hawthorne had left us, and went to the camp, where the body was
then lying. Soon afterwards I called to him, and asked him to
bring some water with him when he came back. Receiving no reply,
I went to the camp myself, being thirsty from digging. On passing
through the camp I saw Hawthorne inside the bough humpy making
what looked like mesmeric passes over the dead body. I called out
sharply to know what he was doing. He started, and stammered out
that he was only making sure that there were no indications of
breathing. I said crossly that there seemed to be no occasion for
that, and he returned to the grave with me.</p>

<p>After our evening meal I tried to decipher the writing in the
diary, but it was too illegible to be read without much time and
trouble, so I put it away under my head when I went to sleep.
From what I had been able to make out, it seemed to be an account
of the life of the man whom we had just buried, written by
himself during his last hours. We talked for some time over this
strange affair, dropping off to sleep one by one. We were
sleeping round the fire, having been too busy to pitch our
tent.</p>

<p>About the middle of the night, the moon then, shining brightly
overhead, I was awakened by feeling something moving beneath my
head. Rousing myself, I saw Hawthorne bending over me, feeling
under my pillow. Angrily I asked him what he was doing? He made
no answer at first, but glared savagely at me, looking straight
into my eyes, and seeming as though he would awe me by the very
fierceness of his gaze, but my nerves were strong, and I looked
back boldly and defiantly, and saw his eyes, drop baffled. But
his strange, almost superhuman, look had affected me more at the
time, than I had imagined.</p>

<p>"I was feeling for your matches, mine are all gone. I am sorry
I disturbed you," he said apologetically. I handed him my
matchbox without a word, and he went back to his blankets and lit
his pipe.</p>

<p>After a short time I fell asleep, first feeling for the dead
man's diary, which I felt sure was the real object of his search.
It was still there where I had placed it.</p>

<p>Once more was I disturbed. Davy shook me by the shoulder, and
called me by name. I raised myself and looked around. The cool
breath of the coming dawn was making itself felt, the moon
sinking low in the west gave but a dim half-light, and, threw
long shadows of the stunted trees upon the white, sandy soil
around us, a few white gum trees on the bank of the creek
standing out white and spectral-like.</p>

<p>Davy was beside me, evidently greatly excited.</p>

<p>"What do you think," he cried, "Hawthorne has gone away with
the dead man."</p>

<p>I stared at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I saw him go, and as I live, the dead man rode with him."</p>

<p>I hope I possess the ordinary courage of men in general, but I
must confess that when this weird communication was made to me in
that ghastly, dawning light in the desert, far from our fellow
men, a thrill of superstitious terror ran through me. I placed my
hand an my companion's shoulder, and at the human touch the
cowardly feeling of terror that I had so weakly given way to left
me, and my courage returned.</p>

<p>"What can you mean, How could he take the dead man with
him?"</p>

<p>"I tell you I saw them go. Listen, can you hear anything?"</p>

<p>We both listened, holding our breath, but the grim stillness
was broken by no sound, not even the natural and familiar night
cries of the bush.</p>

<p>"No," said Davy, "they are out of hearing. A short time ago I
awoke and thought I heard the horses galloping in their hobbles,
away down the creek. Thinking the blacks might be about, I took
my revolver and crept quietly in the direction of the horses.
When I got near the horses, I saw two men amongst them catching
and saddling some of them. Saw them mount and ride towards where
I was watching, I had my revolver ready, and was about to step
out and accost them, when I saw that it was Hawthorne,
and&mdash;" he pointed towards the new made grave.</p>

<p>"The man could not have been dead."</p>

<p>"What time is it?" said Davy in reply.</p>

<p>"Half-past four or so," I said, and stooped for my watch.</p>

<p>"And what time was it when we buried the man?" my companion
went on.</p>

<p>"About 6 o'clock or so!"</p>

<p>"Say that he was in a trance when we buried him, would not the
weight of earth have been sufficient to suffocate him in less
than one hour let alone seven or eight?"</p>

<p>I could only answer, "Yes&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was going to say, could not Hawthorne have dug the man up
again as soon as we went to sleep? Then I remembered that I had
seen Hawthorne in the camp in the middle of the night. I looked
for the book, with the horrible dread in my heart that the dead
man might have been feeling under my head for it, and was
relieved to find it still there.</p>

<p>I told Davy of the circumstance of Hawthorne trying to get it,
as he was on his knees busy reviving the fire, and its bright
cheery blaze seemed partly to scare away the dismal horrors that
lingered round our haunted camp.</p>

<p>All Hawthorne's traps were gone; he and his unearthly
companion must have carried them down to the horses. We both
shuddered at the thought of the living corpse' moving about the
silent camp, and perhaps stepping across our sleeping bodies.</p>

<p>Our horses were all there; Hawthorne's two and the strangers
we had picked up being absent.</p>

<p>"Shall we track them up?" I asked, when we were ready to
start.</p>

<p>"No, no," said Davy. "Let us get away from here. I don't feel
myself. I feel quite nervous and cowed."</p>

<p>So we started, first inspecting the grave, which we found
tenantless.</p>

<p>We pushed on during the ensuing few days, and in my spare time
I managed to decipher the blurred manuscript.</p>

<p>The history revealed by it coincided so strangely with our
late experience that we could doubt the evidence of our senses no
longer. But it was so unheard of and incredible and brought back
all the horrors of that night so forcibly and vividly, that our
only wish was to speedily reach a settlement of our fellow-beings
in order that our minds would cease to dwell and brood upon what
we had seen.</p>

<p>In a little more than a fortnight we reached the overland
telegraph line, and, following it along northward, came to a
working party, and there Davy fell sick, and could not travel. He
rapidly grew worse, and although everybody was most kind, we
could do but little, and I soon saw that the end was not far
off.</p>

<p>I was sitting by his side one night, when he roused himself
and spoke to me.</p>

<p>"I have told you all that I want you to do, old fellow, except
one thing, which I have left to the last. When I am dead, watch
over my grave for at least a week. Promise that, you will save me
from that horrible fiend. Make sure of it before you leave
me."</p>

<p>I pressed his hand, and told him that I would.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, old friend; it's hard to die like this, but what we
know of would be harder still."</p>

<p>Before morning he died, and I was left alone, the possessor of
the horrible secret. We buried him before sunset; all hands
knocked off work and attended, and then my watch commenced. They
thought me mad, the men on the line, thus to carry out a whim of
my dead comrade's, and if they had known what I sought to guard
his body against they would have been sure of my insanity, but I
did not tell them.</p>

<p>With snatches of broken rest in the daytime, I kept my promise
for more than a week, and then, when all semblance of life must
have long departed from the body beneath, I relinquished my
armed watch, and bade farewell to the kind friends who had
behaved so hospitably.</p>

<p>From what I could learn, no strangers but ourselves had struck
the line for many months. Where, then, did Hawthorne and his
dread companion go to?</p>

<p>I have never learned.</p>

<p>I left poor Davy in his lonely grave, with the silent
messages, that had travelled so many thousand miles, flashing
over him, and hastened to port.</p>

<p>Change and travel and a busy life obliterated to a certain
extent my hideous experience; then suddenly the other day it was
all brought back to me. My resolution is taken; I will keep
silence no longer. In a few days, if I live, I will leave
Australia, and if the body of that unhappy wretch found no peace
in the wilderness, perhaps the depths of the ocean will be more
kind to me when my time comes.</p>

<p>The reason I have come to this resolution, and publish my
story after so many years of silence is that the other day, in
Sydney, in busy George Street, I met the man called George
Seamore, the dead man we buried in the bush, face to face, and he
turned and followed me. Here, to further show my reason, is the
dead man's diary, as we found, it in the camp:&mdash;</p>

<h3>2. GEORGE SEAMORE'S MANUSCRIPT</h3>

<p class="first"><i><b>November 29, 1881</b></i></p>

<p class="first">
TO-MORROW is the anniversary of the day I was born, and on
that day I have determined to die. Why I should have been singled
out to be one of those unfortunates who have learned that there
exists such people in the world as the living dead I know not.
But it is in the hope of escaping from their unhappy fate that I
have sought this lonely place to die in.</p>

<p>Death I fear not in itself. Would that the doctrine of the
soul's total annihilation were true, how I would welcome death.
But if my wretched soul should be forced to reanimate my body,
and the baneful influence that has embittered my life finds me
out even here, in this desolate desert, O! what unutterable woe
will be mine!</p>

<br>

<p class="first">Now for my story:</p>

<p>I can say little for myself beyond the fact that I have always
been moderately well off and fond of travel. When I was 25 years
old two people entered into my life, who affected it I greatly.
They were Fanny Berrimore and Francis Hawthorne.</p>

<p>Miss Berrimore I met through her brother, an artist, whose
acquaintance I. had made when travelling abroad; the other,
Hawthorne's, was a chance acquaintanceship, which, how I know
not, from no particular wish of mine, developed into intimacy,
but not friendship. Towards Miss Berrimore I soon felt more than
friendship; but at the present moment I do not feel inclined to
enter into the relation of any of the incidents of our love
story, unhappy as it was, excepting the tragic circumstances of
her apparent end and after-life, for she was&mdash;and thankful I
am to say "was"&mdash;one of the living dead.</p>

<p>I am Devonshire born; but the incidents I am going to relate
occurred in London&mdash;London of the sixties and seventies, not
London of to-day. I was then living in London, as were both Miss
Berrimore and Hawthorne. Miss Berrimore was living with an aunt
in the suburbs, for she and her brother were orphans; and
Hawthorne, like myself, lived in chambers. On one of my visits to
Miss Berrimore I found that she was very anxious about her
brother, from whom she had not heard for more than twelve months.
I promised to do my best to obtain any information about him; but
as I knew he was of a roving disposition I did not anticipate
that any evil had befallen him.</p>

<p>A night or two afterwards Hawthorne came to see me, and we
strolled to his rooms, and there the conversation turned upon
spiritualism, in which we both expressed our entire disbelief.
Presently Hawthorne got up, and, standing-with his hand on the
mantelpiece, spoke as follows. Every word, for good reason, is
printed on my memory:</p>

<p>"Spiritualism! pooh! Mere jugglers' tricks. I believe in what
I have discovered myself&mdash;or, rather in my realisation of my
father's discovery, which an unfortunate accident did not allow
him to complete. It is a marvellous secret; but I will tell you
nothing of it now. I will tell you something of my ancestry.
Have you ever heard of the white Malays?"</p>

<p>"Never. I have, of course, heard the various traditions of
white races being found in various unknown parts of the world;
but never of a white Malay race."</p>

<p>"Few people have. They are small, but powerful and rich, and
are more among the sea Dyaks than the land-dwelling Malays. My
father was a chief amongst them. Do I show any trace of mixed
blood?'</p>

<p>"I looked at him earnestly, thinking this was all humbug.</p>

<p>"Your eyes are peculiar. Not Caucasian, certainly. Peculiar is
the only word I can find; although I have travelled much, I
cannot locate them."</p>

<p>"No, of course not. My father was an educated man, who had
also travelled much, and married an English lady of good birth,
whose family never dreamt that he was of pure Malay stock. Why
should they; not half a dozen Europeans know of the ancient race
of the White Malays, and they are merely scientific ethnologists
pure and simple. My father was on the eve of a wonderful
discovery, which would have been actually the consummation of
what our ancient priests had been long striving after, when death
intervened. A violent death, I need scarcely say; but he had
taught me, and I have reached the result he did not live to
attain."</p>

<p>"Well" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing more at present; the time has not yet come. Would you
like to see my servant? I don't think you have met him."</p>

<p>I gave assent, and he rang the bell. The man who came in
answer could scarcely have been told from a European, except that
he had eyes like Hawthorne's, but covered with a sort of film
that deadened them somewhat.'</p>

<p>"Take down that kriss," said Hawthorne, pointing to some
Eastern weapons that decorated one of the walls. The man
obeyed.</p>

<p>"Draw it."</p>

<p>He took it from its sheath</p>

<p>"Why is it not clean?"</p>

<p>"Your orders, Mr. Hawthorne," came the reply, in a dead level
voice, without intonation.</p>

<p>"Kiss those rusty old bloodstains."</p>

<p>The man bent his head and kissed the discoloured blade, then
replaced the weapon, and left the room, without having taken note
of my existence.</p>

<p>"That man was my father's murderer, and that was the kriss he
killed him with."</p>

<p>I rose from my seat, disguising what I really felt.</p>

<p>"I confess I did not at first believe in your story; but now,
somehow, I do. At least, you ought to have Malay blood in you,
unless you are only an actor, and a clever one."</p>

<p>Hawthorne only laughed.</p>

<p>"Come to-morrow at 10 o'clock. I am going to see a man in the
condemned cell at Newgate. I want you to come with me. Will you
come? The visit partly bears upon what I have been telling
you."</p>

<p>I hesitated, but consented, and left. I slept soundly that
night&mdash;no ghostly visitant haunted my couch&mdash;and I was
only just in time to keep my appointment. On our way to Newgate
we talked of the man and his crime. It was a notorious one,
principally from the disappearance of a large sum of money which
the victim had lost his life in defending, and the stolidity and
indifference to his fate of the culprit.</p>

<p>After the usual formalities we found ourselves in the
condemned cell, and in the presence of two warders and the
prisoner. Strange to say, I recognised the man at once, but could
not determine where I had seen him, nor who he was. Then I
noticed that he had the same set, filmy eyes as Hawthorne's
servant. Some trivial conversation passed between my companion
and the man&mdash;enough to justify the order of admission
Hawthorne had obtained&mdash;and we left. But the man never once
looked in my direction, although I was anxious for him to do so,
to account for the likeness which I could not fix.</p>

<p>Wild suppositions began to course through my brain, for it
suddenly struck me that he resembled George Berrimore, the
missing, artist brother of Fanny.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear if the criminal's name of Darcy Blake is an
assumed one or not?" I asked as we made our way to the restaurant
where we had agreed to lunch.</p>

<p>"I believe that it is his proper name. It is the name under
which I had the pleasure of his acquaintance. Why do you
ask?"</p>

<p>"Because," I replied, led on by blind impulse, "I heard
somewhere that his real name was Berrimore," and I looked hard at
my companion.</p>

<p>He started perceptibly. "Berrimore; George Berrimore? He is
dead. He died in Marseilles a year ago."</p>

<p>"You knew him, then?"</p>

<p>"Slightly. Did you know him?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well; and that man bears a strong likeness to him. I
know his sister, and she has not heard of his death; so she is
anxious about him. I promised to make Inquiries for her."</p>

<p>"And you commence by looking for him in the condemned cell in
Newgate. Very complimentary to Miss Berrimore."</p>

<p>I could have bitten my tongue out.</p>

<p>"No, but the resemblance was so striking and strange."</p>

<p>"What I know of George Berrimore is this. I met him in
Marseilles, where he was ill and friendless. As a countryman, if
you can call me one, I looked after him, and finally saw to his
burial. I have still In my possession a few sketches of his,
which he consigned to my care to deliver to his sister, whose
address I have lost. You seemingly know her, and I can now fulfil
my mission."</p>

<p>I felt very disinclined to introduce him to Miss Berrimore,
but there was not a loophole of escape; and I had to consent to
go out with him after lunch. During lunch, I could not help
talking about Blake, and the missing money. Hawthorne seemed to
dislike the subject, so I dropped it, and, at the proper time we
went to call on Miss Berrimore.</p>

<p>It was naturally not a pleasant visit. Miss Berrimore was
grieved to have her worst fears about her brother confirmed, and
I was sulky at hating been the means of introducing Hawthorne to
her. I was glad when the time came for us to leave.</p>

<p>"Seriously speaking," said Hawthorne, as we parted. "I have
something of Importance to submit to you. Will you dine with me
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Something about this wonderful secret?"</p>

<p>"About the wonderful secret."</p>

<p>"Then I'll come. By the way, that poor devil Blake is to be
executed to-morrow. I wonder what became of the money?"</p>

<p>Hawthorne turned livid. "I wish you would talk of pleasanter
subjects," he stammered, as he turned away.</p>

<p>Hawthorne's dinner the next evening was admirable, and he
seemed in exceedingly good spirits; and talked and rattled on as
gaily as possible. But when everything was cleared away, and we
were by ourselves, his manner became more serious.</p>

<p>"What would you say," he presently said, "if I asked you to
swear, never to confide the secret I am about to reveal to
you?"</p>

<p>"I would swear, if you desired it; and if the secret to be
learned justified the importance of taking an oath."</p>

<p>"Then swear." he said; "or give me your word. I hold that as
good.</p>

<p>"The secret is connected with science?"</p>

<p>"The secret is connected with the most abstruse science."</p>

<p>"Then you have my word."</p>

<p>"Never to reveal to living man what I am about to tell
you."</p>

<p>"It shall not be revealed by me during my life."</p>

<p>"My reason for telling you is, that I want a coadjutor. I
might look long before I found a man to suit me as well as you
would. You possess every requisite, of firm nerves, strong will,
and vigorous health; Will you assist me? Will you share with me a
dominion greater than man ever dreamt of before? A dominion over
the dead."</p>

<p>"What can you mean? You are mad," I sternly replied.</p>

<p>"I mean that I have realised my father's dream. I have found
the true source of existence. Not the elixir of life, but almost
the opposite. I can bring to life those who are called dead, if I
can obtain possession of their bodies within twenty-four hours of
their decease, or apparent decease."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! You are fooling me!"</p>

<p>"Fooling you? Was I fooling you when you saw my father's
murderer kiss the bloodstains on the kriss? A man whom I killed,
and then brought to life again."</p>

<p>"You ask me to believe that you possess the prerogative of the
Almighty. That we still live in the days of miracles. I cannot
believe it."</p>

<p>"Then you shall have proof; but if I give you proof will you
consent to join me?"</p>

<p>"To what end?"</p>

<p>"I will communicate the results to you. Know that the men by
me restored to life, for good or evil, know no will but mine.
They are my slaves forever after. My influence permeates their
new being, and they, they live again but to carry out my
wishes!"</p>

<p>"Grant that you are not raving; still, I do not see the
end."</p>

<p>"Not see the end!" he cried, his dark eyes blazing with
excitement. "Not see the power it puts into the hands of two such
men as you and I are&mdash;with life growing strong enough within
our veins to revivify a hundred dead men! Not see the end to
which such abject slaves could lift us&mdash;men who, at our
bidding, and for our sakes, would dare and endure all the evils
and dangers that beset life, would go at our command to the ends
of the earth&mdash;and the foot of the gallows!"</p>

<p>"Wretch!" I cried, starting up. "Do I read you aright? Was
that poor man who died this morning a death of shame one of your
victims? And was his crime committed at your instigation?"</p>

<p>"He died as you say, at my command. Now do you believe?'</p>

<p>"And his name was, as I thought, George Berrimore?"</p>

<p>"His name when he died at Marseilles a year ago was George
Berrimore.'</p>

<p>"And you received the missing money?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I did not get the man hanged for nothing. Since I
killed the man you saw acting as my servant, I cannot return to
my people to claim my father's wealth."</p>

<p>Conviction was forced upon me.</p>

<p>"And you ask me to join you in a career of robbery and
murder!" I cried in blind rage and indignation. "Rather do I
esteem it my duty to humanity to kill you where you sit."</p>

<p>He started visibly as I advanced towards him, and I saw where
his weak point was&mdash;that he was a coward. In spite of the
terrible knowledge that he possessed, I was physically and
morally his master, by reason of my higher courage and firmer
nerve.</p>

<p>"Stand back!" he cried. "You have sworn never to reveal my
secret, and I defy you to break your oath."</p>

<p>"I did not pass my oath to keep such horrible crimes as yours
secret."</p>

<p>"Do you want Miss Berrimore to learn that her brother perished
on the scaffold? Do you wish the criminal's real name, and her
name, too, to be made a public scoff?"</p>

<p>He was right, however he had guessed it. For her sake, I made
the sad mistake of not taking that wretch's life on the spot. He
saw my irresolution, and springing to his feet sought by quick
mesmeric passes to subdue me to his influence. But my will was
too strong for him to cope with, and I laughed
contemptuously.</p>

<p>"No, no. I am mot to be made one of your slaves quite so
easily. I leave you, this time, unharmed, but do not cross my
path again, or seek to exercise your unhallowed arts any more, if
they are aught else but wild dream. If we again meet, it will be
as bitter enemies, so beware;" and I caught him by the collar and
shook him till he trembled in every joint when I released
him.</p>

<p>Such a fierce gust of passion had never before possessed me,
and I felt strong enough to defy Hell itself; and if ever a fiend
from Hell stood before a mortal man; it was that man.</p>

<p>As I turned to go, he mustered up some little courage and
said, "Beware in your turn. Your spirit now is more powerful than
mine; but if I find you when that life, now so strong and fierce
within you, is ebbing weak end low, then it will be my turn.
Beware of death and my power after death, wild dream as you call
it."</p>

<p>I only laughed in derision, and left him.</p>

<p><br>
I SAW Miss Berrimore a few days afterwards, and found her
somewhat recovered from the shock of the news of her brother's
death. Now that I knew the truth about Hawthorne and her brother,
I felt in a difficult position. I could not well warn her against
the man who, she believed, had befriended her brother in his last
moments, without giving her some potent reasons, and the real
reason was too horrible and Incredible to even hint at. I had to
go home to my parents for a short time, and on my return we were
to be married. In that brief space it was not probable that
Hawthorne, after the thorough fright I had given him, would
venture upon anything do bring down my vengeance on his head, so
I left on a three weeks' visit to my home. After a week I became
restless and uneasy, and on the tenth day could restrain myself
no longer, but hastened back to town, and my first visit was to
Miss Berrimore.</p>

<p>The house was but a pretty suburban cottage, for her aunt's
income was limited, and when I reached there I found, to my
surprise, the door ajar, and the servant apparently out, for no
one responded to my ring. I entered, therefore, unannounced, and,
proceeding to the drawing-room, found Hawthorne and Fanny alone
together. A look of deadly fear came over him at my appearance,
but, forgetting everything in the violent wrath excited in my
mind by seeing Fanny and Hawthorne on apparently affectionate
terms, I simply sprang at my enemy, and the next moment he lay on
the floor with his upper lip split open.</p>

<p>There was no struggle worth speaking of, for the craven made
no resistance. Fanny cask into a chair, and, even in the midst of
my fury, I could not help notice her listless manner, and even
indifference to what had just taken place. I looked from her to
the man who lay on the floor, afraid to move, and, spurning him
with my foot, I left the house, choking with rage. I walked
quietly home when I got in the street&mdash;my rage was too deep
for any outward demonstration. All idea of Hawthorne's
pretensions to infernal or demoniac powers was lost sight of
utterly is the whirlwind of jealous frenzy excited in my breast
by what I thought to be Fanny's duplicity. I left town, and
returned home, but could not persuade myself that I had not been
misled during the dreary months that followed. So wretched did I
get that I went again to London, determined to seek an
explanation which I thought might be forthcoming.</p>

<p>I went to the cottage, and was received by her aunt, who was
dressed in deep mourning. She refused my hand, and asked me
stiffly what brought me there. I stammered out that I called to
inquire&mdash;to see Miss Berrimore.</p>

<p>"You will find my niece in Kensal Green Cemetery," she said,
bitterly. "Where you sent her."</p>

<p>My amazement must have been visible in my I face, for she went
on, "Without cause or reason you neglected and left her, and, in
her state of health, that killed her."</p>

<p>What could I say! Her aunt was evidently in complete ignorance
of my visit and discovery, and, rightly enough, judged me with
the greatest harshness. I said something about there having been
a misunderstanding, but she stood coldly and silently awaiting my
departure, bad I could do nothing but leave, writhing under the
feeling chat I had been made a dupe of by Hawthorne. I visited
Kensal Green, and saw her grave. With deep penitence in my heart
for the girl I had wronged, and a determination to wreak the
utmost vengeance on Hawthorne when I found I him, even if it
brought me to the gallows, I left the cemetery.</p>

<p>Months passed, and I sought my enemy high and low, but could
find no trace of him. He and his living dead men were too cunning
for me. One day I saw him, or thought I did, and turned to follow
him to make sure. Directly afterwards I was run against violently
by a well-dressed person, who apologised for his clumsiness. But
the accident was enough. I had lose my man. It was no accident, I
knew, for I had recognised the peculiar face, and the set eyes,
of the man who had kissed the kriss, in the person who had bumped
against me.</p>

<p>A few days after this incident I was loitering I moodily on
one of the bridges one night. The hour was late, and the crowd
was thinning, and I stood for a moment looking at the lights of
the town, and the shipping, and the dark water running beneath
me.</p>

<p>A policeman was watching me furtively, evidently expecting me
to take a header over the parapet. A female figure hastily
approaching brushed close to me, almost touching me, a strange
thrill passed through me, and I an uncontrollable impulse made me
spring after her. I overtook her just as she was passing under a
lamp.</p>

<p>It was Fanny! The woman whose body I thought lay in Kensal
Green Cemetery was by my side! My exclamation of surprise and
horror seemed not to affect her in the least, for she kept
steadily on her way, and I by her side. The policeman looked
keenly at us. He little thought that it was a dead woman I was
walking beside. The merry party who made room on the pavement for
her would have had their mirth suddenly checked had they known
the girlish form that flitted through them had stepped from
amongst the buried. Steadily she kept on, and the joyous thought
flashed through my brain that by following her I should find
Hawthorne, so I dropped a step or two behind. On we
went&mdash;the living and the dead&mdash;until she turned down a
narrow blind alley, reached a door in the wall, I opened it with
a key, and passed in. Before she could close it, I had pushed in
too, into a small courtyard, surrounded by high buildings rising
in the gloomy night.</p>

<p>She did not notice my entrance, but hurried into one of the
houses&mdash;I still close behind her&mdash;Up a narrow stairway
into a lighted room, where three men were sitting. They took no
notice of either of us. A hasty glance assured me that my enemy
was not amongst them, but I felt assured that I had found the
lair of himself and his slaves.</p>

<p>Fanny opened a door leading to an inner room, and in it I saw
a man lounging indolently in an easy chair. I had found him. She
handed him a note, and then sat down. He tore the note open, and
read it, while I stood behind his chair, my heart leaping gladly.
Having read the communication, Hawthorne tore it up, and stooped
to cast the fragments in a basket, and in doing so he caught
sight of me. The scream of terror he gave was such music in my
ears; and the next moment he was calling loudly to the men in the
next room for help, for he saw murder in my face.</p>

<p>They came rushing in, but before they could do anything I had
hurled him half strangled to the floor, and was standing over him
with a hastily snatched-up decanter in my hand.</p>

<p>"Order them back," I cried, as they were rushing at me, "or
your life pays forfeit first. I'll beat your brains out
quickly."</p>

<p>"Back! back!" he cried in an agonised voice. "Don't kill me,
Seamore."</p>

<p>"Send them out of the room. Now, what have you done to her?" I
pointed to Fanny, who was sitting in a listless and indifferent
attitude.</p>

<p>"What do you want? What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Remove your power from over her. If you can. Give her back to
me."</p>

<p>"I cannot. She will die again if my influence is removed. She
knows you no more. Her name is Caroline Booth now."</p>

<p>"I care not whether she lives or dies, so that she is no
longer your victim. I will give you but a few moments to make up
your mind. Consent!"</p>

<p>"I consent to anything," he said, cowering and I
shrinking.</p>

<p>"If I spare your life, you will relinquish any hold you may
have over her mind or spirit, and allow me to take her away
wherever I like."</p>

<p>"I will, and never again seek to interfere with I her."</p>

<p>"This is the second time I give you your life for Miss
Berrimore's sake; but if we meet a third time, when she is dead,
and beyond your reach or power, I promise nothing. I do not trust
your word, but I do to your cowardice. I fear no more the
punishment I should incur through I murdering you than I do you
yourself."</p>

<p>"She will die, I tell you; but you shall have your wish."</p>

<p>He went over to her, and made some mesmeric passes, and she
shuddered slightly, and looked a little more like her old
self.</p>

<p>"You will go with this gentleman; do you I know him?"</p>

<p>She looked at me dreamily, as though some confused remembrance
still existed, then took my hand, and said, "I will go with him,"
and looked in my face curiously.</p>

<p>I had locked the door when I allowed Hawthorne to rise, and
now stood with my back I against it, while I asked him another
question.</p>

<p>"Was it through some of your devilish arts I that I was misled
that day?"</p>

<p>"It was. Miss Berrimore's aunt was out and I tried a mesmeric
experiment on Miss Berrimore, and had just succeeded when you
interrupted us. She knew nothing of what passed, and I without
doubt it was your desertion killed her. She could imagine no
reason for your leaving her without a word of explanation."</p>

<p>I took Fanny away, and have never seem Hawthorne since, hard
as I have striven to find and I kill him. But the last glimpse I
caught of him standing looking at me with sullen, deadly hate is
ever present to my imagination.</p>

<p>His prediction was, true; Fanny soon faded away, and died
about three weeks after I rescued her. I visited her constantly
in the home I found for her, but she had lost all resemblance of
her real life, Me she remembered, more by some mysterious
influence I appeared to possess over her than by reason at our
being formerly acquainted.</p>

<p>She died, painlessly and quietly; and I buried her in the same
cemetery where, even then, her body was supposed to be resting,
and I let her sleep under her assumed name.</p>

<p>How Hawthorne obtained possession of her body in order to
bring her back to life I cannot conjecture. By means of so many
devoted adherents, it would not, perhaps, be a hard task.</p>

<p>Since then I have been a wanderer, and am now weary of it.
Often I have recognised the living dead men, and I fancy I am
always watched, and the thought has become unbearable. Were it
not for his want of physical courage, the power of this strange
creature would he immense, for I am convinced that he claims no
more than he can accomplish; and, as I cannot find him, I am
going to seek rest in this solitude. My body will, I trust, meet
no worse fate than to moulder and decay unnoticed and unburied.
Still, before I take the last step, I have put these crimes on
record.</p>

<p>This is my birthday, and in a few hours my life will be spent,
and, hundreds of miles from my fellow men, I will render up my
soul, In the hope of at last finding peace.</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>4. -- NEVER SAVE A MAN FROM THE SEA</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i> (Sydney) 21 March 1896</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THE sea beat fiercely on the rock-bound coast; only one little
nook, well sheltered, invited landing, while the wind blew from
the quarter, it was then in. Over and over again the two men in
the boat scanned the uninviting shore before them, until they
sighted the entrance to the little cove and the sandy beach
beyond. Wearily, but hopefully, they pulled towards it; at the
least it meant a rest from the tossing sea.</p>

<p>In time they reached it, and found that it was the entrance to
a large salt water creek emerging from the mangroves a short
distance inshore. They ran the boat on to the beach, and landing,
enjoyed the luxury of a rest, which in the cramped area of the
boat, had been impossible. Shortly, one of them got up and
strolled round to inspect the spot that had sheltered them.
Presently, he came across some rocks above high water mark, the
sea-worn holes in which were full of fresh rain water. After
taking a refreshing drink, he called to his companion, and when
he came and had enjoyed the same luxury, they washed the salt
scum from their hair and eyes, and sitting down began, for the
first time, began to talk.</p>

<p>'Where to now?' asked one, in French; a short-set,
black-haired, black-eyed man, of athletic build, although like
his companion, much wasted with semi-starvation.</p>

<p>'That is a difficult question to answer. The ranges behind us
are high, and covered with jungle. Whether to go north or south
the sooner to strike a town I cannot say, but food we must have
soon.'</p>

<p>The speaker was tall, slight, brown-haired and brown-eyed. He
was evidently educated, and had once occupied a higher social
position than his companion in misfortune.</p>

<p>'I thought you knew this coast,' growled the other.</p>

<p>'Know it,' said the brown-haired man, looking up with a flash
in his eyes; 'of course I do, and if I knew where we are could
easily find food and shelter; but how in the name of God are we
to find out exactly where we are?'</p>

<p>'No, there are no sign posts about here, truly,' assented the
other; 'but we can manage with what food we have left for three
days, and get on for a day longer perhaps. Say four days. How far
can we make in that time?'</p>

<p>'Not very far, if the country is bad for travelling.'</p>

<p>'In the boat?'</p>

<p>'Not so far; this wind from the south-east will blow for many
months. I know him.'</p>

<p>'Seems a bad lookout, any way.'</p>

<p>'It does, but we can at any rate stretch our legs.'</p>

<p>The shorter man walked towards the mouth of the little inlet;
the other began to trace out lines in the sand with a bit of
drift wood. A shout from his companion, aroused him, and he went
towards him. A sail was in sight coming past their refuge,
seemingly close inland.</p>

<p>'What will she be?' asked the darker man.</p>

<p>The other regarded her fixedly for some time.</p>

<p>'Pearl-shelling schooner,' he said at last. 'I think we had
better try and signal them to pick us up; as a rule, they are
good fellows, and not particular. Fetch the boat down, Francois,
it is our only chance.'</p>

<p>The short man obeyed, and the fairer one remained motionless,
watching the approach of the schooner. Very soon his comrade
returned, sculling the boat, and entering it, both men pulled
steadily to get into the track of the schooner.</p>

<p>They were seen, and the schooner ran up in the wind and lay
there with flapping sails until they pulled alongside, and
climbed on board. A colored crew were scattered about the deck,
but a couple of white men were on board, and one stepped forward
to interrogate them.</p>

<p>'Speak English?' he asked, having eyed them up and down, and
decided on their nationality in his own mind.</p>

<p>'I do,' replied the fair one of the two.</p>

<p>'Humph!' I needn't ask where from; you've got the stamp of New
Caledonia on you.'</p>

<p>'My friend and I have escaped from that hell of an island,'
returned the other in very good English. 'But, I beg you to
believe that our offences were political only.'</p>

<p>'So I suppose,' returned the other with a sneer; 'but it's
nothing to me. I suppose you are half starved, and don't exactly
know where you are. Well, you are about 200 miles from anywhere
on the coast except a lightship, unless you can cross that range,
and that's all jungle and stinging tree. Now what do you want me
to do?'</p>

<p>'My name is Hyacinthe Merande; my companion is François
Lepêtre. He is a good sailor. I am an educated man; can keep
books, or do anything clerical.'</p>

<p>The master of the schooner reflected for a moment. 'I will
give you your choice,' he said. 'I can spare you some rations and
water, and you can go ashore again and take your chance; or you
can come with me to my station and help me for a year, without
pay; then you can get a slant to get away, for the hunt will be
over by that time.'</p>

<p>Merande, the spokesman, explained the offer to his companion,
and after interchanging a few words with him, he intimated to the
master of the schooner that they accepted his last offer.</p>

<p>'And the best thing you could do. There is only my station on
the island, and no one will know of your being there, for we
don't entertain much. But mind you, I make my men work, don't I,
Tom?' addressing the other man, his mate.</p>

<p>'By &mdash;&mdash; you do,' returned he, somewhat grimly.</p>

<p>The skipper smiled, as if at a compliment.</p>

<p>'Is your boat worth anything?' he asked of the Frenchman.</p>

<p>'Firewood,' was the reply.</p>

<p>'Nothing in her you want?'</p>

<p>'Nothing.'</p>

<p>'Jump down Tom, with an axe, and start a couple of
planks.'</p>

<p>Tom did so; the sails were shaken out as the wind once more
caught them, and as the boat disappeared the schooner flew away
to the north with her new passengers.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
THE station was fairly comfortable, situated on a small island
in the Straits, named after Torres. A handsome, brown, island
woman, the captain's wife by courtesy, presided over the
establishment.</p>

<p>The said captain, whose name was Sween, owned a good number of
luggers, and Merande soon found that the work was pretty constant
and regular, as predicted. He kept the books, overlooked the
stores, and did most of the land work, Lepêtre being berthed on
the schooner, and employed on the usual handy sailor's jobs.</p>

<p>Sween, however, was not ungenerous. He supplied both men with
all requisite clothing, and treated Merande as one of his
household. This naturally brought him much in contact with the
beautiful half-caste girl Lurance, and the fire of a mutual
passion was ignited. Naturally Lurance's uncurbed nature soon led
to her neglecting her protector <i>pro tem</i>, and quarrels
between her and Sween became frequent; and Sween, who was a
violent-tempered man, often had recourse to personal
chastisement.</p>

<p>The end came at last. One night Merande was awakened by the
hasty entrance of Lurance into his room. Her eyes flashed in the
darkness, and when Merande struck a light he saw that she held a
blood-stained knife in her hand.</p>

<p>'I have done it;' she said. 'He struck me again, and then I
told him that I hated him, and loved you. He swore he would send
you back to prison, and I snatched up the knife and stabbed
him.'</p>

<p>'Is he dead?' asked Merande, somewhat overcome by the
relation, which so suddenly broke up his own schemes for the
future.</p>

<p>'Dead! Would Lurance strike twice?'</p>

<p>Merande pondered. 'Lurance,' he said, 'We must seize the
schooner and fly.'</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>'I can easily forge an order in Sween's handwriting which will
satisfy Tom, the mate,' he reflected. Forgery was the crime he
had been transported for.</p>

<p>'Lurance, go back and collect what things you want: meantime,
I will write an order to Tom in Sween's hand to come ashore and
bring four men. That, will leave two on board. With these, two,
François, myself, and you, we can manage the schooner.'</p>

<p>Lurance hurried away, and Merande set to work at his desk. He
was soon disturbed. Lurance burst in, breathless with terror.</p>

<p>'He is gone. I struck not deep enough!'</p>

<p>'Confound your tongue, woman,' he cried, as it struck him that
but for her boast he might have been safe. 'What devil made you
confess that you love me?'</p>

<p>'But you do, Hyacinth, you do my love? We can both die
together;' and she fell on her knees with her supplicating brown
eyes turned up to his.</p>

<p>But her beauty had suddenly become abhorrent to him. All he
wanted was to escape, but he was too late.</p>

<p>As he glanced at the door, it was burst, open, and Sween stood
there leaning on Tom, the colored boatswain with them, all
armed.</p>

<p>Both man and woman were secured, and taken on board the
schooner, and with the morning breeze she stood out to sea. But
Tom the mate and François Lepêtre were left behind.</p>

<p>Six days afterwards the schooner returned, and taking these
two on board, made sail for Thursday Island.</p>

<p>Arrived there, a signal for the water police boat was run up.
Lepêtre, quite unconscious of its meaning, was standing on deck
when the Resident, his coxswain, and a couple more men stepped on
board. Sween drew the Resident on one side.</p>

<p>'The dark man, there, is an escapee from New Caledonia, by his
own confession. I have kept him at my station on B&mdash;Island
until I had time to bring him in. His name is François
Lepêtre.'</p>

<p>'I have been warned of his escape, but I confess, captain,
that I believed you to have been the last man to have given a
poor devil up.'</p>

<p>'I have my reasons,' said the other grimly.</p>

<p>The Resident signed to the coxswain, and the next moment poor
François found himself between two men, handcuffed.</p>

<p><br>
ONE of the steamers for China sighted a derelict boat, and as
they drew near, saw that it was occupied. A boat was lowered, and
in the derelict lay the body of a man shrivelled by the sun, but
in his breast, thrust through a piece of paper, was a knife. On
the after thwart was the bowed form of a woman tied by the wrists
to a ringbolt. When the doctor went down to examine them, he
found that her tongue was cut out.</p>

<p>The bodies, sewn in one canvas, were buried at sea with due
solemnities, and the boat sunk.</p>

<p>On the paper was printed in plain letters, <i>'Never save a
man from the sea; he will injure you.'</i></p>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>5. -- THE JUSTICE OF CAPTAIN DAMPIER</h2>

<h3><i>Australian Town and Country Journal</i>, Sydney, 14 Jan
1899</h3>

<p class="first">
ON a low, rocky rise, over-looking the Indian Ocean, three
haggard and weather-beaten men were seated. The view before them
was scarcely encouraging. The tail end of a gale was still slowly
dying out, and the grey sea stretched, bleak and gloomy, under
the squally sky in a broken expanse of mountainous white-crested
waves.</p>

<p>Below them, on the fringe of beach, lay the shattered hull of
their ship, at times left almost bare by a receding waive, and,
again, covered with boiling foam. In the preceding night of storm
the unfortunate <i>Oostkappel</i> had crashed unexpectedly on the
gales-swept, barren coast of New Holland; which, owing to the
faulty reckoning of those days, the captain and pilot still
thought a hundred miles to the eastward.</p>

<p>Three survivors only had as yet mustered up, and now,
drenched, hungry, and miserable, sat on the inhospitable coast,
wretchedly meditating on their fate. One was short and broad In
build, such as the Dutchman is popularly supposed to be, but the
other two were tall and fine-looking men, with blue eyes and fair
hair, genuine Frieslanders, whose fathers, as the "Beggars of the
Sea," had harried the Spanish ships, and flouted the navies sent
out by the morose Phillip the Emperor. The Dutchman proper was
the pilot, named Jan Jacobs; the other two were cousins. One had
occupied the responsible position of second steersman; the other,
and younger, man was a simple sailor. Both bore the name of
Janszoon, the elder's name being Frederick, and the younger's
Pieter.</p>

<p>Janszoon, the elder, got up and shook himself like a dog
emerging from the water.</p>

<p>"It's no good sitting here watching the poor old
<i>Oostkappel</i> break up into kindling wood; let's go along the
beach and see if any of our mates have got ashore, or perhaps a
keg of biscuits has been washed up."</p>

<p>Jacobs got up with a groan. "This is a horrible country, and
only fit to wreck ships on. People say it shifts its position,
and I believe it does, for the bones of many a good ship are on
it. It was here, on this accursed coast, that Pelsart lost the
<i>Batavia</i> some fifty years gone."</p>

<p>"True, I have heard my father speak of it; he came back with
Pelsart in the <i>Sardaarm</i>, when they hanged the mutineers.
'Twas a bloody morning's work, as he many times has told me."</p>

<p>The younger man did not speak, but seemed to implicitly follow
the lead of his cousin without question.</p>

<p>"'Twas bloody work the mutineers did here," Jacobs grumbled,
as the three proceeded to the beach; "and I hope the sheets don't
haunt these rocks and sands, as likely they do."</p>

<p>"Be their Indians on this strange land?" asked the young
sailor.</p>

<p>"Indians! aye," replied Jacobs, "and, as report goes, they are
giants and cruel cannibals."</p>

<p>Filled with cruel forebodings as to the future, they tramped
along the beach, seeking for any wreckage or stores the hungry
waves might cast up. They found a cask of wine, and some barrels
of flour and biscuit, and set to work to roll them up the beach
out of reach of the tide. There was plenty of rain waiter in the
rocks, and when Jacobs had eaten, and the wine cask had been
started, he began to look at things in a more hopeful light.</p>

<p>"When the tide is low and the sea calm, we shall be able to
get down below, if she doesn't break up any more," he said,
referring to the hull of the <i>Oostkappel</i>. "We shall get
plenty to eat and drink, and some arms against the Indians."</p>

<p>"I fear there are no more living of our company," said
Frederick Janszoon.</p>

<p>"No, poor souls, there were so many down below, when we
struck," answered his cousin. As he spoke a watery sun shone out,
and the clouds began to break and show rifts of blue sky. This
raised their spirits still more, and they recommenced their
search for any of their shipmates who might have got ashore, but
by the evening they had found but three dead bodies, one of them
that of the ill-fated captain of the ship.</p>

<p><br>
THE following morning was clear and beautiful. The sea had
gone down considerably, and the tide was low when they emerged
from the rude shelter under which they had passed the night.
Naturally their steps were directed to the wreck, which to their
delight they found far enough above low water to be quite
accessible. The elder Janszoon went over the hull, while Jacobs
and his cousin inspected the hold and cabins. These two looked
pale when they came on deck again.</p>

<p>"They lie there dead, many of them," said Jacobs. "It would be
a good act to bury them before doing anything else." The late
steersman nodded, and their mournful task occupied them most of
the morning.</p>

<p>"We can make a boat, I think," said Janszoon, when they had
finished, and were eating a meal. "But we need not hurry, for we
must not venture to sail for Batavia until the wind sets in from
the south-east. Is that not so, Master Jacobs?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in these seas it blows for many months from the
south-east, and it is then fine weather. What is that?"</p>

<p>He leaped to his feet as a cry was heard. A human cry, but
evidently not an Indian shout. Along the bank at the back of the
beach came the ragged figure of a castaway sailor. He waved his
hands and shouted to them when they called, to him.</p>

<p>"It is that rogue, Matthys Lants," muttered the young sailor.
"The sea could not take him, seemingly, but it took good
men."</p>

<p>"The sea knows who will be hanged, and never interferes with
them," grunted, Jacobs.</p>

<p>The elder cousin silently went to meet their comrade, whose
resurrection did not appear over welcome. He brought him in and
gave him food and drink.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" he asked, when the man was
refreshed.</p>

<p>The fellow, who was of the same appearance as the other
Frieslanders, replied volubly that he had been dashed ashore half
stunned, and when he recovered he had wandered away In the
darkness and had only just found his way back to the wreck. He
ate and drank ravenously, and no wonder. Jacobs spoke to him as
though the fact of the wreck did not alter their relationship as
sailor and officer, which was a different tone he used to the
other two, and Pieter scarcely noticed him at all.</p>

<p>Next morning the sea was calm, and the weather clear, and all
through the time of low tide they worked at the wreck removing
stores and what-ever was undamaged. Jacobs, who recovered from
his despondency occasioned by the loss of his ship, assumed his
proper office, and the work went on smoothly enough.</p>

<p>"I see your cousin still wishes to keep up our quarrel even in
this desert land," said the last comer, Lants, to the elder
Janszoon, one day when they were away from the others.</p>

<p>"You were not born to be friends, and your character Is not of
the best. I should advise you to keep out of Pieter's way, and
not to cross him. He is quick with his hands at times."</p>

<p>"And I am quick with my knife, if any one lays hands on me;
was it my fault that pretty Geertje preferred me to him?"</p>

<p>"You have been too quick with your knife before now, so many
say, and if this wreck had not stopped our voyage you might have
danced at the yardarm before we came to Java."</p>

<p>"Those who say so, lie. I have had quarrels forced on me, and
know how to take my own part."</p>

<p>"Take care," said the silent steersman, so sternly that Lants
went away muttering under his breath.</p>

<p>Once or twice the Indians (as they were always then known)
appeared at a distance, gazing curiously at the shipwrecked
party, but they never approached close, nor offered to molest the
visitors in any way. And time passed, and the boat, which was to
bear them to Batavia, approached completion.</p>

<p><br>
THE winter of the southern tropic set in, and the steady
south-east trade rippled the quiet blue water all day, and died
down in the evening occasionally, only to spring up fresh in the
morning. Jacobs looked smiling and he said to Janszoon, "We can
hurry now, and soon we shall see the fort at Batavia, and the
fine houses along the Tiger Canal. Oh, but I am tired of this
sandy, rocky country, where there are no beautiful trees and
green meadows."</p>

<p>"I would we were away, for I mistrust that knave Lants; he and
my cousin were nearly at blows yesterday, had I not parted
them."</p>

<p>"What was the quarrel about?"</p>

<p>"'Tis an old sore. Pieter loved a pretty maid, Geertje
Barcman, but this Lants came along, with his pockets full of
money, and his mouth full of lies, and he spoiled Pieter's
wooing. That's what made the boy come to sea, when he was doing
better at home. Geertje, silly fool, found she had lost the
straight stick and taken the crooked one. Lants lost his dollars
at the gaming house and the tavern, and came on board the
<i>Oostkappel </i>a penniless sailor. You know all about him
there."</p>

<p>"And little good. I believe he was the man who stabbed Bergman
the night of the brawl, though we could not prove it."</p>

<p>All was finished at last. The boat floated buoyantly in a
little saltwater creek. She bad been taken out for a sail, and
proved herself staunch and sea-worthy. Now she lay with all the
stores on board, ready to take wing in the morning. The remainder
of the lading of any value had been removed from the wreck and
concealed. The men sat around the fire, and Jacobs had served out
an extra ration of wine, and they talked of their departure and
drank to their safe arrival at Batavia.</p>

<p>One by one they dropped off to sleep, and the musical sound of
the sea wash on the beach alone broke the silence. The fire had
died out, and the stars showed it to be midnight, when one of the
recumbent forms rose up cautiously and listened, then with
noiseless footsteps stole out of the camp. It was Lants, and
scarcely had he vanished in the shadows of the scrubby trees
around than young Janszoon rose with equal caution, and followed
him.</p>

<p>Lants crept down to the creek where lay the boat, and stood
for a moment listening. There was not a breath of wind, and he
knew that he had come down too early, for the wind generally
sprang up about two hours before dawn; and he felt that he toad
made a mistake, for some one might wake up and miss him from the
camp. He stood and hesitated, If he went back and somebody awoke
he must forego his treacherous scheme; if he used the oars he
might be heard; he stooped and felt the muddy bank&mdash;the tide
was falling, that would suffice to carry him far enough out
before daylight.</p>

<p>He stooped over the painter to untie it from the tree to which
it was fastened and felt himself seized from behind. Lants was
not so strong as his assailant, but he was strong enough to make
a hard struggle, and managed to free one hand, and draw his
knife. Then his captor's grasp relaxed, and with an effort at a
shout for succour, young Pieter fell. Hastily severing the rope
with the blood-stained knife, Lants pushed the boat off as he
scrambled in.</p>

<p><br>
UP at the camp Janszoon raised himself up and listened; the
muffled cry had partly awakened him. The feeling of unrest in the
air awoke Jacobs. "What's the matter?" he asked, seeing his
companion sitting up.</p>

<p>"I know not. I thought I heard a cry. Pieter," he called.
There was no answer, and rising, the steersman went to where his
cousin ought to have been.</p>

<p>"Jacobs!" he cried, "there is foul work on hand; Pieter and
Lants are both gone!"</p>

<p>"The boat!" cried Jacobs, and set off towards it.</p>

<p>The boat was gone, and Jacobs feeling about for the painter,
touched the body of Janszoon, the younger with his foot.</p>

<p>"The rope is cut," he said, "and here I fear lies your
cousin."</p>

<p>They stooped down in the darkness, but the knife had done its
work. Blue-eyed Pieter would never see the flat fields around his
native village of Luytjegast again.</p>

<p>Jacobs put his hand on Frederick's arm for silence. They
listened, but not a sound was borne to them. The cautious
homicide was drifting with the tide noiselessly and safe.</p>

<p>"To the beach!" whispered Jacobs, "we may catch him yet."</p>

<p>The party retraced their steps, and, while Jacobs ran to where
the creek debouched into the sea, the other went back to camp and
picked up a loaded musket. So surely and quickly did he go that
he reached tho entrance of the creek almost as soon as
Jacobs.</p>

<p>"He is gone," cried the latter, speaking loud in his
excitement. A mocking laugh came from seaward, not very far
away.</p>

<p>"Speak again," said Janszoon, softly, at the same time
pointing his weapon.</p>

<p>"Come hack, you ruffian!" thundered Jacobs.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! My skilful pilot! Come back to be tried in Batavia
for desertion. No&mdash;"</p>

<p>The report of the musket drowned his words, and a sharp cry of
pain came from the darkness. They listened, but all was silent;
when suddenly the steersman exclaimed, "A light, a ship's light!
See!"</p>

<p>Far away in the distance a star that wavered and moved shone
out.</p>

<p>"A discovery ship, or one of ours from the Texel."</p>

<p>There was a sudden flash, and over the water carne the report
of a carronade.</p>

<p>Moved by the one impulse both men made for the camp, where
Jacobs picked up his weapon and fired a signal in return. The
light burned steadily as they watched, but it did not move
on.</p>

<p>"We can do nothing but make the fire up and wait for
daylight," said Jacobs.</p>

<p>"Only go for him," answered the Frieslander. Jacobs
understood, and together they went in the darkness and brought
the body of the murdered man back to the camp. Then they sat down
and watched, ever and anon glancing at the steady light at sea
that told of hope and help.</p>

<p>The first gleam of dawn appeared, when the pilot suggested
they should go on to the higher ground to obtain a better view.
As the light grew strong they saw a full-rigged ship hove to not
more than a mile away. An ensign fluttered up to her peak and
blew out with the light moraine breeze.</p>

<p>"Not Dutch nor Spanish," said Jacobs. "Ah, I know the flag, it
is an English one. It is good, she is a King's ship, and we are
friends."</p>

<p>They looked eagerly round for their boat with Lants on board,
but they could not see him. A boat left the ship and came quickly
ashore. As they went to where the hull still lay, the party
landed, and a man, who was evidently the leader, advanced to meet
them.</p>

<p>"You are from Holland?" he said in fairly good Dutch.
"Shipwrecked sailors?"</p>

<p>"I am Pilot Jan Jacobs, and this is the understeersman of our
ship, the <i>Oostkappel</i>. She lies there," and he pointed to
the wreck.</p>

<p>"I am William Dampier, captain of the discovery ship
<i>Roebuck</i>, in the service of the King of England. We are at
peace. Can I give you passage to Batavia or elsewhere in the
Indies?"</p>

<p>"Surely we shall be grateful as men rescued from a lingering
death. But first, Captain Dampier, there is a foul murder to be
avenged." As shortly as possible Jacobs told Dampier of the
wreck, and what had happened since.</p>

<p>"The boat lies behind that point of rocks. We saw it as we
came in; the man will not be far off."</p>

<p>He put a ship's whistle to his lips, and a petty officer came
up at the summons. Dampier gave him some orders in English, and
he called some sailors, and they proceeded over the neck of land
that formed the rocky point Dampier had mentioned. Meantime the
English captain and the two sailors proceeded to the camp of the
latter.</p>

<p>"Shall I have a grave dug for him?" said Dampier, looking at
the body of the young sailor.</p>

<p>"No, captain," answered Janszoon; "give him a sailor's
burial."</p>

<p>Dampier nodded, and they waited until the party returned over
the rise; with them Lants, his arm, which had been injured by the
shot, bound up in a cloth.</p>

<p>As the captain saw the prisoner, a glance of recognition was
exchanged.</p>

<p>"You have an old comrade of mine here I find," he said grimly
to Jacobs. "The rogue knows me too, and would have put me ashore
here when we were In the <i>Cygnet</i> eleven years ago."</p>

<p>"Marooned you?" asked Jacobs.</p>

<p>"Yes, the rascally pirates, because I objected to some of
their goings on. By God! it was nearly being done too, and this
villain was one of the leaders."</p>

<p>"Captain Dampier has heard of your murderous conduct and
would-be desertion of your comrades in distress. What have you to
say in your defence?" asked Jacobs.</p>

<p>"I have much to say, but not here. This is New Holland, and I
am a free Dutch sailor of the company. Bring me to my trial in
Batavia, Captain Dampier, for that's what he is now, I
understand, though he was only a buccaneer when I knew him, has
no power as a King's officer over me. I demand to be tried by the
high court in Batavia."</p>

<p>"The rogue was always a sea lawyer," said Dampier, "and I
doubt but what he has right on his side. I fear I shall endanger
my commission if I hang him here, as high as he deserves."</p>

<p>Jacobs looked astonished, and Lants grinned.</p>

<p>"What say you, Master Jacobs?" resumed Dampier, "if I take him
in irons to Batavia? Will that suffice?"</p>

<p>"It will not suffice me," said Janszoon, "I will kill him with
my own hand."</p>

<p>"Nay, my man, there is no killing on my ship, save what I do
myself. Now, gentlemen, we are losing a fair wind; we must on
board. Justice shall be done, even to such a picaroon as
this."</p>

<p>Janszoon would have spoken, but Jacobs restrained him. And,
with Lants securely guarded, they embarked for the Roebuck,
which, meanwhile, had stood in nearer the land.</p>

<p>The instant Dampier's foot touched the deck he beckoned to his
chief mate, and ordered him to call to quarters. Then he turned,
and ordered the prisoner to be brought before him. Speaking in
English, which Lants understood well, he said:</p>

<p>"I acknowledge your claim to be tried before the high court in
Batavia, for the murder of the sailor, and the attempt to steal
the boat; it is not my business. But it is my business, as King's
officer, to do justice on every notorious pirate who comes in my
clutches. I know enough of you to hang you ten times over; but I
can only do it once unfortunately. Give him a short shrift and a
long rope," he said to the boatswain, and, unheeding the prayers
and curses of the unhappy man, he beckoned Jacobs, and went to
his cabin.</p>

<p>"There way be some things in your boat that you want to
recover, Master Jacobs; you may take a boat's crew and bring them
off, and bring back the dead sailor, and we will give him decent
burial before that rogue is cut down."</p>

<p>As he went over the side, Jacobs cast a look up at the limp
figure swaying at the yardarm with the roll of the ship.</p>

<p>"The sea never takes those that are to be hanged," he said
under his breath.</p>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>6. -- THE KADITCHA</h2>

<h3><i>Australasian</i>, ´Melbourne, 20 July 1907</h3>

<p class="first">
<i>[This story appears to have been condensed from "The
Moccasins of Silence," a novella of some 27,000 words published
in 1896 in hardback. This story is 4,000 words. mdash;TW]</i></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THE heat was something to be for ever remembered, although the
surroundings had nearly as much to do with it as the all-dominant
and overpowering sun&mdash;sand ridges, uniform in direction, red
and fiery in hue and but scantily veiled with the hostile and
venomous spinifex and a few stunted and thinly-foliaged
trees.</p>

<p>A small cavalcade, consisting of three white men, one
blackfellow, and five "ships of the desert," were painfully
tolling across the killing regularity of the sand ridges. When
they reached the crest of one, the party halted, and temporarily
sought refuge, after dismounting, in the most ample apology for
shade that could be found; while t he camels relieved their
wounded feelings by grunting and snarling at each other and the
state of things in general.</p>

<p>The men who dismounted to rest their sun-dazzled eyes
resembled the general run of sojourners in the unoccupied parts
of central Australia. The youngest was a man of over thirty-five
years, who looked as though, when divested of his uncared-for
beard and when the deep tan had faded from his face, he would
resume easily the tall hat and frock coat of civilisation.</p>

<p>"Well, Barrett," he said to an elder with more of the
confirmed bushman about him who had drawn a note-book from his
pouch and was consulting some figures on it "How do we stand
now?"</p>

<p>"Close to it, I think, and if there were any landmarks about,
I could tell our position to a certainty, but this confounded
desert is as flat as a billiard-table when you take the level of
the crown of the ridges. But that ridge which we are about to
tackle looks a shade higher than the others, and we must be about
near the place."</p>

<p>"Let us hope this salt lake will turn up trumps, for our
camels, are done up, negotiating these sand waves."</p>

<p>"The lake is always dry," said Barrett, "It is only a courtesy
title, but the niggers say that the little soak close to it at
this end never fails them. Hope they're right."</p>

<p>The third man, who had not yet spoken, and seemed a little
inferior in station to the other two; here broke in, "We'd better
he making a start, Mr. Glendower; old Sir Hack-a-rib is getting
to look uncommonly ugly, and beginning to blow bladders, as if he
meant to play up if he doesn't get water soon."</p>

<p>"Right, Joe!"</p>

<p>Wearily the men remounted, and again emerged into the full
force of the blistering heat, now augmented by the rising of a
hot wind. Barrett led the line, as they descended the slope of
the ridge and commenced to ascend the one opposite. By the time
they had reached the top the hot wind was terrible, and it was as
much as the camels could do to struggle to the crest. Once there,
Barrett waved his hand, exclaiming, "There's the lake."</p>

<p>The so-called lake was but a distant sheen of white,
glistening salt; an elongated arm of which wound and twisted
almost to the foot of the ridge that they had just painfully
surmounted. A lake! To call it by such a name was worse than
mockery&mdash;it was sheer blasphemy. A lake should thing that
suggested the deep and cool repose of sleeping water, dark
shadows wavering and shimmering under o'er-hanging, green leaves,
that trailed and dipped and kissed the surface when the
wind&mdash;not a hot wind&mdash;rustled and played with them.</p>

<p>This lake threw back the glaring heat that smote its burnished
front with more painful refraction than did the red sand-dunes;
but it was the lake they were bound for, and Barrett led the
caravan towards the nearest end of it.</p>

<p>The heat that radiated from the bare surface of encrusted salt
struck them with unrelenting wrath and fierceness as they rode
on, and they were just upon the edge of a hollow that merged its
dry channel into the lake, when Barrett stopped suddenly, and
gave an exclamation of astonishment.</p>

<p>A few paces in front of him, on the bare hot sand, lay the
corpse of a black fellow. They dismounted, and gathered round.
The native had seemingly died of thirst: he was making for the
soak, and finding it dry, had laid down to die. He had been dead
not many hours, but already the oven-like blast of the wind had
commenced its shrivelling work.</p>

<p>"This looks bad for us," said Barrett, "when even the natives
of the land come to grief."</p>

<p>"He's stuck to his waddy to the bitter end," said Glenlyon,
pointing to a formidable club the dead hand still grasped; "but
what is he carrying his dancing-pumps for; what are they for?" he
asked, turning to Barrett.</p>

<p>Joe stooped and took from the back of the corpse a pair of
slippers, apparently, that had hung round his neck with some
native string. He handed them to Barrett with a look of
intelligence.</p>

<p>"Kaditcha," he said.</p>

<p>"And what the mischief do you mean by Kaditcha?" asked
Glenlyon.</p>

<p>Joe, who did not seem a man of many words, said
briefly&mdash;"Why murder shoes; but he'll tell you."</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, Barrett took up the task of explaining the
problem.</p>

<p>"Certainly they were his dancing-pumps, which he carried to
hide the fall of his fairy footsteps when he stole upon his
sleeping enemy to hit him on the head with that big club he was
so burdened with. He'll never do it again, and it looks as though
we shall share the same fate!"</p>

<p>"Are the treacherous things common?"</p>

<p>"No; not very; they are principally used by the blacks of the
McDonnell Ranges, not far to the eastward of here. The blacks of
the spinifex desert, away to the nor'-west, wear shoes, too; but
theirs are harmless ones made of plaited spinifex to shield the
soles of the feet from the burning sand."</p>

<p>"What are these made of then?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you by and by, if we live; but we must see about
what is the best thing to do in this fix. There's no water to be
got in this soak. See." He pointed with the last word to the
dried-up remains of innumerable birds that lay about, and amongst
them the corpse of a dingo, with the wild dog snarl still curling
its lip.</p>

<p>"Well, we have plenty of water still left for ourselves; but
the camels will never manage to get back to the last water; it's
nearly a hundred and fifty miles away. Joe, there's the soak down
there; have a look, and see if there is any chance to clean it
out."</p>

<p>Joe unstrapped the shovel from where it was carried handy on
one of the packs, and strolled off on his errand. Presently his
tread was heard returning.</p>

<p>"Blacks been following it down already, and found it as dry as
a bone," was his laconic comment.</p>

<p>There was a somewhat moody silence for a time; then Barrett,
who had been intently watching the camels, and particularly
Sennacherib, who was busily browsing on something, and looking
uncommonly bland and smiling, suddenly said: "Blessed if there
isn't a chance of our pulling through after all."</p>

<p>"Sennacherib find 'em Parakheelia," said the blackboy, at the
same time.</p>

<p>"What's all this?" asked Glenlyon.</p>

<p>"Parakheelia growing about here," said Barrett. "It's a plant
that's as good as a drink to camels, and old Sennacherib has
spotted it already. Bully for the evil-tempered old cuss."</p>

<p>"Let's camp here, then," said Glenlyon. "Let them get a
bellyful if it does them any good."</p>

<p>"Does them any good, my dear fellow? It's saved their lives,
and ours too. It's a wonderful plant, although it looks so
insignificant. We'll camp here all night, a bit away from that
dead nigger, though."</p>

<p>"I'll take the shoes of murder first. I'll take them down to
Melbourne as a curiosity."</p>

<p>"Oh, they have some there; that's where I first heard about
them."</p>

<p>After selecting a suitable spot, they unpacked and formed a
camp, and over a pipe Barrett told all be knew about the
Kaditcha.</p>

<p>"The accepted notion is that they are used for the purpose of
secret murder. D'ye see how cunningly they are made without heel
or toe; alike at both ends, so that there is no track left to
show the direction the wearer has gone; and, as for being
noiseless, no list suppers are anywhere near them. The uppers are
woven of human hair, and the soles of dry grass caked with gum
and human blood, with a dressing of emu feathers. What the dead
owner was doing with them so far from the range I don't
know."</p>

<p>That night the camels had a satisfactory feed, and, in a day
or two, got safely back to the little camp from which they had
started on their prospecting trip.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
IT was Cup Day in Melbourne, a brilliant cup it had been, too;
the weather had been all that could be desired, and the ring had
been hit hard, for the favourite had won.</p>

<p>In the crowded street, one of Melbourne's leading
thoroughfares, two men met each other with a glad note of pleased
surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, Barrett, I'm as glad to see you as I was when the
favourite flew past the post first. Never expected you would tear
yourself away from that lovely country."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've sold out very well, and am going to have a bit of a
spell; think I deserve it."</p>

<p>"By Jove, you do," returned Glenlyon. "We must have a yarn
about old times, and that devil of a trip we had together. When
will you come out and have dinner, my wife knows you well by
repute, and will be delighted to know you personally. Gad, she
looks upon you as a second Livingstone."</p>

<p>As Barrett laughingly protested at this estimate, another man
sauntered up and accosted Glenlyon, who greeted him in return
cordially. A few words only had been interchanged, when the
newcomer turned to Barrett, remarking he had had the pleasure of
meeting him once. To this Barrett returned a cold
acknowledgement. But Glenlyon, noticed nothing strange in his
manner, and rattled on&mdash;"So glad you fellows are old
friends, now look here, you and Carlisle, come out and have
dinner on Thursday. Settling-day, I've won a pot of money to-day,
and you must come and have a feed, and stay the night to
signalise the event. Consider it settled&mdash;good-bye till
then, Carlisle. I must Lave a bit of a chat with Barrett."</p>

<p>"Where on earth did you pick up that fellow Carlisle?" asked
Barrett, when they were done.</p>

<p>"Carlisle? Oh, he's a first-rate fellow, only he's rather out
of luck just now. Must have lost more than he knows how to pay
over the races to-day. That's why I asked him out; besides, I
don't want to seem cold to him, for he was a one-time pretender
to my wife's hand. She can't stand the sight of him. But I feel
sorry for him, specially now that he's been hit so hard."</p>

<p>"Well," said dogged Barrett. "I confess I wouldn't trust the
man as far as I could sling him. There were some worse than shady
stories about him up north, where I knew him. I'm not a married
man, but I'll bet your wife's instinct is right, and I'd go
against it."</p>

<p>But Glenlyon's cheery nature rejected the idea, and he changed
the subject, with a parting toast to the memory of
Sennacherib.</p>

<p><br>
ON the appointed afternoon Barrett found himself at Glenlyon's
pretty villa. He had been asked early, in order to make the
acquaintance of his friend's wife, and was soon enjoying the chat
with his hostess. The liking was mutual, and Barrett found
himself telling her all the details of their northern
journey.</p>

<p>"Oh, those horrible murder shoes! My husband has them still,
but I must insist on his getting rid of them. Do you know, Mr.
Barrett, It may be gross superstition on my part, but I believe
that there is an uncanny influence about those shoes. If a man
wore them I feel convinced he would be irresistibly impelled to
murder somebody, if he was inclined that way. I shall never be
happy till they are out of the place."</p>

<p>"I know many people about the part where they used," replied
Barrett, "who have just the same feelings about them. Why that
man, Joe Keating, who was with us when we got them, as good a
blackfellow as ever lived, has since been murdered by a native
wearing similar slippers."</p>

<p>"Oh, how awful! Walter shall not keep them another hour. I
wouldn't sleep other night in the house with the fatal
things."</p>

<p>During dinner, the conversation tended towards the outside
experience of Glenlyon and his friend in Central Australia, and
Barrett took the opportunity of telling his host about Joe
Keeting's death.</p>

<p>Glenlyon was greatly moved by the news, especially when he
learned of the details of the murder. "Now, Walter," said his
wife, "I have often mentioned my aversion to those murder-shoes
you preserve so carefully, I insist on your making a bonfire of
them."</p>

<p>Glenlyon rose abruptly, and said, "I will fetch them at once,
and we will burn them after dinner; they would always be assorted
with poor Keeting's murder."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mrs. Glenlyon," said Carlisle. "Will you allow me
to take over the seemingly fatal responsibility of their custody?
I have a small collection of native curios, and they would be a
great addition to it."</p>

<p>When Glenlyon returned with the Kaditcha, his wife
said&mdash;"Mr. Carlisle has put in plea for them, and he can
have them, as long as he takes them away with him, and never see
them again."</p>

<p>Carlisle took the shoes from his host, and said&mdash;"Your
unfortunate friend must have roused the revengeful feelings of
the blacks for some, probably, unintentional wrong. I believe
these shoes are used when tribal injuries are avenged."</p>

<p>"No," exclaimed Barrett, somewhat tartly. "Keeting never did
an ill-turn to blacks&mdash;on the contrary, for a man in his
position he was exceptionally kind and humane to all he came in
contact with. As we learnt afterwards, he was the victim of a
mistake. The blackfellow who stalked and killed him unawares
mistook him for a man known up there as Jim Dawson, who was noted
for his inhumanity, and to tell the truth would have deserved
whatever he got."</p>

<p>Carlisle glanced at the speaker with a kind of deadly hatred,
but restrained himself. Glenlyon looked uncomfortable, and his
wife, whose eyes had been intently fixed upon Carlisle, rose to
leave, saying, "The conversation is getting too horrible for me;
perhaps after a cigar you will find a less gruesome subject."</p>

<p>She gave an unobserved motion to Barrett, who sprang and
opened the door for her. As she went out she said to him in an
undertone, "Are Carlisle and Dawson the same man?"</p>

<p>Barrett nodded, closed the door, and resumed his seat.</p>

<p>There was an awkward silence for a while, then Carlisle
spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>"I presume you meant me when you made that remark just now, Mr
Barrett. I thought you and Glenlyon were acquainted with the
reasons that I have for resuming my own name, as well as those
for using the name of Dawson for a brief time, but I was unaware
that I had earned such calumny while so doing."</p>

<p>"I must apologise to you and Mr. Glenlyon," said Barrett to
his host. "But the feeling of friendship I had for Keeting must
be my excuse&mdash;men feel strongly in the outside country. It
you have been slandered, Mr. Carlisle, I am glad to hear that the
stories of your cruelty to the blacks are false; they are
certainly widely repeated in the north."</p>

<p>"Let it pass at that," said Glenlyon. "I am sure Barrett meant
no intentional offence. Those Kaditchas seem indeed to breed
trouble."</p>

<p>The incident dropped, and the men finished their cigars in
outward amity.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
AN unseasonably cool night had succeeded a hot day, but
Barrett tossed and tumbled, unable to sleep. This was an unusual
mood to afflict him. As a rule he was a sound and healthy
sleeper, and, at last, he rose to seek the bushman's solace of a
pipe of tobacco. But his long-tried friend had been left in the
room where they had been Bitting, and he had nothing in the
bedroom. He thought for a moment, and decided that, as everybody
in the house was sleeping soundly this cool night, ne would
chance making a noise, and go and Seek it. The more he thought of
it, the more desirable did it seem, until, at last, ne had fully
persuaded himself that he could not exist without a pipe.</p>

<p>A distant clock struck two as he opened his door, and passed
into the dark passage. "I wish I had the Kaditchas on," he
thought, as he lingered for a moment, and reflected that even
bare feet made a very audible tread, in the utter stillness.
Suddenly, he experienced a strange thrill, as if some unseen
figure had passed him, and, with a start, he stepped out, and
turned towards the head of the stairway. There was a window on
the next landing, and again he shuddered, for, surely, a dim and
noiseless shadow had flitted between him and the light. He
recovered his nerve in an instant, and, inclined to smile at his
folly, he moved to the head of the staircase, end commenced
carefully to descend. Again in the hall the queer feeling
attacked him that a hostile figure was moving without sound ahead
of him, but the hall was exceptionally dark, and he could see
nothing.</p>

<p>Moving cautiously along, fearful that he would suddenly wake
every echo by stumbling against something, he thought himself of
the exact position of the smoking-room. Yes, right at the end of
the right-hand side, and opposite was the room which Glenlyon
used as his office. Then he paused in a start of amazement. The
unmistakable sound of a key cautiously inserted into a keyhole
caught his ear.</p>

<p>His courage returned with the sudden beat of his heart. This
was no shadowy being from another world, but a flesh and blood
burglar, who had no terrors for him. A streak of pale light was
visible for an instant, and Was then obscured, the silent visitor
had entered the office and closed the door. Many thoughts crowded
into Barrett's mind. Glenlyon had told him that he had a
considerable sum of money in the house that night, and had left
it in the desk in his office. His late winnings and some other
money were there.</p>

<p>Carlisle, the man who was on the brink of ruin, was after
it.</p>

<p>Evidently he must be desperate, for, as Barrett thought the
matter hastily over, he comprehended how, equipped with the
silent shoes of murder, he must have bad the audacity to enter
Glenlyon's bedroom, and take the keys from the toilet-table
without disturbing either of the sleepers. There was no longer
any necessity for caution: the more noise the better.</p>

<p>In two or three quick steps, Barrett had reached the door and
thrown it open. There was a large window in the room and a street
light opposite, so the surroundings of the room could easily be
seen. Carlisle was standing at the open desk, paralysed at the
interruption.</p>

<p>"Bowled out," said Barrett, and advanced upon him.</p>

<p>"It's you, it is?" returned the other, recognising the hated
voice. "Look here, Barrett, I'm desperate: there's more than ruin
hanging to this. I'm in a corner, and I'll fight. Stand off, for
I'm armed."</p>

<p>Not answering a word, Barrett closed with him immediately.
Both men were well matched, and clothed only in their pyjama
suits. But to Barrett there was a weird unreality about the
struggle, for his adversary's feet made no noise, whilst his own
stampings were noisy enough and resounded through the silent
house. It was almost like wrestling with a ghost, but a most
substantial one. Carlisle was armed with a sheath knife, while
Barrett was, of course, just as he had jumped out of bed. Barrett
had fast hold of the man's wrists, and, although he had received
one or two slight scratches, he felt that he could hold him until
assistance came, in spite of his frenzied efforts to get
away.</p>

<p>They were locked together when the door opened, and Glenlyon
and his wife appeared with a light. Both were in their night
dresses, and had evidently been aroused by the alarming sounds of
the fight. The conflict stopped, and Barrett, releasing his
grasp, allowed the baffled thief to draw back. Then there was a
minute's silence, broken by the loud panting of the
combatants.</p>

<p>"Good God, Carlisle!" said Glenlyon, when he had taken the
scene in.</p>

<p>"Yes. I was going to take your money; but this man stopped me,
and now there's nothing left for me but revenge, and I mean to,
have it, too." What with shame and rage the man was mad for the
time being.</p>

<p>"I don't like talking to a man with a knife in his hand,"
returned Glenlyon. "Hand it over; that's better."</p>

<p>Mrs. Glenlyon slipped hastily out of the room. When she
returned, having donned a dressing-gown, the heated feelings had
somewhat cooled down.</p>

<p>"I shall not prosecute you," her husband was saying. ''The
disgrace and ruin that, according to your own showing, are
awaiting you, will be bad enough, and punishment enough in all
conscience. Clear out as soon as it is daylight, and don't let us
set eyes on you again?'</p>

<p>"And don't forget to take the murder shoes with you," added
Mrs. Glenlyon.</p>

<p>Carlisle disappeared, and the one or two frightened servants
who had been huddled outside the door were hunted back to bed.
After bandaging the one or two slight knife cuts that Barrett had
received in the fray, the rest retired to their rooms to resume
their interrupted slumbers, Glenlyon first bestowing the cash in
a safer place.</p>

<p><br>
SIX months had passed away, and Glenlyon and his wife were
seated at their breakfast, Glenlyon, man-like, taking his with
his newspaper. Suddenly he uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Connie, it is impossible!"</p>

<p>His wife sprang up and went to look over his shoulder:
together they read the announcement:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
News just to hand by the mailman is to the effect that a
treacherous murder has been committed at Arconwatta. The victim
is a well-known and popular mine-owner of the name of William
Barrett, owner of the battery just erected at the Sennacherib
mining claim, from which there has been lately such wonderful
returns. The unfortunate victim was evidently murdered in his
sleep, and a horrible detail is the fact that the murderer had
evidently adopted native tactics and muffled his approach with
the silent shoes or kaditchas of the blacks, a discarded pair
being found at the murdered man's door. Two thousand ounces of
gold were taken.</p>

<p class="quote">Later.&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">
A clue to the murderer has, it is thought, been discovered,
as the kaditchas have men recognised as having been seen in the
possession of a man who is well known. There is only one
policeman on the place, but about a dozen smart bushmen have
volunteered, and are now on the tracks of the suspected man,
whose capture is only considered a matter of time.</p>

<br>

<p>"Capture him I hope they will," said Mrs. Glenlyon, "and hang
him with those horrible shoes round his neck."</p>

<p>But the judgment that fell on the wretched man was less
merciful than that of hanging. The avengers of blood found him
dead, with the gold still beside him. He had died of thirst, for
when he found the hole he was making for was dry he dared not
turn back, but to the last struggled on, hugging the stolen
gold.</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>7. -- THE BLACK WATERHOLE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 30 Nov 1895</h3>

<p class="first">
'THE story of the Black Waterhole,' said Tom Donovan, 'is
firmly believed in by every man, woman, and child around that
part, I don't say but what I feel inclined to put some faith in
it myself. However, I'll tell you the truth of it, and you can
judge for yourselves, only all I tell you has been well
authenticated.</p>

<p>'The Black Waterhole is on the Koramang River; a rare old
place about there for the worst kind of selectors. Smart fellows
the youngsters are, too, so far as regards the bush, but as
ignorant of the outer world as it is possible for any one to be
at the end of the nineteenth century. The only books they read
are the penny cowboy and detective novels, and they implicitly
believe that such fustian heroes really exist in America.</p>

<p>'One day one of these budding Premiers of Federated Australia
was fishing in the Black Waterhole when he saw something rise up
out of the water and look at him. Look at him hard, with such a
look that his heart sank down to his belt and his knees got what
he called the 'ager' in them&mdash;meaning ague. However, he was
able to cut and run for it, which he did. When asked to describe
the appearance he could not do so. It was a man's head&mdash;it
was a calf's head&mdash;it was a snake's head&mdash;here somebody
asked if it was not a donkey's head; but the matter was too
serious for joking, for the Black Waterhole was one of the best
holes in the river, and if that was haunted it would be a bad
look-out.</p>

<p>'At last some bold spirits volunteered to go and recover the
fishing line, and four started. Three stopped behind for various
reasons, so the fourth found himself alone when, he reached the
waterhole, and did not fancy the position at all. However, he
took his courage in both hands, and proceeded, to pull the line
up. Something was on the end, probably a turtle; but when he
hauled it up he saw something that he dared not touch. It was the
hand of a man&mdash;such a hand! It had come away from the arm at
the wrist; it was bleached and rotten and corrupted,
but&mdash;and the young fellow noticed it at once&mdash;the hand
was clenched round the line. The hook had not caught by chance in
this awful hand. But the dead hand had clutched the line, and
become detached from the body.</p>

<p>'The young fellow kept his nerve, and walked home holding the
ghastly thing by the line. Arrived there the neighbors assembled
to hear has tale, and the youthful hero told it with many
embellishments. How he felt the hand haul at the line, and then
pull hard against him, etc.</p>

<p>'"The police will have to be informed," said old Philaster.
"There's a body in that hole where the hand came from."</p>

<p>'"Let it stop there," returned a neighbor; "we don't want the
police poking about here for days, prying into things that don't
concern them."</p>

<p>"'That's true," echoed several others. But old Philaster
insisted that the police must be informed, otherwise it would
look suspicious if the thing leaked out, which it was sure to do,
sooner or later.</p>

<p>'So the police were informed, and the drowned hand, still
clutching the line, passed over to them. Then the highly
disagreeable of task of searching for the body was proceeded
with, and the horrid thing at last found, brought ashore, and
recognised by the young fisherman as the horror that rose up out
of the water and stared at him.</p>

<p>'Now came the question, who was the deceased, and how did he
come in the waterhole? And that question neither the police nor
any one else was able to answer.</p>

<p>'It was three years afterwards, and, things about the Black
Waterhole had much altered for the better. The selections had
been fenced for the most part; and the face of the country, on
account of the clearing of the timber, entirely altered in
appearance.</p>

<p>'Two troopers with a prisoner rode to the Black Waterhole one
midday, and turned out for a short spell. The man was a horse
thief, who had been caught after a long chase; they put leg irons
on him as soon as he dismounted.</p>

<p>'When they had prepared their food, and given him some with a
pannikin of tea, he looked tip.</p>

<p>'"What place do you call this?" he asked, sullenly.</p>

<p>'"The Black Waterhole," answered one of the tippers, shortly,
for their prisoner was not a man to rouse their sympathy.</p>

<p>'"The Black Waterhole," he repeated. "The country was
different when I was here last."</p>

<p>'"Yes. Three of us camped here about four years ago, and one
is here still. No, thanky, no tea for me," and he emptied the
pannikin on the ground.</p>

<p>'"What's the meaning of this?" asked the trooper.</p>

<p>'"Leary's dead, I believe, so I can do him no harm if I tell
the story. When we camped here I was mortal sick, and that was
the reason we stopped two days here camped, for I could not ride.
Leary was a swell, down on his luck, and Bardie was the same;
both had come up country for a spell to get away from their debts
in town, I suppose. I had been breaking, and we met accidentally,
and travelled together.</p>

<p>'"In the afternoon of the day we stopped here they had, a row,
and came to blows, but Bardie was much the better man, and the
fight did not last long, but I was too weak to interfere. It was
something about a woman, I think. Next morning, after we had had
breakfast, I got up to try and use my legs a bit. Bardie was
sitting on the bank fishing, and as I staggered up I saw Leary
sneak up behind, and suddenly shove him in the river. Bardie
could not swim, and when I saw that it was murder I crept behind
a tree, for I knew Leary would not let me live if he knew I had
witnessed it. I suppose in his struggles Bardie got further away
from the bank, for, presently I saw Leary pick up a big stone and
hurl it at something in the water; then he commenced to run up
and down the bank, calling to me. When I came up he shouted,
'Bardie is drowning; he fell into the lagoon, and I can't
swim.'</p>

<p>'"I'm too weak to go in," I said.</p>

<p>Just then Bardie came up for the last time, looking awful.</p>

<p>'"Do something," cried Leary; "throw him the fishing line," I
took the line the man-had been using, and he caught it, but as
soon as we put a strain on it, it broke, and he went down, for
good.</p>

<p>'There was a pause.</p>

<p>'"That's not the end of it," said the trooper.</p>

<p>'"So far as I am concerned, it is," replied the prisoner.</p>

<p>'"What became of Leary?"</p>

<p>'"He went to Coolgardie with the first rush, and I heard died
of fever. We parted as soon as possible, you bet."</p>

<p>'"Bardie has been out of that hole some three years, and it
has been; flooded half a dozen times since, so you can drink your
tea."</p>

<p>'"How was he found?" asked the prisoner.</p>

<p>'"He caught hold of a boy's fishing line, and his hand came
off, and came up holding on to the line. Then they found the
body."</p>

<p>'The prisoner stared at him with a white face.</p>

<p>'"It's true," went on the trooper; "the hand catching the line
is in spirits in Sydney. But you have solved the mystery, and if
you make a proper confession when we get in, and give a good
description of Leary, it may do you good. Leary may not be dead,
after all."</p>

<p><br>
'LEARY was very much alive, and had done well at Coolgardie.
He was back in Sydney under another name, swelling round the
bars. He was tracked down without much difficulty, for he had a
tattoo mark on his hand, made when he was a boy at sea.</p>

<p>'One day the inspector who had the warrant for his arrest, and
had purposely made friends with him, remarked to him that, if he
would walk as far as the Central, he had a curious thing to show
him. Leary complied, and when there the inspector took him into a
room where, on a small scale, there; was a museum like that of
Scotland! Yard.</p>

<p>'"What do you think of this?" he asked, holding up the glass
jar containing the hand, from the Black Waterhole.</p>

<p>'Leary fell back, every line in his face crying guilt.</p>

<p>'"His hand," he murmured. "Bardie's hand!" and the next minute
the handcuffs were on him.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>8. -- THE GREAT TREASURE LOBSTER</h2>

1897</h3>

<h3>PART I</h3>

<img src="2300041h-images/StoriesVol2-1.png"
style="float:left"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">

<p class="first">
LIFE on a trepang fishing station is not by any means a round
of delirious excitement; the weeks follow one another in a
certain monotonous manner, your only relaxation being quarrelling
with your mate. My partner was a man named Campbell, whom you
could not quarrel with, for the simple reason that he was so
dogmatically sure or everything that he could not conceive the
possibility of anybody differing from him.</p>

<p>Our station was on the inner edge of the Great Barrier Reef,
in the neighborhood of what is known on the chart as No. X
Island. Campbell, myself, two South Sea Island boys, and half a
dozen mainland blacks constituted the inhabitants of our little
world of sand and coral. Collecting the slugs, drying and smoking
them, was our occupation, varied by an occasional trip into
Cooktown with our stuff for shipment to China. At low water we
had leagues of shallow reefs around us; and at high water we
lived in the midst of a pale green sea.</p>

<p>Things had been exceptionally dull some time, and I was
seriously thinking telling Campbell that Bobbie Burns was
inferior to Shakespeare, in order to rouse him into argument when
a strange event happened.</p>

<p>A little to the south of us was a break in the reef, one known
as the Pandora Passage, and at low water you could go to the
inlet and watch the tide racing out to the Pacific. One morning I
saw Campbell coming from the direction of this inlet in company
with one of the kanaka boys, carrying a good-sized piece of
timber. He put It down on the sand with a slightly defiant air,
and said, 'What do you make of that?'</p>

<p>I examined the piece of wood, and remarked that it was a very
old portion of a ship.</p>

<p>'And you see nothing else?' said Campbell in a superior
tone.</p>

<p>I looked again, but had to confess that I saw nothing but a
commonplace piece of timber. Campbell snorted and made an
insulting remark about blockheads, and then drew my attention to
the way in which the timber had been severed or cut in two.</p>

<p>It certainly was strange. The wood, and very old seasoned wood
it was, had been torn asunder as though by some terrific force
far beyond what I could just then comprehend. If a giant had
taken the baulk up and snapped it across his knee it would have
explained the way in which the timber had been treated.</p>

<p>'It is very remarkable,' I said, rather feebly.</p>

<p>'Remarkable,' echoed Campbell, 'can you explain how it was
done, and what sort of creature did it. Why, man, the force used
in severing that piece of timber would have built the
Pyramids.'</p>

<p>We stood contemplating the wood without saying anything; it
certainly was a very curious sort of thing to be cast up on the
Barrier Reef.</p>

<p>'This is not the first piece that has been stranded,' remarked
Campbell at last, 'and they have all got the same devil's mark
upon them.'</p>

<p>'What wood is it?'</p>

<p>'Oak, to all appearance, but it has been a long time in the
sea.'</p>

<p>It was some time afterwards that Campbell, whom this derelict
seemed to trouble, proposed that we should take a trip to the
outer edge of the Great Barrier; we could follow the Pandora
Passage in our dinghy, and there was a bit of a sand bank there
that we could camp on for the night.</p>

<p>I agreed, for we had nothing very much to do just then, and
accordingly we started. The trip was not an interesting one to
men who spent their time on an island of about ten acres but it
was full of interest before we came back.</p>

<p>On the outer edge of the reef was the island I
mentioned&mdash;a long, narrow strip of sand, with some low
bushes growing on the highest part of it. Right alongside this
island, on the northern side ran the passage; deep and abrupt,
just a gap in a wall of coral. We had been taking things
leisurely, and it was evening when we reached the island. I took
the boat round into a quiet pool and amused myself fixing camp,
and Campbell went strolling along the beach.</p>

<p>Suddenly he called to me. I found him looking at some peculiar
marks in the soft coral sand.</p>

<p>'Man!' he exclaimed, 'what's that?'</p>

<p>That was more than I could answer. The tracks were deep and
dragging, as though, if such a thing were possible, a traction
engine had run over the island. But they were not wheel tracks;
more as if some extraordinary bird had been stalking about with
mammoth tread, and digging his feet in as far as he possibly
could.</p>

<p>'Now what sort of a mermaid is that?' said Campbell.</p>

<p>I could not say. If there existed one lovely spot in the world
one should have thought it was where we were then standing. The
tide was full, and the surf breaking to a long line north and
south of us. To the east was the ocean an ocean that seldom saw a
ship. Yet, strange to say, something had been wandering about
that island, and something that made tracks different from
anything mortal that I had seen before.</p>

<p>'I give it up,' unless its the sea serpent.'</p>

<p>'Sea grandmother,' returned Campbell, 'do you know a serpent's
tracks when you see them?'</p>

<p>'Well what is It then? A gigantic seal might make tracks
something like that, but it isn't a seal, and I am sure I don't
know what it is.'</p>

<p>Campbell said nothing, but looked out to sea, and seemed to be
troubled in his mind about something.</p>

<p>'Look,' he said, suddenly, 'there's a log coming ashore.'</p>

<p>We went down to the water's edge and met the castaway. It was
like the other one, and of old sodden wood, and had been broken
and twisted by the wrenching it had undergone.</p>

<p>'Those are the marks of teeth,' he said 'or something very
like it.'</p>

<p>'I think we had better go back,' I replied. 'If this island is
a place of resort to things of this description they might pay us
a visit to-night&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The very reason we will stop,' replied my mate. 'Surely it's
possible that there may be beings that no man knows of, who come
to the upper air in such lonely out-of-the-way places as this. If
so, we shall see it. A thing who can chew up timber like that
would not be an agreeable companion; however, I'll stop.'</p>

<p>It was nearly sundown, and I went to the bushes to see if I
could get enough dry sticks to make a fire. A couple of birds
rose up as I approached, and I found that, like most of the
Barrier islets, there was a depression containing brackish
water.</p>

<p>But there was something more. Campbell, who had followed me,
gave a gasp of astonishment, and we looked at one another in
amaze. Concealed amongst the bushes, partly in the depression,
was a heap of some sort of curious objects&mdash;masses of metal,
seemingly solidified and fixed into angular blocks. There were
also casks and kegs, and the remnants of planks, and beams; but
what we saw, and what caused us to gasp with wonder, was the fact
that these masses of metal were composed of coin&mdash;gold and
silver so kneaded together that they looked like solid
blocks.</p>

<p>The sun set whilst we were examining them, but there was no
doubt now about our staying the night.</p>

<p>'How did they come here?' was the question we asked each
other, but could not answer.</p>

<p>Evidently the treasure had been stored there by somebody, and
was not the result of a wreck, for no ship could have been cast
up as high as was the little belt of bushes that concealed the
treasure.</p>

<p>Naturally we did not sleep very soon, and sat up long
discussing our strange find, until it must have been nearly
midnight. Then I dropped off to sleep, but only to be awakened a
few hours later by Campbell shaking me.</p>

<p>A dying moon had just risen, giving to light the strange
scene, the waste of shallow water, the line of tossing foam, and
the strip of sand we were resting on.</p>

<p>'Beames,' said Campbell, 'come here.'</p>

<p>He led me down to where the deep channel flowed past the
island. 'Did you ever see the moon under the sea?'</p>

<p>I followed the direction of his finger, and truly there was a
strange and wonderful light deep down in the water. What the
marvellous thing was I could not tell, but it was there, fathoms
below us and seemingly full of life. It flashed and twinkled as
we watched it, and then suddenly went out.</p>

<p>'What can it be, Campbell?' I asked.</p>

<p>'How can I know? I shall be glad when it is daylight.'</p>

<p>'So shall I,' I replied, and though it was a fairly sultry
night I shivered.</p>

<p>'Suppose we start back,' I suggested, 'and then bring the boys
with us to cart that money away.'</p>

<p>'Why if they saw that light down there all the gold in the
world wouldn't hold them. No; we will try to find out what it is
in the morning. Goodness! Look at it now.'</p>

<p>Suddenly the submarine light had blazed out again&mdash;blazed
out with a far greater brilliancy than it had done before. It
seemed to illumine the depths of the sea beneath us, and we saw
shooting streaks across its beams as though shoals of frightened
fish were dashing past. We could do nothing but gaze at this
wonderful thing, but suddenly there was a new development. A lot
of shimmering spots seemed to detach themselves, from the main
body of light and rise up towards us. Up they came, growing
brighter, brighter as they seared the surface, and then, with a
dazzling glow they burst, and the steady light only remained.</p>

<p>'I think we'll go and sit in the boat till daylight,' said
Campbell; and though I did not sea how that would improve
matters, I followed him across the sand, to where our dinghy was
moored.</p>

<p>'It must be connected with that treasure,' I remarked when we
reached the boat, which felt homelike, at any rate. 'But how can
such a light exist down that depth?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, but we'll find out, please goodness, when
daylight comes.'</p>

<p>Immediately he spoke the surface of the ocean seemed lit up
with a wonderful glow, almost as though it had caught fire. Right
at the place where we had been standing watching the strange
appearance rose a brilliant and blinding sun. As we stared at it
dazzled and dazed, it suddenly vanished, and although the moon
was shining it seemed as though black darkness had suddenly
fallen over everything. When we had recovered our sight, we were
not alone on the islet.</p>

<p>Out from the sea emerged a long, cylindrical body, dark
coloured, and about twenty feet in length. It glistened in the
moonlight, and the drops of sea water rained down from it in a
shower as it came slowly on to the beach. This object had legs,
on which it travelled, somewhat clumsily, but steadily, but what
made me feel queer, and Campbell the same, was that the being,
whatever It was, had a huge pair of formidable nippers, or
mandibles. As though a lobster had suddenly shot up into
tremendous proportions.</p>

<p>'That's what tore the timber up,' chattered Campbell, and I
quite sympathised with him, for my heart was banging against my
ribs. Fancy the position&mdash;a little patch of sand, no shelter
or cover, and this monster slowly approaching in the ghostly
moonlight.</p>

<p>It was bad enough in all conscience, but suddenly it was
worse, for the brilliant light shot out again from the front of
the creature, blinding us entirely. I gave myself up for lost,
and expected every minute to feel those awful nippers embracing
me, for we had to shut our eyes and trust to chance. However,
nothing came of it, and then I dared to open my eyes once
more&mdash;the light was gone, and I could see again.</p>

<p>We were now fairly cornered; whatever the thing was, it had us
completely at its mercy, for there was evidently no good in
running away, so perforce we stood our ground.</p>

<p>In its jaws, If you can call it so, the creature held a box or
case of some sort; it advanced with this towards the bushes, and
we heard it crashing through them. Presently came a long wailing
noise, like the sigh of a lost nation; and then, I don't know how
Campbell felt, but I knew what was blue funk for once in my life,
for the monster turned round and came directly for us, and the
blaze and glare of the brilliance it emitted left me powerless
and helpless. We had backed as far as the water, and could not go
much further without the risk of being taken by sharks, but
fortunately the thing stopped of its own accord, and again there
was the long wailing sigh.</p>

<p>I said 'goodbye!' I don't know why, but it seemed the right
thing to say on the occasion, and then, thank goodness, that
awful searching light went out.</p>

<h3>PART II</h3>

<p class="first">HE bright light that had blinded us so died
out, but there was still a sort of glow 'hovering about', the
strange being, enough to show its fantastic outline and the
horrible lobster-like claws. A voice came from the interior of
it, but what it was we could not exactly determined. At last a
beam of light shot up from the monster's back, and we saw a
figure come out in the radiance and jump down, on the sand.
Campbell grasped my hand, and gave a deep sigh, of relief.</p>

<p>'It's some sort of submarine boat, or diving fake after all;'
and we strode forward to meet, the figure who was advancing
towards us.</p>

<p>'Who are you fellows, and what do you want on my island?'
demanded our visitor, a not very tall but thick-set-looking
man.</p>

<p>'Your island!' I replied. 'If at comes to that, what are you.
doing on 'our', island, for we are on our own fishing
ground?'</p>

<p>'Well, I won't argue about it, but just give you five minutes
to clear out, or I'll make mincemeat of you and your boat
too.'</p>

<p>He turned round and was making a step towards the machine,
when Campbell, who had grasped the situation, whipped out his
revolver, and covered Mm. I followed his example, for I saw at
once that if he got into his machine again he was safe and we
were at his mercy.</p>

<p>'Stop,' cried my mate. 'Move a step and we fire.'</p>

<p>The man stopped with a curse. Evidently he was alone, for he
would otherwise have called for assistance.</p>

<p>'Now,' said Campbell, 'we are two to one, and we'll talk a
bit. I suppose we have as much right to that coin as you, when
all's said and done.'</p>

<p>'There's no chance of any more meddling fellows like you
coming knocking around?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Not the slightest.'</p>

<p>'Very well, then,' he said in a different tone. 'I've enough
for you. Put your pistols away.'</p>

<p>He advanced with his hand outstretched, and we returned our
revolvers to their pouches, and all three shook hands. 'My name
is Vowlson, what's your's?' asked the stranger.</p>

<p>'Mine's Beames,' I replied, 'and this is my partner Campbell.
We have a trepang fishing station on the inner edge of the
Barrier.'</p>

<p>'So that accounts for your coming here. I thought I had found
one spot in the world where no one ever came fooling around, but
it appears I made a mistake.'</p>

<p>'We probably should not have come but for finding those chawed
up pieces of wood,' returned Campbell.</p>

<p>'Well now you're here, I suppose you can guess what I am
doing.'</p>

<p>'You've found an old wreck I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Yes; and I'll find a good many more. If you like we'll sit
down and I'll spin you the yarn about any doings, and then you
can come a trip with me. I had a mate, but he's away at present.
Would you like a drink? I suppose you have nothing with you?'</p>

<p>He arose and walked towards his machine. For a moment a
suspicion of foul play darted across me, but I dismissed it at
once. The man's manner was convincingly honest. No doubt he would
have bounced us at first if he could, but failing that he now
seemed to accept the situation.</p>

<p>He ascended his machine, descended through the man-hole, and
came back with a bottle of whisky, and we drank each other's
health. Then, we lit our pipes and, sitting down on the dry sand
with the dim crescent moon lighting up the scene, we listened to
the following story told to the accompaniment of the booming surf
breaking on the outer edge.</p>

<h3>VOWLSON'S STORY</h3>

<p class="first"> 'I DON'T know what first turned my attention so
much to submarine navigation, but it was for a long time an
interesting study with me. By profession I am an engineer, and
always of an experimental bias. Perhaps things worked
unconsciously, but one day there fell into my hands a work upon
sunken wrecks containing treasure, with a list of those known to
be still lying at the bottom of the sea in water too deep to work
in. Then the idea got fast hold of me, and I began my
experiments. I had not much difficulty in the construction of my
design, but the motive power bothered me completely.</p>

<p>'Next I came across a chemist, and we worked together at the
plans. He had money and I had a little, and we kept at it until
we succeeded in most of our purpose, but the motive power still
baffled us. Suddenly Descrants came to one, and for the first
time I saw him excited.</p>

<p>'"I have got the germ of the thing, and time will give me the
remainder," he said.</p>

<p>'He explained to me that the whole discovery had flashed
across him when witnessing some blasting experiments with
dynamite. What we wanted was a force or power that would be
carried in a small compass, and yet capable of generating an
immense degree of strength. Now here was a cartridge of
comparatively insignificant size, capable of rending and
shattering the hardest rock. Could not that power be modified and
made continuous as it were?</p>

<p>'Descrants believed that it could, and persevered until he
succeeded. That success was the final triumph of our invention.
While Descrants had been pursuing his chemical work, I had been
devoting myself to other things, and studying the history of the
world of the last few centuries. I was getting on the track of
lost treasure ships. I got on them too; a fresh lot altogether. I
found out that there was at one time a good deal of traffic
between the west coast of America and the Philippines in plate
and treasure ships. Accident threw in my way some Spanish records
on the subject, and I then found that quite a number of these
vessels had never reached Manilla. What had become of them? I
traced their tracks out over and over again on the map, and at
last hit upon an idea that seemed to offer me a solution of their
fate.</p>

<p>'If so many ships had been lost amongst the Pacific Islands
some traces of them had surely been found, often times. If they
had been driven, far south of their courses where would they have
come; naturally on the unknown east coast of the Great Southland,
or to speak plainly, Australia. But the very part of the coast
which, they would have reached was guarded by the Great Barrier
Reef. On this unseen and dangerous reef they would strike and
founder, and under the Pacific waves at the bottom of the outer
wall of reef there rested, I had no doubt, the remains of many a
stout ship, and, what was more to the purpose, the treasures
they had carried.</p>

<p>'I became entirely enamored of the notion, and the more I
thought of it the more I was convinced that this part of the
world was the right one wherein to try our experiments. Now came
the selection of an island, some seldom visited island on which
to build our machine, or rather put it together. We found to the
northeast of here one that suited our purpose admirably, toeing
sparsely inhabited by only a few families of natives, as we
afterwards found, who served us well as laborers. The machine was
made in small sections, packed in cases and conveyed to Thursday
Island per steamer, thence, we chartered a schooner to the island
in question, and then commenced to put it together.</p>

<p>'This work was not hard for so many models and been made over,
and over again, that I was quite expert in all the details. It
took us three or four months before our treasure-finder was
finished.'</p>

<p><br>
THE morn had dawned while Vowlson was speaking, and he invited
us to come over and inspect 'the lobster,' as Campbell called
it.</p>

<p>The great marine monster stood on six legs and had a
cylindrical body 20 feet long and 5 feet in diameter, made of
corrugated aluminium bronze. There were two thicknesses of this,
and between them was a space which formed the ballast tank for
rising and falling. The thick glass bull's-eye port-holes, placed
at intervals, glared like the eyes of some dead beast. At the top
was another tank for air, which could be used for various
purposes, but what attracted our attention most was the gigantic
and formidable claws.</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>'With the power I possess,' said Vowlson, 'I can exert a
pressure of hundreds of tons with these little nippers. I suppose
you know what they are there for?'</p>

<p>'For tearing down the wrecks, I suppose.'</p>

<p>'Yes, once inside I cannot, of course, come out, but I can
manipulate these claws as if they were my own hands; I can tear
down and destroy anything, and crush it into powder.'</p>

<p>He patted the terrible claws affectionately, and then led us
round the machine.</p>

<p>'It is as strong as a mountain,' he continued, for he was
evidently quite in love with his invention. 'Do you know what the
pressure is down below there at the foot of the reef?'</p>

<p>'Pretty strong, I expect,' replied Campbell.</p>

<p>'About 350lb per square inch; that's why we didn't make our
little beauty any larger, or it might be more comfortable inside
than it is. Isn't it a daisy,' he said, falling back and gazing
with delighted eyes at the grotesque-looking monster. It seemed
to him a great relief to get somebody to talk to, and no wonder!
it must have been pretty lonely down at the bottom of the
reef.</p>

<p>'We'll have some breakfast and I'll finish my story; and you
can inspect the interior.'</p>

<p>He seemed to have grown quite chatty and sociable by this
time, and climbing into his 'beauty' and soon got out a
respectable meal of tinned stuff, and we made some coffee and sat
down and enjoyed it heartily, for Campbell and I had been fasting
pretty hard on the station.</p>

<p>'Where did I leave off?' said Vowlson, when we had finished.
'Oh, just when we had completed the machine on the island. Well,
we set to work experimenting, going down deeper and deeper each
time, and found everything work like clockwork. So being quite
satisfied with the capabilities of our craft, we concealed the
rest or our stores and things, and making the natives' understand
that they were not to tell any 'white men' who called of us or
our belongings, we started for the Great Barrier Reef. I may as
well tell you that though the natives of that island worked well
for us, as soon as the affair was finished and they saw it move,
devil a one would come near it.</p>

<p>'It was calm weather, though that did not matter much, for we,
could always go down if it was rough, and we paddled along easily
and comfortably, sometimes coming to the surface for a look
round. Once we came up close to a steamer, and I bet there's a
sea-serpent story going the rounds of the papers, at present.</p>

<p>'In good time we sighted the Barrier, and, landing at a little
islet something like this, got our position, and prepared for
business. It was a queer feeling for the first time going down
alongside the coral wall&mdash;down, down, with our lights full
on, flashing on all sides. At first we saw many kinds of fishes,
which were not at all scared by us, and once or twice
strange-looking objects, whose nature we could not determine;
peered in through the bull's-eyes. But when we got deeper all
life seemed to vanish. I tell you it's a cold dead world down
there. The reef does not descend altogether vertically, but there
are ledges covered with marine growth and other debris. At the
bottom it was, to our astonishment, quite smooth and
unencumbered&mdash;white coral sand like this we're sitting on,
smooth and hard, with, no sea growth of any sort. Turn our lights
where we would we saw no life of any kind. The dead men who go
down in sunken ships have a quiet residence down there.</p>

<p>'At last we found our first wreck. She had settled down
perfectly upright, and was apparently an old Spanish ship, with
the stumps of three masts still standing. Her decks had been
swept clear of everything, and her bows were smashed and
shattered by the force with which she had been hurled on the
Barrier. We inspected her thoroughly, and after consultation
determined on our mode of proceeding. First we attacked the
high-decked poop, and very soon had that laid bare. Our claws,
which I will show you at work presently, made short work of
everything. It was not long before the inside of the poop was
open to our view. There was nothing in it; ornamentation and
decoration, whatever there once had been, had long since
disappeared. There was nothing there for us.</p>

<p>'We now commenced on the main deck, and ripped it up plank by
plank until all was exposed to our inspection, and we there found
a mass of stuff that had once been cargo of some sort, but now we
could make nothing of it. At last we found where the plate and
other coin was stored, and got out the kegs and barrels, when
they were sound enough, for most of them had rotted and crumbled,
and put them in a row on the bare sand. The plate, mostly silver
coins and silver ingots, we found to have become firmly welded
together, so that even when the kegs and barrels had dropped to
pieces from decay we found ourselves just as well able to handle
them. But you have seen those up there among the bushes, and will
understand what I mean.</p>

<p>'Our next move of course was to come straight up to the
surface, and find out if there was a safe place to deposit our
treasure, for that is the one drawback that I don't see how to
remedy just at present, namely, we could only bring to the
surface two kegs at a time, holding them between the claws. We
took two of the kegs and ascended with them up and up until we
reached the surface, and sprang out into the early morning, and
never did I hail the light so much as when we extinguished our
light and saw the sunbeams glinting on the water. It was calm, so
rising as high out of the water as we could we opened the
manhole, and I scrambled out, and stood on the top. What a
blessed feeling it was to be in the upper world after that
silent, lifeless one below, and I stood inhaling with pleasure
the fresh sea air. The wall, as I told you, slopes outward in
ledges, so we had come up some little distance from the Barrier,
which was visible by the line of surf. No islet was in sight, but
due west I fancied I saw an opening. If so, that would suit us
just as well, as we could deposit the treasure just inside the
outer edge in the first shallow water we came to.</p>

<p>'I descended, and Descrants took my place, and confirmed me in
my notion; so we re-covered the manhole and paddled quietly for
the entrance. It fully answered our expectations, much
resembling this Pandora Passage here, but without any island,
only the reef was bare in patches at low water. Without going
into details, we got all our first lot of treasure up, and
deposited it there, where I think it's pretty safe. Now before I
go on with my story, would you like to come and see the inside of
my little beauty?'</p>

<p>We rose, and followed him.</p>

<p>'This,' said Vowlson, 'is our propelling power both by land
and sea&mdash;these legs. You see they are spatula-shaped at the
end, and on land we walk with them; at sea, and under sea, swim
with them. There are six, and though we don't attain or want to
attain any great rate of speed, as they all work independently,
we can turn rapidly, or get into any position with ease. Now come
in.'</p>

<p>Vowlson climbed in, and we followed. Of course we had to
stoop, but otherwise there was room enough. But what astonished
us was the smallness of the machinery used. This stood in what
might be called the stern-recess, and appeared to be simply three
short, squat pistons, with a crank to each. From this a few pipes
and wires ran round either side of the vessel to the recess
forward, where was the machinery for working the enormous
claws.</p>

<p>'You see,' said Vowlson, 'our motive power might be called
modified nitro-glycerine. In this vessel is nitric acid; in this,
which you see is somewhat larger, is an oily fluid, the nature
of which I am not at liberty to mention, as it is the very
essence of the discovery made by Descrants. These mingle slowly
there at the bottom of these pistons, and explode just as slowly,
driving the engine on much the same principle as a gas engine,
only with this one, small as it looks, we can, if necessary, work
up to 200 horsepower. We use hydraulic power to work the legs and
nippers, and that is a small dynamo for our electric light. The
breathing apparatus is simple&mdash;the one known as the Fleuss
apparatus, and is merely caustic soda to absorb the hydrogen, and
a cylinder of compressed oxygen. Now come forward; and see how
the nippers work. You, perhaps, noticed when you were looking at
them from the outside, that the points were not alike. One is
square, with an angular depression in it; the other pointed; That
is to facilitate breaking articles small enough to grasp without
troubling to put our full tearing power forth.</p>

<p>The machinery to work these enormous jaws seemed of the
simplest, merely a kind of sliding lever. When the shafts of the
jaws came through the front part it was packed with hydraulic
packing; so, too, were the legs. The interior was well padded,
and furnished with racks, instead of shelves.</p>

<p>'Now, will you have a ride round the island?' said
Vowlson.</p>

<p>We agreed, and he went aft and started his machinery, which
emitted nothing louder than a slight continuous crackling noise.
The short, squat pistons rose and fell, then the legs began to
move, and with a jolting sort of gait we made the circuit of the
island. It was not very rough, and sitting athwartships, with our
backs fitting into the rounded sides, not particularly
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>When we stopped at our former position Vowlson opened the
man-hole and we got out again.</p>

<p>'Now,' said Vowlson, 'we'll have dinner. I'll finish my
narrative up to date, and we'll have a chat about future
proceedings. But, first, I'll give you a taste of something that
many a man in Europe would pay for in gold, measured by drops.
Wait for me.'</p>

<p>He returned to the lobster, and brought another bottle and a
wineglass.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately, I have but one glass; but this liquor must not
be drunk out of tin like common whisky.</p>

<p>'Once we found a cask in a wreck&mdash;a cask that was sound
and had resisted decay. When we brought it to, the surface we
discovered that it was full of wine. Wine that had been made in
Spain when, perhaps, the Armada set sail for England, had gone to
the golden shores of Mexico and Peru, and returning again: found
along resting place at the foot of the Great Barrier Reef, one
hundred fathoms deep. We broached the cask of some long dead
hidalgo, and after tasting it filled some bottles to take with
us. Now, drink.'</p>

<p>He poured out a glassful and handed it to me.</p>

<p>Never had I tasted anything like it. The bloom and bouquet of
a hundred vineyards was in it, the sunshine of a hundred summers.
He refilled the glass and handed it to Campbell.</p>

<p>'Man,' he said, when he had finished it, 'worth money, did you
say? Why, that cask means molten gold once away from the Great
Barrier!'</p>

<p>Vowlson laughed, and drank a glass himself.</p>

<p>'Now for dinner,' he said; 'you're nice fishermen for the
Great Barrier not to have some <i>bêche-de-mer</i> soup
ready.'</p>

<p>However, with the tinned stuff and some turtle we had with us,
we had a very merry dinner party, and then we settled down under
the shadow of the grim lobster, which was the only shade on the
island, to hear the end of the yarn.</p>

<p>'After placing the proceeds of the first ship on the reef, we
agreed that, as all our conclusions had turned out so correct, we
must proceed in a more methodical manner. We decided to make a
complete submarine survey of the foot of the reef first, and
locate all wrecks we found, chart them, and then on the surface
we could find the nearest points on which to land anything we
found. Then, of course, it would be all straight ahead work, and
we could convey the stuff to Tiau Island, where we had put the
machine together, where we could call for it at our leisure.</p>

<p>'Down' we went again, and continued our search along the foot
of the reef, systematically plotting it as we went, Somehow we
never grew accustomed to crawling along the bottom of the sea in
that lifeless region&mdash;it got on our nerves. With regard to
wrecks, I may as well tell you we were working from north to
south. We found three more&mdash;one, the one I am working on
here. About fifty miles south of this we sighted a fine ship,
perfectly upright, with all her masts standing. We threw all the
force of the dynamo into our light, and the great hulk of the
ship stood out clear and distinct, the tall masts being lost
aloft in the diminished glow. She had been a ship of the
first-class, high-decked fore and aft; with portholes, with the
mouths of cannons still peering out, and bore no injury save the
ragged rent in her bows that showed that, strong ship as she was,
the Barrier Reef was stronger. It must have been fine weather
when she dashed on to the unknown reef of the south, and sank
immediately.</p>

<p>'We rose and alighted on the main deck, and turned the prow of
the machine towards the entrance doors of the stately poop cabin.
They were wide open, and as we stopped at the doorway, and looked
through the bull's-eyes our intense light lit up the whole of the
interior, as though the lamps in the lofty cabin were all
aglow.</p>

<p>'As yet we had seen no horrors, not a vestige of humanity had
we found in any of the foundered ship's but now. There had been a
gay party assembled at the table when that tall vessel suddenly
sank to the bottom, and they sat there still. But their smiles
had changed to grins, their fleshless bones alone (how held
together I know not) remained of their once brave forms. There
they sat round the table in the stillness of that stagnant,
silent sea, holding high carousal that had lasted centuries. Fair
women might have been once amongst them for aught we could tell;
for all had gone but the grim white skeletons, some of whom still
wore, slackened belts around their hips, in which there were
thrust the jewelled hilts of swords. At the head of the table sat
one, erect and tall, evidently in death as in life the chief of
that goodly company.</p>

<p>'We were kneeling side by side gazing intently through the
glass bull's-eyes when Descrants gave a harsh, jarring laugh that
sounded frightful in that spot. I looked at him, and he at me,
and his eyes had a wild light in them. He moved backward towards
the manhole, but I stopped him, demanding to know what he meant
to do.</p>

<p>'Why, go and join them. Don't you see they've been waiting for
us ever so long,' he shouted. 'Come, help me force the manhole
up, it's not civil to keep them waiting any longer.'</p>

<p>'Then I knew what had happened; the long continued strain of
the invention, the weeks of wandering down in the sea without
life or movement or sound, had done their work on Descrants's
high-strung nerves, and this unexpected sight of horror had upset
his reason. I was alone in this cylinder at the bottom of the sea
with an irresponsible madman.'</p>

<p><br>
'ORDINARILY I save pretty stout nerves, and I retained my
presence of mind, outwardly at any rate. How I really felt, I
leave you to guess.</p>

<p>'"Listen, Descrants," I said, trying to reason, with him, "Let
us go up above first, and see the sunlight; I don't feel equal to
joining that dinner party just now."</p>

<p>'"Why not? I've felt miserable enough these last few days: but
now I am well again, help me to force the man-hole up, and we'll
go to them. Don't be frightened of them, man, we'll be like them
soon."</p>

<p>'There was no doubt we should if I didn't act quickly. I
weighed the chances of a struggle with, him; but that was
doubtful&mdash;he was as strong as I was, and had the strength of
insanity to boot. Muttering to himself and chuckling in a
blood-freezing manner, he went to the man-hole. Then I saw my
opportunity. He could never move the cover at the depth we were
then, even if we both had had the strength of ten men we could
not do it. I turned off the electric light, add started the
pump&mdash;the pump that raised us to the surface. Black darkness
shut down on that grim party in the cabin for ever, on the madman
and myself.</p>

<p>'Darkness that seemed like something real and tangible. It
startled him for the moment, and that moment saved us. I felt
that we struck something, probably one of the masts, so I knew we
were rising. Then Descrants was on to me like a mad dog. I had
hoped that the sudden shock of the darkness might have restored
his reason, but it made him worse, I think. There we fought like
two worrying wolves, in that awful blackness, to the
accompaniment of the noise of the piston rode. That noise kept me
up, if I could husband my strength and keep form from damaging
the machinery until we reached the surface I might manage him. It
seemed ages, centuries, before we came to the top, and there in
that confined space we rolled over and over, and choked each
other, and fought such a fight as never was fought before.
Suddenly, I could see a little, then plainer, plainer, and we
shot out into open day, with the sun blazing through the bull's
eyes.</p>

<p>'I gave a shout of joy, breathless as I was, and with at
mingled the whistling scream of the air rushing in through the
waste pipe to fill the exhausted tank. Such strength did the
sunlight give me that I twisted Descrants on his back, and got my
knee on his chest, with one hand on his throat. There was no help
for it, I saw, by the look in his wild beast's eyes; I must stun
him. A small spanner we carried with us was within my reach.
Before he could throw me off I seized it, and struck him a blow
on the head. He fell back senseless, and it was with a sigh of
relief I got up and opened the man-hole, and put my head outside
to recover myself. It was calm, and in the distance I could see
the white line of the breakers of the Barrier, otherwise there
was nothing in sight. I turned my attention to Descrants. He had
a pretty good scalp wound, and I let it bleed, thinking it might
do him good. Then I fastened his hands and feet, and put him in
as comfortable a position as I could, and tried to recover him. I
succeeded after a while, and when he had struggled a bit, and
found it useless, he became quiet, and I dressed his herd and
gave him a big drink of wine and water. I had decided in my own
mind that the only thing to do was to make straight for Tiau
Island, and try and nurse Descrants there.</p>

<p>'I had our position pretty well, so, shutting the manhole, I
went down five or six fathoms, and steered straight for Tiau.
That was a nasty trip for a man who had already had his nerves
pretty well tried, but fortunately it did not last long.
Sometimes Descrants raved, sometimes he was sullen, and sometimes
apparently sensible, and begged me to release him. But I said,
"No, my boy, next time you might came out top dog instead of me;"
so I kept him tied up, and fed and nursed him, and looked after
him like a mother, until we ran on the beach at Tiau Island.</p>

<p>'The natives came to meet me at a distance, but they wouldn't
come close to help me get out Descrants, but I coaxed him into a
good humor, telling him I would let him free as soon as we got
ashore, and finally undid his feet, and he got out. As soon as he
felt the land he turned quite silly, and commenced to laugh like
anything. He was quite quiet when I let him go free, only loony,
altogether loony. I saw there was no help for it&mdash;that I
should have to finish the work myself, for I never would trust
myself with him again. I stayed some days to see how he shaped,
but he was just the same&mdash;quiet, but silly and harmless. The
niggers were not frightened of him, and I gave them some trade to
look after him until I came back; and then I started for here,
and have been working here until today.'</p>

<p>'Do you think Descrants is safe with the niggers?' asked
Campbell, when the tale was told.</p>

<p>'Safe enough if he doesn't get violent, when they might knock
his brains out to keep him quiet. But he won't do that; we'll
find him there right enough.'</p>

<p>We then proceeded to discuss our future movements. We had a.
very smart little lugger at the station, which could be brought
through the passage to where we were. With this we could take toe
stuff to Tiau Island, and use the lugger for transhipping
purposes afterwards. We agreed to make trial trips in the
lobster, and see how we liked it, and then one of us could go
back in the dinghy for the lugger, and bring it down, with a
couple of the boys. There was a bit of a bight in the reef just
behind the island that would hold her like a dock made to
order.</p>

<p>Campbell and I tossed up who should go down first, and it fell
to me. So just as the sun was sinking we sank as well, beneath
the surface. I felt a bit queer at first, but the easy, confident
manner of Vowlson reassured me, and, by the time we got to the
bottom, I was just as easy as he was. That is to say, I pretended
I was. At any rate, I had a good look around, to sea as much of
the bottom of the ocean as I could. As Vowlson had said, it was a
very quiet place&mdash;there seemed to be an utter absence of
everything but the comparatively smooth, white-looking bottom,
and a shimmering, misty-looking vapor, or, of course, what looked
like vapor, but was really the effect of the brilliant electric
light on the smooth water.</p>

<p>'Come and look at the side,' said Vowlson, and I went forward,
and looked through the bull's eyes. There she lay on even keel,
but all the side opposite to us had been torn out of her by the
monster nippers of the lobster, to give access to her hold.
Behind her the reef rose up like a wall. While watching this
strange sight I saw something on the wreck move. To see anything
move in this sea of stagnant stillness was startling in the
extreme. I directed Vowlson's attention to it, and he increased
the volume of light by altering some arrangements of reflectors.
We both watched attentively, for something was moving on the
wreck&mdash;a naked man was seemingly climbing over it from the
other side.</p>

<p>As I stared with astonishment I saw what looked like another
nude figure coming over the far bulwarks, then another and
another.</p>

<p>'What is it, Vowlson?' I asked in a fright, for the thought
struck me that these must be the ghosts of the drowned sailors,
and I didn't like it.</p>

<p>'D&mdash;d if I know,' he said, 'but we'll make it out
directly.'</p>

<p>Then as I looked I saw that these things were, not naked men,
but huge flesh-colored snakes. They went crawling and writhing
about the broken-up deck, growing bigger and bigger as more of
their bodies appeared, and then a head and face looked over the
side, and I nearly shrieked with horror! Imagine the gigantic
face of a wicked old man, hairless, with the flesh in folds and
wrinkles. Imagine a huge beak planted between two fiery, savage,
glaring eyes; and imagine that from this loathsome, naked face
sprung all the flesh-colored makes, writhing and twisting about,
and you have the shuddering terror that had stopped to look at
us</p>

<p>I glanced at Vowlson, expecting to see him jump astern, to
start the machinery to fly up to the surface, but 'he was
standing looking quietly out of the bull's-eye.</p>

<p>'What is it?' I gasped.</p>

<p>'It's a deep-sea octopus,' he replied, 'a creature whose
existence is discredited, but we can see for ourselves now that
it really exists.'</p>

<p>'But I've seen an octopus; it's black, not that awful color,
and nothing like so huge,' I protested.</p>

<p>'This fabulous creature, as they call it, lives only in the
deep sea, and never comes to the surface; that's why it is
bleached like that. It's a horrid looking thing, I admit.'</p>

<p>'Will it attack us?'</p>

<p>'I believe it's coming on with that very intention.'</p>

<p>'Won't you go up?' I asked.</p>

<p>He looked at me contemptuously, but did not deign to answer. I
turned: and watched the brute, who was now evidently advancing
towards us! The nearer it got the more horrible it was; the color
gave it a human-like aspect, that was shuddering to look at. The
repulsive-looking creases in its face and body moved, and worked
as it approached us, and I think those naked wrinkles and creases
were almost the most awful thing about it. But the eyes were
devilish, and seemed to fairly blaze in the full glow of the
light. Vowlson stood like, a rock, one hand on a lever, watching
it come on.</p>

<p>Now the advanced snakes had reached us, and commenced to climb
and twist around the body of the lobster. Of course, we could not
really hear them, but, to my heightened fancy, it seemed as
though I distinctly heard their creeping crawl round our
casing.</p>

<p>And the head, with the flaming eyes, the great parrot jaws,
and the naked wrinkling face came nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>I remember thinking that we were inside a walnut, and our
shell would be cracked and be picked up, when I saw Vowlson
smile. He touched a button, and the pistons rose and fell.</p>

<p>The face was now close, to us, the eyes glaring in the full
light of the bull's-eyes. Vowlson pulled the lever over. The
lobster's nippers seized that hideous head between its jaws; a
rush of black water darkened all around, and we could see nothing
through the bull's eyes but inky blackness, with what seemed
writhing, naked figures showing out now and again.</p>

<p>We were moving; Vowlson was backing to clear these writhing
arms. Back we went until the water grew clear again, and we could
see once more. The lobster's jaws had done their work; the awful
thing now trailed shrunken and dead, with its arms lifeless and
quiet. Vowlson released the lever, the jaws opened, and the deep
sea monster dropped on the bottom.</p>

<p>Then Vowlson broke loose.</p>

<p>'Isn't she a little beauty!' he cried, insanely patting the
side of the machine. 'Isn't she a dainty darling? Bring on
another octopus; bring on your sea serpent, she'll tackle
it!'</p>

<p>I really thought he was going mad like Descrants; but I was
relieved to hear him say, 'Bring out that wine, old fellow; it's
the only thing fit to drink her health in,' for I sadly wanted a
nip. I felt when he said that, that he was certainly not mad.</p>

<p>We drank her health with three times three, and then had a
yarn over it. When we had finished we went back to the wreck, for
the water had cleared again; and taking two boxes, ascended to
the surface with them.</p>

<p>Campbell went down next. No adventure happened that trip, and
during the next twenty-four hours we made several descents, and
got up all the treasure there was.</p>

<p>We then held a council as to our next proceeding; as to
whether it would be better to go and get the lugger down at once
and proceed to Tiau, or visit the two remaining wrecks that
Vowlson had charted-down. The big Spanish ship to the south
Vowlson would not visit again on any account. The skeleton dinner
party and the madness of his companion had evidently given even
his iron nerves a turn.</p>

<p>We decided in favor of bringing the lugger down, loading her
up, and going to Tiau at once, and seeing how Descrants was
getting on. Vowlson offered to go up with one of us, whoever went
for the lugger, as he wanted to see the inner edge of the Great
Barrier, and the third man could stay on the island and wait
there.</p>

<p>Campbell and Vowlson, therefore, went up for the lugger in the
dinghy, and I stayed on the island, with the lobster and treasure
for company. The treasure was right enough, but I never got
reconciled to the lobster, much as I respected that machine.
There was a solemn-looking air of dormant life about it that made
me always expect to find it some day sedately walking about the
island, musing on the follies of mankind. One gets these sort of
thoughts when one has to keep a lonely watch on a little patch of
sand and listen to the constant boom, boom of the surf.</p>

<p>I was heartily glad when I saw the lugger's sails in the
distance. The two boys that Campbell had brought down ran below
and hid when they first saw the lobster, and it was some time
before we could reconcile them to coming close to it. However, we
set to work, and soon had the bullion loaded, and then prepared
to start for Tiau. Vowlson was going in the lobster; we were
going to take the lugger across.</p>

<p><br>
THE run across was a pleasant one, for the south-east monsoon
was blowing, and the days and nights were fine and clear. We soon
sighted Tiau, and making for a little bight that Vowlson had told
us of, dropped anchor, and went ashore. The lobster had not
arrived; but we expected to reach the island before Vowlson, so
were not alarmed for his safety.</p>

<p>The natives recognised some words that Vowlson had taught us
to repeat, and also our description of the lobster; so they
became friendly at once, and from one of them, who could speak a
little broken English, we inquired about Descrants. They managed
to convey to us that he was still silly, and lived by himself on
the other side of the island. We agreed that it was better to
await the coming of Vowlson before disturbing him, so returned to
the lugger to wait.</p>

<p>The next morning the lobster arrived, after an uneventful
trip, and we went over to where the natives said we should find
Descrants. He was sitting in front of a gunyah built of boughs,
looking idly out to sea and playing with some pebbles. He was
crooning to himself in a low tone when Vowlson went up and spoke
to him, and did not evince the least surprise at thus
unexpectedly seeing his old comrade. He was a fine-looking man;
but his eyes had a queer, furtive look in them, and he would not
look up at you. He was dirty and unkempt, but the natives bad
kept him well fed, and he looked strong and healthy enough.</p>

<p>He did not seem to be at all aroused by Vowlson's appearance,
and we went away, seeing that our presence did no good. Vowlson
seemed very downcast at finding his friend so bad, and once, as
we walked back, he said: 'I'm afraid I hit him too hard with that
spanner.'</p>

<p>Between ourselves I was afraid he had; but I didn't want to
add to his troubles, so said nothing.</p>

<p>We came to the edge of the beach, and Vowlson was just saying,
'I think I'll shift the machine out of sight,' when we were
startled by a loud yell, which was echoed in a frightened chorus
from all sides by the islanders. We soon learnt the cause of it.
The maniac had followed us back; unknown to us, and now the sight
of the lobster had brought on an acute fit. He dashed past us,
hurling Vowlson to the ground as he did so, and made straight for
the machine.</p>

<p>'Shoot him! shoot him!' screamed Vowlson, picking himself up
and racing in pursuit.</p>

<p>Too late. Before we could fire or Vowlson come anywhere near
him, the madman had reached the machine, clambered in with the
greatest agility, and closed the man-hole after him. Vowlson
halted and ran back.</p>

<p>'Take to the bush!' he shouted, and we saw what he meant.
Descrants had started the lobster, and was making towards us.
Vowlson was just in time to swarm up a palm tree, but that
availed him nothing.</p>

<p>Descrants, who, whatever his madness, possessed perfect
command of the lobster, halted and wheeled the machine. The awful
jaws closed on the tree, and in an instant it was twisted and
torn down, and Vowlson flung sprawling, but unhurt, on the sand.
Campbell and I could do nothing but look on in dumb terror of
what was coming; for inside the cylinder the madman was
impregnable. But the catastrophe was averted. Vowlson gained his
feet before the fatal claws clutched him, and doubled short round
behind them, as it were. Before we guessed his purpose he had
leaped on to the joint of one of the legs, and thence climbed to
the top of the cylinder, where he was safe for a time.</p>

<p>Even with the danger overhanging us, Campbell and I could not
help laughing at what followed, for Descrants, losing sight of
his victim, turned the ungainly machine round and round till it
looked like a live creature searching for something it had lost.
Apparently it became patent to the disordered brain that was
guiding it what had became of Vowlson, for the lobster started
straight for tho sea.</p>

<p>'Pray goodness he does not sink the lugger,' said Campbell.
But this was not the motive. Descrants evidently meant to wash
Vowlson off in the sea, where he would be an easy prey. The
lobster headed for the mouth of the little bight, where there was
a surf. I had great hopes that a resolute and ready-witted fellow
like Vowlson would manage to escape somehow, and anxiously we
watched the lobster and its rider.</p>

<p>A great wave met them as they entered the sea, and when we saw
the lobster again Vowlson was gone. We saw the machine once or
twice more, amongst the broken water; then it disappeared for
ever from our gaze, and so far, that is the last I know of the
great treasure lobster.</p>

<p>Quietly and fearfully the natives came out from their hiding
places, and went with us down to the beach to see if our friend's
body was washed ashore. Suddenly a great cry went up, and, away
from one side, came a staggering dripping figure. It was
Vowlson.</p>

<p><br>
'YES, that first roller saved me. I managed to dive into it,
and he lost sight of me in the broken water, but I had a devil of
a job to get ashore; I got nearly washed out two or three times.
If he had gone into the smooth water in the bend I should nave
had no chance. But I'd just as soon be dead, for what will become
of my machine?'</p>

<p>And the strong man looked as though he would burst out
crying.</p>

<p>'You can build another,' said Campbell, soothingly.</p>

<p>'Never such a little daisy as that. I tell you, man, she had a
soul in her. Beames, you saw her stand up to that deep sea
octopus and crush it, didn't you?'</p>

<p>We got him up to the bushes, and camped there all night, and
watched for the reappearance of the lobster, but it never came.
In the morning Vowlson had regained his spirits; and we set to
work making preparations for our departure. We had the treasure
in the lugger, and we could recover that which was placed in
another part of the Barrier by Vowlson and Descrants, so we came
out of it very well.</p>

<p>What has become of the madman Descrants and the lobster? Did
he go to join the dead company feasting under the sea, or is he
still roaming about somewhere? His intellect had recovered
sufficiently for him to be able to manage the machine, but might
it not, irresponsible as he was, lead him to some terrible deed
of madness.</p>

<p>He might enter some crowded port and sink ship after ship if
he liked. Always I shall dread to hear of something like this
happening. The idea of the most perfect and powerful submarine
vessel the world ever saw, roaming the seas in charge of a raving
maniac is not a reassuring one.</p>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>9. -- KEPT SECRET</h2>

<h3><i>Australian Town and Country Journal</i>, 19, 26 Dec
1896</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THE bar was full of tobacco smoke, bad language, and
expectoration. Men were, boasting and wrangling about themselves,
their horses, and their bullocks; for it was the night after a
bush race meeting, and the denizens of that particular portion of
the Queensland back blocks had gathered from far and near. The
meeting had been a success. Strange to say, everybody was
satisfied, especially the local publican. Those who had won wore
naturally content, while those who had lost vowed that, at any
rate, they had had a run for their money. True, there was a fly
In the publican's honey-pot. The run on bottled beer had been
phenomenal, and he saw no means of replenishing his stock. A
shortness of rum or whisky might be met and overcome, but bottled
beer was beyond his chemical skill.</p>

<p>The confusion of tongues, noise, and hustle were at their
height, when a revolver shot, in another room, startled everyone
into silence.</p>

<p>"Who's that monkeying with a pistol?" said the owner of the
place, leaving the bar and going In the direction of the sound.
He entered the little, rough bedroom from which a smell of powder
and a whiff of smoke came. Meanwhile, the conversation in the bar
welled up again. The simple discharge of a pistol did not mean
much at that time, in that part of the world.</p>

<p>The room was dark. "Anyone In there?" said the landlord, after
listening for a minute. There was no response, and he struck a
match.</p>

<p>The sudden blaze of light showed him a figure extended on the
bed. One arm, holding a revolver in the hand, was thrown over the
side, and tho weapon trailed on the earthen floor. Blood was
dripping from a wound in the temple, and the eyes, wide open, but
without speculation, told a tale of sudden death. The landlord
had presence of mind. He made no sudden outcry, but going quietly
back, drew one man aside.</p>

<p>"Mr. James, you're a J.P.; I want you to come in this room.
Old Cousens has just shot himself."</p>

<p>The man addressed, a tall, sunburned fellow, hardly moved a
muscle at the sudden information.</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I scarcely looked. I came back for you."</p>

<p>They moved on as they spoke, the landlord carrying a candle
which he had lit. Together they stooped over the recumbent
form&mdash;a man over middle age, dressed in ordinary bush dress,
which might mean any station in life, grey-haired and
grey-bearded.</p>

<p>"He's dead enough," said James. "Send Joe Kennedy in, will
you?"</p>

<p>Tho landlord departed, and presently Joe Kennedy, a young man
about thirty, entered the room.</p>

<p>"Here, Joe; you were a sucking sawbones once. Old Cousens has
shot himself. Just have a look, as I shall have to report
it."</p>

<p>Without displaying any emotion, Kennedy examined the dead man.
"Shot himself, right enough. Hair singed, death instantaneous.
Nothing else, old man. I don't suppose you want a p.m."</p>

<p>Jones was looking about the room. The head of the bed was
close to a window shuttered by some deal packing boards nailed
together. He tried it, and it swung easily open on the old
leather hinges.</p>

<p>"You're pretty sure ho did it himself, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't see him do it, any more than you did, but the
shot was fired close to his head, and he's got the pistol in his
hand, and-No, he hasn't," said Kennedy, breaking off abruptly.
"Didn't you say so?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. Barker said so."</p>

<p>"I think he had the revolver in his hand. Fact, I'm most sure
of it, but I only struck a match," said Barker.</p>

<p>Kennedy stooped. "Here it is under the bed." He picked it up
and fitted it into the empty pouch on the dead man's belt. "Seems
to be his, right enough," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's his," cried Barker. "He was shooting crows with it
the other morning."</p>

<p>It had reached the bar that Cousens had shot himself, but,
though it stilled the talk somewhat, there was no eager rush of
morbid curiosity, such as would have happened in a town&mdash;no
ghoulish, loafing men and women, nor self-important young
reporters, anxious to see blood-and brains; that is, somebody
else's blood and brains. The miserable, degraded love of gazing
at humanity hurt, or dead, Is not so common in the bush as in the
town. The men strolled off to their camps on the river bank, save
three or four who stayed at the pub, and Cousens's requiem was
pronounced in the common sentiment that it was just the sort of
thing one would have expected Cousens to do, and it was a wonder
he had not done it before.</p>

<p>The dead man was known as a man of bad temper. He had been
fulfilling some droving contracts In the district, and was
therefore well known, but by no means popular. Only that day he
had made himself disagreeable on the course. He drank heavily,
and had been drinking during the two days of the meeting.</p>

<p>"You are not quite sure that he had the revolver In his hand
when you first saw him?" asked James, as the little group stood
discussing the matter.</p>

<p>"I feel pretty sure, but I wouldn't swear to it," returned
Barker, to whom the question was ad-dressed.</p>

<p>"His hand had not stiffened. The revolver may have fallen from
it and been kicked by one of us just under the bed," suggested
Kennedy.</p>

<p>This seemed probable enough, but James was not satisfied.
"What sort of a state was Cousens in when you saw him last?"</p>

<p>"Drunk as a biled owl. I helped him into the room, and he just
chucked hisself down and lay there like a log. If anyone had told
me that in an hour he'd have got up and shot hisself I'd have
said it was a blooming impossibility."</p>

<p>"Only an hour. He couldn't have slept it off enough to have
regained consciousness, do you think, Joe?"</p>

<p>"He might have done it without being conscious&mdash;fit of
delirium come on. Anyhow, he did it."'</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that,"</p>

<p>"Why, who the deuce would have done it? He wasn't liked, but
that was no reason for blowing his brains out. Don't think
anybody had a down on him enough for that."</p>

<p>"Not here, perhaps; but nobody knows anything about his past
life, and I'll bet it wasn't one to blow about. Anyhow, Barker,
see if you can keep that place clear in front of the window. I
want to have a look for tracks in the morning."</p>

<p>"I'll do what I can, but I don't think that you'll make much
of it."</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done but straighten out the remains of
the unfortunate suicide, whom nobody regretted, over whose sudden
decease not one word of sorrow was spoken, not one tear shed.</p>

<p>"Think, you could get that bullet out, Joe?" remarked James,
as they stood looking at the corpse, now composed; and
decent.</p>

<p>"What fad have you got in your head? I'll try. Perhaps I
can."</p>

<p>It was a gruesome sight. The mean, rough room, the motionless
body on the bed, and the two men, one holding the flickering,
guttering candle, the other at his surgeon's task with rude,
impromptu tools.</p>

<p>Kennedy heaved a sigh of relief. "Look here," he said. In his
blood-dyed hand rested a small round object, like a larger clot
of blood. "It was only just inside the skull&mdash;just
penetrated the brain," he added.</p>

<p>He dipped his hands in a bucket of water and washed them and
the bullet&mdash;a small, conical one.</p>

<p>"By Jove, you're right," he continued. "There's something
crooked. This never came from Cousens's pistol. It's one of those
damned cheap affairs. A ball from this," and he picked up the
deceased's Colt, "would have gone clean through his head at close
quarters."</p>

<p>"True; and it's much too small for his weapon. This must be
reported at once. Barker, you must send to the native police
barracks."</p>

<p>"Have no one to send. Besides, they're out on patrol, else you
may be sure Fortescue would have been down here to the
races&mdash;only that blooming idjit of a camp-sergeant's
there."</p>

<p>"Well, he'll have to come, idiot as he is. I'll send a note.
One of the chaps will go in the morning, if you ask them."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. James," returned Barker, yawning, and he
strolled off to his virtuous couch.</p>

<p>James owned the run that Barker's pub was situated on, and it
behoved the latter to be civil.</p>

<p>By this time daylight was nigh, and Kennedy and James waited
up until it broke, and when the light was sufficient, set to work
examining the ground underneath the window. Then, getting some
hurdles from an old sheep-yard handy, they, enclosed the
space.</p>

<p>The weather did not allow of much lying in state, and before
noon all that was earthly of Cousens was laid under the heated
ground prayerless, for the strictest search throughout the hush
pub failed to produce anything in the shape of a prayer book,
with the exception of some loose pages of the Commination
Service, which James thought might lead to criticism if read. So
Cousens was put underground without any form of words being read
over him, and presumably slumbered just as soundly. James took
down the depositions of the different witnesses, and handed them
to the camp-sergeant to deliver to his officer on his return. But
the proper authorities, whoever they were, evinced no desire to
trouble about it. After a passing shower had obliterated the
tracks James and Kennedy had sought to preserve, a raw new-chum
of a policeman, fresh from the sod, turned up to make inquiries;
which inquiries, mostly conducted in Barker's bar, led him to
assert that it was as simple a case of suicide as ever was, at
all. So he departed.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
THE summer had passed, and the bright, sunny winter weather of
the tropical interior had set in. Kennedy had ridden over to
James's place on some business errand and found that individual
pondering over a letter just received. He silently handed it to
his friend to read.</p>

<p>It was long, but the gist of the matter was to inquire after
her husband, Geoffrey Cousens, who, the writer understood, had
committed suicide at the Bowgango Crossing. If so, had he left
any property behind, and who held possession of it? It was signed
Gertrude Cousens, and she informed James that she had obtained
his name from the list of Js.P.</p>

<p>Kennedy looked at the address, Melbourne.</p>

<p>"Wonder she didn't write before," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, she's had plenty of time. But one strange thing I
notice: although she professes only to have seen the account in
the newspapers, which was merely, a couple of lines, she lets
slip every now and again that she knows all about the details;
and as my name was mentioned in the paragraph, she goes, out of
her way to tell me that she looked up any name in the list of
Js.P. That lady knows more than we do."</p>

<p>"What shall you do?"</p>

<p>"Simply write that, all his possessions were handed over to
the Government, and she had better apply to the curator of
intestate estates. But she won't, you see."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because she is not his wife, and to get his money&mdash;there
were some hundreds to his credit&mdash;she will have to prove her
identity."</p>

<p>"I believe the man was murdered. But then, neither you nor I
could afford to waste our time and money, and we had no interest
in the fellow."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if this dame could tell us something we
don't know yet."</p>

<p>"Remember those tracks&mdash;" James suddenly darted by his
visitor, nearly upsetting him, and rushed out on the verandah.
There was a scuffle, and loud voices. When Kennedy got out James
was holding a young man by the collar who was protesting vainly
against it.</p>

<p>"What were you listening at the door for?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't listening; I was coming in, and looked in first just
to see if you was engaged."</p>

<p>"You young liar; I saw your head once or twice before I came
after you."</p>

<p>"What should I be listening for? I only came to see if there
were any letters."</p>

<p>"It's the mail-boy, isn't it?" asked Kennedy.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'll find out what he was sneaking about the
verandah for, or it will he the worse for him."</p>

<p>Kennedy whispered something to him. "Go inside," said.
James.</p>

<p>The young fellow obeyed sullenly.</p>

<p>"Who wrote this letter?" asked Kennedy, picking it up and
holding it up so that the lad could see the writing.</p>

<p>The boy, for he was little more, hesitated. At last he seemed
to make his mind up.</p>

<p>"My mother," he said, firmly.</p>

<p>The two exchanged glances. "You wanted to hear the contents, I
suppose. How did you know that it had come. Did you open any
bag?"</p>

<p>"No. My mother wrote to say that she was writing to you."</p>

<p>"Too thin, any friend. You could give her as much information
as I could about your father's death. He was your father, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he and my another had quarrelled, and he would not
acknowledge us."</p>

<p>"Us? Any more of you?"</p>

<p>"I have a sister."</p>

<p>"A good-looking girl&mdash;barmaid at the Criterion, in Islop.
I recognise the face now. You have run the mail between here and
Islop for the last year?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Were you at the Bowgango Crossing at the time of your
father's death?"</p>

<p>The boy hesitated. "No," he said.</p>

<p>"That's easily found out. I believe you were. Now I understand
how it as that your mother knows so much about the affair. Of
course, you told her."</p>

<p>"Yes. There was no harm in that."</p>

<p>"Certainly not. But even if your father would not recognise
you, why did you not avow yourself as his son at the time?"</p>

<p>"There were reasons."</p>

<p>Kennedy looked hard at James, and he dropped the subject.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know your father was murdered?" he said,
suddenly.</p>

<p>The mail-boy turned deathly white, and held on to the
table.</p>

<p>"No," he exclaimed, hoarsely. "I left early in the
morning."</p>

<p>"You left early in the morning! And you were not there at all,
at the time? Come, you had better make a clean breast of it. You
have betrayed yourself."</p>

<p>The young fellow sat down and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"I was afraid so," he sobbed,</p>

<p>"Now," said Kennedy, "if you tell us the whole truth, we will
help you if we can. You were at the Crossing when your father
died?"</p>

<p>"No, I was not; I told you tho truth. My sister rode the mail
that trip. She wanted to see my father, to beg him to behave
right to us."</p>

<p>"To behave right to your mother, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They were not married. If he had married her quietly and
acknowledged us, as though he had been married all along, it
would never have been known that we were illegitimate."</p>

<p>"And your sister saw him, and he refused?"</p>

<p>"So she told me. I know nothing more."</p>

<p>"I will go to Islop and see your sister," said Kennedy.</p>

<p>The boy started up. "You will see her alone, Mr. Kennedy? You
won't do anything else, will you, sir? I have been so frightened
ever since she persuaded me to let her go. She is so proud, and
ashamed of the truth about us being known."</p>

<p>"I have always heard a very good character of her. I will ride
back with you to-morrow."</p>

<p>The boy left, after a wistful glance at them both, as if
beseeching their pity.</p>

<p>"So this accounts for all," said James. "That strange track
was the girl without her boots, and she changed the revolvers
when Barker was away. Well, it is a domestic tragedy that I
shan't interfere with. Seems to me Cousens got all he
deserved."</p>

<p>"Yes. Fancy that chuckle-headed fool of a policeman being sent
here on such an errand. I think you'd better let me go alone, and
compound this crime, as you're a J.P."</p>

<p>"Damn the J.P.! But you go and do as you like. I will agree
with anything you promise."</p>

<p><br>
THE girl told Kennedy her story, defiantly enough.</p>

<p>"I saw him atone," she said. "He cursed me, called me vile
names. My mother, who, whatever her faults, has been true to him,
he called the worst he could put his tongue to&mdash;said he
didn't believe he was my father, and would hound us both out of
the district: would tell all the men at the races that I was a
girl riding about the country in my brother's clothes, and then
drove me away from him.</p>

<p>"I went to the window of his room to try him once more, looked
in, and heard him snoring in his drunken sleep. I don't know what
came into my head, but I thought if he were dead we could say
what we liked. I drew out the little revolver my brother always
carried, and putting it to his head, fired. He threw out his arm.
I put tho revolver in his hand and dropped the arm; then I closed
the shutter, and as I did so remembered the mistake I had made.
Someone came into the room and struck a match. They went out
again. I opened the window, leaned in, took the revolver out of
his hand, dropped it on the floor, and got away with my
brother's, just before you came in.</p>

<p>"I did not hear that anything but suicide was suspected."</p>

<p>"No; James and I only got snubbed about it, so we held our
tongues. But you were in your stockings when you went out the
window, were you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I took my boots off."</p>

<p>"We couldn't 'make head nor tail of the track. Why did you get
your mother to write to James? He could do nothing."</p>

<p>"I didn't know anything about the law regarding dead men's
property, and thought that he would tell her."</p>

<p>"She could not prove her marriage, as she would he required to
do; so she could not claim any-thing. Well, and what next?"</p>

<p>"That rests with you. I shall not run away."</p>

<p>"That's just what you'll have to do, and the sooner the
better. James and I will give your brother something to help you
off, and we shall say nothing. I don't consider your father any
great loss to society, and what you did was done in a moment of
passion. Good-bye."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
SOME five years after, Kennedy went to England on the death of
his father.</p>

<p>"Who do you think came out in the same steamer as I did?" he
asked his friend James one evening after his return.</p>

<p>"Anybody! How can I guess?"</p>

<p>"The heroine of the Cousens affair. She married a rich man in
Melbourne, and had been home on her wedding trip."</p>

<p>"I suppose you didn't discuss 'the past?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, we were strangers right through the trip, or
as nearly so as fellow-passengers can be. It was the best way out
of the situation."</p>

<p>"Decidedly so," returned James.</p>

<h3>THE ELDER BACKFORD'S STORY</h3>

<h3><i><b>February 5.</b></i></h3>

<p class="first">
THOSE who persist in saying that I, in any way consented to
the experiment, either lie deliberately, or are entirely ignorant
of the circumstances. Bletchford could bear me out in this if he
chose! but he is only anxious to evade all responsibility,
although he was the prime mover in the matter.</p>

<p>My younger brother Francis had always been weak and delicate,
and possessed a highly imaginative disposition. This did not
assist him to regain health and strength; his mind was too
vigorous for his body, and was gradually wearing it out. Many
times, when we were boys, have I had to follow him through the
house to see that he did not come to harm during his
somnambulistic rambles.</p>

<p>Gradually he grew out of this habit; but became a confirmed
visionary, always attracted by any new speculations on the occult
and the unknown. Fortunately he had too keen a brain to permit of
his becoming a prey of the vulgar impostors calling themselves
mediums; but where the theory appeared rational and logical he
pursued it with avidity.</p>

<p>The separation of the soul from the body during life had a
peculiar fascination for him; and he used to fast and
experimentalise on himself to see if he could attain the desired
object of leaving his body at will. In vain I remonstrated with
him, and pointed out how he was undermining his health when he
had none too much to spare. He only laughed at me, and told me
that because I was robust and found my pleasure in outdoor
sports, I was not capable of appreciating such deep and abstruse
questions as occupied his time.</p>

<p>It was just then that Bletchford came on a visit to us. At
this period I was 36 and my brother 30. Our parents were dead; we
had each a small private fortune, and lived together for the sake
of company. Bletchford was an old friend, and I hoped that his
coming would rouse my brother, and lead to his interesting
himself in less morbid pursuits.</p>

<p>In this, to my great disgust, I was greatly disappointed.
Bletchford had caught the craze and was deeper in the study of
occultism than my brother. Instead of weaning him from his
studies he encouraged him to continue in them, and, disgusted and
sick at heart, left them to themselves, and sought my own
diversions.</p>

<p>About three weeks after Bletchford had been with us he came to
me, and, taking my arm confidentially, said:</p>

<p>'We have completely succeeded, at least in the case of your
brother. I am too gross, apparently, to enter into the higher
circle.'</p>

<p>'Higher humbug,' I replied, rudely. 'What does all this
tommyrot mean?'</p>

<p>'It means that your brother can enter at will into the spirit
world, leaving his body apparently lifeless.'</p>

<p>I forget what I said, but it was something very personal and
offensive, but Bletchford took it quietly.</p>

<p>'As yet,' he said, 'your brother has made no sustained effort,
and instead of there being any injury to his health, he looks
better and stronger. To-night we are going to prolong the
experiment. Will you be present?'</p>

<p>I told him hotly that I would not countenance any such sinful
folly. Then I went to my brother and sought earnestly to dissuade
him from dabbling with things better left alone.</p>

<p>He only smiled good-naturedly, and told me he was surely old
enough to judge for himself. I departed in anger, and left them
to continue their experiment by themselves. I declare that I did
my best to stop it, and failed. I saw neither of them again that
night, but at breakfast next morning Bletchford turned up looking
very white and, haggard.</p>

<p>'Where's Francis?' I asked.</p>

<p>'He's lying down,' he said. He spoke very little, and I
concluded that their precious experiment had failed, and that
they both felt ashamed of themselves. Breakfast finished I rose,
intending to go see my brother, when Bletchford stopped me at the
door.</p>

<p>'Are you going up to Francis?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, I am,' I answered. 'Don't be alarmed, but he's still
unconscious; but it will be all right directly. The experiment
was only to last three hours, but his soul has not returned
yet.'</p>

<p>I shook his hand off, and hastened upstairs without a word. My
brother lay on his bed fully dressed, his countenance was calm
and placid, but there seemed no sign of life about him. Hastily
brushing past Bletchford with a very strong oath, I called our
man servant and told him to go directly for a doctor. Bletchford
tried to speak to me while we awaited the doctor's arrival, but I
refused to answer him.</p>

<p>The doctor came and made an exhaustive examination of my poor
brother's body.</p>

<p>'He is not dead,' he said, when he had concluded. 'It is more
like a cataleptic trance than anything else. The pulse is
extremely weak, but steady. He must be watched continually, and
at the first indication of returning life the vitality must be
carefully nursed with restoratives.'</p>

<p>After a few more instructions the doctor departed, and I got
everything ready against the return of life, Bletchford wandered
about with a hangdog look on his face, but I felt no pity for
him. All at once there was a movement in the inanimate body. A
deep sigh escaped the lips, and I hastened to follow out the
doctor's injunctions to the letter. With joy I noticed that I was
successful. The life seemed to grow while I watched. In a short
time he sat up, and looked wonderingly around, then at us in a
dazed sort of way.</p>

<p>'Where am I? What's the meaning of this?' Francis said.
Bletchford and I looked at each other, dumb with astonishment.</p>

<p>My brother, although so delicate, had a strong, manly voice.
The voice that asked the above questions was the soft and rather
pleasing voice of a young girl. Then I looked in the eyes, and
they were not the eyes of Francis.</p>

<p>'Now, is this some trick?' went on the voice. 'Why am I here
dressed in man's clothes? It's a very poor joke, and not one
gentlemen would indulge in.'</p>

<p>'O, great heavens!' said Bletchford, sinking on a chair, with
a look of despair on his' face. 'There's been a mix up somehow,
and the wrong soul has come back. A girl's soul, too!' and he
covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p>'Gracious! What's the matter with him?' said, the new Francis.
'What does he mean about the wrong soul coming back? Let me think
a bit.'</p>

<p>We all remained silent. The situation was too tremendous.</p>

<p>'I remember flying headlong out of the buggy,' went on the
girlish voice, after a while. 'Then sparks, and nothing more.
What's today?'</p>

<p>'Thursday,' I answered, finding my voice at last.</p>

<p>'That was on Tuesday. Where am I?'</p>

<p>'In one of the suburbs of Sydney,' said Bletchford, speaking
up like a man for the first time.</p>

<p>'From what you say you were thrown from a buggy and rendered
senseless?'</p>

<p>'Yes; Jessie Carter bet me a new hat that I couldn't drive the
buckboard over a three-foot log.'</p>

<p>'Where did this happen?'</p>

<p>'Why, where we live, at Jamestown, in South Australia.'</p>

<p>'Let me explain,' went on Bletchford. 'While you have been
unconscious, your soul, absent from your body, has entered the
body of Francis Backford, then lying in a trance. His soul,
therefore, cannot get back to its rightful body, but I think I
can put matters straight. If you will permit me to put you into a
mesmeric sleep, the soul of Francis Backford will regain its
shell, and you will be able to do the same.'</p>

<p>'Who am I, after all?'</p>

<p>'At present you are my brother, Francis Backford,' I answered.
'You have eight hundred a year of your own, and, as my brother
was not an extravagant man, I expect there is a balance in the
bank. Now, I think you will see the reason of submitting to Mr.
Bletchford's mesmeric powers, and get rid of a body which must be
only an encumbrance to you, and make way for the rightful owner,
whom you are keeping out in the cold.'</p>

<p>Our strange visitor pondered, and presently raised
her&mdash;no, I mean his&mdash;head, and I saw a wicked gleam in
his eyes.</p>

<p>'Now I'm here, I think I'll stop here. I've often wished to be
a man&mdash;they have much better time than women. Now I have a
chance to try what it is like.'</p>

<p>'But,' stammered Bletchford, 'that would be unfair,
preposterous, unwomanly&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I'm not a woman,' interrupted Francis, 'and I intend to
stop.'</p>

<p>'But,' I said, 'your people will bury your real body.'</p>

<p>'Let them; I've got this one. Now, a last word. I'm your
brother, and you can't deny it, and this is my home. Is this my
room?'</p>

<p>'It is,' I sighed.</p>

<p>'Then I'll trouble you to go out. I want to overhaul my new
wardrobe, and get the hang of these masculine garments.'</p>

<p>We left, and I was too downcast even to reproach
Bletchford.</p>

<h3><i>March 5.</i></h3>

<p class="first">IT is just a month since the new Francis
arrived, and my hair is rapidly turning grey. Bletchford has
deserted me, and she&mdash;no, he&mdash;has been going on in a
way to blast my brother's character for ever. Whether it is owing
to the new vitality infused in the body of my poor lost brother
or not, I cannot say; but it has developed an appearance of
health and strength really wonderful. Every girl in the
neighborhood is in love with him, and I have received countless
letters warning me that he would get his bones broken if I didn't
stop him from interfering with other men's girls; but he only
laughs. His innate knowledge of the sex, I suppose, renders him
perfectly, irresistible. Didn't Olivia fall hopelessly in love
with Viola?</p>

<h3><i>March 9.</i></h3>

<p class="first">HE informed me to-night that he had joined a
'push.' Says he never imagined that men had such jolly times of
it; wouldn't be a girl again for anything. I'll advertise for
Bletchford; he left no address. At least he must see me through,
for I cannot stand it alone much longer.</p>

<h3><i>March 15.</i></h3>

<p class="first">THREE communications from different lawyers,
stating that unless compensation is forthcoming, writs for
actions of breach of promise will be at once issued. Only three,
I expected a dozen.</p>

<h3><i>March 16.</i></h3>

<p class="first">HAD to bail him out of the lockup last night.
Thank heaven Bletchford has written to say that he will be here
to-morrow.</p>

<h3>BLETCHFORD'S STORY</h3>

<p class="first">BACKFORD has told the tale of our unhappy
experiment, and has asked me to write the sequel. But, first, I
want to state that I have solemnly renounced all accursed
dabblings with things that are wisely hidden from us; and I
earnestly entreat all others to do the same lest they go through
the tribulation we have gone through.</p>

<p>Old Backford welcomed me with effusion. Poor fellow, he looks
ten years older. The new Francis didn't seem to like my coming at
all. I see a gleam of hope. This racketing about has upset his
nervous system, and if I get the chance I'll soon have him under
control.</p>

<p>Francis has come back. Yesterday a tall, gaunt, powerful man,
with a broken nose, came to the door, and inquired for Backford.
Soon afterwards I heard my name loudly called, and going
downstairs found the two standing hand in hand.</p>

<p>'This is Francis&mdash;my Francis!' said Backford, with tears
in his eyes.</p>

<p>'I held out my hand in doubt and astonishment.</p>

<p>'Yes, Bletchford,' said the man in a deep, hoarse voice, with
a villainous accent which I won't reproduce; 'I got tired of
hanging round waiting for that vixen to let me have my property
back, so I collared the first body that came to hand. I'm Boko
Ben, a pugilist, at present. Knocked out senseless in a glove
fight at Melbourne the other night.'</p>

<p>We both were delighted, and at once proceeded to discuss our
plans.</p>

<p>'Supposing I pick a quarrel with him, and knock him
senseless?' said the real Francis, bringing his leg of mutton
fist down on the table.</p>

<p>'Never do; he wouldn't fight,' said his brother. 'He'll only
scratch and pull your hair.'</p>

<p>'Well, we must wait and watch for an opportunity,' said the
real Francis, alias Boko Ben.</p>

<p>The new Francis did not seem to enjoy the advent of Ben at
all; somehow he seemed instinctively frightened of Him. So things
went on for nearly a week, Francis still continuing to pursue his
wild career; whilst poor Ben groaned to witness the way in which
his body and reputation were being treated.</p>

<p>I never have seen Miss Sophy Humber in her own proper person.
She might possibly be well-behaved and fascinating; but while
she was masquerading in her stolen body, there never was such an
incarnate spirit of evil, nor one more cordially hated by the
three of us. We'd have poisoned her willingly; but that would
only have spoiled everything. During my absence I had learned her
name from the papers, the incident of her lying at her parents'
residence in a cataleptic state having naturally aroused much
interest.</p>

<p>We were at dinner one evening, the three of us, when the door
opened, and in staggered the new Francis&mdash;drunk. This was
his first outbreak in the drink line, and my heart gave a bound
as I thought that at last my enemy was delivered into my hand. He
held on by the back of a chair and laughed foolishly.</p>

<p>'Givesh glassh wine,' he said. I arose, approached him, and
got his eyes under my control. He seemed to get uneasy, and
muttered something about 'an old ape,' and 'knocking my blooming
head off,' but I saw with joy that the fumes of drink were
passing away, and I had him in my power.</p>

<p>I made some quick downward passes, throwing all my energy into
them, and at my command he relinquished his hold of the chair and
walked steadily over to the sofa, and laid himself down.</p>

<p>'Quick,' I said to Ben. 'Put all your will into it, and be
ready to slip into your body directly there's a chance.'</p>

<p>I very soon had him under my influence, and Boko Ben, an
apparently lifeless shell, lay inert in an armchair. I went over
to the other, and throwing all the psychic force I possessed into
my work, willed the soul of Sophy Humber out of the body of
Francis Backford.</p>

<p>The eyes were open, and gradually light and life went out of
them, and I knew that she was gone. There was an oppressive
silence while Backford and I watched with intense anxiety. Then
life kindled again in the eyes, the breath returned, and as
Francis sat up his proper self I dropped fainting and exhausted
on a chair.</p>

<p>When I was restored to my senses the brothers were standing by
me and Boko Ben was sitting up in the armchair.</p>

<p>'I say,' he said, 'that was a mean trick to take advantage of
a man when he was screwed.' We all three burst out laughing.</p>

<p>The girl's voice coming from the frame of the broken-nosed
bruiser was too funny; the soul of Sophy had taken refuge in
Ben's body.</p>

<p>I was about to offer to mesmerise her again, and give her a
chance to go back to her own body, which was getting tired of
waiting; but Backford whispered to me, 'I think four and twenty
hours in Ben's body would do her good.'</p>

<p>I nodded assent, and Backford turning to the sham pugilist,
said, 'Here, be off as quick as you can; you've got money, in
your pocket, and can get a lodging elsewhere.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean? I'm not going to be turned out.'</p>

<p>'Yes, you are, if you don't go quietly; you've no business
here.'</p>

<p>'But I won't go. I'm big enough to smash the three of you, and
I'll do it.'</p>

<p>'No, you won't. You have the size, but only the spirit of a
girl inside it. Now go!'</p>

<p>'Send me to sleep, and let me get back to my own body,' said
Ben, turning to me.</p>

<p>'Not to-night; I'm too tired out,' I replied. Ben rose, he saw
there was no help.</p>

<p>'Have a look at yourself in the glass before you go,'
suggested Backford. Ben approached the mantelpiece, and looked.
He gave one heart-broken wail and went out. The disfigured face
and broken nose were too much for the soul of Sophy Humber. For
the first time I felt pity!</p>

<p>Next morning about 12 o'clock Ben appeared again, a
dilapidated ruin. From what we could learn he had sought to drown
his sorrows in drink, obtained in threepenny pubs, had passed
the night in the police cell, and had only been just released.</p>

<p>I was about to take pity on him, when Backford stopped me
again. 'Supposing Ben's spirit does not come back for his body,'
he said, 'we don't want the apparent corpse of a pugilist in the
house.'</p>

<p>I took the hint, and made an appointment with Ben to meet me
elsewhere. To make a long story short, I released the soul of
Sophy, and as I saw about her wonderful recovery in the paper, I
infer that she got back to her body safely. What became of Ben's
husk I know not, but as I've heard nothing of a startling
discovery, I presume the rightful owner appropriated it
again.</p>

<p>The Backfords had to sell their house, and go to Victoria.
Sophy had made it altogether too hot for them. The actions were
squared, and altogether it was a most costly experiment.</p>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>11. -- THE BURNING MOUNTAIN OF THE INTERIOR</h2>

<h3><i>Queenslander</i>, Brisbane, 15, 22 an 29 March 1890</h3>

<p class="first">
<i>[Ludwig Leichardt, the German-born explorer successfully
explored overland from the Dalby area of Queensland to Port
Essington north of Darwin in 1844-46. In 1848 he set out again,
this time intending to cross the continent to the Swan River on
the west coast. The party was last seen on 3 April 1848 at a
cattle station west of Roma, Queensland, and then vanished
without trace. The mystery greatly impressed later explorers
including Favenc, who had his own theories. This fantasy story
includes an encounter with the last living member of the
expedition, among other unlikely things. &mdash;TW]</i></p>

<h3>CHAPTER 1</h3>

<p class="chaphead">The Start for the Burning Mountain&mdash;Sand and Scrub</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
IT is the beginning of November. The sun has gone down at the
close of a day of blistering heat, and the short twilight is
rapidly fading into the darkness of a moonless night. Under the
veranda of a rough mud hut, far up in the north of South
Australia, in fact almost on the boundary line that separates
that colony from its dependency, the Northern Territory, three
men are sitting, indolently smoking the evening pipe that usually
follows the last meal of the day.</p>

<p>The hut is the principal building on a northern cattle
station, and the three occupants of the veranda are the owner
thereof, a young relation (who is gaining that much talked of
article, colonial experience), and a friend from a neighbouring
station.</p>

<p>"Well," says Morton, the owner, a sun-tanned wiry little
fellow, addressing his neighbour, "what do you say, Brown, to
having a look for the burning mountain?"</p>

<p>"Um!" grunts Brown, who differs considerably in size, owning
as he does some 6ft. 3in. of humanity; "isn't this weather hot
enough for you without looking for burning mountains?"</p>

<p>"We've nothing much to do for two or three months, and I've
long made up my mind to see if there's any truth in the yarn the
niggers have."</p>

<p>"I never could make anything out of it," remarked Brown.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Morton; "but everybody puts it down that they
mean a burning mountain. Now, I've tried very patiently and can
only get from them that there's a big fire burning always in the
same place, but when I ask about a mountain they say no. None of
them have ever been there, and they seem frightened to talk about
it."</p>

<p>"They have much the same word for rocks, stones, and
mountains."</p>

<p>"Yes, and it is rocks I think they mean."</p>

<p>"What has your boy, Billy Button, to say about it?"</p>

<p>"Billy comes from a tribe nearly a hundred miles from here; he
has heard about it, but has never seen any blacks who have been
there."</p>

<p>"North of west it is supposed to lie; how far have you been
out there, Morton?"</p>

<p>"Some fifty miles, all scrub and sand, but the niggers get
across in some seasons, and I think this is the right time, as
there have been plenty of thunderstorms in that direction."</p>

<p>"Well I'll go. A little scorching more or less does not matter
much up here. You ought to have kept some camels when the teams
were up here."</p>

<p>"Didn't think of it, but I fancy horses will be handier; we
have a thunderstorm nearly every day."</p>

<p>"And shall have till we start," replied Brown; "then you see
they will knock off. How many of us will there be?"</p>

<p>"The pair of us, and&mdash;what do you say, Charley? Are you
anxious to distinguish yourself?"</p>

<p>"I hope you won't leave me behind," replied Charley in rather
a hurt tone.</p>

<p>"All right; Billy Button will make four, and that will be
enough. To-morrow we'll have all the horses in and get everything
ready for a start the next day."</p>

<p>"How long shall we be away?" asked Charley, who bore upon his
shoulders the onerous duties of storekeeper.</p>

<p>"Can't say! What do yon think, Brown? About six weeks?"</p>

<p>"We surely ought to find something in that time, if it's only
the remains of Leichhardt."</p>

<p>"Make up two months' rations, Charley; I hate to go short;
lucky we killed the other day, the beef will be just right."</p>

<p>On an outside cattle station where so much camping out has to
be done the preparations for such a trip do not take long, and
the morning of the second day found everything ready.</p>

<p>Brown had sent over to his place for horses, and in all they
started with fourteen, two apiece for riding, four packed with
rations, and two with water and the necessary blankets, tent, and
fly. At the last moment the blacks about the station tried to
dissuade Billy from going by horrible stories of the fate
awaiting them all, but Billy scorned to remain.</p>

<p>The first thirty miles of the first day's journey in search of
the burning mountain, the discovery of which was to immortalise
the finders, was over country well known to them; beyond
stretched a waste of sand hills and mulga scrub, into which
Morton had once penetrated some twenty miles. With full water
bags and a firm determination not to be beaten back without a
struggle, our adventurers commenced the second day's journey. The
sombre scrub and heavy sand without a sign of break or change in
the depressing monotony was their experience the whole of the
day; scarcely the note of a bird or insect broke the silence as
they toiled on without much heart for conversation.</p>

<p>Towards evening a piece of good fortune befell them; on a
small flat between the sand ridges they crossed a patch of short
green grass, the result of a thunderstorm that had fallen some
time before. No water, though, could be found; the hot summer sun
had evaporated all that had been caught by the shallow clay
pans.</p>

<p>The horses, however, stopped well on the soft young feed, and
by daybreak the next morning they were once more on the move.
About 10 o'clock they ascended a sand ridge a good deal higher
than those formerly crossed, and from the crest they were able to
look around on the sea of scrub that encircled them. Not far off
in the direction they were going Morton drew the attention of his
companions to a thin column of black smoke.</p>

<p>"Burning mountain already?" queried Brown.</p>

<p>"Niggers hunting; the scrub looks thinner there," said Morton.
"They won't be far from camp at this time, but I expect it's only
a soak-hole, not enough for us."</p>

<p>In less than an hour they were riding over patches of still
burning grass thinly scattered over a bloodwood flat; but the
sharp eyes neither of Morton nor Billy could detect a sign of the
hunters. After searching for some time the boy found the tracks
of a blackfellow, two gins, and some pickaninnies coming from the
westward, and these they followed back for about a mile to a
freshly abandoned camp. It was situated on a tolerably open piece
of country, partly covered with coarse drift sand; not far from
the camp was a ragged old gum-tree, much tomahawk-marked.</p>

<p>Billy, who had gone to this tree at once, gave a low whistle
and the others came up. He pointed to a remarkably small hole
close to the butt, and, dismounting, put his arm down and then
peered into it.</p>

<p>"Water long way flown," he said; "gone bung, I think;" by
which they understood that the supply had dried up.</p>

<p>After some search a long sapling was procured and thrust down.
The hole was about ten feet deep, and the end of the sapling
brought up some wet mud.</p>

<p>"How did they get down, Billy?" said Brown.</p>

<p>"Pickaninny go down," replied the boy, pointing to a tiny
foothold in the bank.</p>

<p>"Well, boys," said Morton, who had been poking the sapling
down vigorously and examining the point, "I don't see much to be
got out of this; evidently there's been just one family here, and
they've been dried out; it would take us two hours to open up the
hole, and then we'd get little for our pains."</p>

<p>"Water gone bung," repeated Billy.</p>

<p>"What do you say to following this flat? It's going partly our
direction; it may lead to something."</p>

<p>No one having anything better to suggest, they resumed their
journey once more until a mid-day halt was made.</p>

<p>"Well, respected leader," remarked Brown after the meal was
finished and pipes were lit, "I'm afraid our horses will look
mighty dicky to-morrow morning unless we get them a drink
to-night."</p>

<p>Morton glanced lazily at them where they stood grouped under
whatever scanty shade they could obtain.</p>

<p>"Beginning to look tucked up," he returned, "but we'll pull up
something before dark."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Brown as he stood up; "go ahead, Captain
Cook."</p>

<p>About 4 o'clock the open flat which they had followed grew
narrower until at last the scrub closed in entirely and they
found themselves confronted by a thicker growth than any they had
yet met with, the mulga having given place to a species of
mallee. Morton who was leading stopped.</p>

<p>"We had better push through it," he said; "it may be only a
belt, and if we start to follow it round we shall be all night in
it."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Brown.</p>

<p>"I'll take a turn ahead if you like. I prefer being first in a
scrub." Morton laughed and dropped behind, and for about an hour,
the scrub getting worse and worse, very slow progress was made.
The sun was getting low, and the cheerful prospect of a night in
the scrub was before them, when to the relief of all Brown
suddenly called out, "Hurrah! we're out of it!"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 2</h3>

<p class="chaphead">A Native Cemetery&mdash;Billy's
Explanation&mdash;<br>
Stopped By Scrub&mdash;Discovery of a Strange Road.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">AS the party one by one emerged from the scrub
their eyes were delighted by a prospect of open downs country
dotted here and there with clumps of gidea scrub; but, better
than all, not a mile away was plainly to be seen a line of creek
timber, whilst the presence of water was shown by the flights of
white corellas hovering about. It was not long before the party
were comfortably encamped beside a good-sized waterhole and the
horses luxuriating in a full supply. Brown with his pipe as usual
under full blast was enjoying the scene, when Billy, who had been
wandering about the camp, came up and remarked, "No sleep
here."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Brown.</p>

<p>Billy pointed to a thick patch of scrub a short distance off,
and beckoned to him to follow. Brown noticed that the tops of the
trees looked remarkably thick and dense, but it was not until he
was close that he saw the reason. Nearly every tree of any size
bore a rude scaffolding, and on the top of every scaffolding was
either a bleached skeleton or a dried mummy-like corpse. The
ground, too, was covered with bones and skulls that had fallen
down.</p>

<p>Brown called to the others, and they came and looked with awe
at this strange sepulchre.</p>

<p>"I've often seen them in the trees, one or two in one place,
but nothing like this. Why, there must be over a hundred here,"
said Morton.</p>

<p>"Strange!" remarked Brown, after a closer inspection; "all the
dried bodies have a red smudge on the forehead."</p>

<p>"No sleep here; by-and-by this fellow get up, walk about,"
insisted Billy.</p>

<p>This remark rather dispelled the slight gloom caused by the
sight of so many human bodies, and Billy had to undergo a good
deal of chaffing, but it was evident that his fright was
real.</p>

<p>No ghostly visitants, however, came to the camp that night,
but just before daylight Charley woke up, and, finding Billy fast
asleep, a wicked idea came into his head. Brown dabbled a little
in sketching, and Charley soon found the colour-box in one of the
pack-bags, and proceeded to paint Billy's forehead red after the
manner of the mummies in the scrub.</p>

<p>"Halloo, Billy," said Morton as the quarts were boiling;
"what's up with your head?"</p>

<p>Billy grinned, not understanding what was meant.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Brown, taking his hand glass out of the
pack. Billy looked and turned as white as he possibly could.</p>

<p>"He come up," he said at last, pointing to the scrub, and
looking all round as though he expected to find some mummies
still walking about.</p>

<p>"Tell him you did it, Charley," said Morton. "I'm afraid
you've funked him, and if so he'll bolt."</p>

<p>Charley laughingly complied, and after Billy had been induced
to wash off the paint and had inspected the paint-box he was
somewhat comforted, but evidently still thought that the subject
was not a fit one to joke about. Struck by this, Morton after
some trouble got from him that he had heard of the men with red
foreheads who were supposed to live near the burning mountain
that they pretended to be dead during the day but got up and
walked about at night.</p>

<p>"This looks like being on the right track," said Morton to
Brown. "Um! nice sort of company you are bringing us into;
however, death or glory! Lead on, Major Mitchell!"</p>

<p>And in a short time the water-hole and the ghastly scrub
beside it were left behind. The patch of open country proved
unfortunately to be of very limited extent; in a short time they
found themselves again entangled in the dense scrub, which was
now becoming a most formidable obstacle.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the day even the sanguine Morton began
to despair of pushing on at the slow rate they were going, and to
meditate a return to their camp of the night before and a fresh
start in a new direction. At noon they were compelled to halt;
the desert hedgewood had now made its appearance, and the barrier
presented by it was almost impenetrable.</p>

<p>"What do you say, Brown?" asked Morton when their meal was
finished; "will you go north for a mile or two, and I'll do the
same south, and see if there's anything like a gap in this
confounded scrub?"</p>

<p>"My dear Captain Flinders, I am entirely at your disposal. I
think we shall get along faster on foot."</p>

<p>"I think so too. Charley, you and Billy stop here till we come
back."</p>

<p>It was a good two hours before the cracking of boughs and
muttered bad language from the south announced to Charley and
Billy the re-turn of Morton.</p>

<p>"How did you get on?" was the query.</p>

<p>"Get on!" returned Morton. "I didn't get on at all; don't
believe I got half a mile from here. It's the worst old man scrub
I was ever in; I've barked my hands nicely. If old Brown did no
better we shall have to go and cut him out with a tomahawk."</p>

<p>Almost as ho spoke Billy held up his hand, and said,</p>

<p>"Mitter Brown come up."</p>

<p>In a minute or two his tall form emerged from the thicket. "I
beg to report, sir," he said to Morton with much solemnity, "that
the main road to somewhere is about three-quarters of a mile to
the northward."</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean, old man?"</p>

<p>"I assure you it's a fact; after going through some of the
most awful scrub I ever met with I came to an 'illigant' cleared
road, gas lamps, mile-stones, and probably bridges and
public-houses."</p>

<p>"Well we'd better go there. I wonder you came back before
visiting one of the pubs."</p>

<p>"I didn't exactly see all that I have stated, but I really
have no doubt of their existence," returned Brown. "Joking apart,
there really is a cleared track out there, but we'll have to out
a road to get the horses there."</p>

<p>"Well this beats all; however, it's getting late so we had
better shape. Charley, you and Billy go ahead with the tomahawks;
we'll dodge the horses along after you."</p>

<p>It took some time and labour to negotiate the distance
indicated by Brown, but about an hour before sundown, to the
astonishment of three of them, they stood upon what was evidently
a cleared track, about the width of an ordinary bridle track.
Morton examined the limbs cut off, and pointed out that it was
all done with a stone tomahawk. Billy was looking for tracks, but
none had been made since the last thunderstorm had fallen.</p>

<p>"It's running westward; I suppose it's all right, but this
beats my experience. What say you, Brown?" said Morton.</p>

<p>"Forward, Cortes, while the light lasts," was the reply of
that individual.</p>

<p>The progress was now easy, for the track had been most
carefully cleared, and the horses, all old stagers, marched along
in single file without any trouble. Darkness, however, fell, and
the scrub around was still unchanged.</p>

<p>"Morton," said Brown, breaking the silence, "I've an
idea."</p>

<p>"Good gracious, man, have you at last found one in this
scrub?"</p>

<p>"Don't be funny, Macdowall Stewart; but I should not be
surprised at any moment to meet a first-class funeral coming
along."</p>

<p>"You're as bad as Billy."</p>

<p>"That's just it; it strikes me those mummies, etc., we
saw down there have all been carted along this road,
from&mdash;wherever we're going to. That's the reason it's
so carefully cleared."</p>

<p>"Jove! You're right. Rather a surprise for the mourners if we
blunder on to them in the dark."</p>

<p>"Just what we want to avoid; there's some thing ahead no white
man has yet heard of, and if we can sneak along without being
seen so much the better."</p>

<p>"What do you think is the best thing to do? We can't budge a
step off the track, and if unluckily there's a funeral ceremony
on to night we shall fall foul of them all the same."</p>

<p>"We'll go on until we get a bit of open country and then pull
off and wait for day light."</p>

<p>"All serene, but our tracks will let on."</p>

<p>The conversation had been carried on without halting, and in
silence the march continued until midnight, when a low whistle
from Morton gave a signal to pull up.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 3</h3>

<p class="chaphead">A Midnight Halt&mdash;A Mysterious
Procession&mdash;Sudden Dispersion<br>
And Flight&mdash;Open Country Once More, and Another Mystery
Ahead</p>

<br>

<p class="first">AS well as could be made out in the gloom cast
by the scrub they had reached a small break, and Morton wheeling
off, the horses followed, and the party dismounted, as the leader
judged, some two hundred yards from the track. Morton gave his
orders in low tones, for the atmosphere of awe and mystery
affected everybody. There was no grass, so the horses were just
relieved of their packs and tied to trees; then the men lay down
on their blankets without making a fire, and, save for the
occasional snort of a horse, the scrub was as silent as
before.</p>

<p>Not for long. It seemed to Brown that he had scarcely closed
his eyes when the camp was aroused by a distant melancholy cry.
No one spoke; all were intently listening; the cry sounded again,
louder, nearer; and in a chorus of many voices.</p>

<p>"What bad luck!" whispered Morton, to his friend; "a day or
two sooner or later and we would have been right."</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the plaintive wailing noise, and the
gleam of firesticks was visible. It was a most uncomfortable
sensation that our adventurers experienced, lying motionless in
the gloomy scrub, listening to this uncanny procession passing.
They were well armed, but the sights they had encountered had
been so much out of the ordinary routine as to make even such old
hands as Morton and Brown slightly nervous.</p>

<p>Charley was naturally greatly excited, whilst Billy was
"larding the earth" with the perspiration of abject superstitious
terror. The party of natives were now opposite, but a short
distance away, and by the number of firesticks there seemed to be
a good many in company; every now and then the wild wail or chant
kept breaking out, and the shuffling noise of their bare feet was
distinctly audible during the silent intervals.</p>

<p>They had almost passed the hidden watchers when the procession
was interrupted by a discordant shout from the leaders; a babble
of voices followed, the firesticks gathered together, and were
then dashed on the ground and extinguished; then, came the noise
of flying feet back along the track, dying away into silence.</p>

<p>"Saw our tracks!" said Brown with a disgusted sigh, breaking
the spell that held them all quiet.</p>

<p>"How could they see them in the dark?" asked Charley.</p>

<p>"They could both feel them, and smell them," returned Morton.
"The track is caked hard from the last thunderstorm, and all our
horses walking one after another would cut it up soft, and of
course with their bare feet they'd tell the difference directly.
And the scent would be as plain as possible at this time in the
morning even to one of us. What's the time, Brown?"</p>

<p>Brown struck a match,</p>

<p>"Three. It will be breaking day soon after five; let's wait
till then."</p>

<p>"Why?" said Morton.</p>

<p>"We might as well get on while it's cool; there's the remains
of the moon just rising."</p>

<p>"Why? You think with me that it was a funeral. Now, I should
like to know what they did with the corpse; they never carried it
away at that pace."</p>

<p>"Never thought of that," returned Morton. "Yes, we might pick
up some information if we wait. We'll make a fire and have
breakfast."</p>

<p>The time soon passed in discussing the strange scene just
witnessed and the possible result of their trip. Morton reminded
Brown of the Freemasons that Stuart met in the interior, and
Charley, who had not heard the former conversation, was
enlightened as to the probable meaning of what had passed.</p>

<p>As soon as daylight was strong enough the investigation
commenced. On the track where it had been hastily thrown lay the
body of a tall old man fastened on to a rude litter made of
saplings. The forehead was smeared with red pigment, and a
triangle in white was inscribed on the dusky breast. Brown gave a
low whistle.</p>

<p>"That's a thing I never saw blacks draw before," he said to
Morton.</p>

<p>"Nor I. He's a fine-looking old boy. What a long white beard
he's got for a nigger!"</p>

<p>The body was fastened to the litter with rude strips of
currajong bark; and they were turning away after noting all the
details, when Brown suggested that they might move him off the
track.</p>

<p>"You know," he explained, "we might come hustling along the
track in the dark in as big a hurry as those fellows did and
tumble over the old gentleman."</p>

<p>The litter and its burden were shifted a few paces in the
scrub, and full of expectation the party started on their
interrupted way. The country soon became more open, and as it did
so the track they had been following became less marked; it was
still, however, quite plain for any bushman to follow easily.</p>

<p>At noon, to the great relief of the horses, they came to a
small pool of rain water and some fairly good grass. Here they
turned out for a long spell.</p>

<p>"Question is," said Brown, when the usual discussion
commenced, "where did those nigs camp? No sign of them here. By
the way, any gins' tracks among them, Billy?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the boy, "all together blackfellow."</p>

<p>"Must be more water ahead, and I hope so, for this won't stand
in another week, and we want some to come back on. Now I'm going
aloft on the lookout," said Morton.</p>

<p>Charley looked at him curiously as he slung the field glass
over his shoulder, and taking a tomahawk proceeded to an
exceptionally tall bloodwood tree near the camp. At the foot he
took off his boots, and cutting niches into the trunk like a
blackfellow was soon up amongst the top branches. Ensconcing
himself firmly he took a comprehensive sweep around, and then
directed his attention to the westward. "Below there!" he
shouted, after a lengthened scrutiny.</p>

<p>"Hi, hi, sir!" returned Charley. "Brown! Will your long legs
bring you up here?"</p>

<p>"Will it hold us both?" demanded Brown.</p>

<p>"Yes, safe as houses."</p>

<p>In a short time Brown was up alongside his friend, and a very
earnest discussion followed extremely tantalising to Charley
below. After taking a compass bearing to some distant object they
descended; and Charley, who was already barefooted, immediately
attempted the ascent, slipping ignominiously down after getting
up two or three steps, to Billy's huge delight. With the black
boy's assistance he managed to reach the first branches, and from
there gained the perch occupied by Morton on the top.</p>

<p>What did he see when he got there?</p>

<p>The forest to the westward came to an abrupt end, and beyond
stretched a wide gray plain, bounded by something that Charley
could not make out, and had evidently puzzled Morton and Brown.
It was not water, although it looked something like it; it was a
broad sheet of pale blue, glistening in places under the sun's
rays, and beyond, above a quivering haze, was a dark object like
a distant ridge.</p>

<p>"What name, Billy?" said Charley to the black boy who had
climbed up with him.</p>

<p>"Water?"</p>

<p>"No water," said Billy decidedly. "Water here, close up," he
added, pointing to the edge of the forest.</p>

<p>"What name then?" repeated Charley.</p>

<p>"Me think it mud, where water bin go bung," was the
blackfellow's opinion; and with this they both descended.</p>

<p>"Well, Charley, what do you make of it?" said Morton. "Billy
thinks it's mud where the water has dried up," returned Charley,
as he had no opinion of his own to give.</p>

<p>"And Billy's right I believe, it's the bed of a dry salt lake,
but we'll get on to the edge of the timber and camp."</p>

<p>On the margin of the plain they came to some fine lagoons and
good feed; but nothing could be seen of the mysterious object
ahead, unless from the top of a tree. About the lagoons they
found abundant traces of the natives, and it was evidently a main
camping place. Many of the trees were marked with triangles,
which sign considerably puzzled both the elder travellers.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 4</h3>

<p class="chaphead">The Limestone Plain&mdash;The Devil's
Tracks&mdash;A Night March</p>
<br>

<p class="first">THE morning found them early on the alert, and
still following the faint track that led towards the dark ridge
visible beyond the blue expanse. Before sunrise this supposed dry
lake had been visible from the camp, but as the sun rose it
disappeared, nor did they again sight it till nearly eight
o'clock.</p>

<p>At ten they were close to it, and all doubt as to its
character was set at rest. They pulled up, not at the edge of a
dry lake, but of an unbroken sheet of limestone rock. Nothing was
visible but this bluish-gray sea, over which a heated haze was
hovering; the dark line beyond, resembling a ridge, had vanished;
and the wind that blew in their faces across the surface of this
strange plain was as hot as though it came from a furnace.</p>

<p>Morton turned and rode along the edge of the rock to where the
track joined it, for they had left it for the last few yards. He
whistled and the others came up. The track still continued right
on across the rock, but it was now indicated by other means. On
the surface of the limestone had been scratched or chipped with
infinite care an imitation of human footsteps, or rather more
than human footsteps, for the gigantic tracks were twice the size
of a man's, and the stride indicated to correspond. Side by side,
about six feet apart, these two awful foot-steps strode into the
quivering mirage.</p>

<p>"I've seen that mark before on the West coast," said Brown,
"You notice there are six toes to it. It's supposed to be the
devil's footprint."</p>

<p>"By Jove, what work it must have been!" returned Morton. "But
what shall we do now?"</p>

<p>"Go back to the lagoon for this afternoon, and hold a council
of war; no good stopping here."</p>

<p>This was cordially agreed to, and a return to their last
night's camping ground was at once made.</p>

<p>"We can't take the horses across there;" was affirmed by Brown
when the discussion commenced.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, and I doubt if we can cross on foot in the
daytime. We should be baked to death with the rock underneath and
the sun overhead. We should get no shade to rest under."</p>

<p>"It's quite agreed, we must follow this thing out?" said
Brown.</p>

<p>"Quite!" returned the two.</p>

<p>"Then the first thing to consider is what to do with the
horses and packs. Will they be safe here?"</p>

<p>"I think so," replied Morton. "I don't think there are any
natives behind us; they are beyond that limestone somewhere ahead
of us, so that nobody will come here without our knowing it, for
they only use the one track seemingly, and we shall be on that.
We'll plant the traps and leave the horses hobbled; they won't
stir from here before we come back, the feed's too good. Let's
dig a hole this evening to plant the things in."</p>

<p>This plan, on further consideration, was approved of; a light
pick and shovel had not been forgotten in the pack intended for
water digging, and a grave, as Charley called it, was soon made
and the impedimenta buried. They made their packs as light as
possible, but with three days' rations, firearms, ammunition, and
water bags, they felt heavy enough, and all hands devoutly hoped
they would be off the rock before daylight.</p>

<p>With all the despatch they made they did not reach the edge of
the rock before twelve, but it mattered little, as the surface
was only then getting cool, and would have been unbearable any
earlier. Billy was sent first with bare feet, he being trusted to
follow the track by feeling when they strayed off it, as he would
then cross the rough surface made by the sculptured tracks, the
remainder of the limestone being almost as smooth as marble.</p>

<p>It was a weird and weary tramp across this rock by the light
of the stars, with vague darkness all around them. None of them
felt inclined to speak, and an awful silence reigned everywhere.
A sickly moon rose just before daylight, and its faint beams cast
the long shadows of the travellers across the gleaming surface of
the limestone. The thought in the minds of the three men was the
same&mdash;what would daylight show them? Billy plodded along
mechanically; most of the time he was half asleep. Daylight came
at last, and the black line that they had seen from the tree top
gradually came into view, apparently not far ahead; and each felt
grateful that he had not to encounter the force of the sun on the
face of the naked rock.</p>

<p>When it was broad daylight the dark line resolved itself under
the glasses into a row of basaltic boulders, with some bushes
growing in their clefts and a bottle tree here and there on their
summits.</p>

<p>"We shall be there before it is hot," said Morton thankfully
as he closed the glasses; "let's push on."</p>

<p>They did so, and before the sun had attained much power found
themselves amongst the boulders. The track led straight into a
gap, and on one side a huge block of stone, supported by two
others, made a rude cave, under which the weary men gladly took
shelter after their toilsome tramp. Evidently it was a halting
place for the blacks, for the remains of fires were about, and a
supply of firewood, which came in very handy for the tired men to
cook their breakfast with.</p>

<p>A satisfactory meal and a smoke being finished, the situation
was reviewed. Behind them lay the bare expanse of rock just
crossed, and before them the unknown. Now, too, they would have
to keep a keen look out for lurking foes, for in amongst these
boulders every step was fraught with danger, especially as the
blacks knew of their approach; and it was evident that they were
trespassing on tabooed ground.</p>

<p>The future movements of the party were now, as might be
supposed, a matter of serious consideration, and Brown and Morton
were in earnest discussion when a loud report like a clap of
thunder suddenly startled the little company to their feet. A low
rumbling followed that seemed to shake the very rocks. Hurrying
outside nothing was seen that could possibly have caused the
strange noise; the sky was cloudless, the air still and sultry.
Suddenly Billy pointed to the westward.</p>

<p>"Fire jump up," he said. A puff of white smoke, or vapour, was
rising seemingly only a short distance from them. Silently they
watched it ascend and disperse.</p>

<p>"Blacks here have artillery apparently," said Brown. "Salute
in honour of our arrival."</p>

<p>Nothing more following, they returned to the cave, leaving
Charley at the entrance on the look out.</p>

<p>"If these fellows know nothing about the effect of firearms,"
said Morton, "we may be able to establish a funk; they may have
heard of them only from the other tribes."</p>

<p>"I don't think they have much communication with the other
tribes by the look of it, but, if they live amongst these rocks,
what on earth do they exist on?&mdash;for there's no game
here."</p>

<p>"Well, all we can do is to keep a sharp look out and our
powder dry&mdash;What's up?"</p>

<p>"Here's the corpse!" cried Charley, falling back from the
entrance in amazement.</p>

<p>Billy gave an awful yell; the others started to their feet as
a tall native coolly walked into the cave, and squatted down on
the ground. It certainly was enough to give them all a fright,
for the visitor, in outward appearance, greatly resembled the
dead man left in the scrub. A second glance, however, showed
points of difference which proved him to be a denizen of the
earth; he was marked with the white triangle on the breast, and
the red smear on the forehead, but was naked and unarmed, whilst
his manner showed no trace of fear.</p>

<p>Recovering themselves somewhat, Morton lugged Billy forward to
see if he could converse with the new comer. This proceeding,
however, did not suit their visitor, for he addressed a furious
tirade at Mr. Button in some unknown tongue, winding up by
violently spitting at him.</p>

<p>Billy slunk back scared, and the native rising took Brown by
the arm and led him to the entrance; pointing alternately forward
and backwards he made signs for them to turn back, and not to go
on. Brown returned by signs that they must go on. The blackfellow
shook his head vigorously, and then held up his hand motioning
them to listen.</p>

<p>Again the loud report was heard, and a puff of vapour ascended
as before. To the apparent surprise of the native, the whites
showed no alarm, and Brown taking his carbine stepped back, and
fired it into the air. The black gave a decided start, and
trembled a little, but stood his ground; then his mind seemed to
change, and, making a sign to Brown to stay, he strode off and
disappeared behind the surrounding rocks.</p>

<p>"Is he coming back, do you think?" said Brown.</p>

<p>"I think so," replied Morton. "He's a fine fellow, with
plenty of pluck."</p>

<p>"Then we'll give him twenty minutes' grace&mdash;but
here he comes, and all his sisters and his cousins and
his aunts."</p>

<p>Sure enough their former visitor appeared, accompanied by some
half-dozen others, similarly painted and all unarmed. He spoke a
few words to them, and pointed towards Brown, upon whom they
gazed curiously.</p>

<p>"Now, then, Brown," said Morton, "you're the star; evidently
they want an exhibition."</p>

<p>Brown, who had reloaded his carbine, fired in the air again.
The fresh arrivals showed more alarm than the first man had, some
of them squatted hastily down and all started with fear.</p>

<p>"It appears to me, Brown, that they consider you 'brother
belonging' to this noise ahead," remarked Morton.</p>

<p>"It looks like it, and we must keep up the pleasing fiction,
for these fellows have us on toast in amongst these rocks. I
wonder how many more there are round about."</p>

<p>"Let's see if we can go on now," said Morton. On Brown
indicating their wish to proceed, the most ready acquiescence was
displayed, and at a few words from the native who had first
arrived the others showed by signs their intention to carry the
strangers' packs.</p>

<p>Before starting, however, names were interchanged, that being
generally found the easiest steps towards intimacy. Brown,
Morton, and Charley (or Sarley) were soon picked up, and the
chief, as he appeared to be, introduced himself as Columberi,
which, of course, was at once turned into Columbus by Brown, and
the oldest blackfellow amongst the others was named Yarlow.</p>

<p>With Columbus appropriately in the lead, the march commenced,
the tracks winding in and out of the rocks in a very intricate
fashion. For nearly five miles they kept on, although in a
straight line they would not probably have traversed more than
two, and at last arrived at an open space surrounded by bottle
trees, and from the number of humpies, built of mud and grass,
apparently the headquarters of the tribe. Here they halted. About
twenty more blacks were sitting about, who at first made a show
of taking to their heels, but a call from Columbus brought them
back. Selecting a shady tree, Brown indicated that their swags
should be brought up, and this being done he remarked:</p>

<p>"What do you say to a feed, and then getting Christopher here
to show us the ropes?"</p>

<p>"Just as well," returned Brown; "we must take everything as a
matter of course, and show no surprise." Billy made a fire, and
the quarts were put on to boil, a proceeding which interested the
spectators greatly. Brown by signs then invited Columbus to sit
down, and presented him with a piece of damper thickly coated
with sugar, at the same time eating a piece himself to inspire
confidence.</p>

<p>The native started to eat in a slow and doubtful manner, but
after a bite or two finished it off with great gusto and
indicated a wish for more. The quarts now bubbled up, and the
blacks with one accord emitted, a united "ha!" and pointed to the
westward; evidently the boiling water bore some resemblance to
something in that direction. Columbus now described a mark in the
dust like a half-circle, and pointed in the direction they had
come.</p>

<p>"He means the horse tracks they saw," said Morton after a
pause. He nodded vigorously to the old man, who continued his
pantomime by lying on his back as though dead. Morton nodded,
again and patted the ground pointing backwards to indicate that
the corpse was still there. Columbus then called the other blacks
aside, and after a long talk about a dozen of them drew off and
disappeared amongst the surrounding boulders.</p>

<p>"We must follow up this burning mountain business," said Brown
as he meditatively ate his dinner; "now old Columbus has disposed
of his private affairs perhaps he will take us there."</p>

<p>"Call him back and let's make inquiries; see if he'll eat
beef."</p>

<p>The chieftain approaching, Brown offered him a piece of salt
beef. He examined it curiously, and then without any demur ate it
in the most appreciative manner. He then pointed to Charley, and
made signs as though cutting with a knife which for a time were
quite unintelligible.</p>

<p>"Blessed if he doesn't mean to ask if you're good to eat,"
said Brown at last.</p>

<p>He shook his head, and the native appeared both surprised and
disappointed.</p>

<p>On their indicating their wish to proceed in the direction of
the strange reports, he rose and led the way. The whites only
took their carbines, as they felt assured that as yet their
coming was too novel for the blacks to interfere with their
belongings. They had but a short distance to go.</p>

<p>Rounding a rugged wall of basalt they saw stretched before
them a singular and striking scene. At their feet was a large
circular shallow depression, about a mile in circumference,
filled with pools of clear water divided one from another by
narrow ridges of rock. In the centre of this depression was a
hill of small elevation with a flat top; not a vestige of green
weed was to be seen about the water, nothing but bare rock.
Without stopping, their guide led the way along one of the narrow
strips of basalt intersecting the water.</p>

<p>"Keep your feet," said Morton as they followed him, "for it
strikes me that water's scalding hot."</p>

<p>Warned by this, the whites carefully continued their course to
the central hill, Columbus mounted it, and then pointed down.
They were on the edge of a crater.</p>

<p>At no great distance below was a mass of seething boiling mud.
The crater had lip-like fractures in various parts, and to one of
these their guide now directed their attention, at the same time
motioning to them to stand back from the edge. The water in the
pool at the back of the lip was curiously ruffled; presently it
assumed the appearance of boiling, and rising suddenly poured
over the edge of the crater into the molten mud beneath. A
deafening report followed, and the rocks on which the party
crouched trembled again. Then came a rush of steam, and all was
still once more.</p>

<p>By a great effort the strangers had preserved their coolness,
and looked on the display unmoved; then in response to Brown they
discharged the carbines simultaneously, an act which nearly made
Columbus topple into the crater.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 5</h3>

<p class="chaphead">
Columbus Takes A Fancy To Charley&mdash; The Secret Of<br>
The Limestone Cliff&mdash; A Feast Of Cannibals&mdash;<br>
A White Man With The Blacks&mdash; Initiation Of Recruits&mdash;<br>
Charley Makes A Proposition.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">BY the language of signs they were given to
understand that the rocks through which they had found their way
extended in every direction. Another low elevation a short
distance away resembling a limestone cliff was noticed, but about
this their guide, who had now recovered his composure, could, or
apparently would, not afford them any information.</p>

<p>After a more lengthened examination of the strange
surroundings they returned to their camp in the open space, which
they found deserted by the natives. Columbus, however, showed no
signs of leaving them, and the whites, with due regard to
strategic purposes, pitched their tent and made themselves as
comfortable as circumstances allowed.</p>

<p>"The thing that puzzles me," said Brown, after all
arrangements had been completed, "is&mdash;What do these natives
live on? Columbus, whom we have feasted on strange dainties,
shows no desire of leaving us; but the others are all away,
evidently in search of grub. There are no gins visible; perhaps
they are away hunting, but I doubt it, for within a hundred miles
of here there isn't a feed for a bandicoot."</p>

<p>"I don't understand it either," returned Morton, "but we'll
stop and see it out any way. Charley, our friend Columbus has
taken quite a fancy to you; he can't take his eyes off you."</p>

<p>Charley looked very uncomfortable at the chaff, and muttered
something about a "nigger's cheek;" but it was quite evident that
the native had transferred all his admiration from Brown to
Charley.</p>

<p>Whilst still talking and discussing the situation a sound like
a distant uproar of voices be came apparent, and Columbus
commenced to evince signs of uneasiness. The sound came from the
direction of the limestone cliffs, and grew louder and more
distinct as they listened.</p>

<p>All the party naturally rose to their feet, although the
native made energetic signs to them to keep quiet. After a short
time the shouting became stationary, and it was evidently not
intended as an attack upon them, or such loud warning would not
have been given.</p>

<p>"Shall we go and see what's up?" said Morton.</p>

<p>"We'll fix the direction, any way," returned Brown, and they
proceeded to clamber up one of the high boulders by which they
were surrounded, although Columbus evidently pro tested against
the proceeding. From the top of the boulder they could make out
the summit of the limestone cliffs, and ascertained that the
uproar certainly came from there, and moreover that the shrill
cries of gins mingled with the many voices.</p>

<p>It was well on towards sundown, and after a short conference
Brown and Morton determined to defer further explorations until
the next day, so they returned to their camp, Columbus, who
seemed much relieved by the proceeding, now made signs for
Charley to accompany him in the direction they had been just
looking. At the same time he made it plainly apparent that
Charley was to come alone.</p>

<p>"I'll go, Frank," he said to Morton. "Let me go and have all
the honour and glory."</p>

<p>Morton and Brown both replied in the negative, and Brown
intimated to Columbus that to-morrow Charley should go, but now
it was nearly night and he wanted a sleep. This seemed to satisfy
the blackfellow, who now evidently wanted to get away himself,
and presently, as soon as he thought the attention of the party
was not directed towards him, he disappeared as mysteriously as
he had arrived.</p>

<p>"I have not got to the bottom of this little affair yet," said
Morton; "but I think we shall to-night. What do you say to paying
a visit to these cliffs as soon as it is pitch dark; I have the
bearing?"</p>

<p>"The very thing I was going to suggest, my dear Flinders.
Charley, it strikes me that our new friend wants to make long pig
of you."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Charley.</p>

<p>"Well, a favourite dish amongst some natives who have an
acquired taste for human flesh."</p>

<p>"Do you think he's a cannibal?" said the boy, rather
aghast.</p>

<p>"I should be sorry to slander a stranger, but he certainly
looks something like it."</p>

<p>As soon as it was quite dark the party set out on their way to
the cliffs, which they judged to be about a mile distant; it was
a difficult matter shaping a course by the stars amongst the
gloom cast by the surrounding boulders, but an occasional murmur
of sound helped them on, and after scrambling and twisting about
they found themselves near the low cliffs.</p>

<p>Here Billy was told to strip and reconnoitre, and his black
figure was lost amongst the rocks almost before he seemed to have
made a step. He was absent nearly half an hour; then a subdued
whistle announced his return, and in a low voice he communicated
to Morton the result of his investigations.</p>

<p>About four or five hundred yards from where they were waiting
there was a cave in the cliff, and the blacks it appears were in
there. Billy had gone close to the entrance, but could see only a
light in the distance, for, according to him, "hole been go long
way."</p>

<p>Under Billy's guidance they soon reached the cave entrance,
and found it to be a kind of tunnel evidently leading to a large
cave, for a red glare of firelight came round an angle, and the
sound of many chattering voices was audible.</p>

<p>"Shall we go on?" said Morton in a whisper.</p>

<p>"No, wait a minute," replied Brown; "it strikes me there's
another entrance to this place; they must have a lot of fire
going, but yet the place is not full of smoke. I can smell the
fire, but that's all. I think there must be an opening in the
top, let's send Billy up to see."</p>

<p>The face of the cliff was easily climbed, being mostly
detached rooks that had fallen down, and very soon Billy came
back and reported that "fire come up alonga top."</p>

<p>One after the other the adventurers ascended and found
themselves on a rocky plateau full of fissures and holes, through
some of which a bright light was streaming.</p>

<p>Approaching this portion carefully on their hands and knees,
they soon found a fissure through which they could gaze with
safety on one of the strangest scenes ever witnessed in
Australia.</p>

<p>The cavern below them was seemingly of some size, and was well
lighted by a number of fires, the smoke from which somewhat
annoyed the unseen spectators. A far larger number of blacks were
assembled than had been visible before, and many of them were
armed and painted, being also marked with the red smear and white
triangle. One large group was composed of some twenty, or thirty
young men and women; they were huddled together, apparently much
frightened, and had no marks whatever upon their bodies.</p>

<p>Columbus was soon recognised squatting at one of the fires
with some of the other old men, and, like all but the group of
boys and girls, busily engaged in eating. Morton felt his arm
clutched suddenly and tightly, and Brown hoarsely whispered in
his ear, "It is meat they are eating; but what meat?"</p>

<p>Morton was struck with horror as he listened, and the truth
flashed across his mind. It was a feast of cannibals they were
overlooking. The armed natives had just returned from a foray,
and the trembling group in the corner were prisoners destined to
death.</p>

<p>An awful feeling of horror came over the whole party as they
realised their situation and possible fate. In a wilderness of
savage rocks, surrounded by an expanse of desert, almost in the
hands of some fifty or sixty fierce cannibals&mdash;no wonder the
first thought of each was to slip quietly back the way he had
come under cover of the night, and leave the natives to their
former obscurity.</p>

<p>Their natural courage soon returned. At present they were
masters of the situation; with their breech-loaders they could
have shot down half the natives, helpless in the cavern below, if
so inclined. But, with all their horror of the scene, affairs did
not seem to justify armed intervention just then.</p>

<p>Contenting themselves with being spectators only, they watched
the doings in the cave, at times having to stifle a cough brought
on by a puff of smoke from the burning wood fires, or a time the
repast below went on with the usual accompaniments of a blacks'
camp, but as it came to an end it was evident that some
extraordinary occurrence was going to take place.</p>

<p>Gradually the old men mustered together around Columbus, and
the other blacks proceeded to combine all the fires into one
large one near the wall of the cavern. The added blaze gave to
view a huge figure painted on the rock; it was the semblance of a
human form, but the head, instead of being represented round, was
grotesquely shaped like a triangle. At the foot of the painting
was a rock, and, while the rank and file of the natives grouped
themselves in a circle around the fire, Columbus and some others
retired into the darkness out of sight of the watchers.</p>

<p>The chant of a corroboree now commenced, and the blacks slowly
circled round the fire for a short time, suddenly ceasing and
breaking into a half ring, with the open part towards the grim
figure painted on the wall. Then Columbus and the others
appeared, supporting between them a striking and venerable
figure&mdash;an old, old man, with snow-white hair and beard,
bent so double that, as he hobbled along supporting himself on
two short sticks, he appeared like some strange animal walking on
four legs.</p>

<p>This decrepit being was carefully helped and guided to the
stone beneath the figure, and seated thereon; then the others
squatted on the ground, the blacks in the half ring remaining
quietly standing. The old man seated on the block was now full in
view of the whites above, and the brilliant rays of the fire fell
directly on him. Brown and Morton turned to each other with the
same smothered exclamation on their lips, "By Jove, it's a white
man!"</p>

<p>Almost as dark as the savages around, painted like them with a
hideous red smear on the forehead and a white triangle on the
breast, the experienced whites felt sure that before them they
saw one of their own race. Apparently the venerable being was
either blind or nearly so; and he kept turning his face
restlessly from side to side.</p>

<p>From the half circle of blacks then arose a shout or chant
that sounded like the repetition of "Mur! Fee! Mur! Fee!"</p>

<p>"Hulloo! we're amongst countrymen," whispered Brown; "that
sounds awfully like Murphy."</p>

<p>A terrible noise was now commenced like a hundred mad gongs
let loose. Four blacks came forward beating furiously with clubs
on what appeared to be sheets of metal. At the sound the old man
on the rock smiled and leant forward, and, stretching forth his
trembling hands, appeared to say something. At this Columbus
arose, and, followed by the gong-beaters, went over to the throng
of trembling captives. After a short inspection he selected a
young gin and pulled her along by the hand towards the old man,
followed still by the gong-beaters.</p>

<p>The poor wretch seemed stupefied with fear, and when in front
of the stone she sank down, trembling visibly. Columbus drew
back, and the gong-beaters, dancing madly round, made a still
more deafening din. Suddenly one of them, instead of striking his
gong, dealt the unfortunate creature a terrible blow on the head,
the others followed his example, and in an instant the wretched
gin lay dead on the ground.</p>

<p>The effect of this scene on the whites above was maddening.
Charley had his gun to his shoulder, but Morton stopped him in
time. The gin was killed before interference was possible.</p>

<p>"Come away," said Brown, "let's have a confab. I'm sick of
watching those brutes."</p>

<p>They scrambled away a short distance, and after a pause Brown
spoke.</p>

<p>"We've got our work cut out, there's no doubt about that. We
must find out all about that white man if possible, and we must
let those poor devils go and give these cannibals a lesson."</p>

<p>"In justice to our friend Columbus," said Morton, "let me
remark that 'these cannibals' are only following up what they
have been taught; they have no horror of the thing like we have.
At the same time, the man who lifts his hand&mdash;or nulla
nulla&mdash;against a woman is unworthy the name of a British
sailor, etc., etc."</p>

<p>"Are you convinced that is a white man?" said Charley.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Brown, "but who he is is another question. He
appears to be blind, deaf, and imbecile. I suppose we must fall
back upon Leichhardt."</p>

<p>"He's been a big man when younger and erect," said Morton;
"far bigger than Leichhardt was. However, we'll suppose it to be
one of his party&mdash;he looks old enough."</p>

<p>Brown gave vent to a low whistle.</p>

<p>"By jingo, supposing that was 'Murphy' they were shouting. I
believe there was a man of that name in the lost party."</p>

<p>"We shall find out I hope soon. Meantime, what next?"</p>

<p>"I know," said Charley; "let's go back to camp. You promised
Columbus I should go with him to-morrow. Well, I'll go and find
out all about it."</p>

<p>Morton put his hand on Charley's. "It's a real plucky bid, my
boy, after what we've just seen; but do you think I could let you
go? Why you'd be cooked and eaten in no time."</p>

<p>"Hold on!" said Brown; "I'm full of ideas just now; let me
think this one out; there's something in what Charley says."</p>

<p>"Now, oracle, as soon as you're ready," returned Brown.</p>

<p>"Well, I may be right or wrong, but my notion is that Columbus
does not want to eat Charley. Why, they've got enough rations for
a month. I think that they keep this old man as a sort of fetish,
and that Columbus and a few of the knowing old fellows see that
he must soon die. Now they want Charley to take his place." Brown
paused triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I verily believe you've hit it," said Morton. "You ought
always to live here, considering the amount of intellect you are
developing."</p>

<p>At this moment a renewed din once more pealed up from the
cave, and the party crawled out find out the cause. The
gong-beaters, Columbus, and his privy councillors were parading
the captives, and the spectators shuddered as they looked down
upon hideous remains of the late feast scattered about the sandy
floor of the cavern.</p>

<p>This time a fine looking young man was selected and marched up
to the venerable figure on the stone. The gong-beaters fell back,
and Columbus and his companions proceeded to smear the youth's
forehead with red pigment, and marked the cabalistic white
triangle on his breast. He was then led away to a dark corner out
of sight of the watchers. Brown muttered a deep oath.</p>

<p>"That's what has been puzzling me," he growled to Moreton,
"how they kept their numbers up; of course they recruit from the
best looking prisoners."</p>

<p>"See! they are going to select another," whispered his friend;
"bet you two figs of tobacco they choose that tall fellow with
his hair tied in a knot."</p>

<p>"Done! I'll back the nuggety fellow along side him."</p>

<p>Brown lost, the tall fellow being marched out to receive the
marks of the cannibalistic brotherhood.</p>

<p>Columbus and the others now assisted the old man to hobble
away, and the blacks squatted down by the fire and relit fresh
ones about the ground.</p>

<p>"Get back to camp," said Morton; "the fun is over for
to-night."</p>

<p>Scrambling down the cliff, and using every precaution, the
party soon regained their camp, which they found as deserted as
they left it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 6</h3>

<p class="first">TIRED out with their exertions and the continued
night work the party slept soundly, and awoke at dawn to find the
camp as calm and silent as if no such tragedies as they had
witnessed were ever enacted in the neighbour hood.</p>

<p>"Terribly sultry, is it not?" said Morton; "I suppose it is
these rocks retain the heat so."</p>

<p>"It seems in the air. Look what a haze there is. I don't
think I ever felt it so hot at this time of day. What do
you say to a walk to the crater after breakfast?"</p>

<p>Charley called out just then that the meal was ready, and
during its progress the plan of action for the day was discussed
and agreed upon. On arriving at the crater they found it in a
great state of activity, most of the pools were in violent
commotion, and constantly overflowing into the crater, causing a
succession of reports.</p>

<p>Returning to the camp they found that Columbus and two or
three of the old men had arrived, all looking as mild and gentle
as if they habitually lived upon milk and water.</p>

<p>"Look at the old scoundrel," said Morton; "his mouth is
watering to see us roasting on the coals."</p>

<p>"I think he only wants to get rid of us and to induce us to
leave Charley behind. Now let's try him," returned Brown.</p>

<p>Preparations were then apparently made for departure, Charley
intimating to Columbus that he intended to go with him. The
native appeared hugely delighted, and when the time for departure
arrived neither he nor the others could restrain their
expressions of joy.</p>

<p>With their swags on their shoulders Morton, Brown, and Billy
strode off along the track by which they had come, ostentatiously
waving their hands to Charley. No sooner, however, were they
hidden from the camp than Morton and Billy slipped aside amongst
the rocks, whilst Brown plodded steadily on, making as much noise
as possible.</p>

<p>For nearly a quarter of a mile he kept his course and then
stepped on one side and stood quietly behind a boulder. After
five minutes' waiting the sound of footsteps was heard, and a
native came along, evidently following the track to make sure
that the white men left the place, for he was unarmed and
alone.</p>

<p>He was close to Brown before he saw him, and then with a
frightened cry sprang away, but he was too late. Brown had hold
of him, and exerting all his uncommon strength threw him heavily
down amongst the rooks, where he lay stunned and quiet. Brown
waited patiently for some time, but nothing could be heard; one
native only had evidently been sent to watch them away. Leaving
his swag in a secure hiding-place, Brown then cautiously directed
his course towards the limestone cliff, using every precaution to
escape being seen.</p>

<p>He arrived in sight of the mouth of the cave after a toilsome
journey, and after cautiously reconnoitering gave a low whistle.
There was no answer, but voices could be heard approaching, and
peering carefully out Brown saw Columbus, Charley, and three
other old men emerge from the rocks and enter the cave.</p>

<p>At the same moment a low whistle sounded near him, to which he
instantly replied, and in a few minutes Morton and Billy came
creeping silently along and joined him.</p>

<p>"It's splendid," said Morton. "Columbus took Charley on one
side amongst the rocks, then he gave a signal and all the blacks
came along the track and squatted down in the open space where we
were camped. Columbus and three old men then went away with
Charley, whom they carefully kept hidden, and I think those are
all we have to deal with; so come along for I can't bear to let
that boy stop alone with them long, although I think he's safe
enough."</p>

<p>"We'll just rush the four of them, and then take our time
examining the place and the white man&mdash;is that it?" said
Brown; "but how we're to get away afterwards I can't make
out."</p>

<p>"We must trust to chance and our rifles; I think we can
manage, but come quick." Noiselessly they stole along the narrow
en trance that led into the inner cave and cautiously peered in
to be sure of their ground before making their attack; the
prisoners were there and the three old men, but Columbus and
Charley were absent.</p>

<p>"Quick!" whispered Brown, and sprang forward on to one, while
Morton felled the other with a nulla nulla he had picked up. The
third made a bolt for the entrance, uttering a shrill yell as he
did so, but Billy, whether through sudden fright or not, fired
his carbine at him and the black dropped dead. Startled by the
yell and report, Columbus came rushing from a dark earner of the
cave; his eyes were flashing, and all the cannibal in his nature
seemed aroused.</p>

<p>"Hit this fellow on the head!" roared Brown, releasing his
struggling prisoner and grappling with the new foe. Morton dealt
the native a stunning blow with the waddy, and then turned to
assist his comrade. Strong as Brown was, it would have been hard
work for him to subdue the infuriated Columbus without
assistance. Between them they got him down and bound him with
what straps they could master.</p>

<p>"Now for Charley!" cried Morton, turning in the direction of
the dark corner. "Some thing must have happened to him!"</p>

<p>"I'm all right, old man; come with me." And Charley showed
himself at the entrance of another and inner cave.</p>

<p>First stopping to tell Billy to wait and watch the prisoners,
and shoot them if they attempted to escape, the two friends
followed their young companion, leaving a strange scene behind
them&mdash;Billy Button on guard at the entrance of the passage,
the prostrate savages on the ground, and the captives for the
cannibal feast, who had preserved a frightened apathy throughout,
still huddled together.</p>

<p>In a smaller cave than the one they had just quitted, lighted
like it through fissures from above, the three whites found the
old man seated on the sandy floor, gazing with his half sightless
eyes at the unaccustomed figures, for this much could he
apparently discern. In a hasty whisper Charley confided to them
that he had been speaking to him, and thought he could make him
hear.</p>

<p>"Try again," said Morton eagerly.</p>

<p>Charley stooped down and shouted in the old man's ear,
"Englishman! White man!"</p>

<p>A faint gleam of intelligence seemed to illuminate the poor
creature's face, and he pointed eagerly forward with trembling
hands. The friends followed the direction of his hands and saw a
heap of objects piled in a dusky corner of the cavern, and Brown
strode forward to examine them. The attention of the other two
was confined to the ancient white man, who seemed strangely
moved. He tried to rise and speak, but could only struggle
ineffectually. It was awful to watch his convulsed features and
think what secrets he carried hidden in his breast that time had
forbidden him to reveal. At last with panting effort he half rose
up, and with a quavering hoarse voice cried distinctly, "Yes!
Englishman! White man!" and with a gasp fell back dead.</p>

<p>Awe-struck and startled, the two men looked at the body, when
suddenly a series of yells from the outer cave and the report of
a rifle aroused them all. Rushing out, the cause was instantly
explained. Billy's attention was occupied with the lady captives;
Columbus had freed himself from the straps, and the first Billy
knew about it was a blow from a waddy and a figure flying up the
passage, at whom he had hastily and vainly fired, as was evident
by the frantic shouts of Columbus outside.</p>

<p>"Get your cartridges ready; we must fight for it!" cried
Brown. Almost as he spoke there was a rush of flying feet and
furious yells at the entrance.</p>

<p>"Fire like blazes!" added Morton, setting an example that was
followed by the others until the white smoke nearly filled the
cave. Madly and fanatically the natives had dashed up the narrow
passage, but with four breech-loaders playing on them the attempt
was useless; they fell back, and for a moment there was
silence.</p>

<p>"Top! top! Look out!" suddenly screamed Billy, and none too
soon; clambering up the cliff the blacks were on the roof, and
forcing their way down in half a dozen places, so that the whites
had scant time to escape into the open air over the bodies of
those they had shot down. Outside, to their astonishment, they
found themselves unopposed, the cannibals having all made for the
top to gain the cave.</p>

<p>"What's up, Brown? You look like a ghost!" suddenly cried
Morton; "are you hit?"</p>

<p>"No, I think not, but I feel drunk, and you look sick; for
God's sake, come to the rocks."</p>

<p>An awful feeling of nausea and giddiness suddenly and
strangely attacked them all. Staggering to the rocks in front of
the cave they threw themselves down in what shade they could
find, quite regardless of their enemies. The air was like the
blast of a furnace, the reports from the crater deafening, and
the earth seemed rocking underneath them.</p>

<p>From the mouth of the cavern came a melancholy wail, the death
chant over the dead white man. By a great effort Morton rallied,
for it suddenly flashed across him what was going to happen.</p>

<p>"Come!" he shouted, making to where an overhanging boulder
afforded some slight shelter. With difficulty the others
followed. As they crouched down completely unmanned they felt the
earth rock under them, then came a terrific report that seemed to
rend the rocks asunder, and the air was filled with blinding
steam and mud. Utter silence reigned for nearly ten minutes, then
Brown gave a deep sigh and raised his head.</p>

<p>"All aboard?" he cried. "Anybody hurt?"</p>

<p>One by one they answered and stood up and looked around.</p>

<p>"That's an experience one does not get every day," remarked
Morton. "Those fellows in the cave were best off."</p>

<p>"Were they?" cried Brown excitedly. "Great God! look there."
He pointed to the cliff, and they all saw what had happened.</p>

<p>The month of the cavern had disappeared, and the shape of the
cliff was altered. The shock of earthquake they had just
experienced had brought down the roof of the cavern, and all
their late enemies lay buried beneath. The death wail they had
lately heard had been the death wail of the whole tribe; the
cannibals and their victims had shared the same fate.</p>

<p>"And the secret of that white man lies buried there too," said
Morton after an awe struck pause.</p>

<p>"Not quite," replied Brown; "I brought something away with me
that I found in that heap," and from the bosom of his shirt he
drew an old leather pocket-book. A hasty inspection showed that
it contained many pages of faded writing, but the time did not
suit for close examination. They all felt that it would be a
relief to get away from the place and proceeded to make for their
late camp.</p>

<p>"Poor old Christopher," said Morton as they trudged along; "I
feel sorry for him, he was a fine plucky fellow; do you remember
how coolly he came to meet us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and after all we had no business, according to their
idea, to interfere in their little private ceremonies. They
offered us no harm."</p>

<p>"We're lucky to get off as we did. We wouldn't have had the
ghost of a show amongst these boulders. What do you say to having
a look at the crater? it seems quiet enough now."</p>

<p>A wondrous change they found had taken place; the crater had
disappeared. It had subsided, and an unbroken sheet of water
flowed over the site. The mud on the boulders and the turbid
condition of the water were the only signs of the late convulsion
of Nature.</p>

<p>"And so," said Brown, "the burning mountain, such as it was,
has gone for good, and we are the only men who saw it, or ever
will see it."</p>

<p>"That's so," commenced Morton, when he was interrupted by a
footstep from behind. They all turned. Scarred, bleeding, and
burnt, a most miserable object, there stood Columbus, the only
survivor of his tribe. He looked abjectly and imploringly at the
whites&mdash;apparently it was to their power he attributed the
disaster that had happened&mdash;and came forward with a crushed
and broken air, gazing woefully at the space where once the
crater had stood. Brown beckoned to him and he came readily
towards to them, and followed silently to the camping ground.
Here, after recovering their swags, they made a meal, the late
cannibal chief eating and drinking gratefully what was given to
him. With excited curiosity they set themselves to work to
decipher the contents of the old pocket book, a task that
occupied all their wits until dark.</p>

<p>"And now what's to be done?" said Morton when they had fairly
well made out the matter it contained. "It appears to me that our
work is not half finished, provided it's all true what is written
there."</p>

<p>Brown nodded. "I think there's little doubt. What do you say
to a rest, and then making back to our horses, starting from
here about midday?"</p>

<p>"Agreed on; but how about Columbus?"</p>

<p>"Well I think the poor beggar means to stick to us if we let
him, and if we can teach him to ride and speak a little, it
strikes me he'll be thundering useful. Wonder how he
escaped?"</p>

<p>"Poor Charley's asleep already, and I shan't need much
rocking. Good night; whoever wakes first call the rest;" and
Morton put his head down and was almost instantly asleep.</p>

<p>Night, dark and silent, closed in, and the tired survivors
forgot even in their dreams the tragedy they had that day
witnessed. It was with no small pleasure that they found
themselves back at the lagoon where they had left their horses.
Everything was safe, and their steeds looked first rate after
their spell; evidently they had been enjoying better times than
their riders.</p>

<p>With some trouble they got from Columbus the story of his
escape; he had rushed out after the whites, but when just outside
had been struck down by a falling rook, and knew no more,
excepting that all the others were crushed under the rocks.</p>

<p>Everything being ready for a fresh start on their errand to
follow up the discoveries recorded in the pocket-book, the
explorers bade farewell to the friendly lagoon and started in
high spirits, Brown remarking, "We found the burning mountain and
lost it again; let us hope we'll have better luck with our next
find."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 1</h3>

<p class="chaphead">The First Day&mdash;Arrival At A Native Well&mdash;<br>
Reading Stuart's Diary&mdash;The Mystery Of The Pocket-Book</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
THE course taken by the party when leaving the lagoon which
had afforded such a good refuge for their horses during their
trip to the burning mountain was to the north of that strange
formation, now the sepulchre of a tribe. Their first day's
journey took them through fairly good pastoral country,
alternating between limited areas of chocolate-soil downs and
bloodwood forests, partly grassed and partly overrun with
spinifex.</p>

<p>Towards evening a change took place, and they found themselves
amongst thickets of hedgewood, and at sundown Columbus led them
to a dry lagoon in a patch of open grassy country. In the bed of
this lagoon there was a native well, containing a very fair
supply of water. All around were many remains of old native
camps, and well defined pads radiated in all directions from the
lagoon. Evidently it was a main halting place, constantly used by
the late residents of the burning mountain when on their
periodical man-hunting expeditions.</p>

<p>Watering the horses was a somewhat tedious job, as all the
water had to be drawn from the well a billyful at a time and
poured into an extemporised trough, made out of a waterproof
sheet. This job finished, supper disposed of, and beds made down,
the usual discussion ensued on the morrow's movements.</p>

<p>"Our mutual friend Columbus, if I may now call him so," said
Brown, "seems to have his foot upon his native heath, by the way
he brought us here. When are we to reach our goal according to
his primitive mode of reckoning?"</p>

<p>"The day after to-morrow," returned Morton, "I make it, but
it's not altogether clear, for you see he doesn't understand what
sort of a day's stage horses can make yet."</p>

<p>"And what do you think of his yarn about the water and the
boats, now that we've deciphered and made a clean copy of that
never-to-be-too-much-admired pocket-book?"</p>

<p>"Well, he couldn't have invented it, for he's never seen a
boat, and as he certainly can't read he couldn't have got the
notion from the pocket-book; so I think there is something in
it."</p>

<p>"Now what do you say to making another copy of the contents of
the book and Charley and I keeping one, and you sticking to the
original? I don't anticipate any disaster, but accidents will
happen, etc."</p>

<p>"A good idea, and we'll do it to-night if Charley and Billy
will get the tent rigged."</p>

<p>The noise of the tomahawks cutting tent pegs was soon heard,
and in a short time Morton and Brown were engaged in their task
by the flickering light of one of the candles they had brought
with them, one dictating, the other writing.</p>

<p>The substance of the record that had fallen so strangely into
their hands we will now transcribe. Of the contents of the
pocket-book some parts had suffered from mutilation and some from
water; on the whole the writing, although faded, was well
preserved, and the text in spite of many omissions tolerably
coherent. It ran, as follows, commencing abruptly, there being no
clue as to how much had preceded it:&mdash;</p>

<h3>THE NARRATIVE OF THE POCKET-BOOK.</h3>

<p class="quote">
EVER since the doctor injured his hand through the musket
bursting he has been subject to attacks of feverishness and
temporary madness, and this has greatly added to the hopelessness
of our position. I have often asked him for some definite
statement of his intentions, but he seems quite unable to go into
any details, and I am afraid we are fearfully out in our
reckoning. Hentig still terribly bad with scurvy.</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>May 1, 1849</i>.&mdash;Since my last entry we have buried
Hentig, and the doctor must soon follow. If we could only get
across this dry country ahead of us we might be able to move on,
but since we are almost without rations and most of our horses
dead it seems as though we must leave our bones hero, for there
is no turning back. Doctor much worse. Kelly says that there is
only two days' more water left in the hole. No sign of rain.
Weather getting cooler.</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>May 2</i>.&mdash;This morning, before the sun got up, I
climbed the tall tree on the edge of the plain and distinctly saw
a faint smoke to the westward, in the same direction that Kelly
thought he noticed it when we first came here. To-morrow we will
start towards it; it is all we can do. How we shall get the
doctor on I cannot think; he is almost helpless, and his mind is
quite gone. We have four horses, fourteen goats; and two mules.
Be side the doctor, whom I look upon as a dead man, there are
Kelly, Murphy, and myself (Stuart). Hentig is buried under the
tree with the cross cut on it. Klusen died on the river Roper
five months ago. I will bury a copy of this in a powder-flask in
Hentig's grave.</p>

<p class="quote">(<i>Here there is an evident gap in the narration</i>.)</p>

<p class="quote">
I have been too ill to write for many days, how long I don't
know, for we have all of us lost count. I am only just beginning
to remember our journey across that horrible desert. We started
in the direction I had seen smoke after using up every drop of
water for the animals at the camp where Hentig is buried. We took
it in turns to hold the doctor on his horse, but he got very bad
a few hours after we started, and when the sun got hot he begged
us to lift him off the horse for a little while. We had all the
canteens full, and Kelly had made a bag of calico and rubbed it
outside with goat's fat, and it held water tolerably well. So we
gave the doctor plenty to drink, but he got no better, and about
noon he died. He talked a good deal to himself in German, but had
lost all knowledge of us or where he was, and a good thing too.
We could not stop to bury him, for we had to push on, so we left
him there on the big plain where I think no living thing ever
comes or ever will come since we were there. It was the second
day out when we got on to that prickly grass plain with deep red
sand, and then our horses began to give up, and we had to walk
and try and drive all the beasts, but they were so thirsty they
would not keep together, so we stopped and talked about what was
best to be done.</p>

<p class="quote">
Kelly and I agreed that it was best to unpack all the animals,
and, taking all the water and as much food as we could carry, to
march on, and perhaps if we soon came to water we could come back
for the beasts. Murphy did not think, so, he thought we could
drive them on on foot when it got dark; but we persuaded him that
we were right, and we started. We walked on long after it got
dark, and then we lay down and slept on the sandy plain amongst
the prickly grass, for since leaving the camp we have never
passed a tree. In the night Kelly called me and pointed to a
light in the west, which was evidently the reflection of a large
fire.</p>

<p class="quote">
Next morning we met it, for a wind had sprung up in the
morning. It was well for us that it was almost barren country
where we met the flames, for else we had been burnt. As it was we
were nearly stifled with heat and smoke. Afterwards, all that day
and night, we watched the glare of it behind us blazing amongst
the dry prickly grass we had passed through, carried on by the
strong wind that now blew, and we knew that our animals, saddles,
and the doctor's body would be burnt up, and no one would ever
see more of them; so it was with sorrowful hearts we walked on.
That day I saw some trees on ahead, and we turned&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote"><i>(Here the journal had been effaced,
apparently by water, but nothing of importance appeared
lost.)</i></p>

<p class="quote">
Murphy was the weakest, but we stood by him, although the
burned country was very distressing. Kelly got a little
light-headed towards morning, and I began to feel the same. I
don't remember much more; it all seems a dream of stumbling along
and helping each other, sometimes talking to the phantoms we all
fancied we saw walking with us; and then I came partly to my
senses under a rough shade of boughs, and before me was this
great lake, and I knew, by the smell of the place and almost
without looking around that I was in a camp of the natives. Kelly
and Murphy were alive, and better than I was. They remembered
something about the natives helping us to the water, for we had
passed it, and were going right away&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">(<i>Another gap</i>.)</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>June</i>.&mdash;I have put down June, for I think it must
be that time of the year, as near as I can make it. Neither Kelly
nor Murphy can read or write, so while I was ill they did not
keep the time. The natives are very friendly, and Kelly, who was
born in the bush of New South Wales, has attained great influence
over them, as he is very active, and can use nearly all their
weapons.</p>

<p class="quote">
I have been round the lake; it is nearly sixty miles round,
but very shallow, except at the end where our camp is. The
natives tell me it dries up some seasons, with the exception of
the deep hole here. They have canoes made out of shells of trees,
and can manage them very well, standing upright and poling or
sculling with a spear. They know nothing of any other blacks,
excepting a tribe to the eastward; of whom they seem greatly
frightened. They are a very simple people, and live well, as
there is plenty of fish in the lake and wild fowl.</p>

<p class="quote">
Kelly and Murphy have quite settled down to the life, but how
different it is for me! When I think of my own people and how I
am doomed to live and die amongst savages I nearly go mad; for
unless other white men find their way here I must die here; and
who would cross that horrible sand plain? If the doctor had but
lived we might have found some way of escape, but he and our
horses and saddles are all burnt up. What is the good of keeping
this record? No one will ever read it. I will become a savage
like those around me, and forget what I was.</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>July</i>.&mdash;I must write or I shall forget my language,
and that I must keep while life lasts. A strange thing happened
to-day. The old man Powlbarri came to me and made me understand
that he wanted me to go with him, he had some thing to show me. I
followed him to the ridge where the great sandstone rocks are,
and he led through a gap between two of them so narrow that we
could scarcely squeeze along.</p>

<p class="quote">
In a short time we stood in a spacious cave that penetrated
seemingly into the depths of the ridge. There was a bar of
limestone in the side and a few stalactites, but not many, and
light was admitted dimly through cracks and crevices overhead.
But when my eyes were more accustomed to the light I, started
with affright, for partly overhead and partly confronting me was
a strange gigantic shape with outstretched hand.</p>

<p class="quote">
I recoiled for an instant, and then saw how I had been
deceived; it was a rock painting on the sloping roof of the cave.
It bore no resemblance to the ordinary crude tracings of the
natives. I looked at it narrowly, and tried to get out of the old
man who did it. He gave me to understand that it had been always
there&mdash;as well as I could comprehend him, longer than the
blacks knew of. The figure was of heroic size, with straight
symmetrical features, the head surrounded by a halo or turban,
and the body attired in a rough semblance of a robe. The whole
figure was of grave aspect, and much reminded me of the drawings
I had seen of Egyptian gods.</p>

<p class="quote">
The old man beckoned to me to withdraw, and I was not sorry to
do so, for I wanted time to think, and intended to come back with
Kelly and Murphy and explore the place thoroughly. We passed out
of the cave and had just squeezed through the gap when our ears
were greeted with a shrill discordant yell of terror from the
camp. With an answering shout my companion with extraordinary
agility bounded from my side, and I ran after him.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 2</h3>

<p class="chaphead">
The End of Stuart's Journal&mdash;Once More on the
Way&mdash;The Great<br>
Sandy Spinifex Desert&mdash;The Approach to the Lake&mdash;A Ghastly Outpost.</p>
<br>

<p class="quote">THERE was little doubt what had happened; the
dreaded tribe from the east had surprised and attacked the camp.
When I arrived on the scene the fight was just assuming extensive
proportions. At first the boys, gins, and old men had been easily
overpowered, some killed and some captured; but a hunting party
came up, amongst whom were my two companions, who now went naked,
and were nearly as dark as the natives.</p>

<p class="quote">
Kelly, who would have made a brave and dashing soldier if fate
had so willed, plunged at once into the thick of the fray,
followed by Murphy, who was slower in his movements. Their
appearance disconcerted the enemy, who wore horribly
distinguished by a red smear on the forehead and a white triangle
on the breast. They rallied, however, but Kelly's onset, so
different from the ordinary method of native warfare, had
evidently staggered them.</p>

<p class="quote">
I was about to join our side when I remembered that nearly the
only part of our equipment saved was my double-barrelled pistol
and ammunition bag. This I had never used, reserving it for our
own protection, and I ran to my whirlie and come back with it
loaded. A tall blackfellow was engaged with Kelly, and rushing up
I fired at and shot him.</p>

<p class="quote">
There was an instantaneous lull of surprise, and at the
discharge of the other barrel the attackers straightway fled, and
even our own side seemed inclined to follow their example.</p>

<p class="quote">
Alas, our victory was dearly bought! Kelly was speared through
the chest, mortally I saw at once; and so it turned out, for the
poor boy died with his head on my knee in a few minutes. We
buried him that evening, and never did I feel more sorrow than
for my bright young companion, who, although uneducated, had many
noble qualities, and&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">
(<i>Here there is a large portion of the journal quite
undecipherable; the few words distinguishable seem to point to a
visit to the cave with Murphy</i>.)</p>

<p class="quote">
The strange mystery of the cave paintings still puzzles me.
The additional smaller drawings we is discovered are most
singular, and certainly point to other authorship than that of
the natives. In many places there are signs like a written
language, and the peculiar portrayal of dress indicates an
Asiatic origin. (<i>Another gap</i>.)</p>

<p class="quote">
I miss Kelly still. Murphy is dull and intractable; he has
sunk to the level of his savage companions. O God, have pity on
me, for I shall never ever see my countrymen again. Surrounded by
deserts, impassable to me on foot, I must drag out my life here,
hoping for the succour that will come too late to save me.</p>

<p class="quote">
(<i>Here the narrative breaks off, although several more blank
leaves in the pocket-book were available</i>.)</p>

<p><br>
ALTHOUGH by this time well acquainted with the contents the
re-reading of the manuscript excited fresh discussion, late as
the hour was when the task was finished.</p>

<p>"Can you make out whether Columbus in tends to take us round
by this camp where Hentig was buried?" said Brown.</p>

<p>"I think not," replied Morton, "he will probably stick to the
route he knows best; and by Stuart's narrative the cannibals did
not cross the spinifex sandy desert, but came some easier way, at
least so I infer."</p>

<p>"I expect you are right, but I should like to have gone by
Hentig's grave and verified the spot."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose we try and find out in the morning if we are
anywhere near it? Mean time, good night;" and in a few minutes
the whole camp was wrapped in profound slumber, which lasted
until daylight.</p>

<p>Columbus, on being interrogated the next morning (for he and
Billy had made up a kind of pigeon talk between them), expressed
ignorance of the place, which Morton indicated by marking a cross
on a tree in the same manner that he supposed Stuart would have
cut it.</p>

<p>It was all in vain, however; their former enemy made them
understand that there was only one way to the lake, and they had
to conclude that the sand and spinifex were of such extent as to
prevent the blacks ever crossing it. All this had occupied some
little time, but a comparatively early start was effected, and
they soon found themselves following one of the pads that ran
from the lagoon.</p>

<p>As long as they were in the hedge wood scrub they found the
track rather a nuisance, for it turned and twisted underneath
boughs too low to let the packhorses pass below, causing a
considerable amount of trouble occasionally.</p>

<p>By noon they were once more in open forest, and in an hour or
two's time they found themselves on the edge of a plain, a belt
of scrub visible in the distance. Towards this Columbus, who was
getting rather knocked up with the unaccustomed riding, directed
their course. It proved to be a fringe of gutta-percha trees on
the edge of a blue-bush flat, and a corresponding fringe on the
other side gave the flat the appearance of a broad watercourse,
which in heavy wet seasons it probably was.</p>

<p>Down this flat they proceeded until sundown, and then,
although there was no water, Morton determined to camp, evidently
much to the relief of Columbus.</p>

<p>Next morning their course still continued along the dry flat,
the gutta-percha trees now getting scantier, until at last all
was lost in one bound less extent of plain, growing sandier with
every mile they progressed, and the grass rapidly giving way to
spinifex.</p>

<p>"Morton," said Brown, "I wonder if this old fraud knows where
he is going to and whether he understands that horses can't live
without water. Things are looking pretty dry on ahead."</p>

<p>"Let's pull up and investigate," returned the other. Columbus
stuck steadily to his story and indicated that when the sun went
down they ought to get there; so the party resumed their way over
the most depressing country they had any of them ever
witnessed&mdash;loose red sand covered with spinifex all around;
strain their eyes as they would, not a break was visible on the
horizon. About three o'clock, however, some dark specks, quivered
in the haze that hung over the heated plain, the sand gradually
gave way to harder ground, grass once more reappeared and then,
suddenly as if by magic, but in reality through the travellers
topping an imperceptible rise, a blue expanse of water lay
outstretched a few miles ahead of them&mdash;the lake they were
in search of.</p>

<p>They instinctively pulled up to look at their goal.</p>

<p>Apparently it was of large dimensions, and was bordered by
coolibah trees; a slight rise, on which, by aid of the
field-glass, huge boulders could be discerned, was visible at the
end nearest the adventurers, significant of the site of the cave.
The thoughts of the three whites found vent in the one
expression, "Is he alive still?"</p>

<p>Columbus either would not or could not give them any
information; but neither Morton nor Brown entertained much
hope.</p>

<p>Murphy, a phlegmatic ignorant man, could perhaps live on to
old age, but it was unlikely that Stuart, evidently by his diary
an educated gentleman, could long endure the loneliness and
misery of his surroundings. However, all doubts would soon be
cleared up, and it was with hardly suppressed excitement that
they rode on towards the end of the lake.</p>

<p>"How about that old sinner, Columbus?" said Morton. "If he's
recognised the natives here will probably make it very sultry for
him."</p>

<p>"Yes, no doubt," replied Brown, "but he seems to have put the
whole onus of the thing on our shoulders; he's coming on quite
cheer fully. What's that on ahead?"</p>

<p>The object when approached turned out to be the bald, dried,
half-decomposed body of a blackfellow.</p>

<p>"This is some of your men's doings, my friend," said Brown,
glancing at their guide, who grinned quite innocently and
complacently.</p>

<p>The sun was near setting when they reached the edge of the
lake and watered their horses, and, this job completed, they rode
on towards what appeared to be a camp at the foot of the
sandstone ridge.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 3</h3>

<p class="chaphead">
The Camp of the Dead &mdash;A Few Survivors&mdash; Brown
Recognised As Stuart&mdash;Reception of Columbus &mdash;His
Fate&mdash;Examination of the Cave&mdash;Stuart's Grave and his
Last Manuscripts.</p>

<p class="first">NOT a sound was heard and not a living thing
was visible as they approached the group of gunyahs that formed
the native village. No smoke ascended, but from the trees around
gorged crows and kites arose at their approach and flapped
unwillingly away.</p>

<p>A pestilential smell hung heavily in the air, soon accounted
for; for around the camp lay at least a score of corpses, in the
same stage of decay as the one they had passed on the plain.</p>

<p>Mostly they were old men and women, though the smaller bodies
of children could be seen here and there. Brown drew a long
breath as he and the others gazed at this scene of slaughter.</p>

<p>"What a blessing it is," he said, "to know that all those
murdering scoundrels are crushed into jelly under a few tons of
rock."</p>

<p>"Yes!" muttered Morton. "And for two pins I could send that
hoary old sinner there to keep them company."</p>

<p>At that moment Billy Button gave a low whistle; when his
master looked towards him he indicated by a nod of his head the
direction of the ridge. A thin column of smoke was stealing up
from the back of it.</p>

<p>Whispering to Charley to take Billy and ride round the foot of
the hillock, Brown and Morton rode straight over the top and into
a camp formed by the wretched remnant who had survived the
massacre: two old men, about half a dozen gins and children, and
one young fellow badly wounded.</p>

<p>Too startled and frightened to run away they huddled together
in fear, which was considerably augmented when Charley and the
boy rode up. Brown dismounted and walked up to them. When he did
so an exclamation of surprise and pleasure broke from the old
man, and they commenced jumping up and down and shouting and
laughing uproariously.</p>

<p>Instantly it flashed across the minds of the whites that they
were mistaken for those who had formerly lived with them.</p>

<p>Morton and Charley left their horses and came up, when the
conference was abruptly interrupted by the appearance of a
riderless horse. A difference of opinion had arisen between
Columbus and his steed when the others abruptly left him, which
resulted in the discomfiture of the native, who now followed
limping after his horse.</p>

<p>Although dusk was closing in the old men recognised their
enemy at once. They stamped, raved, and spat at him, and one
picking up a spear drove at him with such vigour that only a
nimble jump saved Columbus from being transfixed. For his part he
returned their vituperation with interest, and, the gins joining
in, a perfect war of words ensued.</p>

<p>Seeing that nothing could be done till they were alone Morton
told Charley to round up the pack horses and with Billy and
Columbus go and camp on the bank of the lake where they would
join them. Once their enemy was out of sight the blacks quietened
down, and one of them commenced a voluble speech to Brown,
addressing him as "Tuartee," from which it was evident their
first surmise was correct.</p>

<p>After some trouble they made them understand that they were
going to sleep at the edge of the lake, and left them quietened
down a little.</p>

<p>"Do you think they will be there in the morning, Brown?" said
Morton as they rode away.</p>

<p>"I think so," returned the other; "curiosity will detain
them."</p>

<p>Too tired to talk much the whole camp was soon asleep, none
recking of any danger from the poor wretches they had just
left.</p>

<p>Columbus and Billy had made a separate fire a little apart,
and were sleeping coiled round in black fellow fashion.</p>

<p>Towards morning Morton felt somebody shake him; looking up he
saw Charley sitting up, who whispered to him:</p>

<p>"I'm sure there's somebody sneaking round the camp; just
listen! I was woke up some time ago by a stick breaking."</p>

<p>Sitting up Morton looked around. All appeared peaceful and
quiet. The fires had died down, and the light of the stars alone
illuminated the scene. The sheet of water alongside them was
unruffled and gave back the reflection of the thickly studded sky
over head. Not a sound, not even the cry of a night bird, could
be heard. For some minutes both men listened, when Morton said in
an undertone:</p>

<p>"Must have been fancy, Charley; there can be nobody here but
those poor brutes over the ridge."</p>

<p>"No!" said Charley; "I am sure somebody was moving about the
camp, I felt it as soon at I woke up. Listen!"</p>

<p>As he spoke load cries in chorus arose from the blacks' camp
they had visited that evening. Brown, too, started up.</p>

<p>"The devil!" he said, after listening. "That old Columbus at
his cannibal tricks again. See if he's there, Charley."</p>

<p>Billy, aroused by the outcries which rung out clear on the
silent night, was struggling to his feet.</p>

<p>"Here's Columbus," cried Charley, giving the prostrate
chieftain a good kick. "Wake up, old man!" he cried. But Columbus
never stirred.</p>

<p>"There's something up!" said Charley hesitatingly, with a
shudder. Morton struck a match, and so did Brown. It only needed
one glimpse; Columbus lay dead, his skull smashed with a
two-handed club which had been left lying there. The shouts of
the blacks were tokens of rejoicing over his death.</p>

<p>The whites gazed at the dead man in silence, and each felt
cold at the thought that the whole camp might have been as easily
despatched.</p>

<p>"Retribution!" said Morton with a sigh. "He deserved his fate,
but I can't help feeling sorry for the old rascal. Billy, my boy,
sup posing they had made a mistake and tapped you on the
cobra?"</p>

<p>Billy shook his head.</p>

<p>"This one country no good," he said; "I think it go back
alonga station."</p>

<p>"Billy, you're chock full of sense," replied Brown; "but we
shall feel better after the sun jumps up. Let's make the fire
burn and have breakfast, it's breaking day over there."</p>

<p>By the time the meal was concluded the first rays of the sun
were just visible, and whilst Charley and Billy went after the
horses Brown and his friend visited the blacks' camp.</p>

<p>The killing of Columbus was, after all, only a just act of
tribal vengeance which under like circumstances they would
probably have performed themselves; they therefore did not intend
to let it interfere with their intercourse with these natives
from whom so much might probably be learnt.</p>

<p>They were greeted with cries of "Tuartee!" and no sign of fear
was evinced by any of them. Brown endeavoured to make one of the
old men understand that he wanted to be shown the cave, but
evidently the old fellow, if he did comprehend him, thought his
guidance was quite superfluous to a returned spirit who ought to
know all about it.</p>

<p>He imitated all Brown's gestures, and pointed politely in the
same direction he did, but that was all they could get out of
him. The stock of patience on both sides was running low when
Charley and Billy came up riding two of the horses bare backed,
and the question of the moment was dropped in order to determine
their next movements.</p>

<p>It was evident that some days would have to be spent in the
neighbourhood in order to thoroughly investigate the fate of
Stuart, so, to avoid the neighbourhood of the dead bodies, they
determined to camp in a clump of timber some distance away from
the foot of the ridge.</p>

<p>Charley and Billy therefore went back to the lake to shift
camp, and Brown and Morton started on an independent search of
their own. They had no hope of finding Stuart alive; the
recognition by the blacks proved that he must have been dead for
years.</p>

<p>They were fortunate at once. Naturally they selected the two
most imposing looking boulders which seemed to answer best to the
description in the journal, and on nearer approach a well-worn
pad indicated that they were on the right track. Squeezing
through the narrow aperture described by Stuart they found
themselves in the cavern confronting the strange form painted on
the roof and side. Prepared as they were for the startling
appearance of the figure, they could not refrain from feeling a
certain awe as they gazed at it, and recognised at once that it
was never the work of the Australian aborigines. A movement
behind made Morton turn hastily.</p>

<p>One of the old men had silently followed them and was standing
a pace or two away. Seeing Brown look curiously around after the
first survey of the figure he advanced and, beckoning to him, led
him to the side of the cavern to a place whereon the light fell
strongly from above.</p>

<p>There in the rock neatly cut out with care was a name,
"Charles Neil Stuart"; underneath&mdash;"Came Here 1849.
Died"&mdash;then followed a date cut, or rather scratched with a
feeble hand, and which they made out to be 1864.</p>

<p>With uncovered heads the two white men gazed sorrowfully and
reverently at the resting place of their unfortunate countryman,
for both intuitively felt that here was his grave.</p>

<p>The native advanced, and putting his hand into a crevice in
the rock drew out a package done up in the skins of some small
marsupials and further protected by a casing of bark; this he
gravely handed to Brown, who received it, but refrained from
opening it at once.</p>

<p>After a short scrutiny around they left the cave, and on a
convenient rock sat down and inspected the precious parcel. It
contained an old-fashioned double barrelled pistol much rusted, a
powder flask, a bullet-mould greatly dinted and battered, and a
roll of loose leaves of paper on which there was much faded
writing. Together the two friends pored over the leaves which
told the sad concluding portion of the castaway's life.</p>

<p>Thus ran his story:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">
I AM now alone, and I know not whether my comrade is living or
dead. It was a year after Kelly's death&mdash;by my reckoning,
which I have kept by notches on a rock in the cave&mdash;that I
went with three natives to a scrub about ten miles from here to
get a peculiar kind of wood I was looking for to make bows of.
For now that I had made up my mind I would never be rescued I
thought I would try to teach the natives the use of the bow and
arrow, and we would lead them against this tribe whom they
dreaded so and who killed Kelly, and perhaps obtain peace.</p>

<p class="quote">
There was no wood suitable near the camp, but from the
description given by the blacks I thought I could obtain what I
wanted in the scrub indicated by the blacks. There was water
there, and we stopped two days, cutting and dressing the sap
lings so as to make them lighter to carry in, for as we only had
stone tomahawks it took a long time.</p>

<p class="quote">
On the evening of the second day we heard a girl wailing and
crying in the distance, coming towards us. The blacks stopped
their work and ran to meet her, crying out in the same tone. I
knew something was wrong and followed them. It was sad news,
awful news.</p>

<p class="quote">
The Warlattas, as the hostile tribe was called, had attacked
the camp at night, had killed and wounded many, and carried off a
number of prisoners&mdash;amongst them Murphy, who was a heavy
sleeper and had no chance to defend himself. I knew that these
Warlattas were cannibals, and that the prisoners they took away
were probably eaten.</p>

<p class="quote">
We got back to camp in the middle of the night, and the next
morning I tried to get the men who were left to follow me after
the cannibals, but they were all so cowed they wouldn't, although
I showed them the pistol and fired it off. I tried to track the
enemy by myself, and if I could I would have followed them, but I
lost the tracks and nearly died of thirst.</p>

<p class="quote">
The Warlattas had taken nearly all the few things we had
saved, including my pocket-book; these few sheets I am writing on
were picked up about the camp.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 4</h3>

<p class="chaphead">Continuation of Stuart's Narrative&mdash;The
Slaughter Chamber&mdash;Billy Button's Discovery&mdash;A Sail on
the Lake</p>
<br>

<p class="quote">
<i>1853</i>.&mdash;That is my reckoning. All this time I have
written nothing, as I wanted to husband my paper and I had little
heart after Murphy was taken away. I made the blacks build a
place with stones&mdash;a sort of barricade to sleep in at
night&mdash;and it was lucky I did, for the Warlattas came again;
but, thanks to the barricade and my pistol, we beat them off
without losing a man, and now the natives have great confidence,
and I think will beat them again.</p>

<p class="quote">
I often tried to get them to follow me to where these people
lived, as I thought Murphy might be alive and I could rescue him,
but they seemed to be horribly frightened at the thought and
refused always. On examining the bodies of those that had fallen
I found them all marked the some way with some sort of pigment, a
red smear on the forehead and a white triangle on the breast.
This and something in their appearance led me to think if there
was not some connection between the figures in the cave and this
strange people.</p>

<p class="quote">
Thinking long over this, I explored the cave thoroughly, both
it and any in the neighbourhood, and finally it led me to the
strange discovery that has caused me to write my journal once
more, in the faint hope that some day it will be found and read
by civilised man. Searching around the cave containing the
painted figure I found an aperture which apparently ran for some
distance. It was on the ground, the rock coming to within about
two feet of the sandy floor, and on stooping down it seemed to me
that I could feel a current of fresh air passing through.</p>

<p class="quote">
On inquiry I found that none of the blacks had been into the
opening, as they had a superstitious dislike&mdash;scarcely,
however, amounting to dread&mdash;of the cave. The aperture was
too low to easily admit me, so I got a slim young fellow to
explore it. He soon crawled back, saying there was another big
cave beyond, but too dark to see anything.</p>

<p class="quote">
I got some more boys up and set them to scoop the sand away
until the opening was big enough for me to pass in. We took fire
and bark and wood with us, and when we emerged in the gloomy
cavern beyond we immediately kindled a fire.</p>

<p class="quote">
As the blaze arose and illuminated the recesses of the cave a
shriek of terror burst from my juvenile companions, a wild try of
"Warlatta! Warlatta!" and in an instant they disappeared like a
bevy of black rats underneath the rock where we had entered.</p>

<p class="quote">
I looked around in surprise, but soon divined the cause; on
the opposite side appeared, drawn in white on the wall, a large
triangle, the sign ever associated in their minds with murder and
rapine. Heaping more wood on the fire, I advanced and examined
the surroundings.</p>

<p class="quote">
Underneath the triangle was a huge block of yellowish-white
sandstone, but its purity was marred by a horrible reddish stain
which marked one of its sloping sides. Its purpose flashed on me
at once&mdash;in some old time it had been used as a sacrificial
stone.</p>

<p class="quote">
The fire now blazed up merrily, and I had ample light for my
researches. The smoke disappeared through crevices in the roof,
and the ventilation seemed excellent. Marks of old fires were
visible all over the floor, which was of white sandstone with the
same reddish stains visible in places. Searching more minutely I
found in one corner a knife or dagger, made of steel (since then
I have found it to be tempered so hard that the edge can scarcely
be turned by the hardest rock). The handle, if it ever had one,
had disappeared through age. In addition, there was a broken ring
of the same metal, seemingly part of a chain, and on the walls
were characters in red, but of no written language that I could
remember.</p>

<p class="quote">
This was all that I saw on my first visit. Voices at the
opening told me that the natives had recovered from their fright,
and were in search of me. I called to them, and emboldened by my
voice and the firelight some of them crept in and joined me.</p>

<p class="quote">
I found out that they had no knowledge of this chamber, and in
hopes of finding another I set them hunting round for any more
openings that might exist, but none could be discovered. Whilst
so engaged one of them brushed against the stone altar, and
immediately it commenced rocking, whilst a squeaking piercing
scream, like a human being in intense agony, thrilled us all with
horror.</p>

<p class="quote">
The blacks threw themselves on the ground, and it was a few
moments before I could summon up courage to approach the stone
and examine it. The rocking was gradually ceasing, and the
shrieks grew fainter as the motion ceased. The stone I found to
be most beautifully poised, so that the slightest touch started
the oscillation. As to the machinery that produced the screaming
noise, that I could not investigate without capsizing the stone,
which evidently weighed some tons.</p>

<p class="quote">
For a moment I shut my eyes, and seemed to see once more the
hideous drama that must have been many times enacted in this
chamber of death&mdash;the savage priests, the manacled victim,
the streaming flood, the trembling captives, and the harsh
shrieking of the rocking stone adding its awful voice to the
groans of the dying man and fading away into silence with his
last cries.</p>

<p class="quote">
What horrible ingenuity had devised such added terrors to the
scene? By degrees I got the blacks out of their fright, but it
was amusing to see the celerity with which they disappeared as
soon as I gave the signal. I have made no further discoveries,
and all the time I have spent over trying to decipher
inscriptions has been vain. I can only conjecture that these
relics are of great antiquity, and that the belief and some of
the rites, notably cannibalism, survive amongst the Warlattas,
who are mixed and degenerate descendants of the ancient race.</p>

<p class="quote">
I have but little paper left, and that scrap I must keep for
any necessity that arises. If anybody find this let him take a
copy of the inscriptions, for some men may be able to decipher
them.</p>
<br>

<p class="quote">
<i>1861</i>. &mdash;I have given up all hopes, and have
devoted my time to improving the condition of those natives, who
are gentle and tractable. We have twice defeated the Warlattas
with great loss, and now they never come. I have taught them to
build better huts, to use bows and arrows, and to cultivate yams,
and to be more cleanly in their habits. Some of the younger ones
understand written characters, and most of them now go partly
dressed.</p>

<p class="quote">
I might have done much more, but rheumatism has crippled me of
late. I have explained to the natives to bury me in the cave
underneath an inscription I have cut&mdash;my name and the date
of my arrival here.</p>

<p class="quote">
One thing I could not with all my influence accomplish, and
that was to persuade the natives, or a portion of them, to set
out with me and travel to the eastward. All my promises were of
no avail; a superstitious feeling that I cannot overcome binds
them to this lake.</p>

<p class="quote">
When I feel myself dying, unless I fall by accident, I will
try and inscribe the last date on the stone; it will stand for my
death. If my companions had lived we might have worked our way
back, but alone it was hopeless to attempt it. I know my end must
be near, and I thank God that though I have lived so long amongst
these savages I have not sunk down to be one of them in my
habits, but rather have taught them better things.</p>

<p class="quote">
To whoever of my countrymen finds this I leave the greeting
and blessing I would have given him in life.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
"POOR fellow!" sighed Brown after a short silence; "I wish to
goodness we could have come here thirty years ago, his life would
have been worth saving."</p>

<p>"Fate, old man," returned the other. "Let us go to the camp; I
expect Charley is anxious to hear the news."</p>

<p>The morning was spent in arranging their camp, and in the
afternoon they returned with some presents for the natives on the
ridge. The old men went round with them, and showed them the
roofless stone huts, the dismantled barricade, and the remains of
other improvements all now in ruins. The death of Stuart seemed
to have been the signal for a return to their old habits, his
life amongst them not having been long enough to make a permanent
impression.</p>

<p>Even the bows and arrows had disappeared, and it was evident
that the Warlattas had resumed warlike operations with a success
resulting in the almost complete extermination of the tribe.</p>

<p>Morton tried to explain that their enemies were dead, but it
was doubtful whether the old men comprehended him or not. An
immediate incursion into the inner cave was determined on, and,
provided with candles, the party and the two men soon found
themselves at the opening.</p>

<p>The sand had worked in and somewhat blocked up the space, but
this was soon removed enough to enable them to wriggle like
snakes underneath the rock. Half a dozen candles served to
brilliantly light up the inner chamber, and there untouched shone
out the white triangle over the sacrificial stone. Brown started
the stone rocking, and immediately the shrill half human screams
echoed through the cavern, much to Billy's discomfiture. No
examination could detect the trick that caused the sound, nor
could the presence of the stone be explained unless as a most
singular freak of nature.</p>

<p>"I have it," said Morton at last; "the stone was part of the
rock, and they cut it away underneath; it must have been an awful
job, but that's how it was done."</p>

<p>"And about the squeaking machinery?"</p>

<p>"That's more than we can find out without shifting the stone,
and that's a job I'm not on for unless we intend to stop here a
month or two and chip it to pieces."</p>

<p>"A charge of dynamite would do the trick, and next time I come
exploring I'll bring one," returned Brown.</p>

<p>"What do you think the thing was put there for?" asked
Charley.</p>

<p>"Well, I've just had an inspiration," said Brown. "You know
amongst many savage nations it is a matter of religious belief
almost to make your enemy howl when you have got him down. Now,
perhaps, some of these poor devils who were cut up on this stone
declined to sing out, or fainted, or did not somehow give
amusement enough, so the stone was set rocking to atone for
deficiencies and fill out the programme. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"I think it is most likely, and is a piece of devilish
cruelty, just of a piece with their other doings."</p>

<p>"I suppose poor Stuart searched the place so thoroughly that
we need not expect to find any thing fresh," said Charley, "but
let's have a look anyhow. Come, Billy, you've got sharp
eyes."</p>

<p>Whilst these two were investigating the walls and floor,
Morton and Brown took a careful copy of the hieroglyphics and a
sketch of the cave and position of the sacrificial stone and
triangle.</p>

<p>By the time they had finished evening was coming on, and they
returned to camp to discuss the novel incidents of the day.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt," said Morton, "that what we have seen are
relics of an ancient people; but what I can't understand is, why,
if they were so civilised as to wear dresses, and to have a
developed religious belief, savage as it was&mdash;('No worse
than the Carthaginians,' remarked Brown)&mdash;to know how to
obtain iron and temper it, they did not build permanent dwellings
the ruins of which would remain."</p>

<p>"Mud, my dear fellow, mud," replied Brown. "Remember the
nations who have disappeared off the face of the continent of
America, and can only be traced by their pottery and their burial
mounds. Why the gorgeous cities of ancient Mexico were built of
mud bricks, which go back to their original mother earth once the
domiciles they form are abandoned."</p>

<p>"But their smelting works for manufacturing iron?"</p>

<p>"There you have me; but we must try and find that knife;
perhaps they buried it with Stuart."</p>

<p>"Billy got something from one of the old men, but I don't know
what it was," said Charley.</p>

<p>"Billy, what old man been give it?" asked Morton. Billy
grinned, and produced from inside the bosom of his shirt the
knife mentioned in the diary.</p>

<p>It was a curious looking weapon, about a foot long, broad, and
slightly curved. Even after the work Stuart had done with it
carving out the inscription it seemed as sharp as an ordinary
knife.</p>

<p>"That's a Malay weapon," said Brown after a pause; "wherever
our ancient Australians came from it was from the north. Well, I
suppose we must wait until we get the writing deciphered, if ever
we find a man clever enough to do it."</p>

<p>Looking closer they found that the blade had the fatal
triangle engraved on it. This constantly recurring symbol led to
much speculation as to whether they were not an early off shoot
of Freemasons, who, after the completion of the temple, had
wandered into Central Australia, but as Charley ingenuously
reminded them that these fellows had not built anything the
theory had to be discarded.</p>

<p>Next morning Billy, by aid of one of the old natives, found an
old canoe not far below the surface, and brought it up and bailed
it out. It then was explained by the old man that the Warlattas
on their last incursion had sunk all the canoes.</p>

<p>The one recovered was a large one and fitted up with
outriggers, and leaked but very little. Charley soon improvised a
mast by lashing two spears together, and with a blanket for a
sail announced himself ready for a voyage. Morton determined to
accompany him in a voyage of discovery round the lake, Brown
preferring to continue the investigation of the cave
drawings.</p>

<p>There was a fair breeze, and in half an hour's time the canoe
was nearly out of sight. Meanwhile Brown wandered over the ridge,
telling Billy to try and talk to the blacks and inform them all
about the tragedy at the burning mountain.</p>

<p>Several lesser caves attracted his attention, but only one
seemed to promise any result. To this one he devoted himself, and
after some trouble discovered as inscription resembling the
former ones in character, but differing in the arrangement of the
letters. In this case they were placed perpendicularly in two
parallel rows.</p>

<p>After copying the inscription, Brown stood in thought for some
time, mechanically thrusting a yam stick he held in his hand into
the sandy floor of the cave.</p>

<p>Apparently the soil over the bed rock was but a few inches in
depth, but suddenly he was aroused from his reverie by the yam
stick going down more than a foot without meeting with any
opposition. Sounding hastily he soon made out that a trench
extended at right angles to the rock immediately under the
inscription.</p>

<p>Running outside he coo-eed loudly, and Billy and the blacks
came running up. He set them to work to clear all the sand away
with their hands from the neighbourhood of the trench, and it was
soon visible, evidently artificially out in the rock.</p>

<p>It was about three feet long and a foot broad, so the work of
cleaning it out did not promise to take long. With so many hands
at work the depth of three feet was soon reached without
anything being discovered; then the fingers of the worker struck
a hard substance, and very soon a sheet of copper was disclosed,
cut the size of the hole.</p>

<p>Greatly excited in spite of his usual assumption of calmness,
Brown inserted the point of the yam stick under the metal and
prized it up.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 5</h3>

<p class="first">
THE shadow cast by the sides of the hole was too deep for
Brown to see at once what sort of treasure he had unearthed, but
a nearer inspection did not afford him any more satisfaction.
Apparently there was nothing beneath the sheet of copper but a
deposit of damp mouldy earth, emitting a pungent smell of a most
repulsive nature.</p>

<p>Brown drew back somewhat sickened, and told the natives to
clean out the trench while he went outside for a breath of fresh
air. In a few minutes he returned. The heap of mould alongside
the now empty hole told him that the work was done.</p>

<p>The blacks were on their knees eagerly examining some small
objects they had found amongst the contents of the trench.</p>

<p>Billy handed them to Brown. The first was a chain of small
steel links, of most beautiful workman ship, bearing as a pendant
a tiny triangle formed of the same substance. A metal plate some
few inches in diameter covered with hieroglyphics similar to
those inscribed on the walls of the cave was the next he
examined, and then came a dagger resembling the one already
discovered. This, however, had a handle, or what appeared to be
one, made of finely twisted gold threads wound tightly round the
haft. This was all.</p>

<p>Puzzled exceedingly, Brown put the relics on one side and
strolled to the crest of the ridge to look across the lake and
see how the voyagers were getting on.</p>

<p>Apparently they had experienced what is known as a soldier's
wind, for the canoe was coming swiftly back with a flowing sail.
Brown and Billy walked down to the bank to meet them. The trip
had been uninteresting; the lake was but a shallow clay-pan only
some six or seven feet deep at the outside, with the exception of
the end near the camp, where there was a hole nearly eighty feet
deep. Brown told them of the discovery he had made, and they
revisited the cave together.</p>

<p>"It's my opinion," said Morton after a lengthened examination,
"that it is a grave; this mould is all that there is left of a
body&mdash;probably burnt before being put in the grave. The
necklet plate and dagger are the ornaments and weapons worn by
the corpse at the time of burial. He must have been some great
priest."</p>

<p>"The conclusion I have been working round to," replied Brown;
"the plate is a breast plate like those we read of in the Old
Testament."</p>

<p>For three days the trio continued their explorations and
researches, but nothing further was found, and the question of
their return became the important one of the hour.</p>

<p>Brown had a great desire to return by Hentig's grave, which
was not shared by Morton, who contended that there was a great
chance that the water at the native well would be dried up, and
if so it would be as much as they could do to reach the lagoon
with all their horses, without going on a wild-goose chase for a
place the direction of which they did not even know.</p>

<p>Brown allowed himself to be persuaded, but it was evident that
his heart was set on following back, step by step, the path of
the long-lost exploring expedition.</p>

<p>For the first time since they started there was an atmosphere
of contention in the camp which made them all unanimous in one
thing, that it was time to return, and on that resolution they
slept.</p>

<p>The sun was high the next morning, and much to the surprise of
the others Charley slept on with the blanket drawn over his head
until at last Morton roused him. The boy sat up and, looking
vacantly round, recovered himself after a bit, and proceeded to
get up. He refused anything to eat, and contented himself with
drinking more than his allowance of tea. Morton watched him
uneasily.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, old man?" he said at last.</p>

<p>"I don't feel up to the mark," replied Charley. "I had a
wretched dream last night; it kept me awake afterwards until
nearly day light."</p>

<p>"I feel off colour, too," said Brown. "Last night I could have
quarrelled with my shadow. I hope we didn't release any evil
spirit from that grave."</p>

<p>"Don't say that," returned Charley, "for that is just what I
dreamt of. Strange you should think the same."</p>

<p>"Tell us what it was, sonny," said Morton; "we'll soon fix up
any intrusive old ghost."</p>

<p>Charley, as the others could see, had been up set by
something, and Morton felt uneasy when he reflected how far away
from help they were in case of sickness.</p>

<p>"I dreamt," commenced Charley, "I was on the edge of the
lake. I was alone and horribly frightened. I thought you both had
gone away and left me here. I tried to cry out but could not, and
turned round, for I felt some fearful thing was approaching me
from behind. True enough the great figure from the cave was there
looking at me with terrible eyes. On his breast was the plate we
found in the grave, and I could read the characters written on
it."</p>

<p>Charley paused.</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Brown, interested by the boy's
earnestness.</p>

<p>"I can shut my eyes and see it now. It ran: 'The spirit of
evil is everywhere. Worship, then, the spirit of evil and do his
behests.' As I looked and read, the form smiled mockingly at me,
and I woke up in cold perspiration, and could not sleep
again."</p>

<p>"Charley, my boy," said Morton, "we will discuss your dream
by-and-by; meantime, I am going to mix you some quinine and snake
bite antidote&mdash;otherwise brandy&mdash;and we'll make a start
for home at once, I think."</p>

<p>"Do you know?" said Brown to Morton as they were packing up
the horses, "I don't feel at all right either. I feel as though I
had been told that these awful rites of old will claim another
victim before we're out of their influence."</p>

<p>"Here, don't you talk like that before Charley, he's sickening
with malarial fever, and we must get him home at once," replied
Morton. "So no more superstition, old man, but work like a
nigger."</p>

<p>"Talking of niggers, what about these beggars here?"</p>

<p>"Why, I suppose they will die out in time. We will leave them
all we can spare; game is plentiful, and the Warlattas are all
dead. We can do no more, but they are bound for the great
majority in a year or two."</p>

<p>By ten o'clock the horses were packed and ready. The poor
remnant of the tribe that had sheltered the survivors of
Leichhardt's expedition watched them depart with the stolid
apathy of their race, and in a few hours the timber of the lake
was lost to view, and the travellers were on the spacious plain
of the desert.</p>

<p>Charley was feverish and almost light-headed, and Morton was
rendered irritable by anxiety to get on and a doubt whether there
was any water left, in the native well. Their horses were fresh,
and he determined to trust to his bushmanship and travel all
night if Charley could stand it.</p>

<p>Brown was in a more than usually apathetic mood, and even
Billy seemed to share the gloom that had seized upon the party.
All through the dark moonless night they rode until, about 8
o'clock, Charley begged for a rest, and they dismounted and
unpacked the horses, but tied them up, meaning to start again in
an hour or two.</p>

<p>The short sleep refreshed the sick lad, and as day broke they
were again on the way, and by noon were at the native well.
Morton gave a sigh of relief; the water had not sunk an inch
since their visit. Tenderly he helped his young relation to the
shade of one of the old native gunyahs, and made up a bed for
him.</p>

<p>That night poor Charley was in a raging delirium. Day after
day of weary monotony passed. Both men watched unremittingly by
the side of the invalid. To move on was impossible. They could
only wait, and, if it so turned out, help the poor boy in to the
station, or bury his body in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Rations were eked out with game, and fortunately the well, fed
by some small spring, remained the same, and so in constant
anxiety passed the time.</p>

<p>On the sixth day the patient was terribly restless and
feverish, his mind wandered continually, and he always raved
about the giant figure in the cave, standing at his side,
threatening him.</p>

<p>Brown, who had been watching by him, arose and asked Morton to
take his place; then he retired to their tent and soon afterwards
went away into the bush. In about half an hour he returned.</p>

<p>"How's Charley?" he said.</p>

<p>"Been asleep for the last ten minutes, and I think he's going
to got better," replied Morton. Brown said, "Umph!" with a very
gratified expression, and retired to his couch. In the morning
Charley was unmistakably better, and from that time commenced to
steadily improve.</p>

<p>Rations were now running short, for they had been very liberal
in what they gave the blacks, and it was necessary to make a
fresh start as soon as there was the slightest chance of doing
so.</p>

<p>It was after much toil that they once more arrived at the
lagoon whence they had left for the burning mountain. The long
day through the hedgewood scrub had been very trying on the still
weak invalid, and another short rest was imperative.</p>

<p>"Brown," said Morton during the day as they were lying
listlessly smoking, "let's have another look at that plate with
the figures on it. Where did you put it."</p>

<p>"Well, to tell you the truth, old man, it's gone. I returned
it to mother earth."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, I'm certain there was something uncanny about that
thing. I never told you, but I got that same dream Charley had
over and over again, and could always see that plate with the
words on it: 'The spirit of evil is every where. Worship, then,
the spirit of evil.' If we'd kept that I believe not one of us
would have got back, so I took it away and buried it, and that
night Charley got better at once. Now what's the verdict?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was going to call you a thundering superstitious old
fool, but in view of the facts I won't. It must have been a tribe
of devil worshippers who free selected that cave originally."</p>

<p>"That's a weight off my mind. I thought you'd turn rusty when
you found what I had done, for there's no doubt that relic was
precious, and something might have been made out of it, but we
have got the copies of the inscriptions in the same character for
the learned to wrangle over."</p>

<p>The distance separating them from the burial place was easily
covered by means of the well cleared track they had accidentally
stumbled on, and they rode along recalling the incidents of the
midnight procession, and all they had discovered since, until
they arrived at the open country round the first waterhole.</p>

<p>"I think I'll bring some cattle out here some day, and take
this bit of downs up," remarked Morton.</p>

<p>"You'll have quiet neighbours at any rate," replied his
companion, indicating the scrub full of the burial scaffolds.</p>

<p>"They won't do any duffing, that's certain," said Charley, who
was now getting stronger fast.</p>

<p>All felt rejoiced when on the morning of the fourth day the
plain, homely, but welcome buildings that formed the station came
in sight. Of the speculation and wonder that followed the recital
of their adventures nothing need be said.</p>

<p>Billy Button was regarded by the other blacks as having wiped
out the Warlattas single handed, a belief which he diligently
fosters.</p>

<p>Copies of the writing on the cave walls have been sent to
Europe, but as yet they have not been deciphered. Meanwhile, it
is rumoured that the Governments of the different colonies intend
to bring in the remains of Stuart and Hentig and accord them a
public funeral.</p>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>13. -- JIM'S LATEST EXPERIENCE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 21 May 1898</h3>

<p class="first">
SINCE Jim Parks wrote to me about his experiences with the
spiders, whom he succeeded in finally banishing, I had not heard
from him until the other day, when he wrote and told me that he
had an entirely new experience to relate to me, if I could find
time to run up and see him.</p>

<p>As Jim is always good company, I gladly accepted the
invitation, and was cordially welcomed by him and his wife.</p>

<p><br>
THIS last experience of mine, (<i>said he, when yarning time
came</i>) regularly floored me for a while. I was going to write
to you at the time, just to hunt up some more of those old books
about witches and such like; but I didn't like to confess myself
beat, and went a lone hand, and pulled through. I read all that
Mr. Stead had to say on the subject in his books about real ghost
stories, and the Borderland, and so en, and found not a word
there bearing on my troubles. Look here! if Stead had only
applied to me, I would have pitched him a far better lot of yarns
than he has published, wouldn't I now?</p>

<p>'I'm sure of it, Jim.'</p>

<p>I was haunted for a long time before I could exactly locate
what was wrong, and then I suddenly found out that there was a
conspiracy against me, a conspiracy of ghosts.</p>

<p>You see, they'd got narked at my poking fun at them, and
telling everybody that the best way to floor a ghost was to make
game of it, so they determined to give me a lesson. And they did,
too, for a time. I'll say that for them though, that they never
troubled the wife. She's not used to the ways of ghosts like I
am. Fortunately, she went away on a visit to her eldest married
sister, who had just had twins, so I was able to tackle the
ghosts alone.</p>

<p>The trouble commenced with a Scotchman, a Highlander, who
pretended that he could only talk Gaelic, and consequently could
not answer when he was spoken to. I got rid of him quickly by
treating him as though I did not see him&mdash;walking through
him, and generally ignoring him. He was a foolish sort of ghost
to send to frighten me, and I wonder, by what occurred
afterwards, that they were so green as to do it.</p>

<p>The real trouble commenced the day after the Scotchman
disappeared. I had been out at work since daylight, and had come
in to breakfast, when one of the men who were fencing came
running in to tell me that Dick Trumbles, my neighbor, had just
cut his throat&mdash;would I come over, and do what I could?</p>

<p>Dick was a good fellow, but had been rather down-hearted
lately on account of a girl having chucked him over. The man said
that a messenger had run over to tell him, and hurried back
again; so I put on my hat, and went at once. The first man I saw
was Trumbles, harnessing one of his horses.</p>

<p>Like an idiot I did not drop to the trick at once, and blurted
out, 'Why, Dick, they just sent over for me, because you'd cut
your throat?'</p>

<p>Dick looked at me, and seeing that I was pretty flustered with
running, he said, 'Uh! Jim; got 'em again; bad this time,
too.'</p>

<p>I got mad, and asked him what he meant by rousing a hungry man
from his breakfast with his stale old jokes. So we had some hot
words about it, and presently he walked over with me, and
interviewed the fencers. They said that certainly a man had come
running up to them with the message. I guessed the truth at once,
and made it right with Dick, and went in to my breakfast again.
As I sat down I heard a <i>he</i>! <i>he</i>! kind of laugh from
somewhere.</p>

<p>I confess I didn't like it, for I could see no end of worry
sticking out, and for a while they certainly did give me fits.
One time the police and a whole lot of men armed to the teeth
came rushing up, and I was nearly shot down like a dingo because
a man had come up and reported that Jim Parks had gone raving
mad, and was murdering all hands on his selection.</p>

<p>It undoubtedly was mean, the way they went about it, for they
would not appear to me so that I could get a chance at them, but
always to somebody else; and they did it so well, too, that
nobody would believe it was ghosts doing it all the while. I
began to get into bad odor. People said I was a confounded
nuisance, and suggested that I should give some other locality a
turn.</p>

<p>Just then I was thinking of writing to you to send me some
more books up, when I hit upon an idea which, made me prefer to
tackle it myself. I wrote to the wife and told her not to hurry
back; then I laid myself out to worry the ghosts in return.</p>

<p>Of course, it looked a pretty hard contract, for I had to
catch, one first, and while they could always locate me, I could
not locate them. However, I waited and watched, and at last
succeeded in getting speech with one. As ghosts are always fond
of a yarn with human beings, he was ready to talk after a few
words.</p>

<p>I asked him what they meant by plaguing me, to which he
answered that I knew, too much about ghosts, and was bringing
them rapidly into contempt. Very soon nobody would care a snap
about ghosts, and where would their business be then? Was it fair
on my part to take, so to speak, the bread out of their
mouths?</p>

<p>Having once got him into an argument, I was safe.</p>

<p>'Now look at the matter plainly, from a common-sense point of
view,' I said. 'Did a ghost ever do any good to anybody? What's
the sense in acting the giddy scarecrow and frightening women and
children. You can't frighten me, and you know it, and I'll find a
man besides that the whole boiling of you wouldn't frighten.'</p>

<p>The ghost laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>'Why, I could, and a ghost who can materialise himself into
shapes that would make you die screaming with fright.'</p>

<p>'Bring him along,' I said. 'If he frightens me or my friend
I'll give in, and have no truck with ghosts any more. If we're
not scared, you just clear' out, and leave me alone for the
future.'</p>

<p>'I can't decide myself,' he replied. 'You see, there's been a
committee of ghosts appointed in, this matter. We're going to
bust Jim Parks&mdash;that's you. It's called the Jim Parks
Abolishment Society. It's a strong branch of the Society for the
Suppression of Sceptics. I'll lay the matter before the
committee, and faring you their report.'</p>

<p>The ghost, who was a highly respectable old gentleman to look
at, was about disappearing, when I stopped him.</p>

<p>'Can't you fellows materialise yourselves solid,' I asked, 'so
that you could catch hold of anything?'</p>

<p>'Some in the higher planes can. This ghost of whom I am
speaking can do so.'</p>

<p>'All right, it's an offer, pay or play.'</p>

<p>The ghost departed, and I sent into the township for a young
fellow I knew well. He was a doctor looking out for a place to
start a practice; but just then doing nothing. He was death on
ghosts and all that kind of work, understood hypnotism, and had
studied the phenomena of spiritual manifestations, as lie called
it. He came out at once, and was delighted at the show I promised
him. We were sitting at dinner when I heard a voice in the
verandah call out, 'Jim Parks!'</p>

<p>'That's the ghost,' I said. Then sung out, 'Come in; there's
no one here but my friend.'</p>

<p>The ghost stepped inside. Then a strange thing happened. The
doctor got up all white and shaky, staring at the figure as
though he had turned loony all of a sudden. Here's a breakdown, I
thought. If he's frightened of a quiet, gentlemanly ghost like
this, what will happen when he sees the one promised us. But I
was wrong; it was not funk, only astonishment.</p>

<p>'Why, dad,' he said, and then I knew that it was the ghost of
his father who stood there.</p>

<p>'Well, Robert, my boy,' replied the spectre. 'How are you; and
how are you and Lucy getting along?'</p>

<p>'Lucy and I are not married, and I'm looking round to build
up a practice somewhere.'</p>

<p>'Good gracious!' said the ghost. 'Why aren't you married, and
why did you not keep my practice on?'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Robert; 'the practice was sold to pay off that
old debt to Solomons&mdash;'</p>

<p>'To do what!' interrupted the old ghost. 'Why, Solomons was
paid off before I died, and I made sure that you would have got
along comfortably with my practice&mdash;it wanted a younger man;
and you would have married Lucy and settled down.'</p>

<p>'We could find no receipt, and Solomons swore that the debt
was not settled, and he could not wait any longer for his
money.'</p>

<p>'The scoundrel!' said the ghost, now in a towering rage. 'The
swindler, robber, thief! I'll give Solomons a turn! Fifty per
cent I've paid him. Not find the receipt; why, I put the receipt
in, in&mdash;now, where did I put that receipt?'</p>

<p>We waited in silence, but the ghost was evidently astray.</p>

<p>'Did you get my prescription for "Bunce's Miraculous Moist
Powders?"' he asked.</p>

<p>'No; I looked for that everywhere.'</p>

<p>'Very strange, very strange! Won't I give that Solomons
fits!'</p>

<p>Somehow, I felt sorry for Solomons. Old Dr. Bunce, or his
shade, puzzled his brains in vain. At last his son said, 'I have
an idea. Would you mind allowing me to hypnotise you?'</p>

<p>'On no account,' said the old gentleman, testily. 'You know my
rooted objection to all that humbug.'</p>

<p>'But this is a matter of the greatest importance. Perhaps it
will set me up on my legs, and enable me to marry Lucy. Do let me
try.'</p>

<p>The old man was moved.</p>

<p>'You can't hypnotise a ghost,' he protested.</p>

<p>'Let me try, at any rate.'</p>

<p>To cut it short, he consented, and Robert went to work. He
started the old ghost looking steadfastly at a saucer full of
tea, and begged him to concentrate his thoughts on the missing
receipt. We waited in perfect silence. Presently Robert made some
passes, and told his father to look up.</p>

<p>The ghost raised his face. His eyes were open, but set
fixedly. Evidently he saw nothing.</p>

<p>'When Solomons gave you the receipt for the money where did
you go?' asked Robert.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>'You are not dead,' went on the son&mdash;'you are alive, and
coming away from Solomons' with the receipt in your pocket.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the ghost.</p>

<p>'Where do you go?'</p>

<p>'I go home and straight up to my consulting room and lock the
receipt up in my cash box.'</p>

<p>'Go on. Perhaps you took it out again.'</p>

<p>'I do take it and the other papers out again&mdash;my lease
and other things. I look at the date of the lease; then I put
them back again.'</p>

<p>'You are sure you put them all back again?'</p>

<p>'I think so, but I am not sure.'</p>

<p>Robert was at fault. 'We have searched everywhere. The cash
box was locked, with the lease and other papers in it, but no
receipt.'</p>

<p>'I remember nothing more but that.'</p>

<p>'Ask him about the prescription?' I whispered. 'What did
you do with the prescription of "Bunce's miraculous moist
powders?"'</p>

<p>'I wrote it out on a piece of paper, and put it in the leaves
of my <i>Nomenclature</i>.'</p>

<p>That was all that could be obtained. Further questioning could
elucidate nothing fresh&mdash;no clue of any sort. Robert made
some upward passes and restored the ghost of his parent to
consciousness.</p>

<p>'You didn't succeed, then,' he said.</p>

<p>'Yes, I did. Look at the clock. You've been in a hypnotic
trance for over fifteen minutes.'</p>

<p>'Did you find out anything?'</p>

<p>'You took the receipt home and locked it up in your cash
box.'</p>

<p>'So I did; I remember now. Well, go on.'</p>

<p>'It was not in the cash box when you died. You took the papers
out once to look at the date of your lease, but, to the best of
your belief, put them all back again.'</p>

<p>The old man seemed very perplexed.</p>

<p>'How did Solomons know the receipt was lost?' 'He got it out
of me in an unguarded moment.'</p>

<p>'I'll get at him in an unguarded moment. Did I tell you
anything about the "moist powders?"'</p>

<p>'Yes; you put the prescription in amongst the leaves of your
<i>Nomenclature</i>.'</p>

<p>'So I did, so I did. I remember it all now. How weak my memory
must have got just before I died. Have you got the book
still?'</p>

<p>'Yes; but I have never opened it, as I have my own
<i>Nomen</i>.'</p>

<p>'Anyway, I'll commence on Solomons. I'll frighten the soul out
of him.'</p>

<p>He was starting off to put Solomons through a preliminary
canter, when I detained him.</p>

<p>'You have not delivered the committee's message,' I reminded
him.</p>

<p>'No, no; I forgot. They accept your challenge, and will meet
you here at 12 o'clock to-night.'</p>

<p>'How about this top-sawyer ghost? Can I make him angry?'</p>

<p>'Yes, but don't; he could hurt you.'</p>

<p>The old fellow vanished, but suddenly reappeared.</p>

<p>'It's against rules to give advice, but Robert, you hypnotise
him if you can.'</p>

<p>Then he went out for good.</p>

<p><br>
WE made ourselves comfortable against midnight, and passed the
time in conversation.</p>

<p>Dr. Bunce always enjoyed my conversation, like you do. (Jim
never gave anybody else a chance to speak, when he was, what he
called, conversing.) Young Bunce was in good spirits. He said,
anyhow, if Solomons was not frightened out of the money, he would
make a good thing out of the moist powders, which was a real good
medicine.</p>

<p>Midnight struck, or at least it would have done so, but my
clock doesn't strike. Nothing happened for awhile.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bunce shivered, and said it was cold. I pushed the
whisky bottle over to him, and then saw that the door was slowly
opening. I confess I felt more frightened when we were watching
that door slowly, slowly, opening than at anything we saw
afterwards, and Bob says the same. What was coming in so
silently?</p>

<p>A hand appeared&mdash;a huge hand, of a dull white corpse
color; a hand big enough for a giant of immense size. It came in
the room, and the arm also&mdash;a white, ghastly, bloodless arm.
To watch it, and think what creature must own such an arm that
was so gradually creeping towards us, was the most awful
thing.</p>

<p>Presently it began to search about, as though seeking
something&mdash;as though striving to clutch its prey with those
terrible looking fingers. It hovered over the table, and every
second we expected it to lay hold of us.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bunce broke the spell of fear.</p>

<p>'Don't take our whisky,' he said, in a choky kind of voice.
That saved us. I mustered up a very artificial laugh. The arm was
suddenly withdrawn, and the door closed angrily with a bang.</p>

<p>'That part of the show is over,' I remarked with relief; and I
may tell you that it was a near go with both of us.</p>

<p>Then the door opened again, and a ghastly figure
entered&mdash;a mutilated human form. The nose and ears had been
cut off, the eyes gouged from the sockets, the mouth cut into a
hideous slit, and landless, bleeding stumps were extended towards
us.</p>

<p>As the thing advanced, a sound of agonised sobbing accompanied
it, seemed to hover around it, and fill the room with the
moanings of a being under torture. Horrible as this appearance
was, it did not affect either of us as did that cruel searching
hand. It wandered round the room, waving its stumps, and moving
its horrible face this way and that. Then, coming close to Bunce,
it put its face down, and a soft woman's voice of great sweetness
seemed to come from the gaping mouth:</p>

<p>'Kiss me, my lost love.'</p>

<p>This spoilt the whole show, arid both of us burst into a loud
laugh!&mdash;the effect was too absurd. In an instant the thing
vanished, and the door slammed. 'I think they'll fail now,' said
Robert. 'D&mdash;n it; look out!'</p>

<p>He started up, for a snake, a death-adder, was wriggling about
on the table.</p>

<p>'It's that Tomfool ghost,' I said. 'Let it alone.'</p>

<p>We did so, and it wriggled away.</p>

<p>Then darkness fell on us. We could see the lamp like a speck
of fire, but it gave no light. I struck a match, but it was just
the same. Cold, slimy hands pawed over our faces; they circled
round our throats, as if threatening to strangle us; and the room
was full of a rustling sound, as though it was filled with
gliding forms. It was very disagreeable, but we constrained
ourselves to sit still, and presently the light shot up again,
and the room was empty.</p>

<p>Bunce reached out to the bottle, but it was instantly snatched
away.</p>

<p>'Put that back,' he said, 'that's an old trick I'd be ashamed
of.'</p>

<p>The bottle was returned, but when he went to lift it it seemed
rooted to the table.</p>

<p>'That's only fit for a side show,' I remarked, and the bottle
was free, and we helped ourselves. For two or three hours or more
they tried it on in all manner of ways, but as they did not
succeed at first they lost their chance, and the performance only
got amusing.</p>

<p>'I'm tired of this,' I said at last. 'It's our turn now.
Where's that boss ghost who frightens cats and babies?'</p>

<p>'I'm here,' said a voice in my ear that made me jump.</p>

<p>'Well, just appear; show yourself, man &mdash;don't hide.'</p>

<p>'How shall I appear?'</p>

<p>'As a good strong man,' I said.</p>

<p>Immediately there stood by the table a brawny looking fellow,
dressed in bush fashion.</p>

<p>'Are you the ghost who can materialise himself solid?' I
asked.</p>

<p>'Smell that,' he returned, thrusting a brawny fist against my
nose.</p>

<p>'You'll do,' I remarked. 'Now, strong as you are, you can't
stare at this tumbler for five minutes and then look my friend in
the face.'</p>

<p>The ghost sneered; then fixed his eyes on the tumbler and
stared at it. At the end of five minutes Bunce made some passes
over him, and then told him to look up. It was all right; we had
him safely hypnotised. We had our plans arranged also.</p>

<p>'You know what ringbarking is?' said Bunce.</p>

<p>'Yes,' answered the mesmerised ghost.</p>

<p>'Then, as soon as it is daylight you can go and begin, and
don't leave off until you're allowed to.'</p>

<p>It was just beginning to dawn when that materialised ghost
started ringbarking, and it was dusk in the evening when Bunce
removed the influence, and a sadder, wiser ghost returned to
spirit land. We told the men that it was a bet that he could keep
ringbarking all day without knocking off, and to their surprise
he did it. There were many spectators during the time he was
employed, and if the ghosts were listening they must have been
edified by the critical remarks passed. What surprised everybody
was the disappearance of such a master ringbarker; but, as you
may believe, he was never seen in this district again.</p>

<p>I drove Bunce into town again, and he started off for Sydney
and Lucy, his books being packed up there. A week afterwards I
got a letter from him. This is it:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Jim,</span></p>

<p class="letter">
I owe you a lot for that ghost racket. What do you
think&mdash;my old father had written out the prescription for
the 'miraculous moist powders' on the back of the receipt which
he must have left lying on the desk when he opened the cashbox to
look at the date of the lease.</p>

<p class="letter">
I went to Solomons, and found him ill and penitent, and
only too willing to make restitution. He did not enter into
details as to what had occurred, but from what he let drop I
fancy dad kept his word, and Solomons has been having a really
bad time lately.</p>

<p class="letter">
Lucy and I are to be married very soon, and then we'll come
up and see you. As I said, I owe you something, and, by George,
I'll pay it! When the 'miraculous moist powders' are ready for
the market you shall be the first man I will doctor with
them.</p>

<p><br>
'I DON'T know what the moist powders are good for,' said Jim,
as he finished the letter; 'but I'll be hanged if he will.'</p>

<h3><i>Australasian</i>, Melbourne, 16 Nov 1889</h3>

<p class="cp"><i>[The Richmond and Croydon in this story are in outback Queensland. &mdash;TW]</i></p>
<br>

<p class="first">
"I NEVER said much about my domestic troubles, did I Jack?"</p>

<p>The speaker, a tall, big-jointed man, with a mild
good-tempered face, was seated on the cross-bar of a bunk at the
entrance of a tent. He was smoking with an air of tranquil
enjoyment, and lazily watching his companion, a young fellow of
about five-and-twenty, with a bright, sunny face, who was engaged
in sharpening some tent-pegs.</p>

<p>"No, Joe; you've hinted they were not exactly of the common
order, but you never went into details."</p>

<p>"Well," returned Joe, "I belong down to the Richmond way, and
have got a tidy little farm there now. But worse luck, an old man
and his daughter had the next farm, and nothing would suit the
old man but I must be his son-in-law. He got at me all
roads&mdash;told me how the poor girl was crying her eyes out at
my cruelty, which she never did&mdash;until at last, for the sake
of peace and quiet, I did it."</p>

<p>"And did you get what you wanted?" asked Jack, who, having
finished his pegs, was filling his pipe.</p>

<p>"What? Peace and quiet? Why, the rowing commenced almost
before the ceremony was over. Such a pair for tongue as that old
man and his daughter you never came across. You see they had been
going for each other all their lives, and now they had me for a
common object, and they made the most of it. Of all the
wicked-tongued old men, that man was the worst. Being my
father-in-law, I couldn't well hit my hand to him; so when he got
extra bad I used to shake him all the way from the house to the
back gate, and my wife pitching into me all the way with whatever
weapon was handy. Lord, I was never without a couple of black
eyes in those days."</p>

<p>"You got peace and quiet with a vengeance." assented Jack.
"Things got worse and worse, and one night, after I'd shook the
old man choking speechless. I went back to the house, packed up a
few things, told my wife that there was the farm and some money
in the bank for her use, walked out, and left her before she got
her breath properly. I heard afterwards she advertised for me in
the papers to come back and all would be forgiven, but as I had
done nothing to want forgiveness for I didn't go back. No, I came
up here, we fell in together, and now this is heaven."</p>

<p>His companion looked round with a peculiar
smile&mdash;certainly no place could have been more unlike the
popular idea of heaven. They were camped on the outskirts of
Croydon, on a clay box flat. The time was the middle of summer;
not a vestige of grass was visible. Every horse-pad or
wheel-track was indicated by about six inches of fine floury
dust. The leaves of the trees seemed crisp and withered, and
crackled with the intermittent puffs of hot wind. In the west the
sun was setting behind a lurid storm-cloud, the edge of which was
every now and again illuminated by a blaze of reflected
lightning.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Jack, after gazing round at this picture of
heaven, "it was your love of peace and quiet made you out Roaring
Bill through the window the other night. By the way, did you pay
old Jenkins for the damage?"</p>

<p>"Well, Bill would keep picking up quarrels, and as long as
he stopped in the bar there to no chance of peaceable yarn.
As for paying for the window when old Jenkins asked me. I
offered to show him by putting him through that I never
actually touched the window, but Bill did it all."</p>

<p>"Did he agree?"</p>

<p>"No, said he'd make it up out of Bill."</p>

<p>"And was it a love of peace and quiet made you roll into the
bullocky the other day for flogging a lame bullock?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he'd have only got mixed up with the police over it, and
taken away from his team, so I gave him a practical
illustration."</p>

<p>"Yes, you knocked him down, took the whip from him, gave him a
couple of old-man cuts, and asked him how he liked it himself.
You'll do, Joe. Now I'll just tighten up the fly with a few extra
pegs, and if the storm does come we are all taut; and tomorrow
we'll see what my gully turns out."</p>

<p>Like everyone else the two friends had had to register their
claim, a very promising reef, until the break-up of the drought
and the arrival of machinery could enable them to work. Meanwhile
Jack had been doing a little prospecting, and had dropped on a
patch in a gully some fifteen miles distant that he thought might
pay them to stack against a thunderstorm fall. The horses were a
long way off on one of the few bits of feed still left, so the
two resolutely made two journeys on foot with their belongings,
there being a very little water in the gully that might possibly
last them, if not intruded on, for a week or two.</p>

<p>The new camp settled, the two set to work with a will. Every
night the storm-clouds would gather, and every night they would
sunder and vanish with loud thunder, and a few heavy drops of
rain. At last, when they had worked out the patch, it came. Next
morning the gully was a torrent of muddy water, and then
commenced the most satisfactory part of a digger's career,
washing up. Especially when, as in this case, their luck was far
better than they expected.</p>

<p>They were about half-way through their work when a horseman
rode down the gully, and pulled up where they were busy.</p>

<p>"Well boys," he said, "struck a patch?"</p>

<p>Jack, who knew him well, nodded and laughed.</p>

<p>"Anything left, old man, for we are all about stone
broke."</p>

<p>The two mates indicated the most likely places they knew of,
and next day their solitude was invaded by a party of four, who
were shortly followed by others, until the once lonely gully was
quite a lively camp.</p>

<p>Some did tolerably well, but as usually happens, the pick of
it had gone to the first prospectors. Joe and his mate had
cleaned up everything, and were thinking of shifting their camp
back to their reef the next day, for, as Jack said, they could
afford to do a bit of pointing now.</p>

<p>"I saw that vagabond Jimmy the Greek sneaking round here
to-day," said Joe. "Wonder what he's up to; no good, I
reckon."</p>

<p><br>
THAT night Jack was aroused by Joe crying. "I've got him!
Strike a light, quick, he's stuck me in the arm."</p>

<p>Jack had a light in a minute and found Joe with the blood
dripping from his arm, holding by both wrists Jimmy the
Greek.</p>

<p>The other men soon came in, Jimmy was secured, and Joe's arm
bandaged up. He said he was awakened in the night by a hand
fumbling under his pillow; he caught the wrist belonging to the
hand, and immediately received a stab in the arm. Making a grab
with the other hand, he was lucky enough to secure the hand with
the knife and held the man until Jack came to his assistance.</p>

<p>There was great discussion as to Jimmy's fate, but it was
decided as the best thing to hand him over to the police at
Croydon. Joe loudly lamented he had not shot him at once.</p>

<p>"It would have only been justifiable homicide," he said, "and
everything would have gone off in peace and quiet. Now there'll
be a trial and all sorts of bother."</p>

<p>Jimmy was escorted into Croydon next day, and Joe and his
partner followed. But a knife-stab in the middle of a North
Queensland summer is not to be trifled with. When they got in Joe
was feverish; next day he was delirious, and then for a week or
two he began to hover between life and death.</p>

<p>The hospital at Croydon was still in embryo, so Jack got a hut
and took his patient there, where he nursed him with all the
tenderness of a generous and affectionate nature.</p>

<p>Often the sick man would murmur his favourite formula when
Jack put the cooling bandages from the water-bag round his hot
forehead&mdash;"Ah! it's just Heaven!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jimmy the Greek was waiting his trial in the sultry
oven of a lock-up, with the agreeable uncertainty of wondering
whether he would be tried for his life or not. Jack's nursing and
Joe's constitution triumphed. In due course he was able to appear
at the police court, and the case was sent down to Townsville,
where Jimmy got peace and quiet for seven years. Joe had
determined to take a trip south to get his strength back, so his
young partner returned alone. Jack had been back some months,
putting in a pretence of work at the claim, and praying like
everybody else for the rain to come, when one evening he espied a
tall familiar figure approaching from the direction of
Croydon.</p>

<p>It was Joe right enough, with a new felt hat with six inches
of crape on it. He said nothing, but gave Jack's hand a mighty
grip that made him cry out; subsided on to the cross-bar of his
old bunk, and commenced to fill his pipe.</p>

<p>"Anyone got this bunk?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No old man. I knew you would turn up some day; the boys have
a tent of their own." By this time Joe had filled and lighted
his pipe. He gave two or three puffs and calmly observed, "Now this is
heaven."</p>

<p>"Well, Joe, your trip has done you a world of good, but who
are you in mourning for?"</p>

<p>Joe regarded the crape waggishly.</p>

<p>"Father-in-law; she would make me wear it as a mark of
respect."</p>

<p>"I say," said Jack, sitting up suddenly, "none of your doing,
I hope, none of that shaking business."</p>

<p>"No, lad, I was away. Cussed himself into a fit, and fit had
the best of it, couldn't cuss himself out of it. Had a
first-class funeral, and has got an epitaph stating he was
beloved and venerated by all who knew him. Funny, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"And your wife?"</p>

<p>"Worse and worse. Will have it that I'm living a life of riot
and debauchery up here. Said I got knifed over some scandalous
female: says she heard all about it."</p>

<p>Joe was silent; then commenced shaking with suppressed
laughter.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, you old fool?" said Jack.</p>

<p>"Heard all about you, too. Who do you suppose you are?"</p>

<p>"Why myself, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Not at all. You're a good-looking girl dressed up in man's
clothes."</p>

<p>The combined shout of laughter from the two nearly startled
the whole camp into life.</p>

<p>"Yes. Jack, you're a shameless hussy, following of me round
dressed in boys clothes, and if ever she gets a hold of you
she'll put a mark on you will spoil your good looks."</p>

<p>"I say, Joe, this is getting serious. I'll clear out. You're
too dangerous a mate to have."</p>

<p>"And how have you left things?" asked Jack, after a
pause.</p>

<p>"The old man's farm came to his daughter, and, I suppose, is
mine; but anyhow she's got the use of both, and a tidy bit of
money in the bank. There's a slip of some sort of cousin knocking
about down there, so I put him on the old man's place. He's not
much account; but he's got a steady man under him, and can't do
much harm. He was brought up boy and girl with the wife, so she
can take it out of him when she feels so inclined. Strike a match
and light a candle, Jack; I'll show you her photograph. I had it
taken this time when there was peace for five minutes."</p>

<p>Jack looked at it curiously. Surely there was some mistake; he
had expected to see a vulgar shrew, with a miserable temper
showing in every line of her face, and here was a mild,
trustful-looking girl's face that looked as though it always shed
around an atmosphere of peace and good temper.</p>

<p>"This is a puzzler, Joe; why, she looks a perfect saint."</p>

<p>"Doesn't she? If that photograph could speak, you'd hear a
saint talk; as for language, a bullocky isn't near her."</p>

<p>"Well, she's too young and pretty to be left alone there,
Joe."</p>

<p>"Think so," said Joe uneasily. "But no, she's good enough, all
but her temper. No, no, old man, don't you hint anything like
that."</p>

<p>Jack apologised, and the two went off to sleep: but the
younger was aroused in the middle of the night by the elder
striking a match and lighting his pipe.</p>

<p>"Jack," he said, "you and I have been mates now nearly two
years."</p>

<p>"About that, old man."</p>

<p>"And never had a word, not even a civil growl, all the time;
have we?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so."</p>

<p>"Strange now, isn't it, considering you're a scandalous
female, going about with me dressed up in boy's clothes;" and Joe
went off into a fit of chuckling.</p>

<p>"I believe," he said, after a pause, "that Roaring Bill had
been about there; he comes from that way."</p>

<p><br>
FOR some weeks peace and quiet reigned, and; Joe shone like a
beatified saint. Then came a thunderbolt. It was a letter from
the agent, who was Joe's business man on the Richmond. The
ne'er-do-well cousin and Joe's wife had gone off together, taking
what cash there was in the bank and whatever money they could
raise by the sale of the farm stock.</p>

<p>Jack could say nothing in the face of such a blow, but his
heart bled for his partner. All light seemed to go out of Joe's
life at one breath. His disgrace was more than he could bear; it
seemed to him that every one pointed at him as the man whose wife
had run away with another man. He shrank from everyone but his
partner, to whom he was always the same, and Jack impotently
cursed the woman who had broken such a trustful, generous
nature.</p>

<p>Six months had passed, affairs were prospering with the two
men, and here was the outlook of a fortune ahead of them. From a
whim of Joe's, which Jack humoured, they still occupied a tent
instead of putting up a hut, and one night Jack was awakened by
the familiar scratch of a match, and knew that poor sleepless Joe
was trying to while his thoughts away with his pipe.</p>

<p>"Jack," he said at last, "you know when the trouble first came
you asked me if I was going to take any action in the matter, and
I told you no. I had my reasons."</p>

<p>"Yes, old man."</p>

<p>"Well, I've thought and thought many a long night, and I've
worked it out that I did not do my duty by that woman."</p>

<p>"What more could you have done, Joe?"</p>

<p>"You said. 'She's too young and pretty to be left alone,' and
I left her alone."</p>

<p>"But she drove you from her every time."</p>

<p>"I should have stood it. Now they would run through that money
in no time, for he's a wasteful young hound; and as he never
could earn a penny, by this time I know they must be in want; or
she is, for he'd leave her when the money was gone. Jack, I'm
going down south to find her and save her."</p>

<p>Jack could say nothing. Evidently Joe's resolution was taken,
and no words would move him. At last he said. "We have a good
manager; if you go I will go and help you."</p>

<p>Joe sprung from his bunk, and without a word came over and
wrung his friend's hand hard: then he went back, and both slept
till daylight.</p>

<p>With a purpose to work out Joe regained some of his old
tranquil humour and brightness, and after due business
arrangements had been completed the pair were soon on their way
south.</p>

<p>Melbourne or Sydney were the goals they looked upon as the
most likely places wherein to trace the errant couple: but they
searched for some time, with trained assistance, without getting
a clue.</p>

<p>One afternoon Jack was coming home through Lower George-street
when he saw a sight that always roused his sense of shame and
pity&mdash;a young woman was being taken to the lockup by two
constables. One had hold of each arm, and she was fighting
desperately but silently to free her wrists. She raised her head
as Jack passed, and in an instant be recognised the Madonna-like
face of the photograph, Joe's wife.</p>

<p>There was soon little doubt, for throwing all restraint away,
she commenced a torrent of abuse against the constables that made
Jack shudder to listen to. He had to follow. Never ceasing in her
stream of invectives, she was forced on step by step until the
door of the lock-up closed on her and her conductors. Then Jack
returned sorrowfully to tell Joe what he had seen; but Joe took
it quietly.</p>

<p>"I expected it," he said, "all the more reason I must do my
duty now and save her."</p>

<p>They returned to the police office, and Joe introduced his
business and himself to the inspector. He met with the most
cordial sympathy; the matter could be easily arranged by entering
into certain recognisances for good behaviour, she would be
released on the opening of the court in the morning, but the
inspector strongly advised him not to bail her out that night. In
this Jack backed him up. "You must make some arrangements first,
man: you could not take her to an hotel, or she might fly out and
disgrace you before everybody." Joe assented to reason, and then
obtained permission to see his wife. He was shown into the cell,
but what passed between them Jack never heard.</p>

<p>By the time the court opened the next morning Joe had secured
a furnished cottage in one of the suburbs, and there he commenced
on his work of reclamation. Jack started immediately for the
north; to him the sight of the woman was positively hateful. Joe
kept him posted up as to how things went.</p>

<p>"The last craze," he wrote, "is that I'm an idle, loafing
vagabond. Why am I not at work at something instead of dawdling
my time about Sydney? Black eyes are not going yet, but language
is still incurable."</p>

<p>At last came a letter in black. The miserable woman had caught
a cold through going out bareheaded in a storm in a fit of
temper, and she had ceased to be a burden to anybody any
more.</p>

<p>Joe arrived soon after his letter; he looked well and almost
his old self. "Jack," he said, when he had got himself into his
favourite heavenly seat&mdash;"I didn't tell you all by letter,
because there are some things I would sooner speak about than
write about. One thing, I don't blame myself like I did at first.
That woman would have gone wrong with all the care in the world.
After she died I discovered that that young cousin had found us
out, and she used to give him money on the sly. Many a time she
used to sham one of her tantrums to go out to meet him, and she
caught her death going out that stormy night for the same
purpose."</p>

<p>"Lucky for him you never caught him."</p>

<p>"It was, but he was always mighty careful of himself."</p>

<p>"Well, old man, let's forget all the miserable past, and try
for peace and quiet in future."</p>

<p>Joe nodded, and his eyes glistened.</p>

<p>Again the familiar scratch of a match roused Jack up in the
middle of the night. "What on earth do you want, you restless old
cuss?" he asked discontentedly.</p>

<p>"Jack, I've got an awful idea. I'd just got it all cut and
dried, everything laid out for a long a spell of peace and quiet,
and then all of a sudden it came on me like a knock-down. You'll
be getting married one of these days."</p>

<p>Jack modestly admitted the possibility.</p>

<p>"There, say no more, I won't disturb you again, but my sleep's
spoilt till I get used to the notion."</p>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>15. -- A CHRISTMAS OF THE PAST</h2>

<h3><i>Australian Town and Country Journal, Sydney, 9 Dec
1908</i></h3>

<h3>1. --  FROM AN OLD DIARY</h3>

<p class="first"><i><b>December 24, 187&mdash;</b></i> Leave camp
for a three days' trip to the West, keeping further to the
northward than where we went on the unlucky day when three horses
died of thirst. All the horses are now in very good condition,
thanks to our long detention here. I intend to make a push to the
west as far as I can get. Hillesly is going with me with a horse
packed with water-bags. We'll leave them hung up on a tree to
await my return, then he will go back to the camp with the
horse.</p>

<p>I shall take the cob, as he is a very hardy brute; but he is
not fond of being alone, so will want watching the first night.
Hung the bags of water on a small bloodwood tree at about 3
o'clock; then Hillesly turned back. The bags are on the bank of a
small, dry creek. I shall thus get a drink for my horse on my
return journey, 15 miles before reaching our camp, which may mean
all the difference.</p>

<p>Hillesly was unlucky in his shooting yesterday, so I have only
two flock-pigeons to last me till I get back. However, he vows
that he'll get an emu or a plain turkey against my return.</p>

<br>

<p class="first"><i><b>December 25&mdash;</b></i>
Passed through splendidly-grassed country all day yesterday.
Mostly downs, with Mitchell grass and other good grasses; no sign
of water. . My cob nearly gave me the slip last night. I had been
keeping awake listening to him till past midnight, when he
stopped feeding, and I suppose I fell asleep. When I awoke I
could not hear a sound. The silence was intense. I had brought a
small horse-bell with me, but though the silence was so complete
that, according to the common saying, "you could hear a pin
drop," although in reality neither I nor anybody else ever heard
a pin drop, not the most distant tinkle, rewarded me.</p>

<p>I was gazing up sadly at the stars, and thinking of the long,
hot tramp that lay before me on the morrow, when suddenly, afar
off, came, the blessed sound of the bell. It was only a faraway
refrain, but the bell was one of the old-fashioned, bullfrog
kind, and it was impossible to definitely locate the distance.
Anyway the horse was within reach. I took a careful survey of
those companions of a lonely man, the faithful stars, and
definitely fixed the exact spot where the bell had sounded. Then
picking up my bridle, I started after the fugitive.</p>

<p>The bell sounded no more. Evidently the delinquent was a bit
tired with travelling in hobbles, and was having a rest. After
going the distance I calculated the bell had sounded, I paused to
have a good listen. All was still on that wide, treeless expanse,
and though my eyes were then pretty keen, I could see no object
silhouetted against the skyline. Suddenly, apparently not a
hundred yards away from me, came a low and welcome snort. There
was the giddy cob, in a low hollow of the downs, taking his
rest.</p>

<p>I commenced to whistle cheerfully, both because I did not wish
to startle him by suddenly breaking on his peaceful slumbers, and
really, because I did feel relieved at seeing him. He, too,
seemed pleased, and when I put my hand on him greeted me with a
cordial whinny; as if to say, "Glad to see you, old man. Awfully
lonely out here, isn't it?"</p>

<p>I slipped the bridle on his head, and started back. Now there
was only one indication of where I had been camped, and that was
my saddle lying on the bare plain, for there was no need for
timber or a fire, but when I reached the spot where I made sure
that I had left it, no saddle was visible. So, knowing that it
was no good fooling about in the dark, I concluded to wait until
daylight, as it was not far off now.</p>

<p>When the dawn came the saddle was but two or three hundred
yards away, but, of course, it was not able to announce its near
presence. "So the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no
token." I soon saddled up, and was on my way westward once
more.</p>
<hr>

<p class="first"><i><b>December 26&mdash;</b></i>
For several hours the level country was treeless and
unchanged; but about 10 o'clock a distant low line of blue began
to show above the horizon to the northward; and just then I saw
that I had come upon the traces of a passing thunderstorm. It had
evidently fallen over a fortnight before, for the grass was green
and fresh; but there was no place that would retain water. I
turned slightly towards the timber, which had now got very
distinct. The cob kept making snatches at the green grass as we
went on. Poor devil, he was getting thirsty as the sun grew
hotter and hotter.</p>

<p>We reached the timber in about a couple of hours, and found
that it indicated a change of soil; the familiar but unwelcome
spinifex appeared ahead. The traces of the thunderstorm were
still visible; so after a short look round I got off under a
beautiful <i>bauhinia</i> tree to have a rest and take council
with myself in default of anybody else. My horse wanted water,
but not badly, and he would evidently last through the next day,
and carry me back to where I left the bags, even if I did not
come across any water; so things seemed pretty right to have a
further search, as I had a little water in my bag.</p>

<p>Feeling inspirited by my reflections, I decided to attack one
of the pigeons. What was my horror and disappointment to find
that they were both bad! My saddle-pouch was lined with black,
shiny leather, and as it had been on the sunny side of my saddle,
my sole stock of rations was uneatable. I was very hungry, but
had not yet reached the stage of being able to tackle tainted
bird. If they had been a little high and gamey, they might have
gone down; but they were too far gone. There was nothing for it,
and the pigeons quickly became the prey of the surprised tenants
of a neighboring, ant-hill.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I had still a morsel of tobacco with me, so with
a smoke and a drink of water, I tried to forget my lost dinner,
and started on once more. The spinifex belt with its gravelly
soil was evidently the crest of the long, low watershed of the
downs country, so I turned west once more, and rode alongside it,
hoping to cross a stray rivulet that might still hold some
remains of the thunderstorm I did find one or two, but only found
a hole where the soil was still damp, to the infinite disgust of
my horse, who smelt the moist earth, and started to paw the
ground, as though he fancied himself a second Moses.</p>

<p>Still on to the westward, when suddenly the spinifex forest on
my right hand retreated backward, and before me the downs
declined into a broad valley. At the bottom, seen through the
heat haze of the afternoon, were several black dots, which, as I
rode on, resolved themselves into separate trees. There was
seemingly a streamlet of some kind there. The trees were stunted,
and grew far apart, but the grass was green. Suddenly a flock of
small birds, almost the first signs of life I had yet seen,
arose, wheeled and circled in the air for a few minutes, and then
descended, chattering loudly at each other as they settled
down.</p>

<p>I recognised them at once, the pugnacious little spur-winged
plover. I was as sure of water as if they had been a flight of
ducks. A breath of wind had evidently conveyed the news to my
horse, for he cocked his ears, and was eager to go on. Very soon
we were on the brink of a fine serpentine lagoon, and my horse
had enjoyed a most welcome drink.</p>

<p>But greater surprise was in store for me. There on the bank
was a good-sized camp of natives, all standing staring at me,
without making a sound. The trees were stunted coolibahs, and
most of the women had climbed up these, while the men were
grouped around the stems. They still kept silence until I made a
step in their direction, when they started shouting and
energetically waving their hands at me to go back. The nearer I
came to them, the more excited they became, but showed no weapons
nor seemed hostile, only most anxious that I should clear
out.</p>

<p>As I advanced nearer to them their motions became more
excited, until I thought of the old signal of holding both hands
up to show that my intentions were peaceful. It worked like a
charm; they instantly stopped shouting and held up their hands
likewise. They did not object to my coming close to them, but
professed great terror at my horse, and when he gave a snort they
all gave a start of real or feigned alarm.</p>

<p>After a time the ladies descended from the branches of the
trees, and I found that most of them had caught up either a
piccaniny or a dingo pup in their flight. The kiddies were mostly
plump, brown, little monkeys, for the babies of the aborigines
are not black for a few years. They had stacks of fresh water
mussels in the camp, and gave me a fresh-caught fish, which I
gladly cooked at one of their fires and ate. My meal finished, my
dusky friends appeared to wish me to "stand not upon the order of
going, but go at once."</p>

<p>I was rather-glad to get away, for truth to tell, I had no
firearms of any sort with me. My own revolver had been disabled,
and my rifle was too heavy for the work, so on the whole I was
glad that they were so friendly. During the time I was in the
camp I had noticed a group of half a dozen big boys, who kept
apart and did not approach me, and seemed inclined to conceal
themselves behind tree trunks. One white bearded old man appeared
to hover near them and see that they did not push themselves
forward.</p>

<p>As the sun was getting low, and both I and the natives seemed
to have had enough of each other's company, I made preparations
to depart. They all of them solemnly and silently watched me as
long as I could see the camp, and then I feel sure that one or
two stole after me a short distance, to make sure that I really
went away.</p>

<p>I was five or six miles away before it struck me what was the
real reason for their strongly displayed wish for my departure.
They were about holding some of their ceremonies, and the group
of young boys that kept by themselves, were about to undergo the
rite that made them men. This rite is very select, so it was no
wonder that they did not wish a white spectator. Camped before I
got off the traces of the thunderstorm, the horse well fed, and I
got several snatches of sleep. No sign of the blacks.</p>
<br>


<p class="first"><i><b>December 27&mdash;</b></i>
Got back to camp early this morning, bringing the water bags I
had picked up on my way back. Found all well, and Hillesly had
kept his word and managed to get an emu, which I enjoyed very
much. My companions were delighted to hear of the water, but did
not lay much stress on the blacks being there.</p>

<p class="cp"><i>(End of the extract from my diary.)</i></p>

<h3>2. -- HILLESLY'S ADVENTURE</h3>

<p class="first">
THE adventure that afterwards befell Hillesly was in some sort
a sequel to my meeting with the blacks, but I never saw them
again. When we removed to the lagoon a few days afterwards, they
had departed, and only the remains of the camp was there to tell
the story. But I shall never forget the last look I had of them
when I looked back that afternoon, the savage figures grouped
there, all standing motionless gazing, gazing, after me as if my
disappearance was most urgently needed.</p>

<p>It was four years later, the country then untraversed, was
just being stocked and opened up, and Hillesly had been engaged
by a firm to take a mob of cattle up to the same lagoon. They had
formed a temporary camp there, and were waiting for the wet
season to be over before beginning their work. The blacks had not
been openly hostile, but had kept away from them, and showed no
signs of wishing to be friendly.</p>

<p>Hillesly was sleeping under a tarpaulin beneath which they had
the stores stowed. The other men were camped in a couple of tents
close at hand. Hillesly had rigged himself up a bunk and mosquito
net, for the latter were very bad when there was a break of
sunshine. One night he woke up with that strange feeling of there
being uncanny lurking about. It. was a fairly bright moonlight
night, and he lay for a while listening, but without avail.</p>

<p>Suddenly four black figures appeared in front of the opening
of the tarpaulin, and stood there silently watching. Each of
them had a big club, and their intentions were not evidently as
peaceable as when I had interviewed them. As he was in shadow and
under the net, the blacks could not make him out, which they
evidently wanted to. Both ends of the tarpaulin were open, and as
they looked through from moonlight to moonlight, they could see
the outline of one leg, for he was lying on his back with one
knee raised.</p>

<p>Instinctively Hillesly straightened his leg down, and the
natives quickly and silently dropped, thinking that he was
awaking. He was a cool fellow, and lay quite still, to see what
they would do. After a few minutes one sneaked in on his hands
and knees. It required the exercise of strong, firm nerves to
still remain quiet and feign sleep; but Hilllesly did so, and
presently was awarded. The blackfellow rose noiselessly up and
peered through the net with his face close against it.</p>

<p>Luckily Hillesly had taken his revolver under the net with
him. With his finger on the trigger he followed the black face
rising higher and higher, until he saw the eyeballs glitter; and
then fired. Hastily disentangling himself from the net, which was
smouldering, and putting it out with his hands, for it had caught
fire from the flash of the pistol, Hillesly had enough to occupy
him for a moment. But nothing more was needed; the blacks outside
had dropped their clubs with a clatter, and bolted.</p>

<p>The dying man, with a revolver bullet in his mouth and down
his throat, staggered out and fell to the earth, choking with
blood, where one of the men, who had run out of the tents,
stumbled over him. The three or four other men got away, but the
man who had been shot soon gasped his life out. The clubs that
they had left behind were very large ones, made for using with
both hands, so that they had evidently intended to make sure of
their game.</p>

<p>This was many long years ago, and the natives only linger in
the shape of a few half-civilised wanderers; but I believe that
they were never known to camp at that lagoon again.</p>

<p>What made them so quiet when I first saw the tribe I don't
know, unless it was as I suspected, and there was a ceremony
coming on, and they were anxious to get rid of me. In the country
news of this journal I have several times noticed, of late years,
the arrival overland of large mobs of bullocks to their
destination in the northern towns of this State, to be trucked
thence to Sydney, coming from the very far-away and then unknown
country where this incident occurred.</p>

<p class="first">
'THE beauty of gold,' said the weather-beaten prospector, 'is
that it's as good as cash from the moment you find
it&mdash;meaning, of course, alluvial gold,' he added, after a
moment's pause.</p>

<p>'That's so,' assented his mate. 'The mint will at once give
you its honest weight in clean, bright, wholesome sovereigns; but
they won't do the same for copper ore, or tin, or wolfram, or
anything else a man has the luck to strike.'</p>

<p>'Right oh,' went on the first speaker, 'and that's why I've
always followed gold, and that's why I'm in this God-forgotten
country at the present moment; but no company promoters, nor
mining agents, and brokers for me, to lick all the gilt off the
cake before a man has a chance to get a bite himself.'</p>

<p>Concluding his speech with vindictive emphasis, as though he
had formerly been a sufferer, the utterer of this philosophy got
on his legs and looked around.</p>

<p>They were in Central Australia, the surrounding country,
though hardly of the best description, was, nevertheless, not the
actual 'desert' of the far north-west, nothing but sand and
spinifex. A blind creek dragged its shallow, dry channel along to
a final disappearance, and on the tiny flats bordering its
'banks, was a growth of rough grass, off which three horse were
disgustedly trying to pick their mid-day meal. The ridges on
either side, were gravelly and rocky, and in the far distance the
crest of a range peeped up.</p>

<p>The two prospectors were out following their vocation on one
of the western slopes of the Macdonnell Range, and though many
people, from the great solitude that reigned around, would
consider themselves as being well within the borders of the great
unknown, the two fossickers only reckoned themselves to be the
proper distance from semi-civilisation and their fellow men, a
place where a man could enjoy uninterrupted peace and quiet.</p>

<p>They had caught their horses, preparatory to resuming their
journey, and were busy settling the somewhat cumbersome pack,
when an unmistakable pistol shot rang out clearly and sharply. It
sounded from across the ridge they were then on, and after
listening some minutes in surprise for a repetition the two men
mounted and rode in the direction of the sound. They gained the
crown of the ridge, then pulled up, and looked curiously
ahead.</p>

<p>The lightly-timbered decline was but a gradual slope, but
though the view was unimpeded, there was neither sign nor token
of life.</p>

<p>'It must have been a white man, and he must have left some
tracks,' said Rutter&mdash;the man who had spoken so strongly on
the subject of brokers. 'Let's have a look for them.'</p>

<p>'Yes, keep straight ahead, and we should cross them; wonder
who it can be?'</p>

<p>They continued in the same direction for about ten minutes,
then stopped simultaneously and abruptly. They had come across
the tracks; horse tracks going from west to east. Rutter looked
around at the grim solitude wherein was no sign of bird or
beast.</p>

<p>'Somebody on the same lay as ourselves; what the deuce could
he have been firing at&mdash;some new-chum fool blazing off his
revolver for sport. He'll live to want that cartridge some
day.'</p>

<p>'He shot something at any rate. What's that?' and the other
man pointed to an object lying on the tracks, in the direction
whence they came. They rode quickly over to examine it. It was
the body of a blackboy, huddled up as he had fallen; crouched oh
the ground lace downwards. They dismounted, and examined the dead
Rutter pointed to the still bleeding wound. Shot clean through
the heart from behind he must have told the poor beggar to look
round at something, and then have shot him&mdash;cowardly hound
he must be.'</p>

<p>Neither of the men boasted any overstrained sense of morality,
and the shooting of the boy under the pressure of self-defence
would not have shocked either of them, but this bore on its face
the evidence of such a cold-blooded, treacherous murder that they
felt the hot surge of shame at the thought that it was the act of
a white man's hand and brain.</p>

<p>One of them stooped and turned the body over. He was in
reality a boy, not a conventionally-called one, like most
blackboys no matter what their age. This one had been a
merry-faced little rascal, and looked as though he had been
laughing when the bullet did its cruel work.</p>

<p>'What on earth could he have shot the boy for?' mused Bob
Staines. 'Couldn't have been an accident.'</p>

<p>'No fear,' replied Rutter, 'no blooming accident about that.
Strikes me it's this way. He's struck a patch out west, he had to
come back for rations, and as he was afraid the boy would get
talking, he shot, him to keep his mouth shut.'</p>

<p>'But why not have shot him out at the place?' said
Staines.</p>

<p>'Why? Because there were only the two of them, and he wanted
some help with the horses. He's not so very far to go now.'</p>

<p>'A couple of days will bring him to the ten-mile camp. What
shall we do?'</p>

<p>'....<i>Cawwr, cawwr</i>,' croaked an alighting crow,
suddenly. Both men started; the bird had apparently appeared from
nowhere.</p>

<p>'<i>Cawwr, cawwr</i>,' croaked another in reply, as a second
one appeared, and settled alongside its mate, both of them
regarding the men knowingly, as much as to say, 'We know all
about it.'</p>

<p>'Wonderful birds; I could have sworn that there was not one
within coo-ee of here; but you'll be sold, you black brutes.
We've got the tools with us, and can spare time to cover the poor
wretch up.'</p>

<p>'The beauty of gold,' said Staines, quoting his mate's words
as they shovelled the last of the dirt over a shallow
grave.'</p>

<p>'All depends in what hands it gets, returned Rutter. 'Now,
look here. Staines; we can do no good following this skunk into
the camp, they will all treat it as a yarn. I vote that we follow
his tracks back and find out what he struck; we've got plenty of
rations, and we are bound to get water on his tracks. What do you
say?'</p>

<p>'I'm on; we'll have a look anyhow.'</p>

<p>They rode away, and the two crows, after a little
confabulation, had an unsatisfactory inspection of the new-made
grave, and followed them.</p>

<p><br>
BY following the tracks back Rutter and his mate Staines
arrived in a day or two at a patch of auriferous country, and it
had not been marked out and pegged, but the finder had evidently
relied upon the lonely seclusion of the place, which seemed
almost enough to warrant it against chance discovery.</p>

<p>There was a little permanent spring within about a mile of the
patch, and the two prospectors, respecting the original rights of
the finder, settled down to work at once, finding plenty of
payable dirt elsewhere. Naturally, the two men kept a sharp
lookout for the return of the unknown, whom they knew from
experience would not be too particular in the methods he adopted
when found that two more knew of the gold, although, as both
agreed, it was not worth the murder even of a black boy.</p>

<p>'The man must be half crazed, and has evidently got the most
exaggerated notions about the value of the find, and the value of
human life,' said Rutter one day.</p>

<p>'All the more dangerous on that account,' said Staines.</p>

<p>It was on the tenth day of their sojourn in the spot were they
were working that the remembered '<i>Cawwr, cawr</i>,' came from
a neighbouring limb. It was not long unanswered; there came
another '<i>Cawrr</i>,' and the fellow crow alighted, and both
gazed knowingly at the two men.</p>

<p>'Bless'd if I don't think it's the same old crow that turned
up at where we found the boy. He's come to warn us that there
murdering villain is coming,' said Staines.</p>

<p>Sure enough, not many hours had elapsed when there was the
tread of a horse, and a horseman rode up and stopped on the bank
within speaking distance of where the men were working. A
dark-featured man, evidently from his speech a foreigner,
presumably from the south of Europe.</p>

<p>'Good day, chaps! So you've found my little plant?'</p>

<p>Rutter stood up and regarded him curiously.</p>

<p>'Yes; we saw your pegs, and acted square. Got back all
right?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes. Had some trouble with the horses wid myself, that
keep me.'</p>

<p>'Couldn't raise a black boy, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'No; the one I bin have he run away. You no see him?'</p>

<p>'No,' replied Staines shortly, and at the instant the watching
crow gave a contemptuous '<i>Cawwr</i>.'</p>

<p>The man looked at him. 'Dat crow he bin follow me dis two
days.' He shook his head at the bird. 'I shoot you, old fellow,
directly,' he said. After a few more words the man rode back to
his camp.</p>

<p>'Wonder whether he came back the same way and saw that the boy
had been buried? I think not,' said Rutter, quietly.</p>

<p>The next few days passed in comparative peace, the dago, as
Staines had christened him, sticking sullenly to his camp, whence
were heard occasional reports throughout the day.</p>

<p>'Bah!' said Rutter, 'let him blaze away. There is nobody but
himself to shoot up there. Suppose he's pegging away at those
crows; they never come down here.'</p>

<p>The next morning the dago turned up.</p>

<p>'Mornin', you chaps, hab you not got one shotgun you can lend
me, dat crow he leave me no peese; he keep on wid his kawr, kawr,
all de day, and I no 'it 'im wid my revolver.'</p>

<p>'Very sorry, but haven't got such a thing.'</p>

<p>'Dat bird, 'e 'ave de evil eye; 'e drive me mad.'</p>

<p>And the man left, muttering strange oaths to himself.</p>

<p>'He's nearly mad already. Did you notice his eyes? And he does
not speak as plain as he did. Bully for the crow.'</p>

<p>The next day the man was down again. He looked wretched,
haggard, and with bloodshot eyes. Evidently he had not slept for
some time.</p>

<p>'How you get on?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Oh, fairly well,' said one. 'We're thinking of cleaning up
and making a shift tomorrow; the place didn't pan out like it
promised.'</p>

<p>'You go and leave me alone wid dat crow&mdash;but you not go
before to-morrow, and I must zleep. Will one man come and camp
wid me for one night, you see I am zick for sleep.'</p>

<p>Rutter interchanged a glance with his mate.</p>

<p>'No; you're camped too far away. Look here, come down here and
bring: your blanket; the crow doesn't visit us.'</p>

<p>'Thank you; I will come willingly. Oh, I haf not slept for
nights.'</p>

<p>That evening the man came. He refused any food, but lay and
smoked and chatted until long after dark; then, encouraged by the
peaceful silence, all hands fell asleep.</p>

<p>Through the dead silence of the dark bush rang a sudden cry
that woke both men.</p>

<p>'He is dere again. You no hear him, wid his infernal kawr; no,
but I stop it,' and the darkness was broken with a flash of
light, and a revolver shot rang out.</p>

<p>'Here, stop it; don't get shooting at random, or we'll take a
hand.' And the two men hastily scrambled up and gazed at the
demented man.</p>

<p>'He is here again, dat devil crow. Do you not 'ear 'im wis 'is
beastly kwar. Oh, I finish you,' and the haunted man, pistol in
hand, started across the little creek.</p>

<p>'Mind where you're going,' called out Rutter. 'You're right
amongst where we were working.'</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken before there was the sound of a stumble
and a fall, followed by a volley of oaths, a shot and another
fall, then succeeded an unbroken silence.</p>

<p>'I suppose we bad better go and see what has happened?' said
one, and the two prospectors picked their way across to the scene
of the disaster. The man, stumbling along in his blind fury, had
fallen over some rubbish in the creek, and in attempting to
recover himself had had an accident with his revolver, and was
now lying dead.</p>

<p>This much they made out by the fitful light of the stars, and
with no words of sympathy they agreed to let things rest until
the morning, and went back to resume their interrupted
slumbers.</p>

<p>Both men were awake at break of day, and while one was making
the fire up the flap of heavy wings broke the hush of early
morning, and the ominous crow and his mate came and alighted on a
bough, and gazed on the dead man with a sneering
'<i>Cawwr</i>.'</p>

<p>'I suppose we must bury the man and collect his traps
together, and whatever gold he's got stowed away, and hand horses
and everything over to the police. We've finished our work here,
anyway, but it is a confounded nuisance. For my part I felt
inclined to leave him to the investigations of our friend up
there.'</p>

<p>'<i>Cawwr</i>,' agreed the crow.</p>

<p>'What a nice mess we would be in if anyone came along just
now, and caught us with a dead body here; suspicious
circumstances, to say the least of it. Well, let's go to work and
carry out the programme.'</p>

<p>They did as Rutter had proposed, the South Australian
Government was the gainer by some gold and three or four horses,
the locality of the find became the scene of a small unprofitable
rush, and in a few months the incident was forgotten by all but
the two men who had been unwilling witnesses of the sordid
tragedy.</p>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>17. -- SOMETHING TO HIS ADVANTAGE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 23 July 1898</h3>

<p class="first">
THE noisy chattering of some laughing-jackasses aroused
Drummond from his stupor, and he looked curiously around and
tried to gather his scattered wits together. The pain in his head
was intolerable, but it put his thoughts on the right track.</p>

<p>He was just wheeling that infernal blue stag, when the brim of
his hat flopped over his eyes and his head came against a mulga
bough. Yes, that was it. He was lying about fifty or sixty yards
from the edge of the scrub, and the last thing he remembered was
catching sight of open country through the trees; then came the
blank.</p>

<p>What time was it now? Sundown or sunrise? He got up, weak and
staggery, wondering how the deuce it was that his brains had not
been knocked out. Helping himself along by the trees he reached
the edge of the scrub and looked across the open patch of
country. The two jackasses were on a bloodwood a short distance
away, and the mulga threw long shadows across the grass. The
fresh smell of the air told him it was morning, and the
unpleasant smell of a few gidea trees scattered through the mulga
strongly impregnated the atmosphere.</p>

<p>He had been lying senseless all the afternoon of the day
before, and all the night. He felt in his pouch for his pipe,
haying a silly sort of Idea that a smoke would do him good, but
the flap was open, and knife, pipe, tobacco, and matches must
have tumbled out when he got the spill. This annoyed him worse
than the pain in his throbbing head, and he wandered back to find
them. After some search he found all the articles but the
matches, and that annoyed him still more.</p>

<p>'What's the good of a pipe without matches?' he demanded, in a
querulous tone; and a voice far away in the scrub seemed to
repeat his question.</p>

<p>'I'm going? dotty,' he thought, and moved a step away. Then
he found that he had been standing oh the matchbox, which was
satisfactory, and he picked it up and went outside the scrub
again. He began to dislike the scrub. He lit his pipe and thought
of starting home, or at any rate to water, where he could rest
and bathe his head and wash his hair, which he could feel was
clotted with blood.</p>

<p>Slowly he went on reflecting what a fool he was to tackle the
blue stag and his mob by himself, on a horse not used to scrub
work. But the temptation was too great to resist, coming on them
as he did, so close to the edge of the scrub. He remembered that
he must have left his whip behind, and was almost turning back
for it, for it was a favorite one, and the dogs would get it.</p>

<p>Strange how these things worried him, and he could not
concentrate his mind upon what lay before him, namely, that there
was only one man and the jackeroo at the hut. The man had been
sent over to straighten up the horse paddock, and was no good at
anything but fencing and such work. The jackeroo was still
comparatively a green new chum whom Drummond, for his sins, had
to break in, and neither of them, in the creation of cats, could
ever track him up.</p>

<p>His only hope was that one of them would have the sense to
ride over to the head station and get one of the fellows there;
for he felt himself growing weaker and fainter as the sun
rose.</p>

<p>If he could only get to water, he'd wait till he got better,
or they found him. A black shadow suddenly flitted in front of
him, and a crow perched on a tree ahead and looked at him. Then
another joined it, and both looked at the stumbling man and gave
vent to a mirthless kind of taunting caw. He went past them, and
the pair flew on ahead again. They were following him, and he
cursed them heartily, and went doggedly on through the open
forest with his two evil-eyed followers.</p>

<p><br>
AT the hut, when it fell dark, the fencer and the new-chum
discussed his non-appearance at their evening meal. There was
nothing in it, Drummond was often late. They cleared up, and sat
down to play euchre by the murky light of a slush lamp, and
finally went to bed not feeling at all put out at his
absence.</p>

<p>In the morning they remarked that Drummond would be hungry
when he got back, and, after breakfast, the man went to his work
and the jackeroo proceeded to spoil green hide.</p>

<p>Twelve o'clock, and the missing man had not turned up. The
new-chum held a consultation with the fencer as to the
desirability of doing something; and the fencer agreed with him,
but neither could decide what the something should be.</p>

<p>Suddenly the jackeroo saw somebody approaching on the bridle
track that led to the head station, and with a sense of relief
decided that it was Drummond. The fencer, however, decided that
it was Long Jerdan, and Long Jerdan it was.</p>

<p>Long Jerdan, a tall, spare man, burnt almost black by the sun,
dismounted with the leisurely manner of his class, and shortly
demanded:</p>

<p>'Where's Dick?'</p>

<p>The jackeroo informed him of Drummond's absence. Jerdan was
taking some papers from his saddle pouch, and turned round with
them in his hand. 'Where was Dick going?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Round by the long scrub on Baxter's Creek.'</p>

<p>'What horse was he riding?'</p>

<p>'Dandy. But the horse hasn't come home,' said the
jackeroo.</p>

<p>'What should he come home for?' demanded Jerdan, with lofty
scorn. 'That's one of the yarns you get out of the story
books&mdash;the good horse that comes home and tells 'em his
rider's broke his leg. Dandy's not such a blooming Idiot.'</p>

<p>'Where would he go to?' asked the sat-upon youth.</p>

<p>'Where would you go to when you got rid of the man on your
back? Why, back to your feeding ground, and look up your mates of
course. Where does Dandy run?'</p>

<p>'On the Blue Flat?'</p>

<p>'Well, we can go there on our way, and, if we find him, we'll
know something's happened to Dick. Put the billy on, and we'll
have a feed before, we start. You've got a horse or two in the
paddock, I suppose?'</p>

<p>The fencer put the billy on to boil, and the jackeroo, feeling
greatly relieved at Jerdan's advent, went down the paddock for
the horses.</p>

<p>'There's a letter here from the boss for Drummond,' Jerdan
stated, when they were seated at the meal, 'and a paper with an
advertisement in it, asking for information concerning Richard
Wallingford Drummond, of Throwley, Devonshire, last heard of in
Western Queensland, because if he applies to some lawyers in
Melbourne he'll hear of something to his advantage. The boss
thought that Dick might be the man, and I came over to see him.
So now we've got to find him.'</p>

<p>Taking rations and blankets, the two started as soon as they
could, and rode to what was known as the Blue Flat. Sure enough,
amongst half a dozen of the station horses was Dandy, with the
saddle on his back and a bridle with broken reins on his head. He
was a quiet horse and easily caught.</p>

<p>Jerdan examined the saddle, but found no marks on it.</p>

<p>'The horse didn't come over on him, anyhow,' he said, 'but
Dick's had a nasty spill, for Dandy's easily caught. Take the
saddle and bridle off and put them up in a tree.'</p>

<p>The jackeroo did as he was told, and Jerdan commenced cutting
up a pipeful of tobacco. The jackeroo, whose name was Winter,
waited respectfully silent, for Jerdan had a reputation as an
all-round bushman, and was not to be disturbed by green hands.
Tired at last of his leisurely proceedings, Winter suggested that
they had better make a start.</p>

<p>'Right you are, my son,' returned Jerdan; 'go ahead.'</p>

<p>'Where to?' demanded Winter.</p>

<p>'Oh, I thought you knew,' said Jerdan, with bitter sarcasm.
'If you think we're going to find Dick by riding through the
country like a couple of bush missionaries with a collection list
you're out of it. I was just considering whether I had better
follow Dandy's track back or try and pick up Dick's. If Dick
got busted late in the day, It would be a deuce of a round both
to follow his and find them first, so I'll follow Dandy's track
back. Just you stop here till I sing out to you.'</p>

<p>Jerdan rode off, and Winter remained waiting until a 'cooee'
in the distance was heard; then he rode in the direction, and
found Jerdan slowly jogging along. Winter had a lesson in the art
of tracking that afternoon. Often he thought that Jerdan must
have lost the track, but, luckily, held his tongue. Twice the
silent man ahead set off and picked up pieces of the broken
reins, broken by the horse treading on them, and the sun was low
when at last they, came to a scrub-encircled lagoon, where Jerdan
motioned to Winter to pull up, while he slowly rode round the
water's edge.</p>

<p>When he had completed the circuit lie stopped and looked
grave. 'I'm afraid Dick's badly hurt,' he said as he methodically
lit his pipe.</p>

<p>'Winter looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>'You see. Dandy came straight in here and had a drink, but
Dick didn't. If he'd only had a middling bad spill he'd have
followed the horse this far; it's the only water I know of near
Baxter's Creek, for I take it the creek's as dry as a bone
now.</p>

<p>The jackeroo nodded. 'It was dry a fortnight ago when we were
out here.'</p>

<p>'If he could crawl at all he'd have come here and stopped till
somebody came; he knows I could track him up anywhere this
weather.'</p>

<p>'Do you think he's killed?' asked the youngster.</p>

<p>'I think he's pretty badly hurt. He came to grief some time in
the middle of the day, by the look of Dandy's tracks, and I'm
afraid we shan't find him to-night. Whatever it is to his
advantage, he stands a good show of never hearing it.'</p>

<p>Two crows flew up to drink, but seeing the men they perched on
a bough and regarded them with a glance of wicked
intelligence.</p>

<p>'Horse had a drink?' 'asked Jerdan.</p>

<p>Winter replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>'Then let's make the most of the light; we must camp on the
tracks to-night It's plain sailing, luckily, for Dandy would have
come, straight here without stopping to feed; likely he'd be
thirsty when He got rid of Dick.'</p>

<p>The two started on, the sun was hastening to his setting, and
the silence of the bush, and the anxious nature of their errand
dashed the spirits of the less-seasoned young man. Jerdan went
much quicker now, the horse's trail being less erratic. As the
short twilight fell, Winter thought that the grim, silent bushman
must be going, by instinct, for to his unpractised eye all traces
were invisible, but Jerdan rolled on with his eyes fixed
ahead.</p>

<p>It was getting dusk, and when they had got nearly five miles
from the lagoon, and were riding through some mulga scrub, which
made it darker. Jerdan uttered an exclamation; and stopped. He
pointed to the tracks, and in spite of the gathering gloom, even
Winter could see that a mob of cattle had been galloping
there.</p>

<p>'Dick, old man,' said Jerdan, softly, as if talking to
himself; 'I'd give the biggest cheque I've got coming to me for
just one hour more of daylight.'</p>

<p>He looked around, and rode straight to where the waning light
showed the edge of the scrub. Reaching it he said to his
companion, 'Tie your horse up, and make a fire; keep it
going.'</p>

<p>He rode off slowly, keeping in the open, skirting the scrub.
Left to himself, Winter busied himself making a fire, and by the
time it was blazing up 'the tramp of his companion's horse, and
the noise of the loud cooees he was uttering, had died away, and
a dread silence settled down.</p>

<p>How long he stood there, musing and feeling extremely lonely
and miserable, he did not know, but a low whinny from his horse
aroused him. There was an answering equine greeting, and into the
wide circle of firelight rode Jerdan. He got off his horse, and
proceeded to unsaddle.</p>

<p>'Turn your horse out, and short-hobble him,' he said, curtly.
'Don't make any tea to-night,' he said, as, having turned their
horses out, the two stood by the fire. 'You must put up with a
dry feed, we must keep all the water in our bags, 'gainst we find
Dick.'</p>

<p>He filled his never-failing pipe, and lit it with a
fire-stick, abruptly declining any food.</p>

<p>'The cattle never came out of the scrub,' he said, suddenly.
'That much I could make out. He might be lying dead anywhere
close to us. Dandy's a blundering fool in scrub.'</p>

<p>'Can't we do anything?' said Winter.</p>

<p>'We'll make a start at the first light, and we must watch our
horses, and keep them close handy to camp. That's about all we
can do. Got your pop-gun on your belt?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Winter, who sported a small revolver, although the
blacks of the district had long degenerated, into station, and
township loafers.</p>

<p>'Fire a shot, and then another one about two minutes
afterwards.'</p>

<p>Winter did so, without any result Stillness reigned all around
them. The night passed slowly; it was moonless, just a slender
crescent had shone during the twilight hours.</p>

<p>'Have you known Drummond long?' asked Winter, during their
restless watching.</p>

<p>'On and off a good few years. Dick and I have been always good
friends, although he's a born gentleman, and I'm not.'</p>

<p>'I know he's not been a stockman all his life.'</p>

<p>'Not he; his people at home are well off; but he never speaks
of them, and I never asked him.</p>

<p>'Take my advice, youngster, and when you meet a man of his
sort, never ask questions. It's the sort that are always talking
about what they've been who've come down through their own fault,
and deserve all they get.</p>

<p>'When you hear a fellow, blowing about it being a nice thing
for a man with a University education to have to pick up fleeces,
or be a wood and water joey, he's no good. Been kicked out for
some rascality. But there's another sort; they don't talk, even
when they're drunk. Good men generally; known several of them;
Dick was one.'</p>

<p>Winter was rather astonished at such a long speech from
Jerdan, who was one of the taciturn sort; but he could see that
his companion's feelings were deeply moved, and he listened,
keeping silence, while Jerdan rambled on.</p>

<p>'Yes; I've known several of 'em. Good men, as I say, like Dick
Drummond, Richard Wallingford Drummond, as it seems his full name
is. Mostly got killed. One of 'em killed by the niggers out on
the Paroo; they caught him on foot in the morning going to catch
his horse.</p>

<p>'Polished off three bucks before he caved in. Another got
taken by an alligator up the Gulf way. Went in to help a fellow,
one flood time. Fellow, a fool, would try to swim his horse
across, and came to grief. Hung on to a tree; singing out pen and
ink. Blatchett went to bring him out, alligator close under the
bank, took Blatchett and left the fool. Fool's alive now. Fools
always live; good men die, like Dick. Suppose if you'd been on
Dandy's back, you'd a come through safe.'</p>

<p>Jerdan stood up, and kicked a piece of wood into the fire,
savagely.</p>

<p>Winter chewed over the last uncomplimentary remark, and
decided that it was neither the time nor place to resent it, just
then.</p>

<p>Faintly, out of the far distance, came a noise, like the
frightened, angry cawing of crows, rudely awakened from their
dreams of dead men by some sudden disturbance of their slumbers.
Both men listened intently; once they thought they heard another,
irritable croak. Jerdan strode out of the firelight into the
darkness, and stood there watching and listening.</p>

<p>'Come here, quick!' he cried to Winter. 'Do you see a light
there, over the tree tops, under that bright star? See.'</p>

<p>He gripped Winter's arm, and forced his attention on the point
he meant. Looking steadily, the young man, after a few, seconds,
saw what certainly appeared to be the glow or reflection of a
fire. Even while, they watched, it faded and died out.</p>

<p>'Stop here, and don't take, your eyes off that star,' while I
saddle up.'</p>

<p>In an incredible short space, it seemed to Winter, Jerdan had
caught and saddled their two horses.</p>

<p>'Keep, your eye on it while I mount,' said Jerdan, 'you've not
lost it, have you?'</p>

<p>'No; that's it, under the two bright ones.'</p>

<p>'Right, I have it,' replied Jerdan, who was now in the saddle,
'follow me; we'll leave our blankets and things till the
morning.'</p>

<p>On they went, luckily through open forest country, where the
guiding star was easily kept in sight, until Jerdan stopped, and
said, 'Can't you smell burnt grass?'</p>

<p><br>
DRUMMOND went wearily along, feeling horribly sick and faint,
until with a start, he suddenly regained enough sense to wonder
where he was going. He bethought him of the scrub lagoon. That
was the nearest water, and he altered his course somewhat. But
now the sun was growing hot and he was very, faint and dizzy; he
would sit down and rest a bit.</p>

<p>The two crows still followed him, black shadows of fate, and
they perched on a neighbouring tree, and confided their opinion
to one another that he wouldn't last long.</p>

<p>Drummond lay half unconscious during the day; at times he
would make up his mind to make an effort to reach the lagoon, but
the pain in his head, and the intolerable nausea that overcame
him when he, attempted to rise made him always sink back again.
Thirst, too, began to afflict him, and occasional fits of
brain-wandering set in.</p>

<p>Towards sundown, the crows addressed a few insulting remarks
to him, and flew away for a drink. They came back before dark,
and disposed themselves for the night. The stars came out, and
with the stars and the darkness and the silence came the ghosts.
Once he made sure that he heard a distant shot, but when he tried
to shout his voice sounded like a faint whisper.</p>

<p>Out of the darkness there came to him a girl's shape. Though
he knew it was dark night, and overhead the Austral stars were
shining, he could see her plainly. Clad in her light evening
dress with the flowers of another clime nestling in her bosom, he
saw her-every feature as she came up to him, and put a chill hand
in his. The glorious eyes that he had known and loved so welt
looked into his own, with the tenderness of the true love of
old.</p>

<p>'It is cold, Dick,' she said, as he put his arm around her,
'Cold, and I have wanted you so long.'</p>

<p>He could not speak, he knew that he was lying sick and
helpless under a tree, and yet he was standing up, with the
sweetheart, who had never been his wife, in his arms once
again.</p>

<p>'Ah, Dick, it was weary, weary, after you left. Only a girl!
and they were so hard on me. Dick, Dick, you should have stayed
with me, and I would have been so strong. Dick, you never came
back when you said, and I was forced into it. So young, and all
against me. But not for long, Dick, my love; not for long, was
it? Oh; it, is cold. Dick, do you remember that summer night;
these are your roses, Dick, dear; I wear them still. Kiss me,
dear; my Dick still.'</p>

<p>Cold? Yes, it was cold; that still Australian summer night,
and the dear dead girl he held to his breast had long slept in a
quiet grave across the ocean. No. That was only a dream, a dream
that had made him a wanderer. She was here, here, and speaking to
him. No woman's voice had ever since had such music for him.</p>

<p>'Dick, my Dick, I must go now, but not for long, dear; not for
long. Ah, Dick, it is cold, hold me tight like this&mdash;like
you used to&mdash;and kiss me again.'</p>

<p>She was gone. Above the stars were pale and calm, around was
great silence, and he was lying stiff and aching under the tree.
Was she really gone? Perhaps the cold and darkness had driven
her away, for it seemed cold, though he knew that it should be
close and sultry. He would light a fire, the warmth and blaze
might bring her back.</p>

<p>Feebly, he got up; this time it was not fancy; groped about,
and found some dry sticks. Then, after a good deal of trouble, he
struck a match. The dry grass caught. Just close by a patch was
rank and long, it flared up suddenly and strongly, and the
startled crows flew out, protesting in high displeasure.</p>

<p>Drummond heard them and laughed, and as the small patch of
grass blazed, and went out, he sank down again to wait for her
coming.</p>

<p><br>
'DICK, old man; I have found you in time.'</p>

<p>It was not her voice that aroused him, nor her hand that was
holding the grateful water to his lips. No; it was his old mate
who was still talking to him. What was he saying?</p>

<p>'Dick, you must get right soon, the lawyers are advertising
for you; there is something to your advantage, they say.'</p>

<p>'Something to his advantage.' What a farce! But be had
something to do before he died. Something to her daughter's
advantage! He guessed what had happened. Yes, he would live for a
while.</p>

<p>They got him in, slowly and painfully, and he fought for life
for awhile, until his senses cleared; and he knew that the end
was near, and what he meant to do.</p>

<p>In a long interview with the superintendent, he gave him all
the needful instructions, and proof of his identity. Then he made
his will, and asked to be left with his old friend.</p>

<p>'I'm off to the main camp, Tom; I've left you something, old
man, just a little; you must take it for my sake. That's all,
'twasn't Dandy's fault; he's not used to scrub.'</p>

<p>'Another of 'em,' said Jerdan, bitterly, when all was over.
'Seems to me I'm a regular Jonah; I'll never make a friend of one
of his sort again.'</p>

<p><br>
FAR away, a girl just budding into womanhood, heard one day
that she was a wealthy heiress. But she did not hear that the
will which gave her fortune was signed by the hand of the man who
was her dead mother's only sweetheart, the mother whom she had
never known. Nor that he was a man who heard of something to his
advantage, too late&mdash;far too late.</p>

<h2><a id="ch18"></a>18. -- CAPTAIN ETIENNE DESPARD</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 11 Sep 1897</h3>

<p class="first">
TOM RICHARDS and I were lounging and smoking on our mats,
spread on the sand of No. XII Island, on the Great Barrier Beef,
at the inside entrance of the Mort Passage. The sun had gone down
behind the coast range, which there was pretty near to us, and
only a warm afterglow lingered on the sea between us and the
mainland. There were no mosquitoes. It was just the sweetest hour
of the day.</p>

<p>Richards had been devoted to the study of conchology all his
life, and he was now on a quest on the Great Barrier, backed up
by half the learned societies of Europe. He had asked me to come
with him and take charge of the lugger that, with an old Malay as
<i>serang</i>, and a couple of kanakas, conveyed us and our
fortunes over the tranquil waters of the Inner Barrier.</p>

<p>We had been anchored off No. XII for some days, as Tom had
found that portion of the reef particularly well suited to his
low-tide researches. We had made a bit of a camp ashore, and were
enjoying our ease on our island, when a cry from the lugger
aroused us.</p>

<p>Getting on our feet, we saw that the boys were all clustered
together, pointing eagerly down the passage. A sail was in sight.
The dusk was fast closing in, and the vessel, whatever it was,
had not got near enough to distinguish her before the darkness
came. She was some sort of craft drifting in with the
slow-incoming tide, and had spread some canvas to catch what
little breeze there was to give her steerage way; for the tides
in that region are of the most baffling description.</p>

<p>Where we were there would be at times but a rise and fall of
scarce eighteen inches; but immediately to the north the tide rip
swirled through the Albany Pass in whirlpools and eddies that had
ravished a spoil of anchors and chain cables. Up at Thursday
Island I had seen many a stout British-India boat have to fight
her way at full speed, foot by foot, round the point; and yet, go
past the lonely Booby Island, and on the Carpentarian shores the
lazy tide crept up amongst the mangrove flats once in the
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Tom and I pulled off to the lugger to have our evening meal,
and did not speculate much on the strange sail. It would turn up
in time.</p>

<p>In time it did turn up. As far as we could make out, she was a
well-appointed yacht, for lights gleamed from the portholes
astern and there were many more amidships. We had our riding
light up, and favored by the gusts of light wind she came towards
us and hailed. Tom answered, and the voice in somewhat broken
English asked if there was good anchorage there?</p>

<p>I replied in the affirmative, and they finally anchored about
one hundred yards from us.</p>

<p>'What in the name of all that's blue has brought that boat
through Mort's Passage?' said Tom. 'I don't believe anyone has
been through it since the day it was surveyed.'</p>

<p>'Well, they're coming off to see us,' I replied, as the
familiar sounds of a boat being lowered floated across the
water.</p>

<p>'Perhaps some foreign scientific cuss is coming to wipe your
eye on the Barrier.'</p>

<p>Tom laughed contemptuously, and presently the boat swept up to
our low gangway, where the old Malay was standing holding a
lantern. Richards and I advanced to meet the man, who stepped on
deck.</p>

<p>He was clad in spotless white, somewhat elaborately ornamented
with brass buttons and braid, and wore an ultra fashionable
yachting cap. In fact, he was, judging by his costume, more of a
stage yachtsman than a man you would expect to meet on the Great
Barrier.</p>

<p>Tom and I, in the national costume of a suit of pyjamas, felt
rather at a disadvantage when confronted with so much
magnificence.</p>

<p>'Ah!' said the stranger, whose face we could not see very
distinctly in the uncertain light; 'you are then fishers,
<i>bêche-de-mer</i>, not so?'</p>

<p>'No,' returned Tom in French, for he was an accomplished
linguist; 'we are here on scientific research.'</p>

<p>The stranger started, and taking off his cap made an elaborate
bow.</p>

<p>'Allow me to introduce myself,' he said, in a changed and
artificial kind of voice. 'I am Captain Etienne Despard, cruising
round the world in my little schooner the <i>Nymph</i>. I came
from the New Hebrides last. I adore science, and am charmed to
have come across you.'</p>

<p>Tom mentioned our names, and the adorable liar professed to
have heard of the 'famous Richards.'</p>

<p>After a little more conversation he Invited us to come on
board, and be presented to madame his wife, who was travelling
with him. We consented, saying that we would pull off in our own
boat when we had changed our clothes. This seemed to suit him
exactly, and he dropped into his boat and departed.</p>

<p>We arrayed ourselves in our only presentable garments, a
couple of white drill suits, which, however, was full dress on
the Barrier, and followed him shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>Captain Despard received us on deck and led us into the
brilliantly-lighted saloon, where a tall, dark woman, with the
remains of a beautiful face and figure, greeted us most
effusively.</p>

<p>'My wife does not speak English,' said the captain to me. 'It
is fortunate your friend speaks our language so well.'</p>

<p>A steward, with close-cropped black hair, brought in
champagne, cigars, and cigarettes, and we were soon all
comfortably chatting, Despard seemingly deeply interested in the
countries to the north of us, and gradually he drew me on to an
explanation of the shipping rules of Singapore and Hongkong,
which places he said he had never visited.</p>

<p>Time soon slipped away, and it was nearly midnight when we
roused up our sleepy kanakas to put us on board our lugger. We
had promised to come to breakfast about 10 o'clock, and early in
the morning, after a bucket or two of salt water, I was standing
looking at the <i>Nymph</i>, where all on board seemed to be
still caulking. She was a schooner-rigged yacht, built both for
comfort and speed, for she had a great show of canvas, which, by
the way, was furled in rather slovenly manner for such an
otherwise smart-looking craft. She had been recently painted, and
was trim enough; but, somehow, there was look of the commencement
of neglect about her. A yacht is nothing, unless she is well
looked after daily and never allowed to go back.</p>

<p>'That very pretty ship,' said the old <i>serang</i>, who had
come silently, barefooted, and ranged himself alongside of me.
The old fellow had knocked about at sea all his life, and spoke
very fair English. 'I seen her before,' he said, quietly.</p>

<p>'Where?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Singapore,' was the reply to my astonishment, for had not
Captain Etienne Despard assured me that he had never been to
Singapore, and was so anxious to learn all about the port
regulations. The old Malay had a very sly look about him, but he
said no more, and presently Richards appeared.</p>

<p>'What's Madame Despard like?' I asked, for he had had to do
all the running the previous night.</p>

<p>'I can't make out, old fellow. She seems a mixture. Once or
twice, when she got excited over something we were talking about,
she dropper into regular gutter slang.'</p>

<p>'I suppose she thought you wouldn't notice it.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps not; but I happen to have lived too long in France
for that.'</p>

<p>When we went on board to breakfast, I noticed the same thing
that I had observed from our lugger. A general air of untidiness
seemed to pervade the deck, and the few men visible did not move
about like real sailormen. Captain Despard looked, in his
somewhat theatrical rig, as if he might at any time burst out
with 'Shiver my timbers!' or whatever was the French equivalent
for it. The mate alone, a black-browed southerner, seemed a
sailor.</p>

<p>The breakfast was excellent, and as it was low-water, the
proposal to afterwards examine the reef, that was bare, and
obtain some unique specimens of coral, was adopted forthwith. In
spite of due adoration of science, the captain did not know
anything about either shells or coral formation, but as I did not
know much, it did not matter greatly. Richards did the amiable to
Mme. Despard, and the captain continued his inquisitorial queries
into the ways and manners of British officials.</p>

<p>We had lunch on board the lugger, although, of course, we had
only very ordinary fare to offer in return for Despard's
hospitality. That evening we went on board to dinner, and Mme.
Despard was taken ill and had to retire. In plain English, she
was drunk. I wondered that night whether this was the explanation
of the mysterious sort of cruise Despard seemed to be taking. Was
his wife a dipsomaniac whom she had to keep out of the sight of
the civilised world?</p>

<p>Next morning the captain came on board the lugger. He had a
request to make. He had ran out of medicines &mdash;for
particular kind that madame required. Would we send the lugger
into Reedport for the drugs, and eternally oblige him? I
suggested that the schooner would go quicker than the lugger, but
he was ready with an excuse.</p>

<p>When Mme. Despard was ill her case demanded the most absolute
silence, and the noise and motion of the vessel might even prove
fatal, while here it was calm and heavenly. We readily consented,
as we intended to send the lugger in anyhow in a week or
fortnight I volunteered to go with her and see that the things
were properly obtained, for under ordinary circumstances the
<i>serang</i> could do all that we wanted.</p>

<p>This proposal of mine seemed to relieve Despard immensely. It
was a fair wind, and we made arrangements for an immediate
start, and in an hour were under weigh. We had passed the
<i>Nymph</i>, when suddenly there was a hail from her deck, and I
looked round and saw a man struggling with two others; but they
immediately disappeared. All was quiet on deck, and Despard waved
a white handkerchief to us.</p>

<p>On the sandy islet I saw Richards standing unconcernedly
watching us. The whole seemed like a dream, but the old Malay who
was at the tiller had seen the struggle as well. However, it
evidently was none of our business, and as there was a beautiful,
fair wind, we kept on our course, and soon lost sight of the
schooner and No. XII. Island.</p>

<p>Despard had given me several commissions, amongst them being
the dispatch of a number of telegrams, and on our arrival at
Reedport I immediately went ashore to fulfil my mission, and
hasten our departure, for I was anxious to get back again.</p>

<p>I was well known in the place, and when I went up to the
telegraph office to send off the messages the man in change
entered into conversation with me about what had happened since I
was in last. He was looking the telegrams over as we talked, and
suddenly gave an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>'The <i>Nymph</i>!' he exclaimed. 'Why, that's the yacht,
stolen from Noumea!' He was going to show me the telegram, but
hesitated. Then he said; &mdash;</p>

<p>'How did you get this, Donaldson?'</p>

<p>'Got it from the man who has the <i>Nymph</i>, and that vessel
is now lying at No. XII. Island, where we are camped at
present.'</p>

<p>'Good lord! they are on the lookout for her everywhere. Some
escaped convicts boarded her in the harbor at night, and put to
sea with the owner and some of the crew on board. It is feared
that they would murder them when they got to sea.'</p>

<p>'I don't think they have been murdered,' I said, remembering
the hail and the struggle. I went straight to the police
magistrate and told the story. He hardly seemed to know what to
do, but finally decided to wire to Brisbane for the Government to
communicate with Noumea; and meanwhile, as the <i>Nymph</i> was
anchored in Queensland waters, he would send an inspector of
police and a policeman back with me with a warrant to detain the
vessel and crew.</p>

<p>I could not help laughing as I explained that Captain Despard,
being an escaped convict, fully committed to a deed of piracy,
would not hesitate to heave both the police officers and their
warrant overboard. But the magistrate said he could do nothing
more, and I was going away, when a happy thought struck me, and I
turned back.</p>

<p>'Wire to the Admiral in Sydney an urgent message, and I'll
wait twelve hours for the answer, anxious as I am to get
back.'</p>

<p>The magistrate still hesitated, to my disgust; but when I
suggested that it would relieve him of all responsibility, he
consented to do as I wished.</p>

<p>The answer came back sooner than I expected. The lines were
clear, and the Sydney authorities must have been better posted up
in the details of the piracy. The Admiral's message ran:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"> Communicate as soon as possible with captain
of 'Vulture,' surveying in Torres Strait, and deliver my
message.</p>

<p><br>
Than followed a message tor the captain, which, of course,
nobody but the operator saw. In five minutes we had cast loose
and were off. Luckily, the wind had changed a bit, and served us
to get back again to No. XII. Island.</p>

<p>I may as well mention here that the telegram from Despard,
that excited the clerk's attention, was addressed to a high
official in Noumea, stating that the Nymph was making for Sydney,
and was a bold attempt to throw them off the scent.</p>

<p>We went merrily all night, and by noon the next day were in
sight of No. XII.; but there was no schooner lying there. For my
part, I did not expect to find her, now I knew the truth. As we
drew near we saw a number of men&mdash;five or six at
least&mdash;at our camp on the islet; but amongst them I could
not make out Richards. It was not long before I was ashore, and
the inspector end I were immediately surrounded by an excited
crowd of jabbering maniacs.</p>

<p>At last, one man, who could speak a little English, silenced
the others and commenced his story, in a voice of suppressed
fury. They were, as I conjectured, the rightful crew of the
<i>Nymph</i>, who had been kept in close confinement below, as
their dirty and dishevelled appearance testified, and had now
been put ashore on the islet as soon as I had disappeared with
the lugger.</p>

<p>But where was Richards?</p>

<p>I asked for the captain, and the man who had been speaking,
who was certainly the dirtiest of the lot, exclaimed: 'If I,
monsieur, if you can believe me, am captain&mdash;Etienne
Despard, the owner of the <i>Nymph</i>.'</p>

<p>Then his passion fairly overcame him, and he raved and swore
against the damnable villain who had robbed him of his yacht and
his name, who was wearing his clothes and drinking his wine, and
he wound up with stating that his unhappy wife was at Noumea
uncertain as to whether he was dead or alive.</p>

<p>I ventured to congratulate him on the fact that his wife was
on shore when the vessel was seized; but this did not seem to
comfort him much. The idea of 'that cursed Lorette' wearing his
wife's clothes, and the other strutting about in his yachting
uniforms, seemed to me the bitterest part of the Wow.</p>

<p>Still, I could obtain no tidings of Richards. None of the man
on the islet had seen anyone answering to his description on
board the <i>Nymph</i> when they were hustled ashore. I could not
make it out at all. Richards would not have gone with the pirate
of his own accord, but he certainly was gone.</p>

<p>Suddenly it flashed on me that he had been kidnapped to act as
interpreter.</p>

<p>That was the solution, and I did not think any actual harm
would come to him, for he was a long-headed fellow. I inquired
about the struggle we had seen, and was told that the hatch had
been taken off too soon, while we were still in sight, and one of
the men had made a rush on deck and hailed us.</p>

<p>Now, the one thing to be done was to up stick and find H.M.S.
<i>Vulture</i>. The smoke of a northern-bound steamer was in
sight, and if we could get in her track and speak her when she
overhauled us, she would take the news to Thursday Island, and
perhaps the <i>Vulture</i> was in there.</p>

<p>The tank at our camp was full of water, so after landing some
rations for the men we started; taking the real Captain Despard
with us. We spoke the steamer, a China-bound E. and A. boat, and
then cracked on all we could, with our eyes skinned for the
<i>Vulture</i>, for a survey vessel looking for uncharted rocks
might be picked up anywhere.</p>

<p>We actually reached Thursday Island at the same time the
<i>Vulture</i> did. The steamer had taken the news, and a
pearling boat who had sighted the <i>Vulture</i> went out to her.
The telegram was delivered, and Captain Despard, the two police
officials, and myself were transhipped, and a start made at once,
everybody on board rejoicing at this pleasant break in the
monotony of survey work.</p>

<p>For my part, I was made very comfortable, and thoroughly
enjoyed the chase. Even the unfortunate Despard somewhat
recovered his spirits with a new suit of clothes. We first
visited all the pearling stations, and from one heard that they
had sighted a strange schooner three or four days ago. They
judged she was making for Samarai or Sudest.</p>

<p>'We Shall catch him,' said the captain, gleefully. 'He intends
to snake round the north of New Guinea to the Philippines, and he
daren't land at a German settlement; they'd suspect him at
once.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps he's made for Guam,' I suggested, as a mild joke.</p>

<p>But the captain took it seriously, and replied that if he'd
made for the Carolines we would probably get the schooner, if he
didn't purposely wreck her, but not the men.</p>

<p>The suggestion of wrecking was not a pleasant one, feeling
certain, as I did, that Richards was detained on board the chase.
Fortunately, the <i>Vulture</i> had coaled at Thursday island,
and we were able to lay ourselves out for a long trip; but we had
to be careful not to over-run our quarry.</p>

<p>The officers went at it methodically, and laid off an
imaginary course for the schooner every day, according to the
prevailing winds, and on this imaginary chart, we were drawing
very close together. At last our doubts were changed into
certainties.</p>

<p>A Dutch gunboat had sighted a schooner flying no flag only the
day before. She had signalled her, and received no answer, and
the captain's suspicions being aroused, she had steamed towards
her, when they had hoisted the French tricolor, on which they let
her go. For doing so our captain thanked them heartily, but not
audibly. No man likes his game taken from him.</p>

<p>We were then about a day's steam to the eastward of the
Moluccas, where we hoped to run her down, and everybody went
about shaking hands with himself on the accuracy of his judgment.
We now easily tracked her up the coast, and through the Morotai
Straits, for there were plenty of native vessels, and an
occasional tramp steamer to be met with.</p>

<p>Then we heard of her making south, and Captain Ambler, of
H.M.S. <i>Vulture</i>, said to the bereaved Captain, Despard, 'I
shall have the pleasure of handing your schooner over to you at
Ternate,' and to Ternate we straight-way steamed.</p>

<p>It was sunrise when we entered that most beautiful harbor,
with its sheltering ring of volcanic, peaks, Tidor and Ternate,
and the splintered crests of the more distant Halmahera
mountains. It is a free port, and you come and go as you
like.</p>

<p>There, at anchor, lay the taut little schooner; the chase was
over, and the quarry run down.</p>

<p>'O brigand thief, pig, pirate, robber, I have got you at
last,' yelled Despard, shaking his fist at the silent deck of the
yacht.</p>

<p>In a short time a boat's crew put the second lieutenant,
myself, and Despard on board the schooner. A solitary figure
advanced to meet us. It was Richards, looking just as usual, and
as though being forcibly abducted was a matter of every-day
occurrence.</p>

<p>'They are all gone,' he said, as he shook hands with me,
'excepting two in there, and they had to stop, for there was a
bit of trouble last night after we came to anchor.'</p>

<p>We followed Tom into the saloon, and there lay the dead bodies
of the unfortunate woman and the sham Captain Despard.</p>

<p>'How did it come about?' asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>'Oh, when they were getting ready to clear out from the
vessel, the miserable woman was helplessly drunk; then all the
devil, which, to give him his due, he had hitherto kept pretty
well under, came out in the man, and he flew on the unconscious
wretch, and commenced to beat her unmercifully. I interfered,
but, it seems, too late, and knocked him down. He got up and came
at me with a knife, so I shot him in self defence, but I only
intended to cripple him. However, he gave me no time, and got it
through the heart. The others did not trouble, but left with all
they could lay hands on. You'll never get them, and I'm not
sorry, for that mate was a very decent fellow, and no end of a
sailor. He navigated the yacht right through. I'm glad you
fellows have come, for I was just going ashore to find out if
there was such a thing as a consul here.'</p>

<p>Despard was looking at his dead enemy. 'He'd put on my best
coat to go ashore in,' he said. Then he proceeded coolly to strip
the bloodstained garment off the corpse.</p>

<p>It was just as I thought. Richards had been trapped on board,
and confined in the saloon till the yacht started. He was wanted
for his knowledge of the archipelago, and his ability to speak
Dutch and Spanish. It was he who advised them to make for
Ternate, instead of going to the Philippines. They did not treat
him badly; very well, in fact. The one drawback was that the
woman would keep getting drunk, and making love to him.</p>

<p>He had luckily taken the precaution at an early period of the
voyage to secrete a revolver, and always carry it. I do not know
whether there were any legal formalities gone through; I think
not. Captain Ambler put a midshipman and four men on the schooner
to sail her down to Thursday Island, and we parted from Captain
Despard for the time being.</p>

<p>At Thursday Island we picked up our lugger, and returned to
No. XII., and when the <i>Nymph</i> arrived and took the men off,
Richards went back to his shells and coral and photographs, and I
suppose H.M.S. <i>Vulture</i> went looking for uncharted rocks as
usual; and the little episode became only a memory, except to the
escaped convicts, who I presume got away from Ternate by degrees,
and probably drifted into the hands of the police again.</p>

<p>Once I was reminded of it. A friend from Singapore told me
that he saw the <i>Nymph</i> there, and with some others went on
board to dinner. Then, after dinner, Captain Despard told an
elaborate and altogether mendacious version of the recapture of
the <i>Nymph</i>, and going to his cabin, shortly came back, with
a frogged and brass-buttoned coat on.</p>

<p>'Here,' he said, pointing to a bullet hole in the breast,
carefully left unmended, 'is where the pirate's bullet struck me,
as I sprang to victory, on my own deck!'</p>

THE two men pulled up on the bank of a small creek or gully
running between barren, stony ridges. The heat was intense; the
sun, almost vertical, glared through the scanty motionless leaves
of the gnarled and stunted trees, affording scarce a square foot
of shade. The dull red haze of tropical Australia overspread
everything like the looming smoke of a distant bush fire, and
though only a few low-lying clouds were visible, every now and
then came the mattered growl of faraway thunder.</p>

<p>"Shall we go any further or turn back?" said one of the two
prospectors on the Ord River in the days of the Kimberley
rush.</p>

<p>"I vote we try this gully first," said the other, a
grey-bearded man. "It looks likely enough; and if that
thunderstorm comes up we might get show enough to camp here for a
bit."</p>

<p>The younger man dismounted and commenced to unsaddle, as did
his companion. The horses were hobbled out, and the quarts filled
from the water bags and put on to boil. The two men stood idly
watching them.</p>

<p>"I wonder which way Moulton went?" remarked one.</p>

<p>"He didn't come this way, at any rate, or we'd have seen
something of his tracks."</p>

<p>"Three weeks at least since he left."</p>

<p>"What's that noise?" said Gibson, the older man, as he stooped
to put the tea in the quart pots. Both listened.</p>

<p>"What did it sound like?" asked Panton, the younger man.</p>

<p>"Something like a horse, away up the gully."</p>

<p>"One of these big wallaroos, I expect; they make a deuce of a
noise in this stony country."</p>

<p>"Very likely," said Gibson, and they commenced their meal.</p>

<p>When finished, the two men started fossicking in the bed of
the gully and kept it up for about two hours, without much
success, when suddenly the noise they had heard before sounded
again much closer and more distinctly.</p>

<p>Both men stood listening, revolver in hand, for out there
anything was a possible enemy. The noise approached, and round
the bend came a horse in hobbles, picking his way down the rocky
bed of the gully. He raised his head when he saw the men and gave
a whinny of delight, then came clattering up to them.</p>

<p>"Where the deuce did yon come from?" remarked Gibson. "You've
been through bad times, anyhow."</p>

<p>He certainly did look as though he had been through bad times;
his eyes were wild and staring, his flanks tucked up with thirst,
and his feet cut with the hobbles. But he had a game head, with a
never-say-die look about it that showed his pluck that had
evidently stuck by him in his struggle through the desert.</p>

<p>"He has come a long way; look how bright the bobble chain is,"
said Pantos, as he stooped to take them off. Gibson filled the
prospecting dish from the pack water-bag, and the stranger
swallowed it in one or two mighty swallows. Another and another
followed, and their visitor, who seemed mighty glad to see men
once again, whinnied gratefully for more.</p>

<p>"Why, hang me if I' don't believe it's one of Moulton's
horses," said Panton, who had been regarding the steed curiously.
"We must follow his tracks back anyhow," said Gibson, "Let's
saddle up and get back to camp." They proceeded to do so, the
newcomer following them freely.</p>

<p><br>
NEXT morning, the stranger for obvious reasons not being able
to give any clue to his late owners, they started to follow his
tracks back. For the first ten miles it led them through broken
country, mostly covered with spinifex. About two hours before
sundown they emerged on the edge of a plateau, from which they
had an extensive view to the southward and westward. At their
feet a broad valley ran as far as they could see, widening out
into flats and basins as it proceeded. Down the middle they could
trace the course of a broad river or creek, evidently of some
size, from its dark line of foliage. No sign of life was to be
seen; no smoke arose from burning country to indicate the
presence of natives; utter solitude seemed to reign over all.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose there's any water there," said Gibson, "or
that horse would not have come on in hobbles."</p>

<p>They descended by a rough spur, blasted by a bush fire some
weeks before, and rode straight for the river they had sighted.
When they reached it they found the track of the horse came from
up the river. The bed was broad and sandy, but dry; there were
marks of heavy floods, but it did not look like a creek to hold
water long. That night they came to a salt pool that the hobbled
horse had been pawing round in disgust. By digging they got a
little brackish water that did for the horses, so they camped.
Next moaning they kept on up the river, hourly expecting to find
something. It was evident they must be near the camp the horse
had left, for he could not have travelled much further in hobbles
without water.</p>

<p>Some crows appeared, and after the uncanny fashion of these
birds kept flying from tree to tree, sometimes ahead and
sometimes behind, keeping up their mournful croak all the while.
The creek now neared a gloomy gorge. There was a little grass on
the made soil of the banks, but beyond the ranges were covered
with spinifex.</p>

<p>Just before reaching the gorge they came upon more horse
tracks, and then, in the distance, they saw the white gleam of a
tent.</p>

<p>But all was still and silent; only some more crows flew up and
sainted them. The ashes of the dead camp fire were whitening in
the sun, and by it lay the body of a man, and from the doorway of
the tent projected the feet of another. Both men dismounted in
silence, and looked around for spears or other weapons, for their
thoughts naturally turned to the natives, but there were no signs
of blacks visible. After examining the body at the fire they
turned to the man in the tent.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Moulton, the man who left a month before we did."
said Panton.</p>

<p>"This is no niggers' work," answered Gibson. The man by the
fire had been shot in two places, the man in the tent had been
stabbed, and the man who was shot still held in his hand the
sheath knife that had evidently done the deed.</p>

<p>"This man," said Panton, indicating the one outside the tent,
"stabbed Moulton, and Moulton got to the tent and got his
revolver and shot him But what was the quarrel about?"</p>

<p>"I've known men quarrel and part company before now, but never
dreamt that men would murder each other in such a place as this,"
and he looked round at the desolate solitude that encircled
them.</p>

<p>"Do you know the other man?" he wont on. Panton looked at the
face which still bore sufficient likeness to humanity to be
recognisable.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered slowly, "I think it's a fellow who used to
be knocking about Wyndham when I was there&mdash;a handsome
fellow, who had rather a bad name. Moulton's wife was in Wyndham;
do you know her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've seen her, a good-looking devil. Poor Moulton was
devoted to her, but she&mdash;well, I think she hated him."</p>

<p>"And this fellow was always hanging about Moulton's place? By
Jove, I begin to see light."</p>

<p>"I it's search the camp. Perhaps they found gold and
quarrelled over it."</p>

<p>They made a close investigation, but nothing was discovered to
indicate that the dead prospectors had struck anything. They
found a damp impression in the river, which, on scraping the
sand, revealed a good supply of fresh water. The horses must have
filled this up pawing and trampling in the sand after the deaths
of their masters, and being unable to get a drink, had started
off to look for water.</p>

<p>"If we could make the horses speak perhaps we should find
something out," said Gibeon.</p>

<p>"If Mrs Moulton chooses to speak I think we may find out
something," replied Panton. "I believe that woman is at the
bottom of it."</p>

<p>"D&mdash;m it!" cried Gibson, suddenly. "What's the meaning
of this&mdash;there's only one riding saddle in the camp, and no
rations worth speaking of."</p>

<p>"We must find the other horses. They must have gone up the
river."</p>

<p>They covered the bodies over and started through the gorge.
The tracks of five or six horses were visible going through.
Above they found the river ran through an open basin of good
grassy country, and there was a good hole of water. The horses
had stayed there, and, as they had anticipated, were packed, and
one had a riding saddle on. Two of them had got rid of their
loads, which were scattered about; but one pack was intact, and
the riding horse had only succeeded in robbing his bridle off.
Gibson pointed out the revolver strapped over the knee pad of the
saddle&mdash;a custom common with some men.</p>

<p>"It's as plain as print," he said. "Moulton was out
prospecting, and this fellow packed up and was going to leave
him. Moulton came back sooner than he thought for. Being on foot,
he was in camp before the other knew of it. Then came the
quarrel, and that's why the murderer used his knife&mdash;he
couldn't get at the revolver on his saddle."</p>

<p>"That's it, sure enough," said Panton. "I bet it was a made-up
thing with that woman, too. I suppose he didn't want to kill
Moulton himself, and thought he could do it just as surely if he
left him up here on foot without rations."</p>

<p>"So it would have been hardly possible that he could ever torn
up again; however, this man only came off second best."</p>

<p>They drove the horses back to the camp where the death fight
had occurred, and turning out, prepared to bury the bodies.</p>

<p>"We'll give poor Moulton as decent a grave as we can," said
Gibson; "but that other beggar&mdash;for two pins, I'd leave him
to rot above ground."</p>

<p>"He's dead," said Panton, simply.</p>

<p>They dug the two graves far apart, and spent the rest of
daylight cutting Moulton's initials in a tree at his head, to
show that a white man was buried there; but over the other they
made neither mark nor sign.</p>

<p>"One thing I can't make out," said Panton that night as they
were talking over the affair. "What made that horse turn off from
the river and make over the range. It was a very unusual thing to
do."</p>

<p>"Yes; and why was he hobbled, and not loose with the others
ready to start?"</p>

<p>"He might have been away that morning, and that fellow
reckoned to pick him up as he went along; but as to what made a
thirsty horse leave a watercourse he was following and make over
a dry range is more than I can explain; never heard of such a
thing before."</p>

<p>"He came to tell us about it, I expect." The next morning they
packed up and left the ill-omened camp to its original grim
solitude.</p>

<p>"This saddle that was in camp has Moulton's initials branded
on it; so that's more evidence to support what we think," said
Panton. They commenced their homeward journey, and when at the
place where the track of the hobbled horse left the river
examined it well, but found no explanation of the strange
fact.</p>

<p>"That's a part of the book we can't read like the rest," said
Gibson.</p>

<p>"There's another part yet that we shan't read," replied
Panton, "and that's Mrs Mouton."</p>

<p>"I'll leave that job to yon when we go down," returned
Gibson.</p>

<p><br>
IT was six months after the discovery that Gibson and Panton
returned to Wyndham on their way to the south. They had been
lucky, and were going down for a spell. The finding of the bodies
had been reported to the police, and the horses and outfit
delivered over to them, by whom they were sold, and the proceeds
handed to the widow, who, report said, had gone back to her
friends in New South Wales.</p>

<p>Strange to say, at the same hotel in Sydney where the friends
put up a newly-wedded pair were staying, who attracted soma
attention, from the fact that the bride was some years older than
the bridegroom with more money than wits. The bride had been a
handsome widow of the name of Moulton. She took an opportunity of
meeting and speaking to Panton privately, though she had openly
showed that she did not wish to be recognised.</p>

<p>"Mr Panton, you and your friend, I believe, found the body of
my late husband and the man who accompanied him on his
prospecting trip. I suppose that the blacks were punished for the
murder afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Blacks? No; the blacks had nothing to do with it. They had
not been near the place where we found them for months."</p>

<p>"Oh! but really, Mr Panton, it could have been no one else, I
heard the foolish story that got about; but there could have been
no quarrel between poor Jim and the other man, Jim had nothing of
value upon him."</p>

<p>"I assure you that the blacks are innocent. Your husband and
the other man killed each other. It was a case of attempted
murder on the part of the other man. That I am as positive of as
if I had seen it take place."</p>

<p>"What a romantic story, but bow improbable. No; I am as well
convinced of the matter on my part as if I had seen it occur. My
poor Jim had nothing to be robbed of, and there was no possible
cause of quarrel beside."</p>

<p>"None?"</p>

<p>"None. I am afraid you and your friend are not very good
bushmen, Mr Panton, and missed the blacks' tracks. Believe me,
the natives were to blame," and she smiled somewhat
superciliously and left him.</p>

<h2><a id="ch20"></a>20. -- A MESSAGE FROM THE DESERT</h2>

<h3><i>Adelaide Observer</i>, 24, 31 March 1894</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
SUNRISE on the western plains of Queensland during the
tropical summer-time has a peculiar character of its own.
Probably the night has been calm and sultry; but as the hour of
daylight approaches, light puffs of warm wind come soughing
across the almost treeless expanse. There is no hesitation about
the dawn, no long, lingering half-light. A streak of gray
brightens in the east, widening quickly, and turning a soft, rosy
pink; it blots out all the host of stars of lesser magnitude.
Soon, none save the brightest are visible. The brilliant
triple-jewelled belt of Orion, most perfect of all
constellations; the Cross of the South lying horizontally near
the earth, with the two steadfast pointers above; and, glorious
over all, in pure, lustrous splendour, the Star of the Morning,
surrounded with the opal tints of the fast-brightening eastern
sky.</p>

<p>The far-stretching plain seems now to bound into sudden
distinctiveness of detail, and on the horizon a tremulous
shimmering is visible, foretelling another day of heat. The sun's
upper limb appears large, red, and glowing, and all the stars die
out. Angrily it looms through the quivering haze, mounts until
three parts of the disc is visible, then, seemingly, gives a
sudden bound of two or three degrees above the horizon, and day
has commenced.</p>

<p>A summer's day in December! For twelve unclouded hours the orb
of fire will relentlessly blast, and scorch, and wither all the
surviving vegetation that the past months have spared. Soon the
cattle who have been feeding out in the open country during the
night time will come slowly stringing along in single file to
seek the shelter of the trees that fringe the banks of the river.
Here, in such scanty shade as the vertical sun allows the thinly
foliaged trees to afford, they will ruminate all day until the
cooler hours of night again tempt them forth to feed.</p>

<p>The river is no rushing, babbling stream; for the most part
the bed is dry, sandy, or shingly, the water-holes being often
miles apart. For the three months of the wet season it is a deep
uncrossable torrent; for the remaining nine, a string of isolated
pools.</p>

<p>On the bank of such a river, opposite the end of one of these
pools, two men are saddling their horses. There has been a
prolonged drought, and what little grass remains looks dry and
white; the horses show signs of having been ridden hard the day
before, and are pinched about the flanks, as if they had not made
a satisfactory meal during the night.</p>

<p>The tire, beside which the men have slept, is still
smouldering, and their tin quart pots full of tea are standing
near it. The saddles put on, the two men hitch their bridles on
to a neighbouring sapling, and sit down to discuss a primitive
breakfast of salt beef and bread, washed down with tea sweetened
with coarse brown sugar. Both are dressed in collarless Crimean
shirts, moleskin trousers, and leggings; both wear the soft felt
hat that has superseded the once typical cabbage-tree, and carry
revolvers in their belts, for it is the early days of the
seventies, and this is a newly settled pioneer cattle station,
and as yet the natives are still dangerous. Although one is the
owner of the station, and the other his stockman, no distinction
is visible either in dress or appearance. They have been on a
long excursion down the river after some truant stock, and have
camped for the night to recruit their tired horses.</p>

<p>Their hasty meal finished, they are about to mount and start,
when a noise on the opposite side of the river attracts their
attention. A man, on foot, comes limping painfully down the bank,
and on reaching the water's edge, throws himself down on the
sand, and plunging his face in the pool, drinks thirstily and
greedily.</p>

<p>"Who can that be?" mutters the elder of the two men, for the
apparition is unexpected. They silently watch the newcomer until
he lifts his head after his deep draught; then one of them shouts
to him. The stranger has been too eager to attain the life-saving
water to notice them; but at the sound of the voice he now starts
and looks up, then eagerly waving his hand, commences to cross
the dry bed of the river. When he reaches the bank, he wearily
surmounts it, and throws himself down with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"You seem to have had a bad time of it," says the man who had
spoken before. "Better put a quart on, Jim," he goes on, nodding
to his companion, who puts the fire together, unbuckles the
quart-pot hanging by a short strap from his saddle, and goes down
the bank to fill it.</p>

<p>The tired man recovers himself somewhat, and answers
faintly&mdash;"Yes; I am just about done."</p>

<p>He certainly looks it. His sun-scorched face and arms are lean
and gaunt with famine; his eyes are still bright and feverish
with thirst; and his belt is drawn tightly round his pinched
waist. In his hand he still holds a canvas water-bag, the dry
collapsed Bides of which evince that it is long since it has held
water. Above all he has, in his fixed gaze and nervous manner,
the indescribable appearance that besets a man after a long,
solitary struggle for life.</p>

<p>"Where have you sprung from?" says his interrogator, after a
pause, during which Jim, who has returned, places the quart-pot
on the rekindled fire, and produces what remnants of their meal
arc left.</p>

<p>"I started out six months ago with the Pattens, the two
brothers, to look for new country; there were four of us,
accounting the blackboy."</p>

<p>"Your name is Burgess, then, I suppose? We imagined you must
have made in for the Overland Telegraph Line, as you were so long
away."</p>

<p>"We should have done better if we had," returned the stranger;
"as it is, I am the only one left."</p>

<p>"Is it possible? How did you come to grief?"</p>

<p>"We lost a number of our horses on a patch of poison plant
country&mdash;that was the first misfortune. Then no rain fell
all the time we were away; and coming back, we got on to a dry
stage, and found that the water-hole we had depended on had been
dry for weeks. The elder Patten and all the remainder of the
horses died of thirst; but the younger one, the black boy, and I,
managed to reach water in the Herbert River. There, the blacks
got on to us; and as we had abandoned nearly all our ammunition,
we had no show at all. The boy was killed, and young Patten so
badly wounded that he died two days afterwards. That was more
than a fortnight ago, and I have been crawling on ever
since."</p>

<p>"How far did you manage to get out?"</p>

<p>"Along way across the South Australian border. It was coming
back all the trouble overtook us."</p>

<p>By this time the quart pot was boiling, the tea made; and the
famished man attacked the food voraciously.</p>

<p>"It is ten good miles to the station," said Hopwood, the
owner. "Supposing you rest here, and I will send a man and a
spare horse down for you to ride up."</p>

<p>The other nodded a weary assent.</p>

<p>"Leave me your pipe and some tobacco," he said, "and I shall
be all right."</p>

<p>The two men mounted and rode away; and the rescued man, after
lighting the pipe with an ember from the fire, lay under the
shade of a tree enjoying the welcome luxury. His smoke finished,
he rose, and looked around on the lifeless plain. No living
object was visible. Putting his hand in the bosom of his shirt he
drew forth some folded papers and a small note-book; then seating
himself in the best available shade, with his back against a
tree, he commenced to write in the note-book with the small
leaden pencil appertaining to it. He wrote slowly, like a man
unaccustomed to use a pen much, and it was more than an hour
before his task was completed; then he leaned back against the
tree, lost in thought.</p>

<p>The place where he was had evidently on many occasions been
used for camping purposes. Several empty tins that had formerly
contained preserved meals or fish were lying about. Rising, he
picked up an empty salmon tin, and, after tearing a blank sheet
out of the notebook, placed the book and the other papers inside.
Next he scraped the ashes of the fire away, and on the site it
had occupied dug a small bole with a stick in the sandy soil. In
this hole he placed the tin with the papers, and, having filled
it up again, rekindled the fire over the place, thus hiding all
traced of what he had done. He looked carefully at the different
trees, many of which were marked with initials rudely cut with
knives or tomahawks. These he noted down on the blank sheet he
had retained, then stepped the number of paces from the fire to
the nearest tree and put that down. He folded the paper up and
put it in his trouser pocket, threw the tiny pencil on the fire,
and laid himself down once more under the tree to await the
coming relief.</p>

<p>All the time he had been occupied, his face had worn a
nervous, suspicious look; and several times he had glanced
stealthily, around, as though even in that solitude he feared
that he was watched. This look left his face as he threw the
pencil in the fire, and he quickly fell into a profound,
untroubled sleep.</p>

<p>He was a young man, with a simple, honest face, though
somewhat undecided and weak&mdash;a man who gave you the idea
that while he had plenty of physical courage and tenacity, he
could be dominated by a stronger will and intellect.</p>

<p>About the middle of the afternoon, Jim Turner, the stockman,
appeared, leading a spare horse; and the pair were soon on their
way to the station.</p>

<p>The homestead, called Bendabar, which they reached just before
dark, consisted of a couple of huts with mud walls and thatched
roofs and verandahs; and a rude stockyard and milking-yard.</p>

<p>Burgess was made as comfortable as circumstances permitted,
and in a week or two had fairly recovered from his privations,
and was well enough to travel east to Rockhampton and take
steamer to the southern colony where his home was.</p>

<p>The story he retold with more detail was substantially the
same as that he first related to Hopwood. Naturally, it found its
way into the principal Australian newspapers; and after exciting
the usual comment, died a natural death.</p>

<p>Hopwood received one letter from Burgess, notifying his safe
arrival, returning the money advanced for his expenses, and
thanking him for the assistance rendered.</p>

<p><br>
TEN years have passed, and the cattle station that was is now
a well-known sheep station; a comfortable house and all the
necessary outbuildings have long replaced the primitive mud huts,
and miles of wire fencing radiate in all directions. The wave of
settlement has swept on to the westward for hundreds of miles,
and the solitude that witnessed the fate of the Pattens has been
stocked and settled.</p>

<p>Only one evidence of the tragedy has come to light. The bones
of the horses that perished on the poison patch have been found;
but no trace of human remains has been forthcoming. Bendabar,
where Burgess arrived, had been sold and resold since that event,
and the occupants had changed several times, so that the story of
the man's rescue was now only a hearsay tradition.</p>

<p>One evening a stranger rode up to the homestead and requested
an interview with the Manager. After presenting a letter of
introduction from the firm that owned the station, he briefly
stated his business. His name was Patten; he was a younger
brother of the men who had perished ten years before; he had
lately received a letter from Burgess, not long dead, which
letter was only to be forwarded after Burgess's death, informing
Patten that the writer had buried certain papers on the spot
where Hopwood bad picked him up, giving him marks and indications
how to find the place, and winding up with a mysterious
intimation that Fatten did not just then specify.</p>

<p>"Can you show me the place, Mr. Owen?" said the visitor in
conclusion.</p>

<p>"I know the place, roughly speaking," replied the Manager. "It
still goes by the name of  Burgess's Relief;' but without
Hopwood or Turner it would be hard to find the exact spot. The
last big flood altered the position of the waterholes a good
deal."</p>

<p>"Burgess says in his letter that it had been often used for a
camping ground, and that several of the trees round about were
marked with initials, of which he encloses a list."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately for your purpose, we have used a good deal of
timber from that part, and ten to one these marked trees have
been out down. However, I will drive you down to-morrow morning,
and we will have a look."</p>

<p>Early the following day Owen and his guest drove down to the
place.</p>

<p>"This," said the Manager as they pulled up, "is the place
known as Burgess's Relief; but the exact spot I cannot indicate.
This used to be the end of the waterhole, so I should say it was
somewhere about here. As you can see, the water now extends
nearly half a mile farther."</p>

<p>Patten took out a piece of paper from his pocket, and
read:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
Five paces up the river from a gumtree much marked; the
initials A.F.H. over J.L. facing 'the plant." Another gumtree
farther down, with R.O. and M.H. marked on it; and up the river
a coolabah-tree with a cross on it.</p>

<br>

<p>"We had better turn the horses out and have a systematic
search," said Owen. "That coolabah-tree is the best clue, as it
is not likely to have been cut down."</p>

<p>The horses were unharnessed and hobbled out, and the two men
went opposite wars up and down the river, examining all the
trees. They returned, and exchanged reports of their ill
success.</p>

<p>"Without either Hopwood or Jim Turner, I am afraid I have not
much chance," remarked Patten.</p>

<p>"Did you make any enquiries about them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as I came here. Hopwood is in New Zealand. Turner was
last heard of three years ago, going out to the Northern
Territory with a mob of travelling cattle."</p>

<p>"Advertise in the leading papers."</p>

<p>"That will he the best, I think, and quickest."</p>

<p>"How were the things buried?"</p>

<p>"In an old salmon tin; and that reminds me that Burgess said
there were many lying about."</p>

<p>"There are any amount of empty tins lying about now, for the
splitters have camped up and down this bank. What was his reason
for burying the papers?"</p>

<p>"That I am not at liberty to relate; but" &mdash;Patten went
on, as if to make up for the abruptness of this answer; "I may as
well tell you that the two relatives of mine who were lost were
only half-brothers, although I find they were regarded as
brothers here. The youngest was my elder, and my own brother; the
other, was six years the senior, was our half-brother."</p>

<p>Whether it was fancy or not, Owen could not decide, but he
imagined there was a certain ring of dislike in his companion's
voice as he spoke of this half-brother.</p>

<p>They caught and harnessed up the horses, and were about
starting, when Patten said suddenly, and as though he had been
thinking the matter over, "I may as well trust you, if I ask you
to keep it to yourself. I must find those papers, for I have
reason to suspect foul play, and the truth lies in them."</p>

<p>"The truth of what?" said Owen, in surprise.</p>

<p>"How my brother died," returned Patten.</p>

<p>"Did Burgess murder him?"</p>

<p>"No; but he knew who did. He told some of the truth, but not
all the truth; my brother's wounds were not inflicted by the
natives."</p>

<p>"But if Burgess did not do it, who did? Your half-brother died
of thirst beforehand."</p>

<p>"Did he?" said Fatten, as he stepped into the buggy. "I have a
strong belief that he is as much alive as you and I are now."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
THE Pattens came of a squatting family. The father had been
the owner of a compact and paying sheep station in the south-west
of New South Wales. He died shortly after the death of his two
sons in Queensland; and the youngest son, who had lately visited
Bendabar, now held possession of the property, owning a
half-share, and managing for his mother and two younger sisters
who inherited the other half.</p>

<p>It was some three months after his northern visit, and he sat
in the small verandah room that did duty as an office, regarding
a letter he had just received from New Zealand. The letter was
from Hopwood, in reply to one from Patten, Hopwood having
forwarded his address on seeing the advertisement that bad been
inserted. The writer described the position of the place to the
beat of his memory, but candidly stated that, after such a lapse
of time, and the alteration entailed by cutting the timber, and
the effect of the flood, he did not suppose he could do more than
go approximately near the spot, even if he visited the
locality.</p>

<p>From Jim Turner there had been no response; and Patten moodily
thought that his only plan would be to go back and turn up about
half a mile of the bank; and even then, with the utmost care,
such a small article as a salmon tin might easily be missed.</p>

<p>The whole affair had an atmosphere of mystery about it that
was depressing. In the first place, Burgess, when he returned,
had managed to evade a personal interview. Both Patten and his
father had been naturally anxious to see him, and hear from his
own lips the account of the tragedy; but although Burgess had
written several letters, he always managed to miss any
appointments, and finally disappeared without leaving any
address. Young Patten was then bent upon going up to Queensland
and personally searching for the remains; but his father was
breaking up&mdash;he could not be spared from the station; and so
he had perforce to remain until it was too late to do any
good.</p>

<p>The years rolled on, and he had almost forgotten the fancies
that had troubled him when he first heard of the catastrophe. He
and his half-brother, who was the only child of the first wife,
had always mutually disliked each other, and Robert Patten, the
younger, had strongly objected to his brother's going on the
trip. The eldest son had always been of a morose, passionate
nature, and had systematically bullied his young half brothers
until they were old enough to resent it. This the youngest one
did more than his brother, who was of a quieter disposition. In
consequence, it was with rather a prejudiced mind that Robert now
turned over the various circumstances that had lately cropped up
concerning the deaths in the west of Queensland.</p>

<p>In the first place, he had met an old friend, who said to him,
"By the way, I always understood that your eldest brother died in
the bush in Queensland."</p>

<p>"So he did, I am sorry to say."</p>

<p>"Well, I saw either him or his ghost in Adelaide about two
years ago."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man&mdash;a case of mistaken identity."</p>

<p>"It is you who are talking nonsense, my boy. Why, I know your
brother AIf Patten better than I do you."</p>

<p>"Did you speak to him?"</p>

<p>"No. In fact, to tell you the truth, he seemed to avoid
me."</p>

<p>"It must have been a ghost, then. If it had been my brother,
why should he have avoided you, and why has he not come
home?"</p>

<p>"Well, it was a wonderful likeness. I was on my way home to
England at the time; and I certainly told several people on
board, who knew him and had heard of his death, about it."</p>

<p>Patten was naturally disturbed by such a piece of information.
If his brother was alive, he owned the whole of the station, and
all the property left by his father, for the will, made shortly
before his father's death, only left it between his mother,
sisters, and himself, contingent upon the deaths of his two
brothers being confirmed; for, owing to the strange reluctance
shown by Burgess to a personal meeting, the old man had been
impressed with the idea that Burgess had deserted his companions,
and, in reality, knew nothing of their fate. Under these
circumstances, why should his brother stay away, if alive?</p>

<p>Not many weeks after this the letter from Burgess arrived,
enclosed is one from a brother, stating that the writer was dead,
and had requested that on his death the enclosed should be
forwarded as directed. Burgess in his letter merely said that he
had buried certain papers belonging to his brother confided to
his care, and gave a description of the place. He made no
explanation of his motive for concealing the papers, nor for his
conduct in avoiding an interview, but wound up with the ominous
sentence&mdash;"In these papers you will find the true account of
your brother's death."</p>

<p>It was noticeable that he only referred to one brother,
although he had stated to everybody that both were dead.</p>

<p>Patten mused dejectedly for some time, then wrote a short
letter to Hopwood, thanking him for his letter.</p>

<p>"Blanche," he said that evening to his eldest sister, whom he
had to a certain extent taken into his confidence, "I have
already told you that I have reason to believe that Alf is still
alive. Now I want you to communicate this belief to the others,
for I should not be surprised to see him turn up any day."</p>

<p>"Surely, Bob, you have not heard from him, have you?" she
returned, in surprise.</p>

<p>"No; but I have reason to think that the only obstacle to his
reappearance, has been removed. If he is alive, as I believe, I'm
pretty confident that we shall see something of him shortly."</p>

<p>"But it will make an awful difference to you, will it not? In
the station I mean."</p>

<p>"Certainly; it all belongs to him. Our mother will have a
third by law, which will be enough for her and you girls; but I
shall be asked to leave, you may be sure, as soon as Alf comes in
possession. Fortunately, I have made a little money on my own
account during the last ten years, so shall not be quite
penniless."</p>

<p>His sister left him; and Robert remained smoking on the
moonlit verandah. Like a flash of light, it had suddenly
illumined his mind that the reason Alf did not reappear was
because of Burgess. Once he heard of Burgess's death, he would
not hesitate to come and claim his heritage. There was now no
doubt in his mind. Burgess had been either a witness or
accomplice in some deed that would not bear the light of day.</p>

<p>He turned to go inside the house, when the tread of a horse
approaching made him look round. Instinctively, he knew who was
coming&mdash;the supposed dead man had returned to his own
place.</p>

<p>In the bright clear moonlight he easily recognised the rider,
who dismounted, and hung his bridle on the picket fence that
surrounded the garden, then approached the gate that led to the
house.</p>

<p>Robert called to his sister&mdash;"Blanche! our expected
visitor has come," and strolled down the path to meet his
half-brother.</p>

<p>"Well, Bob," said the latter as they met, "I suppose you hoped
never to see me again?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, Alf," said Robert quietly, "I have been
expecting you for some time. What have you been keeping up this
farce so long for?"</p>

<p>"That I will tell you presently. Are we to go back on the old
terms, although ten years have passed? Have you got neither word
nor hand to welcome a fellow?"</p>

<p>"Let's have a mutual explanation first, both with regard to
Sam's death and your silence."</p>

<p>"Very well. Evidently, you are not pleased at the boss coming
home. Will you tell one of the fellows to turn my horse out, and
then we will see if the others of you are a little warmer in
their welcome."</p>

<p>Robert called one of the men, who took the horse; and the two
men entered the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Patten and the girls received the wanderer with at any
rate an assumption of cordiality. They knew nothing of the graver
doubts that tormented their brother, and, with womanly
tenderness, endeavoured to make the unexpected arrival feel that
he was welcome to his own home. The ten years of absence had not
altered him much, save that, to Robert, he seemed coarser and
rougher in his manner and conversation, as though his time had
been passed amongst inferior associates.</p>

<p>He at once told his stepmother that he was going to have a
long talk With his half-brother, and explain his absence; and
taking the hint, the women soon retired and left the two men
together. Both smoked in silence for a while, then Alf suddenly
remarked, "What did that hound Burgees say when he got in?"</p>

<p>Robert had anticipated the question. He handed his brother one
of the old newspapers containing the printed account.</p>

<p>The other read it through in silence. "A tissue of lies, with
a word of truth here and there," was his comment when he came to
the end. "How did you think I was alive, after such a statement
as that?"</p>

<p>"Old Broadhurst saw you in Adelaide over two years ago."</p>

<p>"Did Burgess tell you any more than he has done here?"</p>

<p>"I never saw him. For some unaccountable reason, he dodged me
always, and I could not get a personal interview with him."</p>

<p>"Now, I will tell you what really happened," said Alf. "In the
first place, the statement that we were successful in getting
beyond the South Australian border for some distance is true. On
our return, we camped near a patch of poisonous plant, and lost a
number of our horses. That also is true."</p>

<p>"The bones of the horses have been found," interjected
Robert.</p>

<p>"But no human remains?" said the other, somewhat hastily.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Of course, because there were none to find&mdash;at least,
there. We got on to a dry stage, and found the water we depended
on, dry. That is true. Now come the lies. We stopped at that dry
hole dead beat, and debated what was best to be done. Before us
were about fifty miles of dry country, and at the end of it an
uncertainty. Behind us were thirty miles dry country and the
water we had left, a certainty. We decided to turn back after
taking a few hours' rest. We had only five horses left. Two of
them were fairly strong, and the other three weak and knocked up.
That night, while we slept, Burgess sneaked off with the two
strong horses and nearly all the water and rations, and left us
to our fate. No wonder he would not meet you."</p>

<p>Both men were silent after this disclosure.</p>

<p>"What happened then?" said Robert at last.</p>

<p>"When we awoke and found Burgess gone, we could do nothing but
tramp back to the water we had left. There we arrived more dead
than alive, with two out of the three horses, the other one
having died on the road. We decided to make for the Overland
Telegraph Line. This, to make a long story short, eventually we
did; but I was the only one who reached it. The black boy died, I
cannot say of what. He gave in, and lost pluck. Sam was speared
by the natives on a creek about a hundred miles east of the line,
and died in about an hour. We had used up every cartridge when
they tackled us, or it would not have happened."</p>

<p>Robert started at these words, for they seemed such an echo of
the story told by Burgess; and yet, according to this version,
Burgess could have known nothing of the fate of the men he
deserted.</p>

<p>"I got to the Line, and luckily came across a repairing party,
and they took me in to Barrow Creek Station&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And with the telegraph right at your hand, you never wired
our father a word of either Sam or yourself?" interrupted
Robert.</p>

<p>Alf got up, and impatiently walked about the room. "To tell
you the truth, I had not the heart. I blamed myself right
through. I had no business to persuade Sam to come and risk his
life. I would rather you thought us both dead, than have to come
home alone; I felt that I had been the cause of his death."</p>

<p>"What did you do then, Alf?"</p>

<p>"We had some good country on our way across; and when I got
down to Adelaide, I took up the lease on it, and sold it very
well. I fell in with some men going to South Africa; and as I had
a roving fit on me, I joined them, and was there five years. I
volunteered for the Zulu War, and saw a good deal of it. Then I
came back to Australia, and went up to the gold rush at
Kimberley. Everywhere I did well, just because I did not
particularly want it, I suppose. At last I got tired of knocking
about, and determined to come home and declare myself. I may as
well tell you that I had seen the notice of the old man's death
in a Sydney paper, and you know as well as I do that after his
death there is not a soul here who would not prefer that I had
never returned. I am not, and never was, a favourite with my
father's second family. As it is, I suppose that I appear to oust
you; but I have no intention of doing so. There is enough for us
all. I could never play the part of the modern squatter."</p>

<p>"It is late, Alf," said Robert, rising. "I have much to think
of. Believe me, that nobody here is sorry to see you back; but
you must admit that your silence and absence under such
circumstances as the death of Sam were peculiar. Is it not
so?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps; but I presume you are satisfied as to my own
identity! Tell me," he went on, as his brother halted for a
moment at the door, "has little Kate Rudder grown up as pretty as
she promised to be?"</p>

<p>"Miss Rudder," returned Robert coldly, "has grown up as pretty
and good as she promised to be. Now, good night. Your old room is
ready for you. You know the way." He closed the door almost as he
spoke.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Alf smiled somewhat grimly. "I touched Master
Bob on a tender spot seemingly. Evidently he has his eye on Kate
Rudder."</p>

<p>He turned the lamp out and went to his room.</p>

<p>It was quite true Alf Patten had touched upon a tender spot
when he mentioned Kate Rudder's name to his brother. The Rudders
owned the neighbouring station, and the two families had always
been on the moat friendly footing. Kate, the youngest and only
unmarried girl, was now a brilliant and beautiful young woman of
one-and-twenty, with half a dozen aspirants for her hand. Robert
was sorely smitten, and had reason to believe that he had some
chance of success, but his brother's remark gave him some
troubled thoughts that night. Robert Patten, the owner of half
the station and a good deal of other property, and Robert Patten
beginning life afresh on a small and limited capital, were two
very different men. He had no reason to think the girl mercenary
or capricious, but his nature had a warp of distrust in it which
often led him to suspect the motives of other people without
cause, and in the present instance influenced him against
accenting the liberal speeches of his returned relative without
large discount.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
THE return of the eldest son and heir to the station created
the usual amount of gossip in the district. Alf kept up the
character he had first assumed of careless liberality, and did
not interfere with Robert's management. He soon renewed his
intimacy with the Rudders, and, as was but natural, became a
devoted admirer of Kate's. On her part it was only to be supposed
that she should feel interested in him. He had plenty to talk
about that had a certain charm of novelty; his adventures during
the Zulu War and in the outside districts of Australia were told
without boasting, and served to put him on a small heroic
pedestal in the community.</p>

<p>As may be presumed, this intimacy with the Rudders was not at
all to Robert's liking; and both men felt that it was, after all,
but a hollow truce between them, and one that might be ruptured
at any moment. Kate Rudder had no thought of arousing the younger
brother's jealousy by treating the elder so intimately. She
sincerely liked Robert, and it only wanted a word from him to
awaken a warmer feeling.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it was different with Alf. He had fallen head
over ears in love with Kate, and felt certain that it was
returned. It was evident that such a state of things could not go
on long without an explosion of some sort. Blanche had long
guessed Robert's secret, and was prepared to become an active
ally should the turn of affairs necessitate it.</p>

<p>The smothered feud broke out one night when the two men were
smoking a pipe before retiring.</p>

<p>"I intend to try my luck to-morrow," said Alf. "It's time I
settled down and got married."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," returned Robert, somewhat meaningly,
"Where are you going to condescend to throw the
handkerchief?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't put on side. You know very well I am going to ask
Kate Rudder, and have every reason to suppose she will say
yes."</p>

<p>"It's a lie," replied Bob furiously, a sudden gust of passion
completely overcoming him.</p>

<p>Alf started, but checked himself. "I can afford to laugh at
you," he said. "Rave away; it won't whistle your sweetheart
back."</p>

<p>"If you put your boast to the test tomorrow," said Robert in a
calmer tone, "you will find yourself mistaken. I should advise
you to stay at home."</p>

<p>"Keep your advice to yourself, and don't provoke me," said
the other, who was now in his turn losing his temper.</p>

<p>"Provoke you, indeed!" repeated Robert contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Yes, you beggar, or I'll soon get rid of you."</p>

<p>"As you did Sam!"</p>

<p>Alf leaped to his feet, speechless with a mixture of rage and
fear. Next minute the two men would have been at each other's
throats, but the door opened, and Blanche entered.</p>

<p>"I heard your voices raised," she said, affecting not to
notice their menacing attitudes; "what are you quarrelling
about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we never could agree of old," said Robert, trying to calm
himself as his sister approached him.</p>

<p>"Look here, my fine fellow," said Alf, "tomorrow you take
yourself, bag and baggage, out of this; and just see that your
accounts are square when I come to overhaul them."</p>

<p>Robert's face turned fiery red; but Blanche caught his band.
"If Bob goes, I go too," she said.</p>

<p>"You are quite welcome," returned Alf, who had completely
dropped the mask.</p>

<p>"I will give you full satisfaction about the station accounts
to-morrow morning," said Robert; "and in a short time I trust you
will be able to give an equally satisfactory account of what I
shall require from you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded the other fiercely.</p>

<p>"Simply I do not believe your version of your trip out west. I
will see what Burgess has to say in the matter."</p>

<p>"You will have to go to another place than Queensland, then,
for he is dead."</p>

<p>"Oh, you knew that, did you? And yet you pretended to ask
after him."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! I will not stop to listen to any more nonsense.
To-morrow I will show you who is master here." He left the
room.</p>

<p>The brother and sister had a long conversation, during which,
for the first time, Robert told her about the buried papers and
what he suspected of their import. Blanche was naturally
horrified, and reiterated her now fixed determination to leave on
the following day. Robert impressed upon her the necessity of
absolute secrecy; and they were about parting, when she asked him
where he was going to when he left. For herself, she was going on
a visit to an aunt for a while.</p>

<p>"I'm going to the Northern Territory or South Australia to
look for Jim Turner," he said.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he had his hand on the door, and half opened it.
A noise outside struck his ear, and he threw it wide open, and
looked along the passage. A dark shadow vanished at the end as he
did so, and it immediately occurred to him that Alf had been
listening.</p>

<p>"Forewarned is forearmed," he thought as he retired. "I must
guard against Master Alf getting any inkling of those papers, or
he will be beforehand with me." Then he thought that if Alf had
been listening he would have heard all he confided to Blanche,
but on second consideration, he remembered that they had spoken
low, all but the last words referring to Jim Turner, and it would
be hard to trace anything from that.</p>

<p>Blanche had given her brother a hint that he had better test
his fate with Kate Rudder as soon as practicable, and he
determined to do it the first thing in the morning, if possible
before he settled up with his brother. With this object in view
he was up at daylight, and by sunrise was on his way, calculating
that he would arrive at the Rudders' Station in time for
breakfast, he managed to hit the meal very nicely; and while
seated thereat, he informed his friends of his resignation, or
rather deposition, in favour of his eldest brother. As the terms
on which the two men stood were pretty well known, this
intimation did not surprise anybody. It elicited, however, a
quick glance of sympathy from Kate, which was sufficient
satisfaction for Robert.</p>

<p>He soon made an opportunity to ask the momentous question. As
two ships converge towards each other in mid-ocean on a calm day,
so the wooing and the wooed have a silent occult speech of their
own which is better than an outspoken language, and serves just
as well to convey the intended meaning.</p>

<p>In the old nursery and schoolroom, now turned into a lonely
kind of lumber-room seldom visited. Kate and Robert plighted
their troth; and then he departed with a light heart to seek the
consent of her parent. Old Rudder half expected what was coming,
and Robert was delighted to find that the return of the rightful
heir did not affect his suit. The fact was that Rudder had seen
enough of him and his management during the put ten years to feel
assured that young Patten was one of the men bound to rise, and
than the present would be merely a temporary eclipse.</p>

<p>The fifteen miles home&mdash;home no longer&mdash;were soon
covered, and he entered the house to find his half-brother
waiting for him. To his surprise Alf approached him in the
sunniest manner possible.</p>

<p>"Look here, old man," he said; "we shall always be snarling at
each other, I suppose, at long as we are together; but let us
have a try to do better in future at any rate. I will take back
anything I said last night, if you will do the same."</p>

<p>"I have made up my mind to go away and strike out for myself,"
returned Robert, after a pause. "As you admit, we should always
he quarrelling; so it is best to part. I am glad it is not in
anger, and am willing to forget the hasty words exchanged last
night."</p>

<p>"I suppose that is as much as I can expect from you," replied
the other. "Go or stay, I shall not quarrel with you."</p>

<p>After a hasty packing up, Robert and his sister started in a
buggy to the neighbouring township of W&mdash;, whence they would
take the train to Sydney, where Robert intended to leave Blanche
with their aunt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Alf went headlong to his fate. He had determined to
propose to Kate Rudder, and rode over that day for the purpose.
What he then learned did not improve his temper. He rode home in
a mood of sullen spite, revolving in his mind the best way to
obtain his own will and thwart his rival.</p>

<p>Robert wrote a short but explicit letter to Owen, the Manager
of Bendabar, on whom he thought he could rely, asking him to
observe the strictest reticence concerning the buried papers and
their whereabouts, and if any one turned up enquiring for them,
to put the seeker, if possible, on a false scent. He further took
him into his confidence concerning the return of his eldest
brother, supposed to be dead; and also told him of his purposed
quest for Turner, who seemed to be the only man who could point
out the hiding-place. He then made a hasty trip to
W&mdash;&mdash;to say good-bye to his sweetheart, and started
ostensibly to look for a suitable pastoral investment; in
reality, he took the first steamer for Port Darwin.</p>

<p>A long narrow clearing through a dense scrub of upright
"mulga." In the centre of this cleared track runs a row of
telegraph poles, supporting a single wire, the slender link that
traverses the Australian Continent from north to south, and binds
it with an almost living bond to the rest of the world. At the
edge of this thicket of mulga is a patch of open country, thinly
timbered with coolabah trees. Here, alongside the rude dray track
that winds side by side with the line, are a couple of iron
tanks, each containing about four hundred gallons of water, tanks
such as are used on board of sailing ships. A line-repairing
party are camped on this open spot, and the tanks are kept full
for the use of the men employed in the maintenance of the line.
There are three men in the camp&mdash;an operator and two
line-men&mdash;it is the middle of the day, and they are taking
it easy in the shade; their riding and pack horses, hobbled out,
are feeding a short distance away.</p>

<p>"Here comes the man they were telling me about when we spoke
to Daly Waters Station," suddenly remarked the operator, gazing
up the long northern vista of the line.</p>

<p>"The man who is in search of Jim?" said one of the men,
glancing at the third, who looked rather conscious.</p>

<p>Jim, who was the long-sought-for Jim Turner, busied himself in
putting the fire together and placing a quart pot of water on to
boil, for hospitality is the sacred creed of the bush; and the
party were silent until the stranger rode up to the camp and
dismounted.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are the repairing party from Daly Waters?" said
the new comer, after the customary greetings.</p>

<p>"Yes," returned the operator, "and I presume you are the man
they wired to me about looking for Jim Turner. This is Turner,"
and he indicated the man in question.</p>

<p>The two nodded, and Patten&mdash;for it was
Robert&mdash;remarked, "I have had a long hunt for you. I suppose
you are wondering what it is all about?"</p>

<p>"Better turn your horses out and have something to eat."
interrupted the operator; "plenty of time for business
afterwards."</p>

<p>Patten accepted the invitation; and after eating his meal and
finishing the regulation pipe, drew Turner on one side and
broached the object of his visit.</p>

<p>"You were a stockman on Bendabar," he said, "and were with Mr.
Hopwood when you picked up Burgess."</p>

<p>Turner assented. "The fact is simply this, you left Burgess to
rest down there, while you went up to the Station, got fresh
horses, and came down again. While you were away, he buried
certain papers he had, enclosing them in an old salmon tin that
he had picked up there. He is dead now; but before he died, he
wrote and told me of these papers, giving me directions to find
them by means of the marked trees about. I went to the place; but
it is now all changed. The trees have been cut down; and a heavy
flood has altered the appearance and size of the water-holes in
the river. No one on the station knew the exact place; and as the
clue he had given me was useless, my only chance was to find
Hopwood or yourself; so I advertised in the leading papers."</p>

<p>Patten paused.</p>

<p>"I never knew of the advertisement until the other day," said
Turner; "and then one of the chaps spotted it in an old number of
the <i>Australasian</i>. Did you hear from Mr. Hopwood?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and he wrote and said that, under the changed
circumstances, he did not believe that he could point out the
exact spot."</p>

<p>"Then I'm blowed if I could," said Turner.</p>

<p>This was hard on Patten, and he hesitated for a moment. "Look
here, Turner," he returned; "there's no occasion to speak
hastily. Think the matter over, and see if you cannot remember
any slight thing that will bring it back to you."</p>

<p>Turner pondered for a short time. "I might find the place if I
was back there," he hazarded doubtfully at last.</p>

<p>"It's most important that I get these papers," went on Robert.
"I have been tracking you up now for six months, and I am not
going to be baulked for a trifle. I believe if you were on the
spot it would all come back to you. I will tell you what I will
do. I suppose your billet here is nothing very much. You could do
as well in Queensland."</p>

<p>"Just as well," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Then I will pay your expenses round to the place, and allow
you a couple of pounds a week during the time we are travelling.
If we are successful in getting the papers, or what is left of
them, I will give you a hundred pounds."</p>

<p>"I'm in it," cried Jim, without any hesitation; and they
turned back to the camp.</p>

<p>Patten was sound asleep that night when he was suddenly
aroused by somebody shaking him by the shoulder. Rousing himself,
he found it was Turner.</p>

<p>"It has all come back to me," he said in an excited sort of
whisper. "I lay there thinking about picking up that man, and
trying to puzzle out how I could make sure of the place, when all
of a sudden I remembered about filling the quart pots. Right
straight under our camp a bar of rook crossed the bed of the
rivet. I remember it well because the water was deep just
alongside, and it was so handy to stand on and dip the quarts, Of
course, Mr. Hopwood doesn't recall it because he didn't go down
the bank; but I was down two or three times."</p>

<p>"By Jove, that's something definite," returned Robert; "but I
noticed several bars crossing the river here and there."</p>

<p>"Ah! but this one was a slate bar with a seam of quartz
running beside it. No flood could alter that, could it?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think so," said Patten.</p>

<p>They left the camp; and in due time they arrived in Keppel
Bay, where, leaving the mail steamer in which they had travelled,
they ascended the Fitzroy River in the tender. Robert stood on
the wharf waiting for his luggage to be put ashore, when a hand
was laid on his shoulder. He turned to find his half-brother
beside him.</p>

<p>"I expected, you Bob," he said. "Now, supposing we make this
little trip to Bendebar together."</p>

<p>Robert was scarcely surprised at the unwelcome appearance of
his half-brother. He had all along suspected that he had
overheard his conversation with his sister relative to the search
for Jim Turner, and naturally would have kept a watch on his
movements. He therefore accepted the situation without much
comment; but as soon as he could get away without exciting
suspicion, made his way to the telegraph office. Here he wired to
Owen at Bendabar, giving him the clue of the rocky bar and all
other details furnished by Turner. He asked him to follow the
search up at once, and if successful, to keep the papers until
his arrival, and restore the spot where they were found to its
original state, as though it had been undisturbed. This done, he
felt more at ease.</p>

<p>He knew that Alf would soon get all he wanted to know out of
poor, simple Jim; and he was not at all sure that he did not
intend to play him some trick on the way up and get ahead of him.
The four hundred miles to the station were, however, negotiated
without any mishap. He did not trust himself to exchange glances
with Owen, lest Alf's sharp eyes should note it; but as soon as
there was an opportunity, the Manager told him that he had been
quite successful. The papers were still in the tin; but Robert
begged his friend to keep them where they were until the farce of
a search had been gone through.</p>

<p>Next morning they started down the river and Jim Turner soon
identified the spot where they were camped when Burgess appeared.
Needless to say, the search&mdash;extended into the next
day&mdash;was fruitless. The general conclusion was that if
Burgess had buried anything, it had been only just beneath the
surface, and the tin was probably soon laid bare. In that case,
the first bush fire that swept over the spot would destroy the
contents.</p>

<p>Alf did not seem at all elated at the fact that nothing had
transpired; and Robert guessed that the state of uncertainty was
worse to him than the discovery of the hidden tin would have
been.</p>

<p>Jim Turner was rewarded; and Alf took his leave, Robert
announcing his attention of spending a few days with his friend
Owen. From something he noticed in Alf's manner, he mistrusted
the fact that he had really left the station, and believed that
his suspicions had been aroused by the non-discovery of anything,
and that he was still keeping a watch on his movements. So
impressed was he with this idea, that it was not until he retired
and locked himself in his bedroom that he commenced his
investigation. The tin had preserved its contents with wonderful
fidelity. On lifting the lid the papers appeared to be in almost
as good a state of preservation as when first placed there. There
were three folded papers and a small notebook. He opened the
folded papers. They were all in his brother Sam's writing, in
pencil, and, by a strange coincidence, he read them in their
proper sequence. The first was addressed to himself, and
ran:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
Dear Bob&mdash;We have had back luck, and worst of all, I
have met with an accident that has crippled me. I am just
scribbling this to say good-by in case things take a turn for the
bad. If I don't turn up again, you know how to act for the good
of all at home.</p>
<br>

<p>Then followed some affectionate messages to his mother and
sisters.</p>

<p>The second paper bore date the next day, and was but a few
lines:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">
Burgess has come back. I am much worse, in awful pain;
shall never leave here. Thank God, I am not deserted by
everybody.</p>
<br>

<p>The third and last was almost illegible; the reader managed to
decipher&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">Burgess will tell&mdash;too bad&mdash;I had
forgiven&mdash;now left here&mdash;die.</p>
<br>

<p>The rest was unintelligible.</p>

<p>Robert dropped the message from the dead man whose bones lay
in the desert. His half-brother's name was not mentioned; but he
read the whole story as though it had been printed. Sam had met
with an accident, and Alf bad left him to get on as best he
could. But what was the accident? and how did he meet with it!
The notebook would tell him that.</p>

<p>He took it up and opened it. Just then all the dogs on the
station commenced to bark furiously, as though some one was
coming. He opened his window and looked out; but all seemed,
quiet; and after a fight among themselves the dogs subsided into
silence.</p>

<p>He commenced the notebook, wherein Burgess had, as he said,
told the true story of Sam's death.</p>
<br>

<p class="quote">
"I promised Sam Patten when he was dying that I would tell the
truth; and I swore to Alf, after he saved my life from the
blacks, that I would not. I will write it all down; hide it, and
never speak of it again. I don't know what to do. From the start
Alf Patten made himself disagreeable; and although Sam stood it
very quietly for some time, at last he quarrelled with him; and
after that, there was nothing but rows between them. The morning
we found five of the horses poisoned they had the worst quarrel.
Alf was away, when we camped the night before, and he blamed his
brother for not noticing the poison plant about. While they were
still at it, the black boy and I started after two of the horses
that had strayed away. While we were tracking them up, we both
thought we beard a pistol shot in the direction of the camp. When
we got back with the horses, we found that there had been an
accident. Sam, while doing something to his revolver, had
accidentally touched the trigger and shot himself through the
hand. That was the story they told us. It was a clean wound; and
I did not think it would turn out bad. We had good country and
easy travelling for a day or two, and Sam's hand seemed getting
on very well; then we had a long dry stage and hot weather. Sam's
hand took a turn for the worse, and when we got to some good
water and grass, he said he could go no farther, but must stay
there until his hand was easier. Ever since that morning the
brothers had not spoken, and Sam would not let his brother help
him in any way. We spent three days at the waterhole, and the
rest and plenty of cold water bandages did the wound good. A If
had been getting very impatient, and at last he said that we had
come nearly as far as we wanted to, and seen most of the country
they had come to look at; that the best thing to do was for Sam
to stop in the camp, while we went on about fifty miles further,
and then we could go home by easy stages. This meant that we
should be away from Sam for nearly three days, and I would not
agree to it. But Sam himself persuaded me; he was anxious to get
home, and thought that by the time we got back he would be able
to ride, and there would be nothing to detain us. We started the
next morning. While we were packing and saddling the horses, Alf
went up and spoke to his brother. Whatever it was he said, the
quarrel broke out again at once, and when we started, Alf bad
gone back to one of his fiendish tempers. We went about thirty
miles that day and camped. The next morning, as we were starting,
I asked Patten how far we were going before turning back. He
said&mdash;'Right on to the Overland Telegraph Line.' I pulled
up, and said I would go no farther, but would return, to the
camp. He argued with me that Sam was all right, and even tried to
threaten me; but I rode away, and he and the black boy went
on.</p>

<p class="quote">
"I got back to camp that evening, and found Sam very bad. I
think the excitement of the quarrel with his brother had inflamed
the wound again. Next morning he was in terrible agony, and his
arm was swollen right up to the shoulder. He was delirious, and
kept praying me to out his arm off. I never left his side except
to get water to keep the bandages wet. The next afternoon he
suddenly fell asleep, but woke up just at sundown. He was quite
sensible, and had no pain at all; only, he said, 'he felt too
weak to move.' He talked to me quietly about going back,
thinking, now the pain had left him, he would be strong enough to
ride in the morning. He told me that his wound was not an
accident, but that his brother in a fit of passion had threatened
him with his revolver: that he had tried to take it from him, and
in the struggle it had gone off and shot him through the hand. He
never meant to say anything about it, but for his brother going
away and leaving him; and asked me to tell the true story if
anything happened to him, and I promised. Presently, he said to
me&mdash;'This is heavenly to be free from that terrible pain; I
shall sleep so soundly to-night, old man.' He never spoke again.
I scarcely know when he died, but I think it was about an hour
afterwards."</p>

<p class="quote">
"NEXT morning, I was digging a grave as best I could, when Alf
and the black boy came up. They had been riding all night. He was
like a mad man when he saw Sam's body, called himself a murderer,
and vowed that he would go back and give himself up to be hanged.
After Sam was buried, this fit seemed to wear off; and next
morning we started home. We scarcely ever spoke during the next
few days. Once he asked me what story I was going to tell when we
got in, and I said, 'The true one.' A week after Sam's death we
got to the Herbert River, and camped near a waterhole. Suddenly
the place seemed alive with blacks, and a shower of spears and
'nullas' fell around us. The black boy was speared clean through
the body; but I only got a crack with a nulla. I used my
revolver, and made a rush for a carbine that was lying where I
had been sleeping; but before I got there I was knocked down, and
the niggers rushed in and got hold of me. Another moment and my
brains would have been beaten out; but just then Alf came to my
relief and saved me. The black boy was dead. That night when we
were talking it over, Alf said, 'I think I saved your life today,
Burgess. Poor Sam is dead and gone, and it will do no good raking
up our quarrel; cannot you hold your tongue when you get in?' Of
course he had saved my life, and I scarcely knew what to say.
'How shall we account for Sam's death?' I said at last. 'He was
killed here by the blacks,' he replied, pointing back to where
the fight had been. So it fell out that I agreed. He swore that
he intended to go away and change his name rather than face going
home, and I promised to tell the story we made up that night.
Next morning we parted. He took three horses and most of the
rations, as he intended to make for the Overland Telegraph Line,
and I took the two worst horses, to try and get in to the nearest
station. They died on the road, and I have walked in. I do not
know whether I have done right or wrong; but this is the truth.
With this book I bury three letters that Sam wrote and gave to
me. Alf knows nothing of them."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">
It was all out now; and Robert knew that every word was plain
truth. He could see his half-brother in every line of the
confession&mdash;the outbreaks of uncontrollable temper followed
by fits of short-lived remorse. Doubtless, when he parted from
Burgess he fully intended to keep his vow, and be henceforth a
dead man to those who had known him. But time had blunted his
feelings of regret; his character had degenerated; he had grown
tired of his self-imposed exile, and the death of Burgess had
been too great a temptation to return, removing as it did the
only witness to his crime, for although no laws could touch him
he was as guilty of his half-brother's death as if he had shot
him through the head.</p>

<p>What was he to do? He looked up, and stared; there, pressed
close against the glass of the window, was the face of his
half-brother. The expression on it arrested Robert in the not of
rising. He scarcely knew whether he was gazing at a living face
or a dead one, it wore such a ghastly look. While he was
hesitating it vanished.</p>

<p>Robert went to the window, which was an ordinary French light,
opening on to the verandah, unlocked it, and was about stepping
out, when he paused. A meeting between them just then had better
be avoided; evidently Alf's uneasy conscience had dragged him
back; he knew now that Robert knew the truth, and he could do no
more harm.</p>

<p>He stood at the door and listened. There was a sudden outbreak
from the dogs; then he heard the sound of a horse cantering down
the paddock. The nocturnal visitor was gone. But Robert's way was
no clearer, and he passed a wretched, sleepless night.</p>

<p>On the third day, a man rode up to the station with a note for
Robert. It was from Alf, and ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">
Whatever Burgess wrote is true. I know you found the
papers, and have read them. I am going a long way out West, and
this time I shall not return.</p>

<p class="letter">Good-by.</p>
<br>

<p>The writing was so unlike Alf's hard, firm hand that Robert
instinctively asked the man, who was the ostler at a small
public-house some thirty miles away, whether his brother had been
drinking heavily.</p>

<p>"He went it pretty hot for a couple of days," returned the
man; "but he seemed all right when he started this morning."</p>

<p>"He had gone, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes; started the same time that I did. He said he was going
to Barr Downs to-night," naming a station to the westward.</p>

<p>Robert pondered over the communication.</p>

<p>Was it reality this time, and did it point to a suicide's
expiation?</p>

<p>He determined to follow. Turner was still on the station,
having taken a place as boundary-rider, so he engaged him to
accompany him; and Owen provided him with a black boy, a good
tracker; for there was no knowing how far he might have to go. By
the time he was ready Alf had three days' start of him.</p>

<p>It was easy enough to follow him, for he was making due west
from station to station, and travellers were not very common as
they got into the sparsely settled outside district. He could not
gain on him, however; at every station where he stopped the night
Alf had always left just the three days before. The last place
they crossed&mdash;the Herbert &mdash; Robert thought he
recognised the waterhole where the blacks had attacked Burgess,
but all tokens of the fierce fight bad long been dispersed by
successive floods.</p>

<p>At last they came to the most outside station, within about
fifty miles of the Queensland Border. Beyond was still unsettled
country for about three hundred miles to the Overland Telegraph
Line. Alf had stayed the night at this place, and next morning he
had gone on by himself, leaving the people on the place in some
perplexity as to where he was bound to from then on out. Robert
knew they would have to follow his tracks. Once in the unoccupied
country this was comparatively easy, and they went on the first
day without a check. Robert knew as well as if Alf had told him
that their destination was Sam's lonely grave&mdash;would he get
there too late?</p>

<p>They camped the first night at a small hole of water at the
head of a rocky creek. Next morning, still following the tracks
of the two horses, they crossed a low range, and emerged on to a
wide plain. By night they found themselves on a small clay flat
with tired and thirsty horses. They had water for themselves in
their canvas bags; but unless there was some ahead, their horses
would not last through another day of such fatiguing
travelling.</p>

<p>Alf had, however, camped on the flat, so it was evident that
he was making for some place ahead that he knew of.</p>

<p>On again the next morning. Straight across the plain went the
tracks, and with jaded horses the party followed them. When
within about a mile of the creek the black boy, who was ahead
tracking, pulled up and pointed to the trees.</p>

<p>Half a dozen kites were circling slowly in the air over a
particular spot, looking like black specks in the distance.</p>

<p>"There's water there," said Turner.</p>

<p>Robert did not answer, but motioned to the boy, and they
pressed on. In a short time they rode up to the bank of the
creek, in the bed of which was a shallow pool of water. The loose
horses ran down and commenced greedily drinking; two others, who
were feeding on the edge of the waterhole, greeted them with loud
whinnies.</p>

<p>A glance told Robert he was too late. He motioned to Turner
and the boy to go on to the water, and dismounting, tied the
reins to his stirrup-iron, and let his thirsty horse go loose
after the rest.</p>

<p>A man was lying at the foot of a coolabah tree. He might have
been asleep, but people as a rule do not sleep in the noontide
glare of a tropical sun. It was his brother, dead by his own
hand. On the tree, at the foot of which he lay, a sheet of bark
had been stripped off years before, and on the surface of the
wood beneath, the initials S.P. had been rudely out. Robert at
once divined that the letters had been carved by Burgess, and
beneath was Sam's grave.</p>

<p><br>
THEY buried the lifeless form that had once held such fierce
conflicting passions by the side of the man whose death lay at
his door; and in the grave Robert placed the written testimonies
of the expiated guilt. The message that had come from the desert
was left to moulder there&mdash;no man now would ever know it.
Alf himself had solved for Robert the question of what he should
do with the knowledge bequeathed him by the dead.</p>

<p>Next morning, with a saddened heart, the only surviving
brother retraced his steps through the untrodden waste that
surrounded the two graves.</p>

<p>In after years, when wife and children were his, and
prosperity and contentment, his thoughts would often be recalled
by a chance word to that time, and like a picture would rise
clearly before him the scene he saw as he turned in his saddle
for a last look&mdash;the gaunt and desolate plain; the creek,
bordered with dwarfed, distorted timber; the soaring, tireless
kites; the fierce sun overhead beating down on the graves of his
brothers beneath the stunted, shadeless, coolabah-tree.</p>

<h2><a id="ch21"></a>21. -- THE CONFESSION OF GILES OSBORNE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 25 June, 2 July 1898</h3>

<h3><i>PART 1. -- THE STORY MY FATHER TOLD ME.</i></h3>

<p class="first">
I WAS born in a port town, in the south of England. We were
nearly all sailors in that town, from the time we were boys, old
enough, to go on board and earn "monkey's allowance". When I was
born Nelson was still alive, but on the eve of death and Victory,
and naturally every boy's thoughts turned to the sea. My father
was a warrant officer who had sailed with the great navigator,
Captain Cook, and was with him when he found the southern
continent of Australia; and with him, too, when he was murdered
by the savages same years afterwards. So it was but natural that
I always looked upon the sea as my future home.</p>

<p>My imagination was also fed by the stories my father told of
the beautiful islands of the south, and the joy of sailing over
unknown seas, never knowing when some strange and wonderful land
might at any moment be sighted by the look-out. My father, from
his long voyages in discovery ships, had imbibed ideas above the
average man-of-warsman, and from what he had seen was impressed
by the advantages that education gave a man, even in the
navy.</p>

<p>So I had to thank him for being educated above the other boys
of my class, end when I went to sea as a boy I could read and
write well and easily, which few of my shipmates could. But it
was not until after the Battle of Waterloo had been, won and
peace established, and everyone rejoicing that Boney was safe on
St. Helena, that I made my first voyage, and, to my intense
disgust, on a merchantman.</p>

<p>However, my father, who was still hale and hearty, said that
now peace was declared, there would be no chance at sea for
men-of-warsmen, and the merchantmen would have the best of
it.</p>

<p>So, into the merchant service I went, and when my father died
I had worked my way up, through the hawse-hole, to third mate. My
first voyage in that capacity was, strange to say, to the only
country I had not yet visited in my many voyages&mdash;Australia.
The ship was the <i>Lucretia</i>, 389 tons, with a general cargo
and passengers, bound for a new settlement called Fremantle, on
the west coast of Australia, or New Holland, as it was still
often called.</p>

<p>I was then 26 years of age, with the reputation of being a
smart sailor, and nothing besides, for my father's pension had,
of course, died with him, and his savings had been consumed in
eking out the scanty dole that rewarded a life of hardship. I had
no kith nor kin that I knew of, and the world was before me.</p>

<p>The second mate of the <i>Lucretia</i> came of a better stock
than I did. He was about two years older; and his parents were
impoverished gentlefolks, but he had not worked before the mast
like I had. His father had held a commission in the army, and had
fallen at Waterloo. His name was Holmer, Daniel Holmer, and mine
is Roger Osborne, and at that time we were fast friends; but
never after that voyage.</p>

<p>Amongst the cabin passengers was an elderly gentleman, with
two daughters, who, like so many more at that time, had turned
all he had into ready money, and, allured by the tempting offers
of the Government, had emigrated to Australia, to take advantage
of the liberal grants of land then bestowed. Like many more of
that day he was totally unfitted by training for the life of an
emigrant, but then none of us on board knew any better, nor
dreamt that the land we were bound for was as yet an untouched
wilderness. The Government who promised these people estates that
to English eyes seemed boundless did not tell them that it all
had to be reclaimed by years of laborious toil.</p>

<p>The daughters, Kate and Mary Bonner, were both handsome girls,
but, with the perverseness of fate, both of us must needs let our
affections become ensnared by winsome little Mary. We had bright
hopes, and much assurance, truly, to think of marriage with such
girls, two penniless mates of a chartered emigrant ship, for that
was all the <i>Lucretia</i> was; but if matters had been well
ordered and we had not both fixed our fancy on the one maid, they
might have bad worse husbands in a new country than Holmer and
myself.</p>

<p>The just-settled port of Fremantle was a strange eight in
1829, when we dropped anchor there. The newly-arrived settlers,
for some half dozen vessels had arrived before us, were encamped
on both banks of the river, at the mouth of which the town was to
be built. They lived in tents and all manner of makeshift
shelters; and handsome furniture stood about, being rapidly
spoiled by exposure.</p>

<p>As we did not commence discharging at once, Holmer and I had
time to go ashore, and one way and another we got Mr. Bonner and
the girls shipshape, and much more comfortable than most of the
others were, I had heard about Sydney and Port Jackson, and
somehow I thought to find this new place just the same, and so
did all the importunate people who came out.</p>

<p>Well, we soon had to turn to discharging into whatever boats
we could get beside our own, and there was no more shore-work,
except when we could get away after dark, but Holmer had the ear
of the chief mate, and nearly always managed that I should have
to stop on board. But for all that I had succeeded in distancing
him in Mary Bonner's affections, and he knew it. From that time
his behavior to me was intolerable, and it's a wonder that I did
not half kill him and desert my ship. He had told Mr. Bonner that
I was tine only son of a common sailor, and while at sea my
acquaintance could not be well avoided; on shore, his daughters
should not recognise me.</p>

<p>Bonner was a disappointed man; the discomforts of the voyage,
the difference in the condition of the colony to what he had been
led to expect, had soured his temper, and he intimated to his
daughters that he wished them to discourage any intimacy with me.
But he was too late.</p>

<p>In those days of comparative freedom from conventionalities,
restraint was difficult to exercise, and in spite of father and
jealous rival, Mary and I had come to an understanding. In this
we were favored by her sister Kate, who had formed a romantic and
unrequited attachment for Holmer. I could bear with, him better
now, knowing that I was successful; and my dream of deserting my
ship and working my way in the new colony changed to a more
ambitious prospect of entering the East India Company's service
on our arrival alt Calcutta, where we were bound next, by way of
Singapore. The time came for us to sail, and I managed to get
leave ashore for a while, and meet my sweetheart to say good-bye.
She told me that her father thought of returning as soon as he
had secured his title to the land, to which his coming, and the
property he had imported entitled him. She gave me the address of
an aunt in England in case they returned, and we were bidding
each other a lingering farewell when Kate hastily warned us that
her father and Holmer were approaching.</p>

<p>I stood my ground, for I was not going to slink off as though
I was a criminal. Banner's voice echoed his displeasure, when he
coldly accosted me and bade me farewell; but Holmer's chagrin got
the better of his discretion, and he roughly demanded what I was
doing ashore.</p>

<p>I told him that I had leave from the captain; to which, he
answered that he did not believe me, and ordered me to go aboard
at once and send the boat back for him. He spoke meaning to
provoke me, and be succeeded. I replied that I should go on board
when my time was up, not before, upon which he caught me by the
shoulder, and pushed me roughly forward, saying that I was a
common, insolent dog, and he would have me put in irons if I did
not obey him at once.</p>

<p>Now, no man can stand being hectored before his sweetheart,
and I returned Mr. Holmer the compliment between the eyes and
knocked him down. Bonner protested loudly against such ruffianly
conduct on my part; and Mary came and stood beside me, and took
my hand, flushed and defiant. Altogether there seemed the
prospect of a pretty row. Holmer got up, and a man does not look
at his best when he is picking himself up after being knocked
down. Kate looked at him eagerly, as though expecting him to fly
at me like a tiger; but he did nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>'I will settle accounts with this fellow on board,' he said to
Bonner. 'I am afraid I forgot myself for a moment,' he went on,
bowing to the girls.</p>

<p>Bonner called his daughters, and turned away with Holmer, and
Kate slowly followed. Mary remained for a moment with me.</p>

<p>'Shall you get into trouble?' she asked, as she nestled in my
embrace. Poor girl! She had visions of yard-arming and other
dreadful punishments; but I reassured her that the easy
discipline of the merchant service did not take note of a quarrel
ashore between two mates, and that where Holmer was concerned I
was quite able to take care of myself&mdash;a remark which was
entirely unfounded, as the sequel shows.</p>

<p>We parted there, in the bright moonlight, on the bank of the
Swan River, with the camp fires of the motley crowd of emigrants
glimmering and flickering around. I went on board, and sent the
boat back for Holmer, who had a very pretty pair of black eyes
the next morning. Nothing more was said of the scuffle between
us. The skipper was a rough, easy-going old man, who would have
told Holmer to put up his hands in a row, and not come paying out
slack to him; and so the matter dropped, and Holmer and I only
spoke on duty.</p>

<p>Six days out we ran into a howling gale from the nor'-west, a
regular hurricane at times, that beat us remorselessly on to the
barren coast to leeward. We were only in ballast, and light at
that, so we had a poor chance from the outset, and when on the
second day we saw during the lifts in the rain squalls a line of
breakers, ever growing nearer, we began to think of our
prayers.</p>

<p>We could not carry on any canvas worth speaking of, the fury
of the wind was too great, and we were being tossed towards the
shore as a mere plaything, awaiting the inevitable crash.</p>

<p>'Your eyes are sharp, Roger,' said the old man to me as we
hung on and gazed at our approaching doom. 'See if you can make
out a bit of beach just to nor'ard of that black point. I keep
fancying I see a stretch.'</p>

<p>The beating, driving rain eased off for a moment and I saw the
strip the skipper meant, and told him so.</p>

<p>'We must go for it, then, and the higher up we get the better
chance to save our long-boat. Go aft and give a hand, and make
yourself mighty fast, for we'll ship some snorters directly.'</p>

<p>I understood him, and crawled aft to join the two men at the
wheel, lashing myself as securely as I could. I watched the
skipper's signal. He lifted his disengaged hand, and we let her
fall off. As the wind caught us, the jib went flying to leeward
as lightly as a lady's pocket-handkerchief thrown overboard, and
sea after sea came sweeping on board. Our staysail&mdash;all we
had left&mdash;stood to us bravely, and straining every nerve the
two men and I; our eyes fixed on the beach, strove to keep her
head on for it. It seemed but a minute from the time we got her
round before the gale and the instant when we were thrown down a
bound and struggling heap amid a rain of falling spars and
tangled rigging.</p>

<p>One incident only I remember of that anxious race. One of the
men with me incautiously looked behind during that short flight.
The look of horror that came into his face I shall never forget,
and he seemed to crouch within himself. I knew what he saw, and
did not follow his example, but, strange to say, he was the one
killed of us three by a falling spar, and the scared look on his
face died with him.</p>

<p>The sudden cessation of motion told us that we had succeeded
in beaching the poor <i>Lucretia</i> in her last port, and we
proceeded to disentangle our bruised and stiffened limbs and look
about us. We had been thrown well up on the beach and our
forepart was comparatively safe, and to that we made our way
amongst the tangled, wreckage that cumbered the deck. One by one
the remnant of the crew gathered on the fo'csle, and we found
that ten of us were alive and comparatively sound.</p>

<p>The skipper was badly hurt, and we found him buried under a
heap of wreckage. We got him out still alive, and be made eleven.
They were, the wounded captain, Holmer, myself, the boatswain,
cook, and six sailors. The chief mate and the others had either
been washed overboard, or killed by the fall of the masts and
yards when we struck.</p>

<p>We got ashore easily, and carried the captain back to a belt
of low stunted trees growing above high-water mark. Here we
settled ourselves in the best shelter we could find, and the
boatswain and cook and a couple of men went back to try and get
some food.</p>

<p>I busied myself tending the captain's hurts. The others broke
down some boughs and made a bit of a screen to keep the driving
scud off, and Holmer sat moodily under a tree doing nothing.
Presently the provision party came back with a good load of
stores, and the welcome tidings that the long-boat was apparently
uninjured, and could be launched when the weather moderated. This
was good news, for I, for one, had made sure that the boat could
not possibly have escaped injury or destruction from the ruinous
fall of the spars.</p>

<p>The mainmast, however, had stood the shock, the main topmast
only being carried away. The cook had managed to get some dry
chip wood and flint and steel and tinder, so we made a fire, and
after a good feed and some rum and coffee felt comparatively
comfortable.</p>

<p>The captain too revived a little, and the pounding of the surf
smote harmlessly on our ears, for we were safe ashore, sleeping
the sleep of tired and wearied men.</p>

<p>Next morning the weather was clear, bright and beautiful. The
gale had blown itself out, and the sea was rapidly going, down,
so after breakfasts we turned to with a will to clear away the
longboat. She was well found, and with fine weather and a
continuance of the nor'-west winds we ought to make Fremantle
easily in a week.</p>

<p>The work went on merrily that day, and even the sullen Holmer
seemed to regain his spirits, though be still kept the same evil
front towards me. During the day we recovered two bodies and
buried them in the sand. One was the chief mate, and Holmer said
to one of the sailors as they stood regarding it, not knowing
that I was within bearing, 'See how the sea takes a
d&mdash;&mdash;d good fellow like that and leaves a swab like
Osborne alive.'</p>

<p>I excused him because the first mate had been his friend, and
I was not, but it showed me how he nursed his hatred, and what I
bad to expect from him if ever be got a chance. The next day a
party of natives turned up, but they did not appear hostile, nor
very anxious to approach us, but their coming, I am convinced,
put the devilish idea into Holmer's head which he afterwards
carried out.</p>

<p>The captain continued to improve, the weather remained
settled, and the boat would soon be ready to start. One evening
Homier came in to camp and said to the captain, who was now able
to sit up, that it would be as well to send a party out back a
short distance to see what the country was like, so that we could
report upon it to the authorities at Fremantle, as they were very
anxious to learn all they could about the new possession.</p>

<p>The skipper thought well of the idea and agreed to it so a
party was made up to go a day's march back from the sea and to
return another course. The party consisted of Holmer, myself, and
two men. The first part of the day's journey was very fatiguing,
as the country was sandy and heavy, but presently we caught sight
of a range and made for that and got on better country. We
reached the range at sunset, and found it not so high as we had
expected, and agreed to ascend it the first thing in the
morning, and take the bearings of any striking landmarks.</p>

<p>We passed a quiet night, and in the morning Holmer with one
man, I with the other, made our way up two peaks of the range,
not very far apart. From the top of the peak I was on not much
was visible but dark forest country, and a distant range. There
was but little to do, so I told the man to go down to our camp
and begin to get the things together for our return march.</p>

<p>Then I sat down on a rock and commenced, marking the direction
of any few points I could see. I finished my work, and was lost
in a day dream, thinking of seeing Mary Bonner again so soon,
when I felt myself seized and violently flung forward, so that I
fell on my face with my head down the slope of the hill. The next
minute someone was kneeling 'on me, and Holmer's voice said, 'Got
you at last, my friend. Now you'll just stop in this smiling
paradise, while I sail away to Fremantle and marry pretty Mary.
She'll soon forget a tar-barrel like you, particularly, when I
tell her some nice tales about you. Ha! you'd try it on would
you? Take that!'</p>

<p>I had made a furious struggle, and with the word, be gave me a
blow on the head that stunned me.</p>

<p>It was past mid-day when I came to my wits again, and then I
was dazed and my head ached badly. Gradually I collected my
senses together. Holmer's game was plain enough. He would go back
with the men, two dull-witted fellows, and report that I bad been
killed by the natives. Then the long-boat, now ready, would sail
away and I was doomed to linger here in the wilderness. It was a
refined piece of revenge, worse than killing me outright.</p>

<p>I understood that my only chance was in hastening back.
Perhaps, something might detain the beat. I rose and staggered
down the hill, but I rapidly got worse, and by the time I reached
the base of the bill I had to sit down and rest. I persevered,
however, throughout the night, and early the next morning I
reached the sea, faint and exhausted.</p>

<p>But, imagine my dismay to find no sign of my comrades. The
wreck, the boat, our camp, had all disappeared, and I realised
with despair in my heart that I had wandered, off my course
during the night, and come to the beach in a different place.</p>

<p>I was lost, and could not tell whether I was north or south of
the scene of the wreck. I wearied myself searching, but: the
place seemed to have utterly disappeared, and at last I threw
myself down to die.</p>

<p>I was aroused by voices, hearty, and familiar voices, and lay
for a moment thinking that I was awaking from a nightmare, and
that I was back in our camp, and bad only dreamt that I was a
lost and abandoned outcast; then I came to my senses fully, and
recognised the voices, and leaped to my feet.</p>

<p>The longboat was passing by, close inshore. There was scarcely
enough wind to fill the sails, and the men had the oars out, end
were pulling easy and talking. I had wandered to the shore some
miles to the south of the camp, and under a mistaken notion that
I was north of it, had gone still further south. The start had
been delayed, and the wind being so light the boat had come
slowly along, and I was saved.</p>

<p>They shouted back to me when I shouted, and pulled quickly to
the beach, where I met them.</p>

<p>Their wonderment at seeing me was great, for Holmer had told a
most circumstantial story about seeing me attacked and killed by
the natives, and having himself escaped by a mere chance. He had
appeared to the two men who went with ms, for he, too, like me,
had sent his man back, excited, and spent with running, and now
he stood there a convicted liar, guilty of the unpardonable crime
of deserting a shipmate.</p>

<p>They had landed, and made the boat fast while they stood
around and listened to my tale. There was silence when I had
finished.</p>

<p>Holmer broke it with a savage oath. Addressing me, he said,
'Curse you; the sea won't have you; and the desert gives you back
again; but it's not over yet.'</p>

<p>The captain spoke. He was now fast recovering, and as I said
before he was a rough, easy-going man, but one who when roused
would act.</p>

<p>'You acknowledge your guilt, then, Holmer?'</p>

<p>'Yes; I acknowledge that I meant to leave him behind to give
him a lesson. You all know, that there is bad blood between us.
It is no business of yours; the quarrel is between, us only; else
I should have reported it to you when he struck his superior
officer.'</p>

<p>'We have been through peril of our lives together,' went on
the old man, while we listened in astonishment at hearing him
speak thus; 'and should agree together, and help one another if
only out of gratitude to the power who saved our lives. Instead
of that, you contemplated murder. Are we a set of bloody pirates
or honest seamen? Bury your quarrel, and shake hands.'</p>

<p>Feeling, as the captain said, full of gratitude for my own
wonderful rescue, I stepped forward, but Holmer sullenly turned
away.</p>

<p>'You refuse,' said the skipper; 'then remain here. We will
have no Jonah on board.'</p>

<p>'No, by God!' repeated the boatswain. 'No Jonah on board with
shipwrecked sailors.'</p>

<p>And a hoarse grumble went round, 'No Jonah aboard.'</p>

<p>'Do you mean to maroon me?' demanded Holmer.</p>

<p>'There is plenty of provision on the wreck, and when we reach
Fremantle we will notify your position, and the northern ships
will keep a lookout, and if you keep a signal flying you will
soon be found.'</p>

<p>Holmer turned fiercely on me. 'Fight it out now, and here,
and let he who loses remain.'</p>

<p>The boatswain stepped forward before I could answer.</p>

<p>'That's a noble offer, ain't it; to fight a man with a clout
on the head who's been wandering around without bite or drink.
Now, look here, Mr. Holmer, the captain's said his say; and,
whether he alters his mind or not, we're not a-going to alter
ours, and we say you're not a-coming with us in that long boat;
that's flat. You'll do well enough back at the wreck till some
barky picks you off; and that won't be long for two or three were
going to come up this way when we left.'</p>

<p>A glance around at the faces of the men showed that against
this sentence there was no appeal. The captain and I were
powerless. The doomed man met his fate with stubborn courage; and
turned away that none should see his face, and commenced to walk
firmly towards, the wreck. As if his absence brought good luck, a
fresh breeze rippled the water. We hurried into the boat, and
cast her off. The sails filled, and I, a late despairing
castaway, was heading back to life and my love.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
I PUT down my pen when I had reached thus far in transcribing
the story that my father had told me, his son, Giles Osborne,
just before he died. I looked out of the window into the still
and quiet night. All was silent and dark, but far away one light
twinkled as if some man as restless as myself was watching, and
could not see the path clear before him. I wish I had known my
father's story sooner; the way would be clear then. Now it is
dark, all dark.</p>

<h3>PART 2. -- MY FATHER'S STORY CONCLUDED.</h3>

<p class="first">
WE reached Fremantle easily and safely, and I had the joy of
seeing Mary once more. But, excepting from her, my welcome was
anything but cordial. From, the old man I expected nothing else,
but Kate, whose mind was warped in consequence of the passion
she cherished for Holmer, would bear of no justification, and
with all the want of fairness common to a woman when her feelings
are concerned, condemned the abandonment of Holmer as a wanton
and wicked murder.</p>

<p>Naturally, this made it very hard for me to obtain any stolen
meetings with Mary, and, altogether things looked bad. But I was
buoyed up by youth and hope, and trusted in the future. The
captain had, of course, notified the proper authorities, and
several shipmasters had promised to keep a look out, so there
seemed every chance of Holmer being soon picked up.</p>

<p>For us it was a bad prospect; the colony was depressed, and
many were leaving. There was no scarcity of sailors and others
willing to work their passages to get out of the place, and so I
looked in vain for a berth. Mr. Bonner was shortly leaving with
his family, and there was no inducement for me to stop at the
Swan River, for even food was getting short in the new
settlement, but it was rather a puzzle for a shipwrecked man, who
had pretty well lost what little he had, to get away.</p>

<p>Fortune favored me, however. A week after Mr. Bonner and his
family had left I met an old shipmate, now chief mate on a barque
going on to the eastern coast called New South Wales, to the
convict settlement at Port Jackson. By his good offices I got a
chance of working my passage over, and arrived in Sydney in
1828.</p>

<p>Sydney was little better than West Australia for a man without
money or friends, and there seemed fewer chances of getting a
ship than at Fremantle, for a great many vessels were then
arriving at the latter place.</p>

<p>After undergoing considerable hardship, I got employment on a
Government expedition, going into the interior exploring. It was
under the command of Captain Sturt, and was destined to find the
course of the River Murray, although I was not with them on that
glorious boat voyage, being left behind with the party who
remained at the depot camp at the Murrumbidgee.</p>

<p>I learnt bush experience, and got to know the pioneer
squatters, who were then following the river down. We were
disbanded on the return of our gallant leader, and I took to bush
life, and succeeded. During the years that followed I heard
several times from Mary Banner, and at last was able to write to
her and say that I had a home to bring her to, and was coming to
claim her; and I went.</p>

<p>Now, up to the time I landed in England t had heard nothing of
the fate of Holmer, nor had Mary, or she would have told me, but
when I arrived at Mary's home I found them steeped in grief.
Holmer had suddenly appeared in the quiet country town where they
resided, and renewed his acquaintance with them. He told Bonner,
who had always been friendly to him, that he had been picked up
by one of the vessels from Fremantle, and had since done well. He
did not trouble Mary, but he and Kate became affianced, and Mary
told me that she suspected that Holmer had some business with her
father of a speculative character that suddenly fell through.</p>

<p>Holmer was forbidden the house, and then Kate disappeared. A
week afterwards the house was broken into, and Bonner, who was
awakened, was attacked by the disturbed robbers, and badly hurt.
This was the state of affairs when I arrived, and Mary's father
was dying. I must hasten over these circumstances, and would not
detail them, but they are necessary for you to show, in order for
you to act wisely and justly. Old Bonner died, and by his will
Mary and Kate shared his wealth, which, with the realisation of
his West Australian land grants, was considerable.</p>

<p>Mary and I were married, for I could not leave her alone after
her father's death, but before we went we strove to find her
sister. We should not have succeeded, but Kate wrote to us
herself; and her sister went to see her. She had fled with
Holmer, and they were married, and now he was arrested and about
to stand his trial as an active member of a gang of robbers and
coiners.</p>

<p>She never told Mary what we both suspected, that it was Holmer
and his companions who had broken into Bonner's house and caused
his death, but I know now that it was he. Kate was still
infatuated with her husband, in spite of his villainy. She
accepted her share of the fortune, and it was in consequence of
her being able to spend money on his defence that he was not
hanged like his companions, but transported.</p>

<p>We left for Sydney, and Mary afterwards heard from her sister,
that she, too, had come to Sydney, and hoped to be able to get
her husband his liberty as her assigned servant. But we were up
on the Murrumbidgee, living a happy, peaceful life on our
station, when this happened. And I may as well say that Mrs
Whitton, which was the assumed name Holmer bore, was successful
in getting her husband assigned to her, and for four years he
enjoyed comparative freedom.</p>

<p>Then his evil nature asserted itself, and he got mixed up in a
low affray, in which a soldier was murdered. Holmer and another
escaped, and took to the bush, and became outlaws. Kate, doubly
widowed, secluded, herself as much as she could, and devoted
herself to the two children she now had&mdash;a boy and a
girl.</p>

<p>The years passed, and you, the youngest of our three, were not
born until we had been ten years on the Murrumbidgee, and the
station was then well in settled country, for others had gone far
beyond us. You were only a mere child when the great tragedy of
my life succeeded our first great sorrow! Your only sister died,
and soon afterwards a band of escaped convicts began to make
themselves dangerous in our neighborhood, and at last we mustered
together to hunt them down, and try and rid the country of
them.</p>

<p>They led us a long dance, and when we captured some of them we
found we had only got a few of the least dangerous, who had been
set to lure us away while they made a sweeping raid on the
stations. Mine was a special object of attack, and I returned to
find it pillaged, the buildings burnt, and my wife and eldest son
murdered. The few men and the boy&mdash;your brother&mdash;had
made a gallant defence, but the odds were too great, and only
that the woman who had nursed you fled and concealed herself, you
would nave been one of the victims.</p>

<p>The savage who led the outlaws was Holmer, and he left a
message with one of the men they spared, to me to say that he
would not rest until I, too, was killed. This murderous outrage
raised the whole country, and one by one the perpetrators were
shot, captured, and hanged. I devoted myself only to tracking
down Holmer, and I succeeded. After months of toil I found out
his retreat, and wounded and captured him single-handed. I wanted
him to die on the gallows, and he did. He was hanged as the
notorious Captain Fang.</p>

<p>Now, when I captured him, and had him securely bound, he told
me that when he was left on the shore of West Australia, he
found, before he was taken off, the wreck of an old Spanish ship,
and a considerable treasure, consisting of casks of <i>rix</i>
dollars. He kept this secret, but never could get enough money
together to secure a snip to go there and take it off.</p>

<p>That it was over this he had quarrelled with old Bonner, who
was going to advance him the money, put heard sufficient to
discredit him. He had robbed the house, but been disappointed.
The rest of his career was known to me. He had an illegitimate
son, the mother being a woman who had followed his fortunes
through good and ill. He cared nothing for the wife who had been
so devoted to him, and nothing for her children. But he was fond
of the boy, and wanted him to get the money. His death on the
scaffold would settle our long score of hatred; would I find out
his boy and tell him of the wreck and of a treasure, perhaps help
him to go there.</p>

<p>I did not promise, but said I would consider about it, and not
make any other use of it, accept to inform his descendants. I did
nothing in the matter, nor would I make up my mind what to
do.</p>

<p>The secret and money, if it was true, belonged rightly to
Kate's children, your cousins, yet by the father's wish is should
go to the bastard. I leave it to you to act in the matter, or not
as you determine. You will be well off, and can afford this time
to look these people up, for which I leave you what few hints I
know of to find them.</p>

<h3>PART 3. -- MY CONFESSION.</h3>

<p class="first">
THIS was the legacy left to me, and after much pondering, I
had determined to carry out the bequest, and acquaint both of
them, if I could find them, with the position. If they quarrelled
over it, what did it matter to me?</p>

<p>With this in view, I had come to Sydney to set on foot my
quest. I knew but little, excepting that my aunt had assumed her
rightful name of Holmer, and probably the illegitimate child went
by the name Whiddon.</p>

<p><br>
DAWN was breaking when I finished writing down what my father
bad told me; and, thinking a long walk would refresh me, I left
the house in the suburb where I resided and strolled towards the
city. It was still early when I reached there, the lagging
night-birds were yet loitering about before slinking away to
their hiding places, and some of them came and whined to me for
alms. I gave one some silver, a man prematurely grey with the
look of a broken-down gentleman about him, and, as he turned
away, to seek one of the public houses just opening, a quick step
came up level with me, and a brisk, sharp voice said: 'Excuse
me, sir, no offence, but indiscriminate charity is the worst
possible thing; it encourages half the poverty we see.'</p>

<p>I felt inclined to answer him sharply that it was no business
of his, but looked at him before speaking, and what I saw amused
me.</p>

<p>He was a clean-shaven, well-dressed man, about my own age, or
a little older, with the most self-complacent smirk I ever saw on
a man's face.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he continued, seeing that I was not annoyed by his
freedom, 'gentlemen like you, easy-going, with money in your
pockets, give us more work to do than anything. Now, if you
supported well-conducted charitable institutions, and placed what
money you can afford in the proper hands, it would reach the
deserving poor, and not be squandered by the loafing vagabond
class.'</p>

<p>'Are you connected with the police?' I asked.</p>

<p>'No, I am an active organiser and collector for some of our
principal charitable institutions. It is in connection with that
I am out so early.'</p>

<p>He glanced curiously at me, as If wondering what brought me
out with the milk.</p>

<p>'Well,' I replied, 'this cut-and-dried sort of charity may be
all very well, but, for my part, I should think that a poor devil
would be more grateful for a shilling or two spontaneously given
than the same money doled out to him, accompanied with a
lecture.'</p>

<p>'Quite a mistake, sir. But a very common one, I know. Take
that man you just relieved. I know him well. Good education, and
a qualified lawyer at one time. Drink brought him down with a
run; struck off the rolls, and now a common loafer. That's his
story; he'll get boozed if you gave him enough, and pass to-night
in the lockup. There you are, you see argument right into my
hands.'</p>

<p>'I can't argue on the subject, because it's a matter of
feeling. I felt rather interested in that man's face. Cannot any
of your societies help him?'</p>

<p>'Bad case; been tried. His name's Holmer. Old mother spent her
all on him; lady by birth, and tried to make, him a gentleman;
now she's blind, and daughter supports her by washing, charring,
and odd jobs.'</p>

<p>I looked at the man with astonishment that I quickly hid. 'Do
you know where the mother lives?'</p>

<p>'Got it down on our books; send address to you if you like to
do anything.'</p>

<p>'I should be much obliged if you would; here's any card.'</p>

<p>He looked at it.</p>

<p>'Very well, Mr. Osborne. Here's my name. If you feel disposed
to contribute to any of the charities mentioned there, I'm your
man.'</p>

<p>He gave me a businesslike-looking card, and, bidding me good
morning, went rapidly down a cross street.</p>

<p>On his card was written '<i>G. Rumsey Whiddon, charitable
organiser and collector of</i>&mdash;', then followed the names
of several societies.</p>

<p>I stood aghast; but I had travelled too much not to know that
the singular coincidences of life are sometimes too startling not
to be true. Had I met both the men I was in search of, the
half-brothers, on one and the same morning?</p>

<p>I turned back to see if I could find the wreck of the lawyer,
Holmer, my cousin. He came right out of a public-house door
almost on the top of me, and tried to sneak past; but I stopped
him. The drink had put a little courage in him. When he found
that I did not read him a lecture on intemperance he explained to
me the conspiracy that existed in the world through envy of his
undoubted talents, and I listened quietly as I watched him, and
saw that he was hopeless. To tell him that I was perhaps his
cousin would saddle me with a needy loafer, and I left him,
feeling sure that he was the man.</p>

<p>Rumsey Whiddon, as I found he was generally known, sent me the
address of my unfortunate aunt. I found her in a squalid suburb,
alone, her daughter being out at work. She was sitting in a front
room, and sharply demanded who was there on hearing my step.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Holmer,' I said, 'my name is Giles Osborne, and I have
come to see if I can be of any assistance to you in your old age.
I am your nephew.'</p>

<p>'Osborne!' she cried, putting her hands up. 'No, No; they are
all dead. You are not the son of Roger Osborne? How can you
be?'</p>

<p>She put her hands before her face, as though she could still
see, and rocked herself, moaning.</p>

<p>'What are you saying to mother?' said a woman's voice, and the
daughter entered. She had not fallen as low as her brother, but
there was a look of the streets and the slums in her appearance.
'She gets bad at times,' she went on, 'and talks nonsense about
horrible things. What's your name, sir?'</p>

<p>I told her that I was a relation, and had called to see if I
could be of any assistance. Her manner changed, and she became
voluble in abuse of her mother and a recital of their hardships.
The old blind mother only moaned and muttered to herself. I did
not stop long, but for reasons of my own told the woman not to
say anything of my visit to her brother. To this she eagerly
assented. Evidently she did not wish him to share any luck that
was impending. I gave her money, and left. I had one more visit
to pay, and that was to Ramsey Whiddon.</p>

<p>Was he the man or not? He was quite open&mdash;told me that he
knew nothing of his father, but his mother was still alive, and
would be very glad to receive a visit from me.</p>

<p>I found her living in a comfortable house, and in full
possession of her faculties&mdash;a much younger woman than my
wretched aunt, of whose existence, to do her justice, she knew
nothing. When I explained who I was she was perfectly frank in
her communications. She could not understand my reason for
wanting to furnish the son of the man who had killed my mother
and brother with any valuable information, but accepted it as
true.</p>

<p>From her loose style of conversation I learnt that Rumsey
found the charity game pay, and was well looked-on by the
promoters of the charities. Of course, I had guessed that he was
a humbug. Well, my mission would be soon accomplished, and I
could at once wash my hands of the whole hateful business. I was
disgusted with what I had found&mdash;the drunken, dishonest
lawyer and his half-vicious sister, and the smug hypocrite, with
his comfortable, vulgar mother. My poor, half-demented aunt alone
excited any real compassion.</p>

<p>I need not dwell on my explanations with the whole crew. I
finally made arrangements with the half-brothers to accompany
them and locate the wreck, and if the treasure was there, would
assist them to secure it. Meanwhile I would undertake to provide
for Mrs. Holmer and her daughter.</p>

<p>Whiddon promised to devote himself to keeping his half-brother
sober.</p>

<p>I meed not go into the precautions adopted by me to get to the
locality with our motive unsuspected. It was tolerably easy,
under the plea of inspecting some country. The instructions were
true, and we found the old wreck still the same as when the dead
bushranger had discovered it. The timbers lay in an inlet that
led into a salt-water lagoon that the high tide filled.</p>

<p>The ship had been wrecked on an outer reef of rooks, end
finally the hull had been swept in to where it found its final
resting-place. At high tide the wreck was under water; at low
tide it was nearly bare; and the tide on that part of the coast
was a pretty high one. Whiddon, who was an ingenious fellow,
showed me how, with the timber that was still sound, and rocks,
we could build, a sea-wall across a gap that gave access to the
tide. A reef only covered during spring tides protected the wreck
elsewhere.</p>

<p>We set to work at it, and in a few days had it completed, the
gap not being large. We could not, of course, make it quite
waterproof, but the leakage was inconsiderable. Then, the two set
to work to empty the casks. I did not afford them much
assistance, for, being a lover of botany, I devoted some time to
that. I did not intend to take any of the treasure. I had enough
without.</p>

<p>One day I strolled down to the wreck of the <i>Lucretia</i>,
and on returning, lay down to rest under a clump of trees at the
back of the tent. Whiddon and Holmer came up from working at the
wreck, and laid themselves down for a smoke inside the tent,
without seeing me.</p>

<p>Presently they began to talk; and I overheard the following
conversation:</p>

<p>'What do you think, Rumsey? Won't that fellow Osborne want a
share of this after all?'</p>

<p>'Tain't much to divide. If it had been gold it would have been
different. But I've got an idea. Now, you're a lawyer. Answer me
this. Osborne has no relations but you and your sister and
mother. If he croaks, who does his property descend to?'</p>

<p>'His next-of-kin if he's made no will.'</p>

<p>'That's you?'</p>

<p>'Yes; undoubtedly.'</p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>Whiddon got up and looked around, but the tent concealed me.
'I vote that he does croak, and, as I'm your half-brother, you'll
be generous and go halves. With his property and this little
swag, I reckon we shall be set up.'</p>

<p>'Accidents are very common in places like this. I don't see
why an accident should not happen,' returned Holmer.</p>

<p>'You understand, and you're with me, then?'</p>

<p>'I am.'</p>

<p>'Shouldn't wonder if that accident happened to-night.'</p>

<p>'More should I. Shake hands on it.'</p>

<p>Some more talk followed, and then they got up and went back to
their work. My death was arranged for.</p>

<p>I sat and pondered over what I should do, and then a sense of
justice took possession of me. I had found these men out and put
fortune in their way when I owed them nothing but a debt of
vengeance. In return they plotted against my life. I felt that,
like their common father, these men would become a scourge to
society!</p>

<p>My murder would lead to more and more, as their bloodstained
money was spent. I arose perfectly determined, and conscious only
of a strong sense of duty. I felt myself to be merely an
instrument in the hands of a just fate. With my rifle on my arm,
I walked down to the wreck, calmly and quietly. They were busy
down below, and did not see me until I stood on a plank and
called to them.</p>

<p>They started and looked up, and I covered them.</p>

<p>'Holmer! my blood-thirsty cousin, and you, his half-brother,
are sons of your father; I heard your talk just now, but instead
of an accident happening to me, one will happen to you.'</p>

<p>They looked at me with their white faces&mdash;they who talked
so coolly of murdering me&mdash;and Whiddon stammered, 'It was
only a joke, Osborne!'</p>

<p>'So is this,' I replied, as I sent a ball through his
head.</p>

<p>Holmer fell on his knees and commenced sobbing and praying to
me piteously. It was mercy to put him out of his abject fright,
and I did so. Then I turned away, feeling neither compunction nor
regret for the deed; and as I did so I heard a crash.</p>

<p>It was a high tide, with a westerly wind blowing, and the
sea-wall we had built gave way and the waves came leaping,
bounding in with a rush that nearly caught me in their hungry
grasp. There the two men and the <i>rix</i>-dollars rest under
the waves together, and I still think I was right.</p>

<h2><a id="ch22"></a>22. -- HOW WE SLEWED OLD STONEY</h2>

<h3><i>As by "Dramingo"</i></h3>

<h3><i>Queenslander</i>, Brisbane, 23 March 1872</h3>

<p class="first">"WELL, you wouldn't think it, would you? but
this here horse cost me fifty pounds."</p>

<p>"Must have been a bad debt you took him for."</p>

<p>"Well no it wasn't a bad debt; but I'll just tell you how it
was. Were you ever on the Bluefly?"</p>

<p>"No; can't say I was."</p>

<p>"Don't you ever go there then? I was living down that way and
raised a pretty good cheque, and like an &mdash;&mdash;, must go
and swamp it at Old Stoney's&mdash;he keeps a pub at the
crossing. His real name's Sucker, but everybody calls him 'Old
Stoney.'</p>

<p>"Well, I knocked down every sixpence, and got a bit in his
books, too; so, as he had some colts to break, the old sinner
offered me a job there for a bit, just to pay himself; not out of
any favor he had for me. He was a bit of a cockatoo squatter was
Stoney, had a few head of cattle scattered over the neighboring
runs, and used to make as much fuss sending to musters and
looking after them as if they had been newly imported; and well
he might, for you never knew such cattle to breed as they
were.</p>

<p>"I stopped with Stoney a matter of three or four month, and if
ever one man treated another mean he did me."</p>

<p>"After you with that match.&mdash;Thanks!</p>

<p>"If ever there was a shout on he would try and get me left
out, even though he lost the shilling by doing it, or serve me
out a nobbler from a bottle of cold tea he used to keep for his
own drinking whenever he was asked.</p>

<p>"'Brandy for you, Jim?' he'd say; and at first, before I
dropped to it, I'd have it swallowed, but of course he only
played me that trick once or twice. All this made me hate the
very sight of him, but I was as deep in his debt as ever.</p>

<p>"He had a nephew who used to help him about the place, a
down-looking customer. Some people said he was a closer relation,
and he was like the old chap. No doubt on that point. He and this
kiddy used often to go out for two or three days at a stretch.
First I did not notice it much, but latterly I used to think
there was something up.</p>

<p>"One day they came home after being away three or four
days.</p>

<p>"'Been into One-horse township, 'bout eighty miles away,' so
they said.</p>

<p>"Next morning old Stoney says to me, 'Jim, just you take the
Kid and old Stumpy and go over to Ooloo for some sugar.' I
thought it pretty good that they should have just come from the
township and not brought some with them, but being about half
screwed didn't puzzle much over the matter just then. Ooloo was a
station belonging to some company or other, 'bout fifteen or
twenty miles away. The station on the other side was about the
same distance, or a little bit further p'raps. It belonged to an
old fellow called 'Lookee-there-now,' because if anything went
wrong&mdash;and he was a scotty old soul&mdash;he would let
nothing out of him but that, and he would keep on at it. You'd
think at a distance he was swearing at the rate of a hunt.</p>

<p>"His real name was Swinkle; he used to brand with an S on the
rump, and a half ha'penny out of the ear, both on the off-side.
Now, the company used to brand: circle on near rump, swallow-tail
ear-mark. And old Stoney used to brand S in circle, top off
off-ear, a regular crop. You'll see by-and-by what I'm telling
you all about the brands for.</p>

<p>"I catches Kid and Stumpy and starts. This Kid was one of the
colts I had broke in, and as wicked a brute as ever I backed;
he'd go off with you as quiet as a lamb, and all of a sudden, if
he thought he had you, he'd start and buck a town down. 'Twas
nearly all ranges between the Bluefly and Ooloo, and I suppose I
had gone about ten miles or so, not so much I dare say, when I
struck a match for a smoke, and, not thinking what I was a doing
of, let the reins drop on the Kid's neck. At it he went directly,
and very soon hoisted me as high as a county cabin. The old
pack-horse stood stock still like a brick, and when I picked
myself up I soon caught him, but the Kid was about a hundred
yards away going in a docker with the saddle; he couldn't sling
it though, and after a bit he set off. The saddle was my own, the
only bit of property I had left in the world, and I didn't see
the fun of losing it, so I clambered on to old
Stumpy&mdash;luckily I had a riding saddle to pack the sugar sack
on&mdash;and started after my beauty. Stumpy didn't go very fast;
but by working my passage pretty well, I managed to keep sight of
the Kid. He was making straight for the range, and after going
through some pretty broken country, I got close to him on the
bank of a creek, just where a cattle track crowd, and as I went
along I noticed fresh tracks on it. In he went into the creek,
but instead of crossing he turned and followed the bed up. On we
went for a bit, and presently I saw we were coming to a regular
gorge. Thinks I to myself, you're blocked now, my chicken, but he
still kept on, clattering over the stones, and in amongst the
oaks and tea trees, till I lost sight of him altogether, for the
old horse waa getting pretty nearly done. We were now right in
amongst the hills, and I knew he was bound to follow the bed of
the creek, so I had nothing for it but keep going ahead. All the
way, I kept on noticing fresh cattle tracks, and wondering what
oould have brought cattle into such a shop. After overing some
pretty rough boulders, just where the gorge began to get precious
narrow, I caught sight of my noble Kid standing atill, and a bit
of a brush fence across the bed of the creek.</p>

<p>"Well, this slewed me altogether, and after catching the
brute, which I did after a bit of trouble, I looked about and
fonnd a slip-pannel. In I went and soon the country opened out,
and I got on a good plain cattle track. Well, there was as pretty
a little pocket up amongst them hills as ever you'd wish to ace.
There was a yard, with a good crush in it, too, and a bit of a
hut. I shoved the mokes in the yard, and went down to the hut to
explore. The door was locked, but I found a loose slab and got
in. A couple of bunks, a table, and some rations in bags; but
that wasn't what I wanted. I looked under one of the bunks and
there were the articles I was looking for, an S brand and a
circle brand. I heard some cattle singing out while I was poking
about the hut, and went up the creek to have a look at them. I
saw a mob of about thirty, all young things between two and three
years old, freshly branded&mdash;that is to say, part of the
brand was fresh. Some had a fresh S put inside the old circle
brand, and others had a circle put over the old S, and all their
eara were freshly cropped. I saw by the tracks there were more
cattle about, but didn't wait any longer as it was getting late.
I got to Ooloo that night, but didn't let on a word of what I had
seen, for I had not made up my mind exactly how to work it.</p>

<p>"I went home the next day, and who should I see drinking in
the bar but an old mate of mine, and the very man for the game I
meant to play. Old Stoney asked me how it was I didn't come home
the night before, but I spun him a yarn about the bores getting
away and knocking up that satisfied him. Than I got Jack outside
and just told him all about it. Well, he was on the game like a
bird at once; but not in quite the way I would have liked to get
even with old Stoney, but I yielded to Jack, and together we soon
had it all out and dried.</p>

<p>"We strolled into the bar, and Jack asked me to have a drink.
Then we commenoed. I asked him what he was a doing of, and he
said:</p>

<p>"Oh! he was having a look round. He had a few head of cattle
coming up the road behind, and he came to see if there wae any
sale for them. Old Stoney cocked his ears at this, and began
asking all manner of questions about the cattle, 'cause he was
allers on for buying travelling cattle, so as to get plenty of
brands; he could claim most anything then that came his way.
Well, my mate said he had bought the cattle at a pound sale, but
was short of money and would be glad to sell the lot cheap. After
a good deal of barneying old Stoney said be bad a little money to
invest, and offered thirty shillings, but Jack wouldn't hear of
it, and at last got him to bid two pounds; Jack said he had fifty
head, and stuck out like a man for two ten, but in the end they
fixed it at two ponuds a head. Jack then said he would like me to
come back and give him a hand to fetch them on, as the man he had
with him wanted to leave. Old Stoney agreed, and we started after
dinner, not back to any cattle, but up to the pocket to do a
little mustering on our own account.</p>

<p>"Now, Thursday was mail day. Old Swinkle and the company's
super used often to come in themselves about dinner time to get
the mails, with their letters and Queenslanders. Well, Jack said
we would be up with the cattle, about the time the mail came up,
and on Thursday morning we were there. Just before we got to
Stoney's yard, who should come with the mailman but a couple of
traps,* going up the country on some lay. One of them was not
used to riding, and they were going to spell that day. Nothing
could have happened better; we had the cattle in the yard before
Btoney knew anything about it; there were the two bobbies
lounging on the verandah, and in an hour or two you oould bet on
old 'Lookee-there-now' and the company's man being up. We had
managed to muster up fifty with the brands on them hot and fresh,
for Stoney had meant giving it ever, so had gone in for a big
haul the last time. We had brought the brands with us too, so we
had him right. Jack rides down to the house, and I stopped at the
yard.</p>

<p class="footnote">* <i>Mounted policemen.</i></p>

<p>"'Will you oome and have a look at the cattle, Mr. Sucker,'
says Jack.</p>

<p>"'All right,' says Stoney; 'I'll be there directly.' And
presently up he comes. When he saw those cattle I think he was
the sickliest looking live man I ever saw in my life. He didn't
know what to say or how to aay it. He looks at me, and if he had
bad something handy I believe he would have finished me, but I
only laughed, and shook one of the brands at him. After gathering
his wits a little he apoke, and asked us what the devil we meant
by meddling with his cattle; that he'd call the bobbies and give
us in charge.</p>

<p>"It was all blow of course, so we told him to call away, and
when he saw things were getting serious he began to draw in hia
horna, and tried all manner of dodges to get me away from the
slip-rails; but I wouldn't move, and vowed the first man who
tried to shift me would feel the weight of an S brand. So he saw
it waa a case, and agreed to pay us the two pound a head for the
cattle. Had be not done so we would have kept them in the yard
till one of the real owners came, and he knew better than we did
that he daren't stand a prosecution. The fact is, I wanted the
owners to get their cattle. Jack went down to get the money, and
I stopped at the yard till it was right. Presently Jack comes up
with my dunnage rolled up, and a cheque for a hundred on the bank
at Mudflat township.</p>

<p>"So off we started at once, but were not well out of sight, so
I heard afterwards, before up came both old Swinkle and the super
of Ooloo. The blessed bobbies had been stuck in the verandah
looking at us all the time, but of course didn't know what was
up, and had no curiosity to come down and look at a mob of
cattle. I was riding an old horse of Jack's&mdash;this very
identical animal I have now; so after we got past the station,
Jack says to me, 'Look here, Jim, I doubt old Stoney will be
playing some tricks about this cheque if he can get down before
us, that old horse don't get along very quick, so if you like
I'll just push on ahead and get it cashed. You can come down
easy.'</p>

<p>"It was a hundred and seventy miles to the Muddy, and I
thought 'twas the best thing to be done, for I knew the old
sinner to be as full of tricks as a dingo, so said yes. I had
known Jack a long time, and had no suspicion of him. He said he'd
wait for me at the Royal, and we parted.</p>

<p>"In about five days I got down. I went to the Royal and
inquired for Jack.</p>

<p>"'Oh! Yes,' says the barman, 'he was here right enough. Went
away to New Zealand in the steamer that left yesterday
morning.'</p>

<p>"'Gone,' says I. 'Did he leave no message for me. My name's
Jim Soft.</p>

<p>"'Ah! I remember,' says the fellow, grinning like a Cheshire
cat, 'he told me to tell you to be very careful of the horse for
him, and he'd give you that money you know of, next time he saw
you, or if he didn't see you soon, he might send it.'</p>

<p>"But he hasn't sent yet!"</p>
