  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MICHAEL QUIGLEY had a fair working knowledge of perverse
  humanity, having acquaintance with burglars, the better class of confidence
  man, professional forgers, long firm operators, swindlers, ingenious and
  naive, bank workers, bucket-shop keepers and pickpockets. He did not know
  White Face because nobody knew him, but that was a pleasure deferred. Sooner
  or later, the lone operator would make a mistake and come within the purview
  of a crime reporter.</p>

  <p>Michael knew almost everybody at Scotland Yard and addressed chief
  constables by their first names. He had spent week-ends with Dumont, the
  hangman, and had helped him through an attack of delirium tremens. He had in
  his room signed photographs of ci-devant royalties, heavy-weight champions
  and leading ladies. He knew just how normal and abnormal people would behave
  in almost any circumstances. But personal experience failed him in the case
  of Janice Harman, although he had heard of such cases.</p>

  <p>He could understand why a girl with no responsibilities (since she was an
  orphan) and three thousand pounds a year should want to do something useful
  in life and should choose to become a nurse in an East End clinic; other
  girls had allowed their enthusiasm for humanity to lead them into similar
  vocations, and Janice only differed from the majority in that she had not
  wearied of her philanthropy.</p>

  <p>She was very lovely, though he could never analyse the qualities which
  made for loveliness. She had amazingly clear eyes and a mouth that was red
  and sensitive&mdash;perhaps it was the quality of her skin. He was never
  sure&mdash;the only thing he was certain about was that he could look at her
  for hours and wanted to look at her forever.</p>

  <p>The one quality in her which made him wriggle uncomfortably was her cursed
  motherliness. He could never bridge the gulf which separated her from his
  twenty-seven years.</p>

  <p>She was twenty-three and, as she often told him, a woman of twenty-three
  was at least twenty years older than a man of the same age. But twenty-three
  can be motherly or cruel. One night she told him something that struck all
  the colour out of life. It was the night they went to supper at the Howdah
  Club&mdash;the night of Michael's pay-day.</p>

  <p>He knew, of course, about her romantic correspondent. Had sneered at him,
  raved at him, grown wearily amused about it all. The correspondence started
  in the most innocent fashion. One day a letter had come to Janice's flat in
  Bury Street, asking if she would be kind enough to place the writer in touch
  with his old nurse, who had fallen on evil times. This was a few months after
  she had begun her work in Dr. Marford's clinic and one of the newspapers had
  found a good story in the "rich young society woman" who had given her life
  to good works. The letter was written from South Africa and enclosed five
  pounds, which the writer begged her to hand to his old nurse if she found
  her, or to the funds of the clinic if she did not.</p>

  <p>"How do you know this fellow isn't working a confidence trick on you?"
  demanded Michael.</p>

  <p>"Don't be stupid," said Janice scornfully. "Because you are a wretched
  crime reporter you think that the world is made up of criminals."</p>

  <p>"And I'm right," said Michael.</p>

  <p>That the unknown stranger had arrived in England Michael did not know
  until ten days later. She called him up, asked him to take her to supper: she
  had some important things to tell him.</p>

  <p>"You're one of the oldest friends I have, Michael," she said, speaking
  rather breathlessly. "And I feel that I ought to tell you."</p>

  <p>He listened, stunned.</p>

  <p>She might have seen how pale his face was, but she purposely did not look
  at him, fixing her eyes on the dancing couples on the floor.</p>

  <p>"I want you to meet him&mdash;you may not think he is wonderful, but I've
  always known... from his letters, I mean... he has lived a terrible life in
  the wilds of Africa; I'll be terribly sorry to leave Dr. Marford... I shall
  have to tell him, of course..."</p>

  <p>She was incoherent, a little hysterical.</p>

  <p>"Let me get this right, Janice. I'll try to forget that I love you and
  that I was only waiting until I got my salary raised before I told you." His
  voice was very steady, so unemotional that there was every encouragement to
  look at him. Nevertheless she kept her eyes steadily averted.</p>

  <p>"This isn't unusual&mdash;I have heard of such cases. A girl starts a
  correspondence with a man she has never seen. The correspondence grows more
  intimate, more friendly. She weaves around him a net of romance. And then she
  meets him and is either&mdash;disillusioned, or else falls for him. I've
  heard of happy marriages which started that way &mdash;I've heard of others.
  I can't believe it is true&mdash;but obviously it is, and I don't exactly
  know what to do or say."</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that he missed something from her hand&mdash;a long
  oval-shaped ruby ring that she had worn since he had first known her.</p>

  <p>Instantly she knew what he was looking for and dropped her hand out of
  sight.</p>

  <p>"Where is your ring?" he asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>She had gone very red: the question was almost unnecessary.</p>

  <p>"I've&mdash;I don't see what it has to do with you?"</p>

  <p>He drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"Nothing has to do with me&mdash;but I'm curious. An exchange of love
  tokens?"</p>

  <p>He was very tactless to-night.</p>

  <p>"It was my ring and I refuse to be cross-examined by a&mdash;by somebody
  who hasn't any right. You're being horrible."</p>

  <p>"Am I?" He nodded slowly. "I suppose I am, and I know I've no right to be
  horrid or anything else. I won't ask you to show me what you got in exchange.
  A bead necklace perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She started at this chance shot.</p>

  <p>"How did you know? I mean, it is very valuable."</p>

  <p>He looked long and earnestly at the girl.</p>

  <p>"I want to vet this fellow, Janice."</p>

  <p>She saw his face now and was in a panic&mdash;not on his behalf, but on
  her own.</p>

  <p>"Vet&mdash;I don't know what you mean?"</p>

  <p>He tried, with a smile, to minimise the offensiveness of what he had to
  say.</p>

  <p>"Well, make inquiries about him. You vet a horse before you buy
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not buying him&mdash;he is a rich man&mdash;well, he has two farms."
  Her manner was cold. There was a touch of resentment in her voice. "Vet him!
  You'll find he is a criminal, of course; if you can't find this, your fertile
  imagination will invent something. Perhaps he is White Face! He is one of
  your specialities, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>He groaned miserably. Yet here was an opportunity to escape from a
  maddening topic.</p>

  <p>"He is not an invention; he's a fact. Ask Gasso."</p>

  <p>Gasso, the slim maitre d'hotel, was near the table. Mike beckoned him.</p>

  <p>"Ah! That White Face! Where is your so-called police? My poor friend
  Bussini has his restaurant ruined by the fellow."</p>

  <p>It was to Bussini's restaurant that White Face had come in the early hours
  of a morning and, stepping to the side of Miss Angela Hillingcote, had
  relieved her of six thousand pounds worth of jewels before the dancers
  realised that the man in the white mask, who had appeared from nowhere, was
  not a guest in fancy dress. It was all over in a second or two and he was
  gone. A policeman at the corner of Leicester Square saw a man fly past on a
  motor cycle. The cycle had been seen on the Embankment going eastward. It was
  the third and most spectacular appearance of White Face in the West End of
  London.</p>

  <p>"My patrons are nervous&mdash;who is not?" Gasso apparently shared their
  nervousness. "Fortunately they are refined people&mdash;" He stopped suddenly
  and stared at the entrance of the room. "She should not come!" he almost
  shrieked and darted forward to meet an unwanted guest.</p>

  <p>This was a blonde lady who called herself Dolly de Val. It was found for
  her by an imaginative film agent, who thought&mdash;and rightly &mdash;that
  it sounded more pretentious than Annie Gootch, which name she had borne in
  the days of her poverty. She was not a good actress, because she could never
  quite remember all that the producer told her, and more often than not she
  was the only girl in the front line who kicked with her right leg when she
  should have kicked with her left. And frequently she was not in the line at
  all.</p>

  <p>But there were quite a lot of people who found her attractive, and in the
  course of the years she became very rich, and packed a considerable amount of
  her fortune into platinum settings, so that in all the fashionable night
  clubs of London she was known as "Diamond Dolly."</p>

  <p>Managers of such clubs and fashionable cabaret restaurants grew a little
  nervous after the Hillingcote affair, and when Dolly booked a supper table
  table they rang up Scotland Yard and Superintendent Mason, who was in control
  of "C" area, but had an executive post at headquarters, would delegate a
  couple of detectives arrayed like festive gentlemen, but looking remarkably
  like detectives, to the club or restaurant favoured by her dazzling display,
  and these were generally to be found lounging in the vestibule or drinking
  surreptitious glasses of beer in the manager's office.</p>

  <p>But sometimes Dolly did not notify her intentions beforehand. And she
  would glitter into the club surrounded by handsome young men, and a hasty
  table would be wedged impossibly on the packed floor and waiters would lay
  the table with extraordinary enthusiasm, conveying the impression that this
  was a favoured position for a table.</p>

  <p>She came this night unheralded into the Howdah Club and Gasso, who was
  Latin and entirely without self-control, threw up his hands to the ceiling,
  stiff with cupids, and said things in Italian which sounded very romantic to
  people who only understood English.</p>

  <p>"No room&mdash;don't be stupid, Gasso! Of course there's room. Anywhere
  will do, won't it, boys?"</p>

  <p>So they put a table near the door, and Dolly sat and ordered consomme
  Julienne, chicken a la Maryland.</p>

  <p>"I don't like you to seet here, madam," said Gasso fearfully, "with so
  much beautiful jewellery... Miss 'Illingcote&mdash;ah, what a disaster! This
  fellow with the white face&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up, Gasso!" Dolly snapped. "And, after that, we'll have coupe
  Jacques and coffee..."</p>

  <p>The Russian dancers had taken the floor and had made their exit after the
  third encore, when&mdash;"Bail up&mdash;you!"</p>

  <p>Dolly, who had seen the face of her escort suddenly blanch, half turned in
  her chair.</p>

  <p>The man in the doorway wore a long black coat that reached to his heels,
  his face was covered by a white cloth in which two eye-holes had been
  cut.</p>

  <p>He carried an automatic in his gloved hand, with the other, which was
  bare, he reached out.</p>

  <p>There was a "snick"&mdash;the long diamond chain about Dolly's neck
  parted. She stood frozen with fear and saw the glittering thing vanish into
  his pocket.</p>

  <p>Men had risen from the tables, women were screaming, the band stood
  ludicrously grouped. "After him!" yelled a voice.</p>

  <p>But the man in the white mask was gone and the cowering footmen, who had
  bolted on his entrance, came out from cover.</p>

  <p>"Don't move&mdash;I'll get you out in a minute." Mike's voice was urgent,
  but she heard him like one in a dream. "I'll take you home; I must get
  through to my paper. If you faint, I'll be rough with you!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to faint," she quavered.</p>

  <p>He got her out before the police came, and found a cab.</p>

  <p>"It was dreadful; who is he?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he answered shortly. Then&mdash;"What's this romantic
  lover's name&mdash;you've never told me?"</p>

  <p>Her nerves were on edge; she needed the stimulant of righteous anger to
  recover her poise and here was an excuse.</p>

  <p>Mike Quigley listened unmoved to her tirade.</p>

  <p>"A good looker, I'll bet; not a gaunt-faced, tow-haired brute like me," he
  said savagely. "O God, what a fool you are, Janice! I'm going to meet him.
  Where is he staying?"</p>

  <p>"You'll not meet him." She could have wept. "And I won't tell you where he
  is staying. I hope I never see you again!"</p>

  <p>She declined the hand he offered to assist her out of the cab; did not
  answer his "good night."</p>

  <p>Mr. Quigley went raging back to Fleet Street, and all the vicious things
  he wrote about White Face he meant for the handsome and romantic stranger
  from South Africa.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A SLOVENLY description of Janice Harman would be that she
  was the product of her generation. She had inherited the eternal qualities of
  womanhood as she enjoyed a freedom of development which was unknown in the
  formal age when guardians were restrictive and gloomy figures looming behind
  the young and beautiful heiress.</p>

  <p>Janice had attained independence almost unconsciously; had her own banking
  account when she was seventeen, and left behind the tangibilities of
  discipline when she passed from the tutelage of the venerable head mistress
  of her school.</p>

  <p>A bachelor uncle was the only relative she had possessed. In a spasmodic
  and jolly way he was interested in his niece, made her a lavish allowance,
  sent her beautiful and useless presents at Christmas and on her birthday,
  which he invariably remembered a month after. When he was killed in a motor
  accident (the three chorus girls who were driving with him escaped with a
  shaking) she found herself a comparatively rich young woman.</p>

  <p>He had appointed as trustee a friend whose sole claim to his confidence
  lay in the fact that he was the best judge of hunters in England, and was one
  of the few men who could drink half a dozen glasses of port blindfolded and
  unerringly distinguish the vintage of each.</p>

  <p>Janice left school with an exalted code of values and certain ideals which
  she religiously maintained. She had in her bedroom a framed portrait of the
  Prince of Wales, and she took the Sacrament on Christmas mornings.</p>

  <p>At eighteen all men were heroes or dreadful; at nineteen she recognised a
  middle class which were neither heroic nor unspeakable. At twenty the
  highlights had receded and some of the duller tones were taking shape and
  perspective.</p>

  <p>Donald Bateman belonged to the old regime of idealism. In his handsome
  face and athletic figure she recaptured some of the enthusiasm of the
  class-room. He was Romance and Adventure, the living receptacle in which were
  stored all the desirable virtues of the perfect man. His modesty&mdash;he no
  more than inferred his excellent qualities&mdash;his robust personality, his
  good humour, his childish views about money, his naivete, were all adorable.
  He accepted her judgments and estimates of people and events, giving to her a
  sense of superiority which was very delightful.</p>

  <p>In one respect he pleased her: he did not embarrass her more than once. He
  never forgot that their acquaintance was of the slightest, and the word
  "love" had never been uttered. The second time they had met he had kissed
  her, and she was ridiculously uncomfortable. He must have seen this, for he
  did not repeat the experiment. But they talked of marriage and their home and
  the wonders of South Africa; she could even discuss in a prim way the problem
  of children's education. A breezy figure of a man, delightfully boyish.</p>

  <p>She was taking afternoon duty at the clinic and had been worrying about
  him all the morning&mdash;he had been a little depressed when she had seen
  him last.</p>

  <p>"Did your money come?" she asked, with a smile.</p>

  <p>He took out his pocket-book and drew forth two crisp notes. She saw they
  were each for a hundred pounds.</p>

  <p>"It arrived this morning. I drew out these in case of emergency &mdash;I
  hate being without money when I'm in London. Angel, if the money hadn't
  turned up, I should have been borrowing from you this morning, and then what
  would you have thought of me?"</p>

  <p>She smiled again. Men were so silly about money. Michael, for instance.
  She had wanted him to have a little car, and he had been almost churlish when
  she offered to help him.</p>

  <p>He sat down and lit a cigarette, blowing a cloud of smoke to the
  ceiling.</p>

  <p>"Did you enjoy your dinner?"</p>

  <p>She made a little face.</p>

  <p>"Not very much."</p>

  <p>"He's a reporter, isn't he? I know a reporter on the Cape Times
  &mdash;quite a good chap&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't Michael who made the dinner a failure," she intervened loyally.
  "It was a man who came into the club with a white mask."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" He raised his eyebrows. "The Howdah Club&mdash;White Face? I've been
  reading about it in this morning's papers. I wish I'd been there. What is
  happening to the men in this country that they allow a fellow like that to
  get away with it? If I'd been within reach of him one of us would have been
  on the floor. The trouble with you people in England is that you're scared of
  firearms. I know from my own experience..."</p>

  <p>He told a story of a prospector's camp in Rhodesia; it was a story which
  did not place him in an unfavourable light.</p>

  <p>He sat facing the window, and during the narrative she had time to
  scrutinise him&mdash;not critically, but with indiscriminate approval. He was
  older than she had thought; forty, perhaps. There were little lines round his
  eyes, and harder ones near his mouth. That he had led a difficult and a
  dangerous life, she knew. One cannot starve and thirst in the desert of the
  Kalahari, or lie alone racked with fever on the banks of the Tuli River, or
  find oneself unarmed and deserted by carriers in the lion country west of
  Massikassi, and present an unlined and boyish face to the world. He still
  bore beneath his chin the long scar which a leopard's claw had left.</p>

  <p>"Living in Africa nowadays is like living in Bond Street," he sighed. "All
  the old mystery has departed. I don't believe there's a lion left between
  Salisbury and Bulawayo. In the old days you used to find them lying in the
  middle of the road..."</p>

  <p>She could listen to him for hours, but, as she explained, there was work
  to do.</p>

  <p>"I'll come down and bring you home&mdash;where is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She explained the exact location of Tidal Basin. "Dr. Marford &mdash;what
  sort of a man is he?"</p>

  <p>"He's a darling," said Janice enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>"We'll have him out at the Cape." He echoed her enthusiasm. "It's very
  easy. There's an extraordinary amount of work to be done, especially with the
  coloured children. If I can buy that farm next to mine, we might turn the
  farm building into a sort of convalescent home. It's one of those big,
  rambling Dutch houses and, as I've rather a nice house of my own, I shouldn't
  have use for the other."</p>

  <p>She laughed at this.</p>

  <p>"You're suffering from land hunger, Donald," she said. "I shall have to
  write and get particulars of this desirable property!"</p>

  <p>He frowned. "Have you any friends at the Cape?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "I know a boy there&mdash;he was a Rhodes
  scholar&mdash;but I haven't written to him since he left England."</p>

  <p>"H'm!" He was rather serious now. "When strangers come into the property
  market they soak 'em! Let me give you a word of advice: never try to buy land
  in South Africa through an agent&mdash;half of 'em are robbers, the other
  half an incompetent lot. One thing is certain, that the property at
  Paarl&mdash;that is where my farm is&mdash;will double itself in value in a
  couple of years. They are running a new railway through&mdash;it passes at
  the end of my land&mdash;and that will make an immense difference. If I had a
  lot of money to invest I should put every cent of it in land."</p>

  <p>He explained, however, that the Cape Dutch, who were the largest
  landowners in the country, were a suspicious folk who never did business with
  an Englishman, except to the latter's disadvantage.</p>

  <p>He took out the two hundred pound notes and looked at them again, rustling
  them affectionately.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you put it back in the bank?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Because I like the feel of it," he said gaily. "These English notes are
  so clean-looking."</p>

  <p>He returned the case to his pocket, and suddenly caught her by both arms.
  She saw a light in his eyes which she had never seen before. She was
  breathless and a little frightened.</p>

  <p>"How long are we going to wait?" he asked in a low voice. "I can get a
  special licence; we can be married and on the Continent in two days."</p>

  <p>She disengaged herself; discovered, to her amazement, that she was
  trembling, and that the prospect of an immediate marriage filled her with a
  sense of consternation.</p>

  <p>"That is impossible," she said breathlessly. "I've ever such a lot of work
  to do, and I've got to finish up my work at the clinic. And, Donald, you said
  you didn't want to be married for months."</p>

  <p>He smiled down at her.</p>

  <p>"I can wait months or years," he said lightly, "but I can't wait for my
  lunch. Come along!"</p>

  <p>She had only half an hour to give to him, but he promised to meet her and
  take her to dinner that night. The prospect did not arouse in her any sense
  of pleasurable anticipation. She told herself she loved him. He was
  everything that she would have him be. But immediate marriage? She shook her
  head.</p>

  <p>"What are you shaking your head about?" he asked.</p>

  <p>They were at Pussini's, and, as it was before one o'clock, the restaurant
  was empty save for themselves.</p>

  <p>"I was just thinking," she said.</p>

  <p>"About my farm?" He was looking at her searchingly. "No? About me?"</p>

  <p>And then suddenly she asked: "What is your bank, Donald?"</p>

  <p>He was completely surprised at the question.</p>

  <p>"My bank? Well, the Standard Bank&mdash;not exactly the Standard Bank, but
  a bank that is affiliated with it. Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>She had a good and benevolent reason for putting the question, but this
  she was not prepared to reveal.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you later," she said, and when she saw that she had worried
  him she was on the point of making her revelation. "It's really nothing,
  Donald."</p>

  <p>He drove down with her to Tidal Basin, but refused the offer of her car to
  take him back, his excuse being that he felt nervous of the London traffic.
  She was secretly glad that there was some feature of London life of which he
  stood in awe.</p>

  <p>Mr. Donald Bateman came back to town in a taxi and spent the afternoon in
  the City office of a tourist agency, examining Continental routes. He would
  like to have stayed in London; but then, he would like to have stayed in so
  many places from which expediency had dragged him. There was Inez. She had
  grown into quite a beautiful woman. He had seen her, though she was not aware
  of the fact. It was curious how women developed. He remembered
  her&mdash;rather sharp-featured, a gawk of a girl who had bored him utterly.
  In what way would Janice grow? For the moment she was very delectable, though
  she had qualities which exasperated him. Perfect women, he decided, were
  difficult to find.</p>

  <p>When he had caught her by the shoulders that morning and looked down into
  her eyes, he had expected some other reaction than that fit of shivering. She
  had shown her alarm too clearly for him to carry the matter any further. It
  must be marriage, of course. But marriage was rather dangerous in a country
  like this. That reporter friend of hers? He hated reporters; they were a
  prying, unscrupulous lot. And crime reporters were the worst.</p>

  <p>He began to feel uncomfortable, and turned relief to a contemplation of
  the physical perfection of Inez. From Inez his mind strayed to other women.
  What had become of Lorna, for example? Tommy had found her, probably, and
  forgiven everything. Tommy was always a weak-willed sap. But Inez!...</p>

  <p>He and Janice dined together that night, and most resolutely he chose the
  Howdah Club. Already the outrage had had effect upon the attendance: the
  dining-room was half empty, and Gasso stalked up and down, a picture of
  gloom.</p>

  <p>"This has ruined me, young miss," he said brokenly. "You were here last
  night with the newspaper gentleman. People will not come unless they have no
  jewels. And I particularly desire jewelled people here, but not jewelled as
  Miss Dolly!"</p>

  <p>"I hope he comes to-night," said Donald with a quiet smile.</p>

  <p>"You 'ope so, eh?" asked the agitated Gasso. "You desire me to be thrown
  into the street with only my shirt on my back? That is good for
  business!"</p>

  <p>Janice was laughing, but she succeeded in pacifying the outraged maitre
  d'hotel.</p>

  <p>"It certainly is empty, but I don't suppose we shall see our white-faced
  gentleman." said Donald. "It's rather like old times. I remember when I was
  in Australia there was a gang which held up a bank&mdash;they wore white
  masks, too. They got away with some money, by Jove! Ever heard of the Furses?
  They were brothers&mdash;the cleverest hold-up men in Australia."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps this is one of them," she said thoughtlessly.</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>She could have sworn he was frightened at that moment. Something she saw
  in his eyes. It was absurd, of course, for Donald Bateman was afraid of
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think so," he said.</p>

  <p>Half-way through dinner, when they were discussing some amiable nothing,
  he dropped his knife and fork on the plate. Again she saw that frightened
  look intensified. He was staring at somebody, and she followed the direction
  of his eyes.</p>

  <p>A man had come in. He must have been nearly sixty, was slim, dandified,
  rather fussy. He had a small party with him, and they were surrounded by
  waiters. Curiously enough, she knew him: curious, because she had made his
  acquaintance in a slum.</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;who is that?" His voice was strained. "That man there, with the
  girls? Do you&mdash;do you know him?"</p>

  <p>"That is Dr. Rudd," she said.</p>

  <p>"Rudd!"</p>

  <p>"He's the police surgeon of our division&mdash;I've often seen him. In
  fact, he once came to the clinic. Quite an unpleasant man&mdash;he had
  nothing at all nice to say about our work."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Rudd!"</p>

  <p>The colour was coming back to his face. He had gone pale! She was
  astounded.</p>

  <p>"Do you know him?" she asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>He smiled with difficulty.</p>

  <p>"No; he reminds me of somebody&mdash;an old friend of mine in
  &mdash;er&mdash;Rhodesia."</p>

  <p>She noticed that when on their way out he passed the doctor's group Donald
  was patting his face with a handkerchief as though he were healing a
  scratch.</p>

  <p>"Are you hurt?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"A little neuralgia." He laughed cheerily. "That is the penalty one pays
  for sleeping out night after night in the rain."</p>

  <p>He told her a story of a rainfall in Northern Rhodesia that had lasted
  four weeks on end.</p>

  <p>"And all that time," he said, "I had not so much as a tent."</p>

  <p>She left him at the door of the flat in Bury Street, and he was frankly
  disappointed, for he had expected to be asked up to her apartment. There was
  consolation on the way back to the hotel, certain anticipations of an
  interview he had arranged for the morrow. It was not with Janice.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN his rare moments of leisure Dr. Marford was wont to stand
  in his surgery, behind the red calico curtains which were stretched across
  the big window level with the bridge of his thin, aristocratic nose, and
  muse, a little sourly, upon Tidal Basin, its people and its future.</p>

  <p>He had material for speculation on those summer evenings, when the light
  of the brazen day still persisted in the western skies, and when every dive
  and tenement spilt the things that were so decently hidden in the cold days
  and nights of winter. On such nights the sweltering heat forced into the open
  the strangest beings, creatures which even the oldest inhabitants could not
  remember having seen before and the most hardened could hardly wish to see
  again.</p>

  <p>The red calico curtain was strung across the window of the large room
  which was his surgery. It had been a boot store and a confectioner's parlour.
  Loucilensky, of infamous memory, had housed his "club" in it and found the
  side door which led to the little yard a convenient exit for his squalid
  patrons.</p>

  <p>It was a derelict property when Dr. Marford came to found his practice
  here. All Tidal Basin knew that the doctor was so poor that he had painted,
  distempered and scrubbed the place from top to bottom with his own hands. He
  had probably sewn his own curtains, had certainly collected from the
  Caledonian Market, where you may furnish a house for a few pounds, such
  domestic equipment as was necessary for his well-being. Tidal Basin, which
  favoured those cinemas which featured pictures of high life, had despised him
  for his poverty. A consumptive plumber had fixed the huge sink, which was an
  unsightly feature of one corner of the surgery, and had received, in return,
  free treatment and medicine until he went the dingy way of all consumptive
  plumbers.</p>

  <p>Tidal Basin had known and still knew Dr. Marford as the "penny doctor."
  They knew him better as the "baby doctor," for, after he had been in Tidal
  Basin a year, by some miracle he succeeded in founding a free clinic, where
  he gave ray treatment to children. He must have had influential friends, for
  on top of his other activities he founded a small convalescent home at the
  seaside.</p>

  <p>His work was his obsession, and not a penny of the money which came to him
  went to his own advantage. The drab surgery remained as shabby as it had
  always been&mdash;a very dreary place compared with the spick and span little
  palace of white enamel and glass where the children of Tidal Basin were made
  acquainted with artificial sunlight and the beneficent quality of strange
  rays.</p>

  <p>He saw Janice Harman pass the window and went to open the door to her. It
  was not true that this preoccupied man was hardly aware of her loveliness. He
  used to sit at his desk and think about her for hours on end. What strange
  dreams came to disorder the tidiness of his methodical mind was known only to
  Dr. Marford; and now, when she told him awkwardly, a little disjointedly, of
  her future plans, he showed no evidence of the sudden desolation and despair
  that crushed him.</p>

  <p>("The oddest people fall in love with Janice," said her best friend.)</p>

  <p>"Oh!" he said, and bit his thin lip thoughtfully. "That is very
  unfortunate&mdash;for the clinic. What does Mr. Quigley say to all this?"</p>

  <p>Hitherto he had felt an unreasonable antipathy to the young reporter, who
  had been a too frequent visitor to the clinic, and had written too much and
  too enthusiastically about Dr. Marford's ventures to please a man who shrank
  instinctively from publicity.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Quigley has no right to raise any objections whatever." There was a
  note of defiance in her voice. "He is a very good friend&mdash;or was."</p>

  <p>There was an embarrassing pause.</p>

  <p>"But isn't any longer," said Dr. Marford gently.</p>

  <p>He experienced an inexplicable sense of kinship with Michael Quigley.</p>

  <p>Her native loyalty made her modify her attitude.</p>

  <p>"I like Michael&mdash;he is extraordinarily nice, but very domineering. He
  was awfully good to me the other night, and I was a beast to him. I was in
  the Howdah Club when that dreadful man came."</p>

  <p>He turned an inquiring face to her.</p>

  <p>"Which dreadful man?"</p>

  <p>"The robber&mdash;White Face."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know. I read the newspapers. I was talking to Sergeant Elk about
  him. There is a theory that he lives in this neighbourhood, a theory for
  which I am afraid your young friend is responsible. Are you wise?"</p>

  <p>He asked the question suddenly.</p>

  <p>"About&mdash;my marriage? Is any girl wise, Dr. Marford? Suppose I'd met
  this man every day of my life for years, should I know him&mdash;I mean, as
  one knows one's husband? Men always put on their best appearance for women,
  and unless one lives in the same house with them it is impossible to be
  absolutely sure."</p>

  <p>Marford nodded, fondling his bony chin.</p>

  <p>There was a long silence, which he broke.</p>

  <p>"I shall be sorry to lose you; you have been a most enthusiastic
  helper."</p>

  <p>Now she came to a delicate stage of the interview&mdash;delicate because
  she knew how sensitive he was on the point.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to give the Institute a little present," she said jerkily. "A
  thousand pounds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He raised his hand; his expression was genuinely pained.</p>

  <p>"No, no, no; I couldn't hear of it. You asked me once before if I would.
  No, I am satisfied that I have not paid you for the help you have given us.
  That is your splendid contribution to the clinic."</p>

  <p>She knew he would be adamant on this point and had already decided that if
  he refused her gift it should take the form of an anonymous donation on her
  wedding day. Michael, in one of his more cynical moods, had once accused her
  of being theatrical, and the charge was so ridiculous that she had laughed.
  Yet there is a touch of theatricality in every sentimentalist, and Janice
  Harman was not without that weakness.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly the doctor put out his thin hand and took hers.</p>

  <p>"I hope you will be happy," he said, and this was at once a benediction
  and a dismissal.</p>

  <p>She crossed the road at Endley Street. At the corner stood a tall,
  good-looking man, with greying hair at his temples. To her surprise he was
  talking to a woman, talking confidentially it seemed. Presently the woman
  walked away and he came, smiling, to meet the girl.</p>

  <p>"What a ghastly place, darling! I am so happy you're leaving it."</p>

  <p>"Who was that woman you were speaking to?" she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>He laughed&mdash;she loved that laugh of his.</p>

  <p>"Woman? Oh, yes." He looked round and nodded towards a slim figure walking
  ahead of them on the opposite side of the road. "It was rather odd &mdash;she
  thought I was her brother, and when she saw she'd made a mistake she was a
  little embarrassed. Rather a pretty girl."</p>

  <p>Her car was in a near-by garage&mdash;in the early days she had driven up
  to the clinic, which was at the far end of Endley Street, but the doctor had
  advised her against the practice&mdash;advice well justified, for in a week
  everything that was movable in the car had been stolen by the parents of the
  children she cared for.</p>

  <p>She seated herself at the wheel, a radiant figure of youth, he thought,
  more beautiful than even he in his wildest imaginings had dreamed. The car
  came down the slope of the road; she saw the shabby figure of the doctor
  watching them, and waved her hand to him.</p>

  <p>"Who was that?" he asked carelessly.</p>

  <p>"That was Dr. Marford."</p>

  <p>"Your boss, eh? I'd like to have had a look at him. He's a big noise
  around here."</p>

  <p>She laughed at this.</p>

  <p>"There isn't a tinier murmur in Tidal Basin," she said. "But he's
  marvellous! I sometimes think he starves himself to keep his clinic
  going."</p>

  <p>She rhapsodised all the way through the City. In Cranbourn Street they
  were held up by a traffic block. By this time he had gained command of the
  conversation and the excellences of Dr. Marford were relegated to a second
  place. He was talking of South Africa and his two farms, one in the wilds of
  Rhodesia, the other amidst the beauties of Paarl. He liked talking of the
  Paarl property.</p>

  <p>"It's going to be terribly slow for you, though there is some sort of
  social life at the Cape. I'm pretty well known&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's somebody who knows you," she laughed.</p>

  <p>He turned his head quickly, but could distinguish amongst the hurrying
  throng on the sidewalk no familiar face.</p>

  <p>"Where?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There&mdash;that dark man." She looked back. "He is standing by the
  hosiers."</p>

  <p>He looked round and frowned.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I know him&mdash;not very well, though; I got the better of him
  in a business deal, and he hasn't forgiven me." He uttered an exclamation.
  "Darling, I can't take you to the theatre to-night: I've just remembered.
  Will you forgive me?"</p>

  <p>She was too happy, too completely under the fascination of this exalted
  adventure, to resent the missed engagement. This good-looking stranger who
  had come from the blue, whose name she could hardly use without an
  unaccountable sense of shyness, was Romance&mdash;the fulfiliment of vague
  and delightful dreams. He was still outside the realms of reality.</p>

  <p>She had known him for ten days; it seemed that it was a lifetime. Once or
  twice during the journey she was on the point of telling him of the surprise
  she had for him. He was a great home-lover; his self-confessed sin was that
  he coveted his neighbour's land. There was a farm adjoining his at Paarl that
  had come into the market, could be had for a mere £8,000. He waxed
  enthusiastic on the advantage of having this additional
  property&mdash;vine-yards and orange groves, new pastures for his cattle.</p>

  <p>He returned to the subject as the car was crossing Piccadilly Circus.</p>

  <p>"You've made me ambitious, you angel," he said. "I'm a poor farmer and
  can't lay my hands on a fortune, so the farm will have to go."</p>

  <p>Again she was nearly telling him. She had a friend in Cape Town, a young
  lawyer, a Rhodes scholar, whom she had met at Oxford. That very morning she
  had wired to him, asking him to buy the property.</p>

  <p>He parted from her at the door of her flat in Bury Street, and her
  chauffeur, who was waiting, drove him to his modest hotel. At parting: "I
  hate the thought of losing that farm&mdash;if I could cable four thousand
  pounds to-morrow morning I could clinch the bargain."</p>

  <p>She smiled demurely and went up to her room to daydream of green slopes
  and high, sun-baked mountains where the little baboons chatter all day and
  night.</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock that night, when she was undressing for bed, came a
  cablegram which left her white and shaking. It was in one sense remarkable
  that the first person she thought of to help her in her necessity was Michael
  Quigley; but when she reached for the telephone with a trembling hand it was
  to learn that Michael had left the office on a hurry call. She looked at the
  clock; it was by then half-past ten. She changed her mind about going to bed
  and began to dress quickly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER Janice had left, Dr. Marford walked slowly to that
  corner of the surgery where his drugs were stocked and began to dispense the
  medicines he had prescribed in the course of the day. This was generally his
  afternoon task, but he had spent most of the day at the clinic.</p>

  <p>He wearied of the task very soon and went to his desk. There was a heap of
  papers to go through&mdash;the accounts from the clinic showed a heavy
  deficit. The place ate money: there was always new apparatus to buy, new
  equipment to furnish. The daily report from the convalescent home in
  Eastbourne, which maintained the progress of a dozen small hooligans of Tidal
  Basin, was as cheerless; but it brought no sense of depression to Dr.
  Marford. He grudged nothing to these ventures of his&mdash;neither time nor
  exertion.</p>

  <p>He was expecting a remittance almost any day. There was a man in Antwerp
  who sent him money regularly, and another in Birmingham&mdash;he pushed the
  papers aside, looked at his watch and went out by the side door into the
  yard.</p>

  <p>It was a fairly large yard. At one end was the big shed in which old
  Gregory Wick's kept his taxicab, paying a small weekly rent.</p>

  <p>Old Gregory Wicks had been a famous driver even in the days of the festive
  hansom. And always he had housed his horses and his resplendent cab in Tidal
  Basin, where he was born and where he hoped to end his days. In his advanced
  middle age came the taxicab. Gregory refused to regard motor vehicles as
  new-fangled crazes that would soon go out of fashion. He was one of the first
  to sit at a driving wheel at a motor school and solve the mysteries of
  clutches and gears. He found his lameness no obstacle in obtaining a
  cab-driver's licence&mdash;he limped from a thirty-year-old injury to his
  ankle.</p>

  <p>Always he was a night bird; even in the horse cab he went clop-clopping
  along Piccadilly in the early hours of the morning, picking up swells from
  the clubs and driving them unimaginable distances to their country houses.
  And when the taxi came he continued his nocturnal wanderings. A silent,
  taciturn man, who never stood on a rank or invited the confidence of his
  brother drivers, he was known locally and abroad for his rigid honesty. It
  was he who restored to a certain Austrian baron a million kroners in hard
  paper cash, left in the cab by the Herr Baron in a moment of temporary
  aberration caused by a quarrel with a lady friend. Old Gregory had returned
  thousands of pounds' worth of goods left by absent-minded riders. In the
  police books he was marked "Reliable; honest; very excellent record."</p>

  <p>You could see him and his cab on certain nights prowling along Regent
  Street, his long, white hair hanging over the collar of his coat, his fierce
  white moustache bristling from his pink, emaciated face, choosing his fares
  with a nice discrimination. He had no respect for any man save one. In his
  more than seventy-year-old arms he packed a punch that was disconcerting to
  the punchee.</p>

  <p>The doctor unfastened a door and passed through into Gallows Court. That
  narrow and unsavoury passage was alive with children&mdash;bare-legged,
  unwashed and happy. Nobody offered the doctor a friendly greeting. The frowsy
  men and women lounging in the doorways or at the upstairs windows favoured
  him with incurious glances. He was part of the bricks and mortar and mud of
  the place, one with the brick wall which separated his yard from this human
  sty. He belonged there, had a right in Gallows Court, and, that being so,
  might pass without notice or comment.</p>

  <p>The last house in the court was No. 9; smaller than the others; the
  windows were clean, and even the lower one, which was heavily shuttered, had
  a strip of chintz curtain. He knocked at the door&mdash;three short quick
  raps, a pause and a fourth. This signal had been agreed as between himself
  and old man Wicks; for Gregory had been annoyed by runaway knocks and by the
  appearance on his doorstep of unwelcome visitors. He knew the regular hour at
  which the milkman called and the baker, and could cope with them. Whosoever
  else knocked at the door during the daytime received no answer. Marford heard
  the shuffle of feet on uncarpeted stairs and the door was opened.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Doctor." Gregory's voice was loud and hearty. He had been a
  shouter all his life, and age had not diminished the volume of his tone.
  "Don't make a row; I expect the lodger's asleep," he said as he closed the
  door with a slam.</p>

  <p>"He must be a very good sleeper if you don't wake him, you noisy old man!"
  said Marford, with his quiet smile.</p>

  <p>Gregory guffawed all the way up the stairs, opened the door of his room
  and the doctor passed in. "How are you?"</p>

  <p>"Fit as a flea, except this other little trouble, and I'm not going to
  mention that. I'm doing fine. Doctor. Sit down. Where's a chair? Here we are!
  What I owe to you, Doctor! If the people in Tidal Basin knew what you've done
  for me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said Marford good-humouredly. "Now let me have a look at
  you."</p>

  <p>He turned the old man's face to the light and made a careful
  examination.</p>

  <p>"You're no better and no worse. If anything you're a little better, I
  should think. I'll test your heart."</p>

  <p>"My heart!" said the other scornfully. "I've got the heart of a lion!
  There was an Irish family moved in here and the woman wanted to borrow a
  saucepan, and when I told her just what I thought of people who borrow
  saucepans, along came her husband&mdash;a new fellow, full of brag and
  bluster! I gave him one smack in the jaw and that was his finish!"</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't do it, Gregory. It was a stupid thing to do. I heard about
  it from one of my other patients."</p>

  <p>The old man was chuckling gleefully.</p>

  <p>"I needn't have done it at all," he said. "Any of the boys round here
  would have put him out if I'd said the word. I dare say the lodger would, but
  of course I wouldn't have wakened him up."</p>

  <p>"Is he here to-day?"</p>

  <p>Gregory shook his head. "The Lord knows! I never hear him come in or go
  out, except sometimes. I've never known a quieter fellow. Reformed, eh,
  Doctor? I'll bet you I know who reformed him! You'd never dream"&mdash;he
  lowered his voice&mdash;"that he was a man who'd spent half his life in
  stir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're giving him a chance," said Marford.</p>

  <p>He was going, when the old man called him back. "Doctor, I want to tell
  you something. I made my will to-day&mdash;not exactly a will, but I wrote
  down what I wanted doing with my money."</p>

  <p>"Have you got a lot, Gregory?" asked the other good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>"More than you think." There was a significance in the old man's voice. "A
  lot more! It's not money that makes me do what I'm doing&mdash;it's
  pride&mdash;swank!"</p>

  <p>To most men who had known him for years, Gregory Wicks was a taciturn and
  uncommunicative man. Marford was one of the few who knew him. He often
  thought that this loquacity which Gregory displayed at home was his natural
  reaction to the hours of silence on the box. Night after night for nearly
  half a century this old cabman had placed himself under a vow of silence.
  Once he explained why, and the reason was so inadequate that Marford, who was
  not easily amused, laughed in spite of himself. Gregory had in a talkative
  moment allowed a client&mdash;he always called his fares "clients"&mdash;to
  wish a counterfeit half-crown upon him. It was a lesson never to be
  forgotten.</p>

  <p>The doctor often came in to chat with the old man, to hear stories of dead
  and forgotten celebrities whose names were famous in the eighties and the
  late seventies. As he was leaving, Gregory referred again to his lodger.</p>

  <p>"It was a good idea putting up that shutter to keep out the noise, though
  personally there's nothing that would stop me sleeping. I sometimes wish he'd
  be a bit more lively&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And come up and have a little chat with you at times?" suggested
  Marford.</p>

  <p>Gregory almost shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Not that! I don't want to chat with anybody, especially strangers. I chat
  with you because you've been God's-brother-Bill to me, to use a vulgar
  expression. I don't say I'd have starved, because I shouldn't have done. But
  I'd have lost something that I'd rather die than lose."</p>

  <p>He came down to the door and stood looking out after the doctor, even when
  Marford was out of sight. The noisy children did not gibe at him, and none of
  these frowsy ones hurled their inevitable and unprintable jests in his
  direction. A wandering policeman they would have covered with derision. Only
  the doctor and Gregory Wicks escaped their grimy humour; the latter because
  of that ready fist of his, the doctor&mdash;well, you never know when the
  doctor will be called in, and if he's got a grudge against you who knows what
  he'll slip into your medicine? Or suppose he had to use the knife, eh? Nice
  so-and-so fool you'd look, lying under chloroform with your inn'ards at his
  mercy! Fear was a governing factor of life in Gallows Court.</p>

  <p class="first">THAT he had no other friends was good and sufficient reason
  why Mr. Elk should drop in at odd minutes to discuss with Dr. Marford the
  criminal tendencies and depravities of that section of the British Empire
  which lies between the northern end of Victoria Dock Road and the smelly
  drabness of Silvertown.</p>

  <p>Elk called on the evening Janice Harman took her farewell, and found Dr.
  Marford's melancholy eyes fixed upon the dreary pageant of Endley Street.
  They were working overtime in the shipyard, which was almost opposite his
  surgery, and the din of mechanical riveters would go on during the night. Dr.
  Marford was so accustomed to this noise that it was hardly noticeable. The
  sound of drunken songsters, the pandemonium which accompanied amateur
  pugilism, the shrill din of children playing in the streets&mdash;hereabouts
  they played till midnight&mdash;the rumbling of heavy lorries on the way to
  the Eastern Trading Company's yard which went on day and night never
  disturbed his sleep.</p>

  <p>"If I was sure this was hell"&mdash;Mr. Elk nodded his own gloomy face
  towards the thoroughfare&mdash;"I'd get religion. Not that I don't say my
  prayers every night&mdash;I do. I pray for the Divisional Inspector, the Area
  Inspector, the Big Five and the Chief Commissioner; I pray for the Examining
  Board and all other members of the criminal classes."</p>

  <p>The ghost of a smile illuminated the thin face of Dr. Marford. He was a
  man of thirty-five who looked older. Spare of build, his greying hair was
  thin on the top. He wore absurd little side-whiskers half-way down his cheek,
  and gold-rimmed spectacles, one lens of which was usually cracked.</p>

  <p>For a long time they stood in silence behind the calico curtains,
  attracting no attention from the passers-by, for there was no light in the
  surgery.</p>

  <p>"My idea of hell," said Elk again.</p>

  <p>Dr. Marford laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"With its own particular devil, by all accounts," he said.</p>

  <p>Detective-Sergeant Elk permitted himself to guffaw.</p>

  <p>"That bunk! Listen, these people believe anything. Funny thing, they don't
  read, so they couldn't have got the idea out of books. It's one of
  the&mdash;what do you call the word&mdash;um&mdash;damn it! I've got it on
  the end of my tongue..."</p>

  <p>"Legends?"</p>

  <p>"That's it&mdash;it's like the Russians passing through England with the
  snow on their boots. Everybody's met the man who saw 'em, but you never meet
  him. Every time there's a murder nobody can explain, you see it in the
  newspaper bills: 'The Devil of Tidal Basin,' an' even after you've pinched
  the murderer an' all the earth knows that he never heard of Tidal Basin, or
  thinks it's a patent wash-bowl, they still hang on to the idea. These
  newspapers! Next summer you'll have joy-wagons full of American trippers
  comin' here. Limehouse has had it, why shouldn't we?"</p>

  <p>A bright young newspaper man had invented the Devil of the Basin. It was
  the general opinion in Tidal Basin that he wasn't any too bright either.</p>

  <p>"There is a devil&mdash;hundreds of 'em! The waterside crowd wouldn't
  think twice of putting me out. They tried one night&mdash;Dan Salligan. The
  flowers I sent to the man when he was in hospital is nobody's business."</p>

  <p>Dr. Marford moved uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I helped that legend to grow. The reporter saw me and
  very&mdash;er&mdash;indiscreetly, I told him of the patient who used to come
  to me&mdash;he hasn't been for months, by the way&mdash;always came at
  midnight with his face covered with a mask. It wasn't good to see the face, I
  mean. Explosion in a steel works."</p>

  <p>Elk was interested.</p>

  <p>"Where does he live?"</p>

  <p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. The reporter tried to find out but couldn't. He always paid
  me in gold&mdash;a pound a visit, which is forty times more than I get from
  my regulars."</p>

  <p>Mr. Elk was not impressed. His eyes were fixed upon the squalling
  larrikins in the roadway.</p>

  <p>"Weeds!" he said, and the doctor laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Those ugly little boys are probably great political leaders of the
  future, or literary geniuses. Tidal Basin may be stiff with mute, inglorious
  Miltons," he said.</p>

  <p>Sergeant Elk of the Criminal Investigation Department made a noise that
  expressed his contempt.</p>

  <p>"Nine-tenths of that crowd will pass through the hands of me and my
  successors," he said drearily, "and all your electric rays won't stop um! And
  such of them as don't finish in Dartmoor will end their days in the
  workhouse. Why they call it a workhouse, God knows. I've never known anybody
  to work in a workhouse except the staff. You know Mrs. Weston?" he asked
  suddenly. "A pretty woman. She's got the only respectable apartment in the
  Basin. All Ritzy&mdash;I went up there when some kids broke her windows.
  She's not much good."</p>

  <p>"If she's not much good," said Marford, and again that ghost of a smile
  came and went, "if she's not much good, I probably know her. If she's the
  kind of woman who doesn't pay her doctor's bills, I certainly know her. Why
  do you ask?"</p>

  <p>Elk took a cigar from his pocket and bit off the end. It was obviously a
  good cigar. He had hoarded it so long that it had irregular fringes of leaf.
  He lit it with great deliberation and puffed enjoyably.</p>

  <p>"She was saying that she knew you," he said, fully two minutes after the
  question had been asked. "Naturally I said a good word for you."</p>

  <p>"Say a few good words for the clinic," said the doctor.</p>

  <p>"I'm always doing it," said Sergeant Elk complacently. "You're wasting
  your time and other people's money, but I do it. That's a pretty nurse you've
  got&mdash;Miss Harman. Quigley the reporter's all goo-ey about her."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Dr. Marford quietly.</p>

  <p>He rose and pulled down the blind, went to a cupboard, took out a whisky
  bottle, a siphon and two glasses, and looked inquiringly at the
  detective.</p>

  <p>"I'm off duty," said Elk, "if a detective is ever off duty."</p>

  <p>He pulled up a chair to the writing table. The doctor was already in his
  worn leather chair. "Ever read detective stories?" asked Elk.</p>

  <p>Dr. Marford shook his head.</p>

  <p>At that moment the telephone rang. He took up the instrument, listened for
  a while, asked a few questions, and put down the receiver.</p>

  <p>"That's why I don't read detective or any other kind of stories," he said.
  "The population of Tidal Basin increases at a terrific rate, but not so
  rapidly as some people expect."</p>

  <p>He jotted a note down on a little pad.</p>

  <p>"That's a come-at-once call, but I don't suppose they will require my
  attention till three o'clock to-morrow morning. Why detective stories?"</p>

  <p>Sergeant Elk sipped at his whisky. He was not a man to be rushed into
  explanation.</p>

  <p>"Because," he said eventually, "I'd like some of these clever Mikes to
  take my patrol for a couple of months. I saw an American crook play up in the
  West End the other night. It was all about who-did-it. First of all they
  introduced you to about twenty characters, told you where they were born and
  who their fathers were, and what money they wanted and who they were in love
  with&mdash;you couldn't help knowing that the fellow who did the murder was
  the red-nosed waiter. But that's not police work, Dr. Marford. We're not
  introduced to the characters in the story; we don't know one. All we've got
  in a murder case is the dead man. What he is, who his relations are, where he
  came from, what was his private business &mdash;we've got to work all that
  out. We make inquiries here, there and everywhere, digging into slums, asking
  questions of people who've got something to hide."</p>

  <p>"Something to hide?" repeated the doctor.</p>

  <p>Elk nodded.</p>

  <p>"Everybody's got something to hide. Suppose you were a married
  man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which I am not," interrupted Marford.</p>

  <p>"We've got to suppose that," insisted Elk. "Your wife is abroad. You take
  a girl into the country..."</p>

  <p>The doctor made faint noises of protest.</p>

  <p>"We're supposin' all this," conceded Elk. "Such things have happened. And
  in the morning you look out of your window an' see a feller cut another
  feller's throat. You are a doctor and cannot afford to get your name into the
  papers. Are you going to the police and tell them what you saw? And are you
  going to stand up in court and tell them what you were doing out of town and
  the name of the lady you were with, and take the chance of it getting into
  all the papers? Or are you going to say nothing? Of course you are! That
  happens every day. In a murder case everybody has got something to hide, and
  that's why it's harder to get the truth about murder than any other kind of
  crime. Murder is a spot-light. You've got to take the stand and face a
  defending counsel who's out to prove that you're the sort of fellow that no
  decent jurywoman could ask to meet her young daughter."</p>

  <p>The detective sucked at his cigar for a long time in silence. Then he
  asked:</p>

  <p>"Bit of a mystery, this woman Lorna Weston?"</p>

  <p>The doctor's tired eyes surveyed him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. They're all mysteries to me. I can't remember their names.
  God, what names they've got! Like the patterns of a dull wallpaper &mdash;one
  running into the other. Jackson, Johnson, Thompson, Beckett, Dockett,
  Duckett, Roon, Doon, Boon... eh? And some without any names at all. I
  attended a young woman for three months&mdash;she was just 'the young woman
  upstairs,' or 'Miss What's-her-name.' Her landlady didn't know it. She was a
  waitress working nobody knew where. If she had died I couldn't have certified
  her. I called her Miss Smith&mdash;had to put some sort of name on the books.
  What does Mrs. Weston do for a living?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Elk made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"Well, you know, she's... well, she goes West every night all dolled
  up."</p>

  <p>The doctor nodded.</p>

  <p>"There are lots of 'em&mdash;a whole colony. Why do they live in this hell
  shoot? I suppose it's cheap. And their earnings are not what they were. One
  girl told me&mdash;but you can't believe 'em."</p>

  <p>He sighed heavily and sighed again.</p>

  <p>"You can't believe anybody."</p>

  <p>Elk got up, drained his glass and reached for his hat.</p>

  <p>"She wanted to know if you were an easy man to get on with. I got an idea
  she's a dope-getter. I don't know why, but I've just got that idea. There was
  a doctor in Silvertown who made a fortune out of it: he spent over a thousand
  on his defence when I got him to the Old Bailey..."</p>

  <p>The doctor went out with him, and they arrived at the street door at an
  opportune moment.</p>

  <p>The earlier sound of the battle had come to them in a confused hubbub of
  sound as they passed through the disinfected passage. As Marford opened the
  door he saw two men fighting, surrounded by a crowd. It was a fair fight,
  both men being well matched in point of physique and equally drunk. But they
  were too close to the granite kerb of the sidewalk. One of the combatants
  went down suddenly, and the grey, dusty kerbstone went red.</p>

  <p>"Here&mdash;you!"</p>

  <p>Elk made a grab at the victor and swung him round. The policemen came
  running and plunged through the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Take this man."</p>

  <p>Elk handed over his dazed prisoner and shouldered his way through the
  tightly packed knot of people that surrounded the man on the kerb.</p>

  <p>"Get him inside the doctor's shop. Lift him..."</p>

  <p>They carried the limp thing into the surgery and Dr. Marford made a brief
  examination whilst Mr. Elk bustled the bearers into the street.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked when he came back. "Hospital case, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Marford was fixing an enormous pad of gauze and cottonwool to the head of
  the white-faced man.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Do you mind ringing the ambulance? Two shillings' worth of surgical
  dressings and I don't get a cent for it. You can't sue their
  relations&mdash;they need the money for a swell funeral. Everybody has to go
  into black, and that costs money."</p>

  <p>Elk screwed up his lips painfully.</p>

  <p>"Is he booked?" he asked, looking at the figure with the awed curiosity
  which the living have for the dead.</p>

  <p>"I should think so: compound fracture of the occiput. Get him to the
  London and they may do something. It costs me ten shillings a week just for
  surgical dressings. I'll tell you something, and you can arrest me. If I get
  'em alone, I go through their pockets and take the cost of the dressing. But
  usually they've got some howling women with 'em who won't leave 'em. 'When
  pain and anguish wring the brow,' eh?"</p>

  <p>The ambulance came noisily and the patient was taken away.</p>

  <p>It was an incident not worth remembering&mdash;except for two shillings'
  worth of dressing that would never be liquidated.</p>

  <p>The doctor closed the door upon Mr. Elk, and went back to his books and
  his thoughts. Two inconvenient new lives were coming to Tidal Basin. The
  district nurses would call him in good time. Inconvenient... the children of
  an unemployable labourer and a father who was resting in one of His Majesty's
  prisons.</p>

  <p>As to this Lorna Weston...</p>

  <p>He knew her, of course. She often passed the surgery on her way to the
  provisions store next door, and once or twice she had come in to see him. A
  pretty woman, though her mouth was a trifle hard and straight. He never
  confessed to Elk that he knew anybody. Elk was a detective and respected no
  confidences.</p>

  <p>There was a phone call from Elk. The fighter had died on admission to
  hospital. The doctor was not surprised. An inquest, of course.</p>

  <p>"We shall want you as a witness," said Elk's voice. "He's a dock labourer
  from Poplar&mdash;a man named Stephens."</p>

  <p>"How thrilling!" said the doctor, hung up the receiver and went back to
  his book&mdash;the intrigues of Louis's court, the scheming Polignacs and the
  profitable machinations of Madame de Lamballe.</p>

  <p>He heard the shrill call of the door-bell, looked plaintively round,
  finally rose and went to the door. The night had come down blackly; the
  pavement outside was glistening: you do not hear the rain falling in the East
  End.</p>

  <p>"Are you Dr. Marford?"</p>

  <p>The woman who stood in the doorway exhaled the faint fragrance of some
  peculiarly delicate perfume. Her voice, thin for the moment with anxiety, had
  the quality of culture. She was a stranger; he had never heard that voice
  before.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Will you come in?"</p>

  <p>The surgery had no other light than the reading-lamp on the desk. He felt
  that she would have had it this way.</p>

  <p>She wore a leather motoring coat and a little tight-fitting hat. She
  unfastened the coat hurriedly as though she were hot or had some difficulty
  in breathing. Under the coat she wore a neat blue costume. From some vague
  clue, he thought she was American. A lady undoubtedly, having no association
  with Tidal Basin, unless she was a passenger on the Moroccan boat which
  sailed with the tide from Shrimp Wharf.</p>

  <p>"Is he&mdash;is he dead?" she asked jerkily, and in her dark eyes he read
  an unconquerable fear.</p>

  <p>"Is who dead?"</p>

  <p>He was puzzled; searched his mind rapidly for patients in extremis and
  could find none but old Sully, the marine store dealer, who had been dying
  for eighteen months.</p>

  <p>"The man&mdash;he was brought here... after the fight. A policeman told
  me... they were fighting in the street and he was brought here."</p>

  <p>She stood, her hands clasped, her thin body bent forward towards him,
  breathless.</p>

  <p>"A man?... Oh, yes; he's dead, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>Dr. Marford was for the moment bewildered. How could she be interested in
  the fate of one Stephens, dock labourer, of Poplar?</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!"</p>

  <p>She whispered the words, dropped for a second. Dr. Marford's arm went
  round her and assisted her to a chair.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!" she said again and began to cry.</p>

  <p>He looked at her helplessly, not knowing for whom he could frame a
  defence&mdash;for the dead or the living.</p>

  <p>"It was a fair fight as far as one could see," he said awkwardly. "The man
  fell... hit his head on the sharp edge of the kerb..."</p>

  <p>"I begged him not to go near him," she said a little wildly. "I begged
  him! When he telephoned to say he was on his track and had traced him here...
  I came by cab... I implored him to come back."</p>

  <p>All this and more came incoherently. Dr. Marford had to guess what she
  said. Some of the words were drowned in sobs. He went to his medicine shelf
  and took down a bottle labelled "Ap. Am. Arm.," poured a little into a
  medicine glass and added water.</p>

  <p>"You drink this and tell me all about it," he said authoritatively.</p>

  <p>She told him more than she would have told her confessor. Sorrow, remorse,
  the crushing tragedy of fear removed all inhibitions. The doctor listened,
  looking down at her, twiddling the stem of the medicine glass in his
  fingers.</p>

  <p>Presently he spoke.</p>

  <p>"This man Stephens was a dock labourer&mdash;a heavy fellow, six feet tall
  at least. A fair-haired man. The other man was a young fellow of twenty
  something. I only saw him for a second when he was in the hands of the
  police. He had a light, almost a white, moustache&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stared up at him.</p>

  <p>"Fair... a young man..."</p>

  <p>Dr. Marford held the glass out to her.</p>

  <p>"Drink this; you're hysterical. I hate telling you so."</p>

  <p>But she pushed the glass aside.</p>

  <p>"Stephens&mdash;are you sure? Two, well, two ordinary men?..."</p>

  <p>"Two labourers&mdash;both drunk. It's not unusual in this neighbourhood.
  We have an average of two fights a night. On Saturday nights&mdash;six. It's
  a dull place and they have to do something."</p>

  <p>The colour was coming back to her face. She hesitated, reached for the
  glass, swallowed its contents and made a wry face.</p>

  <p>"Sal volatile... beastly!"</p>

  <p>She wiped her lips with a handkerchief she took from her bag and rose
  unsteadily to her feet.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Doctor. I've been a nuisance. I suppose if I offered to pay
  you for your time you'd be offended."</p>

  <p>"I charge ten cents for a consultation," he said gravely, and she
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"How accommodating you are! You think I am American? I am, of course,
  though I've lived in England since&mdash;oh, for a long time. Thank you,
  Doctor. Have I talked a lot of nonsense, and, if I have, will you forget
  it?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Marford's thin face was in the shadow: he was standing between her and
  the lamp.</p>

  <p>"I won't promise that; but I will not repeat it," he said.</p>

  <p>She did not give him her name: he was wholly incurious. When he offered to
  walk with her until she found a cab, she declined his escort. He stood in the
  drizzling rain and watched her out of sight.</p>

  <p>Police-Constable Hartford came from the direction she had taken and
  stopped to speak.</p>

  <p>"They say that Stephens is dead. Well, if they will drink, they must
  expect trouble. I've never regretted taking the pledge myself&mdash;I'll be
  Chief Templar in our lodge this summer if Gawd spares me. I sent a young
  lady; she was makin' inquiries about Stephens. I didn't know he was gone or
  I'd have told her."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, for not telling her," said Marford.</p>

  <p>He was shy of P.C. Hartford, who was notoriously loquacious and charged
  with strange long words.</p>

  <p>He locked the door and went back to his book, but the corruptions and
  permutations of Madame de Lamballe interested him no more.</p>

  <p>Pulling up the surgery blind, he looked out into the deserted street.
  There was some sort of movement in progress under the shadow of the wall
  which encircles the premises of the Eastern Trading Company.</p>

  <p>He saw a man and a woman talking. There was light enough from the street
  standard to reveal this much. The man was in evening dress, which was
  curious. The white splash of his shirt front was plainly visible. Even
  waiters do not wear their uniform in Tidal Basin.</p>

  <p>Dr. Marford went out and opened the street door as the man and the woman
  walked in opposite directions. Then he saw the third of the trio. He was
  moving towards the man in evening dress, following him quickly. The doctor
  saw the first man stop and turn. There was an exchange of words and a
  scuffle. The man in dress clothes went down like a log, the second bent over
  him and went on quickly and disappeared under the railway arch which crosses
  Endley Street, opposite the Eastern Company's main gateway.</p>

  <p>Dr. Marford watched, fascinated, was on the point of crossing to see what
  had happened to the inanimate heap on the pavement, when the man got up and
  lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>The clock struck ten.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LOUIS LANDOR looked down at the hateful thing he had struck
  to the earth. He lay very still and the hate in Landor's heart was replaced
  by a sudden horror. He glanced across the road. Immediately opposite was a
  doctor's surgery&mdash;a red light burned dimly from a bracket-lamp before
  the house to advertise the profession of its occupant. He saw the door was
  open and somebody was standing there. Should he go for help? The idea came
  and went. His own safety was in question. He hurried along in the shadow of
  the high wall and had reached the railway arch, when right ahead of him
  appeared the shadowy figure of a policeman, and the policeman was coming his
  way. He looked round for some way of escape. There were two great gates on
  his right and in one a small wicket door. In his panic he pushed the door and
  it yielded. By some miracle it had been left unfastened. In a second he was
  inside, felt for the bolt and pushed it home. The policeman passed without
  being conscious of his presence.</p>

  <p>P.C. Hartford was at that moment composing a little speech which he
  intended to deliver at the next lodge meeting, where matters of very
  considerable interest were to be discussed. His thoughts being so centred, it
  was not unlikely that he should miss seeing the fugitive.</p>

  <p>A certain Harry Lamborn, who was by trade a general larcenist, and who at
  that moment was standing in the shelter of a deeply-recessed door on the
  opposite side of the road, had less excuse, except that his eye was on the
  approaching copper and that he had little interest in ordinary civilians.
  That night he had certain plans connected with No. 7 warehouse of the Eastern
  Trading Company, and he was waiting for P.C. Hartford to reach the end of his
  beat and return before he put them into operation.</p>

  <p>He watched the constable's leisurely stride, drew back still farther into
  the recess which afforded him freedom from observation and protection from
  the falling rain, and transferred a collapsible jemmy from one pocket to
  another for greater comfort.</p>

  <p>Hartford could not help seeing the man in evening dress. He stood squarely
  in the middle of the side-walk, wiping the mud from his black overcoat.
  Instantly Hartford descended from the dais of Vice-Templar and became a human
  police constable.</p>

  <p>"Had a fall, sir?" he asked cheerfully.</p>

  <p>The man turned a good-looking face to the officer and smiled. Yet he was
  not wholly amused, for his hands were trembling violently and the whiteness
  of his lips was in odd contrast to his sunburnt face. And when he spoke he
  was so breathless that the words came in gasps. Rain had been falling; there
  was a brown, muddy patch on his overcoat. He looked backward, the way he had
  come, and seemed relieved when he saw nobody.</p>

  <p>"Have I had a fall?" he repeated. "Well, I think I have."</p>

  <p>He looked past the constable. "Did you see the man?"</p>

  <p>Police-Constable Hartford looked back along the deserted stretch of
  pavement.</p>

  <p>"Which man?" he asked, and the other seemed surprised.</p>

  <p>"He went your way; he must have passed you."</p>

  <p>Hartford shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, nobody's passed me."</p>

  <p>The white-lipped man was sceptical.</p>

  <p>"Did he do anything?" asked Hartford.</p>

  <p>"Did he do anything?" The stranger had a trick of repeating questions and
  tinging them with contempt. "He punched me in the jaw, if that's anything. I
  played possum." His face twisted in a smile. "Scared him&mdash;I hope."</p>

  <p>He gave a certain emphasis to the last words. Police-Constable Hartford
  surveyed him with greater interest.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to charge the man?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The other was fixing his white silk neck-cloth and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you could find him if I charged him?" he asked
  sarcastically. "No; let him go."</p>

  <p>"A stranger to you, sir?"</p>

  <p>P.C. Hartford had not handled a case for a month and was loath to let his
  fingers slide off the smooth edge of this.</p>

  <p>"No; I know him."</p>

  <p>"There's a bad crowd about here," began Hartford. "A drunken, dissipated
  &mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I know him, I tell you." The stranger was impatient.</p>

  <p>He dived his hand into an inside pocket, took out a silver case and opened
  it. P.C. Hartford stood by while the man lit his cigarette, and noticed that
  the hand which held the patent lighter was shaking.</p>

  <p>"Here's a drink for you."</p>

  <p>Hartford bridled, and waved aside the proffered coin.</p>

  <p>"I neither touch, taste nor 'andle," he said virtuously, and stood ready
  to pass on his majestic way.</p>

  <p>The stranger unbuttoned his coat and felt in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

  <p>"Lost anything?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said the other with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>He blew a cloud of smoke, nodded, and they separated.</p>

  <p>The man in evening dress came slowly to where a granite-paved roadway
  bisected the path before the gates of the Eastern Trading Company. The thief
  in the covered doorway saw him take his cigarette from his mouth, drop it on
  the pavement and put his foot upon it. And then, suddenly and without
  warning, he saw the white-faced man stagger; his knees gave from under him
  and he went down with a crash to the sidewalk.</p>

  <p>Lamborn was an opportunist&mdash;saw here a gift from heaven in the shape
  of a drunken swell; looked left and right, and crossed the road with stealthy
  footsteps. He did not see Hartford moving towards him in the shadow of the
  wall. Lamborn flicked open the coat of the stricken man, dived in his hand
  and found a note-case. His fingers hooked to a watchguard; he pulled both out
  with a simultaneous jerk and then saw the running policeman. To be arrested
  on suspicion is one thing; to be found in possession of stolen property is
  another. Lamborn's hand jerked up to the high wall which surrounded the
  company's yard, and he turned to fly. Half a dozen paces he took, and then
  the hand of the law fell on him, and the familiar "Here, you!" came hatefully
  to his ears. He struggled impotently. Mr. Lamborn had never learned the first
  lesson of criminality, which is to go quietly.</p>

  <p>Hartford thrust him against the wall, and then saw somebody crossing the
  road, and remembered the man lying under the lamp-post as he recognised the
  figure.</p>

  <p>"Doctor&mdash;that gentleman's hurt. Will you have a look at him?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Marford had seen the stranger fall and stooped gingerly by his
  side.</p>

  <p>"Keep quiet, will yer?" said Hartford indignantly to his struggling
  prisoner.</p>

  <p>His whistle sounded shrilly in the night. There were moments when even
  Lamborn grew intelligent.</p>

  <p>"All right, it's a cop." he said sullenly, and ceased to struggle.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that the policeman heard an exclamation from the
  stooping, peering doctor.</p>

  <p>"Constable&mdash;this man is dead&mdash;stabbed!"</p>

  <p>He held up his hands for the policeman's inspection. In the light of the
  standard Hartford saw they were red with blood.</p>

  <p>Elk, who was at the end of the street keeping a spieling house under
  observation, heard the whistle and came flying towards the sound. Every
  kennel in Tidal Basin heard it and was drawn. Men and women forfeited their
  night's rest rather than lose the thrill of experience; when they heard it
  was no less than murder they purred gratefully that their enterprise was
  rewarded. They came trickling out like rats from their burrows. There was a
  crowd almost before the uniformed police arrived to control it.</p>

  <p>When Elk came back from 'phoning the divisional surgeon the doctor was
  washing his hands in a bucket of water that the policeman had brought for
  him.</p>

  <p>"Mason's at the station; he's coming along."</p>

  <p>"Here, Elk, what's the idea of holding me?"</p>

  <p>Lamborn's voice was pained and hurt. He stood, a wretchedly garbed figure
  of uncouth manhood, between two towering policemen, but his spirit was beyond
  suppression.</p>

  <p>"I've done nothing, have I? This rozzer pinched me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up," said Elk, not unkindly. "Mr. Mason will be along in a
  minute."</p>

  <p>Lamborn groaned.</p>

  <p>"Him!" he almost howled. "Sympathetic Mason, what a night for a
  party!"</p>

  <p>Chief Detective Inspector Mason was visiting his area that night, and was
  in the police station when the call was put through. He came in the long,
  powerful police tender with a host of detectives, and a testy and elderly
  police surgeon. Dr. Rudd was a police surgeon because it offered him the
  maximum interest for the minimum of labour. He was a bachelor, with an
  assured income from investments, but he liked the authority which his
  position gave him; liked to see policemen touching their helmets to him as he
  passed them on the street; was impressed by the support he received from
  magistrates when he declared as having been drunk influential people who
  brought their own doctors from Harley Street to prove that they suffered from
  nothing more vicious than shell-shock.</p>

  <p>He knew Dr. Marford slightly, and favoured him with a cold nod; resented
  his being in the case at all, for the penny doctor was one of the poor
  relations of the profession, not the kind of man one would call into a
  consultation, supposing Dr. Rudd called in anybody.</p>

  <p>He made a careful examination of the still figure.</p>

  <p>"Dead, of course," he said.</p>

  <p>He gave the impression that, had he arrived a little earlier, the tragedy
  might have been averted.</p>

  <p>"There is a knife wound," began Marford, "which penetrated&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said Dr. Rudd impatiently. "Of course. Naturally."</p>

  <p>He looked at Mr. Mason.</p>

  <p>"Dead," he said. "I will make an examination. Obviously a knife wound.
  Death was probably instantaneous."</p>

  <p>He looked at Marfod.</p>

  <p>"Were you here when it happened?"</p>

  <p>"Soon after," said Marford; "a minute after&mdash;probably less than
  that."</p>

  <p>"Ah, then," said Dr. Rudd, his hands in his pockets, his legs apart,
  "you'll be able to tell us something&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mason intervened. He was a bald man, with a humorous eye and a deep,
  unctuous voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, we'll see all about that, Doctor."</p>

  <p>He showed no resentment at this attempt to usurp his function; was almost
  jovial in the face of an impertinence which was not an unusual experience
  when Dr. Rudd was in a case.</p>

  <p>"We'll see all about that. Doctor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Marford."</p>

  <p>"Doctor Marford, you were here when the murder was committed or soon
  after: you'll be able to tell us something, I'm sure. But now naturally
  you're a little upset."</p>

  <p>Marford smiled and shook his head. "There's nothing I can tell you, Mr.
  Mason, except that I saw the man fall."</p>

  <p>"I'm detaining this man, sir." It was Hartford, stiffly saluting, more
  important than a Chief Commissioner on his first case.</p>

  <p>Mason bent down over the body and let the powerful rays of his hand-lamp
  pry into ugly places.</p>

  <p>"Where is the knife?" he asked. "We want to look after that."</p>

  <p>"There is no knife," said Elk, with gloomy satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, sir." P.C. Hartford, unrebuffed, stood regimentally stiff:
  accuser, prosecutor and expositor all in one. "I've got a man here detained
  in custody."</p>

  <p>Mason became aware of his humble subordinate, took him in from the rose on
  the crest of his helmet to the toes of his large, polished boots.</p>

  <p>"He should be at the police station," he said gently.</p>

  <p>It was Elk who explained.</p>

  <p>"I kept the man here, sir, till you arrived."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mason put his little finger in his ear and twiddled it
  impatiently.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said. "It's a pleasure to know that everything is being
  done in strict accordance with the rules of procedure. You seem to have a
  nice bunch of highly intelligent police officers in your division,
  Inspector."</p>

  <p>He addressed Divisional Inspector Bray, who accompanied him; but Bray had
  no sense of humour, and was entirely oblivious of sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"They're a pretty useful lot," he said complacently.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mason looked at the body at his feet, and thence to the man held
  between the two policemen, and back to the body again.</p>

  <p>"No knife... You might search the body, will you, Elk? Help him, will you,
  Shale? Thank you."</p>

  <p>He peered round at the crowd, and there were a few who, desiring at the
  moment to escape his scrutiny, melted quietly into the darkness.</p>

  <p>At any rate he had seemed oblivious of the presence of Dr. Marford, who
  was silent in an atmosphere charged with hostility to penny doctors. Suddenly
  Elk lugged something from beneath the body.</p>

  <p>"Here you are, sir."</p>

  <p>It was a knife sheath, and at the moment was not pleasant to handle. Mr.
  Mason found an old envelope in his pocket and took it carefully.</p>

  <p>"Is the knife there?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Bray had joined the search party and was emphatic on the point. They had
  moved the body slightly.</p>

  <p>"No knife." Mason looked up at the high wall. "It might have been thrown
  over there," he mused.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, sir." Constable Hartford froze to attention.</p>

  <p>"Wait," said Mason. "Now tell me, Doctor, what did you see?"</p>

  <p>He addressed Marford, who, brought suddenly into the ambit of publicity,
  stammered and was ill at ease.</p>

  <p>"I came out of my surgery"&mdash;he pointed awkwardly&mdash;"that place
  with the red light. I&mdash;er&mdash;heard two men fighting&mdash;I thought I
  heard a little altercation before then &mdash;and I went in and got my hat
  and mackintosh&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So you'd have a better view of the fight, eh, Doctor?" Mason smiled
  blandly.</p>

  <p>Marford could return the smile now.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly," he said. "Fights are not a novelty in this particular
  neighbourhood. I was going out to see a case&mdash;a maternity case. When I
  came out I heard the commotion. The policeman was arresting a man when I came
  over&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait," said Mason sharply. "You saw two men fighting&mdash;could you
  distinguish them?"</p>

  <p>"Not plainly," Marford shook his head, "although they were opposite my
  surgery."</p>

  <p>"Very handy for them," said Mason. "Was one of them this man?"</p>

  <p>Marford could not swear. He was rather inclined to think it was. He was
  certain one of them was in evening dress.</p>

  <p>"You don't know him?"</p>

  <p>Marford shook his head again.</p>

  <p>"I should think he's a stranger in this neighbourhood; I've never seen him
  here before. When I saw him lying on the ground I thought that it was a
  resumption of the fight I had witnessed."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mason whistled softly, fixing his eyes just under the doctor's chin.
  Marford thought his collar was awry and put up his hand, but that was a
  practice of Mr. Mason, who was sometimes called "Sympathetic Mason."</p>

  <p>"Hartford." He beckoned the constable forward. "What did you see?"</p>

  <p>P.C. Hartford saluted.</p>

  <p>"Sir," said the constable punctiliously, "I had seen the
  deceased&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A look of weariness passed across the face of Mr. Mason. He was not
  sympathetic with loquacious constables.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, my boy, but you're not in court now, you know. You needn't call
  him 'the deceased.' I don't mind what you call him. You saw him before he
  fell?"</p>

  <p>P.C. Hartford saluted again.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I saw him. He stopped me when I was passing and asked me if I'd
  met a man he'd had an argument with. I said 'No.'"</p>

  <p>"Did he describe the man?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Hartford.</p>

  <p>"He said nothing else?"</p>

  <p>Hartford thought for a long time, and then repeated, as best he could
  remember, all that the white-faced man had said.</p>

  <p>"You didn't meet his assailant&mdash;I mean, you weren't dreaming about
  the beer you were going to have for supper?"</p>

  <p>P.C. Hartford was prepared with an indignant repudiation, but swallowed
  it.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. A few minutes later, when I came back this way, I saw him lying
  under the lamp, and I saw another man walking away and I stopped him. Then I
  saw the doctor coming across. By this time I'd arrested Lamborn, who tried to
  run away."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" said Mason, pained.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lamborn grew voluble. He was running for a doctor, he protested.</p>

  <p>"The man was on the ground before you touched him: is that what you're
  suggesting?" asked Mason.</p>

  <p>The prisoner not only suggested but swore to this fact. He had a witness,
  a woman who carried a can in her hand. She might have preferred to remain
  anonymous, but that natural sense of justice which is the possession of poor
  and innocent people overcame her modesty. She was haled forward into the
  clear circle. She was a respectable woman. She had seen the man fall, had
  been a witness of Lamborn going across to him. If she had any private views
  as to the motive for his attentions she wisely restrained them.</p>

  <p>Mason looked at her thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"What is in that can?" he asked.</p>

  <p>There was a lid to the can. All her inclinations were against satisfying
  his curiosity, but she had a respect for the law and told the truth.</p>

  <p>"Beer."</p>

  <p>Mason seemed oblivious of the dead man behind him, of the thief in
  custody, and of the very existence of secret murderers who stalked their prey
  on the highway.</p>

  <p>"Beer&mdash;that's funny." A clock chimed half-past ten. "Why are you
  carrying beer about the street at half-past ten, Mrs.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her name was Albert. She had no explanation for the beer, except, she
  explained tremulously, that she was taking it home. There was a sympathetic
  murmur in the crowd. An anonymous revolutionary said "Leave the woman alone!"
  There are always voices that offer the same advice to policemen in all parts
  of the world in similar circumstances.</p>

  <p>P.C. Hartford was desperate. He had something to say&mdash;something
  vital, a solution which would sweep aside all the cobwebs of mystery which
  surrounded the pitiful heap lying under the electric light standard and
  yielding very little to the busy men who were searching it.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to say, sir, that I saw this man throwing something over the
  wall."</p>

  <p>Mason looked at the wall, as though he expected it to give confirmation of
  this statement.</p>

  <p>"Lamborn, you mean?" He glanced keenly at the thief and jerked his head
  significantly. "Take him away," he said; "I'll see him at the station."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lamborn went between two policemen, hurling back sanguinary defiance.
  There is something of a terrier in the habitual crook: he stands up to
  punishment most gallantly.</p>

  <p>"I'll see you at the station, too, ma'am," said Mason.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Albert nearly dropped her can in her agitation. She was a married
  woman with four children, and had never entered a police station in her
  life.</p>

  <p>"It's never too late to learn," said Mason sympathetically.</p>

  <p>Another ambulance came, one of the baser kind, hand-pushed, and then a
  police car, with photographers, cheerful finger-print experts and men of the
  Identification Bureau. Wilful murder lost its romance and passed into its
  business stage.</p>

  <p>"Just plain murder," said Mason to his subordinates as he moved towards
  his car. "One or two queer features about it, though."</p>

  <p>And then through the crowd came a woman. He thought she was a girl, but in
  the cruel light of the arc lamp saw that she had left girlhood a long way
  behind her. She was white-faced, wide-eyed, a ghost of a woman; her trembling
  lips parted, for the moment inarticulate. She stared from one to the other.
  Dr. Marford, from the shadows, watched her curiously; knew her for Lorna
  Weston, a lady of uncertain profession.</p>

  <p>"Is it&mdash;he?"</p>

  <p>Her voice, starting as a croak, ended in a wail.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Mason stood squarely before her.</p>

  <p>"I'm&mdash;I live around here." She spoke spasmodically; every sentence
  seemed an effort. "He came to see me to-night, and I warned him... of the
  danger. You see, I&mdash;I know my husband. He's a devil! I somehow know
  it."</p>

  <p>"Your husband killed this man, eh?"</p>

  <p>She tried to push past him, but he held her back with some difficulty, for
  fear had given this frail body the strength of a man.</p>

  <p>"Steady, steady, my girl. It may not be your friend at all. What's his
  name?"</p>

  <p>"Donald&mdash;" She checked herself. "May I see him?... I'll tell
  you."</p>

  <p>But Mr. Mason must proceed methodically, in the way of his kind,
  consolidating the foundations of fact.</p>

  <p>"This is what you say, that this man came to visit you to-night, and you
  warned him against your husband. Now, is your husband living in this
  area?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him blankly. He realised that her mind was not upon his
  questions and repeated it.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said. There was a certain defiance in her voice.</p>

  <p>"Where does your husband live? What's his name?"</p>

  <p>She was moving from side to side, and stooped once to look under his arm
  at the still thing on the ground,</p>

  <p>"Let me see him," she pleaded. "I shan't faint... it may not be he. I'm
  sure it's not he. Let me see him!" Her voice was a whine now.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mason nodded to Elk, and Elk took her by the arm and led her to where
  the man lay, half in and half out of the circle of light. She looked down,
  speechless; opened her lips but could say nothing. And then:</p>

  <p>"Donald... he did it! The swine! The murderer!"</p>

  <p>She stopped speaking. Elk felt her sagging away from him and caught her
  round the waist. The Tidal Basin crowd watched the drama. It was well worth
  the loss of a night's sleep.</p>

  <p>Mason looked round, caught Marford's eye and beckoned him forward.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind taking this woman to the station? I think it's only a
  faint."</p>

  <p>Dr. Marford protested wearily. He and a policeman carried the woman to a
  closed police car and they drove off. Outside a chemist's shop at the end of
  Basin Street, Marford stopped the car and sent the constable to ring the
  night bell; but the restorative he secured did not bring the woman back to
  consciousness. She was still silent when he got her to the station.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mason, waiting for the return of the car, delivered himself of certain
  observations.</p>

  <p>"There's murder plain and murder coloured," he said to the patient
  Inspector Bray. "This is murder plain. No music, no fireworks, no lady's
  boudoir, nothing sexy. A man stabbed to death under three pairs of eyes and
  nobody saw the murderer. No knife, no motive, no clue, no name of the dear
  departed."</p>

  <p>"The woman," began Bray, "talked about a devil&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let's keep religion out of it," said Mason wearily. "Who was the man that
  threw the knife, and how did he get it back again? That's the mystery that's
  beating me."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">QUIGLEY, crime man of the Post-Courier and arch-inventor of
  devils, telephoned through to his newspaper:</p>

  <p>"The devil of Tidal Basin is again abroad. This slinking and sinister
  shadow passed unseen through deserted Endley Street and left a dead man
  sprawling upon the sidewalk, stabbed to the heart. Whence he came, whither he
  went, none knows. Under the eyes of three independent witnesses, including
  Mrs. Albert, the wife of the night watchman at the Eastern Trading Company,
  Dr. Warley" (names were Quigley's weak point), "a highly respected medical
  practitioner, and Police-Constable Hartford, an innocent pedestrian was seen
  to stagger and fall. When the horrified spectators reached his side they were
  dumbfounded to see that he was stabbed. The identity of the murdered man has
  not yet been established. Who was this stranger in evening dress, wandering
  in the purlieus of Tidal Basin? What ruthless hand destroyed him, and in what
  mysterious manner did the unseen murderer make his escape? These are the
  questions which Central Detective Mason has to solve. Mason, one of the Big
  Five, was fortunately in the neighbourhood, and immediately took charge of
  the case. A man has been detained, but is he the devil of Tidal Basin?"</p>

  <p>("Cut out all that devil stuff," said the night editor as he handed the
  copy to a sub. "It's been overworked.")</p>

  <p>Elk came to the police station and into the inspector's room, where Mason
  was sitting, ten minutes after his chief arrived. He laid two articles on the
  table before the great man.</p>

  <p>"That night watchman takes a lot of waking. By the way, he's the husband
  of Mrs. Albert&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The woman with the beer?"</p>

  <p>Elk nodded.</p>

  <p>"I found these in the yard&mdash;obviously Lamborn threw them over when he
  saw the policeman."</p>

  <p>He enumerated his finds.</p>

  <p>"Notebook and watch; glass broken, watch stopped at ten p.m. Swiss made,
  and has the name of a Melbourne jeweller on the face."</p>

  <p>Mason examined the watch.</p>

  <p>"Careful," warned Elk. "There's a smudgy thumb-print on the back."</p>

  <p>Mason shifted his chair a little, and invited Elk by a gesture to draw
  another up to his side.</p>

  <p>"What else?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Elk took from an inside pocket a quantity of loose paper money and put it
  on the table. The pocket-case, which also contained a memorandum book, he
  opened, and extracted two new bank-notes, each for a hundred pounds. On their
  backs was the stamp of the Maida Vale branch of the Midland Bank; it was a
  round rubber stamp, and in the centre was a date line.</p>

  <p>"Issued yesterday."</p>

  <p>"If he'd got an account there&mdash;" began Elk.</p>

  <p>Mason shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He hadn't. You don't draw hundred-pound notes out of your own account and
  carry them about with you. You draw them out because you want to send them
  away. You couldn't change a hundred-pound note in London without running the
  risk of being arrested. No, these notes were drawn from somebody else's
  account and given to him. Which means that he hasn't a banking account of his
  own or they'd have been paid in. Therefore he's not in trade, or he'd have a
  banking account."</p>

  <p>Elk sniffed.</p>

  <p>"Sounds like the well-known Shylock Holmes to me," he said.</p>

  <p>He was a contemporary of Mason's who had missed promotion, and his
  sarcasms were licensed. "What else?" asked Mason.</p>

  <p>"Visiting-cards&mdash;any number of them." Elk took them out and laid them
  on the table. Mason examined them carefully. There were addresses in
  Birmingham and Leicester and London, but a large proportion of them were the
  visiting cards of people who had a permanent address in South Africa.</p>

  <p>"All the same colour," he said. "They've all been collected within a
  couple of months. That means he's been a sea voyage lately&mdash;it's
  extraordinary how people give away their cards to perfect strangers when
  they're taking an ocean trip."</p>

  <p>He looked at the backs of one or two of them; there were pencilled notes.
  One said: "£10,000 a year"; another: "Made a lot of money in Namaqualand
  Diamonds; staying Ritz, London."</p>

  <p>Mason smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you two guesses as to what his trade is." He picked up a third
  card; this time the inscription on the back was in ink: "Cheque stopped; Adam
  &amp; Sills."</p>

  <p>"I'll give you one guess now. He's a crook and a card-sharp. Adam &amp;
  Sills are the lawyers who do the barking for these kind of birds. That places
  him. Now we'll find his name. Get on to the Yard, tell 'em to call every
  hotel, big and small, in the West End, and find if a man has arrived there
  from abroad. Say that his first name is Donald. You'll find out where he came
  from&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Cape Town," said Elk.</p>

  <p>Mason nodded. "I expected that. How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"His boots are new; they've got a tag to them, 'Cleghorn, Adderley
  Street.'"</p>

  <p>"Then make it South Africa," said Mason. Elk was half-way across the room
  when Mason shouted him back.</p>

  <p>"Ask the bureau to give you the name, private address and telephone number
  of the manager of the Maida Vale branch of the Midland Bank. Wait a minute,
  don't rush me&mdash;tell the bureau to get on to the manager and find if he
  remembers on whose account two notes for a hundred pounds" &mdash;he
  scribbled down the numbers on a slip of paper and handed them to
  Elk&mdash;"were issued, and, if possible, to whom they were issued. I've got
  an idea we shan't discover that."</p>

  <p>When Elk returned, Mr. Mason was sitting, chin in hand, his heavy, round
  face more than ordinarily blank. "I'll see Lamborn," he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lamborn was brought from the detention-room, voluble and
  truculent.</p>

  <p>"If there's a law in this country&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"There isn't," said Mr. Mason genially. "You've broken 'em all. Sit down,
  Harry."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lamborn looked at him suspiciously. "You goin' to be sympathetic?" he
  asked. The glamour of legend surrounded Mr. Mason. He was indeed a
  sympathetic man, and under the genial influence of his understanding and
  sympathetic heart many wrongdoers had, with misguided confidence, told him
  much more than they ever intended to tell, a fact which they had bitterly
  regretted when they stood before a jury and heard their frankness exploited
  with disastrous effect.</p>

  <p>Mason beamed.</p>

  <p>"I can't be wicked with you fellows&mdash;naturally I can't." His voice
  was at its most unctuous. "Life's a bit difficult for all of us, and I know
  just how hard it is for some of you birds to get an honest living."</p>

  <p>"I dessay," said Lamborn icily.</p>

  <p>"You never do any harm, Harry"&mdash;Mr. Mason laid his hand upon the
  other's knee and patted it softly&mdash;"by telling the police all you know.
  It isn't much, because, if you knew enough to come in out of the rain, you
  wouldn't be thieving for a living. But this is a case of murder."</p>

  <p>"Nobody says I did it," said Lamborn quickly.</p>

  <p>"Nobody says so at the moment," agreed Mr. Mason pleasantly; "but you
  never can tell what stories get around. You know Tidal Basin, Harry
  &mdash;they'd swear your life away for a slice of pineapple. Now let's be
  perfectly open and above-board."</p>

  <p>He leaned back in his chair and surveyed the other with fatherly
  benevolence.</p>

  <p>"The constable saw you go over to this man and put your hand in his
  pocket, take out a pocket-book and possibly a watch. When you were detected
  you threw them over the wall, where they have since been found by
  Detective-Sergeant Elk. Isn't that so, Elk?"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about 'em," said Lamborn loudly, and Mr. Mason shook his
  head with a sad smile.</p>

  <p>"You saw this fellow fall and you thought he was soused. You went over and
  you dipped him for his clock and pack."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand what you're talking about," said Mr. Lamborn rapidly.
  "I've never heard such expressions in me life."</p>

  <p>"Let me put it in plain English," said Mason gently. "You put your hand in
  his pocket and took out his pocket-case and his watch."</p>

  <p>"That," said Lamborn emphatically, "is a damn dirty lie'."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mason sighed, and looked at Elk despairingly.</p>

  <p>"What can you do with 'em?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't want none of your sympathy," said the ungracious Lamborn.
  "There's too many people in stir through listening to your smarming. I see
  the gentleman fall and I went over to render him assistance."</p>

  <p>"Medical assistance, I'm sure," murmured Mason, "you being an M.D. of
  Dartmoor and having learnt first aid at Wormwood Scrubs. Now come across,
  Harry. You can save me a lot of trouble by telling the truth."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;" began Lamborn</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment." The reservoir of Mr. Mason's urbanity was running low and
  his voice was a little sharper. "If you'll tell me the truth I'll undertake
  not to charge you. I shall hold you as a Crown witness&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look here, Mr. Mason," said Lamborn hotly, "what sort of a can do you
  think I am? I've been treated disgraceful since I've been at this station.
  They stripped me naked and took all me clothes away. They haven't even a
  sense of decency! Give me these old duds to put on. And why did they take me
  clothes away? To frame up evidence by puttin' stuff in me pocket&mdash;I know
  the police!"</p>

  <p>Mason sighed, and when he spoke it was very deliberately and
  offensively.</p>

  <p>"If you had a little more brains you'd be half-witted," he said. "That's
  not an original remark, but it applies. There are men twice as sane as you
  living in padded cells. You poor, ignorant gutter scum, don't you understand
  that your clothes were taken away to see if there was any blood on them, and
  that your dirty hands were examined for the same reason? And don't you
  realise that a man of my rank wouldn't trouble even to spit at you if he
  hadn't a very good reason? I don't want you for murder&mdash;get that into
  your sawdust. I don't even want you for robbery. I want you to tell me the
  truth: did you, or did you not, dip this man when he was lying on the ground?
  And if you tell me the truth I'll utter no against you. Let me tell you
  this." He leaned forward and tapped the other's knee with a heavy knuckle.
  "You won't be able to understand it, but I'm doing my duty when I tell you.
  The whole of this case may swing upon whether you make a voluntary statement
  that you took this man's pocket-case out of his pocket&mdash;the watch
  doesn't matter &mdash;whilst he was lying on the ground, or that you did
  not."</p>

  <p>"I didn't," said Lamborn loudly. "I defy you to prove it!"</p>

  <p>The chief inspector groaned.</p>

  <p>"Take him away before I forget myself," he said simply.</p>

  <p>Elk gripped the arm of his prisoner and marched him to the desk.</p>

  <p>"You fool," he said en route, "why didn't you speak?"</p>

  <p>Lamborn snorted.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't I speak?" he demanded scornfully. "Blimey, look what I'm
  getting for saying nothin'!"</p>

  <p>A minute later he was charged before an apathetic station-sergeant, and
  went noisily to the cells.</p>

  <p>Elk came back to his chief with information that had come through whilst
  the charge was in progress.</p>

  <p>"The two notes were issued on the account of Mr. Louis Landor, of Teign
  Court, Maida Vale. Landor is either an American or has lived in America. He's
  an engineer, a fairly rich man, and drew out another three thousand pounds
  this morning&mdash;he's going abroad."</p>

  <p>"Bon voyage to him," said Mason, in a cynical humour. "Going abroad, is
  he?"</p>

  <p>He gazed at the knife-sheath lying on a sheet of paper before him, and
  pointed with his little finger to ornate initials engraved on a small gold
  plate.</p>

  <p>"L.L.&mdash;they may stand for Leonard Lowe: on the other hand, they may
  stand for Louis Landor.'</p>

  <p>"Who's Leonard Lowe?" asked Elk, momentarily dense.</p>

  <p>"There is no such person," said the superintendent patiently. "Listen,
  Elk&mdash;living in Tidal Basin hasn't sharpened your wits, has it? I'll be
  moving you to the West End soon&mdash;'C' Division. You'll shine amongst that
  batch of suckers."</p>

  <p>He got up from the table and walked heavily through the charge-room to the
  little apartment which the police matron used as a duty-room, lay Lorna
  Weston; her face was pale, her lips colourless.</p>

  <p>"She might be dead," said Mason.</p>

  <p>Dr. Marford sighed, took out his cheap American watch and looked at
  it.</p>

  <p>"So might be quite a large number of my patients," he said listlessly. "I
  don't know whether you're interested in the phenomena of life and death, Mr.
  Mason&mdash;my own interest is strictly professional &mdash;but at this
  moment there is a lady waiting for me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," interrupted Mason good-humouredly. "We forget nothing. I've
  arranged for your district nurse to phone you through to the station. We'll
  have to do something with this woman."</p>

  <p>He looked dubiously down at the still figure on the bed, moved slightly
  the blanket that covered her and felt her hand.</p>

  <p>"She's a dope?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Dr. Marford nodded.</p>

  <p>"I found a hypodermic in her bag," he said.</p>

  <p>"Rudd thinks she should be taken a hospital or infirmary."</p>

  <p>Marford assented reluctantly. Here was the inevitable key witness, and he
  was loath to leave her out of his sight.</p>

  <p>Rudd came bustling in importantly.</p>

  <p>"I've fixed a bed at the infirmary." he said. "Of course they told me they
  had no accommodation, but as soon as I mentioned my name&mdash;" He smiled
  jovially at Marford. "Now if it had been you dear fellow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have asked. I should simply have taken the case there and
  they'd have had to find a bed for her." said Marford.</p>

  <p>Dr. Rudd was a little ruffled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes; but that is hardly the way, is it? I mean, there are certain
  professional&mdash;um&mdash;courtesies to be observed. The resident surgeon
  is a friend of mine, as it happens&mdash;Grennett; he was with me at
  Guy's."</p>

  <p>He dropped Marford as being unworthy of his confidence, and addressed the
  superintendent.</p>

  <p>"I'm getting the ambulance down right away."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen the man again?" asked Mason.</p>

  <p>"The man?" Dr. Rudd frowned. "Oh, you mean the dead man? Yes. Your Mr. Elk
  was there, searching him. I made one or two observations which I think may be
  useful to you, Superintendent. For instance, there's a bruise on the left
  cheek."</p>

  <p>Mason nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he was fighting. Dr. Marford saw that."</p>

  <p>Rudd was called away at that moment, and bustled out with an apology. The
  very apology was offensive to Mr. Mason, for it inferred that investigations
  were momentarily suspended until the police surgeon returned.</p>

  <p>The woman on the bed showed no sign of life. The doctor, at Mason's
  request, exhibited two tiny punctures on the left arm.</p>

  <p>"Recently made," he explained, "but there's no evidence that she's an
  addict. I can find no other punctures, for example, and the mere fact that
  the shot has had such an extraordinarily deadening effect upon her rather
  suggests that she's a novice."</p>

  <p>He lifted the arm and dropped it; it fell lifelessly.</p>

  <p>"When will she recover consciousness?"</p>

  <p>Marford shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. At present she's not in a state where I could recommend
  giving restoratives, but I'll leave that to the infirmary people. The
  resident surgeon is a personal friend of Dr. Rudd's and is therefore in all
  probability a man of genius."</p>

  <p>The eyes of the two men met. Mr. Mason did not attempt to disguise his own
  amusement.</p>

  <p>"Fine," he said. And then: "Have you ever been in a murder case
  before?"</p>

  <p>The doctor's lips twitched with the hint of a smile.</p>

  <p>"Manslaughter&mdash;this evening," he said. "No, I have not been called in
  professionally. Not one doctor in eight thousand ever attends a murder case
  in the whole course of his practice&mdash;not if he's wise," he added.</p>

  <p>Mason became suddenly interested in this shabby figure with the pained
  eyes and the thin, starved face.</p>

  <p>"You find living not particularly pleasant in this neighbourhood, Doctor?
  Couldn't you work your clinic somewhere more salubrious?"</p>

  <p>Marford shrugged.</p>

  <p>"It's all one to me," he said. "My own wants are very few and they are
  satisfied. The clinic must be where it is wanted. For myself, I do not crave
  for the society of intellectual men, because intellectual men bore me."</p>

  <p>"And you've no theory about this murder?"</p>

  <p>Mason's good-humoured eyes were smiling again.</p>

  <p>The doctor did not answer immediately; he bit his lip and looked
  thoughtfully past the superintendent.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said quietly. "To my mind, this case is obviously a case of
  revenge. He was not murdered for profit, he was deliberately assassinated to
  right some wrong probably committed years before. And it was not in the
  larger sense premeditated: the murder was committed on the spur of the moment
  as opportunity offered."</p>

  <p>Mason stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

  <p>"Because I think it." Marford was smiling. "Unless you believe that this
  man was definitely lured to this spot with the object of killing him, and
  that a most elaborate scheme was formed for enticing him into this
  neighbourhood, you must believe that it was unpremeditated."</p>

  <p>Superintendent Mason, fists on hips, legs wide apart, peered at
  Marford.</p>

  <p>"You're not one of these amateur detectives I've been reading about,
  Doctor?" he challenged. "The sort of man who's going to make the police look
  foolish in chapter thirty-nine and take all the credit for the discovery?"
  Then unexpectedly he clapped his hand on Marford's bony shoulder. "You talk
  sense, anyway, and every doctor doesn't talk that. I could name you one, but
  you'd probably report me to the British Medical Association. You're quite
  right&mdash;your theory is my theory."</p>

  <p>And then, suddenly: "Do you exclude the possibility that Lamborn may have
  knifed him?"</p>

  <p>"Entirely," said the other emphatically, and Mason nodded.</p>

  <p>"I might tell you"&mdash;he dropped his voice confidentially &mdash;"that
  that is the ground plan of Dr. Rudd's theory."</p>

  <p>"He has another," said Marford. "I wonder he hasn't told you."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MASON looked down at the woman again. She had not moved, so
  far as the eye could see had not even breathed, since she came in.</p>

  <p>"She's got it locked up there." He touched the white forehead lightly.
  "No, it's an ordinary police case, Doctor. Everything looks mysterious until
  somebody squeals, and then the case is so easy that even a poor old gentleman
  from Scotland Yard could work it out."</p>

  <p>He frowned at the woman.</p>

  <p>"All right, shoot her into hospital," he said brusquely, and returned to
  his room.</p>

  <p>It was Inspector Bray's room really; a cupboard of a place, with a table
  and chair, a last year's almanac on the wall, two volumes of the Police Code,
  a telephone list a foot long&mdash;and three reprints of popular fiction.
  They were decently hidden from view by the Police Code, and Mr. Mason took
  one down to the table and opened it.</p>

  <p>A taste for thrilling fiction is not phenomenal in a detective officer.
  With this particular story Mr. Mason was well acquainted, and he turned the
  leaves casually and disparagingly. Here was a murder the like of which never
  came the way of the average police officer. There were beautiful ladies
  involved, ladies who had their own Rolls-Royces and lived in exotic
  apartments; gentlemen who dressed for dinner every night&mdash;even the
  detectives did that. Here murder had a colour and a fragrance; it was set in
  scenes of beauty, in half-timbered country houses, with lawns that sloped
  down to a quiet river; in Park Lane mansions, where nothing less than a
  footman in resplendent uniform could find the dead body of his master lying
  by the side of a broken Sevres vase. High politics came into the story;
  ministers of state were suspected; powerful cars sped seaward to where the
  steam cutter was waiting to carry its murderous owner to his floating den of
  vice.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mason shook his head, scratched his cheek and closed the book, and
  returned to his own murder, to the drabness of Tidal Basin, with its
  innumerable side streets and greasy pavements, jerry-built houses all of a
  plan, where three families lived in a space inadequate for a Park Lane
  bath-room. Silent Tidal Basin, with its swing bridges over the narrow
  entrance to docks, and its cold electric standards revealing ugliness even on
  the darkest night. People were living and dying here; one death more or less
  surely made no difference. But because a man who was a card-sharp, probably a
  blackguard, had met his just end, there were lights burning in all sorts of
  odd rooms at Scotland Yard, men searching records, a printing press working
  at feverish speed, police cyclists flying to the ends of the area carrying
  the wet sheets which described the dead man, and in ten thousand streets and
  squares policemen were reading, by the light of their electric lamps, the
  description of a man unknown, killed by one known even less.</p>

  <p>The machinery was working; the wheels and pistons whirled and
  thundered&mdash;purposeless, it would seem, save to entertain the tall men on
  their lonely beats with first-hand news of tragedy.</p>

  <p>Mason got up and walked out to the entrance of the station. A dim blue
  light painted his bronzed cheek a sickly hue. The street was deserted. Rain
  was falling steadily; every window of every house that faced the station was
  black and menacing.</p>

  <p>Why he shivered he did not know. He was too serious a police officer to be
  influenced by atmosphere. And yet the unfriendliness of this area, all its
  possibilities of evil, penetrated his armour of indifference.</p>

  <p>A queer, boozy lot of people... A thought struck him, and he slapped the
  palm of his hand. There were three C.I.D. men in the charge-room; he called
  them and gave them instructions.</p>

  <p>"Take a couple of guns," he said. "You may need them."</p>

  <p>After he had seen them depart, he sent an urgent phone message to Scotland
  Yard. Then he went across to where Dr. Marford was standing, talking to the
  station clerk.</p>

  <p>"What about this man with the white mask? You know everything that happens
  in this pitch. Is it a yarn, or is there any foundation for it? There used to
  be a man up west&mdash;had some sort of accident that upset his
  features&mdash;he used to wear that kind of thing."</p>

  <p>The doctor nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"I think that is the man I have met," he said.</p>

  <p>"You've met him?" asked Mason in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Why he wore the mask I have never been able to understand, because
  there was really very little wrong with his face, except a large red scar. He
  wasn't exactly good to look at&mdash;but you can say that of a lot of people
  who don't wear masks. I've seen thousands looking worse."</p>

  <p>Mason scowled and pursed his lips.</p>

  <p>"I remember the West End man. I see that some of the newspapers are
  recalling the fact that he was seen years ago. If I remember rightly, he
  lived in a top flat in Jermyn Street. He had permission from the Commissioner
  to go out with this thing on his face. I haven't seen him for years, but I
  remember him well. What was his name&mdash;West something &mdash;not
  Weston?"</p>

  <p>The doctor shrugged.</p>

  <p>"I never knew his name. He came to me about three years ago and asked for
  ray treatment. He was stupidly sensitive and only came after he had fixed the
  interview up by telephone. He's been several times since, round about
  midnight, and he invariably pays me a pound."</p>

  <p>Mason thought for a while, then went to the telephone and called a central
  police station off Regent Street. The sergeant in charge remembered the man
  at once, but was not sure of his name.</p>

  <p>"He hasn't been seen round the West End for years," he said. "The Yard has
  been arguing about him&mdash;wondering if he was White Face."</p>

  <p>"Was his name Weston?" suggested Mason, but the sergeant was without
  information.</p>

  <p>Mason came back to the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Does this man live in the neighbourhood?"</p>

  <p>But here Dr. Marford could tell him nothing. The first time he had met his
  queer patient he had undoubtedly lived in the region of Piccadilly;
  thereafter he had only appeared at irregular intervals.</p>

  <p>"Do you think he's our devil?" asked Mason bluntly, and the lean man
  chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Devil! It's queer how normal people attribute devilry to any man or woman
  who is afflicted&mdash;the hunchback and the misshapen, the cross-eyed and
  the lame. You're almost medieval, Mr. Mason."</p>

  <p>He could say very little that might assist the police, except that he no
  longer received warning when the man with the mask made his appearance.
  Invariably he came through the little yard that ran by the side of the
  surgery into the passage which Dr. Marford's patients used when they queued
  up for their medicine.</p>

  <p>"I never have the side door locked&mdash;I mean the door that goes into
  the yard." Marford explained that he was a very heavy sleeper, and it was not
  unusual for his clients to come right into the house to wake him, and the
  first intimation of their needs was a knock on his bedroom door.</p>

  <p>"I've nothing to lose except a few instruments and a few bottles of
  poison; and to do these fellows justice, I've never had a thing stolen from
  me since I've been in the neighbourhood. I treat these people like friends,
  and so long as they're reasonably wholesome I don't mind their wandering
  about the house."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mason made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"How can you live here? You're a gentleman, you have education. How can
  you meet them every day, listen to their miseries, see their dirt
  &mdash;ugh!"</p>

  <p>Dr. Marford sighed and looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"If that child's normal he's born," he said, and at that moment the
  sergeant called him across to the telephone at the desk.</p>

  <p>The child had been normal and had made his appearance into the world
  without the doctor's assistance. The male parent, a careful man, was already
  disputing the right of the doctor to any fee. Dr. Marford had had previous
  experience of a similar character, and knew that for the fact that the baby
  arrived before the doctor came the mother would claim and receive the fullest
  credit.</p>

  <p>"Half fee, as usual," he told the district nurse and hung up the
  receiver.</p>

  <p>"I used to charge half fees, but double visiting fees if I was called in
  afterwards. That didn't work, because the mother was usually dead before they
  risked the expense of calling me in. The economy of these people is
  excessive."</p>

  <p>The ambulance was ready. He and Rudd saw the woman placed in charge of a
  uniformed nurse, and Sergeant Elk appointed a detective officer to accompany
  the patient to the infirmary.</p>

  <p>Elk was silent, and his eyes were preternaturally bright when he lounged
  into the inspector's room.</p>

  <p>"This is a case which ought to get me promotion," he said, a shameless
  thing to say in the presence of a man who expected most of the kudos. "Here
  I've been working for years, and this is the first real mystery I've struck.
  More like a book than a police case. Quigley's nosing round the
  neighbourhood&mdash;I shouldn't be surprised if he didn't turn in a new
  devil. It's a good story for him."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mason indicated a chair.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, my poor fellow," he said with spurious sympathy. "What are the
  features of this murder which have separated it from an ordinary case of
  knifing?"</p>

  <p>Elk's long arm went out, and he pointed in a direction which Mr. Mason,
  not wholly acquainted with the geography of the station, decided was the
  matron's room.</p>

  <p>"She's it!" said Elk. His voice shook. "What happened to-night, Mr. Mason?
  An unknown man has a fight with another unknown man, who bolts. The first
  fellow walks along and meets a police officer and tells him all about it.
  He's alive and well; obviously he's not stabbed; yet within a few seconds
  after the officer moves on, this fellow drops in his track like a man shot. A
  cheap crook comes over and dips him, and is seen by Hartford, who tackles the
  man. They then discover that the fellow on the ground is stabbed. Nobody saw
  the blow struck. Yet there he is dead &mdash;knifed, and the knife's well
  away and can't be found."</p>

  <p>Mason leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"End of the first reel; the second reel will follow immediately," he
  murmured, but Elk was undisturbed. That bright light in his eye was now a
  steely glitter. He was agitated as he had never been seen before in all the
  years of his service.</p>

  <p>"Out of nowhere comes Mrs. Weston. She'd warned this man he was going to
  be killed. She wants to be sure that it is him."</p>

  <p>"He," murmured Mason gently.</p>

  <p>"Never mind about grammar." Elk was frankly insubordinate in his
  vehemence. "She takes a look at the man on the ground and drops."</p>

  <p>He laid his hand almost violently upon the superintendent's arm and shook
  it.</p>

  <p>"I was watching her. I knew the woman, though I didn't recognise her at
  first. She drops&mdash;and what do we find? She's a needler&mdash;a dope.
  Does that mean anything to you, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you said 'sir,'" said Mason. "I was wondering how I'd bring you
  back to a sense of discipline. Yes, it means a lot to me. Now I'm going to
  ask you a question: does the can of beer which Mrs. Albert was carrying mean
  anything to you, and does that can of beer associate itself in your active
  and intelligent mind with the disappearance of Mr. Louis Landor&mdash;if
  that's the name of the man who fought with the dead one?"</p>

  <p>Elk was frankly bewildered.</p>

  <p>"You're trying to pull my leg."</p>

  <p>"Heaven forbid!" said the patient Mason. "Bring in Mrs. Albert. She's
  waited long enough to get three kinds of panic&mdash;I want her to have the
  kind where she'll tell the truth."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Albert came, a rather pale woman, sensible of her disgraceful
  surroundings, conscious, too, of her responsibility for four children, only
  three of which, Mason learned, were yet born. She still clutched in her hand
  the tell-tale can of beer. The liquid was now flat and uninviting and some of
  it had spilt in her agitation, so that she brought with her to the
  inspector's room a faint aroma of synthetic hops. She was quivering, more or
  less speechless. Mason gave her no opportunity for recovering her
  self-possession or her volubility.</p>

  <p>"Sorry I've had to keep you so long, Mrs. Albert," he said. "Your
  husband's the night watchman at the Eastern Trading Company, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>She nodded mutely.</p>

  <p>"The Eastern Trading Company do not allow their night watchman to have
  beer?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Albert found her voice.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," she piped. "The last night watchman got the sack for drinking
  when he was on duty."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Mason, at his most brusque. "But your husband likes a drop
  of beer, and it's fairly easy to pass the beer through the wicket gate, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>She could only blink at him pathetically.</p>

  <p>"And he's in the habit of leaving the wicket gate undone every night about
  eleven o'clock, and you're in the habit of putting that can inside the
  gate?"</p>

  <p>Her pathos grew. She could only suspect a base informer, and was undecided
  as to which of her five neighbours had filled that despicable role.</p>

  <p>She was not unpretty, Mason noticed in his critical way, despite the three
  children&mdash;or four, if her worst fears were realised.</p>

  <p>The superintendent turned to his subordinate.</p>

  <p>"There's the connection," he said, "and that is where Mr. Louis Landor
  went&mdash;through the wicket gate. Oh, you needn't bother: I've sent some
  men to search the yard. But if I am any judge, Mr. Landor has gone. I've
  already circulated his description."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Albert, the wife of the night watchman, drooped guiltily in her
  chair, her agonised dark eyes fixed on Mr. Mason. Here was tragedy for her,
  more poignant than the death of unknown men struck down by unseen forces; the
  tragedy of a husband dismissed from the only job he had held in five years,
  of the resumption of that daily struggle for life, of aimless wanderings for
  employment on his part&mdash;she could always go out as a hired help for a
  few shillings a day.</p>

  <p>"He'll get the sack," she managed to breathe.</p>

  <p>Mason looked at her and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm not reporting to the Eastern Trading Company, though you might have
  helped a little bit if you hadn't hidden up the truth when I asked you about
  the beer. I blame myself for not realising that you had something to hide,
  and what it was. It might have made a big difference."</p>

  <p>"You're not reporting it, mister?" she asked tremulously, and was on the
  verge of tears. "I've had a very hard time. That poor woman could tell you
  how hard it was: she used to live with me till she came into money."</p>

  <p>"Which poor woman is this?" asked Mason quickly.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Weston."</p>

  <p>She had lost some of her fear in the face of his interest.</p>

  <p>"She lodged with you?"</p>

  <p>Elk had left the room. Mason motioned her to the chair which the sergeant
  had vacated and which was nearer to him.</p>

  <p>"Come along and let's hear all about it," he said genially.</p>

  <p>A bald man, with a round, amused face and a ready smile, removed all her
  natural suspicions.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, sir, she used to lodge with me, till she got this money."</p>

  <p>"Where did she get the money from?"</p>

  <p>"Gawd knows," said Mrs. Albert piously. "I never ask questions. She paid
  me all that she owed me, that's all I know. I've been wondering, sir"
  &mdash;she leaned forward confidentially&mdash;"was it her husband or her
  young man who was killed?"</p>

  <p>"Her young man was killed," said Mason without hesitation. "You knew
  them?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You knew the husband, at any rate?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen photographs of him in her room. They were taken in
  Australia&mdash;her and the two. When I say I've seen them," she corrected
  herself, "I was just going to take a look at 'em when she come in the room
  and snatched the frame out of my hand&mdash;which was funny, because it had
  always been on the mantelshelf before, but I never took any notice of it till
  she said one day it was her husband and a great friend. It was on the
  following day I took up the picture to have a look."</p>

  <p>"And she snatched it out of your hand? How long ago was this?"</p>

  <p>She thought.</p>

  <p>"Two years last July."</p>

  <p>Mason nodded.</p>

  <p>"And soon after that she came into money, almost immediately after?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Albert was not surprised at his perspicuity. She had the impression
  that she had given him that information.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, she left me the next day, or two days after. I haven't spoken
  to her since. She lives in the grand part of Tidal Basin now. I always say
  that when people are well off&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I'm perfectly sure I can guess what you always say." He was not unkind
  but he was very firm. "Now, what sort of a frame would this be in
  &mdash;leather?"</p>

  <p>Yes, she thought rather that it was leather&mdash;or wood, covered with
  leather.</p>

  <p>"I know she put it in her box because I saw her do it&mdash;a little black
  box she used to keep under her bed."</p>

  <p>He questioned her and cross-checked her answers, eliminating in the
  process all possibility that her narrative might be embroidered by
  imagination. Into the lives of the poor comes no other romance than that of
  their own creation.</p>

  <p>He grew suddenly vague; she could not understand the questions he put to
  her. They seemed to have no foundation in reason. And then suddenly he
  touched a high note of romance. Had she ever seen a man with a piece of white
  cloth on his face? She shuddered pleasurably.</p>

  <p>"The Devil... I've heard of him, but never seen him, thank God! It was him
  that done it&mdash;everybody was saying so in the crowd." "Have you ever seen
  him?" She shook her head vigorously.</p>

  <p>"No, an' I don't want to in my state. But I know people who have... in the
  middle of the night."</p>

  <p>"When they've been dreaming," suggested Mason, but she would not have
  this.</p>

  <p>The Devil was a possession of Tidal Basin; not willingly would she
  surrender the legend. When he showed into the charge-room a woman made
  tearfully grateful by the knowledge that she could go to her home and her
  three children. Marford was waiting to say good night. Dr. Rudd had already
  left.</p>

  <p>"If you want me to-night, I shall be at my surgery. I hope I may be
  allowed to sleep."</p>

  <p>Mason had three things he wished to do at the same time&mdash;three
  errands on which he could trust nobody but himself. He decided to perform his
  first task single-handed and call back for Elk to assist him with the
  second.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MICHAEL QUIGLEY was coming up the steps of the police
  station as Mason appeared in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Carrion," said Mason pleasantly, "the body has been removed."</p>

  <p>"Who is it, Mason?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mason shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There was once," he said jovially, "a medical student who was asked how
  many teeth Adam was born with, and he replied, very properly, 'God
  knows.'"</p>

  <p>"Unknown, eh? A swell, they tell me?"</p>

  <p>"He's well dressed," said Mason in his noncommittal way. "Go along and
  have a look at him. You know all the toughs in the West End."</p>

  <p>Michael shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That can wait. What is this murder&mdash;a little joke of White
  Face?"</p>

  <p>"Why White Face?" demanded Mason. "Listen, Quigley, you've got a bug in
  your brain. White Face doesn't belong to Tidal Basin any more than your
  devil."</p>

  <p>"He's been seen here," insisted the reporter, and Mason sighed.</p>

  <p>"A man who wore a lump of lint over his face has been seen here. Dr.
  Marford, in a weak-minded moment, told you. You'd see the same in the
  neighbourhood of any hospital."</p>

  <p>Michael Quigley was unusually silent.</p>

  <p>"Oh... where are you going?"</p>

  <p>No other reporter dared ask such a question, but Mason knew this young man
  rather well.</p>

  <p>"You'll get me hung, Michael, but I'll let you come along with me. I'm
  going to see a green door and have a little independent search. Your
  encouragement and help will be welcome. How is Miss Harman?"</p>

  <p>Mike almost showed his teeth.</p>

  <p>"You can collect gossip, even if you can't collect murderers!" he snarled.
  "Miss Harman is a very good friend of mine who is going to marry somebody
  else."</p>

  <p>"I congratulate her," said Mason as they stepped out towards Endley
  Street. "It must be a terribly un-romantic life being married to a
  reporter."</p>

  <p>"There is no question of my being married to anybody," said Michael
  savagely, "and you're getting under my skin, Mason."</p>

  <p>"Fine," said Mason. "Some day I'll go shooting elephants."</p>

  <p>They trudged side by side, cold anger in the heart of one and an idea that
  was growing into shape in the mind of Mr. Mason. He whistled softly as he
  walked under the high wall of the Eastern Trading Company.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind," asked Michael with sour politeness, "choosing some other
  tune than the Wedding March?"</p>

  <p>"Was I whistling that?" asked the other in surprise. "Ever noticed how
  like a funeral march it is? Change the time and you're there."</p>

  <p>It was a beast of a night; a wind had risen, with the cold of the Eastern
  steppes.</p>

  <p>"Policemen and reporters," said Mason, "get their living out of other
  people's misfortunes. Has that ever struck you? Here they are!"</p>

  <p>The "they" were three men walking abreast towards them. They slackened
  their pace when Mason came into view and halted to receive them.</p>

  <p>"We've found nothing and nobody," said the senior. "We searched the yard,
  but there wasn't a sign of a man, though there were plenty of places where he
  could have hidden."</p>

  <p>"And the wicket gate?"</p>

  <p>"That was ajar," replied the detective. "Albert, the night watchman, swore
  that it hadn't been opened. It's against the rules to open the wicket gate
  unless there's a fire."</p>

  <p>"Maybe there was a fire," suggested Mason. "It's a good night for a fire.
  All right, you can come along with me."</p>

  <p>They had only a few yards to go before they came to the place where the
  pavement, the private yard road and the railway arch formed a triangle.</p>

  <p>"This is where the body was found." suggested Michael, and Mason indicated
  the spot.</p>

  <p>He was still whistling when he walked to the green-painted wicket door and
  pushed. It was locked now. If he'd only thought of trying that door&mdash;but
  if there had been a man behind it he would have had the sense to have shot in
  the bolts. He must have been hiding in there when Elk was searching the yard
  for the pocket case and watch. But if Mrs. Albert had talked&mdash;</p>

  <p>He confided his woes to Michael, a safe and sure recipient, for Michael
  Quigley knew just what not to print.</p>

  <p>"You get that sort of thing in all these cases," said Michael
  philosophically. "And you expect it, anyway. Nobody tells the truth, because
  there's some twiddling little thing to hide that may bring discredit upon
  them. Personally, I can't understand their mentality."</p>

  <p>His eyes roved over the pavement.</p>

  <p>"You searched the gutter, I suppose? There's a distinct slope to this
  sidewalk."</p>

  <p>Mason looked inquiringly at one of the detectives, but nobody could tell
  him anything except that the traps where storm water runs had been emptied
  and the mud at the bottom carefully searched, without anything of value being
  found.</p>

  <p>Michael straddled the gutter, and, pulling up his sleeve, ran his fingers
  through the slowly moving water, groping...</p>

  <p>"First shot!" he cried exultantly. "What's this?"</p>

  <p>Mason took it in his hand. It looked like a button or a tiny brown
  electric light bulb. One of the detectives put his light upon the find as it
  lay in Mason's hand.</p>

  <p>"It looks to me like a capsule," said Michael, turning it over
  curiously.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a tiny capsule of thin glass, containing something the
  colour of which was indistinguishable.</p>

  <p>"I seem to know the shape, too. Now where the devil have I seen those
  before?"</p>

  <p>"It can go to the police analyst, anyway," said Mason, and put it
  carefully in his pocket. "Mike, you're lucky: try again."</p>

  <p>Michael's wet hand went through the water, but he could find nothing. And
  then he saw what hundreds of pairs of eyes, focused on that strip of
  pavement, had not seen. It lay poised upon the sharp edge of the kerb, as if
  it had been carefully placed there, though it must have rolled and fallen
  into its position through no other agent than the force of gravity. The long
  stone hung over the kerb: the platinum circle was so dulled with rain that it
  was indistinguishable from the granite on which it rested.</p>

  <p>He picked it up, his heart thumping painfully.</p>

  <p>"What is this?"</p>

  <p>Mason took it from his unwilling hand.</p>

  <p>"A ring! To think those poor, blind bats&mdash;a ruby ring! I suppose the
  ruby's an imitation, but it looks ruby."</p>

  <p>Michael Quigley said nothing. The men were swaying blurs of shadow; he
  found a difficulty in breathing. Something in his attitude must have
  attracted Mason's attention, for he looked at him sharply.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you? God Almighty, you look like a dead man! It
  was stooping down that did it&mdash;the blood rushing to your head, eh?"</p>

  <p>Michael knew Mason well enough to realise that Superintendent Mason was
  advancing an excuse for the benefit of the other detectives, and this was
  confirmed when he sent them left and right groping vainly through the gutters
  for some new clue. Then it was, he took Michael's arm.</p>

  <p>"Son," he said kindly, "You've seen that ring before, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>Michael shook his head.</p>

  <p>"What's the use of telling me a lie?" Mason's voice was reproachful and
  hurt.</p>

  <p>"I don't remember seeing it before," said Michael harshly. It did not
  sound like his voice speaking.</p>

  <p>"Hiding up?" said Mason gently. "What's the use? Somebody's bound to come
  along and blow it all. You were saying only a minute ago how silly it was to
  keep things from the police&mdash;twiddling little things that don't count.
  And you couldn't understand their mentality. Are you understanding their
  mentality any better?"</p>

  <p>"I've never seen that ring before."</p>

  <p>It required a mighty effort on his part for Michael to make this
  statement. Mr. Mason was by nature a sceptic and not easily convinced.</p>

  <p>"You've seen it before and you know whom it belongs to. Listen, Michael!
  I'm not going to be sympathetic with you and I'm not going to try any of the
  monkey tricks that I use with half-witted criminals. You'll save yourself a
  lot of trouble and somebody else more, if you take me into your confidence.
  It doesn't mean that the person who owns that ring is going to be pinched, or
  that they're booked for pads of publicity&mdash;you know me too well for
  that. Hiding up, as you say, is one of the curses of the business."</p>

  <p>Michael had recovered himself by now.</p>

  <p>"You'll be pinching me for the murder in a minute," he said lightly. "No,
  I don't know that stone at all. I was a little dizzy from trying to do stunts
  in the gutter with my head between my legs. Try it yourself and see what
  effect it has on you."</p>

  <p>Mason looked at him for a long time, then at the ring.</p>

  <p>"A lady's ring, I should say." He tried it on his little finger. "And a
  little finger ring. It doesn't go any farther than the top of mine. That will
  mean publicity," he said carelessly. "I don't want to say anything against
  you newspaper men, Michael, but you certainly spread yourselves on a
  mysterious clue like this, and I shouldn't be surprised to find a portrait of
  the young lady&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Not Miss Harman?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Michael loudly.</p>

  <p>"Liar," retorted Mr. Mason. "It's Miss Harman's ring! And you knew it the
  moment you saw it!"</p>

  <p>He looked at the jewel for a while, then put it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"This man who was murdered was a South African?" asked Mike.</p>

  <p>Mason nodded.</p>

  <p>"Had he come recently from South Africa?"</p>

  <p>"We don't know, but we guess within the last week or two."</p>

  <p>"What is his name?"</p>

  <p>"We don't even know that, except that it's Donald."</p>

  <p>His jaw dropped; his large protruding eyes opened to their widest
  extent.</p>

  <p>"Whom is Miss Harman going to marry?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"An Irishman named Feeney," said Michael mendaciously. "No, as a matter of
  fact, Mason, she's marrying me. But I've had a little tiff with her. Can I
  see the body?"</p>

  <p>"Let's go together and make an evening of it," said Mason, and linked arms
  with him.</p>

  <p>Their gruesome errand lasted only a few minutes and left Michael more
  puzzled than ever. Puzzled and terribly distressed. There was no question at
  all that the man who had dropped that ring, whether it was the dead man or
  the murderer, was the romantic lover. He must find out the truth at all
  costs.</p>

  <p>He left Mason at the police station and ran out, almost knocking down a
  girl who was hesitating at the foot of the station steps.</p>

  <p>"Michael... Michael!" she gasped, and clutched him by the arm. "They told
  me you were here. I had to see you... Oh, Michael, I've been a fool and I do
  want help terribly badly!"</p>

  <p>He looked at her with momentary suspicion.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been here, Janice?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I've just arrived. There's my car." She pointed to its dim lights. The
  shoulders of her skin coat were wet with rain. "Could we go anywhere? I want
  to speak to you. There's been a murder, hasn't there?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"How dreadful! But I'm glad I knew where I could find you. There always
  seem to be murders here," she shuddered. "And I've been murdered, too,
  Michael. All my vanity, all my pride&mdash;if it's true. And I feel that you
  are the only person that can bring them to life again. Where can we go?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated. He had supplied the needs of the last edition; there was
  nothing more for him to write tonight, though his work was by no means done.
  He went back to the car. She was in so pitiable a condition that he took the
  wheel from her hand and drove her to Bury Street. He had never been in her
  flat before, so that he was a stranger to the maid who opened the door.</p>

  <p>Janice led the way to the pretty little drawing-room and closed the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Take your coat off," he commanded before she started speaking. "Your
  shoes and your stockings are all wet&mdash;go and change them."</p>

  <p>She went meekly, and returned in a few minutes with a dressing-gown
  wrapped round her, and cowered down in a low arm-chair before an electric
  radiator.</p>

  <p>"Here's the cablegram I had."</p>

  <p>She handed him a folded paper without looking up.</p>

  <p>"Wait! Before you read it I want to tell you. He said he had a farm in
  Paarl and he was very anxious to buy an adjoining property... and I was
  buying it for him and cabled out to Van Zyl, that awfully nice boy I spoke to
  you about, and told him to buy it. That is his answer."</p>

  <p>He opened the telegram. It was a long message.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">"THE PROPERTY YOU MENTION IS NOT AT PAARL BUT IN
  CONSTANTIA ADJOINING THE CONVICT PRISON. IT IS NOT AND NEVER HAS BEEN FOR
  SALE. DONALD BATEMAN, WHOM YOU MENTION AS PROPRIETOR, IS UNKNOWN AS LANDOWNER
  EITHER HERE OR IN RHODESIA. MY FRIEND PUBLIC PROSECUTOR IS AFRAID MAN YOU
  MENTION IS DONALD BATEMAN, WHO SERVED NINE MONTHS IMPRISONMENT AT CONSTANTIA
  FOR LAND FRAUDS; TALL, RATHER GOOD-LOOKING MAN, LONG SCAR UNDER HIS CHIN,
  GREY EYES. HE LEFT BY "BALMORAL CASTLE" FIVE WEEKS AGO EN ROUTE ENGLAND. HIS
  FRAUDS TAKE SHAPE OF PERSUADING PEOPLE ADVANCE MONEY BUY PROPERTY AND
  DECAMPING WITH DEPOSIT. PLEASE FORGIVE IF THIS LITTLE MELODRAMATIC. ALWAYS
  ANXIOUS TO SERVE. CARL."</p><br>

  <p>He folded the telegram aim looked at her oddly.</p>

  <p>And then he said in a strange voice:</p>

  <p>"The scar under the chin. It's curious, that's the first thing I
  noticed."</p>

  <p>She turned and looked up at him, startled.</p>

  <p>"You haven't seen him? You told me you hadn't. When did you see him?"</p>

  <p>Michael licked his dry lips. Donald Bateman! So that was his name! He
  walked across to her and laid his hand gently on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"My dear, how perfectly rotten for you!" he said huskily. "Isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Do you think that is true? That he is&mdash;what Carl says he is?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said. "You gave him the ring, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>She made an impatient little gesture.</p>

  <p>"That was nothing; it had no value except a sentimental one&mdash;which
  made it rather appropriate," she added bitterly.</p>

  <p>There was something he had to ask, something so difficult that he could
  hardly frame the words.</p>

  <p>"There are no complications, are there?"</p>

  <p>She looked up at him wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"Complications? What do you mean, Michael?"</p>

  <p>She saw that he avoided her gaze.</p>

  <p>"Well, I mean, you aren't married already secretly married, you know? It
  can be done three days."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Why should I? Of course not."</p>

  <p>He fetched a long sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Thank the Lord for that!" he said. "Are you fond of him? Not too fond,
  are you, Janice?"</p>

  <p>"No. I've been a mad schoolgirl, haven't I? I've been realising it all the
  evening, that I didn't&mdash;love him. I wonder if you'll believe it... I
  haven't even kissed him-ugh!"</p>

  <p>He patted her shoulder gently.</p>

  <p>"Naturally my pride is hurt, but I haven't crashed so utterly as I should
  if I&mdash;well, if this thing had gone on before I found it out. You'll
  never laugh at me, will you, Michael?"</p>

  <p>She put up her hand and laid it on that which rested on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"No, I shan't laugh at you."</p>

  <p>She sat gazing into the glowing electric fire, and then:</p>

  <p>"Why did you ask about the ring?"</p>

  <p>He made the plunge.</p>

  <p>"Because I've been lying about it to Mason&mdash;Superintendent Mason of
  Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>She was up on her feet instantly, here eyes wide with alarm.</p>

  <p>"Scotland Yard! Have they got the ring? Have they arrested him? Michael,
  what is it?" She gripped his arm. "You're hiding something &mdash;what is
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I've been hiding something&mdash;yes. I've been hiding from Mason the
  fact that the ring was yours. It was in Endley Street. I picked it up myself,
  near the place where the body of a murdered man was found."</p>

  <p>"A murdered man was found in Endley Street." She repeated the words
  slowly. "That was the case you were on... Who was it? Not Donald
  Bateman?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"O God, how awful!"</p>

  <p>He thought she was going to faint, but when he reached out to catch her
  she pushed him back.</p>

  <p>"He was stabbed by some person unknown," said Michael. "I&mdash;I've seen
  him. That's how I knew about the scar."</p>

  <p>She was very still and white but she showed no other signs of
  distress.</p>

  <p>"What was he doing there?" she asked. "He didn't know the neighbourhood;
  he told me to-day he'd never been there before in his life. Nobody knows who
  did it?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Nobody. When I saw the ring I recognised it at once. Like a fool I gave
  myself away, and Mason, who's as sharp as a packet of needles, knew I was
  lying when I told him I had never seen it before. He may advertise the ring
  to-morrow unless I tell him."</p>

  <p>"Then tell him," she said instantly. "Dead! It's unbelievable!"</p>

  <p>She sat down in the chair again, her face in her hands. He thought she was
  on the verge of a breakdown, but when she raised her face to him her eyes
  were tearless.</p>

  <p>"You had better go back, my dear. I shan't do anything stupid &mdash;but
  I'm afraid I shan't sleep. Will you come early in the morning and let me know
  what has been discovered? I intended going to see Dr. Marford to-morrow to
  ask him to let me come back to the clinic, but I don't think I can for a day
  or two."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to leave you like this," he said, but she smiled
  faintly.</p>

  <p>"You're talking as if I were a mid-Victorian heroine," she said. "No, my
  dear, you go. I'd like to be alone for a little while."</p>

  <p>And then, to his great embarrassment, she raised his hand and kissed
  it.</p>

  <p>"I'm being motherly," she said.</p>

  <p>If there were no tears in her eyes, pain was there. He thought it wise of
  him to leave at once, and he went back to Tidal Basin to find the streets
  alive with police, for two important things had happened; two new phases of
  the drama had been enacted in his absence.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A FRAMED photograph is not a difficult object to find, and
  black boxes in which ladies keep their treasures deposited beneath their beds
  are far from becoming rarities. Mason would have liked to have Elk with him,
  but the sergeant had gone on to join Bray. A watch was being kept on the
  block in which Louis Landor's apartments were situated. Bray had telephoned
  through that neither Mr. nor Mrs. Landor was yet at home. Evidently something
  was wrong here, for the servant, who had returned and was awaiting admission,
  told Bray that she had been sent out earlier in the day, that there had been
  some sort of trouble between a couple that were hitherto happily married. She
  had been told she need not return until late. Bray had found her waiting
  disconsolately outside the flat, and had persuaded her to spend the night
  with a sister who lived in the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>"One thing she told me," said Bray over the wire; "the flat is packed with
  South African curios. If this girl's story is true, there are two knives
  similar to the one with which the murder was committed&mdash;they hang on a
  belt in the hall. She described the sheath exactly, and said they both had
  the initials of Landor, and that he got them as prizes in South America,
  where he lived for some years."</p>

  <p>"Hang on," were Mason's instructions. "Elk's gone up to join you. Report
  to me here or at Scotland Yard. I am making a search on my own."</p>

  <p>He had on his desk the contents of Mrs. Weston's bag, including the worn
  hypodermic case that Dr. Marford had produced. The case puzzled him, because
  it was old and the little syringe had evidently been used many times. And yet
  Marford had given it as his opinion that the woman was not an addict and that
  it was only the second time that the needle had been used.</p>

  <p>There were a few letters, a bill or two from a West End milliner.
  Evidently Lorna Weston, in spite of the poverty-stricken neighbourhood in
  which she lived, spared no expense in the adornment of her person. He found
  two five-pound notes, half a dozen Treasury bills, a little silver and a
  bunch of keys, and it was with these keys that, in company with Sergeant
  Shale, he made his way to the mystery woman's apartments.</p>

  <p>What Mrs. Albert had described as "the grand part of Tidal Basin,"
  consisted of two or three streets of well-built villas. There were several
  shops here, and it was over one of these, a large grocery store, that Mrs.
  Weston had her apartments, which were approached by a side door and a short
  passage. From this ran a flight of rather steep steps to a landing above.</p>

  <p>The place was fitted with electric light and had, he saw, a telephone of
  its own. He climbed the stairs and was staggered to find that the landing had
  been painted and decorated in the West End style. Parchment-covered walls,
  white metal wall-brackets and soft-shaded lamps gave the approach to the
  apartment the appearance of luxury.</p>

  <p>The front room was the parlour, and was tastefully furnished, and this was
  the case with the other rooms, including an expensively fitted
  kitchenette.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mason was essentially a man of the world. He knew that this style of
  living was consistent with the earnings of no profession, reputable or
  otherwise. Either Mrs. Weston had a private income of her own or
  else&mdash;</p>

  <p>He remembered that the woman at the police station had spoken of her
  coming into a lot of money. That might be an explanation. But why did she
  choose this ghastly neighbourhood in which to live?</p>

  <p>There was a small writing-table in the drawing-room, but a search of
  this&mdash;the drawers were unlocked&mdash;revealed nothing that was in any
  way satisfactory to the searcher. It was in the bedroom that he and his
  assistant decided to make their most careful scrutiny. This was the room next
  to the drawing-room and the last to be visited. As soon as he switched on the
  lights, Mason realised that something unusual had happened. The drawers of
  the dressing-table had been pulled out, the plate-glass door of the wardrobe
  stood wide open. On the floor was a medley of garments and wearing apparel,
  and amidst them Mason saw the corner of a black box. He went quickly to this.
  It had been locked, but somebody had broken open the lid. Scattered about the
  floor were oddments and papers. There was no framed photograph. What he did
  see was a small cardboard cylinder. He picked it up and squinted through it;
  it was empty.</p>

  <p>The cylinder interested him, because he knew it was the kind in which
  marriage certificates were kept; and however unhappy a marriage might be,
  that little slip of paper is one with which no woman parts willingly.</p>

  <p>"Get the men in and we'll dust the place for fingerprints," he said.</p>

  <p>He had hardly spoken the words before he saw lying on the bed a pair of
  white cotton gloves. The intruder had taken no risks. He examined them
  carefully, but they told him nothing except that they were white cotton
  gloves which had been carefully washed, probably by their user.</p>

  <p>When had the burglar come, and how had he secured admission? The door
  below had not been forced; only the black box, which, he guessed, had been in
  the bottom drawer of the bureau when it was found, for nothing in this drawer
  had been disturbed, and there was a space which such a box might have
  occupied.</p>

  <p>Of clues by which he could judge the time, there was none.</p>

  <p>"There's somebody knocking on the door down below," said Shale. "Shall I
  see who it is?"</p>

  <p>"No, wait; I'll go."</p>

  <p>Mason went quickly down the stairs and opened the door. A woman was
  standing there with a shawl over her head to protect her from the rain. She
  looked dubiously at Mason standing in the light, and edged farther back. It
  struck him that she was ready to run.</p>

  <p>"Is everything all right?" she asked nervously.</p>

  <p>"Everything is all wrong," said Mason. And then, recognising her timidity
  and guessing the reason: "Don't worry&mdash;I'm a police officer."</p>

  <p>He saw she was relieved.</p>

  <p>"I'm the caretaker of the house opposite; the lady is away in the country;
  and I was wondering whether I ought to go to the police or not."</p>

  <p>"Then you saw somebody go into this flat to-night?" asked Mason
  quickly.</p>

  <p>"I saw them come out," she said. "I wouldn't even have taken notice of
  that if it hadn't been for the white thing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What white thing? You mean, it was somebody with a white mask?" Mason
  snapped the question at her.</p>

  <p>"I won't swear to who it was, but I will swear that he had white on his
  face. I saw it as plain as can be in the light of the street lamp. I've had
  toothache all night and I've been sitting in our front parlour&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He cut short her narrative.</p>

  <p>"When did you see this somebody come out?" he asked.</p>

  <p>It was less than a quarter of an hour ago. She had also seen him and Shale
  enter and, believing that they were police officers, she had ventured to come
  over and knock at the door. He questioned her closely as to how the burglar
  had been dressed, and the description was a familiar one: the long coat that
  reached to the heels, the black felt hat and the white mask. He learned one
  characteristic which had never before been noticed: the man limped painfully.
  She was very sure of this. He came in no car and went away walking, and had
  disappeared round the corner of the block, in the direction opposite to that
  which the two detectives had followed on their way to the flat.</p>

  <p>Shale came down and took a shorthand note of her statement, and then the
  two men returned to the flat and made an even more careful scrutiny in the
  hope that White Face might have left something else behind than his
  gloves.</p>

  <p>"I don't even know that these won't tell us something."</p>

  <p>Mason put the gloves carefully into a paper bag and slipped them into his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"Then it's true, White Face is an institution here."</p>

  <p>"They all think so," said Shalee. "The little thieves round here glorify
  him!"</p>

  <p>Mason returned to the station, a very much baffled man. He had two pieces
  of evidence, and these he had locked away in the station safe. He took out
  the ring and the capsule and brought them into the inspector's room. The
  garrulous Rudd would be able to tell him something about this. He opened the
  door and called to the station sergeant.</p>

  <p>"I suppose Dr. Rudd will be in bed by now?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; he rang me up a quarter of an hour ago. He said he was coming
  round to offer rather a startling theory. Those were his words &mdash;'rather
  a startling theory.'"</p>

  <p>Mason groaned.</p>

  <p>"It'll be startling all right! Get him on the 'phone and ask him if he'll
  step round. Don't mention the theory. I want him to identify a medicine."</p>

  <p>He examined the ring through a magnifying-glass, but there was nothing
  that could tell him a twentieth of what Michael Quigley could have told.</p>

  <p>"That Quigley knows something," grumbled Mason. "I nearly had it out of
  him, too."</p>

  <p>"What could he know, sir?" asked Shale.</p>

  <p>"He knows who owns that ring," nodded Mason. The station sergeant opened
  the door and looked in. "Dr. Rudd went out five minutes ago on his way, sir,"
  he said, "and there's a message for you from the Yard."</p>

  <p>It was from the Information Bureau. The mysterious Donald had been
  located.</p>

  <p>"His name is Donald Bateman," said the reporting detective. "He arrived
  from South Africa three weeks ago and is staying at the Little Norfolk Hotel,
  Norfolk Street, The description tallies with the description you sent us, Mr.
  Mason."</p>

  <p>"He's not in the hotel now by any chance?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, he went out this evening, wearing a dinner jacket, and said he
  wouldn't be back till midnight. He hasn't been seen since. He has a scar
  under his chin&mdash;that corresponds with your description, too &mdash;and
  he's about the same height as the murdered man."</p>

  <p>"Pass his name to the Identification Bureau," said Mason, "see if we have
  any record of him and&mdash;don't go away, my lad&mdash;post a man in the
  hotel. If Mr. Donald Bateman doesn't return by seven o'clock tomorrow morning
  have his trunks removed to Cannon Row Police Station and held until I come
  and search them,"</p>

  <p>He hung up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Donald Bateman, eh? That's something to go on, Mr. Bray hasn't rung
  up?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>Mason strolled back to the inspector's room and resumed his examination of
  the ring and the capsule.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Michael knows all about the ring or I'm a Dutchman. The young devil
  nearly fainted when he found it."</p>

  <p>"Where could the ring and the capsule have come from?" asked Shale.</p>

  <p>"Where else could they have come from than out of Donald Bateman's pocket?
  You've heard all the witnesses examined: they agree that when Bateman fell he
  put his hand in his waistcoat pocket and tried to get something out. He
  probably got both these things in his hand; they rolled down the sidewalk
  into the gutter, and they wouldn't have been found then but for Michael. I'll
  say that of the kid, he's got good instincts."</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"How far does the doctor live from here?"</p>

  <p>"Not four minutes' walk," said Shale, who had been sent to fetch the
  divisional surgeon when the murder was reported.</p>

  <p>"Then he ought to be here by now. Ring him again."</p>

  <p>But Dr. Rudd's housekeeper insisted that he had left ten minutes
  before.</p>

  <p>"Go out and see if you can find him."</p>

  <p>Mason was suddenly serious. He mistrusted the doctor's theories; he
  mistrusted more his garrulity. A man who talks all the time and whose topics
  are limited in number must inevitably say something which the police would
  rather he did not say. He hoped he had not met a friend on the way.</p>

  <p>In a little under ten minutes Shale came back. He had been as far as the
  doctor's house but had seen no sign of Rudd. It was a comparatively short and
  straightforward walk.</p>

  <p>"He may be with Dr. Marford. Ring him."</p>

  <p>But Marford could offer no explanation, except that he had been in his
  surgery and that Rudd had passed, tapping on the big surgery window to say
  good night.</p>

  <p>"And frightened me out of my skin," complained Dr. Marford. "I hadn't the
  slightest idea who it was until I went up and looked behind the blinds."</p>

  <p>The distance from the doctor's surgery to the police station was less than
  two hundred yards, but there was another way, through Gallows Alley, an
  unwholesome short cut, by which the distance could be cut off some fifty
  yards. As nobody ever went into Gallows Alley, except those lost souls who
  dragged out their dreary existence there, it was presumable that Rudd had
  taken the longest route.</p>

  <p>The lower end of Gallows Alley ran out through a tunnel-shaped opening
  flush with and a few yards north of Dr. Marford's side door. In the days when
  drunken sailormen from the docks and wharves were as common as lamp-posts,
  Gallows Alley was a place of picturesque infamy. It was no longer
  picturesque.</p>

  <p>A Chinaman had a tiny lodging-house there in which he housed an incredible
  number of his fellow countrymen. Four or five Italian families lived in
  another house, and other families less easy to describe dwelt in the others.
  It was said that the police went down Gallows Alley in pairs. That is not
  true. They never went at all, and only with the greatest circumspection when
  bona fide cries of "Murder!" called for their attention.</p>

  <p>Dr. Marford was one of the few people who went down that lane day or night
  voluntarily and suffered no harm. Did he wish, he could tell hair-raising
  stories of what he had seen and heard in that malodorous thoroughfare, but he
  was from choice a poor raconteur.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think Rudd would go down there," he said in answer to the
  superintendent's inquiry. "At any rate, if you have any doubt I'll go
  myself."</p>

  <p>Half an hour passed, and at a quarter to two Mason gathered all his
  reserves and sent them on a search. A telephone call brought swift police
  launches to the water front, to the distress of the local gang that was
  illicitly breaking cargo when the boats arrived. But there was no sign of
  Rudd or message from him. Momentarily he had vanished from the face of the
  earth.</p>

  <p>This was the situation as Michael Quigley found it when he arrived on the
  scene. He sought an interview with the superintendent and told him frankly,
  as Janice had directed him to tell, the story of the ring. Mr. Mason listened
  wearily.</p>

  <p>"Hiding up!" he wailed. "What good did it do? Why couldn't you tell me
  right away&mdash;not that it would have made any difference, except that I
  should have known the name earlier. Yes, that's his name, Donald Bateman.
  We're getting warmer&mdash;hallo, Doctor!"</p>

  <p>It was Marford, who had come for news of his colleague.</p>

  <p>"None. He's probably discovered that the murderer was an Irishman and he's
  gone off by the night boat to Ireland to get local colour. Sit down, Doctor,
  and have some coffee."</p>

  <p>He pushed a steaming cup towards Marford, who took it and sipped
  painfully.</p>

  <p>"Where he's gone I don't know, and don't care." Mason yawned. "I'm a weary
  man, and I did hope this murder was coming out nicely. If Mr. Louis Landor
  would only come home like a good lad, we ought to have all the threads in our
  hands by the morning. But if Mr. Louis Landor has taken his passport and his
  three thousand pounds in a private aeroplane to the Continent, then this is
  going to be one of those well-known unravelled mysteries of London that
  reporters write about when they're too old for ordinary work."</p>

  <p>The doctor finished his coffee and went soon after. His second case was
  due.</p>

  <p>Mason walked with him to the door.</p>

  <p>"Any more theories?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've got, not a theory, but an absolute conviction now." said
  Marford quietly. "But for the trifling detail that I'm not in a position to
  supply the evidence, I think I could tell you the murderer."</p>

  <p>Mason nodded.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you are thinking of the same person, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>Marford smiled.</p>

  <p>"For his sake, I hope not."</p>

  <p>"Which means that you're not going to give us the benefit of your logic
  and deductions?"</p>

  <p>"I'm a doctor, not a detective," said the other.</p>

  <p>Mason came back to the charge-room fire and warmed his hands.</p>

  <p>"No message from Bray or Elk?"</p>

  <p>He glanced at the clock; it was a quarter-past two. He began to have his
  doubts whether Mr. Louis Landor would ever return to his flat.</p>

  <p>Accompanied by the reporter, he strolled out in the direction of Gallows
  Alley. The rain had ceased, but the wind still blew fitfully.</p>

  <p>"And if you're writing about this place," he said, "don't fall into an
  error common to all cub reporters that Gallows Alley stands on the site of
  Execution Dock. It doesn't. It was named after a man called Gallers, who owns
  a lot of property about here, and if, instead of putting up his silly
  clinics, the doctor would get his rich pals to buy this area and clear away
  the slums, he'd be doing the world a service&mdash;and the police."</p>

  <p>The entry of Gallows Alley looked dark and formidable. Within a few yards
  were the gates of the doctor's yard. It was a small courtyard, at one end of
  which was a shed, which he hired out to the famous Gregory Wicks, a veteran
  owner of a taxicab. It was in another way a most useful assembling place for
  the doctor, who dispensed his own medicines. Almost any evening could be seen
  a queue of poorly-dressed men and women lined up, waiting their turn to enter
  the narrow passage that flanked the surgery and receive through a small hatch
  from the doctor's hands the medicine he had ordered and dispensed.</p>

  <p>It's more like the waiting-room of a hospital than a private surgery,"
  explained Michael. Mason grunted.</p>

  <p>"Why keep 'em alive?" he asked in despair. A wall divided Gallows Alley
  from the doctor's yard, the houses in that by-pass being built on one side of
  the court only.</p>

  <p>Mason looked up and down, and again felt that unaccountable sensation of
  menace.</p>

  <p>The road was a black canyon, and the starry arc lamps emphasised the
  desolation. A street of tombs; black, ugly, shoddy tombs, nailed and glued
  and cheaply cemented together. The dingy window-glass hardly returned the
  reflection of the lights; no chimney smoked, no window glowed humanly. Up
  Gallows Alley, where the door panels had been used for firewood, men and
  women slept in the open, huddled up in the deep recesses of doorways, slept
  through the rain and the soughing wind, old sacks drawn over their knees and
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>As Mason and his companion picked a way over the slippery cobbles, a voice
  in the darkness chanted&mdash;the voice of a woman husky with sleep:</p>

  <p>"I spy a copper with a shinin' collar. If he touches me I'll holler
  &mdash;P'lice!"</p>

  <p>He never ceased to wonder how they could see in the dark.</p>

  <p>"They're rats," said Mike, answering his unspoken thought.</p>

  <p>A chuckle of sly laughter came to them.</p>

  <p>"They never sleep," said Mason in despair. "It was the same in my time.
  Day and night you could go through Gallows Alley and there would be somebody
  watching you."</p>

  <p>He wheeled suddenly and called a name. From a entry slunk a figure, which
  might have been man or woman.</p>

  <p>"Thought it was you," said Mason.</p>

  <p>(Who it was, or who he thought it was, Michael never learnt.)</p>

  <p>"How are things?"</p>

  <p>"Bad, Mr. Mason, very bad." It was the whining voice of an old man.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Dr. Rudd to-night?"</p>

  <p>Again came that eerie peal of laughter from invisible depths.</p>

  <p>"He's the coppers' man, ain't he&mdash;Rudd? No, Mr. Mason, 'we ain't seen
  him. Nobody comes down 'ere. Afraid of wakin' people up, they are!"</p>

  <p>The chuckles came now like the rustle of a wind.</p>

  <p>Mason stopped before No. 9. A man was sitting on the step, his back to the
  door, a bibulous man who slept noisily. An old hearth-rug was drawn over his
  knees and on top some belated wag of Gallows Alley had balanced an empty
  tomato can.</p>

  <p>"If it doesn't fall and wake him, old man Wicks will give him a shock if
  he finds him there!" said Mason.</p>

  <p>"Uncanny, isn't it?" he said when they had emerged from the court. "They
  talk about Chinamen in the East End of London. Lord! they're the only decent
  people they've got in Gallows Alley, and old Gregory."</p>

  <p>"I wonder what they do for a living?"</p>

  <p>"I should hate to know," said Mason.</p>

  <p>They came back by the way they had entered.</p>

  <p>"I'm giving Bray another hour, and then I'm going up to the Yard."</p>

  <p>"I'll drive you, if you like. There's nothing more to be got here."</p>

  <p>The shadowy figure they had seen emerged from the opening, holding an old
  overcoat about his throat.</p>

  <p>"White Face has been around to-night, they say, Mr. Mason."</p>

  <p>"Do they, indeed?" said Mason politely.</p>

  <p>"You don't treat us right, Mr. Mason. You come down 'ere an' expect us to
  'nose' for you, and everybody in the court knows we're 'nosing.' If you
  treated us right and did the proper thing, you'd hear something. What's the
  matter with old Gregory, hey? That's something you don't know &mdash;and
  nobody else knows. What's the matter with Gregory?"</p>

  <p>And with this cryptic remark he vanished.</p>

  <p>"He's mad&mdash;genuinely mad. No, I don't know his name, but he's mad in
  a sane way. What in hell does he mean about Gregory?"</p>

  <p>Mike could not answer. He knew old Gregory&mdash;everybody in London knew
  the man who housed his cab in Dr. Marford's yard and lived alone in the one
  decent house in Gallows Court.</p>

  <p>"I'd give a lot to know what that crazy man knew about him&mdash;what he
  was driving at."</p>

  <p>Mason was disturbed, irritable. A detective officer has an instinct for
  sincerity&mdash;it is two-thirds of his mental equipment, and the demented
  denizen of the court was not rambling. To speak ill, or hint suspicion,
  against Gregory Wicks was a kind of treason.</p>

  <p>"Rum lot of devils," he said, and shrugged off his uneasiness.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE telephone bell had been ringing at frequent intervals in
  the Landors' flat; the waiting detectives could hear it in the street: there
  must have been a half-open window somewhere through which the sound could
  come.</p>

  <p>"It's Mason getting rattled, I should think," said Elk fretfully. "Why I
  came here I don't know. Madness! I get like that sometimes&mdash;just go
  dippy and do silly things."</p>

  <p>"You came here," said Inspector Bray heavily, "because you were told to
  come by your superior officer."</p>

  <p>Elk groaned.</p>

  <p>"The trouble with you, Billy, is that you've no sense of unimportance," he
  said helplessly.</p>

  <p>"That doesn't sound very respectful," said Mr. Bray severely.</p>

  <p>He wanted to be very severe indeed, but you never knew with Elk. At any
  moment he might force you into bringing him before the Chief Constable, and
  invariably when he was brought before the Chief Constable he demonstrated
  that he and the Chief Constable were the only people in the world who took a
  sensible view of the circumstances. "How many men have you posted?" he asked.
  "I don't want to give either of these two people a chance of slipping
  us."</p>

  <p>"I've posted none," said Sergeant Elk, almost brightly. "My superior
  officer has posted three, and takes all the responsibility. I ventured to
  suggest a different posting, but I was told to mind my own so-and-so
  business."</p>

  <p>"I said nothing of the sort," said Bray hotly.</p>

  <p>"You meant it," was Elk's retort.</p>

  <p>Bray looked anxiously up and down. He was not terribly happy, working
  under Mason. Very few detective officers were. And he was out of his own
  division, which was all wrong. Moreover, Mason was very unforgiving when his
  subordinates fell into error, and this was a murder case, where no excuses
  would be accepted. On the whole, it was better to conciliate his sergeant,
  who was notoriously a favourite of the superintendent.</p>

  <p>He stared up and down the road uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"If I've been a little short-tempered with you, Elk, I'm sorry," he said
  almost affectionately. "I'm so distracted with this business. Where did you
  say I ought to post a man?"</p>

  <p>"In the back courtyard," said Elk promptly. "There's a reachable fire
  escape up which any healthy man or woman could climb, or vice versa."</p>

  <p>Elk was on the point of withdrawing a perfectly useless patrol at the far
  end of the street, when a taxicab turned the corner, stopped before the main
  door of the apartment and a woman got out. They were watching from the corner
  of a front garden on the opposite side of the road.</p>

  <p>"That looks like the lady, eh? What do you think, Elk?"</p>

  <p>"That's madam," said Elk. "And I've seen her before somewhere."</p>

  <p>She had paid the taxi and it drove slowly away. The watchers still
  waited.</p>

  <p>As Inez Landor put the key in the front door they saw her turn her head
  and look anxiously round. She could see nobody. Her imagination had pictured
  the road packed with police officers. She hurried up to the first floor,
  unlocked her own door and went into the flat.</p>

  <p>There was a small hand-lamp on the table, working from a dry battery, and
  it was this she switched on. There were four letters in the letter-box. She
  did not even trouble to take them out, but, taking the lamp in her hand, she
  went softly to the bedroom door, which opened from the hall, and looked in.
  Her heart sank when she saw that her husband had not returned. What should
  she do? What could she do? With a deep sigh, she took off her leather coat
  and hat and went into the bedroom, leaving the door open.</p>

  <p>There had been a murder in the East End; she had seen the late edition
  bills and heard somebody speaking about it at supper&mdash;not that she ate
  supper, but usually, when she and her husband were both out, she arranged to
  meet Louis at Elford's. He had not appeared. She had waited till the
  restaurant closed, and had then gone on to a fashionable all-night
  coffee-house, where they went when he was very late. He was not there either.
  The time of waiting seemed an eternity. In despair she had gone home, not
  daring to buy the midnight sheets which were being sold on the street for
  fear...</p>

  <p>She shivered. She wondered whether that nice doctor would say anything;
  the man with the gentle voice, who had been so sympathetic and who had given
  her sal volatile. How stupid she had been to mistake a fight between two
  labourers! Perhaps that was what the newspapers called murder.</p>

  <p>She had told him so much&mdash;things she would not have told to her
  mother if she were living. There was hardly a step she had taken that day
  which she did not now bitterly regret. It was worse than folly&mdash;sheer
  madness, to go in search of Louis. Suppose something had happened &mdash;a
  fight; she dared not imagine worse. She had broadcast his motives through
  London.</p>

  <p>Inez Landor drew on her dressing-gown and walked up and down the dark
  room, striving to settle her mind to calmness. She had had four deliriously
  happy years, years of dream-building. That flimsy fabric had been shivered to
  nothingness.</p>

  <p>She thought she heard a sound, a step in the hall, and, opening the door,
  she listened. There it was again, a faint creak. There was a loose board near
  the hall door. She had always intended having that board replaced.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Louis?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>There was no answer. She could hear the solemn ticking of the hall clock,
  and the far-away whirr of a motorcar passing the end of the road.</p>

  <p>"Louis&mdash;is that you?" she raised her voice.</p>

  <p>She must have been mistaken, then, for no answer came. She left the door
  ajar, and, going to the window, pulled aside the curtains carefully and
  looked out. A futile act, for this window looked upon the well at the back of
  the building.</p>

  <p>And then she heard a faint knock. The silence in the flat was so deep that
  it re-echoed through the hall. She tiptoed into the hall and listened. The
  knock was repeated, and she crept to the door.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" she asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Louis."</p>

  <p>Her heart was beating furiously. She turned the handle and admitted him,
  closing the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"Put on the light, darling."</p>

  <p>His voice was strained and old-sounding. It was the voice of a man who had
  been running and had not recovered his breath.</p>

  <p>"Sitting in the dark? Turn on the lights."</p>

  <p>"Wait!"</p>

  <p>There was a window in the tiny lobby which could be seen from the street.
  She pulled down the blind and drew the thick curtains across and closed her
  own door before she switched the light in the hall. Save for the blue bruise
  under one eye, his face was colourless. Inez Landor stared at her husband
  with growing terror.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. It was at once a gesture of impatience and
  weariness.</p>

  <p>"Nothing very much. I have had a ghastly time. Inez, will you get me a
  glass of water?"</p>

  <p>"Shall I get you some wine?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, darling, water."</p>

  <p>She was gone for a few minutes; when she returned he was looking at the
  knife and belt that hung on the wall. It was one of many souvenirs he had
  collected in his travels&mdash;a broad leather belt with big brass bosses,
  from which hung a knife in a gaily ornamented sheath. Before this day it had
  meant no more than the saddle, the lasso, the spears and the strange Aztec
  relics that covered the wall.</p>

  <p>"We've got to get rid of that somehow," he said.</p>

  <p>"The knife?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, this."</p>

  <p>He tapped the empty frog where a second knife had been.</p>

  <p>She did not ask him why; but what hope there was left in her heart,
  flickered and died. For a little while neither spoke. There were questions
  she wanted to ask him which her tongue refused to frame. She could only make
  the most trite and commonplace remarks.</p>

  <p>"I thought I heard you in the flat a few minutes ago," she said. "You
  haven't been in before?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Why did you knock?" she asked, suddenly remembering.</p>

  <p>He licked his lips.</p>

  <p>"I lost my key. I don't know where&mdash;somewhere."</p>

  <p>He drank the remainder of the water and put the glass on the top of a
  little desk which stood against the wall.</p>

  <p>"I could have sworn I heard the door close a few minutes ago," she said.
  "I came out and called you. I heard somebody walking in the hall."</p>

  <p>He smiled and his arm went round her shoulders. "Your nerve is going. Have
  you been waiting here in the dark?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. Should she tell him? It was not the moment for
  half-confidences.</p>

  <p>"No, I have been out looking for you."</p>

  <p>She caught his arm.</p>

  <p>"Louis, you didn't fight? You didn't&mdash;do anything?"</p>

  <p>Louis Landor did not answer immediately.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said. "Let us go into the sitting-room."</p>

  <p>But she pushed him back into the chair where he was sitting.</p>

  <p>"No, no, stay here. None of these lights shows from the street."</p>

  <p>He looked at her sharply.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;none of these lights shows from the street? Is
  anybody outside watching?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure," she said. "I think so. Before I left the restaurant I
  telephoned here in the hope that you had returned. I thought the maid was
  here, and didn't realise that she couldn't get in. I knew she'd gone to her
  sister's and I called her up. Louis"&mdash;her lips quivered &mdash;"the
  police have been here."</p>

  <p>And when he did not speak she knew&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Has anything happened?"</p>

  <p>Louis Landor ran his fingers through his long black hair.</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;yes&mdash;I do know, but I'm not sure how far I was
  involved. When I went out after him I lost sight of him, but I had an idea I
  should find him somewhere in the West End, and I was right."</p>

  <p>"You spoke to him?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, he was in a car with a girl&mdash;a pretty girl; some poor little
  fool who has fallen for him. She's a nurse who works for Marford."</p>

  <p>He saw her mouth open wide in amazement.</p>

  <p>"For Marford&mdash;not Dr. Marford?"</p>

  <p>"How the devil did you know that?" he asked, astonished. "Yes, he's got a
  clinic in the East End, I'm going to see her to-morrow and tell her the truth
  about Mr. Donald Bateman. I followed them in a cab to Bury Street and then
  back to his hotel. I wanted the chance of seeing him alone without making any
  kind of scandal, but he never gave me the chance. Naturally I did not want to
  send my name up to his room, so I waited till he came out. There wasn't the
  ghost of a chance of seeing him: he went to a little restaurant which was
  crowded with people, but I knew that if I was patient I should pick him up
  and settle our little matter definitely. He lingered over his dinner and I
  have an idea that he was waiting for somebody. She came
  eventually&mdash;rather a pretty woman. She wasn't in evening dress and her
  voice was rather common. When he went out of the restaurant I followed,
  keeping at a distance. I think he'd recognised me this afternoon. Naturally,
  she complicated matters: I had to wait till he dropped her. After dinner they
  drove away from the restaurant. I was in the gallery upstairs and could see
  everything that was happening. I took a taxi and followed them&mdash;they
  drove to a very poor neighbourhood &mdash;Tidal Basin, they call it, I think.
  There she went into a flat with him&mdash;it was over a shop. It was then
  that I telephoned to you. Darling, you didn't follow me?"</p>

  <p>She nodded dejectedly.</p>

  <p>"I had an uncomfortable feeling you might. You were mad!"</p>

  <p>"I know. Go on," she said. "What happened then?"</p>

  <p>He asked for another glass of water and she brought it for him.</p>

  <p>"He came out alone, and I followed him to a street which has a long wall
  on one side. I was just going up to him when I saw the woman run across the
  road. She spoke to him for a little time and then they parted. It was my
  opportunity. There was nobody in sight and I came up to him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He had the knife?" she interrupted, and he smiled wryly.</p>

  <p>"I gave him no chance to use it." She had seen the bruise on his face but
  had not the courage to ask him how he came by it. It seemed so unimportant in
  view of the other terrific possibility.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;Yes, I hit him. He went down like a log. I got scared. I saw
  somebody standing in the doorway&mdash;a doctor's place&mdash;it must have
  been Marford. I ran. And then I saw a policeman walking towards me. At the
  place where I stopped there was a big gate which had a wicket door. By some
  miracle it was unlocked. I got through and bolted the door. I was in a narrow
  yard which surrounded the warehouse. The police came and searched it but I
  hid behind some packing cases."</p>

  <p>"The police?" she gasped. "Searched it. Is Donald&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Not dead?" she wailed.</p>

  <p>He nodded again.</p>

  <p>"The police have been here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. They've been questioning the maid. I don't know what she has told
  them."</p>

  <p>He got up and walked to the little desk and felt in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I've lost my keys."</p>

  <p>She took a little leather case from her bag and handed it to him. He
  opened one of the drawers and took out a thick packet of papers.</p>

  <p>"I suppose very few people keep three thousand pounds in the entrance hall
  of their flat!" His voice was now almost normal. "Whatever happens, we'll get
  out of the country to-morrow. If anything goes wrong with me, you take the
  money and get away."</p>

  <p>She clutched at his sleeve frantically.</p>

  <p>"What can happen to you, Louis? You didn't kill him&mdash;the knife!"</p>

  <p>He disengaged her hand almost roughly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether I killed him. Now listen," he said. "You've got to
  be terribly sensible about this. Even if this blackguard told everything,
  they can't hurt you. But I don't want you to suffer the ignominy of an
  inquiry&mdash;the police court and that filth."</p>

  <p>Her senses were unnaturally keen. She heard a sound.</p>

  <p>"There's somebody coming up the stairs," she whispered. "Go into the
  bedroom&mdash;go quickly!"</p>

  <p>He hesitated, but she pushed him towards the room and ran rather than
  walked to the door and listened. She could hear soft, whispering voices.
  Switching on the table lamp, she found a book and opened it with trembling
  hands. There was a little sewing table in the spare room and she brought this
  out and had placed it near when the first thunderous knock sounded. She took
  one glimpse at herself in the hall mirror, used her pocket puff swiftly and
  opened the door.</p>

  <p>Two men were standing there: two tall, grim-looking figures of fate.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>It was an agonised effort to control her voice, but she succeeded.</p>

  <p>"My name is Bray&mdash;Detective-Inspector Bray, Criminal Investigation
  Department," he said formally. "This is Detective-Sergeant Elk."</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mrs. Landor."</p>

  <p>It was characteristic of Elk that he took complete charge of the
  proceedings from that moment. He had the affability of a man supremely
  confident of himself. "Come in," she said.</p>

  <p>"All right, Mrs. Landor, I'll shut the door," said Elk. They walked into
  the hall. She noticed that neither of the men removed his hat.</p>

  <p>She made one effort to appear unconcerned, tried to infuse a little gaiety
  into her voice.</p>

  <p>"I should have known you were detectives. I've seen so many in cinemas and
  I know detectives never take their hats off," she smiled.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bray would have taken this as a reproach. Elk was apparently amused,
  but supplied an explanation.</p>

  <p>"A detective who takes his hat off, Mrs. Landor," he said, "is a detective
  with one hand! In other words, the other hand is occupied when he may want to
  use two."</p>

  <p>"I hope you won't even want to use one," she said. "Will you sit down? Is
  it about Joan?"</p>

  <p>It was cruelly unfair to make this implied libel on an honest and decent
  servant, but she could not afford to be nice.</p>

  <p>"Don't make a noise, will you?" she added. "My husband is asleep."</p>

  <p>"He got asleep very quickly, Mrs. Landor," said Bray. "He only came in a
  few minutes ago."</p>

  <p>She forced a smile.</p>

  <p>"A few minutes ago! How absurd! He's been in bed since ten."</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, Mrs. Landor, did another man come into this flat?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Do you ever have burglars coming up the fire escape?" he asked, eyeing
  her quickly. She laughed at this.</p>

  <p>"I don't even know which way burglars come, but I never use the fire
  escape myself! I hope I never shall!"</p>

  <p>Elk paid tribute to the sally with a smile.</p>

  <p>"We'd like to see your husband," he said after a moment's consideration.
  "Which is his room? Is that it?" He pointed to a door near the hall.</p>

  <p>She had seated herself at the table where the open book was lying, her
  hands folded on her lap that they might not testify to her agitation. She
  rose now.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;that is the maid's room. My room is here, but I can't have him
  disturbed. He's not very well," she said. "He's had a fall."</p>

  <p>"Too bad," said Elk. "Which is his room?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer but walked across to the bedroom door and knocked.</p>

  <p>"Louis, there are some people who want to see you."</p>

  <p>He came in immediately. He was without coat and collar, but it needed no
  experienced observer to realise that he had been interrupted rather in the
  process of taking off his clothes than of dressing.</p>

  <p>"Were you getting up, darling?" she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>Elk shook his head reprovingly.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather you didn't suggest anything to him, Mrs. Landor. You may
  suggest the wrong things. That is a friendly tip."</p>

  <p>Louis looked from one to the other. He had heard Inez say "detectives"
  under her breath, but he did not need that explanation. Inspector Bray made
  one effort to control the inquiry.</p>

  <p>"I've reason to believe that you know a man who was staying at the Little
  Norfolk Hotel in Norfolk Street, Strand, and calling himself Donald
  Bateman."</p>

  <p>"No," said Inez quickly.</p>

  <p>"I'm asking your husband," said Bray sharply. "Well, Mr. Landor?"</p>

  <p>Louis shrugged.</p>

  <p>"I have no personal acquaintance with anybody named Donald Bateman."</p>

  <p>It was here that Elk resumed charge of the examination and his superior
  assented.</p>

  <p>"We don't want to know whether you're personally acquainted with him, Mr.
  Landor. That's entirely beside the question. Have you ever heard of, or have
  you in any way been associated with, a man called Donald Bateman, who arrived
  from South Africa in the last few weeks? Before you answer, I wish to tell
  you that Inspector Bray and I are investigating the circumstances under which
  this man met his death in Endley Street, Tidal Basin, at ten o'clock last
  night."</p>

  <p>"He's dead?" said Louis. "How did he die?"</p>

  <p>"By a knife wound," said Bray.</p>

  <p>He saw the woman sway on her feet.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about it," said Louis Landor. "I have never used a knife
  against any man."</p>

  <p>Elk's eyes were roving the curios on the wall. He took a step closer, and
  lifting the belt from the nail, laid it on the table.</p>

  <p>"What is this supposed to be?" He tapped the knife.</p>

  <p>"It's a knife I brought back from South America," said Louis immediately.
  "I had a ranch there."</p>

  <p>"Is it yours?"</p>

  <p>Louis nodded.</p>

  <p>"There were two in this belt," he said. "Where is the other?"</p>

  <p>"We lost it." Inez spoke quickly. "Louis lost it. We haven't had it for
  quite a long time&mdash;we've never had it in this house."</p>

  <p>Elk ran his finger along the belt.</p>

  <p>"There's dust here. There ought to be dust inside this empty frog," he
  said. "If the story is true and there has been no knife here for a long time,
  the inside would be thick with dust. On the other hand, if your story isn't
  true, there was a knife here to-day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He rubbed the inside of the leather and showed his finger practically
  speckless.</p>

  <p>"I dusted it myself this morning," said Inez, and Elk smiled at her
  admiringly.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Landor!" he said in reproach.</p>

  <p>"Well, I've got to tell the truth," she said desperately. "You want the
  truth, don't you?"</p>

  <p>She was on the verge of hysteria, near to the breaking-point which would
  leave her morally and physically shattered.</p>

  <p>"You're not entitled to draw inferences without my offering some
  explanation. God Almighty! Haven't I suffered enough through that man!"</p>

  <p>"Which man?" asked Bray sharply.</p>

  <p>She was silent.</p>

  <p>"Which man, Mrs. Landor?"</p>

  <p>Louis Landor at any rate had recovered his self-possession.</p>

  <p>"My wife isn't quite herself to-night," he said. "I have been out rather
  late and she got rather worried about me."</p>

  <p>"Now what's the use of making a mystery of something that's perfectly
  clear?" asked Elk.</p>

  <p>He was almost sad as he contemplated the futility of unnecessary
  evasion.</p>

  <p>"Your wife knew Donald Bateman?"</p>

  <p>Louis did not answer.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to be perfectly frank with you. I told you we were inquiring
  into the murder of this man. That is our duty as police officers. We're not
  asking you or your wife or anybody else who is the murderer of Donald
  Bateman. Understand that right, Mr. Landor. The only person we want is the
  murderer of this man! The people we don't want are those who didn't murder
  him, even though they know something of him. If either or both of you are
  responsible, I, my chief and the whole damned crowd of us at Scotland Yard
  will work night and day to bring you to the Old Bailey! That's treating you
  square. If you're not guilty, we'll do all we can to clear you. The only
  thing you can give us for the moment is the truth."</p>

  <p>"We've told the truth," said Inez breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"No, you haven't." Elk shook his head. "I didn't quite expect you would.
  The truth in every case like this is hidden under a heap of rubbishy lies.
  What are you hiding up, Mrs. Landor? It all comes down to that. You're hiding
  something and your husband's hiding something, that maybe doesn't matter ten
  loud hoots."</p>

  <p>"I'm hiding nothing," she said. "You knew Donald Bateman?"</p>

  <p>"I don't remember him," she said quickly.</p>

  <p>"You knew Donald Bateman." Elk was infinitely patient, and when she shook
  her head he put his hand slowly into his inside pocket. "Well, I don't want
  to give you an unpleasant experience, Mrs. Landor, but I've a photograph of
  this man&mdash;a flashlight picture taken after his death."</p>

  <p>She reeled back, her hands out-thrust. "I won't look at it! I won't! It's
  beastly... you're not allowed to show me things like that... I won't see
  it!"</p>

  <p>Louis's arm was round her, his cheek was against hers. He said something
  to her in an undertone, something which momentarily calmed her. Then he
  stretched out his hand to the detective.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I could identify this man," he said. "I know most of my wife's
  friends."</p>

  <p>Elk took from his pocket an envelope, and from this drew a positive that
  was still damp. It was not a pretty picture, but the hand which held the
  photograph did not tremble.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my wife knew this man ten years ago, when she was a girl of
  seventeen," said Louis.</p>

  <p>"When did you last see him?" asked Bray.</p>

  <p>Louis Landor thought.</p>

  <p>"A few years ago."</p>

  <p>"He only arrived in England last week," said Bray coldly.</p>

  <p>"He may have come to England every year, for all you know," said Louis
  with a faint smile. "No, I saw his photograph."</p>

  <p>"What did he call himself in those days, Mrs. Landor?"</p>

  <p>She was more composed now, her voice under control.</p>

  <p>"I knew him as Donald. He was just&mdash;an acquaintance."</p>

  <p>She heard Elk's murmured expostulation.</p>

  <p>"Surely, Mrs. Landor, you're not telling us the gospel truth, are you?" he
  asked. "Just now you told us you'd 'suffered enough from this man.' You can't
  suffer very deeply through any man whose name you couldn't remember except as
  Donald."</p>

  <p>She did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Can you, Mrs. Landor? You're not going to tell us? He was a very close
  friend, wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>She drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"I suppose he was. It's not a thing I want to talk about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Inez! I'm not going to allow these people to think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Elk interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"Never mind what we think, Mr. Landor. Nothing's going to shock us
  &mdash;not me, at any rate. You knew this man before you met your husband, I
  suppose, or was it after?"</p>

  <p>"It was before," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Was he anything&mdash;to you?"</p>

  <p>Elk found difficulty in putting the matter delicately. He saw the man's
  face go red and white.</p>

  <p>"You're being damned offensive, aren't you?" Louis was glowering at
  him.</p>

  <p>Elk shook his head wearily.</p>

  <p>"That's just what I'm not being. A man has been murdered to-night,
  Landor&mdash;and I'm anxious to put the murderer under lock and key, and it's
  only possible to put him under lock and key by asking all sorts of innocent
  people offensive questions. And when you come to think of it, there's nothing
  quite so offensive as stabbing a man to the heart and leaving him stiff on
  the paving-stones of Tidal Basin. It's a lousy place to die. Personally, I
  should be very much offended if it happened to me, and I'd regard any
  questions similar to those I am asking as being in the nature of a
  bouquet&mdash;in comparison. Did you know Donald Bateman was in town?" He
  addressed Inez.</p>

  <p>"No," she answered.</p>

  <p>Bray interjected impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell us you didn't know that he was in London three or
  four days ago?"</p>

  <p>"No!" Her tone was defiant.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Landor," said Elk, "you've been very unhappy this last day or two;
  your servant told us all about it. Servants will talk, and they love a little
  domestic tragedy."</p>

  <p>"I've not been well," she said.</p>

  <p>"Is it because you've seen Donald Bateman, the man from whom you
  suffered?"</p>

  <p>"No," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Nor you?" asked Bray.</p>

  <p>"No," answered Louis.</p>

  <p>"To-night, for instance?" suggested Elk. "You haven't seen Donald Bateman
  or the man so described?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Louis.</p>

  <p>"Have you been in the neighbourhood of Tidal Basin to-night?" asked Elk.
  "Before you answer that, I must caution you to be very careful how you
  reply."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Elk took a slip of paper from his pocket,</p>

  <p>"I'm going to ask you a question, Landor, which I'd like you to consider
  before you answer. In the pocket of the man known as Donald Bateman were
  found two one-hundred-pound notes, indicator number 33 lO 11878 and 331O
  11879. They were new notes, recently issued from the Maida Vale Branch of the
  Midland Bank. Can you tell me anything about these banknotes?"</p>

  <p>He was silent.</p>

  <p>"Can you, Mrs. Landor?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything about the numbers of banknotes&mdash;" she began
  desperately.</p>

  <p>"That's not what we're asking," said Bray sternly. "Have you given or sent
  to any person during the past week two bank-notes each for a hundred
  pounds?"</p>

  <p>"They come from my account," said Louis quietly. "I suppose I'd better
  tell the truth. We did know Donald Bateman was back in London. He wrote to us
  and said he was in great distress, and asked me for the loan of two hundred
  pounds."</p>

  <p>"I see," nodded Bray. "You sent them to his address in Norfolk Street by
  letter post?"</p>

  <p>Louis nodded.</p>

  <p>"Did he acknowledge receipt of the money?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Louis.</p>

  <p>"He didn't even call to thank you?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Inez.</p>

  <p>She spoke a little too quickly.</p>

  <p>"You're not going to tell us the truth, either of you." Elk's voice was
  rather sad. "Not the truth about this man or this money or your visit to
  Tidal Basin. You've a bruise on your face&mdash;been fighting?"</p>

  <p>"No, I hit it against a cupboard door."</p>

  <p>"Your wife said you fell down," said Elk drearily, "but it doesn't matter.
  Why do you keep these knives here?" He picked up the belt and dangled it in
  his hand.</p>

  <p>"Why does he keep these saddles on the wall?" asked Inez impatiently. "Be
  reasonable, please. They are prizes he got at a rodeo in the Argentine."</p>

  <p>"For what?" asked Bray.</p>

  <p>"It was a knife-throwing competition&mdash;" began Louis, and stopped.</p>

  <p>"Hiding up!" groaned Elk. "Get your coat on, Landor!"</p>

  <p>Inez Landor darted to him and caught him frantically by the arm.</p>

  <p>"You're not going to take him away?"</p>

  <p>"I'm taking you both away," said Elk cheerfully, "but only to Scotland
  Yard. You'll have to see Mr. Mason, but you needn't worry. He's a very
  sympathetic man&mdash;even more sympathetic than Mr. Bray."</p>

  <p>There was a touch of malignity in this thrust which Bray did not
  observe.</p>

  <p>She did not go into the bedroom with her husband; her own coat was lying
  on the back of a chair. She had quite forgotten that fact&mdash;saw now the
  absurdity of the reading-lamp, the sewing and the book whilst this raincoat
  of hers testified mutely to her wanderings.</p>

  <p>Louis came back in a very short space of time and helped her into the
  leather jacket.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, we've got a police-car downstairs; you needn't bother
  about a taxi," said Bray, in answer to his inquiry.</p>

  <p>He was a little huffy, being conscious that whatever result had been
  achieved brought him little personal kudos.</p>

  <p>"I shan't want you to come with me, Elk," he said shortly. "You can help
  shove these people into the car and then you can come back and search the
  flat. Would you like to see the warrant?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Louis shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing in the flat that I object to your seeing," he said, and
  pointed to the little escritoire. "There's about three thousand pounds in
  that drawer, and railway tickets. I was leaving the country to-morrow with my
  wife. Give Mr.&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Elk's my name."</p>

  <p>"Give Mr. Elk the keys, Inez."</p>

  <p>Without a word she handed the case to Elk.</p>

  <p>As they walked through the door of the flat Bray put out his hand and
  switched off the light. He was a domesticated man with a taste for economy,
  and he acted instinctively.</p>

  <p>"Save your light, Mrs. Landor," he apologised for his action.</p>

  <p>The door closed and the sound of their movement grew fainter to the
  listening man who stood behind the locked door of the maid's room. He came
  out noiselessly, a dark figure, a black felt hat pulled down over his eyes,
  his face hidden behind a white mask.</p>

  <p>Quickly he went to the desk, took something out of his pocket; there was
  the sound of breaking wood and the drawer slid out. A small pocket torch
  revealed what he sought, and he thrust money, passport and tickets into his
  pocket. He had hardly done so before he heard the detective returning, and
  moved swiftly towards the door. He was standing in its shadow when it opened.
  Elk's back was towards him when he heard a slight sound, and turned quickly.
  Not quickly enough. For the fraction of a second he glimpsed the white-faced
  thing, and then something struck him and he went down like a log.</p>

  <p>White Face stooped, dragged the inanimate figure a little way from the
  door so that it would open, and a second later had slipped out of the flat,
  leaving the door ajar.</p>

  <p>He ran up one flight of stairs, passed through an open window and went
  swiftly down a narrow iron stairway which brought him to the courtyard. There
  was no guard here, as he knew.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later one of the detectives waiting outside the house went
  upstairs to proffer his assistance to Elk. He heard a groan and, pushing the
  door open, found the sergeant in his least amiable mood.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SUPERINTENDENT MASON boasted that he could sleep anywhere at
  any time. He certainly needed a considerable amount of rousing when the
  police car reached Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>As for Michael Quigley, he had never felt less sleepy in his life, and the
  coffee which was brought to the superintendent's room was as a stimulant
  quite unnecessary. It brought Mr. Mason to irritable life.</p>

  <p>His complaint was that, at whatever hour of the day or night he arrived at
  Scotland Yard, he was certain to find some official document waiting for his
  attention. There were half a dozen minutes warningly inscribed and heavily
  sealed.</p>

  <p>"They can wait till the morning." He examined the two or three telephone
  messages that were on his desk, but they told him nothing new. There was no
  news from Bray. It was a quarter of an hour later that Elk and his superior
  had their interview with the Landors.</p>

  <p>Michael looked at his watch. It was too late to go to bed. He wanted to
  see Janice early in the morning.</p>

  <p>"You can call back and I'll tell you anything that's going," said Mason.
  "About that ring, Michael: I'm afraid we shall have to have a little talk
  with the young lady. I'll make it as pleasant as possible. Maybe you can
  arrange for us to meet&mdash;I don't want to bring her down to the Yard,
  because that would rattle her."</p>

  <p>Michael was grateful for this concession. Ever since he had told Mason the
  truth about the ring, a dull little shadow of worry had rested in his
  mind.</p>

  <p>"You're a pretty nice man for a policeman, Mason."</p>

  <p>"I'm a pretty nice man for any kind of job," said the superintendent.</p>

  <p>Michael strolled out on to the Embankment and up through Northumberland
  Avenue. He had reached Trafalgar Square and was standing at the corner of the
  Strand, wondering whether it would be sensible to go home and snatch a few
  hours' sleep, or whether to call at his club, which was open till four
  o'clock, when a taxicab went rapidly past him in the direction of the
  Admiralty gate. Midnight taxicabs either crawl or fly, and this one was
  moving quickly&mdash;not so swift, however, that he did not glimpse a
  familiar figure sitting on the box, a pipe clenched between his teeth. If he
  had been moving more slowly Michael would have hailed old Gregory Wicks.</p>

  <p>"Did you want a cab, Mr. Quigley?" It was a policeman by his side; Michael
  was fairly well known to this division. "No, thank you."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were trying to stop that driver. They take liberties, those
  fellows."</p>

  <p>Michael laughed.</p>

  <p>"That was an old friend of mine. I suppose you know him&mdash;old Gregory
  Wicks?"</p>

  <p>"Gregory, eh?" The policeman was a middle-aged man who knew his West End
  extremely well. "The old fellow's getting about again. I hadn't seen him for
  months till I saw him the other night sleeping on his box at the corner of
  Orange Street. He lost a good fare that night. I wanted him to take Mr. Gasso
  down to Scotland Yard to make a statement&mdash;I was in that case," he added
  a little proudly.</p>

  <p>Chance policemen encountered in the middle of the night can be very
  talkative, and Michael was in no mood for conversation. But the mention of
  Gasso arrested his attention.</p>

  <p>"You were in what case?"</p>

  <p>"The Howdah case. You know, the night they held up Mrs. What's-her-
  name&mdash;Duval or something, and pinched her diamond chain. Naturally my
  name hasn't been mentioned because the case has never been into court, but I
  was on point duty near the Howdah Club when the robbery occurred. If anybody
  had screamed, or I'd heard 'em scream, I'd have been on the spot in a second.
  It only shows you what chances you miss because people won't behave
  sensibly."</p>

  <p>Michael gathered that behaving sensibly was synonymous with screaming
  violently.</p>

  <p>"Old Gregory was about here that night, was he?"</p>

  <p>"He had his cab about fifty yards from the club. He never joins a rank,
  and, knowing him, we aren't very strict. If he can find a nice quiet corner
  to have his snooze we never disturb him."</p>

  <p>Old Gregory! Then in a flash Michael remembered the mysterious words of
  the nondescript of Gallows Court: "What was the matter with Gregory?"</p>

  <p>Here was a new angle to many problems. He made a quick decision. Calling a
  more leisurely taxi, he drove off to Tidal Basin. Gallows Court had something
  to tell, and since Gallows Court never slept it might be more instructive in
  the middle of the night than in the broad and hateful light of day.</p>

  <p>Shale arrived at Scotland Yard simultaneously with the telephoned news
  that Bray was on his way accompanied by the two people he had been sent to
  seek. Mr. Mason leaned back in his chair and rubbed his hands. He was
  relieved. To find suspects quietly was more desirable than telling all the
  world they were wanted; for a suspect, having gained much undesirable
  publicity, very often proves to be perfectly innocent. Questions are asked in
  Parliament, and there have been cases where payment has had to be made as
  compensation for the wounded feelings of someone called urgently to police
  investigations.</p>

  <p>Parliament had been playing too interfering a part in the police force
  lately. A new Commissioner had come and was taking credit for all the reforms
  his subordinates had forced upon his predecessor. The Home Office had issued
  new instructions which, if they were faithfully carried out, would prevent
  the police from asking vital questions. Every step that the crank and the
  busybody could devise to interfere with the administration of justice had
  assumed official shape.</p>

  <p>Superintendent Mason knew the regulations by heart. One had to know them
  to evade them. Like every other high official of Scotland Yard, he lived at
  the mercy of stupid policemen and the perjury of some eminent man's light o'
  love. But the risk did not sit heavily upon him.</p>

  <p>Wender, of the Identification Bureau, was ready to see him, and he sent
  Shale to bring that long-suffering man, with his data.</p>

  <p>Wender was a small, stout gentleman with a tiny white moustache, and the
  huge horn-rimmed spectacles he wore did not add any measure of wisdom to his
  face, but rather emphasised its placidity. He arrived with a bundle of
  documents under his arm and a short briar pipe between his teeth. He was
  wearing a smoking-jacket, for he had been at a theatre when he was called to
  make a examination of the few clues which had been acquired in the case.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Charlie," said Mason. "It's good to see somebody looking
  cheerful at this hour of the morning."</p>

  <p>"I'm always cheerful because I'm always right," said Wender, pulling up a
  chair and sitting down.</p>

  <p>"Why the fancy dress?" asked Shale, who was Wender's brother-in-law, and
  could therefore be flippant with his superior.</p>

  <p>"Theatre," said his relative briefly.</p>

  <p>He was indeed an equable and happy man at all hours of the day and night.
  Nothing disturbed him. He was, too, something more than an authority upon
  fingerprints. The range of his information was astounding.</p>

  <p>"Before we start discussing whorls, islands and circles," said Mason, as
  he took from his pocket the capsule and laid it on the blotting-pad, "what is
  this?"</p>

  <p>Wender took it up and turned it over between his fingers.</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;butyl ammonal, I should think. I've seen it done up in
  capsules like that. Where did you find it?"</p>

  <p>Mason told him.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure, of course," said Wender, "not having a nose that can smell
  through a glass case, but it's that colour. Now, what else did you want to
  know?"</p>

  <p>"Is there any record of the Landors?" asked Mason.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wender shook his head.</p>

  <p>"None whatever. That doesn't mean we haven't got a record under another
  name. It's a curious circumstance"&mdash;he smiled brightly &mdash;"that
  criminals occasionally give themselves names that they weren't born with. I
  took this particular job on myself," he explained, "because my night man is
  about as useful as a performing flea." He laid the documents on the table.
  "There you are."</p>

  <p>"Have you got the finger-prints of the dead man?"</p>

  <p>The identification man sorted them out</p>

  <p>"Yes. Who took them?"</p>

  <p>"I did," admitted Shale.</p>

  <p>"They were of no use to me&mdash;the first lot, I mean. I had to send down
  and get another lot. You young officers are still rather hazy as to how to
  take a print."</p>

  <p>Mason examined the cards with their black smudges. They meant nothing to
  him.</p>

  <p>"Is he known?"</p>

  <p>"Is he known!" scoffed Wender. He sorted out another document. "Donald
  Arthur Bateman, alias Donald Arthur, alias Donald Mackintosh. He's got more
  aliases than a film star."</p>

  <p>Mason frowned heavily.</p>

  <p>"Donald Arthur Bateman? I know that name. Why, I had him at the London
  Sessions for housebreaking."</p>

  <p>"Fraud," corrected the other. "Twelve months hard labour, 1919."</p>

  <p>Mason nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's right&mdash;fraud. He swindled Sir Somebody Something out of three
  thousand pounds&mdash;a land deal. That was his speciality. And then he was
  up again at the Old Bailey&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Acquitted," said Wender. "The prosecutor had something to hide up and was
  too ill to give evidence. There's a conviction here at the Exeter
  Assizes&mdash;eighteen months, the Teignmouth blackmail case. You won't
  remember that: it was in the hands of the locals; they didn't call in the
  Yard."</p>

  <p>"Then he went abroad."</p>

  <p>"And died there! Semi-officially!"</p>

  <p>Mason read the note.</p>

  <p>"Reported dead in Perth, Western Australia, in 1923. Doubtful. Believed to
  have gone to South Africa."</p>

  <p>"He's dead enough now," he added.</p>

  <p>He brooded over the card.</p>

  <p>"Blackmail, fraud, fraud, blackmail... he was versatile. Married, of
  course... dozens of times, I should think. Went to Australia; concerned with
  the brothers Walter and Thomas Furse in holding up the Woomarra branch of the
  South Australian Bank. Offered King's evidence... accepted; no prosecution.
  Walter Furse eight years penal servitude, Thomas Furse three years. Walter an
  habitual criminal; Thomas, who had only arrived in Victoria from England a
  month before his conviction, released after two years."</p>

  <p>He read it aloud.</p>

  <p>"That's our Tommy," said Shale. "You remember the woman said, 'Tommy did
  it'?"</p>

  <p>But Mason was reading the "confidential." It was written in minute type
  and he had recourse to his reading glass.</p>

  <p>"'During their imprisonment,'" he read, "'Bateman disappeared, taking with
  him the young wife of Thomas.'" He looked up. "That's Lorna. 'Walter Furse
  died in prison in 1935.' Tommy's the murderer, Lorna's his wife, Bateman's
  the murdered man. It's as clear as daylight. There's the motive!"</p>

  <p>"What do we know about Tommy? Have you any Australian records?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Wender had laid three paper-covered books on the table. He selected
  one of these.</p>

  <p>"In this office we have everything that opens and shuts," he boasted.
  "Here you are: 'Strictly confidential. Record of persons convicted of felony
  in the State of Victoria, 1922. Published by authority'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind about the authority," said Mason patiently.</p>

  <p>The identification man turned over the leaves rapidly, murmuring the names
  that appeared at the head of each column.</p>

  <p>"'Farrow, Felton, Ferguson, Furse'&mdash;here you are: 'Walter Furse, see
  volume 6, page 13.'"</p>

  <p>He pushed the book to Mason. This collection was more interesting than
  most Government Blue Books, for the record of every man was in the form of a
  short and readable biography.</p>

  <p>'Thomas Furse. This man was educated in England by his brother; was
  probably unaware of his brother's illegal occupation when he came to the
  Colony. Furse was certainly an assumed name (see W. Furse, Vol. 8, p. 7), and
  there is a possibility that he was educated under his own name by his brother
  and with his brother's money, though he adopted the name of Furse when he
  came to the Colony. He married Lorna Weston&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Mason stopped reading to look up.</p>

  <p>'He married Lorna Weston, whom he met on the voyage out to Australia. She
  disappeared after his conviction. Thomas released... '</p>

  <p>He read on in silence, and presently closed the book. "The identity of
  these people is now positively established," he said. "The motive is here for
  anyone who can read. Thomas goes to Australia; within a month or two he is
  caught for this hold-up and gets two years. Donald Arthur Bateman turns
  King's evidence and disappears with Lorna. Thomas comes back to England and
  in some way meets Donald last night. Now the only question is: is Thomas
  Furse another name for Louis Landor? That's what we've got to find out. If it
  is, then we have the case in a nutshell."</p>

  <p>There were one or two other documents, and he turned them over.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" he asked. It was a large photograph of a thumb-print.</p>

  <p>"That was on the back of the watch," said Wender. "Harry Lamborn, as plain
  as a visiting-card. Five convictions&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know all about him," interrupted Mason.</p>

  <p>"A fine print," said Wender ecstatically.</p>

  <p>"You ought to have it framed, Charlie," said Mason in his more
  complimentary mood. "I shan't want you any more."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll toddle home to bed." Mr. Wender stretched himself and yawned.
  "If I haven't brought somebody to the gallows my evening has been
  wasted."</p>

  <p>"You'll get the usual medal and star," said Mason.</p>

  <p>"I know," said the other sardonically; "and when I put my expense account
  in&mdash;a cab from the Lyceum to Scotland Yard&mdash;they'll tell me I ought
  to have taken a 'bus!"</p>

  <p>He had left when Bray came importantly into the room.</p>

  <p>"I've got those people."</p>

  <p>"Eh?" Mason looked up. He was reading again the account of Thomas Furse.
  No age was given, which was rather annoying, but he could put a beam cable
  inquiry through to Melbourne and find an answer waiting for him when he came
  back to the office.</p>

  <p>"You've got those people, have you? Did you search the flat?"</p>

  <p>"I left Elk to do that."</p>

  <p>Mason nodded.</p>

  <p>"What are they hiding up?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I don't quite know. I should have found out, but
  unfortunately Elk is a little difficult. I don't want to complain, Chief, but
  I'm placed in an awkward position when a subordinate takes a case out of my
  hands and starts investigating and cross-questioning, taking no more notice
  of me than if I were the paper on the wall!"</p>

  <p>"He does it with me," Mason smiled broadly. "Why shouldn't he do it with
  you? As a matter of fact, you oughtn't to complain. These darned regulations
  about questioning prisoners are so framed that it's good to have some other
  officer responsible for breaking them&mdash;you can always pass the kick on
  to him. Shoot 'em in, Bray."</p>

  <p>He laughed quietly to himself after Bray had left. Elk was incorrigible,
  but Elk was invaluable. There was some odd kink in his mind which prevented
  his passing the educational test which would raise him to the dignity of
  inspector. For the fourth time Mason determined to beard the Commissioners
  and demand promotion for his erratic subordinate.</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet when the door opened and Inez came in ahead of her
  husband. She was more composed than he had expected, not quite so white. He
  went across the room to shake hands with her, an unusual and unexpected
  greeting which momentarily took her aback.</p>

  <p>"I'm terribly sorry to bring you out in the middle of the night, Mrs.
  Landor." His voice was at its most sympathetic. "If it had been any less
  serious case I wouldn't have bothered either you or your husband; but here we
  are, all of us up and doing when we want to be in bed, in the sacred name of
  justice, as the poet says."</p>

  <p>He personally placed a chair for her. Shale put a chair for Mr.
  Landor.</p>

  <p>"I hope we've not alarmed you&mdash;that was worrying me." His voice
  betrayed an almost tender solicitude. "But, as I say, in a case of this
  character it very often happens that decent citizens are put to
  inconvenience."</p>

  <p>It was Louis Landor who answered.</p>

  <p>"I'm not at all worried, but it is rather unpleasant for my wife."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," agreed Mason understandingly.</p>

  <p>He sat down and pulled his chair a little nearer to the desk, looking up
  at Bray.</p>

  <p>"Now what has Mr. Landor told you?"</p>

  <p>Bray took out a notebook. He had kept his charges at Scotland Yard for a
  quarter of an hour while he had jotted down with fair accuracy the gist of
  the statements which they had made to him.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Landor knew the murdered man, and Mr. Landor knew him also
  slightly," he read. "The two notes for a hundred pounds found in the pocket
  were given to the deceased by Mr. Landor, who says it was in the nature of a
  loan. This statement was made after Mr. Landor had said that he did not know
  Donald Bateman."</p>

  <p>Mason nodded.</p>

  <p>"Subsequently he admitted he did?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He also said he'd never been in Tidal Basin. Mrs. Landor said that
  the murdered man was a very intimate friend of hers many years ago, but she
  hasn't seen him since. She has been married five years, was the widow of a
  man named John Smith. In the flat I found a belt with a place for two knives.
  One of the knives I found." He put it on the table. "The other was
  missing."</p>

  <p>Mason took up the knife and pulled it from its sheath, looked at the
  little gold plate with the initials.</p>

  <p>"L.L.&mdash;those are your initials?"</p>

  <p>Landor nodded.</p>

  <p>"Where did the other knife go?"</p>

  <p>Bray supplied the answer from his notes.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Landor said it was lost. Both knives were presented to her husband
  at a rodeo competition in Central America for his skill in knife-throwing."
  He closed his book with a snap. "That is all the statement they made."</p>

  <p>Mason's face was very serious.</p>

  <p>"You agree that that was what you said to-night to Inspector Bray?" and,
  when they answered in the affirmative: "Would you like to amplify or correct
  that statement in any way?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Louis.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to point out, sir," interrupted Bray, "that he has a bruise on
  his face. He said he knocked it against the door; Mrs. Landor said he got it
  as the result of a fall."</p>

  <p>"Would you like to make a statement of any kind?" asked Mason.</p>

  <p>Louis Landor drew a quick breath.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think so."</p>

  <p>"Have you any objection if I ask you a few questions?"</p>

  <p>Landor hesitated.</p>

  <p>"No." The word seemed forced from him.</p>

  <p>"Or your wife?"</p>

  <p>Inez shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I'll make it as easy as I can. I realise it is very trying for you. Have
  you ever been to Australia?"</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Landor replied instantly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, many years ago. I made a voyage round the world with my father. I
  was very young at the time."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever meet there or at any other place a man named Donald Arthur
  Bateman who, I happen to know, was an ex-convict?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You say you have never been to Tidal Basin? If I tell you that you were
  recognised as having been seen in the vicinity of Endley Street fighting with
  Bateman, would you deny it?"</p>

  <p>It was a bluff on Mason's part, but it came off.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't deny it&mdash;no."</p>

  <p>Mason beamed.</p>

  <p>"That's sensible! There's no need to hide anything." He was his solicitous
  self again. "Now just forget the statement you made to Mr. Bray and we'll
  forget it, too," he smiled. "You're hiding something. To save you or your
  wife from some imaginary danger you're implicating yourself further and
  further in the crime of wilful murder. Now, what are you afraid of?"</p>

  <p>Louis Landor avoided his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You're probably hiding something that doesn't matter two hoots. What does
  matter"&mdash;he emphasised every sentence with a tap of his finger on the
  pad&mdash;"is that I have sufficient evidence to charge you with murder. You
  were in Tidal Basin; a knife similar to this&mdash;I have the
  sheath&mdash;was used in the murder of Bateman, and you have been paying, or
  have paid, money to the dead man which is traceable to your banking account.
  Now, why?"</p>

  <p>Bray asserted himself.</p>

  <p>"You're not going to stick to the story that you did it as an act of
  kindness&mdash;" he began, and then he caught Mason's eye, and saw there no
  encouragement to intervene.</p>

  <p>"You were being blackmailed: isn't that the truth?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's the truth." It was Inez who spoke. "That is the truth! I can
  tell you that."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mason's nods were not ordinary nods: they were an inclination of head
  not unlike the reverent obeisance before the statue of a heathen deity.</p>

  <p>"Exactly. The murdered man knew that you or your wife had committed some
  offence, whether against the law&mdash;" he paused expectantly.</p>

  <p>"I'm not prepared to say," said Louis quickly.</p>

  <p>"You're prepared to go in the dock on a charge of wilful murder, and your
  wife is prepared to let you. Is that what I understand?"</p>

  <p>She was shaking her head, momentarily inarticulate.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. You were being blackmailed."</p>

  <p>"Yes." It came faintly from Inez.</p>

  <p>"What had you done? Had you murdered somebody? Robbed somebody?" His jaw
  dropped. Into his eyes came a look of intense amusement which was
  particularly out of place. "I know! You had committed bigamy!"</p>

  <p>"No," said Louis.</p>

  <p>"This man Bateman was your husband." His forefinger pointed to her. "He
  was alive when you married your present husband. Isn't that the truth?"</p>

  <p>"I thought he was dead." Her voice was very low, but he heard every word.
  "I was sure of it. I had the newspaper cutting. He told me when I saw him
  that he circulated the story because he wanted the police off his track for
  some crime he had committed in England. I swear I didn't know."</p>

  <p>Again Mason leaned back in his chair, and his thumbs went into the
  armholes of his waistcoat.</p>

  <p>"Even Scotland Yard didn't know, Mrs. Landor. I've got it here." He tapped
  the pile of documents at his elbow. "Reported dead in Australia. Good God!
  What a thing to worry about&mdash;bigamy! That's hardly an offence&mdash;you
  ought to get something out of the poor-box for that! And that's what you've
  been hiding up? When did you see him last?"</p>

  <p>The eyes of the husband and wife met, and Louis nodded.</p>

  <p>"To-day," said the woman.</p>

  <p>"You heard he was in London four days ago," interrupted Bray. "Your
  servant said you'd been distressed for four days."</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"You can answer that," said Mason, and his permission would have been a
  rebuff to any other man but Mr. Bray.</p>

  <p>"He wrote&mdash;I couldn't believe he was alive."</p>

  <p>Bateman knew they were well off; suggested she should pay him money,
  threatening to publish the story of her bigamy. He arrived from South Africa
  penniless, having met some sharper crooks on the boat, who had taken what
  little money he had had when he embarked. But he had excellent prospects, he
  told her.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mason dryly, "I know her name."</p>

  <p>He settled himself deeper in his chair and clasped his hands before him.
  He knew he was now coming to the really delicate part of his
  investigations.</p>

  <p>"He called at your house&mdash;when?"</p>

  <p>"To-day," she said.</p>

  <p>"Did he call yesterday&mdash;for the money?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, that was posted."</p>

  <p>"Then what did he call about to-day? To thank you?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Your husband was out?"</p>

  <p>She was looking straight at the wall ahead of her; he saw her lips
  quivering.</p>

  <p>"Was he&mdash;affectionate?"</p>

  <p>Bray was nearest to her, and caught her before she slid to the floor.</p>

  <p>"All right, get some water."</p>

  <p>There was a water bottle on the mantelpiece. Shale poured out a glassful.
  Presently her eyes opened and her husband lifted her into the arm-chair which
  Bray pushed forward.</p>

  <p>"You needn't ask her anything more," Landor said. "I can tell you
  everything."</p>

  <p>"I think you can," said Mason. "What time did you arrive at the flat
  yesterday&mdash;after this man had seen your wife?"</p>

  <p>"Immediately after. I passed him on the stairs, but didn't know who he
  was."</p>

  <p>"And yet you recognised him in the photograph?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen him since: I've admitted that, or practically admitted it, when
  I said I was in Tidal Basin."</p>

  <p>"You found your wife very upset? She told you what it was all about?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"And you went after him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," defiantly.</p>

  <p>"With a knife similar to this?"</p>

  <p>Inez Landor came up to her feet at this, her hand on the table.</p>

  <p>"That's a lie! He didn't go after him with a knife," she said
  passionately. "Donald took the knife&mdash;he took it from me. I'll tell you
  the truth. I tried to kill him. I snatched the knife from the wall. I hated
  him! For all the years I had with him, for all that I suffered when he was
  out of prison, for my baby who died because of his beastliness!"</p>

  <p>There was a silence. Mason could hear her quick breathing.</p>

  <p>"He took the knife from you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He said he'd keep it as a souvenir, and took the sheath and put it
  in his pocket. You know what he wanted, don't you? He wanted me to live with
  him again." Her voice rose. Mason had come round to the side of his desk and
  took her arm in his big hand and literally pushed her back into the
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Gently, Mrs. Landor. Don't get rattled. You're doing fine."</p>

  <p>He looked round to Louis.</p>

  <p>"You followed this man to Tidal Basin and fought with him. Did you know he
  had the knife in his pocket?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know anything about it till my wife told me on the telephone. I
  didn't see the knife or use it."</p>

  <p>"Why did you run away?" asked Mason.</p>

  <p>Again Louis paused before he answered.</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd killed him... my wife begged me not to touch him. He had
  some sort of heart disease."</p>

  <p>Mason nodded many times.</p>

  <p>"And carried butyl ammonal in his pocket?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Inez eagerly, "a little thing he crushed in a handkerchief and
  inhaled. He always carried that."</p>

  <p>Mason began to walk slowly up and down the room, his hands in his
  pockets.</p>

  <p>"You bolted, and found a door open in the gate of the Eastern Trading
  Company. I call it the beer door: you won't understand why, and I can't
  explain. And that's all you know about it?"</p>

  <p>"As God is my judge," said Landor.</p>

  <p>"You never threw a knife or used a knife?"</p>

  <p>"I'll swear I never did."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear all the commotion when we were outside the gate?"</p>

  <p>Louis shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, I was trying to find a way out of the yard. I didn't come back to
  that gate again for an hour. I was hiding part of the time and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And how did&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mason got so far when the door was flung violently open. Mason stared in
  amazement at the man who stood there. It was Elk, part of his face hidden in
  white bandages. He stood at the door, supporting himself by the lintel, and
  glared with a certain malignity at his immediate superior.</p>

  <p>"For the love of Allah, what has happened?"</p>

  <p>"Don't touch me," snarled Elk, as Bray made a motion to assist him. "I
  don't want anybody with a higher rank than sergeant to help me!"</p>

  <p>He glared down at Inez.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear anybody come into your flat before your husband
  returned?"</p>

  <p>"I thought I did," she said.</p>

  <p>"How right you were! He was there, in the maid's room, waiting for me when
  I came back, and coshed me. He couldn't have got in without a key."</p>

  <p>"Where are your keys?" asked Mason, and Louis started.</p>

  <p>"I lost them... I lost them in the fight. I didn't miss them until I was
  on my way back there, and then I found the broken end of the chain
  &mdash;look."</p>

  <p>He showed it: a gold chain dangling by the side of his trousers.</p>

  <p>Elk staggered across to where Louis was standing and tapped him heavily on
  the chest.</p>

  <p>"There's a desk in your hall," he said slowly. "Did you keep anything
  valuable in the top drawer&mdash;money?"</p>

  <p>Louis stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Stop hiding up, will you?" snapped Mason. "What was in that top
  drawer?"</p>

  <p>"Money, passports and tickets," said Louis Landor huskily. "I was clearing
  out to-morrow and taking my wife away from this man."</p>

  <p>"How much money?" demanded Elk.</p>

  <p>"About three thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Elk laughed mirthlessly.</p>

  <p>"There's about nothing now! It's gone! The drawer was broken open and the
  money taken. I'll tell you something more, Mason." His outrageous familiarity
  passed unnoticed. "The fellow that coshed me was White Face! I'm not
  romancing&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>Mason interrupted him with an impatient gesture.</p>

  <p>"Of course it was White Face. It could be nobody else but White Face. I've
  known that all along," he said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MICHAEL QUIGLEY had never been alone through Gallows Court
  by day or night. He stood hesitant at the entrance and experienced a qualm of
  uneasiness which was foreign to him. He looked up and down the street vainly
  for a policeman, and rather wished he had detained the taxi-driver. Yet
  Gallows Court differed from no other noisome thoroughfare; there were
  thousands of them in every great city, none more mysterious or sinister than
  the other. Two hundred years ago, when bravoes lurked in these dens, there
  might be another tale to tell; but here was the twentieth century; a highly
  organised police force, housing societies and sanitary inspectors prying into
  the darkest places without hurt to themselves. Not in the early hours of the
  morning, said a warning voice.</p>

  <p>But they would be asleep now.</p>

  <p>It was one of Mr. Mason's figures of speech that the inmates of the court
  never slept. But he was rather prone to exaggeration. Mike looked up at the
  facade of Dr. Marford's surgery. The windows of the top room were open. This
  was evidently his sleeping-room&mdash;he had had a faint hope that the doctor
  would still be about. Summoning his resolution, he walked into the dark
  entry. There was no sign or sound of life. Every window in the court was
  black.</p>

  <p>Either the storm or some human piece of mischief had extinguished the
  gas-lamp at the far end of the court. Groping his way along, feeling at the
  wall, he presently touched the door which gave into the doctor's yard. It was
  fastened, and he went on a little farther. Then suddenly he stopped, with his
  heart in his mouth. He had heard a groan, a deep, a painful groan that ended
  in a long-drawn "Oh-h!"</p>

  <p>Where had it come from? He looked around fearfully, but could see nothing.
  And then he heard the groan again. It seemed to come from somewhere near him.
  He waited, determined to locate the sound, but it was not repeated. Instead
  came a soft cackle of laughter which made every hair on his head stand up.
  And then a hoarse voice spoke.</p>

  <p>"Go on, Mr. Reporter, nobody's going to hurt ya!"</p>

  <p>He recognised the speaker, though he could not see him. It was the crazy
  man who had followed Mason and him into the street.</p>

  <p>"Rats, ain't we? Eyes like rats," he said. "I heard ya! I hear
  everything!"</p>

  <p>Michael edged towards the voice, and then saw an indistinguishable black
  mass huddled against the wall.</p>

  <p>"I know where ya going!" The crazy unknown spoke in a thick whisper. "Ya
  going to see what's wrong with old Gregory&mdash;clever! Cleverer than Mason.
  Here!" An invisible hand clutched his overcoat. Michael had to use all his
  self-control to prevent wrenching himself free. "I'll tell you something."
  The whisper grew more confidential. "They ain't found Rudd &mdash;the police
  doctor. They're out on the river with their drags, raking up the old mud, but
  they ain't found him."</p>

  <p>The unseen creature laughed until he broke into a fit of coughing.</p>

  <p>"All the busies and all the coppers in Tidal Basin lookin' for old Rudd!
  Do you think he's a good doctor&mdash;I don't! I wouldn't let him doctor me.
  Tell 'em what I say at the station, mister&mdash;have a lark with 'em! Tell
  'em he's under a barge!"</p>

  <p>Then the detaining claws released their grip.</p>

  <p>"Blue Face is asleep down there on old Gregory's doorstep. Blue Face
  &mdash;not White Face."</p>

  <p>Again the long gurgle of laughter that ended in a paroxysm of coughing.
  Michael drew himself away and went on till he came to No. 9. The sleeper he
  had seen sat hunched up on the doorstep of Gregory Wicks, the can still
  balanced on his knees. His arms were folded, his head bent forward. He was
  snoring regularly.</p>

  <p>Michael did not dare go back the way he had come. He went out of the lower
  end of the court, came round the block and found the crazy man leaning
  against the wall of the entry.</p>

  <p>"Old Gregory's back&mdash;been back a quarter of an hour. An old man like
  him oughtn't to drive taxicabs&mdash;and I'm the only man that knows why he
  oughtn't! Dr. Marford knows, but he's not the feller that goes snouting on
  his patients."</p>

  <p>"Snouting" meant "nosing," and "nosing" meant "informing." Dr. Marford was
  credited with having been the recipient of secrets which it would have
  terrified his more opulent brethren even to hear.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with old Gregory Wicks? That's what I'm asking ya?"</p>

  <p>And then, without warning, the crazy man turned abruptly and ran
  noiselessly through the dark entry. He must have been either in stockinged or
  bare feet, for he made no sound, but moved with uncanny silence. He might
  have been the wraith of all that was ugly and wicked in the court.</p>

  <p>But he had told Michael one thing he wanted to know. Gregory had returned,
  had been back a quarter of an hour. Michael walked slowly to the police
  station and interviewed the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"No, we haven't found Dr. Rudd. The river police are searching. There's a
  chance he may have gone up west. He's got a flat near Langham Place and he
  may turn up there later. Mr. Mason is on his way here, if you want to see
  him."</p>

  <p>"Why is he coming back?" asked Michael in surprise, but the station
  sergeant could or would give information on this point.</p>

  <p>Michael was relieved: he wished for no better news, for he was desperately
  anxious to see the superintendent.</p>

  <p>"Personally, I'm not worried about Rudd." The station sergeant could drop
  all ceremonious titles with a sympathetic and understanding audience. "He's a
  funny old chap&mdash;I don't know how old he is, but he's young compared with
  Methuselah. If a man's got money, he oughtn't to be messing about in this
  neigbourhood."</p>

  <p>"Has he got money?"</p>

  <p>"Whips of it," said the sergeant. "An old lady, one of his patients, died
  and left him a packet! If he'd been a better doctor she might have been
  living now," he added libellously.</p>

  <p>He patted back a yawn.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's got tons of money. He owns a flat in the West End of London.
  Some of the Special Branch fellers from Scotland Yard tell me they often see
  him in the night clubs. Thank God, a man's never too old to be silly!"</p>

  <p>Michael, who knew the area well, had never seriously considered Dr. Rudd
  as an individual. There are some characters who fail utterly to inspire the
  least interest in themselves. They are figures&mdash;men or women occupying
  set places, who have no existence other than the existence which is visible
  to their casual acquaintances. Whether they eat or drink, have home lives or
  private predilections, is hardly worth speculating upon. It is almost
  surprising to discover that they play bridge or have the gift of
  distinguishing between Chateau Lafitte and Imperial Tokay. Whatever they do
  that is human appears as an amazing phenomenon.</p>

  <p>He brought Dr. Rudd out of the background of his mind and tried to examine
  him as an entity, but he was either too tired or too bored to give this
  shadowy figure significance.</p>

  <p>Mason came with Bray and Shale, and the superintendent was in his most
  rollicking mood. You might have thought he had risen from a long and
  refreshing sleep; he greeted Michael jovially.</p>

  <p>But the news which the station sergeant gave him wiped the smile from his
  face.</p>

  <p>"What?" he said. "Rudd hasn't turned up?"</p>

  <p>He had quite forgotten Dr. Rudd, for, like Michael, he found that elusive
  personality difficult to place. He did not speak for a long time, but stood
  in front of the fire, warming his hands.</p>

  <p>"I'm not as worried about him as I should be," he said. "He's a queer
  bird, and gets me on the raw quicker than any man I know, though I hope I've
  never shown it. I can't feel that he's anything to worry about."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you something to worry about, if you'll give me a few minutes,"
  said Michael, and the superintendent looked at him sharply.</p>

  <p>"That sounds to me like a threat. All right. Can we have your room,
  Bray?"</p>

  <p>Bray looked a little sour that he was not invited to the conference. He
  disliked these crime reporters, and made no disguise of his antipathy. And
  crime reporters disliked him and maliciously spelt his name wrong if they
  mentioned it at all.</p>

  <p>Behind the closed door of the inspector's room Michael revealed all his
  suspicions, and Mr. Mason listened, making very few comments.</p>

  <p>"I've had that idea in my mind, too," he said. "I'm not kidding you, Mike,
  or trying to jump in and take credit for your brain's work. But old Gregory
  Wicks is as straight as a die. I've known him since I was a boy. I was born
  in this neighbourhood, but don't want you to tell anybody this. Gregory's got
  the finest record of any cabman in London&mdash;the amount of property that
  fellow's restored to the rightful owners runs into five figures."</p>

  <p>"He limps, doesn't he?" asked Michael, and Mason's brows knitted.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he limps," he said slowly. "He was thrown from the seat of a cab
  years ago. Of course he limps," he went on thoughtfully. "Now, why on earth
  did I forget that?"</p>

  <p>"You told me that the man who was seen coming out of Mrs. Weston's flat
  also limped?"</p>

  <p>Mason nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes; I hadn't connected the two people. But Gregory Wicks!" He laughed.
  "The idea's ridiculous! The old boy is seventy-six if he's a day, and he's
  the most rumbustiously straight man I know."</p>

  <p>"That crazy fellow in the court asked you to find out what's wrong with
  him, didn't he?" asked Michael quietly.</p>

  <p>Mason rubbed his bald head.</p>

  <p>"There are too many crazy people giving me theories," he said pointedly.
  "No, I don't mean you, Michael."</p>

  <p>"What about asking the doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Marford? Must I tell him I've pulled him out of bed to confirm what a
  lunatic has said about one of his patients? And would he tell? That's the one
  thing you can't compel a doctor to do unless you get him into the witness
  stand, and even then the Medical Association raise a hullabaloo if a lawyer
  goes a little too far."</p>

  <p>"Wake him up on some other excuse," suggested Michael. "After all, he may
  be able to help us with Rudd."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mason thrust his hands more deeply into his pockets and rattled his
  loose change irritably.</p>

  <p>"He certainly limped, if the woman witness was telling the truth. And now
  I come to remember it, White Face has always been a limper. That was one of
  the first descriptions circulated. He used to ride a motor-cycle, you
  remember&mdash;that rather knocks your idea on the head."</p>

  <p>"Motor-cyclists have been seen coming from the scene of a robbery, but
  nobody could swear that those particular cyclists were the robbers," said
  Michael. "The motor-cycle theory is one that everybody has jumped to, that
  after he did his dirty work he made his getaway on a pop-pop! When you come
  to think of it, motor-bikes are the most conspicuous things in London after a
  certain hour. Isn't it more likely that he made his grand exit on the box of
  a taxicab?"</p>

  <p>"Or," said Mason, "is it more likely that a man with a fifty-year record
  for honesty, a man with a bit of money put by, with no relations or friends,
  no vices, a man who never goes out, has never done a dishonest thing in his
  life, should suddenly turn crook? And listen, Michael! You've been a witness
  to a White Face raid and you've read about the others. What has invariably
  happened? He's come into the restaurant and he's said two words&mdash;what
  are those words?"</p>

  <p>"'Bail up,'" said Michael.</p>

  <p>Mason nodded vehemently.</p>

  <p>"Exactly&mdash;'bail up'! It was an expression of the old Australian
  bushrangers. It's still used by the hold-up men in Australia. Gregory's never
  been out of London in his life, except to drive a drunken fare into the
  country. The only knowledge he has of the word 'bail' is that it's something
  to do with getting a man out of a police station after he's pinched. I'll
  tell you who White Face is&mdash;Tommy Furse."</p>

  <p>"And who in hell is Tommy Furse?" asked Michael, in surprise.</p>

  <p>"You shall have the story when it's properly cooked&mdash;at present the
  oven is just heating up."</p>

  <p>He got up quickly from his chair.</p>

  <p>"I'll call the doctor and tell him I want to come round and see him. Or
  Bray can do it."</p>

  <p>He opened the door, shouted for the inspector, and when he came gave him
  instructions.</p>

  <p>"Tell him I'm very worried about Dr. Rudd and I would like to consult
  him."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," he added, when Bray had gone, "I'm not feeling too
  happy about Rudd, though what Dr. Marford can tell me I don't know."</p>

  <p>"May I come?"</p>

  <p>"You can come, but you'd better stay outside. I can't very well introduce
  you into an official inquiry."</p>

  <p>"Anyway, he doesn't like me very much," said Michael, with a recollection
  of Dr. Marford's former coldness.</p>

  <p>When the superintendent reached the surgery he found Dr. Marford dressed.
  He had not been to bed that night, had only returned from a patient a few
  minutes before the 'phone message came through.</p>

  <p>"A boy or a girl?" asked Mr. Mason blandly.</p>

  <p>"In this event it was both," said the doctor.</p>

  <p>He very much disliked discussing his cases, as Bray, who knew him better
  than Mason, was well aware.</p>

  <p>"I'm not worried at all about Dr. Rudd. I didn't like to say so before,
  for fear you might think I was saying something disparaging of him. By the
  way, I called in at the infirmary to see that woman, but as she seemed to be
  sleeping the house surgeon thought I'd better not see her."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Weston?"</p>

  <p>Marford nodded.</p>

  <p>"When will she be fit to make a statement?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow&mdash;this morning, I should think."</p>

  <p>He took a whisky bottle from a cupboard and put it with a siphon on the
  table.</p>

  <p>"This is all I can offer you. I keep it exclusively for my visitors.
  Personally, I never drink after ten o'clock in the evening."</p>

  <p>He had no suggestions to offer with regard to Rudd.</p>

  <p>"He'll turn up," he said confidentially, "and I prophesy that he'll turn
  up with a headache and be quite incapable of transacting any kind of business
  for a day or two."</p>

  <p>"What on earth do you think he's done?" asked Mason, and the doctor
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"I would rather not say."</p>

  <p>"You'd rather not say things about quite a lot of people, Doctor." Mason
  helped himself to some whisky and splashed in soda.</p>

  <p>"They tell me you could hang half Gallows Court and send the other half to
  prison for the term of their natural lives?"</p>

  <p>"If I could, I should do it," said Marford. "Believe me, I have no
  sympathy with that ghastly crowd&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Except Gregory Wicks?" suggested Mason, and a shadow passed over the
  doctor's face.</p>

  <p>"Except Gregory Wicks," he said slowly.</p>

  <p>"Gregory Wicks," began Bray, "is one of the nicest people living in this
  area&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I'm sure the doctor will agree," said Mason. "But why not
  Gregory Wicks?"</p>

  <p>"For many reasons," replied Marford. "He's a good fellow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with him? You attend him, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Marford smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"I attend a good many people, but I never say what is the matter with
  them, even to entertain eminent police officers."</p>

  <p>"There's something the matter with him, isn't there?" insisted Mason, and
  Marford nodded.</p>

  <p>"Anno Domini! You can't get to the age of seventy-six without running a
  little threadbare. There are worn spots in men of that age, certain
  weaknesses, peculiar mental and physical failings which no doctor can patch.
  It's amazing to me that he can do what he does at his age. I've never seen
  him really sick or sorry&mdash;he has certainly got the loudest voice in
  Tidal Basin; and I can testify, for I attended the victim, that he can still
  deliver a blow that would knock out the average pugilist. Why are you
  interested?"</p>

  <p>He stepped back from Mason and surveyed him with a troubled face.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, Mr. Mason," he said slowly, "I've got an instinctive idea
  that you've come here not to talk about Mr. Rudd but to talk about this old
  taxi-driver. There is a half-witted man who lives in the court, whose name I
  forget&mdash;he used to be a shoeblack&mdash;who has an obsession about
  Gregory. Every time I go into the court he catches my arm and asks me what is
  wrong with Gregory Wicks&mdash;I wonder if he's been asking you the same
  thing?"</p>

  <p>Mason was momentarily embarrassed. It did not add to his self-esteem that
  he should have been detected acting as a lunatic's mouthpiece.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," he said, and laughed awkwardly. "I've heard the man &mdash;in
  fact, he's asked me the same question. But of course I shouldn't be stupid
  enough to come round in the middle of the night to pass on a crazy inquiry.
  I'm interested in the old boy."</p>

  <p>The doctor was behind his desk, leaning down on his outstretched arms,
  looking terribly tired. Mason found himself being thankful that he had not
  been born in so favourable a position that his parents could afford to
  educate him as a doctor.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to ask the old man in the morning. I'm very sorry; I'd like
  to oblige you, Mr. Mason. It isn't entirely a question of professional
  secrecy&mdash;I certainly wouldn't let that stand in my way with a police
  officer who was investigating a very serious crime&mdash;though what poor old
  Gregory's got to do with it I can't imagine. But I owe Gregory something more
  than perfunctory loyalty. He's by way of being a crony of mine, and I'm
  afraid you'll have to ask him yourself to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"He has something the matter with his face, hasn't he?"</p>

  <p>Marford hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said; "you could describe it that way."</p>

  <p>And then he raised his eyes slowly to Mason.</p>

  <p>"You will not suggest"&mdash;his lips twitched&mdash;"that the old man is
  your White Face?"</p>

  <p>"I'm suggesting nothing of the sort," said Mason hastily and
  reproachfully. "Of course I'm not! I'm merely curious. That crazy fellow's
  got on my nerves&mdash;I'll admit it. Certainly, I'll ask Gregory himself in
  the morning. I'd ask him to-night if it wasn't for disturbing that mackerel
  who's been sleeping on Gregory's doorstep ever since midnight."</p>

  <p>"Is it a very red-nosed man?" asked Bray, interested. "If it is, he's
  often there. I've seen him myself. I very often go through Gallows Court
  alone&mdash;more or less alone. A drunken-looking man with a red
  nose&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I never inspected his nose," said Mason icily. "It probably went red
  through sticking it into other people's investigations."</p>

  <p>"Very likely," said Mr. Bray, and Shale could only marvel at his clouded
  intelligence.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe every man who wears a lint mask is a criminal?" Marford
  asked quietly. "Of course you don't: you're too sensible. Any more than you
  believe that all Chinamen are wicked. I ask you this,"&mdash;he spoke very
  slowly&mdash;"because the man of whom you spoke earlier this evening is
  coming"&mdash;he looked at his watch&mdash;"in less than ten minutes."</p>

  <p>"White Face?" said Mason in amazement.</p>

  <p>"He telephoned me just before you came."</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Dr. Marford"&mdash;Bray could not be repressed&mdash;"how is
  this White Face man dressed when you see him?"</p>

  <p>Marford considered a moment.</p>

  <p>"He usually wears a very long coat reaching almost to his heels, and a
  soft dark hat."</p>

  <p>"Black?" asked Bray eagerly.</p>

  <p>"It may be. I've never really noticed."</p>

  <p>"Why is he coming this morning?" asked Mason.</p>

  <p>"He said he would have come earlier in the night, but the streets were
  full of policemen. I'm telling you what he told me. It doesn't sound too good
  of any man that he's afraid of the police. But anyone super-sensitive as this
  fellow is, might very easily shrink from being seen."</p>

  <p>"He telephoned you from where?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure. It certainly wasn't our local exchange, because the calls
  we get through on the local exchange are always indicated by continuous
  ringing, and these signals came at intervals."</p>

  <p>He walked to the big window, drew aside the blind and looked out.</p>

  <p>"There's somebody out there," he said. "Is it a police officer? No, it
  isn't, I see. It's the reporter, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Ask him to come in."</p>

  <p>Mason nodded to his subordinate, and Sergeant Shale went out to admit the
  reporter.</p>

  <p>"If I could stop you getting a big beat I would, Michael, but this matter
  isn't entirely in my hands. You'll probably have to use your well-known
  discretion&mdash;I think I can trust you to keep out of your paper just what
  I want you to keep out."</p>

  <p>"The idea being?" asked Michael.</p>

  <p>"White Face," said Mr. Bray, and coughed when he caught his superior's
  chilly eye.</p>

  <p>"As that active and discreet officer said, it's somebody with a white
  face; a man who's been seen in this neighbourhood, and probably in other
  neighbourhoods&mdash;I think you met him at the Howdah Club. And he's due
  here almost at once. I don't suppose he wants to see a lot of people
  here"&mdash;he addressed Marford&mdash;"but you realise I'll have to ask him
  to give an account of himself."</p>

  <p>The doctor, who was arranging an instrument that looked like a huge
  aluminium funnel, nodded his agreement.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, he's very shy, but if I am to betray anybody in the
  interests of justice I might as well betray him. It isn't very admirable and
  I can't say that I'm very proud of myself."</p>

  <p>He brought the lamp nearer to his desk and turned the switch, and Mason
  saw a circle of green light appear on the floor. The shadows which the other
  lights cast ran through the circle redly. Marford turned off the lamp and
  explained that the current came, not from the main electric supply, but from
  an accumulator.</p>

  <p>"I warn you," he said, "that this man may refuse to enter the surgery. It
  took me a long while to persuade him the last time he was here."</p>

  <p>"Which way does he come?"</p>

  <p>"Through the yard and up that passage to that door." He pointed to the
  door near the medicine cupboard. "He gives me a signal&mdash;two long rings
  and two short ones; that was my own arrangement on account of his incurable
  shyness. I shall never get him in if he sees any of you."</p>

  <p>Mason tried the door; it was locked. The telephone bell rang at a moment
  when all nerves were tense. Marford sat on the desk and took up the
  instrument.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's here," he said. "It is Dr. Marford speaking... better, is she?
  I'm glad of that... Certainly."</p>

  <p>He handed the instrument to Mason.</p>

  <p>"The woman Weston is quite conscious and wants to come to the station to
  see you."</p>

  <p>Mason listened, giving monosyllabic interruptions. He put up the receiver
  and looked very thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"She wants to come to the station. It was Elk&mdash;I thought I recognised
  the voice. I wonder if I could get him here in time," said Mason
  thoughtfully. "He'd be very much interested to meet White Face &mdash;he's
  met him once this evening."</p>

  <p>"There may be time&mdash;" began Marford.</p>

  <p>A bell in the room rang shrilly and long, rang again, then came two short
  rings. The men looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"That is your White Face, is it?"</p>

  <p>Mason's voice was husky. His hand dropped mechanically to his pocket, and
  Bray was satisfied now: the rumour that Mason always carried a gun was
  true.</p>

  <p>Michael Quigley, a silent participator, felt a little shiver run down his
  spine as Mason made a gesture to his two subordinates.</p>

  <p>"Behind those curtains, you two fellows. Michael, you'd better go out into
  the front hall. I'll get behind the desk if you don't mind."</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to do?" asked Marford, as he took a key from his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"Let him in, that's all. I'll see that he doesn't get out again," said
  Mason. "You can help us by shutting and locking the door on him."</p>

  <p>Marford nodded. He turned the key and pulled open the door slowly.
  Watching him from the cover of the desk, Mason saw him smile.</p>

  <p>"Good evening," he said. "Won't you come in?" He went a little out of
  sight and they heard the rumble of a voice saying something which was
  indistinguishable. It might have been a voice that spoke behind a muffling
  mask.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," they heard Marford say, "I have never promised you that
  I can be absolutely alone, but you have nothing to fear&mdash;come
  along."</p>

  <p>He disappeared from view into the passage and Mason held his breath. Then
  suddenly the door slammed; there was the sound of a bolt being drawn, and in
  another second:</p>

  <p>"Help!" It was Marford's voice. "Mason... Mason! For God's sake!"</p>

  <p>Then came an unearthly scream that turned the hearers' blood cold.</p>

  <p>Mason was on his feet instantly. He was half-way to the door when the
  lights of the room went out. From the passage came the faint sound of a
  struggle.</p>

  <p>"Bray! Go to the front door, quick! Go with him, Shale!"</p>

  <p>They came to the front door to find it was locked from the inside and did
  not yield to their frantic tugging. Mason remembered that the doctor had told
  him he kept that part of the premises which contained the surgery locked and
  double-locked, and that he invariably used the back door himself.</p>

  <p>They stumbled back through the darkness, and as Mason picked up a chair
  and sent it smashing a the panel, a ray from Bray's torch glittered on the
  lamp.</p>

  <p>"This works."</p>

  <p>He fumbled for the switch and found it, and the ghostly green circle
  appeared on the floor. It gave them enough light to work by. Within a few
  moments two panels were gone. Bray, the taller, reached through, found the
  bolt and drew it. There was another at the bottom, and it was some minutes
  before the third panel was broken and enabled them to reach this.</p>

  <p>Bray was the first in the passage. It was empty. The door at the end stood
  wide open. He ran out into the yard&mdash;there was nobody in sight.</p>

  <p>"There's blood here," he said. "I can't see Marford. Can you bring the
  lamp out?"</p>

  <p>Shale examined the flex: there was enough to carry the ray lamp into the
  corridor. It revealed nothing except patches of something red and shining on
  the floor and walls. The doctor and his assailant had vanished.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TO the man in the yard outside came the sound of splintering
  panels. White Face had no need to crank up his machine: the taxi engine was
  running softly. He pulled open the two gates and took a look inside the cab.
  On the floor was a huddled figure.</p>

  <p>"Doctor," said White Face pleasantly, "I'm afraid I shall have to take you
  for an uncomfortable journey."</p>

  <p>He could have left him behind for the detectives to find, but it was most
  undesirable that this medical practitioner should tell his experience; for he
  had seen White Face without his mask.</p>

  <p>The car ran swiftly into the street. As he passed he thought he could hear
  somebody trying to get out of the front door. He passed a policeman on the
  corner of the street; the man shouted out to him, "Good night, Gregory."
  White Face smiled to himself.</p>

  <p>The hands which gripped the wheel were wet and stained with the red liquid
  which he had poured from a bottle on to the floor and walls of the passage.
  He hoped it would look like blood, would at least throw his pursuers off the
  track until the morning.</p>

  <p>He hadn't too much time. Mentally he calculated how long it would take
  Mason to telephone a description of the cab to Scotland Yard, and just how
  much longer time would be wasted whilst the description was being circulated
  through London. He gave himself a good half-hour, providing he kept to the
  outskirts. So he made his way northward, and in half an hour had reached the
  outskirts of Epping Forest. It was certain that the Yard would telephone to
  the outlying stations the number of the cab, and that made it imperative that
  he should keep to the secondary roads and avoid those key points where the
  Essex police patrols could establish a barrage.</p>

  <p>With any luck he could reach the little farm undetected. It lay between
  Epping and Chelmsford, not a long journey if he had dared the direct
  route.</p>

  <p>He came at last to a place where an uninviting country lane ran off at
  right angles to the road, and turned his car down this. He had to move with
  the greatest caution, for he had extinguished his lamps. The road was uneven,
  but not quite so bad as the cart track into which he guided the taxi. Here he
  had to move very carefully. The only thing that concerned him was whether the
  noise of the car in low gear would attract the attention of an inquisitive
  policeman, but apparently it had not.</p>

  <p>Without any knowledge of the time, he could make a rough guess
  &mdash;thought it must be four o'clock. There was no sign of dawn in the
  sky.</p>

  <p>He came at last to an old barn, which was built by the side of a squat and
  shapeless building, and, stopping the cab without stopping the engine, he got
  down, opened the cab door and, lifting out the unconscious doctor, laid him
  on the grass. Then he backed the machine into the barn and, closing the big
  gate of it, went back to open the door of the house. This done, he returned
  to the place where he had left the doctor and half carried, half dragged him
  into the passage.</p>

  <p>Except for a few ugly, dilapidated articles which the previous owner had
  not thought it worthwhile to move, the house was unfurnished. There was a
  dingy carpet running the length of the hall, and in the room to where White
  Face carried his burden, an old sofa to which he hoisted the doctor. He stood
  for some time looking at his prisoner. "It was a great mistake for you to try
  to set the police on me, and I hope no harm comes to you," he said.</p>

  <p>Lately White Face had acquired the habit of talking aloud.</p>

  <p>He finished his examination of the unconscious man, then went out to the
  barn, and presently came back with a small bottle of champagne and a box of
  biscuits: emergency rations which he kept in a box under the cab seat.</p>

  <p>The taxi was of no more use to him. He must make his way across country to
  Harwich by another means. And those means were ready to his hand. He had
  compiled from week to week, with scrupulous care, a list of motor excursions
  out of London. There was one leaving in the morning from Forest Gate to
  Felixstowe, and he had already decided that this was the route he would take.
  He would not be noticed in an excursion crowd.</p>

  <p>The doctor was a difficulty. Almost he wished he had not brought him; but
  he was too dangerous to leave.</p>

  <p>White Face drank his wine out of an old cup he found in the kitchen,
  poured out another cup and took it back to where he had left his charge.
  Placing the lamp which he carried on the table, and by the side of this the
  cup, White Face sat on the edge of the bed and waited. Presently he saw the
  doctor's eyes flicker; they opened, looked wonderingly round the room and
  fixed themselves finally upon the man who was sitting on the bed.</p>

  <p>"Where is this place?" he spoke huskily.</p>

  <p>"This place is a little farm near Romford," said the other calmly. "And
  may I tell you what your friend Mason has already guessed&mdash;that I am
  White Face."</p>

  <p>The doctor looked at him incredulously. "You?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"Weird, isn't it? But I think you guessed it yourself and were prepared to
  tell your friends of Scotland Yard. I am not going to chloroform you or drug
  you again or do any of the things which I might do. Unless I am greatly
  mistaken, you will go to sleep and you will sleep for a very long time; and
  when you wake up you will find your way to the nearest police station. If you
  drive a car, I must tell you there is a taxi in the barn&mdash;I invariably
  use a taxi. My landlord"&mdash;he laughed at the word&mdash;"was Mr. Gregory
  Wicks. I invariably use a taxi&mdash;Gregory Wicks's taxi. That may or may
  not convey something to you, but I rather fancy your mind is incapable of
  grasping important essentials."</p>

  <p>The doctor was staring at him.</p>

  <p>"Turn on your side," commanded White Face, and was obeyed instantly.
  "Close your eyes."</p>

  <p>He waited a few minutes until the drugged man was asleep, and then he went
  out, taking the lamp with him. He made another journey to the garage, brought
  in a suitcase and laid out such toilet articles as he required.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MASON had found the governing light switch and brought on
  all the lights in Marford's house. Bray, who had searched the yard, came back
  with his report.</p>

  <p>"There's blood everywhere," he said. "Look at that!" He pointed to an
  uneven smudge near the door. "They carried him out this way."</p>

  <p>"Is there any other way he could have been carried out?" snapped
  Mason.</p>

  <p>In the courtyard the gates were wide open, and so were the doors of the
  empty garage. Gregory Wick's taxicab had gone. When they came out to the
  street they had heard the faint, dying whine of it as it sped westwards.</p>

  <p>"They've got him in the cab," said Bray incoherently. "There must have
  been two or three of them."</p>

  <p>"Why not four or five?" snarled Mason, "Or six or seven?"</p>

  <p>"I only want to say," began the aggrieved inspector, "that one man
  couldn't have outed him and lifted him. I'd better call up assistance."</p>

  <p>The police whistle was half-way to his mouth when Mason knocked it out of
  his hand.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with the telephone?" he asked fiercely. "I want to know
  who's awake in this neighbourhood, and I don't want any excuse for their
  being awake, either! Call every man you can lay your hands on. The reserves
  will be in by now."</p>

  <p>When Bray had gone, the superintendent made a quick search of the yard.
  There was an open pit surrounded by a low fencing. He struck a match, drew
  his own lamp from his pocket and cast the rays down. A long way below the
  surface of the ground he saw the glint of water. A well. How deep was it?
  There was something there, too, something that looked like a sack. And then
  he heard a voice behind him. "Found the well?"</p>

  <p>He looked round; it was Elk, a ghostly figure, with his white-bandaged
  head. "Did you know there was a well here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the winch is above your head&mdash;handle on the wall."</p>

  <p>Looking up, Mason saw an iron bracket. "Something down there?" asked Elk,
  and peered curiously. "Gregory's cab's gone, of course. I guessed something
  was happening and came round."</p>

  <p>The two men went up to the empty garage and made a search. There was
  nothing there except a few tools, a spare tyre or two and a dozen tins of
  petrol. They picked up the blood trail in the garage. Mason looked at these
  ominous stains and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"All my ideas have gone west," he said in despair.</p>

  <p>"Mine have stayed strictly put, working for the good of humanity," said
  Elk. "White Face, wasn't it? And he's kidnapped the doctor&mdash;that
  fellow's got a nerve!"</p>

  <p>They heard Michael's step and looked round. "Well, are you going to
  interview Gregory?" he asked. "Gregory&mdash;I presume he's with his
  cab."</p>

  <p>"Let's see," said Michael.</p>

  <p>They discovered that the door leading into Gallows Court was fastened with
  a spring lock and offered no difficulty. Elk examined this door carefully and
  grunted.</p>

  <p>"As full of clues as a milkshop," he said.</p>

  <p>They walked quickly down the court and came to the doorway of No. 9. The
  sleeper still snored; the tin remained balanced on his knee.</p>

  <p>"Whoever put that tin there were helping the police a lot," said Mason.
  "It'd break their hearts to know it, but it's a fact."</p>

  <p>He knocked heavily at the door, but there was no answer. After a little
  while he knocked again-still no reply.</p>

  <p>"He must have gone out."</p>

  <p>Michael shook his head emphatically.</p>

  <p>"How could he go in or out with that man sitting there? He must have moved
  him."</p>

  <p>The sleeper was now aroused; the tin fell noisily from his knee as he
  stood up, groaning, and Bray recognised him as a famous local tippler. He had
  been there, he said, since about&mdash;he didn't know the time; he thought it
  was about half an hour after the public-houses had closed. He could not
  remember anybody passing, cither going in or out. Mason knocked again.</p>

  <p>Gallows Court was alive now&mdash;alive with dark shapes that had melted
  out of the walls, silent things that just looked and gave no evidence of
  their humanness. Curious watchers, eager to see somebody, something happen.
  If they had chatted amongst themselves Michael could have borne their
  presence, but they were terribly silent, edging nearer and nearer.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly the upper window of No. 9 was raised creakily.</p>

  <p>"Who's that?"</p>

  <p>It was old Gregory Wicks's strident voice, unmistakably so.</p>

  <p>"I want to see you, Gregory."</p>

  <p>"Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"Superintendent Mason. You remember me?"</p>

  <p>The old man cogitated.</p>

  <p>"I don't know no Superintendent Mason. There used to be a young feller
  called Sergeant Mason a few years ago."</p>

  <p>"A good few, Gregory," said Mason with a chuckle. "I'm Sergeant Mason.
  Come down and let us in."</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" asked the old man cautiously.</p>

  <p>"I want to have a talk with you."</p>

  <p>The man above hesitated, but after a while he put down the window and
  Mason heard his feet descending the stairs. The door opened noisily.</p>

  <p>"Come on up to my room," he said.</p>

  <p>There was no light in the house save the lamp which the police brought,
  nor in his little sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"Come in and sit down. Here's a chair, Sergeant&mdash;Superintendent, eh?
  Gosh! Time goes on!"</p>

  <p>"Haven't you got a lamp?"</p>

  <p>The question seemed to embarrass the old man.</p>

  <p>"Lamp? Well, yes, I've got a lamp somewhere. You'll find it in the
  kitchen, mister. There are three of you, ain't there? My eyes are not as good
  as they used to be, but I sort of heard three lots of feet on the stairs
  besides mine."</p>

  <p>It was Michael who went downstairs and found the lamp half filled with
  oil. He lit it, fixed the glass chimney and carried it carefully up the
  stairs into the room where the three men were. And then, to Mason's surprise,
  he said:</p>

  <p>"I couldn't find your lamp anywhere, Mr. Wicks."</p>

  <p>This in face of the fairly bright light he carried in his hand. The old
  man smiled.</p>

  <p>"What do you call that you've brought into the room?" he said. "Put it on
  the table, young man, and don't try to take liberties with me."</p>

  <p>The look of chagrin in Michael's face brought joy to Superintendent
  Mason's heart.</p>

  <p>"Now sit down, everybody. What do you want to know?"</p>

  <p>"Have you been out to-night, Gregory?" Mason asked.</p>

  <p>Gregory felt his scrubby chin.</p>

  <p>"For a little while," he said cautiously. "I always pop up to the West
  End. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Does anybody else drive your cab?"</p>

  <p>"I've let it out before now," said Gregory. "I'm not so young as I was,
  and an owner-driver has got to live, and he can only live if he works his
  machine all the time."</p>

  <p>"Who takes your car out?"</p>

  <p>The old man did not answer, and Mason repeated the question.</p>

  <p>"Well... my lodger takes it out."</p>

  <p>"The man who lives downstairs?"</p>

  <p>"That's right, Sergeant&mdash;I mean, Superintendent! Bless me life, fancy
  you being a superintendent! I remember you getting your first stripe."</p>

  <p>Mason patted him gently on the knee.</p>

  <p>"Of course you do. And I remember summonsing you for using abusive
  language and the magistrate dismissing the charge."</p>

  <p>Gregory gurgled with laughter at the recollection.</p>

  <p>"I was always a hard one to get the better of," he said smugly.</p>

  <p>"Where is your lodger now?"</p>

  <p>Again the hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Out, I suppose. He usually goes out at night. Rather a nice young feller.
  Very quiet. He's about thirty-five, and he's had a lot of trouble: that's all
  I know about him." Then, in sudden alarm: "He's not been in trouble
  again?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's the kind of trouble, is it?" said Mason. "Gregory, where is
  your badge?"</p>

  <p>Now, a cabman's badge is an almost sacred thing. It is to the driver what
  marriage lines are to a woman. The effect of the question on the old man was
  extraordinary. He fidgeted in his chair and rubbed his chin.</p>

  <p>"I've put it away somewhere," he said lamely.</p>

  <p>"Gregory, where is your badge? If you've been out to-night, you must have
  been wearing it," said Mason. "As a matter of fact, you haven't been out
  to-night; you haven't been out any night for months; you know that, old
  pal."</p>

  <p>Again he pressed the old man's knee affectionately, and this time his
  sympathy was genuine.</p>

  <p>"You know why you haven't been out. The doctor knows."</p>

  <p>"He hasn't told?" said Gregory quickly.</p>

  <p>"No, I've told myself. You knew there was a lamp came in the room because
  you could smell it, but you couldn't see it, Gregory&mdash;only dimly. Isn't
  that true?"</p>

  <p>The old man shrank back.</p>

  <p>"I've been a licensed cabman for fifty-five years, Mr. Mason," he
  pleaded.</p>

  <p>"I know. I hope you'll be a licensed cabman all the days of your life.
  Only you mustn't drive cabs, Gregory&mdash;when you're blind!"</p>

  <p>He saw the old man wince, and cursed himself for his brutality.</p>

  <p>"I'm not exactly blind, but I can't see very well."</p>

  <p>The blustering Gregory Wicks had suddenly become an oddly pathetic
  figure.</p>

  <p>"My eyes are not what they were, Mr. Mason, but I never like to admit it.
  I've had my licence and badge all these years, and naturally I didn't want to
  part with it; so when this young lodger of mine, who's been in trouble and
  couldn't get a licence, said he'd like to take out the cab,
  I&mdash;well&mdash;I lent him my badge. That's an offence, I know, but I'm
  willing to take my medicine."</p>

  <p>"Then you've never seen your lodger?"</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't seen him; I've heard him. He comes in sometimes; I hear him
  moving about; and he pays me regularly."</p>

  <p>"How do you know he's thirty-five, and a nice young man who's going to be
  married?"</p>

  <p>"I heard he was&mdash;a friend of mine told me."</p>

  <p>They left him bemoaning the loss of the thing which was more precious to
  him than any other possession&mdash;the stamped licence that had been issued
  every one of the fifty-five years of his active life, and which might never
  be issued again. Mason went downstairs and tried the door of the lower room.
  The lock was not difficult to pick&mdash;did not, if they had known, require
  picking at all, for the key of the upstairs room fitted both doors. In five
  minutes it swung open and Mason went in, followed by Bray, who carried the
  oil lamp.</p>

  <p>There was a bed in one corner, but evidently it had not been slept in for
  a long time: the blankets were folded, the pillow was without cover. The
  floor had a large square of carpet in the centre, and that, with a table, a
  chair, and a square mirror over the fireplace, seemed all that the room
  contained, until Elk began to test the mirror, and found that it hid a
  roughly hewn hole in the wall, large enough to take a heavy steel box.</p>

  <p>"This will tell us something," said Mason.</p>

  <p>The lid opened squeakily, and he stared down into the interior at what it
  contained.</p>

  <p>It was a short, stout knife, the blade stained and smeared red. Carefully
  he picked it out and as carefully laid it on the bare table.</p>

  <p>"Here is the knife that killed Donald Bateman," he said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ONLY one man in the court had ever seen Gregory's lodger, or
  would admit they had seen him. At the very hint of an inquiry the crowd that
  filled the court melted back into the walls again; only the crazy, nameless
  man remained.</p>

  <p>"Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?" he almost screamed when he caught
  sight of Mason. "You and the reporter fellow&mdash;what's wrong with Gregory,
  eh? I knew!" He tapped his nose. "I'll bet the doctor knew, but he wouldn't
  squeak. Here!" He detained Mason. "Is it true that they got the doctor?...
  Somebody'll be murdered if they touch him! Everybody in Gallows Court will go
  and find the man and bring him in here and put him down into a cellar, and
  put clay in his mouth and tear little bits off him till he dies!"</p>

  <p>The awful face grinned up at the superintendent.</p>

  <p>"In which case," said Mason, "I shall come and do a bit of pinching
  myself, and somebody else will die. No, I don't know who has taken the
  doctor."</p>

  <p>"I heard him&mdash;shouting, screaming something awful. And then the cab
  went out," whispered the man. "If we'd known it was the doctor we'd have been
  after 'em."</p>

  <p>"What is this lodger like?"</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"A tall feller&mdash;that's all I know. Seen him once or twice go in and
  out, generally at night; but I've never seen him any closer than that. He
  didn't sleep there&mdash;old Gregory thought he did, but he didn't."</p>

  <p>This was so near to the conclusion that Mason formed that he was inclined
  to listen to other opinions with respect, but Shoey&mdash;as they called
  him&mdash;said no more.</p>

  <p>There was one good quality about Inspector Bray: he was an excellent
  telephonist. Before Mason left the surgery, Scotland Yard knew all about a
  taxicab No. 93458&mdash;its colour, its appearance generally and the
  direction it had taken. And Scotland Yard knew all about the missing Dr.
  Marford and the chauffeur who lived with old Gregory Wicks.</p>

  <p>That busy printing press at the Yard worked furiously to carry the news to
  the outermost beat, and the early workers straggling into the City saw police
  cyclists disregarding all speed rules.</p>

  <p>Lorna Weston sat in the infirmary hall waiting for the ambulance which was
  to take her to the police station. A pallid, shaken woman, her eyes weary and
  heavy, she barely noticed or heard the laborious platitudes of Police
  Constable Hartford, who sat by her side&mdash;all the more laborious because
  he had decided that her condition was due to excessive indulgence in alcohol,
  and had set himself the task of opening her eyes to the evil that men (and
  women) put in their mouths to steal away their brains.</p>

  <p>One of the policemen who came with the ambulance gave a fragmentary and
  generally inaccurate resume of what had happened to Dr. Marford. P.C.
  Hartford clicked his lips unhappily.</p>

  <p>"It only shows, Mrs. Weston, what drink will do to a man," he said. "They
  were probably all drinking together up at the doctor's surgery, and naturally
  something happened. It's never too late to turn. Take me: five years ago
  there wasn't a man who loved a glass of beer more than myself. I used to call
  myself a moderate drinker, but was I? No man who drinks can be a moderate
  drinker. Then one day I was induced to take the pledge, and look at me
  to-day!"</p>

  <p>She did not look at him. She hardly heard him. If she had looked, she
  would have realised that if there had been any improvement in P.C. Hartford's
  appearance, he must have looked very dreadful in his moderately drinking
  days. But she heard nothing except a buzz of voices that had been going on
  all night&mdash;whispering, buzzing voices that came from another planet; and
  there was a little pain in her left arm which irritated her; and through all
  her confusion of mind and dread, formless reality which could not be reduced
  to any dimensions or advanced into clear perspective.</p>

  <p>When she spoke it was mechanically to repeat:</p>

  <p>"I want to see the Chief of Police. I must see the Chief of Police."</p>

  <p>She repeated this monotonously. Part of the mechanism of her reason was
  working; some tremendous motive power impelled a demand of which she was not
  conscious. She had little flashes of complete understanding; knew she was
  sitting on a hard form in a long and dimly-lit corridor, with bare,
  discoloured walls. In the next second she was sitting in an arm-chair in a
  small room, which was so light that it hurt her eyes; and a different lot of
  people were around her.</p>

  <p>"Why did the infirmary people let her go?" asked Mason, in despair.</p>

  <p>"I want to see the Chief of Police," she said. "I want to make a
  statement."</p>

  <p>"So you've told me a dozen times, my dear," said Mason, patting her hand.
  "Now wake up. You know where you are&mdash;I'm Superintendent Mason."</p>

  <p>She looked at him searchingly and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Where's the matron?" asked Mason. "Oh, here you are, Miss Leverett. Let
  her lie down; give her some coffee. Where's that damned&mdash;oh, there you
  are, Bray! Is there any report?"</p>

  <p>"None, sir," said the inspector. And then, painfully: "I don't think I can
  stand much more, sir. I shall have to go to sleep. After all, I'm only
  human."</p>

  <p>"You're not human at all"&mdash;Mason was distinctly offensive
  &mdash;"you're a policeman. You haven't been awake twenty-four hours, and
  you'll certainly be awake another twenty-four; the first forty-eight hours
  are the worst."</p>

  <p>"My own belief is," said Bray, "that this fellow drove the cab straight
  into the Thames&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I'm sure he did," said Mason soothingly, "or into the British
  Museum, possibly. You might put an inquiry through."</p>

  <p>Inspector Bray considered this.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think they'd go to the British Museum, sir&mdash;" he
  began.</p>

  <p>Mason pointed to the door. He felt that another ten minutes of Inspector
  Bray would reduce him to a state of imbecility.</p>

  <p>He returned to the inspector's room, now littered with a medley of
  articles which had been removed from the "lodger's" home. There were one or
  two very important documents which he had found in a tin case, which had been
  half filled with platinum settings. Searching the box he found tweezers, awls
  and instruments of the jeweller's art by the dozen. White Face had himself
  removed the stones from their settings&mdash;the wonder is that he had not
  disposed of the platinum. He must have felt himself perfectly safe under the
  aegis of old Gregory, whose very honesty was the lodger's best
  credential.</p>

  <p>A diligent search had been made for evidence of firearms, and as a matter
  of precaution, to the circulation of the description of the wanted man had
  been added the warning: "May carry a pistol." But there was no proof that he
  carried anything of the sort. Neither cartridge nor cartridge box was found
  and, except for the knife, no arms whatsoever.</p>

  <p>In the bottom of the cupboard they had unearthed a cardboard box bearing a
  Lyons label, which was filled with bundles of white cotton gloves, and in
  another part of the room half a dozen squares of twill into which eyeholes
  had been roughly cut. To the edge of each was fastened a strip of whalebone
  and a piece of elastic; the whalebone kept the mask rigid, and the elastic
  obviously fitted over the ears. Except for the eye-holes they might have been
  parts of the hangman's ghastly equipment.</p>

  <p>White Face was well found in all matters pertaining to dress. There were
  two new long black coats, obviously of foreign make, three pairs of rubber
  goloshes, only one pair of which had been used and, most curious of all, a
  dummy automatic pistol. It was the kind that is used in theatres, was made of
  wood, and was a lifelike representation of the real article. Until he had
  picked it up in his hand and had felt its lightness, Mason had been
  absolutely certain that it was the real thing.</p>

  <p>In his own mind he was convinced that White Face had no other weapon and
  that this was the gun he carried on his unlawful occasions, the weapon which
  had cowed crowded restaurants and night clubs, and had reduced porters and
  waiters to trembling jelly.</p>

  <p>Elk was half dozing in the room when Mason entered. "Do you know what I
  think, sir?"</p>

  <p>"You thinking, too?" growled Mason. "All right, I'll buy it."</p>

  <p>"There's one man who is going to get White Face acquitted. You can look at
  it any way you like, but it comes back to the same thing. You couldn't work a
  conviction against him&mdash;if Lamborn sticks to his story."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" Mason's face fell. "Lamborn&mdash;that's the pickpocket. H'm!"</p>

  <p>He pondered on the matter for a long time.</p>

  <p>"You're quite right, Elk," he said at last. "In the face of what that
  dirty little thief has said it would be very difficult to get a verdict. When
  I say 'we couldn't,' we mightn't. It's a shade of odds how the jury would
  take it."</p>

  <p>"The jury," said Mr. Elk oracularly, "is a body or institution which gives
  everybody the benefit of the doubt except the police. Juries don't think;
  they deliberate; juries&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Don't let us get clever," said Mason. He went out through the charge-room
  (where he borrowed a key), down a passage lined on one side with yellow cell
  doors, and stopped before No. 9, pulled back the grating and looked in. Mr.
  Lamborn was lying uneasily on a plank bed, two blankets drawn up over his
  shoulders. He was awake, and at the movement of the grating lifted his
  head.</p>

  <p>"Hallo, Lamborn! Sleeping well?"</p>

  <p>The thief blinked at him, swung his legs clear of the plank and sat
  up.</p>

  <p>"If there's a law in this country, Mason, you're going to get fired out of
  the force for this what I might call outrage!"</p>

  <p>"Invincible soul," said Mason admiringly. He put the key in the lock and
  turned it. "Come out and have some coffee with me?"</p>

  <p>"Poisoned?" asked Lamborn suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"A little strychnine&mdash;nothing serious," said Mason. He conducted his
  prisoner along the corridor, handed over the key of the cell to an amused
  jailer and ushered Lamborn into the little room. At the sight of Elk's
  bandaged head the prisoner brightened visibly.</p>

  <p>"Hallo! Had a coshing?" he asked. "Prayers are answered sometimes! I hope
  you're not seriously injured, Mr. Elk?"</p>

  <p>"He means," interpreted Elk, "that he hopes I'm fatally injured. Sit down,
  you poor, cheap, butter-fingered whizzer."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't like to see you killed&mdash;flowers ain't cheap just
  now."</p>

  <p>Lamborn sat, still smirking, and when the inevitable coffee was brought,
  half filled a cup with sugar. "Got the murderer?" he asked pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"We've got you, Harry," said Mr. Mason in the same tone, and Lamborn
  snorted.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't prove anything against me, except by the well-known perjury
  methods of the London police. I dare say you'll put half a dozen of your tame
  noses in the box and swear me life away, but Gawd's in his heaven!"</p>

  <p>"Where did you learn that bit?" asked Mason curiously.</p>

  <p>Lamborn shrugged his shoulders theatrically.</p>

  <p>"When I'm in stir I only read poetry," he explained. "The book lasts
  longer because you can't understand it."</p>

  <p>He sipped noisily at his coffee, put down the cup with a clatter and
  leaned towards Mason.</p>

  <p>"You haven't got a chance of convicting me. I've been thinking it out in
  the cell."</p>

  <p>Mason smiled pityingly.</p>

  <p>"The moment you start thinking, Harry, you're lost," he said. "It's like
  putting a cow on a tight-rope. You're not built for it. I don't want to
  convict you."</p>

  <p>His tone changed: he was so earnest that he carried conviction even to the
  sceptical hearer.</p>

  <p>"All I wanted then, and all I want now, is that you should tell the truth.
  Have you ever known me to take all this trouble to get a little whizzer a
  couple of months' hard labour? Use your sense, Lamborn! Does a Superintendent
  of Scotland Yard, one of the Big Five, come down here to Tidal Basin and
  waste his night trying to get a conviction against a poor little hook like
  you? It would be like calling on the Navy to kill an earwig!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Lamborn was impressed. The logic was irresistible. He rubbed his chin
  uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Well, it does seem funny," he said.</p>

  <p>"Funny? It's ludicrous! There must have been some reason why I wanted you
  to tell me this, and some reason why I should promise to withdraw the charge
  against you. You're wide, Lamborn&mdash;as wide as any lad in this district.
  Use your common sense and tell me why I should take all this trouble if I
  hadn't something behind it."</p>

  <p>Lamborn avoided his eyes. "It does seem funny," he said again.</p>

  <p>"Then laugh!" growled Elk.</p>

  <p>The man was not listening; he was frowning down at the table, obviously
  making up his mind. He made his decision at last.</p>

  <p>"All right, guv'nor, it's a bet!"</p>

  <p>He put out his hand and Mason gripped it, and that grip was a pledge, an
  oath and a covenant.</p>

  <p>"I dipped him&mdash;yes. I saw him drop and I thought he was soused. I
  went over and I was knocked out to find he was a swell."</p>

  <p>"He was lying on his side, his face away from the lamp, wasn't he?" asked
  Mason.</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"Just tell me what you did&mdash;one moment."</p>

  <p>He raised his voice and called for Bray.</p>

  <p>"Lie down there, Bray." He pointed to the floor. "I want to reconstruct
  Lamborn's petty larceny."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bray looked with some meaning at Elk.</p>

  <p>"Elk can't lie down because of his head," said Mason irritably.</p>

  <p>Bray went down on his knees and stretched himself, and Lamborn stood over
  him.</p>

  <p>"I flicked open his coat&mdash;so. I put my hand in his inside
  pocket&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Left side or right side?" asked Mason.</p>

  <p>"The left side. Then I hooked his clock&mdash;his watch, I mean
  &mdash;with my little finger&mdash;like this."</p>

  <p>His hands moved swiftly. There happened to be a pocket-case in Mr. Bray's
  inside pocket. It also happened to contain the photograph of a very pretty
  girl, which fell on the floor. Bray retrieved it quickly and made a wrathful
  protest.</p>

  <p>"And he's married!" was Elk's shocked murmur.</p>

  <p>Bray went very red.</p>

  <p>"All right, you can get up."</p>

  <p>Taking a sheet of paper out of a drawer, Mason began writing quickly. When
  he had finished he handed the sheet to Lamborn, who read it over and
  eventually affixed his sprawling signature to the statement.</p>

  <p>"Why did you want to know, guv'nor?" he asked. "What's my robbery got to
  do with the murder?"</p>

  <p>Mason smiled.</p>

  <p>"You'll read all about it in one of the evening papers&mdash;I'll try to
  arrange that your photograph's published."</p>

  <p>Elk laughed hollowly.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with his finger-prints?"</p>

  <p>"But why do you want me to tell, Mr. Mason?"</p>

  <p>Mason did not explain.</p>

  <p>"Release this man, Bray. Mark the charge 'withdrawn.' You'll have to
  attend the police court to-morrow morning, but you needn't go into the
  dock."</p>

  <p>"It's the only part of it he knows," said Elk sotto voce.</p>

  <p>Lamborn shook hands forgivingly with the chief and with Elk.</p>

  <p>"One thing, Harry," said Mason, and the released prisoner paused at the
  door. "You'll be given back all your possessions except the jemmy we found in
  your pocket. I didn't tell you, but I was putting a felony charge against you
  in the morning&mdash;'Loitering with intent.' Congratulations!"</p>

  <p>Lamborn made a hurried exit from the police station. Until morning came he
  lay in his bed, puzzling to find a solution of the strange philosophy of
  Superintendent Mason, and could discover no answer that was consistent with
  his knowledge of English police methods.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LAMBORN had hardly left before the superintendent came into
  the charge-room hurriedly and the police reporter heard his name called.</p>

  <p>"Michael, this young lady of yours&mdash;what was she at the clinic?"</p>

  <p>"I believe she acted as Marford's secretary," said Michael, surprised. And
  then, anxiously: "You're not going to see her to-night, are you?"</p>

  <p>Mason was undecided.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think I will. Somebody ought to be told about the doctor &mdash;I
  mean, somebody that matters. Besides, she may give us some very valuable
  help."</p>

  <p>"What help could she give you?" asked Michael suspiciously.</p>

  <p>Mason rolled his head impatiently.</p>

  <p>"If you imagine I'm waking her up in the middle of the night on any old
  excuse for the sake of seeing her in her negligee, you're nattering me. I'm
  out to find all the threads that lead to and from everybody who has played a
  part in this crime," he said. "I want to know who were Marford's friends, who
  were his enemies, and I can think of nobody else who can tell me. She can,
  because she worked with him, and Elk's got an idea that he was sweet on
  her."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" said Michael scornfully. "I don't suppose he ever looked at her
  twice."</p>

  <p>"Once is enough for most men," said Mason. "Are you going to take me up
  and introduce me?"</p>

  <p>When they were huddled up under heavy rugs, for a cold wind made an open
  car a death trap, Michael gave expression to his fears.</p>

  <p>"It's going to be a terrible shock to Janice&mdash;Miss Harman."</p>

  <p>"Call her Janice: it sounds more friendly. Yes, I suppose it is. Marford
  is a fellow who got a lot of affection and sympathy without asking for
  it."</p>

  <p>"His body hasn't been found?"</p>

  <p>Mason shook his head.</p>

  <p>"And it won't be, in spite of the blood. If he'd been dead, White Face
  would have left him, wouldn't he?"</p>

  <p>It was the first encouraging statement Mason had made.</p>

  <p>Bury Street was lifeless when the car drew up before the flat, and it was
  a quarter of an hour before they could arouse the porter. Mason identified
  himself, and the two men climbed up to the first floor.</p>

  <p>The maid was a heavy sleeper; it was Janice who heard the bell and,
  getting into her dressing-gown, opened the door to them. The first person she
  saw was Mason, whom she did not recognise.</p>

  <p>"Don't be worried, Miss Harman. I have a friend of yours with me."</p>

  <p>And then she saw Michael and her alarm was stilled. She took them into the
  drawing-room, went off to wake her maid (there was something old-ladyish
  about Janice, Michael decided), and came back to the drawing-room to learn
  the reason for this visitation.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I've got rather bad news for you. Miss Harman," said
  Mason.</p>

  <p>Invariably he adapted his tone to the subject of his speech, and he was so
  melancholy that she thought he could have come only on one subject, the
  murder of Donald Bateman.</p>

  <p>"I know. Mr. Quigley has told me," she said. "You want to ask me about the
  ring? I gave it&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No. Dr. Marford has disappeared."</p>

  <p>She stared at him.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;he is not hurt?"</p>

  <p>"I hope not," said Mason. "I sincerely hope not."</p>

  <p>It was remarkable to Michael that this man, whom he had regarded as a
  stout, unimaginative and fairly commonplace officer of police, could tell the
  story with such little offence, and suppress so much without losing any of
  the main facts. She listened: the news was less shocking than that of
  Bateman's death, but it left her with a deeper heartache, for Marford was one
  of the ideals which experience and disillusionment had left undisturbed.</p>

  <p>"The trouble is, we know nothing about the doctor or any of his friends,
  and we don't know where to start our inquiries. You were his secretary
  &mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"No, not his secretary," she corrected. "I kept the accounts of the
  clinic, and sometimes of the convalescent home, and I was helping him to get
  Annerford ready&mdash;he has been trying for a year to open a tuberculosis
  institute for the children of Tidal Basin."</p>

  <p>"Where is Annerford?" asked Mason, and she told him and described the work
  which the doctor had set himself to do.</p>

  <p>He had planned greatly, it seemed; had, in one of the drawers of his desk,
  blue prints of a princely building. His appeal to the wealthy public was
  already typewritten, and he had discussed with her many of the details.</p>

  <p>"Now, Miss Harman," said Mason, "you know the people of the clinic. Is
  there anybody there who had a grudge against the doctor, or did he have any
  great friend there&mdash;man or woman?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"There was an elderly nurse and one or two occasional helpers. The staff
  at Eastbourne consisted of a matron and a nurse. He was trying to raise money
  to enlarge these homes," she said; "it was always a source of distress to the
  doctor that the places were understaffed, but they cost an awful lot of
  money."</p>

  <p>"There was nobody at any of these places&mdash;the clinic, the home at
  Eastbourne or at Annerford&mdash;who was in the doctor's confidence?"</p>

  <p>She smiled at this.</p>

  <p>"Not at Annerford. No, I know of nobody. He had no friends." Her lip
  quivered. "You don't think... any harm has come to him?"</p>

  <p>Mason did not reply.</p>

  <p>"Did Bateman have any friends?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She considered the question.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there was a man who came over with him from South Africa, but he
  never mentioned his name. The only other person he seemed to know was Dr.
  Rudd."</p>

  <p>Mason opened his eyes wide. "Dr. Rudd?" he said. "Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. She told him the story of the dinner and Bateman's
  perturbation when he had seen the doctor, resplendent in evening dress.</p>

  <p>"That certainly beats me. Where could he have met Rudd?" said Mason. "All
  gay and beautiful, was he&mdash;the doctor, I mean? Yes, I knew he knocked
  about a little bit in the West End, but I didn't realise&mdash;h'm!"</p>

  <p>He looked down at the carpet for a long time, deep in thought.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said suddenly. "Of course. I understand now. Naturally he didn't
  want to meet Rudd."</p>

  <p>He looked at Michael quizzically.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to stay to breakfast?" he asked, and Michael returned an
  indignant denial.</p>

  <p>"You'd better go down to Tidal Basin and wait for me. I'm only calling at
  Scotland Yard to check up a few dates; I'll be with you in an hour. I'm
  sending a police car back&mdash;you can use that."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">WHITE FACE waited patiently for daylight. He had changed his
  clothes, and the suit he wore now would attract no attention when he lined up
  at Forest Gate for his char-a-banc ticket to the coast. Once or twice he went
  in to see his unwilling companion, and on each occasion found the doctor
  sleeping peacefully.</p>

  <p>From his pocket he took an evening paper which he had not had time to read
  before. There was quite a lot about White Face, of course. He was a star turn
  in those days. Great authors, who catered exclusively for the intelligentsia,
  stepped down from their high pedestals to speculate upon what one called
  "this amusing malefactor." The Howdah affair was still topical. There was a
  revival of the "Devil of Tidal Basin"; some gross plagiarist had attempted to
  revitalise the myth, but it needed Michael Quigley's skilful touch to make it
  live.</p>

  <p>He dropped the paper on to the table, walked out into the open and stood
  listening. From far away he could hear the sound of distant motor-cars, and
  whilst he stood there, he saw a white magnesium rocket, probably a Verey
  light, flame in the air and die. So the police had put on the barrage! He
  knew that signal. A suspected car had been seen, and the white flare was the
  order to the nearest police control to stop and search it. Ingenious people,
  the London police, in their quiet untheatrical way. Very difficult, very
  dangerous to fool with. And yet they were not men of education&mdash;just
  common policemen who had raised themselves out of the rut, established their
  own little hierarchy, and attained by some extraordinary method a complete
  efficiency.</p>

  <p>He did not despise them nor did he fear them. The odds against his
  escaping were twenty to one&mdash;there was enough of the gambler in him to
  fancy his chance.</p>

  <p>No man who was wanted, and whose photograph was procurable, had ever
  escaped from England. Perhaps some did, but the police never admitted the
  exceptions.</p>

  <p>As he came back along the passage he heard a faint voice call from the
  open door of the darkened room.</p>

  <p>"Can I have some water, please?"</p>

  <p>He carried a glass in to the doctor, who drank it and thanked him.</p>

  <p>"You're in considerable danger, my friend. I hope you realise that?" said
  the voice from the sofa weakly.</p>

  <p>"My dear Doctor, I have been in danger for quite a long time&mdash;go to
  sleep, and don't worry about me."</p>

  <p>He waited till he heard the doctor's regular breathing, and then came out,
  closing the door softly behind him.</p>

  <p>Danger! It had no significance for White Face. He feared nothing,
  literally and figuratively feared nothing. He did not regret one act of his
  life; regretted least of all that which had sent Donald Bateman into
  nothingness. Perhaps Walter would not have approved, but then Walter was
  weak&mdash;a daring man, but weak. White Face approved his own deed, which
  approval was more important than self-glorification.</p>

  <p>Poor old Gregory! As for the doctor, he would put water and some kind of
  refreshment ready to his hand. In the morning he would be well enough to
  drive the taxi to the nearest police station.</p>

  <p>Only one regret he had, and that he did not allow his mind to rest upon.
  But to give up life was an easy matter if necessity arose; with life one
  surrendered all aspirations.</p>

  <p>He had finished his shaving, using cream instead of soap and water, when
  he heard a footstep in the passage. The doctor, then, was awake; that was
  unfortunate. He took one step towards the door when it opened. Mason stood
  there; an untidy Mason with his hat on the back of his head and his overcoat
  unfastened.</p>

  <p>"I took the liberty of coming through a back window; most of them are
  open," he said. "I want you, of course."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said White Face. There was no tremor in his voice. "You'll
  find the doctor in the next room. I don't think there's very much the matter
  with him."</p>

  <p>He held out his hands, but Mason shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Handcuffs are old-fashioned. Have you got a gun?"</p>

  <p>White Face shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Then we'll step along," said Mason politely, and guided him by the arm
  into the darkness outside.</p>

  <p>Stopping to despatch his men to look after the doctor, he led his prisoner
  to where the police car was waiting.</p>

  <p>"You weren't seen, but you were heard," he explained.</p>

  <p>White Face laughed.</p>

  <p>"A taxicab in low gear is a menace to the security of the criminal
  classes," he said lightly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was a complete dearth of news when Michael Quigley
  reached the station. Negative reports are never sent to minor stations, and
  the absence of anything positive was sufficient to indicate that the search
  for the missing taxicab had so far been fruitless.</p>

  <p>To kill time he wandered up and down the streets, revisited the scene of
  the murder, would have gone again to Gallows Court for news, if Gallows Court
  had not come out to meet him.</p>

  <p>Michael was turning over the mud in the gutter with the toe of his boot
  when he saw the odd figure of the crazy man crossing the road. This strange
  apparition had one curious (and welcome) characteristic. He avoided the
  light, and no sooner had he come within the range of the arc lamp, than he
  halted and half turned away from its searching beams.</p>

  <p>"Come over here, reporter! I've got something to tell you."</p>

  <p>"You can tell me your name to start with."</p>

  <p>The oddity chuckled. "I ain't got a name. My parents forgot to give me
  one." (This astounding statement, Michael discovered was true.) "People call
  me anything they like&mdash;Shoey, some of 'em, because I used to black
  shoes."</p>

  <p>"What have you got to tell me?" asked Michael.</p>

  <p>"He took the doctor away."</p>

  <p>He said this in a hoarse whisper.</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;White Face?"</p>

  <p>Shoey nodded violently.</p>

  <p>"I've got all the rights of it now. He took him in his cab&mdash;he was
  layin' there on the floor and nobody knew."</p>

  <p>He doubled up with silent laughter and slapped his knees in an agony of
  enjoyment.</p>

  <p>"That makes me laugh! Mason don't know! All these clever busies from
  Scotland Yard, and they don't know that!"</p>

  <p>"What are the 'rights of it'?" asked Michael.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, Mason had said, this strange creature was nearer to the truth
  than a saner man.</p>

  <p>"Elk knows."</p>

  <p>The man without a name stuck a grimy forefinger into Michael's ribs to
  point his remark.</p>

  <p>"That fellow's wider than Broad Street. Elk! I'll bet you he knowed all
  the time! But he likes to keep things to hisself until he's got 'em all
  cleared up. I've heard Bray say that&mdash;Bray's got no more brains than a
  rabbit," he added.</p>

  <p>Somebody was walking along the sidewalk towards them.</p>

  <p>"That's him!" whispered the ragged object and melted across the
  street.</p>

  <p>Bray was at such a distance that it seemed impossible for anybody to
  recognise that it was he. It appeared that he was walking off a
  grievance.</p>

  <p>"As soon as this affair is over I'm going to put things straight," he said
  aggressively. "Mason really shouldn't do it! You understand, Quigley, that an
  officer of my rank has his position to uphold; and how can I uphold it if
  important inquiries are placed in the hands of subordinates? Insubordinates,
  I call 'em!"</p>

  <p>"What's Elk been doing now?"</p>

  <p>There was no need to ask who was the offender.</p>

  <p>"Mason is a good fellow," Bray went on, "one of the best men in the force
  and one of the cutest. It you ever get a chance of dropping a hint that I
  said that, I'd be obliged, Quigley. You needn't make a point of repeating the
  conversation, but just mention it accidentally&mdash;he takes a lot of notice
  of what you say. But he's altogether wrong about Elk. Evil," he went on
  poetically, "is wrought by want of thought as well as want of
  heart&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shakespeare?" murmured Michael.</p>

  <p>"I dare say," said Bray, who had no idea that American citizens wrote
  poetry. "Mason does these things thoughtlessly. I told him I was willing to
  cross-examine this woman as soon as she came round and was in a fit state to
  talk. But no, Elk must do it! Elk knows her, apparently. But I ask you,
  Quigley, is it necessary to know a person before you question 'em? Was I
  properly introduced to Lamborn&mdash;there's another scandal; he's out on
  bail!"</p>

  <p>To shorten the length of the grievance, Michael suggested that they should
  walk back together to the station. They arrived at an interesting time for
  Inspector Bray, because Lorna Weston had decided to talk.</p>

  <p>She had refused to go into the inspector's office, and was seated in the
  charge-room, the bandaged Elk towering over her. Michael could see that it
  was not his but Bray's presence which brought that demoniacal frown to the
  sergeant's face when they appeared.</p>

  <p>"All right, let's have all the press in, Bray," he said savagely. "Won't
  you come into the private office, Mrs. Weston?"</p>

  <p>"No, I won't." The pale-faced woman was determined on the point. "I'll say
  what I want to say here."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Elk grimly. And to Shale, who was the stenographer of
  the party: "Get your book. You're known as Lorna Weston," he began, "and
  you're the wife of&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>She had parted her lips to speak when Mason came in briskly; behind him
  came two detectives and between them walked their prisoner.</p>

  <p>Lorna Weston came up to her feet, her eyes fixed upon the smiling man who
  stood between the two guards&mdash;unconcerned, perfectly at his ease, not by
  so much as the droop of an eye betraying consciousness of his deadly
  peril.</p>

  <p>"There he is! There he is!" she shrieked, pointing at him. "The murderer!
  You killed him! You said you would if you ever met him, and you did it!"</p>

  <p>Mason watched the prisoner curiously, but he made no response.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't for me you hated him. It wasn't because he took me away from
  you&mdash;it was because of your brother who died in prison."</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was because of that," he said simply. "If he could be brought to life
  and I were free, I'd kill him again."</p>

  <p>"Do you hear him?" she shrieked. "My husband&mdash;Tommy Furse!"</p>

  <p>"Call me by my real name," said the other. "Thomas Marford! It is a pretty
  good name, though it has been borne by some pretty bad people."</p>

  <p>He turned smilingly to Mason.</p>

  <p>"You won't want this lady, I think? I can tell you all you wish to know,
  and I will clear up any point which may seem to you to be obscure."</p>

  <p>Michael Quigley stood petrified, unable to speak or move. Marford! This
  self-possessed man... White Face... hold-up man, murderer... He must be
  dreaming. But no, here was the reality.</p>

  <p>Marford, as unemotional as the crowd of detectives who stood around him,
  was twiddling his watch-chain, looking half amused, half pityingly at the
  shivering woman who called herself his wife.</p>

  <p>He was evidently considering something else than his own position.</p>

  <p>"I hope Dr. Rudd will feel no ill-effects from his unhappy experience," he
  said. "As I told you earlier in the morning, I don't think he will suffer
  anything worse than a headache, which he can easily remedy. He has been in my
  garage all the night. You see," he was almost apologetic, "Rudd had a theory,
  which was to me a very dangerous theory on the lips of a rather loquacious
  and not terribly clever man. His view, which he was developing most
  uncomfortably, was that there was only one person who could possibly have
  killed Bateman&mdash;and that was myself! He thought it was a huge joke, but
  it wasn't a joke to me; and when he called in at my surgery on the way to the
  station to put his ideas before you, I realised at once that I was in
  considerable danger. I realised more than this," he added calmly, "that my
  life's work was done, that my clinic and my convalescent home and my new
  rest-house at Annerford&mdash;how did you find your way to Annerford Farm, by
  the way? But perhaps you wouldn't like to tell me&mdash;were things of the
  past, and that I must save myself at all costs."</p>

  <p>He looked round and caught Elk's eye and shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"I had to do it, Elk. I'm terribly sorry. You're the last man in the world
  I would have hurt."</p>

  <p>To Mason's surprise, Elk grinned amiably.</p>

  <p>"I don't know anyone I'd rather take a coshing from," he said
  handsomely.</p>

  <p>"You were a dangerous man, too," smiled Marford, "but I couldn't give you
  a whisky and soda with a little shot of drug in it, as I gave to Dr. Rudd.
  Just enough to put him under for a few minutes. What I did then was to dope
  him and put him in the garage. I was afraid he had betrayed me later, when I
  heard him groaning. You probably heard him groaning, too; I think you
  mentioned the fact to me?"</p>

  <p>He addressed the reporter, and Michael remembered the noise he had heard
  as he had moved through Gallows Court in the dead of the night.</p>

  <p>"There is one other matter I'm concerned about&mdash;how is old Gregory?
  I'm afraid he's taken it rather badly."</p>

  <p>He talked fluently enough, but with a little slur in his voice. It was the
  first time Mason had noticed that he had an impediment of speech which caused
  him to lisp a little. "I'm rather anxious you should take my statement
  now."</p>

  <p>Mason nodded.</p>

  <p>"I must caution you, Dr. Marford&mdash;I suppose you are a doctor,
  Marford?"</p>

  <p>Marford inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am qualified: lay anything to my door but the charge of being a
  quack! You can confirm this by a visit to my surgery, where you will find the
  certificates."</p>

  <p>"I have to warn you," Mason went on conventionally, "that what you now say
  may be taken down and used at your trial."</p>

  <p>"That I understand," said Marford.</p>

  <p>He looked at his wife; she had approached more closely to him; her dark
  eyes were blazing with hate; the straight, white mouth was bloodless.</p>

  <p>"You'll hang for this, Tommy!" she breathed. "Oh, God, I'm glad
  &mdash;you'll hang for it!"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he asked coolly, and, turning on his heels, followed Mason into
  the inspector's office.</p>

  <p>"A nice woman," was his only comment on his wife's outburst. "Her loyalty
  to her unfortunate friend is almost touching&mdash;but then, loyalty
  invariably is. I cannot let myself think about poor Gregory Wicks."</p>

  <p>He was sincere: Mason had no doubt of it. There was no cynicism in his
  tone. Whatever else he might be, Thomas Marford was not a hypocrite.</p>

  <p>Mason offered him a glass of water, which he refused.</p>

  <p>He sat down by the side of the writing-table; his only request was that
  somebody should open a window, for the room was unpleasantly crowded. And
  then he told his story. He did not refuse a cigarette, but through most of
  the narrative he held it and its many successors between his fingers and only
  occasionally raised it to his lips.</p>

  <p>"Are you ready?" he asked, and Sergeant Shale, who had opened a new
  notebook, tested his fountain pen and nodded.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"

  <p class="first">"ONE always tries to find a beginning to these stories"
  (said Dr. Marford), "and usually one chooses to enumerate the virtues and
  describe the splendid domestic qualities of one's father and mother. That I
  do not purpose doing, for many reasons.</p>

  <p>"My brother and I were left orphans at an early age. I was at a
  preparatory school when Walter went out to Australia to try his luck. He was
  a decent fellow, the best brother any man could wish to have. The little
  money that came to us from the sale of my father's practice&mdash;oh, yes, he
  was a doctor&mdash;he put in the hands of a lawyer for my education. He
  hadn't been in Australia long before he found work, and half his salary used
  to come to the lawyer every month.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what date his criminal career began, but when I was about
  fifteen I had a letter from him, asking me to address all future letters to
  'Walter Furse.' He was then in Perth, Western Australia. His full name was
  Walter Furse Marford. Naturally, I did as I was asked, and soon after larger
  monthly sums came to the lawyer and were very welcome, for I had been living
  practically without pocket money, and my clothes were the scorn of the
  school.</p>

  <p>"By this time I was at a high school, or, as they call it in England, a
  public school, which I shall also refrain from mentioning, because every
  public school boy has a sneaking pride in his school. One day the lawyer came
  to see me. He asked me whether I had heard from my brother, and I told him I
  had not had a letter from him for four months. He told me that he was in a
  similar case, but that, previous to my brother's ceasing to correspond, he
  had sent a thousand pounds. But all the lawyer's letters asking how he would
  like this money invested had been unanswered. I was a little alarmed,
  naturally, because I had a very deep affection for Walter, and realised, as I
  had grown older, just what I owed to him. I was to go to a hospital and take
  up the profession of my father &mdash;it was my brother's money which made
  this possible.</p>

  <p>"The mystery of Walter's silence was explained when I received, in a
  roundabout way, a letter which had been sent to a friend of his, and which
  was by him transmitted to me. It was written on blue paper, and when I saw on
  the heading the name of an Australian convict prison I nearly fainted. But it
  was the truth: Walter hid nothing in the letter, though in justice to him it
  contained no cant of repentance. He had been arrested after holding up a
  bank, where he and his gang had got away with nearly twenty thousand pounds.
  He asked me to think as well of him as I could, and said that he was telling
  me because he was afraid the authorities might trace me, and I should hear
  from some unsympathetic person the story of his fall.</p>

  <p>"I will tell the truth. After the first shock I was not horrified at the
  revelation. Walter had always been an adventurous sort, and at my age I had
  that touch of romanticism which exaggerates certain picturesque types of
  crime into deeds almost worthy of a Paladin. My reaction to the blow was that
  I felt an increasing love for the man who had made such sacrifices and had
  taken such risks in order to fit his brother for membership of a noble
  profession.</p>

  <p>"I exalted him above all men, and I yet do. But for the burden which my
  education and living imposed upon him, he could have afforded to live
  honestly, and I know, though he never told me, that I and I alone was
  responsible for his entering into the crooked path.</p>

  <p>"The letter which I sent to him was, I am afraid, rather disjointed, and
  had in it a suggestion of hero-worship, for when he was released from prison
  he answered me very straightly; pointed out that there was nothing admirable
  in what he was doing, and that he would sooner see me dead than go the way he
  had gone.</p>

  <p>"I worked like the devil at the hospital, determined to justify his
  sacrifice, if it could be justified. From time to time he wrote me, now from
  Melbourne, once from Brisbane, several times from a town in New South Wales,
  the name of which I cannot at the moment recall. Apparently he was going
  straight, for there were no delays in his letters; he told me that he was
  thinking of buying a 'station,' that he had already acquired a house and a
  few hundred acres in the hope to extend these by the purchase of other
  land.</p>

  <p>"It was in this letter that I first heard of Donald Bateman. He said that
  he had met a very clever crook and had nearly been caught by him in
  connection with a land deal, but that a mutual friend, who had been in prison
  with Walter, had made them known to one another, Bateman had apologised, and
  they were now chums.</p>

  <p>"Bateman apparently made his money out of persuading innocent purchasers
  to put up a deposit on imaginary properties, but he did a little other crook
  work on the side, and was one of the best-informed men in Australia on one
  topic&mdash;the security and deposit of banks. He himself was not a bank
  robber, but he supplied the various gangs with exact information which
  enabled them to operate at a minimum risk. Usually he stood in for his
  corner&mdash;by which I mean&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I know what you mean," said Mason.</p>

  <p>"As soon as my final examinations were over Walter wanted me to come out
  to Australia and stay with him for six months, to discuss future plans. He
  asked me if I would mind adopting the name of Furse. He said he could arrange
  to get me my passport and ticket in that name. The only awkward point about
  this arrangement was that my examinations finished on the Friday, I was to
  leave for Australia on the Saturday, and I could not know the result of the
  exams, except by letter. I arranged, however, with the manager of the bank
  which carried my account to have the certificates addressed care of the bank
  and for him to send them on to an address which my brother had given me. I
  had to invent a family reason why I was calling myself Furse in Australia,
  and he seemed satisfied.</p>

  <p>"The work at the hospital grew increasingly hard. The last days of the
  examination came, and on the Friday I handed in my final papers with a
  heartfelt sense of thankfulness. The results would not be known for some
  weeks, but I had a pretty good idea that I had passed except in one subject.
  As it happened, my highest marks were for the subject in which I thought I
  had failed!</p>

  <p>"The next morning, as happy as a child, I drove off to St. Pancras and
  Tilbury, and on the Saturday afternoon was steaming down the Channel, so
  excited that I hardly knew what to do with myself.</p>

  <p>"The boat had a full complement of passengers. I was travelling
  second-class, because, although my brother had sent the first-class fare, I
  wanted to save him as much as possible, and second-class on a P. &amp; O.
  steamer is extraordinarily comfortable,</p>

  <p>"This particular ship was crowded with people, the majority of whom were
  bound for India and quite a number for Colombo. We dropped the Indian
  passengers at Port Said or Suez&mdash;I'm not sure which&mdash;and now that
  the dining-room was thinned out and there was space to walk about the decks,
  one began to take notice of one's fellow passengers.</p>

  <p>"I had seen Lorna Weston the day we left England, but I did not speak to
  her until we were passing through the Suez Canal, and then only to exchange a
  few words about the scenery.</p>

  <p>"It was at Colombo, where we both went ashore, that I came to know her.
  She was very pretty and vivacious, and was, she told me, travelling to
  Australia to take a position as nursery governess. Looking back from my
  present age, I can see that, if I had had more experience of life, I should
  have known she was much too young for the job, and should have guessed, what
  I later knew, that she was going out in the hope of finding easy money.</p>

  <p>"I told her very little about myself, except that I was a medical student,
  but for some reason or other she got it into her head that I was a wealthy
  young man or had wealthy relatives. She may have got this idea because I was
  travelling second from choice, or because I had a lot of money in my
  possession&mdash;I had a couple of hundred pounds in notes which I had
  managed to save from my allowance. I had an idiotic idea that it would please
  Walter if I handed him back this colossal sum, as it appeared to me, out of
  the money he had so generously sent me.</p>

  <p>"If you know anything about ship travel you will understand that it takes
  no more than a few days for an ordinary friendship between a young man and a
  girl to develop into a raging passion. We were not five days out of Colombo
  when, if she had asked me to jump over the side of the ship, I should have
  obeyed. I adored her. I loved her, and she loved me. So we told each other.
  I'm not complaining about her, I'm not reproaching her, and I don't want to
  say one single word that's going to make life any harder for her, except that
  I must tell the truth to explain why she was living in Tidal Basin.</p>

  <p>"She only loved one man in her life, and that was Bateman. I say this
  without bitterness or hatred. She probably loved the worst man she has ever
  met or is ever destined to meet. It is not necessary for me to tell you what
  happened during the remainder of the voyage. I had moments of exaltation, of
  despair, or I resolve, or terrible depression. I wondered what Walter would
  say when I told him that at the outset of my career, before I was in a
  position to earn a penny, I had engaged myself to a girl who had been a
  perfect stranger to me when I went on board.</p>

  <p>"He came down to the dock to meet me, and I introduced him to Lorna, but I
  did not tell him of my intentions until we were back in the hotel where he
  was staying and where he had rented a room for me. To my surprise, he took it
  very well.</p>

  <p>"'You're a bit young, Tommy, but I'm not so sure that it's a bad thing for
  you. If I had married I mightn't have made such a fool of myself. But don't
  you think you could wait for a year?'</p>

  <p>"I told him there were imperative reasons why we should marry almost at
  once, and his face fell.</p>

  <p>"'She told you that, I suppose? She may be mistaken.'</p>

  <p>"But I couldn't argue the matter, and after a while Walter agreed.</p>

  <p>"'I'm going through a pretty bad time,' he said. 'I've been speculating on
  the Stock Exchange, and I've lost quite a lot of money racing. But things
  will take a turn soon, and you shall have the best wedding present that money
  can buy.'</p>

  <p>"How bad was his financial position I only discovered by accident. He had
  sold his little property and for the moment was without occupation. His
  prison life had naturally brought him into contact with all sorts of
  undesirables, but so far he had resisted their solicitations, and had steered
  a straight path.</p>

  <p>"Walter was not a strong character. Viewed dispassionately, he was a
  weakling, because he invariably took the easiest route. But he had the heart
  of a good woman, and I can't help feeling that again it was to make some
  provision for me that he fell back into his old ways. In fact, I am sure of
  it. His wedding present to me was five hundred pounds, and it didn't make me
  a bit happy, because I had read in the papers that a country bank had been
  stuck up the day before and a considerable sum of money had been stolen. In
  fact, I taxed him with it, but he laughed it off.</p>

  <p>"It was a few days after the wedding that I made up my mind. I left Lorna
  at the hotel and went in search of Walter. I found him in a restaurant which
  was also a bar, and that was the first time I met Donald Bateman. Bateman
  went out, and I took this opportunity to put forward my proposal, which was
  no less than that I should share a little of his risk.</p>

  <p>"'You're mad,' he said, when it dawned upon him what I meant.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I was. But if I were to analyse my motive from the standpoint
  of my experience, I should say I was no more than stupidly quixotic. He
  wouldn't hear of it, but I insisted.</p>

  <p>"'You've been taking these risks for me all these years. You've suffered
  imprisonment. Every time you go out on one of your adventures you stand the
  risk of being killed. Let me take a little of it.'</p>

  <p>"Bateman came back at that moment, and I realised he was well in Walter's
  confidence. I tried to put the matter hypothetically to Bateman, without
  betraying myself and Walter, but it was a fairly childish effort, and he saw
  through it at once.</p>

  <p>"'Why not, Walter? It's better than taking in any of these
  roustabouts&mdash;Grayling or the Dutchman. Besides, he's a gentleman, and
  nobody would imagine he was a member of a gang of crooks.'</p>

  <p>"Walter was furious, but his fury did not last long: he was, as I say,
  weak, though I'm not blaming him, for, if he had refused, I believe I should
  have gone off and stuck up a bank of my own out of sheer bravado.</p>

  <p>"We all three went back to the hotel, and I introduced my wife to Bateman.
  He was a good-looking fellow in those days and terribly popular with women;
  the worse they were the more was the fascination he seemed to exercise.
  Although I was only a kid, I could see she was tremendously attracted by him,
  and the next day, when I went out with Walter to talk matters over with him,
  I came back to find that Bateman had lunched with her, and thereafter they
  hardly left one another. I wasn't jealous; I'd got over my first madness and
  realised that I'd made a ghastly mistake.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, I didn't want any complications with Bateman, who I knew was
  married and had left his wife in England. As a matter of fact, he was married
  before he met and married the present Mrs. Landor&mdash;the lady who came to
  my surgery on the night I killed Bateman and told me, to my
  amazement&mdash;however, that can wait.</p>

  <p>"Walter at last agreed that I should stand in and help him with the
  robbery of a country bank which carried a considerable amount of paper
  currency, especially during week-ends. The job was to be done 'two-handed,'
  as we say, and Bateman, of course, took no part in the actual hold-up, but
  was the man who spied out the land, supplied us with all particulars as to
  the movements and habits of the staff, and could discover, in some way I've
  never understood, almost to a pound how much cash reserve a branch office was
  holding.</p>

  <p>"It was a little town about sixty-five miles from Melbourne, and Walter
  and I drove out overnight in a motorcar and stayed with a friend of his till
  morning. Naturally I was wild with excitement, and I was all for carrying a
  gun. Walter wouldn't hear of this. He never carried firearms, the only pistol
  he used being a dummy&mdash;that was a lesson I never forgot.</p>

  <p>"'You're either going to murder or you're not going to murder,' said
  Walter. 'If you're going out to rob, a dummy pistol's as good as any. It's
  its persuasive power and its frightening power that are important.'</p>

  <p>"He was a man of extraordinary principles, and held very strong views on
  criminals who used firearms.</p>

  <p>"'It's the job of a bank official to defend his property, and if you kill
  him you're a coward,' he said. 'It's the job of a copper to arrest you, and
  if you shoot at him you're a blackguard.'</p>

  <p>"But he had no especial affection for the police; no faith in them; and
  before we went out, he had insisted on my having all my pockets sewn up with
  strong packthread.</p>

  <p>"'You only want a handkerchief, and you can carry that in your sleeve,' he
  said.</p>

  <p>"I didn't see why he took this precaution, until he explained that it was
  not unusual, if the police caught a prisoner, to slip a gun into his pocket
  in order to get him a longer sentence. I don't know whether this was true. It
  may be one of the yarns that crooks invent and believe in.</p>

  <p>"We carried our dummy pistols in a belt under our waistcoats. You'll find
  all the particulars of the raid we made upon the branch bank, in a little
  scrap-book in my bedroom. It was successful. At the appointed minute we
  entered the bank with white masks on our faces; I held up the cashier and his
  assistant with my dummy pistol whilst Walter passed round the counter, pulled
  the safe open&mdash;it was already unfastened &mdash;and took out three
  bundles of notes. We were out of the town before the police had wakened up
  from their midday sleep.</p>

  <p>"We came back to Melbourne by a circuitous route, and I'll swear there was
  nobody in the town who would have recognised us or who could have identified
  us in any way. That evening the Melbourne papers were full of the robbery,
  and announced that the Bank of Australasia were offering five thousand pounds
  for the arrest of the robbers, and this was supplemented by a statement
  issued on behalf of the Government, through the police, that a free pardon
  would be granted to any person, other than one of the perpetrators, or any
  accomplice, who might turn King's Evidence. Walter was worried about this
  notice. He knew Donald Bateman better than I.</p>

  <p>"'If he gets the reward as well as the pardon, we're cooked,' he said, and
  when he put through a telephone inquiry to the newspaper office and heard
  that the reward was to go to anybody, accomplice or not, he went white.</p>

  <p>"'Go and find your wife, Tommy,' he said. 'We've got to slip out of this
  town quick! There's a boat leaving for San Francisco this afternoon. We might
  both go on that. I'll see the purser and we can travel in different
  classes.'</p>

  <p>"I went to the hotel, but Lorna was out; the porter told me she had gone
  with Mr. Bateman to the races, and I returned to Walter and told him.</p>

  <p>"'Maybe he won't see the offer until after the races are over. That is our
  only chance," he said. 'You'd better leave her a note and some money, tell
  her you'll let her know where she can join you.'</p>

  <p>"Returning to the hotel, I packed a few things and wrote the note. When I
  walked out of the elevator into the vestibule, the first person I saw was Big
  Jock Riley, Chief of the Melbourne Detective Service. I only knew him because
  he'd been pointed out to me as a man to avoid. I'll say this about
  him&mdash;he's dead now, poor chap!&mdash;that he was a decent fellow. I knew
  what was going to happen when he came towards me and took the suit-case out
  of my hand and gave it to another man.</p>

  <p>"'You'd better pay your bill, Tommy,' he said. 'It will save everybody a
  lot of bother.'</p>

  <p>"He went with me to the cashier, and I paid the bill, and then he took me
  to a taxi and we drove to the police station. The first person I saw when I
  got in was Walter. They'd taken him soon after I had left, and I learnt that
  I had been followed to the hotel, and they had only waited until I had
  collected my kit before they arrested me. That was one of Riley's
  peculiarities, that he made all crooks pay their hotel bills before he
  arrested them. They said that his wife owned three hotels in Melbourne, but
  that is probably another invention.</p>

  <p>"The police found most of the money&mdash;not all, for Walter had planted
  four thousand pounds, and had paid two thousand to Bateman, which Bateman
  returned when he found he was going to get the five thousand reward.</p>

  <p>"Bateman was the informer, of course. He hadn't gone to the races: he was
  sitting in another room at the police office when we were brought in, and he
  came out to identify us. Walter said nothing; he didn't look at him. I think
  he must have had a premonition that this had been his last day of freedom, he
  was so utterly broken and dejected. But I met Bateman's eyes, and he knew
  that if ever he and I met, there would be a reckoning. Is that melodramatic?
  I'm afraid it is.</p>

  <p>"There's very little to tell about the court proceedings. The prosecution
  was fair, and we were sentenced, Walter to eight years and I to three. I
  never saw Walter after we left the cells until I was taken to the prison
  hospital where he was dying. He was too far gone to recognise me. Riley was
  there; he'd come to see if he could get any information about the four
  thousand that was cached. He told me, while I was waiting to be taken back,
  that if I would tell him he would get me a year's remission of my sentence. I
  was so utterly miserable that I was on the point of telling him, but I
  thought better of it, and told him only half the truth.</p>

  <p>"There was two thousand planted in one place and two thousand in another.
  I needn't tell you where, but one was a respectable bank. I told him the
  hardest, and I believe he went away and recovered it, because within a week I
  had my order of release. Riley never broke a promise.</p>

  <p>"I hung around Melbourne for a month. I didn't have to look for Lorna: I
  knew she'd gone&mdash;you get news in prison&mdash;and that Bateman had gone
  with her. That didn't worry me at all. I was certain that Bateman and I would
  meet sooner or later. It's curious how Walter's warning always stayed with
  me. I have never owned a pistol in my life, and even in my most revengeful
  mood I never dreamt of buying one.</p>

  <p>"The police left me alone when I came out. Riley may have suspected that
  there was more money to collect, but probably he wasn't bothering his head
  about that. I had had all my English letters sent to a certain address in
  Melbourne, and when I went to this place I found a dozen old bills, receipts,
  letters from hospital friends, and a long envelope.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes when I was in prison I used to wonder what had been the result
  of those examinations, but after a time I ceased to take any interest in
  them. It seemed that whatever honest career I had had was finished. I should
  be struck off the Medical Register on conviction, and that was the end of my
  doctoring. I didn't realise that the Australian authorities knew nothing of
  'Marford'&mdash;knew only Tommy Furse &mdash;and it was only when I opened
  the envelope and took out the stiff parchment certificate that the truth
  dawned on me. In England I was Dr. Marford, a duly and properly qualified
  medical man. I could begin practice at once. A new and wonderful vista was
  opened, for I was terribly keen on my work, and had determined to specialise
  in the diseases of childhood.</p>

  <p>"I collected the two thousand, and after a reasonable interval left
  Australia for England, travelling third class as far as Colombo and
  transferring to first class from that port. It was a little too sultry in the
  steerage, and I could afford better accommodation. I stopped off in Egypt; I
  wanted to break completely all association with Australia, to snap the links
  of acquaintanceship formed on the ship which might extend to somebody who
  knew me and my record. In Cairo I presented my credentials to the British
  Minister, obtained a new passport in place of one which I said I'd lost, and
  travelled overland through Italy and Switzerland, arriving in London at the
  end of September.</p>

  <p>"My intentions were to buy a small practice, and I had no sooner arrived
  in London than I called on an agent, who promised me very considerable help,
  said he had the very thing for me, but who proved to be worse than useless,
  submitting propositions which I could not afford to buy or country practices
  which I knew I could not keep. Country people are very conservative where
  doctors are concerned, and do not trust any medical man until he has grown a
  white beard or lost his eyesight."</p>

  <p>"I decided to build up a practice of my own in London. I had fifteen
  hundred pounds left of my money, and by a system of strict economy I knew I
  could live for five years without a patient&mdash;three years if I carried
  out my big plan, which was to establish a sunlight clinic for babies. I have
  always had a natural enthusiasm for work amongst children. I love children,
  and if I had not been interrupted by Donald Bateman and my wife, I should
  within a few years have opened a great institution, which would have cost
  twenty thousand pounds to build and ten thousand a year to maintain. That was
  my ambition.</p>

  <p>"It is common knowledge that I opened a surgery in Endley Street and
  started my practice as cheaply as any practice has ever been founded. From
  the first I was successful in obtaining patients. They were of the cheapest
  kind, and required nineteen shillings back for every pound they spent, but it
  was interesting work, and in a burst of enthusiasm I arranged to open my
  first clinic at the farther end of Endley Street. I reckoned that by the
  practice of the strictest economy I could live on the earnings from my
  practice, and that the money I had so carefully hoarded could keep the clinic
  running for two years.</p>

  <p>"And then one day a thunderbolt fell. A woman walked into my
  consulting-room. At the time I was at my desk, writing a prescription for a
  patient who had seen me a few minutes before. I saw her sit down without
  looking at her; and then, as I asked, 'What can I do for you?' I looked up
  &mdash;into the eyes of Lorna Marford, my wife!</p>

  <p>"I had forgotten her. That is no exaggeration. Literally she had passed
  out of my life and out of my memory. I had half forgotten Donald Bateman. For
  a moment I did not recognise her, and then she smiled, and my heart felt like
  a piece of lead.</p>

  <p>"'What do you want?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"She was very poorly dressed and shabby-looking, and was lodging at that
  time with a Mrs. Albert. She was, she told me, three or four weeks behind
  with her rent.</p>

  <p>"'I want money,' she said coolly.</p>

  <p>"'Isn't there a man called Bateman?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"She laughed at this and made a little gesture. I knew from that that she
  was still fond of him, and that he'd left her.</p>

  <p>"'Bateman's gone. He and I have not seen each other for over two years,'
  she said.</p>

  <p>"She told me the kind of life she had been living, how she had been forced
  into a slum by sheer poverty. I felt sorry for her&mdash;I find it very easy
  to be sorry for women. But I remembered also that she had taken her share of
  the blood money, and had probably helped in our betrayal. There were a lot of
  little happenings that I remembered afterwards in prison which gave colour to
  this view. And I remembered Walter, dying in a prison hospital, so
  friendless, so lonely, so heartbroken.</p>

  <p>"'You'll get no money from me," I said. "You had your share of the reward,
  I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"'I had a bit of it,' she answered coolly. Not so much as I deserved. The
  police would never have found your white masks but for me.'</p>

  <p>"Her coolness took my breath away. I got up from the table and opened the
  door.</p>

  <p>"'You can go,' I said, but she did not stir.</p>

  <p>"'I want a hundred pounds,' she said. 'I'm sick of living in poverty.'</p>

  <p>"I could only look at her; I was speechless.</p>

  <p>"'Why should I give you a hundred pounds, supposing I had it?'</p>

  <p>"'Because,' she answered slowly, 'if you don't give me a hundred pounds I
  shall tell somebody that you are an ex-convict. And then where will you
  be&mdash;doctor?'</p>

  <p>"From that day onwards she blackmailed me. Within three months I had only
  half the money that I had put aside for the clinic, and I had committed
  myself to twice as much: ordered lamps, beds, structural alterations, and had
  practically placed myself under an obligation to buy the premises in five
  years' time.</p>

  <p>"If I could have got her to leave the neighbourhood I might have had some
  respite; but though I was giving her a big sum every week, and she could have
  lived in comfort in the West End, she insisted, when she changed her
  lodgings, upon taking rooms locally, and upon these she spent a sum
  equivalent to my yearly income.</p>

  <p>"Why she refused to live somewhere else I did not know. It puzzled me,
  until one day there flashed upon me the solution. She believed that sooner or
  later I should meet Donald Bateman&mdash;she wanted to be on hand to watch
  every movement of mine, so that she might save her lover. She may have had a
  premonition. That phenomenon is outside the ambit of my knowledge. I am a
  physiologist; mental and psychic phenomena I know nothing about.</p>

  <p>"It seemed there was not one chance in a million that I should ever see
  Donald Bateman again. Suppose he came to London, what likelihood was there
  that he should come to such an out-of-the&mdash;way spot as Tidal Basin? And
  yet I had met with some odd coincidences. The very first doctor I met, when I
  came to the place, was Dr. Rudd&mdash;and I had heard Bateman speak of Rudd.
  Rudd had been prison doctor at a county jail where Bateman had served two
  years' hard labour! I remembered the name and the description the moment I
  saw him. It is quite possible that he also saw the doctor in London, but of
  that I know nothing. He hated Rudd, who had been the cause of his getting
  extra punishment for malingering whilst he was in prison, and he often
  described him&mdash;unflatteringly, but, I must say, faithfully.</p>

  <p>"The demands from the clinic increased with the growth of my ambition. I
  was desperately hard pressed for money. On the one hand, by the legitimate
  expansion of my experiment, on the other by the increasing demands from
  Lorna.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what gave me the idea; I rather think it was the pathetic
  distress of old Gregory Wicks when I told him that he could never take out
  his cab again except at the gravest risk to himself and to the community. He
  was nearly blind, and his misery at the idea of surrendering the licence he
  had held for fifty-five years touched me. I thought how useful a taxicab
  might be, and how easily one might make up as Gregory. One thought suggested
  another, and when the idea took definite shape I was thrilled by the
  prospect. Isn't there a legend of an old highwayman who robbed the rich to
  give to the poor? That would not have amused me; but to take toll of those
  wealthy people who had ignored the appeals I had hectographed and posted
  broadcast, and use the money to extend my clinic &mdash;that was a fantastic
  but a fascinating thought.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I was ever completely happy until I began my raids. I
  planned everything, spent nights in the West End, observing, timing and
  arranging my first coup. I invented, for the benefit of Gregory Wicks, a
  fictitious convict who could not obtain a licence, but who was a good and
  careful driver. I took lodgings for him in Gregory's house, and the old man
  was delighted. It is not true that he never allowed another man to take out
  the cab. He is colossally vain of his own individuality, poor old fellow, and
  the idea that somebody would go out looking very much like him, ply for hire
  and keep alive the traditions of his taciturnity and his hardihood appealed
  to the simple man. Only one stipulation he made, and it was that his
  substitute should place himself under a solemn vow to return any lost
  property he found in the cab. He was inordinately proud of his record.</p>

  <p>"The first mid was ridiculously simple. I took my taxicab to the vicinity
  of a restaurant where smart people go to supper, and, walking boldly into the
  hall, I held up the room with a dummy pistol and got away with the jewels of
  a large, florid woman. I have no regrets. She is probably not starving, for I
  left on her person considerably over ten thousand pounds' worth of
  diamonds.</p>

  <p>"The underworld had given me its confidence. I knew a receiver in Antwerp
  and another in Birmingham, with whom I could place the stones, and the first
  coup gave me enough money to completely re-equip the clinic and to open my
  Eastbourne convalescent home.</p>

  <p>"But I had reckoned without Lorna. She had read an account of the
  stick-up, and it so happened that, unknown to me, she had witnessed my
  return. She came the next morning and demanded her share. Subsequently I gave
  her nearly a thousand pounds. I should have hated her if I was not a
  philosopher. It was much easier for me to pretend she had no existence.</p>

  <p>"The second and third raids were as successful as the first. I paid Lorna
  her share. She was now the talk of the neighbourhood, with her smart dresses.
  She paid visits to the West End in hired cars and was probably living more
  expensively than she had ever lived in her life.</p>

  <p>"If I had any qualms about the work on which I was engaged, they were
  caused by my association with a girl who shall be nameless. I seldom spoke to
  her. She was largely a creature of dreams: her sweetness and her purity were
  all the more transcendent in contrast with the character of my wife.</p>

  <p>"Of Bateman I had seen nothing. I had no idea that he was in England and
  that Lorna had met him by accident in the West End and had asked him to come
  down and see her. The first mention of him I had came one night when I was
  visited at my surgery by a lady who was under the impression that her husband
  had been engaged in a fight and had killed his assailant. She was hysterical,
  and in her hysteria she took me into her confidence, told me of a man who was
  blackmailing her, mentioned his name&mdash;Donald Bateman! When I heard it
  the room seemed to spin round. Bateman was in England&mdash;was in that very
  neighbourhood! Imagine the devil that took possession of me.</p>

  <p>"She grew calm when I assured her that the two men who had been fighting
  were labourers from the docks, and she went away, leaving me in a kind of
  passive delirium. I was almost incapable of thinking reasonably. The old
  loathing for the informer had come back to me. I could see, as plainly as
  though he were before me, the pinched face of my dying brother. It came back
  vividly and seemed to reproach me, that I had let it pass from my mind. Yet
  all in me that was sane told me that it was impossible that I could do
  anything, that it was unlikely I should ever meet Bateman. Could I go
  wandering round the streets of London looking for this blackguard? I should
  know him, of course: he had a knife scar under his chin&mdash;a woman did
  that in Australia. It had only just healed when I arrived in Melbourne.</p>

  <p>"I was still thinking over things after Mrs. Landor had left, when I heard
  voices on the other side of the street. It was raining, and that had driven
  the crowds away and left Endley Street empty. I saw a man in evening dress,
  and I saw a woman run across to him. He had been to her flat, and apparently
  had left something behind. I knew Bateman suffered from angina pectoris, and
  invariably carried a phial of butyl ammonal to be used in case of emergency.
  Apparently he had left this behind at Lorna's flat. I heard him thank her.
  And then I saw them looking across the road towards me, and knew that she had
  already told him who I was. He did not dream that I was as well aware of his
  identity!</p>

  <p>"He sent her back; didn't move till she was out of sight; then he began to
  walk on slowly, and I was preparing to follow, when I saw a man come up to
  him&mdash;it was Landor&mdash;heard a few words, and then saw Landor lash out
  and Donald Bateman fall. He was always a tricky sort of fellow, and it was a
  favourite dodge of his in a fight to pretend he'd been knocked out. In this
  way he saved himself from further punishment. It succeeded with Landor, for
  after a while he walked quickly away, and I lost sight of him.</p>

  <p>"I still hesitated as to what I should do. I knew P.C. Hartford was on his
  beat, saw the flicker of his helmet as he passed under a distant street lamp.
  I could do nothing now.</p>

  <p>"And then Bateman got up, dusted himself and began to walk the way that
  Hartford had come. I saw the man and the constable talking together, and
  Hartford came on. He didn't come far; presently he turned round, and at that
  moment Donald Bateman dropped as if he'd been shot.</p>

  <p>"I knew exactly what had happened: he had a heart attack. My professional
  instincts urged me forward, but at that moment a figure crossed the road and
  crouched over the fallen man&mdash;and Hartford had seen him. He went back,
  quickening his stride, and I followed. As I came along the pavement I saw
  something lying at my feet. It was a broken key-chain, attached to which was
  a bunch of keys. I picked it up and put it in my pocket. The man who was
  searching Bateman's pockets was a well-known local thief named Lamborn. He,
  too, saw the policeman and started to run, but before he could go far
  Hartford had grabbed him.</p>

  <p>"While they were struggling, I came up. Then I saw, lying by the side of
  the man I hated, a sheath knife. It had evidently fallen out of his pocket. I
  had to make my decision quickly. There he lay&mdash;the liar, the traitor,
  the wronger of women, the man who had killed my brother. I don't remember
  taking the knife from its sheath or using it. He never moved&mdash;must have
  died instantly.</p>

  <p>"The struggle between the policeman and the thief was subsiding. I slipped
  the red knife into my pocket. There was excuse for the blood on my
  hands&mdash;I was a doctor handling a murdered man. Nobody questioned me or
  suspected me. A policeman brought me a bucket of water to wash my hands. I
  didn't regret it long. I do not regret it now. I am glad I killed
  him&mdash;proud I killed him!</p>

  <p>"Then came Rudd, an imbecile theorist; but even imbecile theorists
  sometimes and by accident hit upon solutions with diabolical accuracy. And
  Elk suspected. I knew he suspected me from the first. But the real danger
  threatened when Lorna came on to the scene. Her woman's instinct had told her
  something was wrong. She had heard that a man had been murdered, pushed her
  way through the crowd, and went whimpering over the man who had made her what
  she was, if indeed she was not born with more than her share of original
  sin.</p>

  <p>"She didn't see me in the crowd. I knew she was going to speak, and
  wondered how I could stop her. Fortunately, nature intervened and she
  fainted. I was asked to take her to the station. It was the opportunity I
  could have prayed for. We got her into the car and drove a little way till we
  came to a chemist's shop, and I sent the policeman who accompanied me to wake
  up a chemist. He had hardly gone before I slipped a hypodermic syringe out of
  my pocket. It was one I kept loaded, and had prepared for a maternity case.
  The drug was working by the time the policeman came back with a restorative,
  which certainly would not restore her. I waited my opportunity while she was
  in the matron's room, and gave her a second dose &mdash;enough, as I thought,
  to keep her quiet for the rest of the night. It was easy to explain her
  condition when I put the hypodermic syringe and its case in her bag. I would
  have given her a third shot, and called at the infirmary for that purpose,
  but the house surgeon would not allow me to see her.</p>

  <p>"To dispose of her was one thing, to silence Rudd another. I heard he'd
  gone home to bed. I was amazed when he tapped at my window on his way to the
  station and came in with this astounding theory&mdash;astounding in him
  because it was true.</p>

  <p>"'The man (he said) must have been murdered between the time the policeman
  arrested Lamborn and the time I said he was stabbed.' He was working on the
  same grounds as you, Mason. If Lamborn had told the truth at first your task
  would have been simplified. Obviously, Bateman could not have been stabbed
  when the little thief picked his pocket, or his pocket-book and Lamborn's
  hands would have been covered with blood. That was Rudd's theory, too. He
  jokingly accused me of being the murderer, and pointed out certain stains on
  my coat which could not have been there had I not been by the body at the
  moment of killing.</p>

  <p>"Rudd had to be silenced at all costs. I invited him to drink a glass of
  wine with me&mdash;he preferred whisky and soda. Getting his attention fixed
  on my new ray lamp, I doctored his drink. Curiously enough, he detected
  nothing wrong, though he had very little time to detect anything, for he was
  on the ground in ten seconds. I served him as I had served
  Lorna&mdash;carried him into the garage and left him there.</p>

  <p>"I had to get away: I knew that was imperative. But to travel needed
  money, tickets, passport&mdash;things I did not possess. And then, standing
  near the door of the inspector's room, I heard that Landor had a large sum of
  money in his flat. This was my only chance. I went home, got out the taxi and
  drove to a road at the back of Landor's house. I guessed that the place was
  under observation, but I was desperate. Happily, there was a fire escape and
  up this I went.</p>

  <p>"I had the keys of Landor's flat&mdash;I had picked them up on the night
  of the fight. I had to take my chance&mdash;wasn't even sure whether the flat
  was on the first or the second floor. But I had luck. Landor's name was on a
  brass plate, and I opened the door and went in. I had hardly closed the door
  behind me when I was startled to hear a woman's voice asking if I was Louis.
  I have a memory for voices, and I recognised it instantly as the lady who had
  called at my surgery that night. I kept quiet, fearing that at any moment she
  would come out and put on the lights. But she went back into her room and I
  crept along, looking for a hiding-place. There was a small room which, from
  its furnishing, was, I guessed, a maid's room. I got into here; the key was
  on the inside and I turned it. Landor arrived two minutes afterwards; and
  then, to my embarrassment, I heard Elk and Inspector Bray. Again I was
  fortunate: the detectives left with the Landors and gave me a few minutes to
  get the money and tickets&mdash;though neither these nor the passport could
  have been of much use to me. They had been located for me by Landor, who had
  told the detectives what was in the drawer.</p>

  <p>"I had hoped to take the money and make my getaway before Elk returned,
  but he came back too soon, and the life-preserver, which was the only weapon
  I carried, had to be employed. I can't say how sorry I was to strike down a
  man whom I have always regarded as a friend.</p>

  <p>"And there was another danger, I discovered when I got back to the
  surgery. Rudd was returning to consciousness. I heard him groan as I went
  along the yard to give him a second injection, and I wondered who else
  had.</p>

  <p>"There was one chance of getting away, but when I had finished my
  preparations and had brought the car to the back door I was rung up from the
  police station with the news that Mason was on his way. I knew my last minute
  of safety had arrived, and on the spur of the moment I invented the
  forthcoming visit of the man with the white mask. I planned it all out,
  sprinkled the passage with a bottle of beef extract, which would look like
  blood in artificial light, tested the switches and oiled the bolts outside
  the door, between the time the detectives left the station and arrived at the
  surgery.</p>

  <p>"I still had to get out, but I had arranged that, too. There is on my desk
  a bell-push which rings in the passage, and which I use as a signal for the
  next patient to come in. I waited my opportunity and rang the bell, using the
  signal which I had said White Face invariably used. Thereafter it was easy;
  to hold an imaginary conversation with somebody in the hall was a simple
  matter. To slam suddenly and lock the door, pretend that I had been attacked,
  switch out the lights and get away in the cab, occupied a few minutes. I had
  already put Rudd there, since I dared not leave him behind.</p>

  <p>"I made, as you know, for the farm-house I had bought, and which I
  intended turning into a home for tubercular children. Perhaps some
  philanthropist will carry on the good work.</p>

  <p>"I don't think there is anything more that I can tell you. If there is, I
  shall be able to supply any deficiency."</p>

  <p class="first">DR. MARFORD stretched back in his chair, a smile on his
  weary face.</p>

  <p>"Tired, Doctor?" said Mason.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very, very tired," he said.</p>

  <p>"I never knew you had a lisp before?"</p>

  <p>The doctor ignored the question.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, how did you find me at Annerford? Oh, I know." He smiled. "You
  interviewed poor Miss Harman, and she told you that I had another institution
  and naturally you went there."</p>

  <p>Mason nodded.</p>

  <p>"You have no questions to ask me?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mason considered.</p>

  <p>"I don't think there is anything I can ask you, Doctor. You won't tell me
  the names of the two fences who bought the diamonds you stole?"</p>

  <p>Marford shook his head slowly, laughter in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"That would be unprofessional, wouldn't it?" he said.</p>

  <p>"That crazy man in the court&mdash;did he know?"</p>

  <p>"He's a very good guesser. I sometimes think he's psychic," said Marford.
  "Every time I met him he used to give me just the oddest, understanding
  look."</p>

  <p>"I was talking about your lisp just now, Doctor. I've never noticed it
  before," said Mason again.</p>

  <p>"I haven't a lisp"&mdash;Dr. Marford stretched himself luxuriously in his
  chair&mdash;"and I haven't any impediment of speech. But, you see, I
  recognise inevitabilities, and for the last hour and a half I have had in my
  mouth&mdash;it is now between my teeth&mdash;a little glass phial of cyanide
  of potassium&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>Three detectives flung themselves upon him, but it was too late. He
  shuddered slightly; a spasm of pain passed over his face, and he stiffened.
  There was no other movement.</p>

  <p>Mason looked at him in admiration.</p>

  <p>"Game, eh?" he said huskily. "By God, how game!"</p>

  <p>He turned abruptly and walked across to the charge-room, and came,
  bare-headed, into the street, to breathe the sweet air of morning. The day
  was breaking.</p>
