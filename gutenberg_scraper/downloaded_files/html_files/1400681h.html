  <h2><a name="ch-00"
     id="ch-00"></a>PREFACE</h2>

  <p class="first">I HAVE had a life which, for variety and romance, could, I
  think, hardly be exceeded. I have known what it was to be a poor man and I
  have known what it was to be fairly affluent. I have sampled every kind of
  human experience. I have known many of the most remarkable men of my time. I
  have had a long literary career after a medical training which gave me the
  M.D. of Edinburgh. I have tried my hand at very many sports, including
  boxing, cricket, billiards, motoring, football, aeronautics and skiing,
  having been the first to introduce the latter for long journeys into
  Switzerland. I have travelled as Doctor to a whaler for seven months in the
  Arctic and afterwards in the West Coast of Africa. I have seen something of
  three wars, the Soudanese, the South African and the German. My life has been
  dotted with adventures of all kinds. Finally I have been constrained to
  devote my latter years to telling the world the final result of thirty-six
  years' study of the occult, and in endeavouring to make it realize the
  overwhelming importance of the question. In this mission I have already
  travelled more than 50,000 miles and addressed 300,000 people, besides
  writing seven books upon the subject. Such is the life which I have told in
  some detail in my <i>Memories and Adventures</i>.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-01"
     id="ch-01"></a>I &mdash; EARLY RECOLLECTIONS</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">Extraction&mdash;"H. B."&mdash;Four Remarkable
  Brothers&mdash;My Mother's Family Tree&mdash;An Unrecognized Genius&mdash;My
  First Knockout&mdash;Thackeray&mdash;The Fenians&mdash;Early Reading&mdash;My
  First Story.</p><br>

  <p class="first">I WAS born on May 22, 1859, at Picardy Place, Edinburgh, so
  named because in old days a colony of French Huguenots had settled there. At
  the time of their coming it was a village outside the City walls, but now it
  is at the end of Queen Street, abutting upon Leith Walk. When last I visited
  it, it seemed to have degenerated, but at that time the flats were of good
  repute.</p>

  <p>My father was the youngest son of John Doyle, who under the <i>nom de
  crayon</i> of "H. B." made a great reputation in London from about 1825 to
  1850. He came from Dublin about the year 1815 and may be said to be the
  father of polite caricature, for in the old days satire took the brutal shape
  of making the object grotesque in features and figure. Gilray and Rowlandson
  had no other idea. My grandfather was a gentleman, drawing gentlemen for
  gentlemen, and the satire lay in the wit of the picture and not in the
  mis-drawing of faces. This was a new idea, but it has been followed by most
  caricaturists since and so has become familiar. There were no comic papers in
  those days, and the weekly cartoon of "H. B." was lithographed and
  distributed. He exerted, I am told, quite an influence upon politics, and was
  on terms of intimacy with many of the leading men of the day. I can remember
  him in his old age, a very handsome and dignified man with features of the
  strong Anglo-Irish, Duke of Wellington stamp. He died in 1868.</p>

  <p>My grandfather was left a widower with a numerous family, of which four
  boys and one girl survived. Each of the boys made a name for himself, for all
  inherited the artistic powers of their father. The elder, James Doyle, wrote
  "The Chronicles of England," illustrated with coloured pictures by
  himself&mdash;examples of colour-printing which beat any subsequent work that
  I have ever seen. He also spent thirteen years in doing "The Official
  Baronage of England," a wonderful monument of industry and learning. Another
  brother was Henry Doyle, a great judge of old paintings, and in later years
  the manager of the National Gallery in Dublin, where he earned his C.B. The
  third son was Richard Doyle, whose whimsical humour made him famous in
  "Punch," the cover of which with its dancing elves is still so familiar an
  object. Finally came Charles Doyle, my father.</p>

  <p>The Doyle family seem to have been fairly well-to-do, thanks to my
  grandfather's talents. They lived in London in Cambridge Terrace. A sketch of
  their family life is given in "Dicky Doyle's Diary." They lived up to their
  income, however, and it became necessary to find places for the boys. When my
  father was only nineteen a seat was offered him in the Government Office of
  Works in Edinburgh, whither he went. There he spent his working life, and
  thus it came about that I, an Irishman by extraction, was born in the
  Scottish capital.</p>

  <p>The Doyles, Anglo-Norman in origin, were strong Roman Catholics. The
  original Doyle, or D'Oil, was a cadet-branch of the Staffordshire Doyles,
  which has produced Sir Francis Hastings Doyle and many other distinguished
  men. This cadet shared in the invasion of Ireland and was granted estates in
  County Wexford, where a great clan rose of dependants, illegitimate children
  and others, all taking the feudal lord's name, just as the de Burghs founded
  the clan of Burke. We can only claim to be the main stem by virtue of
  community of character and appearance with the English Doyles and the
  unbroken use of the same crest and coat-of-arms.</p>

  <p>My forbears, like most old Irish families in the south, kept to the old
  faith at the Reformation and fell victims to the penal laws in consequence.
  These became so crushing upon landed gentry that my great-grandfather was
  driven from his estate and became a silk-mercer in Dublin, where "H. B." was
  born. This family record was curiously confirmed by Monsignor Barry Doyle,
  destined, I think, for the highest honours of the Roman Church, who traces
  back to the younger brother of my great-grandfather.</p>

  <p>I trust the reader will indulge me in my excursion into these family
  matters, which are of vital interest to the family, but must be tedious to
  the outsider. As I am on the subject, I wish to say a word upon my mother's
  family, the more so as she was great on archaeology, and had, with the help
  of Sir Arthur Vicars, Ulster King of Arms, and himself a relative, worked out
  her descent for more than five hundred years, and so composed a family tree
  which lies before me as I write and on which many of the great ones of the
  earth have roosted.</p>

  <p>Her father was a young doctor of Trinity College, William Foley, who died
  young and left his family in comparative poverty. He had married one
  Katherine Pack, whose death-bed&mdash;or rather the white waxen thing which
  lay upon that bed&mdash;is the very earliest recollection of my life. Her
  near relative&mdash;uncle, I think&mdash;was Sir Denis Pack, who led the
  Scottish brigade at Waterloo. The Packs were a fighting family, as was but
  right since they were descended in a straight line from a major in Cromwell's
  army who settled in Ireland. One of them, Anthony Pack, had part of his head
  carried off at the same battle, so I fear it is part of our family tradition
  that we lose our heads in action. His brain was covered over by a silver
  plate and he lived for many years, subject only to very bad fits of temper,
  which some of us have had with less excuse.</p>

  <p>But the real romance of the family lies in the fact that about the middle
  of the seventeenth century the Reverend Richard Pack, who was head of
  Kilkenny College, married Mary Percy, who was heir to the Irish branch of the
  Percys of Northumberland. By this alliance we all connect up (and I have
  every generation by name, as marked out by my dear mother) with that
  illustrious line up to three separate marriages with the Plantagenets. One
  has, therefore, some strange strains in one's blood which are noble in origin
  and, one can but hope, are noble in tendency.</p>

    <p class="caption">My Mother, at 17. Drawn by Richard Doyle, July 1854.</p>
  </div>

  <p>But all this romance of ancestry did not interfere with the fact that when
  Katherine Pack, the Irish gentlewoman, came in her widowhood to Edinburgh,
  she was very poor. I have never been clear why it was Edinburgh for which she
  made. Having taken a flat she let it be known that a paying-guest would be
  welcome. Just at this time, 1850 or thereabouts, Charles Doyle was sent from
  London with a recommendation to the priests that they should guard his young
  morals and budding faith. How could they do this better than by finding him
  quarters with a wellborn and orthodox widow? Thus it came about that two
  separate lines of Irish wanderers came together under one roof.</p>

  <p>I have a little bundle of my father's letters written in those days, full
  of appreciation of the kindness which he met with and full, also, of
  interesting observations on that Scottish society, rough, hard-drinking and
  kindly, into which he had been precipitated at a dangerously early age,
  especially for one with his artistic temperament. He had some fine religious
  instincts, but his environment was a difficult one. In the household was a
  bright-eyed, very intelligent younger daughter, Mary, who presently went off
  to France and returned as a very cultivated young woman. The romance is
  easily understood, and so Charles Doyle in the year 1855 married Mary Foley,
  my mother, the young couple still residing with my grandmother.</p>

  <p>Their means were limited, for his salary as a Civil Servant was not more
  than about £240. This he supplemented by his drawings. Thus matters remained
  for practically all his life, for he was quite unambitious and no great
  promotion ever came his way. His painting was done spasmodically and the
  family did not always reap the benefit, for Edinburgh is full of watercolours
  which he had given away. It is one of my unfulfilled schemes to collect as
  many as possible and to have a Charles Doyle exhibition in London, for the
  critics would be surprised to find what a great and original artist he
  was&mdash;far the greatest, in my opinion, of the family. His brush was
  concerned not only with fairies and delicate themes of the kind, but with
  wild and fearsome subjects, so that his work had a very peculiar style of its
  own, mitigated by great natural humour. He was more terrible than Blake and
  less morbid than Wiertz. His originality is best shown by the fact that one
  hardly knows with whom to compare him. In prosaic Scotland, however, he
  excited wonder rather than admiration, and he was only known in the larger
  world of London by pen and ink book-illustrations which were not his best
  mode of expression. The prosaic outcome was that including all his earnings
  my mother could never have averaged more than £300 a year on which to educate
  a large family. We lived in the hardy and bracing atmosphere of poverty and
  we each in turn did our best to help those who were younger than ourselves.
  My noble sister Annette, who died just as the sunshine of better days came
  into our lives, went out at a very early age as a governess to Portugal and
  sent all her salary home. My younger sisters, Lottie and Connie, both did the
  same thing; and I helped as I could. But it was still my dear mother who bore
  the long, sordid strain. Often I said to her, "When you are old, Mammie, you
  shall have a velvet dress and gold glasses and sit in comfort by the fire."
  Thank God, it so came to pass. My father, I fear, was of little help to her,
  for his thoughts were always in the clouds and he had no appreciation of the
  realities of life. The world, not the family, gets the fruits of genius.</p>

  <p>Of my boyhood I need say little, save that it was Spartan at home and more
  Spartan at the Edinburgh school where a tawse-brandishing schoolmaster of the
  old type made our young lives miserable. From the age of seven to nine I
  suffered under this pock-marked, one-eyed rascal who might have stepped from
  the pages of Dickens. In the evenings, home and books were my sole
  consolation, save for week-end holidays. My comrades were rough boys and I
  became a rough boy, too. If there is any truth in the idea of
  reincarnation&mdash;a point on which my mind is still open&mdash;I think some
  earlier experience of mine must have been as a stark fighter, for it came out
  strongly in youth, when I rejoiced in battle. We lived for some time in a
  <i>cul de sac</i> street with a very vivid life of its own and a fierce feud
  between the small boys who dwelt on either side of it. Finally it was fought
  out between two champions, I representing the poorer boys who lived in flats
  and my opponent the richer boys who lived in the opposite villas. We fought
  in the garden of one of the said villas and had an excellent contest of many
  rounds, not being strong enough to weaken each other. When I got home after
  the battle, my mother cried, "Oh, Arthur, what a dreadful eye you have got!"
  To which I replied, "You just go across and look at Eddie Tulloch's eye!"</p>

  <p>I met a well-deserved setback on one occasion when I stood forward to
  fight a bootmaker's boy, who had come into our preserve upon an errand. He
  had a green baize bag in his hand which contained a heavy boot, and this he
  swung against my skull with a force which knocked me pretty well senseless.
  It was a useful lesson. I will say for myself, however, that though I was
  pugnacious I was never so to those weaker than myself and that some of my
  escapades were in the defence of such. As I will show in my chapter on Sport,
  I carried on my tastes into a later period of my life.</p>

  <p>One or two little pictures stand out which may be worth recording. When my
  grandfather's grand London friends passed through Edinburgh they used, to our
  occasional embarrassment, to call at the little flat "to see how Charles is
  getting on." In my earliest childhood such a one came, tall, white-haired and
  affable. I was so young that it seems like a faint dream, and yet it pleases
  me to think that I have sat on Thackeray's knee. He greatly admired my dear
  little mother with her grey Irish eyes and her vivacious Celtic
  ways&mdash;indeed, no one met her without being captivated by her.</p>

  <p>Once, too, I got a glimpse of history. It was in 1866, if my dates are
  right, that some well-to-do Irish relatives asked us over for a few weeks,
  and we passed that time in a great house in King's County. I spent much of it
  with the horses and dogs, and became friendly with the young groom. The
  stables opened on to a country road by an arched gate with a loft over it.
  One morning, being in the yard, I saw the young groom rush into the yard with
  every sign of fear and hastily shut and bar the doors. He then climbed into
  the loft, beckoning to me to come with him. From the loft window we saw a
  gang of rough men, twenty or so, slouching along the road. When they came
  opposite to the gate they stopped and looking up shook their fists and cursed
  at us. The groom answered back most volubly. Afterwards I understood that
  these men were a party of Fenians, and that I had had a glimpse of one of the
  periodical troubles which poor old Ireland has endured. Perhaps now, at last,
  they may be drawing to an end.</p>

  <p>During these first ten years I was a rapid reader, so rapid that some
  small library with which we dealt gave my mother notice that books would not
  be changed more than twice a day. My tastes were boylike enough, for Mayne
  Reid was my favourite author, and his "Scalp Hunters" my favourite book. I
  wrote a little book and illustrated it myself in early days. There was a man
  in it and there was a tiger who amalgamated shortly after they met. I
  remarked to my mother with precocious wisdom that it was easy to get people
  into scrapes, but not so easy to get them out again, which is surely the

  Jesuits&mdash;Strange Arrival in Paris.</p><br>

  <p class="first">I WAS in my tenth year when I was sent to Hodder, which is
  the preparatory school for Stonyhurst, the big Roman Catholic public school
  in Lancashire.</p>

  <p>It was a long journey for a little boy who had never been away from home
  before, and I felt very lonesome and wept bitterly upon the way, but in due
  time I arrived safely at Preston, which was then the nearest station, and
  with many other small boys and our black-robed Jesuit guardians we drove some
  twelve miles to the school. Hodder is about a mile from Stonyhurst, and as
  all the boys there are youngsters under twelve, it forms a very useful
  institution, breaking a lad into school ways before he mixes with the big
  fellows.</p>

  <p>I had two years at Hodder. The year was not broken up by the frequent
  holidays which illuminate the present educational period. Save for six weeks
  each summer, one never left the school. On the whole, those first two years
  were happy years. I could hold my own both in brain and in strength with my
  comrades. I was fortunate enough to get under the care of a kindly principal,
  one Father Cassidy, who was more human than Jesuits usually are. I have
  always kept a warm remembrance of this man and of his gentle ways to the
  little boys&mdash;young rascals many of us&mdash;who were committed to his
  care. I remember the Franco-German War breaking out at this period, and how
  it made a ripple even in our secluded backwater.</p>

  <p>From Hodder I passed on to Stonyhurst, that grand mediaeval dwelling-house
  which was left some hundred and fifty years ago to the Jesuits, who brought
  over their whole teaching staff from some college in Holland in order to
  carry it on as a public school. The general curriculum, like the building,
  was mediaeval but sound. I understand it has been modernized since. There
  were seven classes&mdash;elements, figures, rudiments, grammar, syntax,
  poetry and rhetoric&mdash;and you were allotted a year for each, or seven in
  all&mdash;a course with which I faithfully complied, two having already been
  completed at Hodder. It was the usual public school routine of Euclid,
  algebra and the classics, taught in the usual way, which is calculated to
  leave a lasting abhorrence of these subjects. To give boys a little slab of
  Virgil or Homer with no general idea as to what it is all about or what the
  classical age was like, is surely an absurd way of treating the subject. I am
  sure that an intelligent boy could learn more by reading a good translation
  of Homer for a week than by a year's study of the original as it is usually
  carried out. It was no worse at Stonyhurst than at any other school, and it
  can only be excused on the plea that any exercise, however stupid in itself,
  forms a sort of mental dumbbell by which one can improve one's mind. It is, I
  think, a thoroughly false theory. I can say with truth that my Latin and
  Greek, which cost me so many weary hours, have been little use to me in life,
  and that my mathematics have been no use at all. On the other hand, some
  things which I picked up almost by accident, the art of reading aloud,
  learned when my mother was knitting, or the reading of French books, learned
  by spelling out the captions of the Jules Verne illustrations, have been of
  the greatest possible service. My classical education left me with a horror
  of the classics, and I was astonished to find how fascinating they were when
  I read them in a reasonable manner in later years.</p>

  <p>Year by year, then, I see myself climbing those seven weary steps and
  passing through as many stages of my boyhood. I do not know if the Jesuit
  system of education is good or not; I would need to have tried another system
  as well before I could answer that. On the whole it was justified by results,
  for I think it turned out as decent a set of young fellows as any other
  school would do. In spite of a large infusion of foreigners and some
  disaffected Irish, we were a patriotic crowd, and our little pulse beat time
  with the heart of the nation. I am told that the average of V.C.'s and
  D.S.O.'s now held by old Stonyhurst boys is very high as compared with other
  schools. The Jesuit teachers have no trust in human nature, and perhaps they
  are justified. We were never allowed for an instant to be alone with each
  other, and I think that the immorality which is rife in public schools was at
  a minimum in consequence. In our games and our walks the priests always took
  part, and a master perambulated the dormitories at night. Such a system may
  weaken self-respect and self-help, but it at least minimizes temptation and
  scandal.</p>

  <p>The life was Spartan, and yet we had all that was needed. Dry bread and
  hot well-watered milk was our frugal breakfast. There was a "joint" and twice
  a week a pudding for dinner. Then there was an odd snack called "bread and
  beer" in the afternoon, a bit of dry bread and the most extraordinary drink,
  which was brown but had no other characteristic of beer. Finally, there was
  hot milk again, bread, butter, and often potatoes for supper. We were all
  very healthy on this <i>régime</i>, with fish, on Fridays. Everything in
  every way was plain to the verge of austerity, save that we dwelt in a
  beautiful building, dined in a marble-floored hall with minstrels' gallery,
  prayed in a lovely church, and generally lived in very choice surroundings so
  far as vision and not comfort was concerned.</p>

  <p>Corporal punishment was severe, and I can speak with feeling as I think
  few, if any, boys of my time endured more of it. It was of a peculiar nature,
  imported also, I fancy, from Holland. The instrument was a piece of
  india-rubber of the size and shape of a thick boot sole. This was called a
  "Tolley"&mdash;why, no one has explained, unless it is a Latin pun on what we
  had to bear. One blow of this instrument, delivered with intent, would cause
  the palm of the hand to swell up and change colour. When I say that the usual
  punishment of the larger boys was nine on each hand, and that nine on one
  hand was the absolute minimum, it will be understood that it was a severe
  ordeal, and that the sufferer could not, as a rule, turn the handle of the
  door to get out of the room in which he had suffered. To take twice nine upon
  a cold day was about the extremity of human endurance. I think, however, that
  it was good for us in the end, for it was a point of honour with many of us
  not to show that we were hurt, and that is one of the best trainings for a
  hard life. If I was more beaten than others it was not that I was in any way
  vicious, but it was that I had a nature which responded eagerly to
  affectionate kindness (which I never received), but which rebelled against
  threats and took a perverted pride in showing that it would not be cowed by
  violence. I went out of my way to do really mischievous and outrageous things
  simply to show that my spirit was unbroken. An appeal to my better nature and
  not to my fears would have found an answer at once. I deserved all I got for
  what I did, but I did it because I was mishandled.</p>

  <p>I do not remember any one who attained particular distinction among my
  school-fellows, save Bernard Partridge of "Punch," whom I recollect as a very
  quiet, gentle boy. Father Thurston, who was destined to be one of my
  opponents in psychic matters so many years later, was in the class above me.
  There was a young novice, too, with whom I hardly came in contact, but whose
  handsome and spiritual appearance I well remember. He was Bernard Vaughan,
  afterwards the famous preacher. Save for one school-fellow, James
  Ryan&mdash;a remarkable boy who grew into a remarkable man&mdash;I carried
  away no lasting friendship from Stonyhurst.</p>

  <p>It was only in the latest stage of my Stonyhurst development that I
  realized that I had some literary streak in me which was not common to all.
  It came to me as quite a surprise, and even more perhaps to my masters, who
  had taken a rather hopeless view of my future prospects. One master, when I
  told him that I thought of being a civil engineer, remarked, "Well, Doyle,
  you may be an engineer, but I don't think you will ever be a civil one."
  Another assured me that I would never do any good in the world, and perhaps
  from his point of view his prophecy has been justified. The particular
  incident, however, which brought my latent powers to the surface depended
  upon the fact that in the second highest class, which I reached in 1874, it
  was incumbent to write poetry (so called) on any theme given. This was done
  as a dreary unnatural task by most boys. Very comical their wooings of the
  muses used to be. For one saturated as I really was with affection for verse,
  it was a labour of love, and I produced verses which were poor enough in
  themselves but seemed miracles to those who had no urge in that direction.
  The particular theme was the crossing of the Red Sea by the Israelites and my
  effort from&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">"Like pallid daisies in a grassy wood,<br>
  So round the sward the tents of Israel stood";</p>

  <p>through&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">"There was no time for thought and none for fear,<br>
  For Egypt's horse already pressed their rear";</p>

  <p>down to the climax&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">"One horrid cry! The tragedy was o'er,<br>
  And Pharaoh with his army seen no more,"&mdash;</p>

  <p>was workmanlike though wooden and conventional. Anyhow, it marked what Mr.
  Stead used to call a signpost, and I realized myself a little. In the last
  year I edited the College magazine and wrote a good deal of indifferent
  verse. I also went up for the Matriculation examination of London University,
  a good all-round test which winds up the Stonyhurst curriculum, and I
  surprised every one by taking honours, so after all I emerged from Stonyhurst
  at the age of sixteen with more credit than seemed probable from my rather
  questionable record.</p>

  <p>Early in my career there, an offer had been made to my mother that my
  school fees would be remitted if I were dedicated to the Church. She refused
  this, so both the Church and I had an escape. When I think, however, of her
  small income and great struggle to keep up appearances and make both ends
  meet, it was a fine example of her independence of character, for it meant
  paying out some £50 a year which might have been avoided by a word of
  assent.</p>

  <p>I had yet another year with the Jesuits, for it was determined that I was
  still too young to begin any professional studies, and that I should go to
  Germany and learn German. I was despatched, therefore, to Feldkirch, which is
  a Jesuit school in the Vorarlberg province of Austria, to which many
  better-class German boys are sent. Here the conditions were much more humane
  and I met with far more human kindness than at Stonyhurst, with the immediate
  result that I ceased to be a resentful young rebel and became a pillar of law
  and order.</p>

  <p>I began badly, however, for on the first night of my arrival I was kept
  awake by a boy snoring loudly in the dormitory. I stood it as long as I
  could, but at last I was driven to action. Curious wooden compasses called
  <i>bett-scheere</i>, or "bed-scissors," were stuck into each side of the
  narrow beds. One of these I plucked out, walked down the dormitory, and,
  having spotted the offender, proceeded to poke him with my stick. He awoke
  and was considerably amazed to see in the dim light a large youth whom he had
  never seen before&mdash;I arrived after hours&mdash;assaulting him with a
  club. I was still engaged in stirring him up when I felt a touch on my
  shoulder and was confronted by the master, who ordered me back to bed. Next
  morning I got a lecture on free-and-easy English ways, and taking the law
  into my own hands. But this start was really my worst lapse and I did well in
  the future.</p>

  <p>It was a happy year on the whole. I made less progress with German than I
  should, for there were about twenty English and Irish boys who naturally
  baulked the wishes of their parents by herding together. There was no
  cricket, but there was toboganning and fair football, and a weird
  game&mdash;football on stilts. Then there were the lovely mountains round us,
  with an occasional walk among them. The food was better than at Stonyhurst
  and we had the pleasant German light beer instead of the horrible swipes of
  Stonyhurst. One unlooked-for accomplishment I acquired, for the boy who
  played the big brass bass instrument in the fine school band had not
  returned, and, as a well-grown lad was needed, I was at once enlisted in the
  service. I played in public&mdash;good music, too, "Lohengrin," and
  "Tannhäuser,"&mdash;within a week or two of my first lesson, but they pressed
  me on for the occasion and the Bombardon, as it was called, only comes in on
  a measured rhythm with an occasional run, which sounds like a hippopotamus
  doing a step-dance. So big was the instrument that I remember the other
  bandsmen putting my sheets and blankets inside it and my surprise when I
  could not get out a note. It was in the summer of 1876 that I left Feldkirch,
  and I have always had a pleasant memory of the Austrian Jesuits and of the
  old school.</p>

  <p>Indeed I have a kindly feeling towards all Jesuits, far as I have strayed
  from their paths. I see now both their limitations and their virtues. They
  have been slandered in some things, for during eight years of constant
  contact I cannot remember that they were less truthful than their fellows, or
  more casuistical than their neighbours. They were keen, clean-minded earnest
  men, so far as I knew them, with a few black sheep among them, but not many,
  for the process of selection was careful and long. In all ways, save in their
  theology, they were admirable, though this same theology made them hard and
  inhuman upon the surface, which is indeed the general effect of Catholicism
  in its more extreme forms. The convert is lost to the family. Their hard,
  narrow outlook gives the Jesuits driving power, as is noticeable in the
  Puritans and all hard, narrow creeds. They are devoted and fearless and have
  again and again, both in Canada, in South America and in China, been the
  vanguard of civilization to their own grievous hurt. They are the old guard
  of the Roman Church. But the tragedy is that they, who would gladly give
  their lives for the old faith, have in effect helped to ruin it, for it is
  they, according to Father Tyrrell and the modernists, who have been at the
  back of all those extreme doctrines of papal infallibility and Immaculate
  Conception, with a general all-round tightening of dogma, which have made it
  so difficult for the man with scientific desire for truth or with
  intellectual self-respect to keep within the Church. For some years Sir
  Charles Mivart, the last of Catholic Scientists, tried to do the impossible,
  and then he also had to leave go his hold, so that there is not, so far as I
  know, one single man of outstanding fame in science or in general thought who
  is a practising Catholic. This is the work of the extremists and is deplored
  by many of the moderates and fiercely condemned by the modernists. It depends
  also upon the inner Italian directorate who give the orders. Nothing can
  exceed the uncompromising bigotry of the Jesuit theology, or their apparent
  ignorance of how it shocks the modern conscience. I remember that when, as a
  grown lad, I heard Father Murphy, a great fierce Irish priest, declare that
  there was sure damnation for every one outside the Church, I looked upon him
  with horror, and to that moment I trace the first rift which has grown into
  such a chasm between me and those who were my guides.</p>

  <p>On my way back to England I stopped at Paris. Through all my life up to
  this point there had been an unseen grand-uncle, named Michael Conan, to whom
  I must now devote a paragraph. He came into the family from the fact that my
  father's father ("H. B.") had married a Miss Conan. Michael Conan, her
  brother, had been editor of "The Art Journal" and was a man of distinction,
  an intellectual Irishman of the type which originally founded the Sinn Fein
  movement. He was as keen on heraldry and genealogy as my mother, and he
  traced his descent in some circuitous way from the Dukes of Brittany, who
  were all Conans; indeed Arthur Conan was the ill-fated young Duke whose eyes
  were put out, according to Shakespeare, by King John. This uncle was my
  godfather, and hence my name Arthur Conan.</p>

  <p>He lived in Paris and had expressed a wish that his grand-nephew and
  godson, with whom he had corresponded, should call <i>en passant</i>. I ran
  my money affairs so closely, after a rather lively supper at Strasburg, that
  when I reached Paris I had just twopence in my pocket. As I could not well
  drive up and ask my uncle to pay the cab I left my trunk at the station and
  set forth on foot. I reached the river, walked along it, came to the foot of
  the Champs Elysées, saw the Arc de Triomphe in the distance, and then,
  knowing that the Avenue Wagram, where my uncle lived, was near there, I
  tramped it on a hot August day and finally found him. I remember that I was
  exhausted with the heat and the walking, and that when at the last gasp I saw
  a man buy a drink of what seemed to be porter by handing a penny to a man who
  had a long tin on his back, I therefore halted the man and spent one of my
  pennies on a duplicate drink. It proved to be liquorice and water, but it
  revived me when I badly needed it, and it could not be said that I arrived
  penniless at my uncle's, for I actually had a penny.</p>

  <p>So, for some penurious weeks, I was in Paris with this dear old volcanic
  Irishman, who spent the summer day in his shirt-sleeves, with a little
  dicky-bird of a wife waiting upon him. I am built rather on his lines of body
  and mind than on any of the Doyles. We made a true friendship, and then I
  returned to my home conscious that real life was about to begin.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-03"
     id="ch-03"></a>III &mdash; RECOLLECTIONS OF A STUDENT</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">Edinburgh University&mdash;A Sad
  Disappointment&mdash;Original of Professor Challenger&mdash;Of Sherlock

Holmes&mdash;Deductions&mdash;Sheffield&mdash;Ruyton&mdash;Birmingham&mdash;Lit
  erary Aspirations&mdash;First Accepted Story&mdash;My Father's
  Death&mdash;Mental Position&mdash;Spiritual Yearnings&mdash;An Awkward
  Business.</p><br>

  <p class="first">WHEN I returned to Edinburgh, with little to show, either
  mental or spiritual, for my pleasant school year in Germany, I found that the
  family affairs were still as straitened as ever. No promotion had come to my
  father, and two younger children, Innes, my only brother, and Ida, had
  arrived to add to the calls upon my mother. Another sister, Julia, followed
  shortly afterwards. But Annette, the eldest sister, had already gone out to
  Portugal to earn and send home a fair salary, while Lottie and Connie were
  about to do the same. My mother had adopted the device of sharing a large
  house, which may have eased her in some ways, but was disastrous in
  others.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was good for me that the times were hard, for I was wild,
  full-blooded, and a trifle reckless, but the situation called for energy and
  application, so that one was bound to try to meet it. My mother had been so
  splendid that we could not fail her. It had been determined that I should be
  a doctor, chiefly, I think, because Edinburgh was so famous a centre for
  medical learning. It meant another long effort for my mother, but she was
  very brave and ambitious where her children were concerned, and I was not
  only to have a medical education, but to take the University degree, which
  was a larger matter than a mere licence to practise. When I returned from
  Germany I found that there was a long list of bursaries and scholarships open
  for competition. I had a month in which to brush up my classics and then I
  went in for these, and was informed a week later that I had won the Grierson
  bursary of £40 for two years. Great were the rejoicings and all shadows
  seemed to be lifting. But on calling to get the money I was informed that
  there had been a clerical error, and that this particular bursary was only
  open to arts students. As there was a long list of prizes I naturally
  supposed that I would get the next highest, which was available for medicals.
  The official pulled a long face and said: "Unfortunately the candidate to
  whom it was allotted has already drawn the money." It was manifest robbery,
  and yet I, who had won the prize and needed it so badly, never received it,
  and was eventually put off with a solatium of £7, which had accumulated from
  some fund. It was a bitter disappointment and, of course, I had a legal case,
  but what can a penniless student do, and what sort of college career would he
  have if he began it by suing his University for money? I was advised to
  accept the situation, and there seemed no prospect of accepting anything
  else.</p>

  <p>So now behold me, a tall strongly-framed but half-formed young man, fairly
  entered upon my five years' course of medical study. It can be done with
  diligence in four years, but there came, as I shall show, a glorious
  interruption which held me back for one year. I entered as a student in
  October 1876, and I emerged as a Bachelor of Medicine in August 1881. Between
  these two points lies one long weary grind at botany, chemistry, anatomy,
  physiology, and a whole list of compulsory subjects, many of which have a
  very indirect bearing upon the art of curing. The whole system of teaching,
  as I look back upon it, seems far too oblique and not nearly practical enough
  for the purpose in view. And yet Edinburgh is, I believe, more practical than
  most other colleges. It is practical, too, in its preparation for life, since
  there is none of the atmosphere of an enlarged public school, as is the case
  in English Universities, but the student lives a free man in his own rooms
  with no restrictions of any sort. It ruins some and makes strong men of many.
  In my own case, of course, this did not apply, since my family lived in the
  town, and I worked from my own home.</p>

  <p>There was no attempt at friendship, or even acquaintance, between
  professors and students at Edinburgh. It was a strictly business arrangement
  by which you paid, for example, four guineas for Anatomy lectures and
  received the winter course in exchange, never seeing your professor save
  behind his desk and never under any circumstances exchanging a word with him.
  They were remarkable men, however, some of these professors, and we managed
  to know them pretty well without any personal acquaintance. There was kindly
  Crum Brown, the chemist, who sheltered himself carefully before exploding
  some mixture, which usually failed to ignite, so that the loud "Boom!"
  uttered by the class was the only resulting sound. Brown would emerge from
  his retreat with a "Really, gentlemen!" of remonstrance, and go on without
  allusion to the abortive experiment. There was Wyville Thomson, the
  zoologist, fresh from his <i>Challenger</i> expedition, and Balfour, with the
  face and manner of John Knox, a hard rugged old man, who harried the students
  in their exams, and was in consequence harried by them for the rest of the
  year. There was Turner, a fine anatomist, but a self-educated man, as was
  betrayed when he used to "take and put this structure on the handle of this
  scalpel." The most human trait that I can recall of Turner was that upon one
  occasion the sacred quadrangle was invaded by snowballing roughs. His class,
  of whom I was one, heard the sounds of battle and fidgetted in their seats,
  on which the Professor said: "I think, gentlemen, your presence may be more
  useful outside than here," on which we flocked out with a whoop, and soon had
  the quadrangle clear. Most vividly of all, however, there stands out in my
  memory the squat figure of Professor Rutherford with his Assyrian beard, his
  prodigious voice, his enormous chest and his singular manner. He fascinated
  and awed us. I have endeavoured to reproduce some of his peculiarities in the
  fictitious character of Professor Challenger. He would sometimes start his
  lecture before he reached the classroom, so that we would hear a booming
  voice saying: "There are valves in the veins," or some other information,
  when the desk was still empty. He was, I fear, a rather ruthless vivisector,
  and though I have always recognized that a minimum of painless vivisection is
  necessary, and far more justifiable than the eating of meat as a food, I am
  glad that the law was made more stringent so as to restrain such men as he.
  "Ach, these Jarman Frags!" he would exclaim in his curious accent, as he tore
  some poor amphibian to pieces. I wrote a students' song which is still sung,
  I understand, in which a curious article is picked up on the Portobello beach
  and each Professor in turn claims it for his department. Rutherford's verse
  ran:</p>

  <p class="poem">Said Rutherford with a smile,<br>
  "It's a mass of solid bile,<br>
  And I myself obtained it, what is more,<br>
  By a stringent cholagogue<br>
  From a vivisected dog,<br>
  And I lost it on the Portobello Shore."</p>

  <p>If the song is indeed still sung it may be of interest to the present
  generation to know that I was the author.</p>

  <p>But the most notable of the characters whom I met was one Joseph Bell,
  surgeon at the Edinburgh Infirmary. Bell was a very remarkable man in body
  and mind. He was thin, wiry, dark, with a high-nosed acute face, penetrating
  grey eyes, angular shoulders, and a jerky way of walking. His voice was high
  and discordant. He was a very skilful surgeon, but his strong point was
  diagnosis, not only of disease, but of occupation and character. For some
  reason which I have never understood he singled me out from the drove of
  students who frequented his wards and made me his outpatient clerk, which
  meant that I had to array his outpatients, make simple notes of their cases,
  and then show them in, one by one, to the large room in which Bell sat in
  state surrounded by his dressers and students. Then I had ample chance of
  studying his methods and of noticing that he often learned more of the
  patient by a few quick glances than I had done by my questions. Occasionally
  the results were very dramatic, though there were times when he blundered. In
  one of his best cases he said to a civilian patient: "Well, my man, you've
  served in the army."</p>

  <p>"Aye, sir."</p>

  <p>"Not long discharged?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"A Highland regiment?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, sir."</p>

  <p>"A non-com. officer?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, sir."</p>

  <p>"Stationed at Barbados?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, sir."</p>

  <p>"You see, gentlemen," he would explain, "the man was a respectful man but
  did not remove his hat. They do not in the army, but he would have learned
  civilian ways had he been long discharged. He has an air of authority and he
  is obviously Scottish. As to Barbados, his complaint is elephantiasis, which
  is West Indian and not British." To his audience of Watsons it all seemed
  very miraculous until it was explained, and then it became simple enough. It
  is no wonder that after the study of such a character I used and amplified
  his methods when in later life I tried to build up a scientific detective who
  solved cases on his own merits and not through the folly of the criminal.
  Bell took a keen interest in these detective tales and even made suggestions
  which were not, I am bound to say, very practical. I kept in touch with him
  for many years and he used to come upon my platform to support me when I
  contested Edinburgh in 1901.</p>

  <p>When I took over his out-patient work he warned me that a knowledge of
  Scottish idioms was necessary, and I, with the confidence of youth, declared
  that I had got it. The sequel was amusing. On one of the first days an old
  man came who, in response to my question, declared that he had a "bealin' in
  his oxter."</p>

  <p>This fairly beat me, much to Bell's amusement. It seems that the words
  really mean an abscess in the armpit.</p>

  <p>Speaking generally of my University career I may say that though I took my
  fences in my stride and balked at none of them, still I won no distinction in
  the race. I was always one of the ruck, neither lingering nor gaining&mdash;a
  60 per cent. man at examinations. There were, however, some reasons for this
  which I will now state.</p>

  <p>It was clearly very needful that I should help financially as quickly as
  possible, even if my help only took the humble form of providing for my own
  keep. Therefore I endeavoured almost from the first to compress the classes
  for a year into half a year, and so to have some months in which to earn a
  little money as a medical assistant, who would dispense and do odd jobs for a
  doctor. When I first set forth to do this my services were so obviously worth
  nothing that I had to put that valuation upon them. Even then it might have
  been a hard bargain for the doctor, for I might have proved like the youth in
  "Pickwick" who had a rooted idea that oxalic acid was Epsom salts. However, I
  had horse sense enough to save myself and my employer from any absolute
  catastrophe. My first venture, in the early summer of '78, was with a Dr.
  Richardson, running a low-class practice in the poorer quarters of Sheffield.
  I did my best, and I dare say he was patient, but at the end of three weeks
  we parted by mutual consent. I went on to London, where I renewed my
  advertisements in the medical papers, and found a refuge for some weeks with
  my Doyle relatives, then living at Clifton Gardens, Maida Vale. I fear that I
  was too Bohemian for them and they too conventional for me. However, they
  were kind to me, and I roamed about London for some time with pockets so
  empty that there was little chance of idleness breeding its usual mischief. I
  remember that there were signs of trouble in the East and that the recruiting
  sergeants, who were very busy in Trafalgar Square, took my measure in a
  moment and were very insistent that I should take the shilling. There was a
  time when I was quite disposed to do so, but my mother's plans held me back.
  I may say that late in the same year I did volunteer as a dresser for the
  English ambulances sent to Turkey for the Russian War, and was on the Red
  Cross list, but the collapse of the Turks prevented my going out.</p>

  <p>Soon, however, there came an answer to my advertisement: "Third year's
  student, desiring experience rather than remuneration, offers his services,
  &amp;c., &amp;c." It was from a Dr. Elliot living in a townlet in Shropshire
  which rejoiced in the extraordinary name of "Ruyton-of-the-eleven-towns." It
  was not big enough to make one town, far less eleven. There for four months I
  helped in a country practice. It was a very quiet existence and I had a good
  deal of time to myself under very pleasant circumstances, so that I really
  trace some little mental progress to that period, for I read and thought
  without interruption. My medical duties were of a routine nature save on a
  few occasions. One of them still stands out in my memory, for it was the
  first time in my life that I ever had to test my own nerve in a great sudden
  emergency. The doctor was out when there came a half-crazed messenger to say
  that in some rejoicings at a neighbouring great house they had exploded an
  old cannon which had promptly burst and grievously injured one of the
  bystanders. No doctor was available, so I was the last resource. On arriving
  there I found a man in bed with a lump of iron sticking out of the side of
  his head. I tried not to show the alarm which I felt, and I did the obvious
  thing by pulling out the iron. I could see the clean white bone, so I could
  assure them that the brain had not been injured. I then pulled the gash
  together, staunched the bleeding, and finally bound it up, so that when the
  doctor did at last arrive he had little to add. This incident gave me
  confidence and, what is more important still, gave others confidence. On the
  whole I had a happy time at Ruyton, and have a pleasing memory of Dr. Elliot
  and his wife.</p>

  <p>After a winter's work at the University my next assistantship was a real
  money-making proposition to the extent of some two pounds a month. This was
  with Dr. Hoare, a well-known Birmingham doctor, who had a five-horse City
  practice, and every working doctor, before the days of motors, would realize
  that this meant going from morning to night. He earned some three thousand a
  year, which takes some doing, when it is collected from 3s. 6d. visits and
  1s. 6d. bottles of medicine, among the very poorest classes of Aston. Hoare
  was a fine fellow, stout, square, red-faced, bushy-whiskered and dark-eyed.
  His wife was also a very kindly and gifted woman, and my position in the
  house was soon rather that of a son than of an assistant. The work, however,
  was hard and incessant, and the pay very small. I had long lists of
  prescriptions to make up every day, for we dispensed our own medicine, and
  one hundred bottles of an evening were not unknown. On the whole I made few
  mistakes, though I have been known to send out ointment and pill boxes with
  elaborate directions on the lid and nothing inside. I had my own visiting
  list, also, the poorest or the most convalescent, and I saw a great deal, for
  better or worse, of very low life. Twice I returned to this Birmingham
  practice and always my relations with the family became closer. At my second
  visit my knowledge had greatly extended and I did midwifery cases, and the
  more severe cases in general practice as well as all the dispensing. I had no
  time to spend any money and it was as well, for every shilling was needed at
  home.</p>

  <p>It was in this year that I first learned that shillings might be earned in
  other ways than by filling phials. Some friend remarked to me that my letters
  were very vivid and surely I could write some things to sell. I may say that
  the general aspiration towards literature was tremendously strong upon me,
  and that my mind was reaching out in what seemed an aimless way in all sorts
  of directions. I used to be allowed twopence for my lunch, that being the
  price of a mutton pie, but near the pie shop was a second-hand book shop with
  a barrel full of old books and the legend "Your choice for 2d." stuck above
  it. Often the price of my luncheon used to be spent on some sample out of
  this barrel, and I have within reach of my arm as I write these lines, copies
  of Gordon's Tacitus, Temple's works, Pope's Homer, Addison's Spectator and
  Swift's works, which all came out of the twopenny box. Any one observing my
  actions and tastes would have said that so strong a spring would certainly
  overflow, but for my own part I never dreamed I could myself produce decent
  prose, and the remark of my friend, who was by no means given to flattery,
  took me greatly by surprise. I sat down, however, and wrote a little
  adventure story which I called "The Mystery of the Sassassa Valley." To my
  great joy and surprise it was accepted by "Chambers' Journal," and I received
  three guineas. It mattered not that other attempts failed. I had done it once
  and I cheered myself by the thought that I could do it again. It was years
  before I touched "Chambers'" again, but in 1879 I had a story, "The
  American's Tale," in "London Society," for which also I got a small cheque.
  But the idea of real success was still far from my mind.</p>

  <p>During all this time our family affairs had taken no turn for the better,
  and had it not been for my excursions and for the work of my sisters we could
  hardly have carried on. My father's health had utterly broken, he had to
  retire to that Convalescent Home in which the last years of his life were
  spent, and I, aged twenty, found myself practically the head of a large and
  struggling family. My father's life was full of the tragedy of unfulfilled
  powers and of undeveloped gifts. He had his weaknesses, as all of us have
  ours, but he had also some very remarkable and outstanding virtues. A tall
  man, long-bearded, and elegant, he had a charm of manner and a courtesy of
  bearing which I have seldom seen equalled His wit was quick and playful. He
  possessed, also, a remarkable delicacy of mind which would give him moral
  courage enough to rise and leave any company which talked in a manner which
  was coarse. When he passed away a few years later I am sure that Charles
  Doyle had no enemy in the world, and that those who knew him best sympathized
  most with the hard fate which had thrown him, a man of sensitive genius, into
  an environment which neither his age nor his nature was fitted to face. He
  was unworldly and unpractical and his family suffered for it, but even his
  faults were in some ways the result of his developed spirituality. He lived
  and died a fervent son of the Roman Catholic faith. My mother, however, who
  had never been a very devoted daughter of that great institution, became less
  so as life progressed, and finally found her chief consolation in the
  Anglican fold.</p>

  <p>This brings me to my own spiritual unfolding, if such it may be called,
  during those years of constant struggle. I have already in my account of the
  Jesuits shown how, even as a boy, all that was sanest and most generous in my
  nature rose up against a narrow theology and an uncharitable outlook upon the
  other great religions of the world. In the Catholic Church to doubt anything
  is to doubt everything, for since it Is a vital axiom that doubt is a mortal
  sin when once it has, unbidden and unappeasable, come upon you, everything is
  loosened and you look upon the whole wonderful interdependent scheme with
  other and more critical eyes. Thus viewed there was much to attract&mdash;its
  traditions, its unbroken and solemn ritual, the beauty and truth of many of
  its observances, its poetical appeal to the emotions, the sensual charm of
  music, light and incense, its power as an instrument of law and order. For
  the guidance of an unthinking and uneducated world it could in many ways
  hardly be surpassed, as has been shown in Paraguay, and in the former Ireland
  where, outside agrarian trouble, crime was hardly known. All this I could
  clearly see, but if I may claim any outstanding characteristic in my life, it
  is that I have never paltered or compromised with religious matters, that I
  have always weighed them very seriously, and that there was something in me
  which made it absolutely impossible, even when my most immediate interests
  were concerned, to say anything about them save that which I, in the depth of
  my being, really believed to be true. Judging it thus by all the new
  knowledge which came to me both from my reading and from my studies, I found
  that the foundations not only of Roman Catholicism but of the whole Christian
  faith, as presented to me in nineteenth century theology, were so weak that
  my mind could not build upon them. It is to be remembered that these were the
  years when Huxley, Tyndall, Darwin, Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill were
  our chief philosophers, and that even the man in the street felt the strong
  sweeping current of their thought, while to the young student, eager and
  impressionable, it was overwhelming. I know now that their negative attitude
  was even more mistaken, and very much more dangerous, than the positive
  positions which they attacked with such destructive criticism. A gap had
  opened between our fathers and ourselves so suddenly and completely that when
  a Gladstone wrote to uphold the Gadarene swine, or the six days of Creation,
  the youngest student rightly tittered over his arguments, and it did not need
  a Huxley to demolish them. I can see now very clearly how deplorable it is
  that manifest absurdities should be allowed to continue without even a
  footnote to soften them in the sacred text, because it has the effect that
  what is indeed sacred becomes overlaid, and one can easily be persuaded that
  what is false in parts can have no solid binding force. There are no worse
  enemies of true religion than those who clamour against all revision or
  modification of that strange mass of superbly good and questionable matter
  which we lump all together into a single volume as if there were the same
  value to all of it. It is not solid gold, but gold in clay, and if this be
  understood the earnest seeker will not cast it aside when he comes upon the
  clay, but will value the gold the more in that he has himself separated
  it.</p>

  <p>It was, then, all Christianity, and not Roman Catholicism alone, which had
  alienated my mind and driven me to an agnosticism, which never for an instant
  degenerated into atheism, for I had a very keen perception of the wonderful
  poise of the universe and the tremendous power of conception and sustenance
  which it implied. I was reverent in all my doubts and never ceased to think
  upon the matter, but the more I thought the more confirmed became my
  non-conformity. In a broad sense I was a Unitarian, save that I regarded the
  Bible with more criticism than Unitarians usually show. This negative
  position was so firm that it seemed to me to be a terminus; whereas it proved
  only a junction on the road of life where I was destined to change from the
  old well-worn line on to a new one. Every materialist, as I can now clearly
  see, is a case of arrested development. He has cleared his ruins, but has not
  begun to build that which would shelter him. As to psychic knowledge, I knew
  it only by the account of exposures in the police courts and the usual wild
  and malicious statements in the public press. Years were to pass before I
  understood that in that direction might be found the positive proofs which I
  constantly asserted were the only conditions upon which I could resume any
  sort of allegiance to the unseen. I must have definite demonstration, for if
  it were to be a matter of faith then I might as well go back to the faith of
  my fathers. "Never will I accept anything which cannot be proved to me. The
  evils of religion have all come from accepting things which cannot be
  proved." So I said at the time and I have been true to my resolve.</p>

  <p>I would not give the impression that my life was gloomy or morbidly
  thoughtful because it chanced that I had some extra cares and some worrying
  thoughts. I had an eager nature which missed nothing in the way of fun which
  could be gathered, and I had a great capacity for enjoyment. I read much. I
  played games all I could. I danced, and I sampled the drama whenever I had a
  sixpence to carry me to the gallery. On one occasion I got into a row which
  might have been serious. I was waiting on the gallery steps with a great line
  of people, the shut door still facing us. There were half a dozen soldiers in
  the crowd and one of these squeezed a girl up against the wall in such a way
  that she began to scream. As I was near them I asked the man to be more
  gentle, on which he dug his elbow with all his force into my ribs. He turned
  on me as he did so, and I hit him with both hands in the face. He bored into
  me and pushed me up into the angle of the door, but I had a grip of him and
  he could not hit me, though he tried to kick me in cowardly fashion with his
  knee. Several of his comrades threatened me, and one hit me on the head with
  his cane, cracking my hat. At this moment luckily the door opened and the
  rush of the crowd carried the soldiers on, one sympathetic corporal saying,
  "Take your breath, sir! Take your breath!" I threw my man through the open
  door and came home, for it was clearly asking for trouble if I remained. It
  was a good escape from an awkward business.</p>

  <p>And now I come to the first real outstanding adventure in my life, which
  is worthy of a fresh chapter and of a more elaborate treatment.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-04"
     id="ch-04"></a>IV &mdash; WHALING IN THE ARCTIC OCEAN</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">The "Hope"&mdash;John Gray&mdash;Boxing&mdash;The
  Terrible Mate&mdash;Our Criminal&mdash;First Sight of a Woman&mdash;A
  Hurricane&mdash;Dangers of the Fishing&mdash;Three Dips in the
  Arctic&mdash;The Idlers' Boat&mdash;Whale Taking&mdash;Glamour of the
  Arctic&mdash;Effect of Voyage.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT was in the <i>Hope</i>, under the command of the well-
  known whaler, John Gray, that I paid a seven months' visit to the Arctic Seas
  in the year 1880. I went in the capacity of surgeon, but as I was only twenty
  years of age when I started, and as my knowledge of medicine was that of an
  average third year's student, I have often thought that it was as well that
  there was no very serious call upon my services.</p>

  <p>It came about in this way. One raw afternoon in Edinburgh, whilst I was
  sitting reading hard for one of those examinations which blight the life of a
  medical student, there entered to me one Currie, a fellow-student with whom I
  had some slight acquaintance. The monstrous question which he asked drove all
  thought of my studies out of my head.</p>

  <p>"Would you care," said he, "to start next week for a whaling cruise?
  You'll be surgeon, two pound ten a month and three shillings a ton oil
  money."</p>

  <p>"How do you know I'll get the berth?" was my natural question.</p>

  <p>"Because I have it myself. I find at this last moment that I can't go, and
  I want to get a man to take my place."</p>

  <p>"How about an Arctic kit?"</p>

  <p>"You can have mine."</p>

  <p>In an instant the thing was settled, and within a few minutes the current
  of my life had been deflected into a new channel.</p>

  <p>In little more than a week I was in Peterhead, and busily engaged, with
  the help of the steward, in packing away my scanty belongings in the locker
  beneath my bunk on the good ship <i>Hope</i>.</p>

  <p>I speedily found that the chief duty of the surgeon was to be the
  companion of the captain, who is cut off by the etiquette of the trade from
  anything but very brief and technical talks with his other officers. I should
  have found it intolerable if the captain had been a bad fellow, but John Gray
  of the <i>Hope</i> was a really splendid man, a grand seaman and a
  serious-minded Scot, so that he and I formed a comradeship which was never
  marred during our long <i>tête-à-tête</i>. I see him now, his ruddy face, his
  grizzled hair and beard, his very light blue eyes always looking into far
  spaces, and his erect muscular figure. Taciturn, sardonic, stern on occasion,
  but always a good just man at bottom.</p>

  <p>There was one curious thing about the manning of the <i>Hope</i>. The man
  who signed on as first mate was a little, decrepit, broken fellow, absolutely
  incapable of performing the duties. The cook's assistant, on the other hand,
  was a giant of a man, red-bearded, bronzed, with huge limbs, and a voice of
  thunder. But the moment that the ship cleared the harbour the little,
  decrepit mate disappeared into the cook's galley, and acted as scullery-boy
  for the voyage, while the mighty scullery-boy walked aft and became chief
  mate. The fact was, that the one had the certificate, but was past sailoring,
  while the other could neither read nor write, but was as fine a seaman as
  ever lived; so, by an agreement to which everybody concerned was party, they
  swapped their berths when they were at sea.</p>

  <p>Colin McLean, with his six foot of stature, his erect, stalwart figure,
  and his fierce, red beard, pouring out from between the flaps of his
  sealing-cap, was an officer by natural selection, which is a higher title
  than that of a Board of Trade certificate. His only fault was that he was a
  very hot-blooded man, and that a little would excite him to a frenzy. I have
  a vivid recollection of an evening which I spent in dragging him off the
  steward, who had imprudently made some criticism upon his way of attacking a
  whale which had escaped. Both men had had some rum, which had made the one
  argumentative and the other violent, and as we were all three seated in a
  space of about seven by four, it took some hard work to prevent bloodshed.
  Every now and then, just as I thought all danger was past, the steward would
  begin again with his fatuous, "No offence, Colin, but all I says is that if
  you had been a bit quicker on the fush&mdash;" I don't know how often this
  sentence was begun, but never once was it ended; for at the word "fush" Colin
  always seized him by the throat, and I Colin round the waist, and we
  struggled until we were all panting and exhausted. Then when the steward had
  recovered a little breath he would start that miserable sentence once more,
  and the "fush" would be the signal for another encounter. I really believe
  that if I had not been there the mate would have hurt him, for he was quite
  the angriest man that I have ever seen.</p>

  <p>There were fifty men upon our whaler, of whom half were Scotchmen and half
  Shetlanders, whom we picked up at Lerwick as we passed. The Shetlanders were
  the steadier and more tractable, quiet, decent, and soft-spoken; while the
  Scotch seamen were more likely to give trouble, but also more virile and of
  stronger character. The officers and harpooners were all Scotch, but as
  ordinary seamen, and especially as boatmen, the Shetlanders were as good as
  could be wished.</p>

  <p>There was only one man on board who belonged neither to Scotland nor to
  Shetland, and he was the mystery of the ship. He was a tall, swarthy,
  dark-eyed man, with blue-black hair and beard, singularly handsome features,
  and a curious, reckless sling of his shoulders when he walked. It was
  rumoured that he came from the south of England, and that he had fled thence
  to avoid the law. He made friends with no one, and spoke very seldom, but he
  was one of the smartest seamen in the ship. I could believe from his
  appearance that his temper was Satanic, and that the crime for which he was
  hiding may have been a bloody one. Only once he gave us a glimpse of his
  hidden fires. The cook&mdash;a very burly, powerful man&mdash;the little mate
  was only assistant&mdash;had a private store of rum, and treated himself so
  liberally to it that for three successive days the dinner of the crew was
  ruined. On the third day our silent outlaw approached the cook with a brass
  saucepan in his hand. He said nothing, but he struck the man such a frightful
  blow that his head flew through the bottom and the sides of the pan were left
  dangling round his neck. The half-drunken, half-stunned cook talked of
  fighting, but he was soon made to feel that the sympathy of the ship was
  against him, so he reeled back, grumbling, to his duties while the avenger
  relapsed into his usual moody indifference. We heard no further complaints of
  the cooking.</p>

  <p>I have spoken of the steward, and as I look back at that long voyage,
  during which for seven months we never set foot on land, the kindly open face
  of Jack Lamb comes back to me. He had a beautiful and sympathetic tenor
  voice, and many an hour have I listened to it with its accompaniment of
  rattling plates and jingling knives, as he cleaned up the dishes in his
  pantry. He had a great memory for pathetic and sentimental songs, and it is
  only when you have not seen a woman's face for six months that you realize
  what sentiment means. When Jack trilled out "Her bright smile haunts me
  still," or "Wait for me at Heaven's Gate, sweet Belle Mahone," he filled us
  all with a vague sweet discontent which comes back to me now as I think of
  it. To appreciate a woman one has to be out of sight of one for six months. I
  can well remember that as we rounded the north of Scotland on our return we
  dipped our flag to the lighthouse, being only some hundreds of yards from the
  shore. A figure emerged to answer our salute, and the excited whisper ran
  through the ship, "It's a wumman!" The captain was on the bridge with his
  telescope. I had the binoculars in the bows. Every one was staring. She was
  well over fifty, short skirts and sea boots&mdash;but she was a "wumman."
  "Anything in a mutch!" the sailors used to say, and I was of the same way of
  thinking.</p>

  <p>However, all this has come before its time. It was, I find by my log, on
  February 28 at 2 p.m. that we sailed from Peterhead, amid a great crowd and
  uproar. The decks were as clean as a yacht, and it was very unlike my idea of
  a whaler. We ran straight into bad weather and the glass went down at one
  time to 28.375, which is the lowest reading I can remember in all my ocean
  wanderings. We just got into Lerwick Harbour before the full force of the
  hurricane broke, which was so great that lying at anchor with bare poles and
  partly screened we were blown over to an acute angle. If it had taken us a
  few hours earlier we should certainly have lost our boats&mdash;and the boats
  are the life of a whaler. It was March 11 before the weather moderated enough
  to let us get on, and by that time there were twenty whalers in the bay, so
  that our setting forth was quite an occasion. That night and for a day longer
  the <i>Hope</i> had to take refuge in the lee of one of the outlying islands.
  I got ashore and wandered among peat bogs, meeting strange, barbarous, kindly
  people who knew nothing of the world. I was led back to the ship by a wild,
  long-haired girl holding a torch, for the peat holes make it dangerous at
  night&mdash;I can see her now, her tangled black hair, her bare legs,
  madder-stained petticoat, and wild features under the glare of the torch. I
  spoke to one old man there who asked me the news. I said, "The Tay bridge is
  down," which was then a fairly stale item. He said, "Eh, have they built a
  brig over the Tay?" After that I felt inclined to tell him about the Indian
  Mutiny.</p>

  <p>What surprised me most in the Arctic regions was the rapidity with which
  you reach them. I had never realized that they lie at our very doors. I think
  that we were only four days out from Shetland when we were among the drift
  ice. I awoke one morning to hear the bump, bump of the floating pieces
  against the side of the ship, and I went on deck to see the whole sea covered
  with them to the horizon. They were none of them large, but they lay so thick
  that a man might travel far by springing from one to the other. Their
  dazzling whiteness made the sea seem bluer by contrast, and with a blue sky
  above, and that glorious Arctic air in one's nostrils, it was a morning to
  remember. Once on one of the swaying, rocking pieces we saw a huge seal,
  sleek, sleepy, and imperturbable, looking up with the utmost assurance as if
  it knew that the close time had still three weeks to run. Further on we saw
  on the ice the long human-like prints of a bear. All this with the snowdrops
  of Scotland still fresh in our glasses in the cabin.</p>

  <p>I have spoken about the close time, and I may explain that, by an
  agreement between the Norwegian and British Governments, the subjects of both
  nations are forbidden to kill a seal before April 3. The reason for this is
  that the breeding season is in March, and if the mothers should be killed
  before the young are able to take care of themselves, the race would soon
  become extinct. For breeding purposes the seals all come together at a
  variable spot, which is evidently prearranged among them, and as this place
  can be anywhere within many hundreds of square miles of floating ice, it is
  no easy matter for the fisher to find it. The means by which he sets about it
  are simple but ingenious. As the ship makes its way through the loose
  ice-streams, a school of seals is observed travelling through the water.
  Their direction is carefully taken by compass and marked upon the chart. An
  hour afterwards perhaps another school is seen. This is also marked. When
  these bearings have been taken several times, the various lines upon the
  chart are prolonged until they intersect. At this point, or near it, it is
  likely that the main pack of the seals will be found.</p>

  <p>When you do come upon it, it is a wonderful sight. I suppose it is the
  largest assembly of creatures upon the face of the world&mdash;and this upon
  the open icefields hundreds of miles from the Greenland coast. Somewhere
  between 71 deg. and 75 deg. is the rendezvous, and the longitude is even
  vaguer; but the seals have no difficulty in finding the address. From the
  crow's nest at the top of the main-mast, one can see no end of them. On the
  furthest visible ice one can still see that sprinkling of pepper grains. And
  the young lie everywhere also, snow-white slugs, with a little black nose and
  large dark eyes. Their half-human cries fill the air; and when you are
  sitting in the cabin of a ship which is in the heart of the seal-pack, you
  would think you were next door to a monstrous nursery.</p>

  <p>The <i>Hope</i> was one of the first to find the seal-pack that year, but
  before the day came when hunting was allowed, we had a succession of strong
  gales, followed by a severe roll, which tilted the floating ice and launched
  the young seals prematurely into the water. And so, when the law at last
  allowed us to begin work, Nature had left us with very little work to do.
  However, at dawn upon the third, the ship's company took to the ice, and
  began to gather in its murderous harvest. It is brutal work, though not more
  brutal than that which goes on to supply every dinner-table in the country.
  And yet those glaring crimson pools upon the dazzling white of the icefields,
  under the peaceful silence of a blue Arctic sky, did seem a horrible
  intrusion. But an inexorable demand creates an inexorable supply, and the
  seals, by their death, help to give a living to the long line of seamen,
  dockers, tanners, curers, triers, chandlers, leather merchants, and
  oil-sellers, who stand between this annual butchery on the one hand, and the
  exquisite, with his soft leather boots, or the savant, using a delicate oil
  for his philosophical instruments, upon the other.</p>

  <p>I have cause to remember that first day of sealing on account of the
  adventures which befell me. I have said that a strong swell had arisen, and
  as this was dashing the floating ice together the captain thought it
  dangerous for an inexperienced man to venture upon it. And so, just as I was
  clambering over the bulwarks with the rest, he ordered me back and told me to
  remain on board. My remonstrances were useless, and at last, in the blackest
  of tempers, I seated myself upon the top of the bulwarks, with my feet
  dangling over the outer side, and there I nursed my wrath, swinging up and
  down with the roll of the ship. It chanced, however, that I was really seated
  upon a thin sheet of ice which had formed upon the wood, and so when the
  swell threw her over to a particularly acute angle, I shot off and vanished
  into the sea between two ice-blocks. As I rose, I clawed on to one of these,
  and soon scrambled on board again. The accident brought about what I wished,
  however, for the captain remarked that as I was bound to fall into the ocean
  in any case, I might just as well be on the ice as on the ship. I justified
  his original caution by falling in twice again during the day, and I finished
  it ignominiously by having to take to my bed while all my clothes were drying
  in the engine-room. I was consoled for my misfortunes by finding that they
  amused the captain to such an extent that they drove the ill-success of our
  sealing out of his head, and I had to answer to the name of "the great
  northern diver" for a long time thereafter. I had a narrow escape once
  through stepping backwards over the edge of a piece of floating ice while I
  was engaged in skinning a seal. I had wandered away from the others, and no
  one saw my misfortune. The face of the ice was so even that I had no purchase
  by which to pull myself up, and my body was rapidly becoming numb in the
  freezing water. At last, however, I caught hold of the hind flipper of the
  dead seal, and there was a kind of nightmare tug-of-war, the question being
  whether I should pull the seal off or pull myself on. At last, however, I got
  my knee over the edge and rolled on to it. I remember that my clothes were as
  hard as a suit of armour by the time I reached the ship, and that I had to
  thaw my crackling garments before I could change them.</p>

  <p>This April sealing is directed against the mothers and young. Then, in
  May, the sealer goes further north, and about latitude 77 deg. or 78 deg. he
  comes upon the old male seals, who are by no means such easy victims. They
  are wary creatures, and it takes good long-range shooting to bag them. Then,
  in June, the sealing is over, and the ship bears away further north still,
  until in the 79th or 80th degree she is in the best Greenland whaling
  latitudes. There we stayed for three months or so, with very varying
  fortunes, for though we pursued many whales, only four were slain.</p>

  <p>There are eight boats on board a whaler, but it is usual to send out only
  seven, for it takes six men to man each, so that when seven are out no one is
  left on board save the so-called "idlers" who have not signed to do seaman's
  work at all. It happened, however, that aboard the <i>Hope</i> the idlers
  were rather a hefty crowd, so we volunteered to man the odd boat, and we made
  it, in our own estimation at least, one of the most efficient, both in
  sealing and in whaling. The steward, the second engineer, the donkey-engine
  man, and I were the oars, with a red-headed Highlander for harpooner and the
  handsome outlaw to steer. Our tally of seals was high, and in whaling we were
  once the lancing and once the harpooning boat, so our record was good. So
  congenial was the work to me that Captain Gray was good enough to offer to
  make me harpooner as well as surgeon, with the double pay, if I would come
  with him on a second voyage. It is well that I refused, for the life is
  dangerously fascinating.</p>

  <p>It is exciting work pulling on to a whale. Your own back is turned to him,
  and all you know about him is what you read upon the face of the
  boat-steerer. He is staring out over your head, watching the creature as it
  swims slowly through the water, raising his hand now and again as a signal to
  stop rowing when he sees that the eye is coming round, and then resuming the
  stealthy approach when the whale is end on. There are so many floating pieces
  of ice, that as long as the oars are quiet the boat alone will not cause the
  creature to dive. So you creep slowly up, and at last you are so near that
  the boat-steerer knows that you can get there before the creature has time to
  dive&mdash;for it takes some little time to get that huge body into motion.
  You see a sudden gleam in his eyes, and a flush in his cheeks, and it's "Give
  way, boys! Give way, all Hard!" Click goes the trigger of the big harpoon
  gun, and the foam flies from your oars. Six strokes, perhaps, and then with a
  dull greasy squelch the bows run upon something soft, and you and your oars
  are sent flying in every direction. But little you care for that, for as you
  touched the whale you have heard the crash of the gun, and know that the
  harpoon has been fired point-blank into the huge, lead-coloured curve of its
  side. The creature sinks like a stone, the bows of the boat splash down into
  the water again, but there is the little red Jack flying from the centre
  thwart to show that you are fast, and there is the line whizzing swiftly
  under the seats and over the bows between your outstretched feet.</p>

  <p>And this is the great element of dancer&mdash;for it is rarely indeed that
  the whale has spirit enough to turn upon its enemies. The line is very
  carefully coiled by a special man named the line-coiler, and it is warranted
  not to kink. If it should happen to do so, however, and if the loop catches
  the limbs of any one of the boat's crew, that man goes to his death so
  rapidly that his comrades hardly know that he has gone. It is a waste of fish
  to cut the line, for the victim is already hundreds of fathoms deep.</p>

  <p>"Haud your hand, mon," cried the harpooner, as a seaman raised his knife
  on such an occasion. "The fush will be a fine thing for the widdey." It
  sounds callous, but there was philosophy at the base of it.</p>

  <p>This is the harpooning, and that boat has no more to do. But the lancing,
  when the weary fish is killed with the cold steel, is a more exciting because
  it is a more prolonged experience. You may be for half an hour so near to the
  creature that you can lay your hand upon its slimy side. The whale appears to
  have but little sensibility to pain, for it never winces when the long lances
  are passed through its body. But its instinct urges it to get its tail to
  work on the boats, and yours urges you to keep poling and boat-hooking along
  its side, so as to retain your safe position near its shoulder. Even there,
  however, we found on one occasion that we were not quite out of danger's way,
  for the creature in its flurry raised its huge side-flapper and poised it
  over the boat. One flap would have sent us to the bottom of the sea, and I
  can never forget how, as we pushed our way from under, each of us held one
  hand up to stave off that great, threatening fin&mdash;as if any strength of
  ours could have availed if the whale had meant it to descend. But it was
  spent with loss of blood, and instead of coming down the fin rolled over the
  other way, and we knew that it was dead. Who would swap that moment for any
  other triumph that sport can give?</p>

  <p>The peculiar other-world feeling of the Arctic regions&mdash;a feeling so
  singular that if you have once been there the thought of it haunts you all
  your life&mdash;is due largely to the perpetual daylight. Night seems more
  orange-tinted and subdued than day, but there is no great difference. Some
  captains have been known to turn their hours right round out of caprice, with
  breakfast at night and supper at ten in the morning. There are your
  twenty-four hours, and you may carve them as you like. After a month or two
  the eyes grow weary of the eternal light, and you appreciate what a soothing
  thing our darkness is. I can remember as we came abreast of Iceland, on our
  return, catching our first glimpse of a star, and being unable to take my
  eyes from it, it seemed such a dainty little twinkling thing. Half the
  beauties of Nature are lost through over-familiarity.</p>

  <p>Your sense of loneliness also heightens the effect of the Arctic Seas.
  When we were in whaling latitudes it is probable that, with the exception of
  our consort, there was no vessel within 800 miles of us. For seven long
  months no letter and no news came to us from the southern world. We had left
  in exciting times. The Afghan campaign had been undertaken, and war seemed
  imminent with Russia. We returned opposite the mouth of the Baltic without
  any means of knowing whether some cruiser might not treat us as we had
  treated the whales. When we met a fishing-boat at the north of Shetland our
  first inquiry was as to peace or war. Great events had happened during those
  seven months: the defeat of Maiwand and the famous march of Roberts from
  Cabul to Candahar. But it was all haze to us; and, to this day, I have never
  been able to get that particular bit of military history straightened out in
  my own mind.</p>

  <p>The perpetual light, the glare of the white ice, the deep blue of the
  water, these are the things which one remembers most clearly, and the dry,
  crisp, exhilarating air, which makes mere life the keenest of pleasures. And
  then there are the innumerable sea-birds, whose call is for ever ringing in
  your ears&mdash;the gulls, the fulmars, the snow-birds, the burgomasters, the
  looms, and the rotjes. These fill the air, and below, the waters are for ever
  giving you a peep of some strange new creature. The commercial whale may not
  often come your way, but his less valuable brethren abound on every side. The
  finner shows his 90 feet of worthless tallow, with the absolute conviction
  that no whaler would condescend to lower a boat for him. The mis-shapen
  hunchback whale, the ghost-like white whale, the narwhal, with his unicorn
  horn, the queer-looking bottle-nose, the huge, sluggish, Greenland shark, and
  the terrible killing grampus, the most formidable of all the monsters of the
  deep,&mdash;these are the creatures who own those unsailed seas. On the ice
  are the seals, the saddle-backs, the ground seals and the huge bladdernoses,
  12 feet from nose to tail, with the power of blowing up a great blood-red
  football upon their noses when they are angry, which they usually are.
  Occasionally one sees a white Arctic fox upon the ice, and everywhere are the
  bears. The floes in the neighbourhood of the sealing-ground are all
  criss-crossed with their tracks&mdash;poor harmless creatures, with the lurch
  and roll of a deep-sea mariner. It is for the sake of the seals that they
  come out over those hundreds of miles of ice; and they have a very ingenious
  method of catching them, for they will choose a big icefield with just one
  blow-hole for seals in the middle of it. Here the bear will squat, with its
  powerful forearms crooked round the hole. Then, when the seal's head pops up,
  the great paws snap together, and Bruin has got his luncheon. We used
  occasionally to burn some of the cook's refuse in the engine-room fires, and
  the smell would, in a few hours, bring up every bear for many miles to
  leeward of us.</p>

  <p>Though twenty or thirty whales have been taken in a single year in the
  Greenland seas, it is probable that the great slaughter of last century has
  diminished their number until there are not more than a few hundreds in
  existence. I mean, of course, of the right whale, for the others, as I have
  said, abound. It is difficult to compute the numbers of a species which comes
  and goes over great tracts of water and among huge icefields, but the fact
  that the same whale is often pursued by the same whaler upon successive trips
  shows how limited their number must be. There was one, I remember, which was
  conspicuous through having a huge wart, the size and shape of a beehive, upon
  one of the flukes of its tail. "I've been after that fellow three times,"
  said the captain, as we dropped our boats. "He got away in '71. In '74 we had
  him fast, but the harpoon drew. In '76 a fog saved him. It's odds that we
  have him now!" I fancied that the betting lay rather the other way myself,
  and so it proved, for that warty tail is still thrashing the Arctic seas for
  all that I know to the contrary.</p>

  <p>I shall never forget my own first sight of a right whale. It had been seen
  by the look-out on the other side of a small icefield, but had sunk as we all
  rushed on deck. For ten minutes we awaited its reappearance, and I had taken
  my eyes from the place, when a general gasp of astonishment made me glance
  up, and there was the whale <i>in the air</i>. Its tail was curved just as a
  trout's is in jumping, and every bit of its glistening lead-coloured body was
  clear of the water. It was little wonder that I should be astonished, for the
  captain, after thirty voyages, had never seen such a sight. On catching it we
  discovered that it was very thickly covered with a red, crab-like parasite,
  about the size of a shilling, and we conjectured that it was the irritation
  of these creatures which had driven it wild. If a man had short, nailless
  flippers, and a prosperous family of fleas upon his back, he would appreciate
  the situation.</p>

  <p>Apart from sport, there is a glamour about those circum-polar regions
  which must affect everyone who has penetrated to them. My heart goes out to
  that old, grey-headed whaling captain who, having been left for an instant
  when at death's door, staggered off in his night gear, and was found by
  nurses far from his house and still, as he mumbled, "pushing to the norrard."
  So an Arctic fox, which a friend of mine endeavoured to tame, escaped, and
  was caught many months afterwards in a gamekeeper's trap in Caithness. It was
  also pushing norrard, though who can say by what strange compass it took its
  bearings? It is a region of purity, of white ice and of blue water, with no
  human dwelling within a thousand miles to sully the freshness of the breeze
  which blows across the icefields. And then it is a region of romance also.
  You stand on the very brink of the unknown, and every duck that you shoot
  bears pebbles in its gizzard which come from a land which the maps know not.
  It was a strange and fascinating chapter of my life.</p>

  <p>I went on board the whaler a big, straggling youth, I came off it a
  powerful, well-grown man. I have no doubt that my physical health during my
  whole life has been affected by that splendid air, and that the inexhaustible
  store of energy which I have enjoyed is to some extent drawn from the same
  source. It was mental and spiritual stagnation, or even worse, for there is a
  coarsening effect in so circumscribed a life with comrades who were fine,
  brave fellows, but naturally rough and wild. However I had my health to show
  for it, and also more money than I had ever possessed before. I was still
  boyish in many ways, and I remember that I concealed gold pieces in every
  pocket of every garment, that my mother might have the excitement of hunting
  for them. It added some fifty pounds to her small exchequer.</p>

  <p>Now I had a straight run in to my final examination, which I passed with
  fair but not notable distinction at the end of the winter session of 1881. I
  was now a Bachelor of Medicine and a Master of Surgery, fairly launched upon
  my professional career.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-05"
     id="ch-05"></a>V &mdash; THE VOYAGE TO WEST AFRICA</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">The "Mayumba"&mdash;Fearful Weather&mdash;An
  Escape&mdash;Hanno's Voyage&mdash;Atlantis&mdash;A Land of
  Death&mdash;Blackwater Fever&mdash;Strange
  Fish&mdash;Missionaries&mdash;Danger of Luxury&mdash;A Foolish Swim&mdash;The
  Ship on Fire&mdash;England once more.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT had always been my intention to take a voyage as ship's
  surgeon when I had taken my degree, as I could in this way see something of
  the world, and at the same time earn a little of the money which I so badly
  needed if I were ever to start in practice for myself. When a man is in the
  very early twenties he will not be taken seriously as a practitioner, and
  though I looked old for my age, it was clear that I had to fill in my time in
  some other way. My plans were all exceedingly fluid, and I was ready to join
  the Army, Navy, Indian Service or anything which offered an opening. I had no
  reason to think that I would find a billet upon a passenger ship and had
  nearly forgotten that I had my name down, when I suddenly received a telegram
  telling me to come to Liverpool and to take medical charge of the African
  Steam Navigation Company's <i>Mayumba</i>, bound for the West Coast. In a
  week I was there, and on October 22, 1881, we started on our voyage.</p>

  <p>The <i>Mayumba</i> was a trim little steamer of about 4,000 tons&mdash;a
  giant after my experience in the 200-ton whaler. She was built for commerce,
  carrying mixed cargoes to the coast and coming back with palm oil in
  puncheons, palm nuts in bulk, ivory and other tropical products. What with
  whale oil and palm oil there certainly seemed to be something greasy about my
  horoscope. There was room for twenty or thirty passengers, and it was for
  their behoof that I was paid some £12 a month.</p>

  <p>It was well that we were seaworthy, for we put out in a violent gale,
  which became so bad as we emerged from the Mersey that we were forced into
  Holyhead for the night. Next day, in vile and thick weather, with a strong
  sea running, we made our way down the Irish Sea. I shall always believe that
  I may have saved the ship from disaster, for as I was standing near the
  officer of the watch I suddenly caught sight of a lighthouse standing out in
  a rift in the fog. It was on the port side and I could not imagine how any
  lighthouse could be on the port side of a ship which was, as I knew, well
  down on the Irish coast. I hate to be an alarmist, so I simply touched the
  mate's sleeve, pointed to the dim outline of the lighthouse, and said: "Is
  that all right?" He fairly jumped as his eye lit upon it and he gave a yell
  to the men at the wheel and rang a violent signal to the engine-room. The
  lighthouse, if I remember right, was the Ti kar, and we were heading right
  into a rocky promontory which was concealed by the rain and fog.</p>

  <p>I have been lucky in my captains, for Captain Gordon Wallace was one of
  the best, and we have kept in touch during the later years. Our passengers
  were mostly for Madeira, but there were some pleasant ladies bound for the
  Coast, and some unpleasant negro traders whose manners and bearing were
  objectionable, but who were patrons of the line and must, therefore, be
  tolerated. Some of these palm oil chiefs and traders have incomes of many
  thousands a year, but as they have no cultivated tastes they can only spend
  their money on drink, debauchery and senseless extravagance. One of them, I
  remember, had a choice selection of the demimonde of Liverpool to see him
  off.</p>

  <p>The storms followed us all the way down the Channel and across the Bay,
  which is normal, I suppose, at such a time of year. Everyone was seasick, so
  as doctor T had some work to do. However, before we reached Madeira we ran
  into fine weather and all our troubles were soon forgotten. One never
  realizes the comfort of a dry deck until one has been ankle-deep for a week.
  I missed the sea-boots and rough-and-ready dress of the whaler, for when one
  is in blue serge and gilt buttons one does not care to take a ducking. Just
  as we thought, however, that we were all right a worse gale than ever broke
  over us, the wind luckily being behind us, so that it helped us on our way.
  With jib, trysail and main staysail, which was as much as we could stand, we
  lurched and staggered, swept every now and then by the big Atlantic combers,
  which were phosphorescent at night, so that flames of liquid fire came
  coursing down the decks. Very glad we were when after a week of storm we saw
  the rugged peaks of Porto Santo, an outlier of Madeira, and finally came to
  anchor in Funchal Bay. It was dark when we reached our moorings and it was
  good to see the lights of the town, and the great dark loom of the hills
  behind it. A lunar rainbow spanned the whole scene, a rare phenomenon which I
  have never seen before or since.</p>

  <p>Teneriffe was our next stopping-place, Santa Cruz being the port of call.
  In those days it did a great trade in cochineal, which was derived from an
  insect cultivated on the cacti. When dried they furnished the dye, and a
  packet of the creatures averaged £350 at that time, but now I suppose that
  the German aniline dyes have killed the trade as completely as whaling has
  been killed by the mineral. A day later we were at Las Palmas, capital of
  Grand Canary, whence, looking back, we had a fine view of the famous
  Teneriffe Peak some 60 miles away. Leaving Las Palmas we were in the
  delightful region of the northeast trade-winds, the most glorious part of the
  ocean, seldom rough, yet always lively, with foam-capped seas and a clear
  sky. Day by day it grew hotter, however, and when we lost the Trades, and
  sighted the Isle de Los off the Sierra Leone coast, I began to realize what
  the Tropics meant. When you feel your napkin at meals to be an intolerable
  thing, and when you find that it leaves a wet weal across your white duck
  trousers, then you know that you really have arrived.</p>

  <p>On November 9 we reached Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, our first
  port of call upon the African Main&mdash;a lovely spot but a place of death.
  Here our ladies left us, and indeed it was sad to see them go, for female
  lives are even shorter than male upon the coast. I speak of the days of
  malaria and blackwater fever, before Ronald Ross and others had done their
  great work of healing and prevention. It was a truly dreadful place in the
  early eighties, and the despair which reigned in the hearts of the white
  people made them take liberties with alcohol which they would not have dared
  to take in a healthier place. A year's residence seemed to be about the limit
  of human endurance. I remember meeting one healthy-looking resident who told
  me that he had been there three years. When I congratulated him he shook his
  head. "I am a doomed man. I have advanced Bright's disease," said he. One
  wondered whether the colonies were really worth the price we had to pay.</p>

  <p>From Sierra Leone we steamed to Monrovia, which is the capital of the
  negro republic of Liberia, which, as the name implies, was founded mainly by
  escaped slaves. So far as I could see it was orderly enough, though all small
  communities which take themselves seriously have a comic aspect. Thus at the
  time of the Franco-German War, Liberia is said to have sent out its single
  Customs boat, which represented its official Navy, and stopped the British
  mail-ship in order to send word to Europe that it did not intend to interfere
  in the matter.</p>

  <p>It is a very monotonous view, for whether it is the Ivory Coast or the
  Gold Coast, or the Liberian shore, it always presents the same
  features&mdash;burning sunshine, a long swell breaking into a white line of
  surf, a margin of golden sand, and then the low green bush, with an
  occasional palm tree rising above it. If you have seen a mile, you have seen
  a thousand. As I write now, these ports at which we stopped, Grand Bassam,
  Cape Palmas, Accra, Cape Coast Castle, all form the same picture in my mind.
  One incident only I can remember. At some small village, the name of which I
  have forgotten, there came off a tall young Welshman in a state of furious
  excitement; his niggers had mutinied and he was in fear of his life. "There
  they are waiting for me!" he cried, and pointed to a dusky group upon the
  distant beach. We offered to take him on, but he could not leave his
  property, so all we could do was to promise to send a gunboat up from Cape
  Coast Castle. I have often wondered how such people got on after the German
  menace compelled us to draw in all our outlying fleets.</p>

  <p>This coast is dotted at night with native fires, some of them of great
  extent, arising no doubt from their habit of burning the grass. It is
  interesting that in Hanno's account of his journey down the coast&mdash;the
  only piece of Carthaginian literature which has reached us&mdash;he talks
  also of the fires which he saw at night. As he speaks of gorillas it is
  probable that he got as far as the Gaboon, or south of the Line. He saw great
  volcanic activity, and the remains of it is still visible at Fernando Po,
  which is almost all volcanic. In Hanno's time, however, the hills were
  actually spouting fire and the country was a sea of flame, so that he dare
  not set foot on shore. I have wondered sometimes whether the last cataclysm
  at Atlantis may not have been much later than we think. The account of Plato
  puts it at about 9000 B.C., but it may well have been a gradual thing and the
  last spasm have been that of which Hanno saw the traces. All this activity
  which he described is exactly opposite the spot where the old continent was
  supposed to have been.</p>

  <p>Our ships have rough-and-ready ways as they jog down the coast. Once we
  moved on while a hundred native visitors were still on board. It was funny to
  see them dive off and make for their canoes. One of them had a tall hat, an
  umbrella, and a large coloured picture of the Saviour&mdash;all of which he
  had bought at the trading booths which the men rig up in the forecastle.
  These impedimenta did not prevent him from swimming to his boat. At another
  minor port, since we were pressed for time, we simply threw our consignment
  of barrel staves overboard, knowing that soon or late they would wash up on
  the beach, though how the real owner could make good his claim to them I do
  not know. Occasionally the native scores in this game. Some years ago, before
  Dahomey was annexed by the French, the captain took the oil casks on board at
  Whydah by means of a long rope and a donkey engine, an ingenious way of
  avoiding the surf, which came to a sudden stop when a company of the famous
  Amazons appeared and threatened to fire upon the ship if they did not pay
  their dues to the surf boats in the ordinary fashion.</p>

  <p>I had myself to pay my dues to the climate, for on November 18 I find an
  eloquent gap in my diary. We had reached Lagos, and there, rolling in a
  greasy swell off that huge lagoon, the germ or the mosquito or whatever it
  was reached me and I was down with a very sharp fever. I remember staggering
  to my bunk and then all was blotted out. As I was myself doctor there was no
  one to look after me and I lay for several days fighting it out with Death in
  a very small ring and without a second. It speaks well for my constitution
  that I came out a victor. I remember no psychic experience, no vision, no
  fears, nothing save a nightmare fog from which I emerged as weak as a child.
  It must have been a close call, and I had scarcely sat up before I heard that
  another victim who got it at the same time was dead.</p>

  <p>A week later found me, convalescent and full of energy once more, up the
  Bonny River, which certainly never got its name from the Scotch adjective,
  for it is in all ways hateful with its brown smelling stream and its mango
  swamps. The natives were all absolute savages, offering up human sacrifices
  to sharks and crocodiles. The captain had heard the screams of the victims
  and seen them dragged down to the water's edge, while on another occasion he
  had seen the protruding skull of a man who had been buried in an ant-heap. It
  is all very well to make game of the missionaries, but how could such people
  ever be improved if it were not for the labours of devoted men?</p>

  <p>We called at Fernando Po, and later at Victoria, a lovely little
  settlement upon the Main, with the huge peak of the Cameroons rising behind
  it. A dear homely Scotch lassie was playing the part of missionary there, and
  if she did not evangelize she at least civilized, which is more important. It
  lies in a beautiful bay studded with islands and well wooded all round. For
  some reason the whole style of the scenery changes completely here, and it is
  the more welcome after the thousand miles of monotony to the north. All this
  land went, for some reason, to Germany later, and has now reverted to the
  French, who are not, as a rule, good Colonial neighbours. I went ashore at
  Victoria, and I cannot forget my thrill when what I thought was a good-sized
  blue bird passed me and I found that it was a butterfly.</p>

  <p>To reach Old Calabar we had to steam for 60 miles up the Old Calabar
  River, the channel lying so near the shore that we brushed the trees on one
  side. I lay in wait with my rifle, but though I saw the swirl of several
  alligators none emerged. Old Calabar seemed the largest and most prosperous
  place we had visited, but here also the hand of death was over all, and it
  was "eat, drink, and be merry" for the old and unsatisfactory reason. Here
  again we met one of these young lady pioneers of civilization. Civilization
  is the better, but it is a stern and dreadful call which summons a woman to
  such a work.</p>

  <p>Getting a canoe, I ascended the river for several miles to a place called
  Creektown. Dark and terrible mangrove swamps lay on either side with gloomy
  shades where nothing that is not horrible could exist. It is indeed a foul
  place. Once in an isolated tree, standing in a flood, I saw an evil-looking
  snake, worm-coloured and about 3 feet long. I shot him and saw him drift down
  stream. I learned later in life to give up killing animals, but I confess
  that I have no particular compunctions about that one. Creektown is in native
  territory, and the King sent down a peremptory order that we should report
  ourselves to him, but as it sounded ominous and might mean a long delay we
  got our paddles out and were soon back in British waters.</p>

  <p>I had a curious experience one morning. A large ribbon-shaped fish, about
  3 or 4 feet long, came up and swam upon the surface near the ship. Having my
  gun handy, I shot it. I don't think five seconds could have elapsed before
  another larger and thicker fish&mdash;a big catfish, I should
  say&mdash;darted up from the depths, seized the wounded fish by the middle,
  and dragged it down. So murderous is the food-search, and so keen the watch
  in Nature! I saw something similar in the mixed tank of an aquarium once,
  where a fish stunned himself by swimming against the glass front, and was
  instantly seized and devoured by his neighbour. A strange fish to which I was
  introduced at Calabar was the electrical torpedo fish. It is handed to you in
  an earthenware saucer&mdash;a quiet little drab creature about 5 inches
  long&mdash;and you are asked to tickle its back. Then you learn exactly how
  high you can jump.</p>

  <p>The death-like impression of Africa grew upon me. One felt that the white
  man with his present diet and habits was an intruder who was never meant to
  be there, and that the great sullen brown continent killed him as one crushes
  nits. I find in my diary:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Oh Africa, where are the charms<br>
  That sages have seen in thy face?<br>
  Better dwell in Old England on alms<br>
  Than be rich in that terrible place."</p>

  <p>The life aboard ship, however, was an easy and, in some ways, a luxurious
  one&mdash;too luxurious for a young man who had his way to make in the world.
  Premature comfort is a deadly enervating thing. I remember considering my own
  future&mdash;I stood upon the poop with a raging thunderstorm around
  me&mdash;and seeing very clearly that one or two more such voyages would sap
  my simple habits and make me unfit for the hard struggle which any sort of
  success would need. The idea of success in literature had never crossed my
  mind. It was still of medicine only that I thought, but I knew by my
  Birmingham experience how long and rough a path it was for those who had no
  influence and could not afford to buy. Then and there I vowed that I would
  wander no more, and that was surely one of the turning-points of my life. A
  "Wander-Jahr" is good, but two "Wander-Jahre" may mean damnation&mdash;and it
  is hard to stop. I find that on the same day of fruitful meditation I swore
  off alcohol for the rest of the voyage. I drank quite freely at this period
  of my life, having a head and a constitution which made me fairly immune, but
  my reason told me that the unbounded cocktails of West Africa were a danger,
  and with an effort I cut them out. There is a certain subtle pleasure in
  abstinence, and it is only socially that it is difficult. If we were all
  abstainers as a matter of course, like the real Mahomedans, none of us would
  ever miss it.</p>

  <p>I did a mad thing at Cape Coast Castle, for, in a spirit either of bravado
  or pure folly, I swam round the ship&mdash;or at least for some length along
  her and back again. I suppose it was the consideration that black folk go
  freely into the water which induced me to do it. For some reason white folk
  do not share the same immunity. As I was drying myself on deck I saw the
  triangular back fin of a shark rise to the surface. Several times in my life
  I have done utterly reckless things with so little motive that I have found
  it difficult to explain them to myself afterwards. This was one of them.</p>

  <p>The most intelligent and well-read man whom I met on the Coast was a
  negro, the American Consul at Monrovia. He came on with us as a passenger. My
  starved literary side was eager for good talk, and it was wonderful to sit on
  deck discussing Bancroft and Motley, and then suddenly realize that you were
  talking to one who had possibly been a slave himself, and was certainly the
  son of slaves. He had thought a good deal about African travel. "The only way
  to explore Africa is to go without arms and with few servants. You would not
  like it in England if a body of men came armed to the teeth and marched
  through your land. The Africans are quite as sensitive." It was the method of
  Livingstone as against the method of Stanley. The former takes the braver and
  better man.</p>

  <p>This negro gentleman did me good, for a man's brain is an organ for the
  formation of his own thoughts and also for the digestion of other people's,
  and it needs fresh fodder. We had, of course, books aboard the ship, but
  neither many nor good. I cannot trace that I made any mental or spiritual
  advancement during the voyage, but I added one more experience to my chaplet,
  and I suppose it all goes to some ultimate result in character or
  personality. I was a strong full-blooded young man, full of the joy of life,
  with nothing of what Oliver Wendell Holmes calls "pathological piety and
  tuberculous virtues." I was a man among men. I walked ever among pitfalls and
  I thank all ministering angels that I came through, while I have a softened
  heart for those who did not.</p>

  <p>Our voyage home&mdash;oil-gathering from port to port on the same but
  reversed route&mdash;was uneventful until the very last stride, when just as
  we were past Madeira the ship took fire. Whether it was the combustion of
  coal dust has never been determined, but certainly the fire broke out in the
  bunkers, and as there was only a wooden partition between these bunkers and a
  cargo of oil, we were in deadly danger. For the first day we took it lightly,
  as a mere smoulder, and for a second and third day we were content to seal
  the gratings as far as possible, to play down on it with the hose, and to
  shift the coal away from the oil. On the fourth morning, however, things took
  a sudden turn for the worse. I copy from my log book:</p>

  <p>"January 9. I was awakened early in the morning by the purser, Tom King,
  poking his head in at my door and informing me that the ship was in a blaze,
  and that all hands had been called and were working down below. I got my
  clothes on, but when I came on deck nothing was to be seen of it save thick
  volumes of smoke from the bunker ventilators, and a lurid glow down below. I
  offered to go down, but there seemed to be as many working as could be fitted
  in. I was then asked to call the passengers. I waked each in turn, and they
  all faced the situation very bravely and coolly. One, a Swiss, sat up in his
  bunk, rubbed his eyes, and in answer to my remark: 'The ship is on fire!'
  said: 'I have often been on ships that were on fire.' 'Splendide
  mendax'&mdash;but a good spirit! All day we fought the flames, and the iron
  side of the ship was red-hot at one point. Boats were prepared and
  provisioned and no doubt at the worst we could row or sail them to Lisbon,
  where my dear sisters would be considerably surprised if their big brother
  walked in. However, we are getting the better of it, and by evening those
  ominous pillars of smoke were down to mere wisps. So ends an ugly
  business!"</p>

  <p>On January 14 we were in Liverpool once more, and West Africa was but one
  more of the cinema reels of memory. It is, I am told, very much improved now
  in all things. My old friend and cricket companion, Sir Fred. Guggisberg, is
  Governor at Accra and has asked me to see the old ground under very different
  auspices. I wish I could, but the sands still run and there is much to be
  done.</p>

  <p class="chaphead">A Strange Character&mdash;His Honeymoon&mdash;His Bristol
  Practice&mdash;Telegram from Plymouth&mdash;Six Amusing Weeks&mdash;A Deep
  Plot&mdash;My Southsea Venture&mdash;Furnishing on the Cheap&mdash;The Plot
  Explodes.</p><br>

  <p class="first">I HAVE now come to the temporary end of my voyages, which
  were to be renewed in years to come, and I have reached the time when, under
  very curious circumstances, I endeavoured to establish myself in medical
  practice. In a book written some years afterwards called "The Stark Munro
  Letters," I drew in very close detail the events of the next few years, and
  there the curious reader will find them more clearly and fully set out than
  would be to scale in these pages. I would only remark, should any reader
  reconstruct me or my career from that book, that there are some few incidents
  there which are imaginary, and that, especially, the whole incident of the
  case of a lunatic and of Lord Saltire in Chapter IV occurred to a friend and
  not to myself. Otherwise the whole history of my association with the man
  whom I called Cullingworth, his extraordinary character, our parting and the
  way in which I was left to what seemed certain ruin, were all as depicted. I
  will here simply give the essentials of the story, and retain the fictitious
  name.</p>

  <p>In my last year of study at Edinburgh I formed a friendship with this
  remarkable student. He came of a famous medical family, his father having
  been a great authority upon zymotic disease. He came also of a famous
  athletic stock, and was a great Rugby forward himself, though rather
  handicapped by the Berserk fury with which he would play. He was up to
  international form, and his younger brother was reckoned by good judges to be
  about the best forward who ever donned the rose-embroidered jersey of
  England.</p>

  <p>Cullingworth was as strong mentally as physically. In person he was about
  5 ft. 9 in. in height, perfectly built, with a bulldog jaw, bloodshot
  deep-set eyes, overhanging brows, and yellowish hair as stiff as wire, which
  spurted up above his brows. He was a man born for trouble and adventure,
  unconventional in his designs and formidable in his powers of
  execution&mdash;a man of action with a big but incalculable brain guiding the
  action. He died in early middle age, and I understand that an autopsy
  revealed some cerebral abnormality, so that there was no doubt a pathological
  element in his strange explosive character. For some reason he took a fancy
  to me, and appeared to attach an undue importance to my advice.</p>

  <p>When I met him first he had just indulged in one of his wild escapades,
  which ended usually in a fight or in a transitory appearance in a police
  court, but on this occasion was more serious and permanent. He had run off
  with a charming young lady and married her, she being a ward in Chancery and
  under age. However, the deed was done and all the lawyers in the world could
  not undo it, though they might punish the culprit. He told me how he and the
  lady had gone over a Bradshaw with the intention that when they came on a
  station of which neither of them had ever heard, they would make for that
  place and spend their honeymoon there. They came therefore upon some awful
  name, Clodpole-in-the-Marsh or something of the kind, and there they
  sojourned in the village inn. Cullingworth stained his yellow hair black, but
  the stain took in some places and not in others, so that he looked as if he
  had escaped from Barnum's show. What Clodpole-in-the-Marsh could have thought
  of such an extraordinary couple I cannot imagine, and it is probably the one
  occasion on which it ever buzzed. I cannot think of any surer way of getting
  publicity than that which Culling-worth took to avoid detection. In London
  they would have been perfectly unobserved. I remember that for years
  Cullingworth's hair presented curious iridescent tints which were the remains
  of his disguise.</p>

  <p>He brought his bride safely to Edinburgh, where they hired a flat and
  lived in it without furnishing it save for the absolutely needful. I have
  dined with them there on an apple dumpling, seated on a pile of thick volumes
  as there was no chair. We introduced them to a few friends, did what we could
  for the lonely lady, and finally they drifted off, and for a time we heard no
  more.</p>

  <p>Just before I started for Africa I got a long telegram from Cullingworth
  imploring me to go to Bristol as he needed my advice. I was in Birmingham and
  I set forth at once. When I reached Bristol he conducted me to a fine
  mansion, and there poured out his tale of woe. He had started in great style,
  hoping to rally the remains of his father's patients, but his money had run
  out, he was dunned by his tradespeople, there were no patients, and what was
  he to do? We had a joyous riotous time for two days, for there was an
  exuberant atmosphere about the man which rose above all trouble. The only
  advice I could give was that he should make a composition with his creditors.
  I heard afterwards that he assembled them, addressed them in a long and
  emotional speech, reduced them almost to tears with his picture of the
  struggles of a deserving young man, and finally got a unanimous vote of
  confidence from them with full consent that he should pay at his own leisure.
  It was the sort of thing that he would do, and tell the story afterwards with
  a bull's roar of laughter which could be heard down the street.</p>

  <p>When I had been back a couple of months from Africa, I received another
  telegram&mdash;he always telegraphed and never wrote&mdash;which ran in some
  such way as this: "Started here last June. Colossal success. Come down by
  next train if possible. Plenty of room for you. Splendid opening." The
  telegram was stamped Plymouth. A second even more explosive telegram
  upbraided me for delay and guaranteed me £300 the first year. This looked
  like business, so off I went.</p>

  <p>The events of the next six weeks, in the late spring and early summer of
  1882, were more fitted for some rollicking novel than for the sober pages of
  a veracious chronicle. The conditions which I found at Plymouth were
  incredible. In a short time this man, half genius and half quack, had founded
  a practice worth several thousand pounds of ready money in the year. "Free
  consultations but pay for your medicine," was his slogan, and as he charged a
  good price for the latter it worked out all the same in the end. The mere
  words "Free Consultations" attracted crowds. He used drugs in a heroic and
  indiscriminate manner which produced dramatic results but at an unjustifiable
  risk. I remember one instance where dropsy had disappeared before a severe
  dose of croton oil in a way that set all the gossips talking. People flocked
  into the town from 20 and 30 miles round, and not only his waiting-rooms, but
  his stairs and his passages, were crammed. His behaviour to them was
  extraordinary. He roared and shouted, scolded them, joked them, pushed them
  about, and pursued them sometimes into the street, or addressed them
  collectively from the landing. A morning with him when the practice was in
  full blast was as funny as any pantomime and I was exhausted with laughter.
  He had a well-worn volume on Medical Jurisprudence which he pretended was the
  Bible, and he swore old women on it that they would drink no more tea. I have
  no doubt he did a great deal of good, for there was reason and knowledge
  behind all that he did, but his manner of doing it was unorthodox in the
  extreme. His wife made up the prescriptions at a pigeon-hole at the end of a
  passage, and received the price which was marked on the label carried down by
  the patient. Every evening Cullingworth walked back to his great residential
  house upon the Hoe, bearing his bag of silver, his coat flying, his hat on
  the back of his head, and his great fangs grinning up at every doctor whose
  disgusted face showed at a window.</p>

  <p>Cullingworth had rigged me up a room, furnished with one table and two
  chairs, in which I could take surgical or other cases which he did not care
  to handle. I fear that my professional manners were very unexciting after his
  more flamboyant efforts, which I could not imitate even if I would. I had,
  however, a steady dribble of patients, and it looked as if I might build
  something up. I went up country once, and operated upon an old fellow's nose
  which had contracted cancer through his holding the bowl of a short clay pipe
  immediately beneath it. I left him with an aristocratic, not to say
  supercilious organ, which was the wonder of the village, and might have been
  the foundation of my fame.</p>

  <p>But there were other influences at work, and the threads of fate were
  shooting out at strange unexpected angles. My mother had greatly resented my
  association with Cullingworth. Her family pride had been aroused, and justly
  as I can now see, though my wanderings had left me rather too Bohemian and
  careless upon points of etiquette. But I liked Cullingworth and even now I
  can't help liking him&mdash;and I admired his strong qualities and enjoyed
  his company and the extraordinary situations which arose from any association
  with him. This resistance upon my part, and my defence of my friend, annoyed
  my mother the more, and she wrote me several letters of remonstrance which
  certainly dealt rather faithfully with his character as it appeared to her. I
  was careless of my papers and these letters were read both by Cullingworth
  and his wife. I do them no injustice in saying this, for they finally
  admitted it. Apparently he imagined&mdash;he was a man of strange suspicions
  and secret plottings&mdash;that I was a party to such sentiments, whereas
  they were actually called forth by my defence of him. His manner changed, and
  more than once I caught his fierce grey eyes looking furtively at me with a
  strange sullen expression, so much so that I asked him what was the matter.
  He was actually scheming my ruin, which would be nothing financially, since I
  had nothing to lose, but would be much both to my mother and me if it touched
  my honour.</p>

  <p>One day he came to me and told me that he thought my presence complicated
  his practice and that we had better part. I agreed in all good humour,
  assuring him that I had not come to hurt him and that I was very grateful for
  what he had done, even if it came to nothing. He then strongly advised me to
  go into practice myself. I replied that I had no capital. He answered that he
  would see to that, that he would allow me a pound a week until I got my feet
  under me, and that I could repay it at leisure. I thanked him warmly, and
  after looking at Tavistock I finally decided that Portsmouth would be a good
  place, the only reason being that I knew the conditions at Plymouth, and
  Portsmouth seemed analogous. I boarded an Irish steamer, therefore, and about
  July of 1882 I started off by sea, with one small trunk containing all my
  earthly possessions, to start practice in a town in which I knew no single
  soul. My cash balance was under £10, and I knew not only that I had to meet
  all present expenses upon this, but that I had to furnish a house upon it. On
  the other hand the weekly pound should easily cover all personal needs, and I
  had the devil-may-care optimism of youth as to the future.</p>

  <p>When I arrived at Portsmouth I went into lodgings for a week. On the very
  first night, with that curious faculty for running into dramatic situations
  which has always been with me, I became involved in a street fight with a
  rough who was beating (or rather kicking) a woman. It was a strange start,
  and after I began my practice one of the first people to whom I opened my
  door was this very rascal. I don't suppose he recognized me, but I could have
  sworn to him. I emerged from the fray without much damage, and was very glad
  to escape some serious scandal. It was the second time that I had got knocked
  about in defence of beauty in distress.</p>

  <p>I spent a week in marking down the unoccupied houses, and finally settled
  at £40 a year into Bush Villa, which a kindly landlord has now called Doyle
  House. I was terrified lest the agent should ask for a deposit, but the name
  of my C.B. uncle as reference turned the scale in my favour. Having secured
  the empty house and its key, I went down to a sale in Portsea and for about
  £4 secured quite a lot of second-hand&mdash;possibly
  tenth-hand&mdash;furniture. It met my needs and enabled me to make one room
  possible for patients with three chairs, a table and a central patch of
  carpet. I had a bed of sorts and a mattress upstairs. I fixed up the plate
  which I had brought from Plymouth, bought a red lamp on tick, and fairly
  settled down in receipt of custom. When all was done I had a couple of pounds
  in hand. Servants, of course, were out of the question, so I polished my own
  plate every morning, brushed down my front, and kept the house reasonably
  clean. I found that I could live quite easily and well on less than a
  shilling a day, so I could hold out for a long period.</p>

  <p>I had at this time contributed several stories to "London Society," a
  magazine now defunct, but then flourishing under the editorship of a Mr.
  Hogg. In the April, 1882, number I had a story, now happily forgotten, called
  "Bones," while in the preceding Christmas number I had another, "The Gully of
  Bluemansdyke," both of them feeble echoes of Bret Harte. These, with the
  stories already mentioned, made up my whole output at this time. I explained
  to Mr. Hogg how I was situated, and wrote for him a new tale for his
  Christmas number entitled "My Friend the Murderer." Hogg behaved very well
  and sent me £10, which I laid by for my first quarter's rent. I was not so
  pleased with him when, years later, he claimed the full copyright of all
  these immature stories, and published them in a volume with my name attached.
  Have a care, young authors, have a care, or your worst enemy will be your
  early self!</p>

  <p>It was as well that I had that £10, for Cullingworth, having learned that
  I was fairly committed, with my lease signed, now hurled his thunderbolt,
  which he thought would crush me. It was a curt letter&mdash;not a telegram
  for a wonder&mdash;in which he admitted that my letters had been read,
  expressed surprise that such a correspondence should have gone on while I was
  under his roof, and declared that he could have nothing more to do with me.
  He had, of course, no real grievance, but I am quite willing to admit that he
  honestly thought he had. But his method of revenge was a strange example of
  the schemings of a morbid mind.</p>

  <p>For a moment I was staggered. But my boats were burned and I must go
  forward. I sent back a derisive reply to Cullingworth, and put him out of my
  head for ever&mdash;indeed, I heard of him no more until some five years
  later I read the news of his premature death. He was a remarkable man and
  narrowly escaped being a great one. I fear that he lived up to his great
  income and left his wife but poorly off.</p>

     id="ch-07"></a>VII &mdash; MY START AT SOUTHSEA</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">A Strange Life&mdash;Arrival of my Brother&mdash;I Buy up
  a Shop&mdash;Cheap Servants&mdash;Queer Patients&mdash;Dangers of Medical
  Practice&mdash;Income Tax Joke&mdash;My Marriage&mdash;Tragedy in my
  House&mdash;A New Phase.</p><br>

  <p class="first">WHAT with cleaning up, answering the bell, doing my modest
  shopping, which was measured in pennies rather than shillings, and perfecting
  my simple household arrangements, the time did not hang heavily upon my
  hands. It is a wonderful thing to have a house of your own for the first
  time, however humble it may be. I lavished all my care upon the front room to
  make it possible for patients. The back room was furnished with my trunk and
  a stool. Inside the trunk was my larder, and the top of it was my dining-room
  table. There was gas laid on, and I rigged a projection from the wall by
  which I could sling a pan over the gas jet. In this way I cooked bacon with
  great ease, and became expert in getting a wonderful lot of slices from a
  pound. Bread, bacon and tea, with an occasional saveloy&mdash;what could man
  ask for more? It is (or was) perfectly easy to live well upon a shilling a
  day.</p>

  <p>I had obtained a fair consignment of drugs on tick from a wholesale house
  and these also were ranged round the sides of the back room. From the very
  beginning a few stray patients of the poorest class, some of them desirous of
  novelty, some disgruntled with their own doctors, the greater part owing
  bills and ashamed to face their creditor, came to consult me and consume a
  bottle of my medicine. I could pay for my food by the drugs I sold. It was as
  well, for I had no other way of paying for it, and I had sworn not to touch
  the ten golden pieces which represented my rent. There have been times when I
  could not buy a postage stamp and my letters have had to wait, but the ten
  golden coins still remained intact.</p>

  <p>It was a busy thoroughfare, with a church on one side of my house and an
  hotel on the other. The days passed pleasantly enough, for it was a lovely
  warm autumn, and I sat in the window of my consulting-room screened by the
  rather dingy curtain which I had put up, and watched the passing crowd or
  read my book, for I had spent part of my scanty funds on making myself a
  member of a circulating library. In spite of my sparse food, or more probably
  on account of it, I was extraordinarily fit and well, so that at night when
  all hope of patients was gone for that day I would lock up my house and walk
  many miles to work off my energy. With its imperial associations it is a
  glorious place and even now if I had to live in a town outside London it is
  surely to Southsea, the residential quarter of Portsmouth, that I would turn.
  The history of the past carries on into the history of to-day, the new
  torpedo-boat flies past the old <i>Victory</i> with the same white ensign
  flying from each, and the old Elizabethan culverins and sakers can still be
  seen in the same walk which brings you to the huge artillery of the forts.
  There is a great glamour there to any one with the historic sense&mdash;a
  sense which I drank in with my mother's milk.</p>

  <p>It had never entered my head yet that literature might give me a career,
  or anything beyond a little casual pocket money, but already it was a
  deciding factor in my life, for I could not have held on, and must have
  either starved or given in but for the few pounds which Mr. Hogg sent me, for
  they enabled all other smaller sums to be spent in nourishment. I have
  wondered sometimes as I look back that I did not contract scurvy, for most of
  my food was potted, and I had no means of cooking vegetables. However, I felt
  no grievance at the time nor any particular perception that my mode of life
  was unusual, nor indeed any particular anxiety about the future. At that age
  everything seems an adventure&mdash;and there was always the novel pleasure
  of the house.</p>

  <p>Once I had a moment of weakness during which I answered an advertisement
  which asked for a doctor to attend coolies in the tea gardens of the Terai. I
  spent a few unsettled days waiting for an answer, but none came and I settled
  down once more to my waiting and hoping. I had one avenue of success open of
  which I could not avail myself. My Catholic relatives had sent me
  introductions to the Bishop and I was assured that there was no Catholic
  doctor in the town. My mind, however, was so perfectly clear and I had so
  entirely broken away from the old faith that I could not possibly use it for
  material ends. I therefore burned the letter of introduction.</p>

  <p>As the weeks passed and I had no one with whom to talk I began to think
  wistfully of the home circle at Edinburgh, and to wonder why, with my
  eight-roomed house, one or more of them should not come to keep me company.
  The girls were already governessing or preparing to do so, but there was my
  little brother Innes It would relieve my mother and yet help me if he could
  join me. So it was arranged, and one happy evening the little
  knicker-bockered fellow, just ten years old, joined me as my comrade. No man
  could have had a merrier and brighter one. In a few weeks we had settled down
  to a routine life, I having found a good day-school for him. The soldiers of
  Portsmouth were already a great joy to him, and his future career was marked
  out by his natural tastes, for he was a born leader and administrator. Little
  did I foresee that he would win distinction in the greatest of all wars, and
  die in the prime of his manhood&mdash;but not before he knew that complete
  victory had been attained. Even then our thoughts were very military, and I
  remember how we waited together outside the office of the local paper that we
  might learn the result of the bombardment of Alexandria.</p>

  <p>Turning over some old papers after these pages were written I came upon a
  letter written in straggling schoolboy script by my little brother to his
  mother at home which may throw an independent light upon those curious days.
  It is dated August 16, 1882. He says:</p>

  <p>"The patients are crowding in. We have made three bob this week. We have
  vaxenated a baby and got hold of a man with consumption, and to-day a gipsy's
  cart came up to the door selling baskets and chairs so we determined not to
  let the man ring as long as he liked. After he had rang two or three times
  Arthur yelled out at the pitch of his voice, Go a way but the man rang again
  so I went down to the door and pulled open the letter box and cried out go a
  way. The man began to swear at me and say that he wanted to see Arthur. All
  this time Arthur thought that the door was open and was yelling Shut that
  door. Then I came upstairs and told Arthur what the man had said so Arthur
  went down and opened the door and we found out that the gipsy's child had
  measles...After all we got sixpence out of them and that is all ways
  something."</p>

  <p>I remember the incident well, and certainly my sudden change of tone from
  the indignant householder, who is worried by a tramp, to my best bedside
  manner in the hopes of a fee, must have been very amusing. My recollection
  is, however, that it was the Gipsy who got sixpence out of us.</p>

  <p>For some time Innes and I lived entirely alone, doing the household tasks
  between us, and going long walks in the evening to keep ourselves fit. Then I
  had a brain-wave and I put an advertisement in the evening paper that a
  ground floor was to let in exchange for services. I had numerous applicants
  in reply, and out of them I chose two elderly women who claimed to be
  sisters&mdash;a claim which they afterwards failed to make good. When once
  they were installed we became quite a civilized household and things began to
  look better. There were complex quarrels, however, and one of the women left.
  The other soon afterwards followed suit. As the first woman had seemed to me
  to be the most efficient, I followed her up and found that she had started a
  small shop. Her rent was weekly, so that was easily settled, but she talked
  gloomily about her stock. "I will buy everything in your shop," I said in a
  large way. It cost me exactly seventeen and sixpence, and I was loaded up for
  many months with matches, cakes of blacking and other merchandise. From then
  onwards our meals were cooked for us, and we became in all ways normal.</p>

  <p>Month followed month and I picked up a patient here and a patient there
  until the nucleus of a little practice had been formed. Sometimes it was an
  accident, sometimes an emergency case, sometimes a newcomer to the town or
  one who had quarrelled with his doctor. I mixed with people so far as I
  could, for I learned that a brass plate alone will never attract, and people
  must see the human being who lies in wait behind it. Some of my tradespeople
  gave me their custom in return for mine, and mine was so small that I was
  likely to have the best of the bargain. There was a grocer who developed
  epileptic fits, which meant butter and tea to us. Poor fellow, he could never
  have realized the mixed feelings with which I received the news of a fresh
  outbreak. Then there was a very tall, horse-faced old lady with an
  extraordinary dignity of bearing. She would sit framed in the window of her
  little house, like the picture of a <i>grande dame</i> of the old régime. But
  every now and again she went on a wild burst, in the course of which she
  would skim plates out of the window at the passers-by. I was the only one who
  had influence over her at such times, for she was a haughty, autocratic old
  person. Once she showed an inclination to skim a plate at me also, but I
  quelled her by assuming a gloomy dignity as portentous as her own. She had
  some art treasures which she heaped upon me when she was what we will
  politely call "ill," but claimed back again the moment she was well. Once
  when she had been particularly troublesome I retained a fine lava jug, in
  spite of her protests, and I have got it yet.</p>

  <p>It is well that medical practice has its humorous side, for it has much to
  depress one. Most men never use their reasoning power at all on the religious
  side, but if they did they would find it difficult sometimes to reconcile the
  sights which a physician sees with the idea of a merciful providence. If one
  loses the explanation that this life is a spiritual chastening for another,
  and thinks that death ends all, and that this is our one experience, then it
  is impossible to sustain the goodness or the omnipotence of God. So I felt at
  the time, and it made me a Materialist, but now I know well that I was
  judging a story on the strength of one chapter.</p>

  <p>Let me give an example. I was called in by a poor woman to see her
  daughter. As I entered the humble sitting-room there was a small cot at one
  side, and by the gesture of the mother I understood that the sufferer was
  there. I picked up a candle and walking over I stooped over the little bed,
  expecting to see a child. What I really saw was a pair of brown sullen eyes,
  full of loathing and pain, which looked up in resentment to mine. I could not
  tell how old the creature was. Long thin limbs were twisted and coiled in the
  tiny couch. The face was sane but malignant. "What is it?" I asked in dismay
  when we were out of hearing. "It's a girl," sobbed the mother. "She's
  nineteen. Oh! if God would only take her!" What a life for both! And how hard
  to face such facts and accept any of the commonplace explanations of
  existence!</p>

  <p>Medical life is full of dangers and pitfalls, and luck must always play
  its part in a man's career. Many a good man has been ruined by pure bad luck.
  On one occasion I was called in to a lady who was suffering from what
  appeared to be dyspepsia of a rather severe type. There was absolutely
  nothing to indicate anything more serious. I therefore reassured the family,
  spoke lightly of the illness, and walked home to make up a bismuth mixture
  for her, calling on one or two other cases on the way. When I got home I
  found a messenger waiting to say that the lady was dead. This is the sort of
  thing which may happen to any man at any time. It did not hurt me, for I was
  too lowly to be hurt. You can't ruin a practice when there is no practice.
  The woman really had a gastric ulcer, for which there is no diagnosis; it was
  eating its way into the lining of her stomach, it pierced an artery after I
  saw her, and she bled to death. Nothing could have saved her, and I think her
  relatives came to understand this.</p>

  <p>I made £154 the first year, and £250 the second, rising slowly to £800,
  which in eight years I never passed, so far as the medical practice went. In
  the first year the Income Tax paper arrived and I filled it up to show that I
  was not liable. They returned the paper with "Most unsatisfactory" scrawled
  across it. I wrote "I entirely agree" under the words, and returned it once
  more. For this little bit of cheek I was had up before the assessors, and
  duly appeared with my ledger under my arm. They could make nothing, however,
  out of me or my ledger, and we parted with mutual laughter and
  compliments.</p>

  <p>In the year 1885 my brother left me to go to a public school in Yorkshire.
  Shortly afterwards I was married. A lady named Mrs. Hawkins, a widow of a
  Gloucestershire family, had come to Southsea with her son and daughter, the
  latter a very gentle and amiable girl. I was brought into contact with them
  through the illness of the son, which was of a sudden and violent nature,
  arising from cerebral meningitis. As the mother was very awkwardly situated
  in lodgings, I volunteered to furnish an extra bedroom in my house and give
  the poor lad, who was in the utmost danger, my personal attention. His case
  was a mortal one, and in spite of all I could do he passed away a few days
  later. Such a death under my own roof naturally involved me in a good deal of
  anxiety and trouble&mdash;indeed, if I had not had the foresight to ask a
  medical friend to see him with me on the day before he passed away, I should
  have been in a difficult position. The funeral was from my house. The family
  were naturally grieved at the worry to which they had quite innocently
  exposed me, and so our relations became intimate and sympathetic, which ended
  in the daughter consenting to share my fortunes. We were married on August 6,
  1885, and no man could have had a more gentle and amiable life's companion.
  Our union was marred by the sad ailment which came after a very few years to
  cast its shadow over our lives, but it comforts me to think that during the
  time when we were together there was no single occasion when our affection
  was disturbed by any serious breach or division, the credit of which lies
  entirely with her own quiet philosophy, which enabled her to bear with
  smiling patience not only her own sad illness, which lasted so long, but all
  those other vicissitudes which life brings with it. I rejoice to think that
  though she married a penniless doctor, she was spared long enough to fully
  appreciate the pleasure and the material comforts which worldly success was
  able to bring us. She had some small income of her own which enabled me to
  expand my simple housekeeping in a way which gave her from the first the
  decencies, if not the luxuries, of life.</p>

  <p>In many ways my marriage marked a turning-point in my life. A bachelor,
  especially one who had been a wanderer like myself, drifts easily into
  Bohemian habits, and I was no exception. I cannot look back upon those years
  with any spiritual satisfaction, for I was still in the valley of darkness. I
  had ceased to butt my head incessantly against what seemed to be an
  impenetrable wall, and I had resigned myself to ignorance upon that which is
  the most momentous question in life&mdash;for a voyage is bleak indeed if one
  has no conception to what port one is bound. I had laid aside the old charts
  as useless, and had quite despaired of ever finding a new one which would
  enable me to steer an intelligible course, save towards that mist which was
  all that my pilots, Huxley, Mill, Spencer and others, could see ahead of us.
  My mental attitude is correctly portrayed in "The Stark Munro Letters." A dim
  light of dawn was to come to me soon in an uncertain fitful way which was
  destined in time to spread and grow brighter.</p>

  <p>Up to now the main interest of my life lay in my medical career. But with
  the more regular life and the greater sense of responsibility, coupled with
  the natural development of brain-power, the literary side of me began slowly
  to spread until it was destined to push the other entirely aside. Thus a new
  phase had begun, part medical, part literary, and part philosophical, which I
  shall deal with in another chapter.</p>

     id="ch-08"></a>VIII &mdash; MY FIRST LITERARY SUCCESS</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">New Outlook&mdash;Cornhill Dinner&mdash;James
  Payn&mdash;"A Study in Scarlet"&mdash;Genesis of Holmes&mdash;Micah
  Clarke&mdash;Disappointments&mdash;Andrew Lang&mdash;Oscar Wilde&mdash;His
  Criticism of Himself&mdash;"The White Company."</p><br>

  <p class="first">DURING the years before my marriage I had from time to time
  written short stories which were good enough to be marketable at very small
  prices&mdash;£4 on an average&mdash;but not good enough to reproduce. They
  are scattered about amid the pages of "London Society," "All the Year Round,"
  "Temple Bar," "The Boy's Own Paper," and other journals. There let them lie.
  They served their purpose in relieving me a little of that financial burden
  which always pressed upon me. I can hardly have earned more than £10 or £15 a
  year from this source, so that the idea of making a living by it never
  occurred to me. But though I was not putting out I was taking in. I still
  have notebooks full of all sorts of knowledge which I acquired during that
  time. It is a great mistake to start putting out cargo when you have hardly
  stowed any on board. My own slow methods and natural limitations made me
  escape this danger.</p>

  <p>After my marriage, however, my brain seems to have quickened and both my
  imagination and my range of expression were greatly improved. Most of the
  short stories which appeared eventually in my "Captain of the Polestar" were
  written in those years from 1885 to 1890. Some of them are perhaps as good
  honest work as any that I have done. What gave me great pleasure and for the
  first time made me realize that I was ceasing to be a hack writer and was
  getting into good company was when James Payn accepted my short story
  "Habakuk Jephson's Statement" for "Cornhill." I had a reverence for this
  splendid magazine with its traditions from Thackeray to Stevenson and the
  thought that I had won my way into it pleased me even more than the cheque
  for £30, which came duly to hand. It was, of course, anonymous,&mdash;such
  was the law of the magazine&mdash;which protects the author from abuse as
  well as prevents his winning fame. One paper began its review by the phrase
  "'Cornhill opens its new number with a story which would have made Thackeray
  turn in his grave." A dear old gentleman who knew me hurried across the road
  to show me the paper with these cheering words. Another, more gracious, said,
  "'Cornhill' begins the New Year with an exceedingly powerful story in which
  we seem to trace the hand of the author of 'The New Arabian Nights.'" It was
  great praise, but something less warm, which came straight to my own address,
  would have pleased me better.</p>

  <p>I soon had two other stories in the "Cornhill"&mdash;"John Huxford's
  Hiatus" and "The Ring of Thoth." I also penetrated the stout Scottish barrier
  of "Blackwood" with a story, "The Physiologist's Wife," which was written
  when I was under the influence of Henry James. But I was still in the days of
  very small things&mdash;so small that when a paper sent me a woodcut and
  offered me four guineas if I would write a story to correspond I was not too
  proud to accept. It was a very bad woodcut and I think that the story
  corresponded all right. I remember writing a New Zealand story, though why I
  should have written about a place of which I knew nothing I cannot imagine.
  Some New Zealand critic pointed out that I had given the exact bearings of
  the farm mentioned as 90 miles to the east or west of the town of Nelson, and
  that in that case it was situated 20 miles out on the floor of the Pacific
  Ocean. These little things will happen. There are times when accuracy is
  necessary and others where the idea is everything and the place quite
  immaterial.</p>

  <p>It was about a year after my marriage that I realized that I could go on
  doing short stories for ever and never make headway. What is necessary is
  that your name should be on the back of a volume. Only so do you assert your
  individuality, and get the full credit or discredit of your achievement. I
  had for some time from 1884 onwards been engaged upon a sensational book of
  adventure which I had called "The Firm of Girdlestone," which represented my
  first attempt at a connected narrative. Save for occasional patches it is a
  worthless book, and, like the first book of everyone else, unless he is a
  great original genius, it was too reminiscent of the work of others. I could
  see it then, and could see it even more clearly later. When I sent it to
  publishers and they scorned it I quite acquiesced in their decision and
  finally let it settle, after its periodical flights to town, a dishevelled
  mass of manuscript at the back of a drawer.</p>

  <p>I felt now that I was capable of something fresher and crisper and more
  workmanlike. Gaboriau had rather attracted me by the neat dovetailing of his
  plots, and Poe's masterful detective, M. Dupin, had from boyhood been one of
  my heroes. But could I bring an addition of my own? I thought of my old
  teacher Joe Bell, of his eagle face, of his curious ways, of his eerie trick
  of spotting details. If he were a detective he would surely reduce this
  fascinating but unorganized business to something nearer to an exact science.
  I would try if I could get this effect. It was surely possible in real life,
  so why should I not make it plausible in fiction? It is all very well to say
  that a man is clever, but the reader wants to see examples of it&mdash;such
  examples as Bell gave us every day in the wards. The idea amused me. What
  should I call the fellow? I still possess the leaf of a notebook with various
  alternative names. One rebelled against the elementary art which gives some
  inkling of character in the name, and creates Mr. Sharps or Mr. Ferrets.
  First it was Sherringford Holmes; then it was Sherlock Holmes. He could not
  tell his own exploits, so he must have a commonplace comrade as a
  foil&mdash;an educated man of action who could both join in the exploits and
  narrate them. A drab, quiet name for this unostentatious man. Watson would
  do. And so I had my puppets and wrote my "Study in Scarlet."</p>

  <p>I knew that the book was as good as I could make it, and I had high hopes.
  When "Girdlestone" used to come circling back with the precision of a homing
  pigeon, I was grieved but not surprised, for I acquiesced in the decision.
  But when my little Holmes book began also to do the circular tour I was hurt,
  for I knew that it deserved a better fate. James Payn applauded but found it
  both too short and too long, which was true enough. Arrowsmith received it in
  May, 1886, and returned it unread in July. Two or three others sniffed and
  turned away. Finally, as Ward, Lock &amp; Co. made a speciality of cheap and
  often sensational literature, I sent it to them.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Sir," they said,&mdash;"We have read your story and
  are pleased with it. We could not publish it this year as the market is
  flooded at present with cheap fiction, but if you do not object to its being
  held over till next year, we will give you £25 for the copyright.<br>
  <br>
  "Yours faithfully,<br>
  "WARD, LOCK &amp; Co."<br>
  "<i>Oct</i>. 30, 1886."</p>

  <p>It was not a very tempting offer, and even I, poor as I was, hesitated to
  accept it. It was not merely the small sum offered, but it was the long
  delay, for this book might open a road for me. I was heart-sick, however, at
  repeated disappointments, and I felt that perhaps it was true wisdom to make
  sure of publicity, however late. Therefore I accepted, and the book became
  "Beeton's Xmas Annual" of 1887. I never at any time received another penny
  for it.</p>

  <p>Having a long wait in front of me before this book could appear, and
  feeling large thoughts rise within me, I now determined to test my powers to
  the full, and I chose a historical novel for this end, because it seemed to
  me the one way of combining a certain amount of literary dignity with those
  scenes of action and adventure which were natural to my young and ardent
  mind. I had always felt great sympathy for the Puritans, who, after all,
  whatever their little peculiarities, did represent political liberty and
  earnestness in religion. They had usually been caricatured in fiction and
  art. Even Scott had not drawn them as they were. Macaulay, who was always one
  of my chief inspirations, had alone made them comprehensible&mdash;the sombre
  fighters, with their Bibles and their broadswords. There is a great passage
  of his&mdash;I cannot quote it verbally&mdash;in which he says that after the
  Restoration if ever you saw a carter more intelligent than his fellows, or a
  peasant who tilled his land better, you would be likely to find that it was
  an old pikeman of Cromwell's. This, then, was my inspiration in "Micah
  Clarke," where I fairly let myself go upon the broad highway of adventure. I
  was well up in history, but I spent some months over details and then wrote
  the book very rapidly. There are bits of it, the picture of the Puritan
  household, and the sketch of Judge Jeffreys, which I have never bettered.
  When it was finished early in 1888 my hopes ran high and out it went on its
  travels.</p>

  <p>But, alas! although my Holmes booklet was out, and had attracted some
  little favourable comment, the door still seemed to be barred. James Payn had
  first peep, and he began his letter of rejection with the sentence "How can
  you, can you, waste your time and your wits writing historical novels!" This
  was depressing after a year of work. Then came Bentley's verdict: "It lacks
  in our opinion the one great necessary point for fiction, i.e. interest; and
  this being the case we do not think it could ever become popular with
  libraries and the general public." Then Blackwood had its say: "There are
  imperfections which would militate against success. The chances of the book
  proving a popular success do not seem to be strong enough to warrant us in
  publishing it." There were others even more depressing. I was on the point of
  putting the worn manuscript into hospital with its mangled brother
  "Girdle-stone" when as a last resource I sent it to Longmans, whose reader,
  Andrew Lang, liked it and advised its acceptance. It was to "Andrew of the
  brindled hair," as Stevenson called him, that I owe my first real opening,
  and I have never forgotten it. The book duly appeared in February, 1889, and
  though it was not a boom book it had extraordinarily good reviews, including
  one special one all to itself by Mr. Protheroe in the "Nineteenth Century,"
  and it has sold without intermission from that day to this. It was the first
  solid corner-stone laid for some sort of literary reputation.</p>

  <p>British literature had a considerable vogue in the United States at this
  time for the simple reason that there was no copyright and they had not to
  pay for it. It was hard on British authors, but far harder on American ones,
  since they were exposed to this devastating competition. Like all national
  sins it brought its own punishment not only to American authors, who were
  guiltless, but to the publishers themselves, for what belongs to everyone
  belongs practically to no one, and they could not bring out a decent edition
  without being at once undersold. I have seen some of my early American
  editions which might have been printed on the paper that shopmen use for
  parcels. One good result, however, from my point of view was that a British
  author, if he had anything in him, soon won recognition over there, and
  afterwards, when the Copyright Act was passed, he had his audience all ready
  for him. My Holmes book had met with some American success and presently I
  learned that an agent of Lippincott's was in London and that he wished to see
  me, to arrange for a book. Needless to say that I gave my patients a rest for
  a day and eagerly kept the appointment.</p>

  <p>Once only before had I touched the edge of literary society. That was when
  "Cornhill" was turned into a fully illustrated journal, an experiment which
  failed for it was quickly abandoned. The change was celebrated by a dinner at
  the Ship, at Greenwich, to which I was invited on the strength of my short
  contributions. All the authors and artists were there, and I remember the
  reverence with which I approached James Payn, who was to me the warden of the
  sacred gate. I was among the first arrivals, and was greeted by Mr. Smith,
  the head of the firm, who introduced me to Payn. I loved much of his work and
  waited in awe for the first weighty remark which should fall from his lips.
  It was that there was a crack in the window and he wondered how the devil it
  had got there. Let me add, however, that my future experience was to show
  that there was no wittier or more delightful companion in the world. I sat
  next to Anstey that night, who had just made a most deserved hit with his
  "Vice Versa," and I was introduced to other celebrities, so that I came back
  walking on air.</p>

  <p>Now for the second time I was in London on literary business. Stoddart,
  the American, proved to be an excellent fellow, and had two others to dinner.
  They were Gill, a very entertaining Irish M.P., and Oscar Wilde, who was
  already famous as the champion of aestheticism. It was indeed a golden
  evening for me. Wilde to my surprise had read "Micah Clarke" and was
  enthusiastic about it, so that I did not feel a complete outsider. His
  conversation left an indelible impression upon my mind. He towered above us
  all, and yet had the art of seeming to be interested in all that we could
  say. He had delicacy of feeling and tact, for the monologue man, however,
  clever, can never be a gentleman at heart. He took as well as gave, but what
  he gave was unique. He had a curious precision of statement, a delicate
  flavour of humour, and a trick of small gestures to illustrate his meaning,
  which were peculiar to himself. The effect cannot be reproduced, but I
  remember how in discussing the wars of the future he said: "A chemist on each
  side will approach the frontier with a bottle"&mdash;his upraised hand and
  precise face conjuring up a vivid and grotesque picture. His anecdotes, too,
  were happy and curious. We were discussing the cynical maxim that the good
  fortune of our friends made us discontented. "The devil," said Wilde, "was
  once crossing the Libyan Desert, and he came upon a spot where a number of
  small fiends were tormenting a holy hermit. The sainted man easily shook off
  their evil suggestions. The devil watched their failure and then he stepped
  forward to give them a lesson. 'What you do is too crude,' said he. 'Permit
  me for one moment.' With that he whispered to the holy man, 'Your brother has
  just been made Bishop of Alexandria.' A scowl of malignant jealousy at once
  clouded the serene face of the hermit. 'That,' said the devil to his imps,
  'is the sort of thing which I should recommend.'"</p>

  <p>The result of the evening was that both Wilde and I promised to write
  books for "Lippincott's Magazine"&mdash;Wilde's contribution was "The Picture
  of Dorian Grey," a book which is surely upon a high moral plane, while I
  wrote "The Sign of Four," in which Holmes made his second appearance. I
  should add that never in Wilde's conversation did I observe one trace of
  coarseness of thought, nor could one at that time associate him with such an
  idea. Only once again did I see him, many years afterwards, and then he gave
  me the impression of being mad. He asked me, I remember, if I had seen some
  play of his which was running. I answered that I had not. He said: "Ah, you
  must go. It is wonderful. It is genius!" All this with the gravest face.
  Nothing could have been more different from his early gentlemanly instincts.
  I thought at the time, and still think, that the monstrous development which
  ruined him was pathological, and that a hospital rather than a police court
  was the place for its consideration.</p>

  <p>When his little book came out I wrote to say what I thought of it. His
  letter is worth reproducing, as showing the true Wilde. I omit the early part
  in which he comments on my own work in too generous terms.</p>

  <p>"Between me and life there is a mist of words always. I throw probability
  out of the window for the sake of a phrase, and the chance of an epigram
  makes me desert truth. Still I do aim at making a work of art, and I am
  really delighted that you think my treatment subtle and artistically good.
  The newspapers seem to me to be written by the prurient for the Philistine. I
  cannot understand how they can treat 'Dorian Grey' as immoral. My difficulty
  was to keep the inherent moral subordinate to the artistic and dramatic
  effect, and it still seems to me that the moral is too obvious."</p>

  <p>Encouraged by the kind reception which "Micah Clarke" had received from
  the critics, I now determined upon an even bolder and more ambitious flight.
  It seemed to me that the days of Edward III constituted the greatest epoch in
  English History&mdash;an epoch when both the French and the Scottish kings
  were prisoners in London. This result had been brought about mainly by the
  powers of a body of men who were renowned through Europe but who had never
  been drawn in British literature, for though Scott treated in his inimitable
  way the English archer, it was as an outlaw rather than as a soldier that he
  drew him. I had some views of my own, too, about the Middle Ages which I was
  anxious to set forth. I was familiar with Froissart and Chaucer and I was
  aware that the famous knights of old were by no means the athletic heroes of
  Scott, but were often of a very different type. Hence came my two books "The
  White Company," written in 1889, and "Sir Nigel," written fourteen years
  later. Of the two I consider the latter the better book, but I have no
  hesitation in saying that the two of them taken together did thoroughly
  achieve my purpose, that they made an accurate picture of that great age, and
  that as a single piece of work they form the most complete, satisfying and
  ambitious thing that I have ever done. All things find their level, but I
  believe that if I had never touched Holmes, who has tended to obscure my
  higher work, my position in literature would at the present moment be a more
  commanding one. The work needed much research and I have still got my
  notebooks full of all sorts of lore. I cultivate a simple style and avoid
  long words so far as possible, and it may be that this surface of ease has
  sometimes caused the reader to underrate the amount of real research which
  lies in all my historical novels. It is not a matter which troubles me,
  however, for I have always felt that justice is done in the end, and that the
  real merit of any work is never permanently lost.</p>

  <p>I remember that as I wrote the last words of "The White Company" I felt a
  wave of exultation and with a cry of "That's done it!" I hurled my inky pen
  across the room, where it left a black smudge upon the duck's-egg wall-paper.
  I knew in my heart that the book would live and that it would illuminate our
  national traditions. Now that it has passed through fifty editions I suppose
  I may say with all modesty that my forecast has proved to be correct. This
  was the last book which I wrote in my days of doctoring at South-sea, and
  marks an epoch in my life, so I can now hark back to some other phases of my
  last years at Bush Villa before I broke away into a new existence. I will
  only add that "The White Company" was accepted by "Cornhill," in spite of
  James Payn's opinion of historical novels, and that I fulfilled another
  ambition by having a serial in that famous magazine.</p>

  <p>A new phase of medical experience came to me about this time, for I
  suddenly found myself a unit in the British Army. The operations in the East
  had drained the Medical Service, and it had therefore been determined that
  local civilian doctors should be enrolled for temporary duty of some hours a
  day. The terms were a guinea a day, and a number of us were tempted to
  volunteer where there were only a few vacancies. When I was called before the
  Board of Selection a savage-looking old army doctor who presided barked out,
  "And you, sir&mdash;what are you prepared to do?" To which I answered,
  "Anything." It seems that the others had all been making bargains and
  reservations, so my wholehearted reply won the job.</p>

  <p>It brought me into closer contact with the savage-looking medico, who
  proved to be Sir Anthony Home, V.C.&mdash;an honour which he had won in the
  Indian Mutiny. He was in supreme charge, and as he was as fierce in speech
  and in act as in appearance, everyone was terrified of him. On one occasion I
  had told the orderly to draw a man's tooth, knowing that he was a very much
  more skilful dentist than I. I was on my way home when I was overtaken by an
  excited soldier who told me that Sergeant Jones was being court-martialled
  and would certainly lose his stripes because he had done a minor operation. I
  hurried back and on entering the room found Sir Anthony glaring at the
  unhappy man, while several other orderlies stood round awaiting their own
  turn. Sir Anthony's glare was transferred to me when I said that whatever the
  Sergeant had done was by my express order. He grunted, banged the book he was
  holding, and broke up the meeting. He seemed a most disagreeable old man, and
  yet when I was married shortly afterwards he sent me a most charming message
  wishing me good fortune. Up to then I had never had anything from him save a
  scowl from his thick eyebrows, so I was most agreeably surprised. Soon
  afterwards the pressure ceased and we civilians were all dismissed.</p>

  <p class="first">IT was in these years after my marriage and before leaving
  Southsea that I planted the first seeds of those psychic studies which were
  destined to revolutionize my views and to absorb finally all the energies of
  my life. I had at that time the usual contempt which the young educated man
  feels towards the whole subject which has been covered by the clumsy name of
  Spiritualism. I had read of mediums being convicted of fraud, I had heard of
  phenomena which were opposed to every known scientific law, and I had
  deplored the simplicity and credulity which could deceive good, earnest
  people into believing that such bogus happenings were signs of intelligence
  outside our own existence. Educated as I had been during my most plastic
  years in the school of medical materialism, and soaked in the negative views
  of all my great teachers, I had no room in my brain for theories which cut
  right across every fixed conclusion that I had formed. I was wrong and my
  great teachers were wrong, but still I hold that they wrought well and that
  their Victorian agnosticism was in the interests of the human race, for it
  shook the old iron-clad unreasoning Evangelical position which was so
  universal before their days. For all rebuilding a site must be cleared. There
  were two separate Victorian movements towards change, the one an attempt to
  improve the old building and make it good enough to carry on&mdash;as shown
  in the Oxford and High Church development, the other a knocking down of ruins
  which could only end in some fresh erection springing up. As I have shown, my
  own position was that of a respectful materialist who entirely admitted a
  great central intelligent cause, without being able to distinguish what that
  cause was, or why it should work in so mysterious and terrible a way in
  bringing its designs to fulfilment.</p>

  <p>From my point of view the mind (and so far as I could see the soul, which
  was the total effect of all the hereditary or personal functionings of the
  mind) was an emanation from the brain and entirely physical in its nature. I
  saw, as a medical man, how a spicule of bone or a tumour pressing on the
  brain would cause what seemed an alteration in the soul. I saw also how drugs
  or alcohol would turn on fleeting phases of virtue or vice. The physical
  argument seemed an overpowering one. It had never struck me that the current
  of events might really flow in the opposite direction, and that the higher
  faculties could only manifest themselves imperfectly through an imperfect
  instrument. The broken fiddle is silent and yet the musician is the same as
  ever.</p>

  <p>The first thing which steadied me and made me reconsider my position was
  the question of telepathy, which was already being discussed by William
  Barrett and others, even before the appearance of Myers' monumental work on
  "Human Personality"&mdash;the first book which devoted to these psychic
  subjects the deep study and sustained brain power which they demand. It may,
  in my opinion, take a permanent place in human literature like the "Novum
  Organum" or "The Descent of Man" or any other great root-book which has
  marked a date in human thought. Having read some of the evidence I began to
  experiment in thought transference, and I found a fellow-researcher in Mr.
  Ball, a well-known architect in the town. Again and again, sitting behind
  him, I have drawn diagrams, and he in turn has made approximately the same
  figure. I showed beyond any doubt whatever that I could convey my thought
  without words.</p>

  <p>But if I could verify such conclusions up to six feet I could not well
  doubt them when they gave me the evidence that the same results could be
  obtained at a distance. With an appropriate subject, and some undefined
  sympathy between the two individuals, it was independent of space. So the
  evidence seemed to show. I had always sworn by science and by the need of
  fearless following wherever truth might lie. It was clear now that my
  position had been too rigid. I had compared the thought-excretion of the
  brain to the bile-excretion of the liver. Clearly this was untenable. If
  thought could go a thousand miles and produce a perceptible effect then it
  differed entirely not only in degree but in kind from any purely physical
  material. That seemed certain, and it must involve some modification of my
  old views.</p>

  <p>About this time (1886) the family of a General whom I attended
  professionally became interested in table turning and asked me to come and
  check their results. They sat round a dining-room table which after a time,
  their hands being upon it, began to sway and finally got sufficient motion to
  tap with one leg. They then asked questions and received answers, more or
  less wise and more or less to the point. They were got by the tedious process
  of reciting the alphabet and writing down the letter which the tap indicated.
  It seemed to me that we were collectively pushing the table, and that our own
  wills were concerned in bringing down the leg at the right moment. I was
  interested but very sceptical. Some of these messages were not vague
  platitudes but were definite and from dead friends of the family, which
  naturally impressed them greatly, though it had not the same effect upon me,
  since I did not know them. I have the old records before me as I write.
  "Don't tell the girls when you see them, but they will talk about me. Kiss my
  baby for me. I watch her always. Francie." This was the style of message,
  mixed up with a good many platitudes. We held twenty or more of such
  meetings, but I never received anything evidential to my own address, and I
  was very critical as to the whole proceedings.</p>

  <p>None the less there was a problem to be solved and I went on with its
  solution, reading the pros and the cons, and asking advice from those who had
  experience, especially from General Drayson, a very distinguished thinker and
  a pioneer of psychic knowledge, who lived at that time at Southsea. I had
  known Drayson first as an astronomer, for he had worked out a revolutionary
  idea by which there is a fatal mistake in our present idea as to the circle
  which is described in the heavens by the prolonged axis of the earth. It is
  really a wider circle round a different centre, and this correction enables
  us to explain several things now inexplicable, and to make astronomy a more
  exact science, with certain very important reactions upon geology and the
  recurrent glacial epochs, the exact date of which could be fixed. His views
  impressed me much at the time, and several books upholding them have appeared
  since his death, notably "Draysoniana" by Admiral de Horsey. If he makes
  good, as I think he will, Drayson will make a great permanent name. His
  opinion therefore was not negligible upon any subject, and when he told me
  his views and experiences on Spiritualism I could not fail to be impressed,
  though my own philosophy was far too solid to be easily destroyed. I was too
  poor to employ professional mediums, and to work on such subjects without a
  medium is as if one worked at astronomy without a telescope. Once only an old
  man with some reputed psychic power came for a small fee and gave us a
  demonstration. He went into a loud-breathing trance to the alarm of his
  audience, and then gave each of us a test. Mine was certainly a very
  remarkable one, for it was "Do not read Leigh Hunt's book." I was hesitating
  at the time whether I should read his "Comic Dramatists of the Restoration"
  or not, for on the one hand it is literature and on the other the treatment
  repelled me. This then was a very final and excellent test so far as
  telepathy went, but I would not fully grant that it was more. I was so
  impressed, however, that I wrote an account of it to "Light," the psychic
  weekly paper, and so in the year 1887 I actually put myself on public record
  as a student of these matters. That was thirty-seven years ago, as I write,
  so I am a very senior student now. From that time onwards I read and thought
  a great deal, though it was not until the later phase of my life that I
  realized whither all this was tending. This question I will treat in a final
  section by itself, so that those to whom it is of less interest can avoid
  it.</p>

  <p>I was deeply interested and attracted for a year or two by Theosophy,
  because while Spiritualism seemed at that time to be chaos so far as
  philosophy went, Theosophy presented a very well thought-out and reasonable
  scheme, parts of which, notably reincarnation and Kharma, seemed to offer an
  explanation for some of the anomalies of life. I read Sinnett's "Occult
  World" and afterwards with even greater admiration I read his fine exposition
  of Theosophy in "Esoteric Buddhism," a most notable book. I also met him, for
  he was an old friend of General Drayson's, and I was impressed by his
  conversation. Shortly afterwards, however, there appeared Dr. Hodgson's
  report upon his investigation into Madame Blavatsky's proceedings at Adyar,
  which shook my confidence very much. It is true that Mrs. Besant has since
  then published a powerful defence which tends to show that Hodgson may have
  been deceived, but the subsequent book, "A Priestess of Isis," which contains
  many of her own letters, leaves an unpleasant impression, and Sinnett's
  posthumous work seems to show that he also had lost confidence. On the other
  hand, Colonel Olcott shows that the woman undoubtedly had real psychic
  powers, whatever their source. As to Spiritualism, it seems to have only
  interested her in its lower phenomenal aspect. Her books show extraordinary
  erudition and capacity for hard work, even if they represent the transfer of
  other people's conclusions, as they frequently do. It would be unjust,
  however, to condemn the old wisdom simply because it was introduced by this
  extraordinary and volcanic person. We have also had in our branch of the
  occult many dishonest mediums, but we have hastened to unveil them where we
  could do so, and Theosophy will be in a stronger position when it shakes off
  Madame Blavatsky altogether. In any case it could never have met my needs for
  I ask for severe proof, and if I have to go back to unquestioning faith I
  should find myself in the fold from which I wandered.</p>

  <p>My life had been a pleasant one with my steadily-increasing literary
  success, my practice, which was enough to keep me pleasantly occupied, and my
  sport, which I treat in a later chapter. Suddenly, however, there came a
  development which shook me out of my rut, and caused an absolute change in my
  life and plans. One daughter, Mary, had been born to us, our household was a
  happy one, and as I have never had personal ambitions, since the simple
  things of life have always been the most pleasant to me, it is possible that
  I should have remained in Southsea permanently but for this new episode in my
  life. It arose when in 1890 Koch announced that he had discovered a sure cure
  for consumption and that he would demonstrate it upon a certain date in
  Berlin.</p>

  <p>A great urge came upon me suddenly that I should go to Berlin and see him
  do so. I could give no clear reason for this, but it was an irresistible
  impulse and I at once determined to go. Had I been a well-known doctor or a
  specialist in consumption it would have been more intelligible, but I had, as
  a matter of fact, no great interest in the more recent developments of my own
  profession, and a very strong belief that much of the so-called progress was
  illusory. However, at a few hours' notice I packed up a bag and started off
  alone upon this curious adventure. I had had an interchange of letters with
  Mr. W. T. Stead over some matter and I called upon him at the "Review of
  Reviews" office as I passed through London to ask him if he could give me an
  introduction to Koch or to Dr. Bergmann, who was to give the demonstration.
  Mr. Stead was very amiable to this big unknown provincial doctor, and he gave
  me a letter for the British Ambassador&mdash;Sir Edward Malet, if I remember
  right&mdash;and for Mr. Lowe, "The Times" correspondent. He also asked me to
  do a character sketch of Koch for him, adding that he would have Count Mattei
  as a feature of his magazine this month and Koch the next. I said, "Then you
  will have the greatest man of science and the greatest quack in Europe
  following each other." Stead glared at me angrily, for it seems that the
  Mattei treatment with its blue electricity and the rest of it was at that
  moment his particular fad. However, we parted amiably and all through his
  life we kept in distant touch, though we came into sharp collision at the
  time of the Boer war. He was a brave and honest man, and if he was impulsive
  at times it was only the sudden outflame of that fire which made him the
  great force for good that he was. In psychic knowledge he was a generation
  before his time, though his mode of expressing it may sometimes have been
  injudicious.</p>

  <p>I went on to Berlin that night and found myself in the Continental express
  with a very handsome and courteous London physician bound upon the same
  errand as myself. We, passed most of the night talking and I learned that his
  name was Malcolm Morris and that he also had been a provincial doctor, but
  that he had come to London and had made a considerable hit as a skin
  specialist in Harley Street. It was the beginning of a friendship which
  endured.</p>

  <p>Having arrived at Berlin the great thing was to be present at Bergmann's
  demonstration, which was to be next day at twelve. I went to our Ambassador,
  was kept long waiting, had a chilly reception and was dismissed without help
  or consolation. Then I tried "The Times" correspondent, but he could not help
  me either. He and his amiable wife showed me every courtesy and invited me to
  dinner that night. Tickets were simply not to be had and neither money nor
  interest could procure them. I conceived the wild idea of getting one from
  Koch himself and made my way to his house. While there I had the curious
  experience of seeing his mail arrive&mdash;a large sack full of letters,
  which was emptied out on the floor of the hall, and exhibited every sort of
  stamp in Europe. It was a sign of all the sad broken lives and wearied hearts
  which were turning in hope to Berlin. Koch remained a veiled prophet,
  however, and would see neither me nor any one else. I was fairly at my wits'
  ends and could not imagine how I could attain my end.</p>

  <p>Next day I went down to the great building where the address was to be
  given and managed by bribing the porter to get into the outer Hall. The huge
  audience was assembling in a room beyond. I tried further bribing that I
  might be slipped in, but the official became abusive. People streamed past
  me, but I was always the waiter at the gate. Finally every one had gone in
  and then a group of men came bustling across, Bergmann, bearded and
  formidable, in the van, with a tail of house surgeons and satellites behind
  him. I threw myself across his path. "I have come a thousand miles," said I.
  "May I not come in?" He halted and glared at me through his spectacles.
  "Perhaps you would like to take my place," he roared, working himself up into
  that strange folly of excitement which seems so strange in the heavy German
  nature. "That is the only place left. Yes, yes, take my place by all. means.
  My classes are filled with Englishmen already." He fairly spat out the word
  "Englishmen" and I learned afterwards that some recent Quarrel with Morel
  MacKenzie over the illness of the Emperor Frederick had greatly incensed him.
  I am glad to say that I kept my temper and my polite manner, which is always
  the best shield when one is met by brutal rudeness. "Not at all," I said. "I
  would not intrude, if there was really no room." He glared at me again, all
  beard and spectacles, and rushed on with his court all grinning at the snub
  which the presumptuous Englishman had received. One of them lingered,
  however&mdash;a kindly American. "That was bad behaviour," said he. "See
  here! If you meet me at four this afternoon I will show you my full notes of
  the lecture, and I know the cases he is about to show, so we can see them
  together to-morrow." Then he followed on.</p>

  <p>So it came about that I attained my end after all, but in a roundabout
  way. I studied the lecture and the cases, and I had the temerity to disagree
  with every one and to come to the conclusion that the whole thing was
  experimental and premature. A wave of madness had seized the world and from
  all parts, notably from England, poor afflicted people were rushing to Berlin
  for a cure, some of them in such advanced stages of disease that they died in
  the train. I felt so sure of my ground and so strongly about it that I wrote
  a letter of warning to "The Daily Telegraph," and I rather think that this
  letter was the very first which appeared upon the side of doubt and caution.
  I need not say that the event proved the truth of my forecast.</p>

  <p>Two days later I was back in Southsea, but I came back a changed man. I
  had spread my wings and had felt something of the powers within me.
  Especially I had been influenced by a long talk with Malcolm Morris, in which
  he assured me that I was wasting my life in the provinces and had too small a
  field for my activities. He insisted that I should leave general practice and
  go to London. I answered that I was by no means sure of my literary success
  as yet, and that I could not so easily abandon the medical career which had
  cost my mother such sacrifices and myself so many years of study. He asked me
  if there was any special branch of the profession on which I could
  concentrate so as to get away from general practice. I said that of late
  years I had been interested in eye work and had amused myself by correcting
  refractions and ordering glasses in the Portsmouth Eye Hospital under Mr.
  Vernon Ford. "Well," said Morris, "why not specialize upon the eye? Go to
  Vienna, put in six months' work, come back and start in London. Thus you will
  have a nice clean life with plenty of leisure for your literature." I came
  home with this great suggestion buzzing in my head and as my wife was quite
  willing and Mary, my little girl, was old enough now to be left with her
  grandmother, there seemed to be no obstacle in the way. There were no
  difficulties about disposing of the practice, for it was so small and so
  purely personal that it could not be sold to another and simply had to
  dissolve.</p>

  <p>The Portsmouth Literary and Scientific Society gave me a God-speed
  banquet. I have many pleasant and some comic reminiscences of this Society,
  of which I had been secretary for several years. We kept the sacred flame
  burning in the old city with our weekly papers and discussions during the
  long winters. It was there I learned to face an audience, which proved to be
  of the first importance for my life's work. I was naturally of a very
  nervous, backward, self-distrustful disposition in such things and I have
  been told that the signal that I was about to join in the discussion was that
  the whole long bench on which I sat, with every one on it, used to shake with
  my emotion. But once up I learned to speak out, to conceal my trepidations,
  and to choose my phrases. I gave three papers, one on the Arctic seas, one on
  Carlyle and one on Gibbon. The former gave me a quite unmerited reputation as
  a sportsman, for I borrowed from a local taxidermist every bird and beast
  that he possessed which could conceivably find its way into the Arctic
  Circle. These I piled upon the lecture table, and the audience, concluding
  that I had shot them all, looked upon me with great respect. Next morning
  they were back with the taxidermist once more. We had some weird people and
  incidents at these debates. I remember one very learned discussion on fossils
  and the age of the strata, which was ended by a cadaverous major-general of
  the Evangelical persuasion who rose and said in a hollow voice that all this
  speculation was vain, and indeed incomprehensible, since we knew on an
  authority which could not possibly be questioned that the world was made
  exactly five thousand eight hundred and ninety years ago. This put the lid on
  the debate and we all crept home to bed.</p>

  <p>My political work also caused me to learn to speak. I was what was called
  a Liberal-Unionist, that is, a man whose general position was Liberal, but
  who could not see his way to support Gladstone's Irish Policy. Perhaps we
  were wrong. However, that was my view at the time. I had a dreadful first
  experience of platform speaking on a large scale, for at a huge meeting at
  the Amphitheatre the candidate, Sir William Cross-man, was delayed, and to
  prevent a fiasco I was pushed on at a moment's notice to face an audience of
  3,000 people. It was one of the tight corners of my life. I hardly knew
  myself what I said, but the Irish part of me came to my aid and supplied me
  with a torrent of more or less incoherent words and similes which roused the
  audience greatly, though it read to me afterwards more like a comic stump
  speech than a serious political effort. But it was what they wanted and they
  were mostly on their feet before I finished. I was amazed when I read it next
  day, and especially the last crowning sentence, which was: "England and
  Ireland are wedded together with the sapphire wedding ring of the sea, and
  what God has placed together let no man pluck asunder." It was not very good
  logic, but whether it was eloquence or rhodomontade I could not even now
  determine.</p>

  <p>I was acting Secretary when Mr. Balfour came down to address a great
  meeting, and, as such, when the Hall was full, I waited on the curb outside
  to receive him. Presently his carriage drove up and out he stepped, tall,
  thin and aristocratic. There were two notorious partisans of the other side
  waiting for him and I warned them not to make trouble. However, the moment
  Balfour appeared one of them opened a huge mouth with the intention of
  emitting a howl of execration. But it never got out, for I clapped my hand
  pretty forcibly over the orifice while I held him by the neck with the other
  hand. His companion hit me on the head with a stick, and was promptly knocked
  down by one of my companions. Meanwhile Balfour got safely in, and we two
  secretaries followed, rather dishevelled after our adventure. I met Lord
  Balfour several times in after life but I never told him how I once had my
  hat smashed in his defence.</p>

  <p>What with the Literary Society and the politicians I left a gap behind me
  in Portsmouth and so did my wife, who was universally popular for her amiable
  and generous character. It was a wrench to us to leave so many good friends.
  However, towards the end of 1890 the die was cast, and we closed the door of
  Bush Villa behind us for the last time. I had days of privation there, and
  days of growing success during the eight long years that I had spent in
  Portsmouth. Now it was with a sense of wonderful freedom and exhilarating
  adventure that we set forth upon the next phase of our lives.</p>

  <p class="first">WE set forth upon a bitter winter day at the close of 1890
  with every chance of being snowed up on our long trek. We got through all
  right, however, and found ourselves in Vienna, arriving on a deadly cold
  night, with deep snow under foot and a cutting blizzard in the air. As we
  looked from the station the electric lights threw out the shining silver
  drift of snow-flakes against the absolute darkness of the sky. It was a
  gloomy, ominous reception, but half an hour afterwards when we were in the
  warm cosy crowded tobacco-laden restaurant attached to our hotel we took a
  more cheerful view of our surroundings.</p>

  <p>We found a modest <i>pension</i> which was within our means, and we put in
  a very pleasant four months, during which I attended eye lectures at the
  Krankenhaus, but could certainly have learned far more in London, for even if
  one has a fair knowledge of conversational German it is very different from
  following accurately a rapid lecture filled with technical terms. No doubt
  "has studied in Vienna" sounds well in a specialist's record, but it is
  usually taken for granted that he has exhausted his own country before going
  abroad, which was by no means the case with me. Therefore, so far as eye work
  goes, my winter was wasted, nor can I trace any particular spiritual or
  intellectual advance. On the other hand I saw a little of gay Viennese
  society. I received kind and welcome hospitality from Brinsley Richards, "The
  Times" correspondent, and his wife, and I had some excellent skating. I also
  wrote one short book, "The Doings of Raffles Haw," not a very notable
  achievement, by which I was able to pay my current expenses without
  encroaching on the very few hundred pounds which were absolutely all that I
  had in the world. This money was invested on the advice of a friend, and as
  it was almost all lost&mdash;like so much more that I have earned&mdash;it is
  just as well that I was never driven back upon it.</p>

  <p>With the spring my work at Vienna had finished, if it can be said to have
  ever begun, and we returned via Paris, putting in a few days there with
  Landolt, who was the most famous French oculist of his time. It was great to
  find ourselves back in London once more with the feeling that we were now on
  the real field of battle, where we must conquer or perish, for our boats were
  burned behind us. It is easy now to look back and think that the issue was
  clear, but it was by no means so at the time, for I had earned little, though
  my reputation was growing. It was only my own inward conviction of the
  permanent merits of "The White Company," still appearing month by month in
  "Cornhill," which sustained my confidence. I had come through so much in the
  early days at Southsea that nothing could alarm me personally, but I had a
  wife and child now, and the stern simplicity of life which was possible and
  even pleasant in early days was now no longer to be thought of.</p>

  <p>We took rooms in Montague Place, and I went forth to search for some place
  where I could put up my plate as an oculist. I was aware that many of the big
  men do not find time to work out refractions, which in some cases of
  astigmatism take a long time to adjust when done by retinoscopy. I was
  capable in this work and liked it, so I hoped that some of it might drift my
  way. But to get it, it was clearly necessary that I should live among the big
  men so that the patient could be easily referred to me. I searched the
  doctors' quarters and at last found suitable accommodation at 2 Devonshire
  Place, which is at the top of Wimpole Street and close to the classical
  Harley Street. There for £120 a year I got the use of a front room with part
  use of a waiting-room. I was soon to find that they were both waiting-rooms,
  and now I know that it was better so.</p>

  <p>Every morning I walked from the lodgings at Montague Place, reached my
  consulting-room at ten and sat there until three or four, with never a ring
  to disturb my serenity. Could better conditions for reflection and work be
  found? It was ideal, and so long as I was thoroughly unsuccessful in my
  professional venture there was every chance of improvement in my literary
  prospects Therefore when I returned to the lodgings at tea-time I bore my
  little sheaves with me, the first-fruits of a considerable harvest.</p>

  <p>A number of monthly magazines were coming out at that time, notable among
  which was "The Strand," then as now under the editorship of Greenhough Smith.
  Considering these various journals with their disconnected stories it had
  struck me that a single character running through a series, if it only
  engaged the attention of the reader, would bind that reader to that
  particular magazine. On the other hand, it had long seemed to me that the
  ordinary serial might be an impediment rather than a help to a magazine,
  since, sooner or later, one missed one number and afterwards it had lost all
  interest. Clearly the ideal compromise was a character which carried through,
  and yet instalments which were each complete in themselves, so that the
  purchaser was always sure that he could relish the whole contents of the
  magazine. I believe that I was the first to realize this and "The Strand
  Magazine" the first to put it into practice.</p>

  <p>Looking round for my central character I felt that Sherlock Holmes, whom I
  had already handled in two little books, would easily lend himself to a
  succession of short stories. These I began in the long hours of waiting in my
  consulting-room. Greenhough Smith liked them from the first, and encouraged
  me to go ahead with them. My literary affairs had been taken up by that king
  of agents, A. P. Watt, who relieved me of all the hateful bargaining, and
  handled things so well that any immediate anxiety for money soon disappeared.
  It was as well, for not one single patient had ever crossed the threshold of
  my room.</p>

  <p>I was now once more at a crossroads of my life, and Providence, which I
  recognize at every step, made me realize it in a very energetic and
  unpleasant way. I was starting off for my usual trudge one morning from our
  lodgings when icy shivers passed over me, and I only got back in time to
  avoid a total collapse. It was a virulent attack of influenza, at a time when
  influenza was in its deadly prime. Only three years before my dear sister
  Annette, after spending her whole life on the family needs, had died of it at
  Lisbon at the very moment when my success would have enabled me to recall her
  from her long servitude. Now it was my turn, and I very nearly followed her.
  I can remember no pain or extreme discomfort, and no psychic experiences, but
  for a week I was in great danger, and then found myself as weak as a child
  and as emotional, but with a mind as clear as crystal. It was then, as I
  surveyed my own life, that I saw how foolish I was to waste my literary
  earnings in keeping up an oculist's room in Wimpole Street, and I determined
  with a wild rush of joy to cut the painter and to trust for ever to my power
  of writing. I remember in my delight taking the handkerchief which lay upon
  the coverlet in my enfeebled hand, and tossing it up to the ceiling in my
  exultation.</p>

  <p>I should at last be my own master. No longer would I have to conform to
  professional dress or try to please any one else. I would be free to live how
  I liked and where I liked. It was one of the great moments of exultation of
  my life. The date was in August, 1891.</p>

  <p>Presently I was about, hobbling on a stick and reflecting that if I lived
  to be eighty I knew already exactly how it would feel. I haunted
  house-agents, got lists of suburban villas, and spent some weeks, as my
  strength returned, in searching for a new home. Finally I found a suitable
  house, modest but comfortable, isolated and yet one of a row. It was 12
  Tennison Road, South Norwood. There we settled down, and there I made my
  first effort to live entirely by my pen. It soon became evident that I had
  been playing the game well within my powers and that I should have no
  difficulty in providing a sufficient income. It seemed as if I had settled
  into a life which might be continuous, and I little foresaw that an
  unexpected blow was about to fall upon us, and that we were not at the end,
  but really at the beginning, of our wanderings.</p>

  <p>I could not know this, however, and I settled down with a stout heart to
  do some literary work worthy of the name. The difficulty of the Holmes work
  was that every story really needed as clear-cut and original a plot as a
  longish book would do. One cannot without effort spin plots at such a rate.
  They are apt to become thin or to break. I was determined, now that I had no
  longer the excuse of absolute pecuniary pressure, never again to write
  anything which was not as good as I could possibly make it, and therefore I
  would not write a Holmes story without a worthy plot and without a problem
  which interested my own mind, for that is the first requisite before you can
  interest any one else. If I have been able to sustain this character for a
  long time and if the public find, as they will find, that the last story is
  as good as the first, it is entirely due to the fact that I never, or hardly
  ever, forced a story. Some have thought there was a falling off in the
  stories, and the criticism was neatly expressed by a Cornish boatman who said
  to me, "I think, sir, when Holmes fell over that cliff, he may not have
  killed himself, but all the same he was never quite the same man afterwards."
  I think, however, that if the reader began the series backwards, so that he
  brought a fresh mind to the last stories, he would agree with me that, though
  the general average may not be conspicuously high, still the last one is as
  good as the first.</p>

  <p>I was weary, however, of inventing plots and I set myself now to do some
  work which would certainly be less remunerative but would be more ambitious
  from a literary point of view. I had long been attracted by the epoch of
  Louis XIV and by those Huguenots who were the French equivalents of our
  Puritans. I had a good knowledge of the memoirs of that date, and many notes
  already prepared, so that it did not take me long to write "The Refugees." It
  has stood the acid test of time very well, so I may say that it was a
  success. Soon after its appearance it was translated into French, and my dear
  old mother, herself a great French scholar, had the joy when she visited
  Fontainebleau to hear the official guide tell the drove of tourists that if
  they really wanted to know about the Court of the great monarch, they would
  find the clearest and most accurate account in an Englishman's book, "The
  Refugees." I expect the guide would have been considerably astonished had he
  then and there been kissed by an elderly English lady, but it was an
  experience which he must have narrowly missed. I used in this book, also, a
  great deal which was drawn from Parkman, that great but neglected historian,
  who was in my opinion the greatest serious writer that America has
  produced.</p>

  <p>There was an amusing episode connected with "The Refugees," when it was
  read aloud in some strict Irish convent, the innocent Reverend Mother having
  mistaken my name and imagined that I was a canon, and therefore of course a
  holy man. I am told that the reading was a tremendous success and that the
  good sisters rejoiced that the mistake was not found out until the story was
  completed. My first name has several times led to mistakes, as when, at a big
  dinner at Chicago, I was asked to say Grace, as being the only ecclesiastic
  present. I remember that at the same dinner one of the speakers remarked that
  it was a most sinister fact that though I was a doctor no <i>living</i>
  patient of mine had ever yet been seen.</p>

  <p>During this Norwood interval, I was certainly working hard, for besides
  "The Refugees" I wrote "The Great Shadow," a booklet which I should put near
  the front of my work for merit, and two other little books on a very inferior
  plane&mdash;"The Parasite" and "Beyond the City." The latter was of a
  domestic type unusual for me. It was pirated in New York just before the New
  Copyright Act came into force, and the rascal publisher thinking that a
  portrait&mdash;any sort of portrait&mdash;of the author would look well upon
  the cover, and being quite ignorant of my identity, put a very pretty and
  over-dressed young woman as my presentment. I still preserve a copy of this
  most flattering representation. All these books had some decent success,
  though none of it was remarkable. It was still the Sherlock Holmes stories
  for which the public clamoured, and these from time to time I endeavoured to
  supply. At last, after I had done two series of them I saw that I was in
  danger of having my hand forced, and of being entirely identified with what I
  regarded as a lower stratum of literary achievement. Therefore as a sign of
  my resolution I determined to end the life of my hero. The idea was in my
  mind when I went with my wife for a short holiday in Switzerland, in the
  course of which we saw there the wonderful falls of Reichenbach, a terrible
  place, and one that I thought would make a worthy tomb for poor Sherlock,
  even if I buried my banking account along with him. So there I laid him,
  fully determined that he should stay there&mdash;as indeed for some years he
  did. I was amazed at the concern expressed by the public. They say that a man
  is never properly appreciated until he is dead, and the general protest
  against my summary execution of Holmes taught me how many and how numerous
  were his friends. "You Brute" was the beginning of the letter of remonstrance
  which one lady sent me, and I expect she spoke for others besides herself. I
  heard of many who wept. I fear I was utterly callous myself, and only glad to
  have a chance of opening out into new fields of imagination, for the
  temptation of high prices made it difficult to get one's thoughts away from
  Holmes.</p>

  <p>That Sherlock Holmes was anything but mythical to many is shown by the
  fact that I have had many letters addressed to him with requests that I
  forward them. Watson has also had a number of letters in which he has been
  asked for the address or for the autograph of his more brilliant confrère. A
  press-cutting agency wrote to Watson asking whether Holmes would not wish to
  subscribe. When Holmes retired several elderly ladies were ready to keep
  house for him and one sought to ingratiate herself by assuring me that she
  knew all about bee-keeping and could "segregate the queen." I had
  considerable offers also for Holmes if he would examine and solve various
  family mysteries. Once the offer&mdash;from Poland&mdash;was that I should
  myself go, and my reward was practically left to my own judgment. I had
  judgment enough, however, to avoid it altogether.</p>

  <p>I have often been asked whether I had myself the qualities which I
  depicted, or whether I was merely the Watson that I look. Of course I am well
  aware that it is one thing to grapple with a practical problem and quite
  another thing when you are allowed to solve it under your own conditions. I
  have no delusions about that. At the same time a man cannot spin a character
  out of his own inner consciousness and make it really life-like unless he has
  some possibilities of that character within him&mdash;which is a dangerous
  admission for one who has drawn so many villains as I. In my poem "The Inner
  Room," describing our multiplex personality, I say:</p>

  <p class="poem">"There are others who are sitting,<br>
  Grim as doom,<br>
  In the dim ill-boding shadow<br>
  Of my room.<br>
  Darkling figures, stern or quaint,<br>
  Now a savage, now a saint,<br>
  Showing fitfully and faint<br>
  In the gloom."</p>

  <p>Among those figures there may perhaps be an astute detective also, but I
  find that in real life in order to find him I have to inhibit all the others
  and get into a mood when there is no one in the room but he. Then I get
  results and have several times solved problems by Holmes' methods after the
  police have been baffled. Yet I must admit that in ordinary life I am by no
  means observant and that I have to throw myself into an artificial frame of
  mind before I can weigh evidence and anticipate the sequence of events.</p>

  Holmes&mdash;Holmes on the Films&mdash;Methods of
  Construction&mdash;Problems&mdash;Curious Letters&mdash;Some Personal
  Cases&mdash;Strange Happenings.</p><br>

  <p class="first">I MAY as well interrupt my narrative here in order to say
  what may interest my readers about my most notorious character.</p>

  <p>The impression that Holmes was a real person of flesh and blood may have
  been intensified by his frequent appearance upon the stage. After the
  withdrawal of my dramatization of "Rodney Stone" from a theatre upon which I
  held a six months' lease, I determined to play a bold and energetic game, for
  an empty theatre spells ruin. When I saw the course that things were taking I
  shut myself up and devoted my whole mind to making a sensational Sherlock
  Holmes drama. I wrote it in a week and called it "The Speckled Band" after
  the short story of that name. I do not think that I exaggerate if I say that
  within a fortnight of the one play shutting down I had a company working upon
  the rehearsals of a second one, which had been written in the interval. It
  was a considerable success. Lyn Harding, as the half epileptic and wholly
  formidable Doctor Grimesby Rylott, was most masterful, while Saintsbury as
  Sherlock Holmes was also very good. Before the end of the run I had cleared
  off all that I had lost upon the other play, and I had created a permanent
  property of some value. It became a stock piece and is even now touring the
  country. We had a fine rock boa to play the title-rôle, a snake which was the
  pride of my heart, so one can imagine my disgust when I saw that one critic
  ended his disparaging review by the words "The crisis of the play was
  produced by the appearance of a palpably artificial serpent." I was inclined
  to offer him a goodly sum if he would undertake to go to bed with it. We had
  several snakes at different times, but they were none of them born actors and
  they were all inclined either to hang down from the hole in the wall like
  inanimate bell-pulls, or else to turn back through the hole and get even with
  the stage carpenter who pinched their tails in order to make them more
  lively. Finally we used artificial snakes, and every one, including the stage
  carpenter, agreed that it was more satisfactory.</p>

  <p>This was the second Sherlock Holmes play. I should have spoken about the
  first, which was produced very much earlier, in fact at the time of the
  African war. It was written and most wonderfully acted by William Gillette,
  the famous American. Since he used my characters and to some extent my plots,
  he naturally gave me a share in the undertaking, which proved to be very
  successful. "May I marry Holmes?" was one cable which I received from him
  when in the throes of composition. "You may marry or murder or do what you
  like with him," was my heartless reply. I was charmed both with the play, the
  acting and the pecuniary result. I think that every man with a drop of
  artistic blood in his veins would agree that the latter consideration, though
  very welcome when it does arrive, is still the last of which he thinks.</p>

  <p>Sir James Barrie paid his respects to Sherlock Holmes in a rollicking
  parody. It was really a gay gesture of resignation over the failure which we
  had encountered with a comic opera for which he undertook to write the
  libretto. I collaborated with him on this, but in spite of our joint efforts,
  the piece fell flat. Whereupon Barrie sent me a parody on Holmes, written on
  the fly leaves of one of his books. It ran thus:&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p style="text-align: center">THE ADVENTURE OF THE TWO COLLABORATORS</p>

  <p>In bringing to a close the adventures of my friend Sherlock Holmes I am
  perforce reminded that he never, save on the occasion which, as you will now
  hear, brought his singular career to an end, consented to act in any mystery
  which was concerned with persons who made a livelihood by their pen. "I am
  not particular about the people I mix among for business purposes," he would
  say, "but at literary characters I draw the line."</p>

  <p>We were in our rooms in Baker Street one evening. I was (I remember) by
  the centre table writing out "The Adventure of the Man without a Cork Leg"
  (which had so puzzled the Royal Society and all the other scientific bodies
  of Europe), and Holmes was amusing himself with a little revolver practice.
  It was his custom of a summer evening to fire round my head, just shaving my
  face, until he had made a photograph of me on the opposite wall, and it is a
  slight proof of his skill that many of these portraits in pistol shots are
  considered admirable likenesses.</p>

  <p>I happened to look out of the window, and perceiving two gentlemen
  advancing rapidly along Baker Street asked him who they were. He immediately
  lit his pipe, and, twisting himself on a chair into the figure 8,
  replied:</p>

  <p>"They are two collaborators in comic opera, and their play has not been a
  triumph."</p>

  <p>I sprang from my chair to the ceiling in amazement, and he then
  explained:</p>

  <p>"My dear Watson, they are obviously men who follow some low calling. That
  much even you should be able to read in their faces. Those little pieces of
  blue paper which they fling angrily from them are Durrant's Press Notices. Of
  these they have obviously hundreds about their person (see how their pockets
  bulge). They would not dance on them if they were pleasant reading."</p>

  <p>I again sprang to the ceiling (which is much dented), and shouted:
  "Amazing! but they may be mere authors."</p>

  <p>"No," said Holmes, "for mere authors only get one press notice a week.
  Only criminals, dramatists and actors get them by the hundred."</p>

  <p>"Then they may be actors."</p>

  <p>"No, actors would come in a carriage."</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me anything else about them?"</p>

  <p>"A great deal. From the mud on the boots of the tall one I perceive that
  he comes from South Norwood. The other is as obviously a Scotch author."</p>

  <p>"How can you tell that?"</p>

  <p>"He is carrying in his pocket a book called (I clearly see) 'Auld Licht
  Something.' Would any one but the author be likely to carry about a book with
  such a title?"</p>

  <p>I had to confess that this was improbable.</p>

  <p>It was now evident that the two men (if such they can be called) were
  seeking our lodgings. I have said (often) that my friend Holmes seldom gave
  way to emotion of any kind, but he now turned livid with passion. Presently
  this gave place to a strange look of triumph.</p>

  <p>"Watson," he said, "that big fellow has for years taken the credit for my
  most remarkable doings, but at last I have him&mdash;at last!"</p>

  <p>Up I went to the ceiling, and when I returned the strangers were in the
  room.</p>

  <p>"I perceive, gentlemen," said Mr. Sherlock Holmes, "that you are at
  present afflicted by an extraordinary novelty."</p>

  <p>The handsomer of our visitors asked in amazement how he knew this, but the
  big one only scowled.</p>

  <p>"You forget that you wear a ring on your fourth finger," replied Mr.
  Holmes calmly.</p>

  <p>I was about to jump to the ceiling when the big brute interposed.</p>

  <p>"That Tommy-rot is all very well for the public, Holmes," said he, "but
  you can drop it before me. And, Watson, if you go up to the ceiling again I
  shall make you stay there."</p>

  <p>Here I observed a curious phenomenon. My friend Sherlock Holmes
  <i>shrank</i>. He became small before my eyes. I looked longingly at the
  ceiling, but dared not.</p>

  <p>"Let us cut the first four pages," said the big man, "and proceed to
  business. I want to know why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Allow me," said Mr. Holmes, with some of his old courage. "You want to
  know why the public does not go to your opera."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said the other ironically, "as you perceive by my shirt stud."
  He added more gravely, "And as you can only find out in one way I must insist
  on your witnessing an entire performance of the piece."</p>

  <p>It was an anxious moment for me. I shuddered, for I knew that if Holmes
  went I should have to go with him. But my friend had a heart of gold.
  "Never," he cried fiercely, "I will do anything for you save that."</p>

  <p>"Your continued existence depends on it," said the big man menacingly.</p>

  <p>"I would rather melt into air," replied Holmes, proudly taking another
  chair. "But I can tell you why the public don't go to your piece without
  sitting the thing out myself."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because," replied Holmes calmly, "they prefer to stay away."</p>

  <p>A dead silence followed that extraordinary remark. For a moment the two
  intruders gazed with awe upon the man who had unravelled their mystery so
  wonderfully. Then drawing their knives&mdash;</p>

  <p>Holmes grew less and less, until nothing was left save a ring of smoke
  which slowly circled to the ceiling.</p>

  <p>The last words of great men are often noteworthy. These were the last
  words of Sherlock Holmes: "Fool, fool! I have kept you in luxury for years.
  By my help you have ridden extensively in cabs, where no author was ever seen
  before. <i>Henceforth you will ride in buses!</i>"</p>

  <p>The brute sunk into a chair aghast.</p>

  <p>The other author did not turn a hair.</p>

  <p><i>To A. Conan Doyle,<br>
  from his friend<br>
  J. M. Barrie.</i></p><br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>This parody, the best of all the numerous parodies, may be taken as an
  example not only of the author's wit but of his debonnaire courage, for it
  was written immediately after our joint failure which at the moment was a
  bitter thought for both of us. There is indeed nothing more miserable than a
  theatrical failure, for you feel how many others who have backed you have
  been affected by it. It was, I am glad to say, my only experience of it, and
  I have no doubt that Barrie could say the same.</p>

  <p>Before I leave the subject of the many impersonations of Holmes I may say
  that all of them, and all the drawings, are very unlike my own original idea
  of the man. I saw him as very tall&mdash;"over 6 feet, but so excessively
  lean that he seemed considerably taller," said "A Study in Scarlet." He had,
  as I imagined him, a thin razor-like face, with a great hawks-bill of a nose,
  and two small eyes, set close together on either side of it. Such was my
  conception. It chanced, however, that poor Sidney Paget who, before his
  premature death, drew all the original pictures, had a younger brother whose
  name, I think, was Walter, who served him as a model. The handsome Walter
  took the place of the more powerful but uglier Sherlock, and perhaps from the
  point of view of my lady readers it was as well. The stage has followed the
  type set up by the pictures.</p>

  <p>Films of course were unknown when the stories appeared, and when these
  rights were finally discussed and a small sum offered for them by a French
  Company it seemed treasure trove and I was very glad to accept. Afterwards I
  had to buy them back again at exactly ten times what I had received, so the
  deal was a disastrous one. But now they have been done by the Stoll Company
  with Eille Norwood as Holmes, and it was worth all the expense to get so fine
  a production. Norwood has since played the part on the stage and won the
  approbation of the London public. He has that rare quality which can only be
  described as glamour, which compels you to watch an actor eagerly even when
  he is doing nothing. He has the brooding eye which excites expectation and he
  has also a quite unrivalled power of disguise. My only criticism of the films
  is that they introduce telephones, motor cars and other luxuries of which the
  Victorian Holmes never dreamed.</p>

  <p>People have often asked me whether I knew the end of a Holmes story before
  I started it. Of course I do. One could not possibly steer a course if one
  did not know one's destination. The first thing is to get your idea. Having
  got that key idea one's next task is to conceal it and lay emphasis upon
  everything which can make for a different explanation. Holmes, however, can
  see all the fallacies of the alternatives, and arrives more or less
  dramatically at the true solution by steps which he can describe and justify.
  He shows his powers by what the South Americans now call "Sherlockholmitos,"
  which means clever little deductions, which often have nothing to do with the
  matter in hand, but impress the reader with a general sense of power. The
  same effect is gained by his offhand allusion to other cases. Heaven knows
  how many titles I have thrown about in a casual way, and how many readers
  have begged me to satisfy their curiosity as to "Rigoletto and his abominable
  wife," "The Adventure of the Tired Captain," or "The Curious Experience of
  the Patterson Family in the Island of Uffa." Once or twice, as in "The
  Adventure of the Second Stain," which in my judgment is one of the neatest of
  the stories, I did actually use the title years before I wrote a story to
  correspond.</p>

  <p>There are some questions concerned with particular stories which turn up
  periodically from every quarter of the globe. In "The Adventure of the Priory
  School" Holmes remarks in his offhand way that by looking at a bicycle track
  on a damp moor one can say which way it was heading. I had so many
  remonstrances upon this point, varying from pity to anger, that I took out my
  bicycle and tried. I had imagined that the observations of the way in which
  the track of the hind wheel overlaid the track of the front one when the
  machine was not running dead straight would show the direction. I found that
  my correspondents were right and I was wrong, for this would be the same
  whichever way the cycle was moving. On the other hand the real solution was
  much simpler, for on an undulating moor the wheels make a much deeper
  impression uphill and a more shallow one downhill, so Holmes was justified of
  his wisdom after all.</p>

  <p>Sometimes I have got upon dangerous ground where I have taken risks
  through my own want of knowledge of the correct atmosphere. I have, for
  example, never been a racing man, and yet I ventured to write "Silver Blaze,"
  in which the mystery depends upon the laws of training and racing. The story
  is all right, and Holmes may have been at the top of his form, but my
  ignorance cries aloud to heaven. I read an excellent and very damaging
  criticism of the story in some sporting paper, written clearly by a man who
  <i>did</i> know, in which he explained the exact penalties which would have
  come upon every one concerned if they had acted as I described. Half would
  have been in jail and the other half warned off the turf for ever. However, I
  have never been nervous about details, and one must be masterful sometimes.
  When an alarmed Editor wrote to me once: "There is no second line of rails at
  that point," I answered, "I make one." On the other hand, there are cases
  where accuracy is essential.</p>

  <p>I do not wish to be ungrateful to Holmes, who has been a good friend to me
  in many ways. If I have sometimes been inclined to weary of him it is because
  his character admits of no light or shade. He is a calculating machine, and
  anything you add to that simply weakens the effect. Thus the variety of the
  stories must depend upon the romance and compact handling of the plots. I
  would say a word for Watson also, who in the course of seven volumes never
  shows one gleam of humour or makes one single joke. To make a real character
  one must sacrifice everything to consistency and remember Goldsmith's
  criticism of Johnson that "he would make the little fishes talk like
  whales."</p>

  <p>I do not think that I ever realized what a living actual personality
  Holmes had become to the more guileless readers, until I heard of the very
  pleasing story of the char-à-banc of French schoolboys who, when asked what
  they wanted to see first in London, replied unanimously that they wanted to
  see Mr. Holmes' lodgings in Baker Street. Many have asked me which house it
  is, but that is a point which for excellent reasons I will not decide.</p>

  <p>There are certain Sherlock Holmes stories, apocryphal I need not say,
  which go round and round the press and turn up at fixed intervals with the
  regularity of a comet.</p>

  <p>One is the story of the cabman who is supposed to have taken me to an
  hotel in Paris. "Dr. Doyle," he cried, gazing at me fixedly, "I perceive from
  your appearance that you have been recently at Constantinople. I have reason
  to think also that you have been at Buda, and I perceive some indication that
  you were not far from Milan." "Wonderful. Five francs for the secret of how
  you did it?" "I looked at the labels pasted on your trunk," said the astute
  cabby.</p>

  <p>Another perennial is of the woman who is said to have consulted Sherlock.
  "I am greatly puzzled, sir. In one week I have lost a motor horn, a brush, a
  box of golf balls, a dictionary and a bootjack. Can you explain it?" "Nothing
  simpler, madame," said Sherlock. "It is clear that your neighbour keeps a
  goat."</p>

  <p>There was a third about how Sherlock entered heaven, and by virtue of his
  power of observation at once greeted Adam, but the point is perhaps too
  anatomical for further discussion.</p>

  <p>I suppose that every author receives a good many curious letters.
  Certainly I have done so. Quite a number of these have been from Russia. When
  they have been in the vernacular I have been compelled to take them as read,
  but when they have been in English they have been among the most curious in
  my collection.</p>

  <p>There was one young lady who began all her epistles with the words "Good
  Lord." Another had a large amount of guile underlying her simplicity. Writing
  from Warsaw, she stated that she had been bedridden for two years, and that
  my novels had been her only, etc., etc. So touched was I by this flattering
  statement that I at once prepared an autographed parcel of them to complete
  the fair invalid's collection. By good luck, however, I met a brother author
  on the same day to whom I recounted the touching incident. With a cynical
  smile, he drew an identical letter from his pocket.</p>

  <p>His novels had also been for two years her only, etc., etc. I do not know
  how many more the lady had written to; but if, as I imagine, her
  correspondence had extended to several countries, she must have amassed a
  rather interesting library.</p>

  <p>The young Russian's habit of addressing me as "Good Lord" had an even
  stranger parallel at home which links it up with the subject of this article.
  Shortly after I received a knighthood, I had a bill from a tradesman which
  was quite correct and businesslike in every detail save that it was made out
  to Sir Sherlock Holmes. I hope that I can stand a joke as well as my
  neighbours, but this particular piece of humour seemed rather misapplied and
  I wrote sharply upon the subject.</p>

  <p>In response to my letter there arrived at my hotel a very repentant clerk,
  who expressed his sorrow at the incident, but kept on repeating the phrase,
  "I assure you, sir, that it was bonâ fide."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by bonâ fide?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," he replied, "my mates in the shop told me that you had been
  knighted, and that when a man was knighted he changed his name, and that you
  had taken that one."</p>

  <p>I need not say that my annoyance vanished, and that I laughed as heartily
  as his pals were probably doing round the corner.</p>

  <p>A few of the problems which have come my way have been very similar to
  some which I had invented for the exhibition of the reasoning of Mr. Holmes.
  I might perhaps quote one in which that gentleman's method of thought was
  copied with complete success. The case was as follows: A gentleman had
  disappeared. He had drawn a bank balance of £40 which was known to be on him.
  It was feared that he had been murdered for the sake of the money. He had
  last been heard of stopping at a large hotel in London, having come from the
  country that day. In the evening he went to a music-hall performance, came
  out of it about ten o'clock, returned to his hotel, changed his evening
  clothes, which were found in his room next day, and disappeared utterly. No
  one saw him leave the hotel, but a man occupying a neighbouring room declared
  that he had heard him moving during the night. A week had elapsed at the time
  that I was consulted, but the police had discovered nothing. Where was the
  man?</p>

  <p>These were the whole of the facts as communicated to me by his relatives
  in the country. Endeavouring to see the matter through the eyes of Mr.
  Holmes, I answered by return mail that he was evidently either in Glasgow or
  in Edinburgh. It proved later that he had, as a fact, gone to Edinburgh,
  though in the week that had passed he had moved to another part of
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>There I should leave the matter, for, as Dr. Watson has often shown, a
  solution explained is a mystery spoiled. At this stage the reader can lay
  down the book and show how simple it all is by working out the problem for
  himself. He has all the data which were ever given to me. For the sake of
  those, however, who have no turn for such conundrums, I will try to indicate
  the links which make the chain. The one advantage which I possessed was that
  I was familiar with the routine of London hotels&mdash;though I fancy it
  differs little from that of hotels elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The first thing was to look at the facts and separate what was certain
  from what was conjecture. It was <i>all</i> certain except the statement of
  the person who heard the missing man in the night. How could he tell such a
  sound from any other sound in a large hotel? That point could be disregarded,
  if it traversed the general conclusions.</p>

  <p>The first clear deduction was that the man had meant to disappear. Why
  else should he draw all his money? He had got out of the hotel during the
  night. But there is a night porter in all hotels, and it is impossible to get
  out without his knowledge when the door is once shut. The door is shut after
  the theatre-goers return&mdash;say at twelve o'clock. Therefore, the man left
  the hotel before twelve o'clock. He had come from the music-hall at ten, had
  changed his clothes, and had departed with his bag. No one had seen him do
  so. The inference is that he had done it at the moment when the hall was full
  of the returning guests, which is from eleven to eleven-thirty. After that
  hour, even if the door were still open, there are few people coming and going
  so that he with his bag would certainly have been seen.</p>

  <p>Having got so far upon firm ground, we now ask ourselves why a man who
  desires to hide himself should go out at such an hour. If he intended to
  conceal himself in London he need never have gone to the hotel at all.
  Clearly then he was going to catch a train which would carry him away. But a
  man who is deposited by a train in any provincial station during the night is
  likely to be noticed, and he might be sure that when the alarm was raised and
  his description given, some guard or porter would remember him. Therefore,
  his destination would be some large town which he would reach as a terminus
  where all his fellow passengers would disembark and where he would lose
  himself in the crowd. When one turns up the time table and sees that the
  great Scotch expresses bound for Edinburgh and Glasgow start about midnight,
  the goal is reached. As for his dress-suit, the fact that he abandoned it
  proved that he intended to adopt a line of life where there were no social
  amenities. This deduction also proved to be correct.</p>

  <p>I quote such a case in order to show that the general lines of reasoning
  advocated by Holmes have a real practical application to life. In another
  case, where a girl had become engaged to a young foreigner who suddenly
  disappeared, I was able, by a similar process of deduction, to show her very
  clearly both whither he had gone and how unworthy he was of her
  affections.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, these semi-scientific methods are occasionally laboured
  and slow as compared with the results of the rough-and-ready, practical man.
  Lest I should seem to have been throwing bouquets either to myself or to Mr.
  Holmes, let me state that on the occasion of a burglary of the village inn,
  within a stone-throw of my house, the village constable, with no theories at
  all, had seized the culprit while I had got no further than that he was a
  left-handed man with nails in his boots.</p>

  <p>The unusual or dramatic effects which lead to the invocation of Mr. Holmes
  in fiction are, of course, great aids to him in reaching a conclusion. It is
  the case where there is nothing to get hold of which is the deadly one. I
  heard of such a one in America which would certainly have presented a
  formidable problem. A gentleman of blameless life starting off for a Sunday
  evening walk with his family, suddenly observed that he had forgotten
  something. He went back into the house, the door of which was still open, and
  he left his people waiting for him outside. He never reappeared, and from
  that day to this there has been no clue as to what befell him. This was
  certainly one of the strangest cases of which I have ever heard in real
  life.</p>

  <p>Another very singular case came within my own observation. It was sent to
  me by an eminent London publisher. This gentleman had in his employment a
  head of department whose name we shall take as Musgrave. He was a
  hard-working person, with no special feature in his character. Mr. Musgrave
  died, and several years after his death a letter was received addressed to
  him, in the care of his employers. It bore the postmark of a tourist resort
  in the west of Canada, and had the note "Conflfilms" upon the outside of the
  envelope, with the words "Report Sy" in one corner.</p>

  <p>The publishers naturally opened the envelope as they had no note of the
  dead man's relatives. Inside were two blank sheets of paper. The letter, I
  may add, was registered. The publisher, being unable to make anything of
  this, sent it on to me, and I submitted the blank sheets to every possible
  chemical and heat test, with no result whatever. Beyond the fact that the
  writing appeared to be that of a woman there is nothing to add to this
  account. The matter was, and remains, an insoluble mystery. How the
  correspondent could have something so secret to say to Mr. Musgrave and yet
  not be aware that this person had been dead for several years is very hard to
  understand&mdash;or why blank sheets should be so carefully registered
  through the mail. I may add that I did not trust the sheets to my own
  chemical tests, but had the best expert advice without getting any result.
  Considered as a case it was a failure&mdash;and a very tantalizing one.</p>

  <p>Mr. Sherlock Holmes has always been a fair mark for practical jokers, and
  I have had numerous bogus cases of various degrees of ingenuity, marked
  cards, mysterious warnings, cypher messages, and other curious
  communications. It is astonishing the amount of trouble which some people
  will take with no object save a mystification. Upon one occasion, as I was
  entering the hall to take part in an amateur billiard competition, I was
  handed by the attendant a small packet which had been left for me. Upon
  opening it I found a piece of ordinary green chalk such as is used in
  billiards. I was amused by the incident, and I put the chalk into my
  waistcoat pocket and used it during the game. Afterward, I continued to use
  it until one day, some months later, as I rubbed the tip of my cue the face
  of the chalk crumbled in, and I found it was hollow. From the recess thus
  exposed I drew out a small slip of paper with the words "From Arsene Lupin to
  Sherlock Holmes."</p>

  <p>Imagine the state of mind of the joker who took such trouble to accomplish
  such a result.</p>

  <p>One of the mysteries submitted to Mr. Holmes was rather upon the psychic
  plane and therefore beyond his powers. The facts as alleged are most
  remarkable, though I have no proof of their truth save that the lady wrote
  earnestly and gave both her name and address. The person, whom we will call
  Mrs. Seagrave, had been given a curious secondhand ring, snake-shaped, and
  dull gold. This she took from her finger at night. One night she slept with
  it on and had a fearsome dream in which she seemed to be pushing off some
  furious creature which fastened its teeth into her arm. On awakening, the
  pain in the arm continued, and next day the imprint of a double set of teeth
  appeared upon the arm, with one tooth of the lower jaw missing. The marks
  were in the shape of blue-black bruises which had not broken the skin.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," says my correspondent, "what made me think the ring had
  anything to do with the matter, but I took a dislike to the thing and did not
  wear it for some months, when, being on a visit, I took to wearing it again."
  To make a long story short, the same thing happened, and the lady settled the
  matter forever by dropping her ring into the hottest corner of the kitchen
  range. This curious story, which I believe to be genuine, may not be as
  supernatural as it seems. It is well known that in some subjects a strong
  mental impression does produce a physical effect. Thus a very vivid nightmare
  dream with the impression of a bite might conceivably produce the mark of a
  bite. Such cases are well attested in medical annals. The second incident
  would, of course, arise by unconscious suggestion from the first. None the
  less, it is a very interesting little problem, whether psychic or
  material.</p><br>

  <p>Buried treasures are naturally among the problems which have come to Mr.
  Holmes. One genuine case was accompanied by a diagram here reproduced. It
  refers to an Indiaman which was wrecked upon the South African coast in the
  year 1782. If I were a younger man, I should be seriously inclined to go
  personally and look into the matter.</p>

  <p>The ship contained a remarkable treasure, including, I believe, the old
  crown regalia of Delhi. It is surmised that they buried these near the coast,
  and that this chart is a note of the spot. Each Indiaman in those days had
  its own semaphore code, and it is conjectured that the three marks upon the
  left are signals from a three-armed semaphore. Some record of their meaning
  might perhaps even now be found in the old papers of the India Office. The
  circle upon the right gives the compass bearings. The larger semi-circle may
  be the curved edge of a reef or of a rock. The figures above are the
  indications how to reach the X which marks the treasure. Possibly they may
  give the bearings as 186 feet from the 4 upon the semi-circle. The scene of
  the wreck is a lonely part of the country, but I shall be surprised if sooner
  or later, some one does not seriously set to work to solve the
  mystery&mdash;indeed at the present moment (1923) there is a small company
  working to that end.</p>

  <p>I must now apologise for this digressive chapter and return to the orderly
  sequence of my career.</p>

  Waterloo&mdash;A Cruel Blow&mdash;American Lecturing in 1894&mdash;Major
  Pond&mdash;First Lecture&mdash;Anti-British Wave&mdash;A Prophecy.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE chief event of our Norwood life was the birth of my son
  Kingsley, who lived to play a man's part in the Great War, and who died
  shortly after its conclusion. My own life was so busy that I had little time
  for religious development, but my thoughts still ran much upon psychic
  matters, and it was at this time that I joined the Psychical Research
  Society, of which I am now one of the senior members. I had few psychic
  experiences myself, and my material philosophy, as expressed in the "Stark
  Munro Letters," which were written just at the end of the Norwood period, was
  so strong that it did not easily crumble. Yet as year by year I read the
  wonderful literature of psychic science and experience, I became more and
  more impressed by the strength of the Spiritualist position and by the levity
  and want of all dignity and accurate knowledge which characterized the
  attitude of its opponents. The religious side of the matter had not yet
  struck me, but I felt more and more that the case for the phenomena vouched
  for by such men as Sir William Crookes, Barrett, Russel Wallace, Victor Hugo
  and Zöllner was so strong that I could see no answer to their exact record of
  observations. "It is incredible but it is true," said Crookes, and the
  aphorism seemed to exactly express my dawning convictions. I had a weekly
  impulse from the psychic paper, "Light," which has, I maintain, during its
  long career and up to the present day, presented as much brain to the square
  inch as any journal published in these islands.</p>

  </div>

  <p>My pleasant recollection of those days from 1880 to 1893 lay in my first
  introduction, as a more or less rising author, to the literary life of
  London. It is extraordinary to remember that at that time there was a general
  jeremiad in the London press about the extinction of English literature, and
  the assumed fact that there were no rising authors to take the place of those
  who were gone. The real fact is that there was a most amazing crop, all
  coming up simultaneously, presenting perhaps no Dickens or Thackeray, but
  none the less so numerous and many sided and with so high an average of
  achievement that I think they would match for varied excellence any similar
  harvest in our literary history. It was during the years roughly from 1888 to
  1893 that Rudyard Kipling, James Stephen Phillips, Watson, Grant Allen,
  Wells, Barrie, Bernard Shaw, H. A. Jones, Pinero, Marie Corelli, Stanley
  Weyman, Anthony Hope, Hall Caine, and a whole list of others were winning
  their spurs. Many of these men I met in the full flush of their youth and
  their powers. Of some of them I will speak more fully later. As to the old
  school they were certainly somewhat of a declension, and the newcomers found
  no very serious opposition in gaining a hearing. Wilkie Collins, Trollope,
  George Eliot and Charles Reade had passed. I have always been a very great
  admirer of the last, who was really a great innovator as well as a most
  dramatic writer, for it was he who first introduced realism and founded his
  stories upon carefully arranged documents. He was the literary father of
  Zola. George Eliot has never appealed to me much, for I like my effects in a
  less leisurely fashion; but Trollope also I consider to be a very original
  writer, though I fancy he traces his ancestry through Jane Austen. No writer
  is ever absolutely original. He always joins at some point on to that old
  tree of which he is a branch.</p>

  <p>Of the literary men whom I met at that time my most vivid recollections
  are of the group who centred round the new magazine, "The Idler," which had
  been started by Jerome K. Jerome, who had deservedly shot into fame with his
  splendidly humorous "Three Men in a Boat." It has all the exuberance and joy
  of life which youth brings with it, and even now if I have ever time to be at
  all sad, which is seldom enough, I can laugh away the shadows when I open
  that book. Jerome is a man who, like most humorists, has a very serious side
  to his character, as all who have seen "The Third Floor Back" will
  acknowledge, but he was inclined to be hotheaded and intolerant in political
  matters, from pure earnestness of purpose, which alienated some of his
  friends. He was associated in the editorship of "The Idler" with Robert Barr,
  a volcanic Anglo-or rather Scot-American, with a violent manner, a wealth of
  strong adjectives, and one of the kindest of natures underneath it all. He
  was one of the best raconteurs I have ever known, and as a writer I have
  always felt that he did not quite come into his own. George Burgin, like some
  quaint gentle character from Dickens, was the sub-editor, and Barrie,
  Zangwill, and many other rising men were among the contributors who met
  periodically at dinner. I was not unfaithful to "The Strand," but there were
  some contributions which they did not need, and with these I established my
  connection with "The Idler." It was at this time and in this way that I met
  James Barrie, of whom I shall have more to say when I come to that chapter
  which treats of some eminent and interesting men whom I have known.</p>

  <p>Two isolated facts stand out in my memory during that time at Norwood. One
  was that there seemed to be an imminent danger of war with France and that I
  applied for the Mediterranean war-correspondentship of the "Central News,"
  guessing that the chief centre of activity and interest would be in that
  quarter. I got the appointment and was all ready to start, but fortunately
  the crisis passed. The second was my first venture in the drama. I had
  written a short story called "A Straggler of '15," which had seemed to me to
  be a moving picture of an old soldier and his ways. My own eyes were moist as
  I wrote it and that is the surest way to moisten those of others. I now
  turned this into a one-act play, and, greatly daring, I sent it to Henry
  Irving, of whose genius I had been a fervent admirer ever since those
  Edinburgh days when I had paid my sixpence for the gallery night after night
  to see him in "Hamlet" and "The Lyons Mail." To my great delight I had a
  pleasing note from Bram Stoker, the great man's secretary, offering me £100
  for the copyright. It was a good bargain for him, for it is not too much to
  say that Corporal Gregory Brewster became one of his stock parts and it had
  the enormous advantage that the older he got the more naturally he played it.
  The house laughed and sobbed, exactly as I had done when I wrote it. Several
  critics went out of their way to explain that the merit lay entirely with the
  great actor and had nothing to do with the indifferent play, but as a matter
  of fact the last time I saw it acted it was by a real corporal from a
  military camp, in the humble setting of a village hall and it had exactly the
  same effect upon the audience which Irving produced at the Lyceum. So perhaps
  there was something in the writing after all, and certainly every stage
  effect was indicated in the manuscript. I would add that with his
  characteristic largeness in money matters Irving always sent me a guinea for
  each performance in spite of his purchase of the copyright. Henry Irving the
  son carried on the part and played it, in my opinion, better than the father.
  I can well remember the flush of pleasure on his face when I uttered the word
  "better" and how he seized my hand. I have no doubt it was trying for his
  great powers to be continually belittled by their measurement with those of
  his giant father, to whom he bore so remarkable a physical resemblance. His
  premature death was a great loss to the stage, as was that of his brother
  Lawrence, drowned with his wife in the great Canadian river of the same name
  as himself.</p>

  <p>I now come to the great misfortune which darkened and deflected our lives.
  I have said that my wife and I had taken a tour in Switzerland. I do not know
  whether she had overtaxed herself in this excursion, or whether we
  encountered microbes in some inn bedroom, but the fact remains that within a
  few weeks of our return she complained of pain in her side and cough. I had
  no suspicion of anything serious, but sent for the nearest good physician. To
  my surprise and alarm he told me when he descended from the bedroom that the
  lungs were very gravely affected, that there was every sign of rapid
  consumption and that he thought the case a most serious one with little hope,
  considering her record and family history, of a permanent cure. With two
  children, aged four and one, and a wife who was in such deadly danger, the
  situation was a difficult one. I confirmed the diagnosis by having Sir
  Douglas Powell down to see her, and I then set all my energy to work to save
  the situation. The home was abandoned, the newly bought furniture was sold,
  and we made for Davos in the High Alps where there seemed the best chance of
  killing this accursed microbe which was rapidly eating out her vitals.</p>

  <p>And we succeeded. When I think that the attack was one of what is called
  "galloping consumption," and that the doctors did not give more than a few
  months, and yet that we postponed the fatal issue from 1893 to 1906, I think
  it is proof that the successive measures were wise. The invalid's life was
  happy too, for it was necessarily spent in glorious scenery. It was seldom
  marred by pain, and it was sustained by that optimism which is peculiar to
  the disease, and which came naturally to her quietly contented nature.</p>

  <p>As there were no particular social distractions at Davos, and as our life
  was bounded by the snow and fir which girt us in, I was able to devote myself
  to doing a good deal of work and also to taking up with some energy the
  winter sports for which the place is famous. Whilst there I began the
  Brigadier Gerard series of stories, founded largely upon that great book,
  "The Memoirs of General Marbot." This entailed a great deal of research into
  Napoleonic days, and my military detail was, I think, very accurate&mdash;so
  much so that I had a warm letter of appreciation from Archibald Forbes, the
  famous war correspondent, who was himself a great Napoleonic and military
  student. Before the end of the winter we were assured that the ravages of the
  disease had been checked. I dared not return to England, however, for fear of
  a relapse, so with the summer we moved on to Maloja, another health resort at
  the end of the Engadine valley, and there we endeavoured to hold all we had
  won&mdash;which, with occasional relapses, we succeeded in doing.</p>

  <p>My sister Lottie, free at last from the work which she had so bravely
  done, had now joined us. Connie, the younger sister, had come back from
  Portugal earlier, and had joined us at Norwood, where she had met and
  eventually married E. W. Hornung the novelist. Of Hornung I will speak later.
  In the meantime Lottie's presence and the improvement of the invalid, which
  was so marked that no sudden crisis was thought at all possible, gave me
  renewed liberty of action. Before the catastrophe occurred I had given some
  lectures on literature at home, and the work with its movement and bustle was
  not distasteful to me. Now I was strongly pressed to go to America on the
  same errand, and in the late autumn of 1894 I set out on this new
  adventure.</p>

  <p>My brother Innes, he who had shared my first days in Southsea, had since
  passed through Richmond Public School, and afterwards the Woolwich Academy,
  so that he was now just emerging as a subaltern. As I needed some companion,
  and as I thought that the change would do him good, I asked him to come with
  me to the States. We crossed on the ill-fated German liner <i>Elbe</i>, which
  a very short time afterwards was sunk after collision with a collier in the
  North Sea. Already I observed evidence of that irrational hatred of the
  British which in the course of twenty years was to lead to so terrific a
  result involving the destruction of the German Empire. I remember that on
  some fête day on board, the saloon was thickly decorated with German and
  American flags without one single British one, though a fair proportion of
  the passengers were British. Innes and I then and there drew a Union Jack and
  stuck it up aloft, where its isolation drew attention to our grievance.</p>

  <p>Major Pond was my impresario in America, and a quaint character he was. He
  seemed the very personification of his country, huge, loose limbed,
  straggling, with a goat's beard and a nasal voice. He had fought in the Civil
  War and been mixed up with every historical American event of his
  lifetime.</p>

  <p>He was a good, kind fellow and we formed a friendship which was never
  broken. He met us in the docks, and carried us off to a little hotel beside
  the Aldine Club, a small literary club, in which we had our meals.</p>

  <p>I have treated America and my impression of that amazing and perplexing
  country in later pages of these memoirs, when I visited it under more
  detached conditions. At present it was all hard work with little time for
  general observations. Pond had fixed me up a pretty hard schedule, but on the
  other hand I had bargained to get back to Davos in time to spend Christmas
  with my wife, so that there was a limit to my servitude. My first reading was
  given in a fashionable Baptist Church, which was the usual launching slip for
  Pond's new lecturers. We had walked from the retiring-room and were just
  coming in sight of the audience when I felt something tickle my ear. I put up
  my hand and found that my collar was undone, my tie had fallen off, and my
  stud, the first cause of all the trouble, had disappeared. Standing there, on
  the edge of the platform, Pond dragged out his own stud. I replaced
  everything, and sailed on quite as I should be, while Pond retired to refit.
  It is strange, and possibly more than coincidence, how often one is prevented
  at the last moment from making some foolish appearance in public.</p>

  <p>The readings went very well and the audience was generous in applause. I
  have my own theory of reading, which is that it should be entirely
  disassociated from acting and should be made as natural and also as audible
  as possible. Such a presentment is, I am sure, the less tiring for an
  audience. Indeed I read to them exactly as in my boyhood I used to read to my
  mother. I gave extracts from recent British authors, including some work of
  my own, and as I mixed up the grave and the gay I was able to keep them
  mildly entertained for an hour. Some papers maintained that I could not read
  at all, but I think that what they really meant was that I did not act at
  all. Others seemed to endorse my method. Anyhow I had an excellent first
  reception and Pond told me that he lay smiling all night after it. He had no
  difficulty afterwards in booking as many engagements as he could fit into the
  time. I visited every town of any size between Boston in the north and
  Washington in the south, while Chicago and Milwaukee marked my western
  limit.</p>

  <p>Sometimes I found that it took me all my time to fit in the engagements,
  however fast I might travel. Once, for example, I lectured at Daly's Theatre
  in New York at a matinée, at Princetown College the same evening, some 100
  miles away, and at Philadelphia next afternoon. It was no wonder that I got
  very tired&mdash;the more so as the exuberant hospitality in those
  pre-prohibition days was enough in itself to take the energies out of the
  visitor. It was all done in kindness, but it was dangerous for a man who had
  his work to do. I had one little break when I paid a pleasant visit to
  Rudyard Kipling, of which I shall speak later. Bar those few days I was going
  hard all the time, and it is no wonder that I was so tired out that I kept to
  my bunk most of the way from New York to Liverpool.</p>

  <p>My memories are the confused ones of a weary man. I recall one amusing
  incident when as I bustled on to the stage at Daly's Theatre I tripped over
  the wooden sill of the stage door, with the result that I came cantering down
  the sloping stage towards the audience, shedding books and papers on my way.
  There was much laughter and a general desire for an encore.</p>

  <p>Our visit was marred by one of those waves of anti-British feeling which
  sweep occasionally over the States, and which emanate from their own early
  history, every grievance being exaggerated and inflamed by the constant
  hostility of Irish pressmen and politicians. It all seems very absurd and
  contemptible to the travelling Briton, because he is aware how entirely
  one-sided it is, and how welcome, for example, is the American flag in every
  British public display. This was not known by the home-staying American, and
  probably he imagined that his own country was treated as rudely by us as ours
  by his. The Dunraven yacht race had given additional acerbity to this chronic
  ill-feeling, and it was very active at the time of our visit. I remember that
  a banquet was given to us at a club at Detroit at which the wine flowed
  freely, and which ended by a speech by one of our hosts in which he bitterly
  attacked the British Empire. My brother and I, with one or two Canadians who
  were present, were naturally much affronted, but we made every allowance for
  the lateness of the evening. I asked leave, however, to reply to the speech,
  and some of those who were present have assured me that they have never
  forgotten what I said. In the course of my remarks I said: "You Americans
  have lived up to now within your own palings, and know nothing of the real
  world outside. But now your land is filled up, and you will be compelled to
  mix more with the other nations. When you do so you will find that there is
  only one which can at all understand your ways and your aspirations, or will
  have the least sympathy. That is the mother country which you are now so fond
  of insulting. She is an Empire, and you will soon be an Empire also, and only
  then will you understand each other, and you will realize that you have only
  one real friend in the world." It was only two or three years later that
  there came the Cuban war, the episode of Manilla Bay where the British
  Commander joined up with the Americans against the Germans, and several other
  incidents which proved the truth of my remarks.</p>

  <p>A writer of average income is bound to lose pecuniarily upon a lecture
  tour, even in America, unless he prolongs it very much and works very hard
  indeed.</p>

  <p>By losing I do not mean that he is actually out of pocket, but that he
  could have earned far more if he had never gone outside his own study. In my
  own case I found after our joint expenses were paid that there was about
  £1,000 over. The disposal of this money furnished a curious example of the
  power of prayer, which, as Mr. S. S. McClure has already narrated it, I have
  no delicacy in telling. He tells how he was endeavouring to run his magazine,
  how he was down to his last farthing, how he dropped on his knees on the
  office floor to pray for help, and how on the same day an Englishman who was
  a mere acquaintance walked into the office, and said: "McClure, I believe in
  you and in the future of your magazine," and put down £1,000 on the table. A
  critic might perhaps observe that under such circumstances to sell 1,000
  shares at face value was rather hard upon the ignorant and trusting buyer.
  For a long time I could clearly see the workings of Providence as directed
  towards Sam McClure, but could not quite get their perspective as regards
  myself, but I am bound to admit that in the long run, after many
  vicissitudes, the deal was justified both ways, and I was finally able to
  sell my holding twenty years later at a reasonable advance. The immediate
  result, however, was that I returned to Davos with all my American earnings
  locked up, and with no actual visible result of my venture.</p>

  <p>The Davos season was in full blast when I returned, and my wife was
  holding her own well. It was at this time, in the early months of 1895, that
  I developed ski-running in Switzerland as described in my chapter on Sport.
  We lingered late at Davos, so late that I was able to lay out a golf course,
  which was hampered in its start by the curious trick the cows had of chewing
  up the red flags. From Davos we finally moved to Caux, over the lake of
  Geneva, where for some months I worked steadily at my writing. With the
  autumn I visited England, leaving the ladies at Caux, and it was then that
  events occurred which turned our road of life to a new angle.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-13"
     id="ch-13"></a>XIII &mdash; EGYPT IN 1896</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">Life in Egypt&mdash;Accident&mdash;The Men who made
  Egypt&mdash;Up the Nile&mdash;The Salt Lakes&mdash;Adventure in the
  Desert&mdash;The Coptic Monastery&mdash;Colonel Lewis&mdash;A
  Surprise.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE wretched microbe which had so completely disorganized
  our lives, and which had produced all the sufferings so patiently borne, now
  seemed to be latent, and it was hoped that if we spent a winter in Egypt the
  cure might be complete. During this short visit to England, whither I had to
  rush every now and again in order to adjust my affairs, I met Grant Allen at
  luncheon, and he told me that he had also suffered from consumption and that
  he had found his salvation in the soil and air of Hindhead in Surrey. It was
  quite a new idea to me that we might actually live with impunity in England
  once more, and it was a pleasant thought after resigning oneself to a life
  which was unnatural to both of us at foreign health resorts. I acted very
  promptly, for I rushed down to Hindhead, bought an admirable plot of ground,
  put the architectural work into the hands of my old friend and fellow psychic
  researcher Mr. Ball of Southsea, and saw the builder chosen and everything in
  train before leaving England in the autumn of 1895. If Egypt was a success,
  we should have a roof of our own to which to return. The thought of it
  brought renewed hope to the sufferer.</p>

  <p>I then set forth, picked up my wife and my sister Lottie at Caux and took
  them on by easy stages through Italy, stopping a few days at Rome, and so to
  Brindisi, where we picked up a boat for Egypt. Once at Cairo we took up our
  quarters at the Mena Hotel, in the very shadow of the Pyramids, and there we
  settled down for the winter. I was still doing the Brigadier Gerard stories
  at the time, which required a good deal of historical research, but I had
  brought my materials with me, and all I lacked was the energy, which I found
  it most difficult to find in that enervating land. On the whole it was a
  pleasant winter and led up to a most unforeseen climax. I ascended the Great
  Pyramid once, and was certainly never tempted to do so again, and was content
  to watch the struggles of the endless drove of tourists who attempted that
  uncomfortable and useless feat. There was golf of sorts and there was riding.
  I was still an immature horseman, but I felt that only practice would help
  me, so I set forth upon weird steeds provided by the livery stables opposite.
  As a rule they erred on the side of dulness, but I have a very vivid
  recollection of one which restored the average. If my right eyelid drops
  somewhat over my eye it is not the result of philosophic brooding, but it is
  the doing of a black devil of a horse with a var-minty head, slab-sided ribs
  and restless ears. I disliked the look of the beast, and the moment I threw
  my leg over him he dashed off as if it were a race. Away we went across the
  desert, I with one foot in the stirrup, holding on as best I might. It is
  possible I could have kept on until he was weary, but he came suddenly on
  cultivated land and his forelegs sank in a moment over his fetlocks. The
  sudden stop threw me over his head, but I held on to the bridle, and he,
  pawing about with his front hoofs, struck me over the eye, and made a deep
  star-shaped wound which covered me with blood. I led him back and a pretty
  sight I presented as I appeared before the crowded verandah! Five stitches
  were needed, but I was thankful, for very easily I might have lost my
  sight.</p>

  <p>My wife was well enough now to join in society, while my sister was just
  at an age to enjoy it, so that we saw a little of the very jovial life of
  Cairo, though the fact that Mena is some 7 miles out, on the most monotonous
  road in the world, saved us from any excess. It was always a task to get in
  and out, so that only a great temptation would draw us. I joined in male
  society, however, a good deal and learned to know many of those great men who
  were shaping the new destinies of Egypt. I sketched some of them at the time
  in two paragraphs which may be quoted.</p>

  <p>"There is a broad and comfortable sofa in the hall of the Turf Club, and
  if you sit there about luncheon time you will see a fair sprinkling of
  Anglo-Egyptians, men who have helped to make, and are still helping to make,
  the history of our times. You have a view of the street from where you are,
  and perhaps in the brilliant sunshine a carriage flies past with two running
  syces before it and an English coachman upon the box. Within, one catches a
  glimpse of a strong florid face with a close-cropped soldierly grey
  moustache, the expression good-humoured and inscrutable. This is Lord Cromer,
  whom Egypt has changed from a major of gunners to a peer of the realm, while
  he in turn has changed it from a province of the East to one of the West. One
  has but to look at him to read the secret of his success as a diplomatist.
  His clear head, his brave heart, his physical health, and his nerves of iron
  are all impressed upon you even in that momentary glance at his carriage. And
  that lounging ennuyé attitude is characteristic also&mdash;most
  characteristic at this moment, when few men in the world can have more
  pressing responsibility upon their shoulders. It is what one could expect
  from the man who at the most critical moment of recent Egyptian history is
  commonly reported to have brought diplomatic interviews to an abrupt
  conclusion with the explanation that the time had come for his daily
  lawn-tennis engagement. It is no wonder that so strong a representative
  should win the confidence of his own countrymen, but he has made as deep an
  impression upon the native mind, which finds it difficult under this veiled
  Protectorate of ours to estimate the comparative strength of individuals.
  'Suppose Khedive tell Lord Cromer go, Lord Cromer go?' asked my donkey-boy,
  and so put his chocolate finger upon the central point of the whole
  situation.</p>

  <p>"But this is a digression from the Turf Club, where you are seated upon a
  settee in the hall and watching the Englishmen who have done so much to
  regenerate Egypt. Of all the singular experiences of this most venerable
  land, surely this rebuilding at the hands of a little group of bustling,
  clear-headed Anglo-Saxons is the most extraordinary. There are Garstin and
  Wilcocks, the great water captains who have coaxed the Nile to right and to
  left, until the time seems to be coming when none of its waters will ever
  reach the Mediterranean at all. There is Kitchener, tall and straight, a grim
  silent soldier, with a weal of a Dervish bullet upon his face. There you may
  see Rogers, who stamped out the cholera, Scott, who reformed the law, Palmer,
  who relieved the over-taxed fellaheen, Hooker, who exterminated the locusts,
  Wingate, who knows more than any European of the currents of feeling in the
  Soudan the same Wingate who reached his arm out a thousand miles and plucked
  Slatin out of Khartoum. And beside him the small man with the yellow-brown
  moustache and the cheery, ruddy face is Slatin himself, whose one wish in the
  world now is to have the Khalifa at his sword-point&mdash;that Khalifa at
  whose heels he had to run for so many weary years."</p>

  <p>Shortly after the opening of the New Year of 1896 we went in one of Cook's
  boats up the river, getting as far as the outposts of civilization at Wady
  Haifa. The banks in the upper reaches were not too safe, as raiders on camels
  came down at times, but on the water one was secure from all the chances of
  Fate. At the same time I thought that the managers of these tours took undue
  risks, and when I found myself on one occasion on the rock of Abousir with a
  drove of helpless tourists, male and female, nothing whatever between us and
  the tribesmen, and a river between us and the nearest troops, I could not but
  think what an appalling situation would arise if a little troop of these
  far-riding camel men were to appear. We had four negro soldiers as an escort,
  who would be helpless before any normal raiding party. It was the strong
  impression which I there received which gave me the idea of taking a group of
  people of different types and working out what the effect of so horrible an
  experience would be upon each. This became "The Tragedy of the Korosko,"
  published in America as "A Desert Drama" and afterwards dramatized with
  variations as "The Fires of Fate." All went well as a matter of fact, but I
  thought then, and experienced British officers agreed with me, that it was
  unjustifiable. As the whole frontier force was longing for an excuse to
  advance, I am not sure that they would not have welcomed it if the Dervishes
  had risen to the ground bait which every week in the same place was laid in
  front of them.</p>

  <p>I do not know how many temples we explored during that tour, but they
  seemed to me endless, some dating back to the mists of antiquity and some as
  recent as Cleopatra and the Roman period. The majestic continuity of Egyptian
  History seems to be its most remarkable feature. You examine the tombs of the
  First Dynasty at Abydos and there you see carved deep in the stone the sacred
  hawk, the goose, the plover, the signs of Horus and Osiris, of Upper and
  Lower Egypt. These were carved long before the Pyramids were built and can
  hardly be less ancient than 4000 B.C. Then you inspect a temple built by the
  Ptolemies, after the date of Alexander the Great, and there you see the same
  old symbols cut in the same old way. There is nothing like this in the world.
  The Roman and the British Empires are mushrooms in comparison. Judged by
  Egyptian standards the days of Alfred the Great would be next door to our
  own, and our customs, symbols and way of thinking the same. The race seems to
  have petrified, and how they could do so without being destroyed by some more
  virile nation is hard to understand.</p>

  <p>Their arts seem to have been high but their reasoning power in many ways
  contemptible. The recent discovery of the King's tomb near Thebes&mdash;I
  write in 1924&mdash;shows how wonderful were their decorations and the
  amenities of their lives. But consider the tomb itself. What a degraded
  intelligence does it not show! The idea that the body, the old outworn
  greatcoat which was once wrapped round the soul, should at any cost be
  preserved is the last word in materialism. And the hundred baskets of
  provisions to feed the soul upon its journey! I can never believe that a
  people with such ideas could be other than emasculated in their
  minds&mdash;the fate of every nation which comes under the rule of a
  priesthood.</p>

  <p>It had been suggested that I should go out to the Salt Lakes in the Desert
  some 50 miles from Cairo, and see the old Coptic Monastery there. Those
  ancient monasteries, the abode alternately of saints and perverts&mdash;we
  saw specimens of each&mdash;have always aroused my keen interest, dating as
  they do to very early days of Christianity. Indeed, their date is often
  unknown, but everything betokens great age and the spirit which founded them
  seems to have been that of the hermits who in the third and fourth centuries
  swarmed in these wildernesses.</p>

  <p>Leaving my wife at Mena, I went with Colonel Lewis of the Egyptian army,
  an excellent companion and guide. On arriving at a wayside station, we found
  a most amazing vehicle awaiting us, a sort of circus coach, all gilding and
  frippery. It proved to be the coach of State which had been prepared for
  Napoleon III on the chance that he would come to open the Suez Canal. It was
  surely a good bit of work, for here it was still strong and fit, but absurdly
  out of place in the majestic simplicity of the Libyan Desert.</p>

  <p>Into this we got and set forth, the only guide being wheel-marks across
  the sand which in some of the harder places were almost invisible. The great
  sand waste rolled in yellow billows all around us, and far behind us the line
  of green trees marked the course of the Nile. Once a black dot appeared
  which, as it grew nearer, proved to be some sort of Oriental on foot. As he
  came up to us he opened a blackened mouth, pointed to it, and cried, "Moya!
  Moya!" which means water. We had none and could only point encouragingly to
  the green belt behind us, on which with a curse he staggered upon his
  way.</p>

  <p>A surprising adventure befell us, for the heavens suddenly clouded over
  and rain began to fall, an almost unknown thing in those parts. We lumbered
  on, however, with our two horses, while Colonel Lewis, who was keen on
  getting fit, ran behind. I remember saying to him that in my wildest dreams I
  never thought that I should drive across the Libyan Desert in an Emperor's
  coach with a full colonel as carriage dog. Presently in the fading light the
  horses slowed down, the Nubian driver descended, and began alternately
  scanning the ground and making gestures of despair. We realized then that he
  had lost the tracks and therefore that we had no notion where we were, though
  we had strong reasons to believe that we were to the south of the route. The
  difficulty was to know which was north and which south. It was an awkward
  business since we had no food or water and could see no end to our troubles.
  The further we moved the deeper we should be involved. Night had closed in,
  and I was looking up at the drifting scud above us when in the chink of two
  clouds I saw for an instant a cluster of stars, and made sure that they were
  the four wheels of Charles's Wain. I am no astronomer, but I reasoned that
  this constellation would lie to the north of us, and so it proved, for when
  we headed that way, examining the ground every hundred yards or so with
  matches, we came across the track once more.</p>

  <p>Our adventures, however, were not over, and it was all like a queer dream.
  We had great difficulty in keeping the track in the darkness, and the absurd
  coach lumbered and creaked while we walked with lanterns ahead of it.
  Suddenly to our joy we saw a bright light in the gloom. We quickened our
  pace, and came presently to a tent with a florid-bearded man seated outside
  it beside a little table where he was drawing by the light of a lamp. The
  rain had cleared now, but the sky was still overcast. In answer to our hail
  this man rather gruffly told us that he was a German surveyor at work in the
  desert. He motioned with his hand when we told him whither we were bound, and
  said it was close by. After leaving him we wandered on, and losing the tracks
  we were again very badly bushed. It seemed an hour or two before to our joy
  we saw a light ahead and prepared for a night's rest at the halfway house,
  which was our immediate destination. But when we reached the light what we
  saw was a florid bearded man sitting outside a small tent with a lamp upon a
  table. We had moved in a circle. Fresh explanations&mdash;and this time we
  really did keep to the track and reached a big deserted wooden hut, where we
  put up the horses, ate some cold food, and tumbled, very tired, into two of
  the bunks which lined it.</p>

  <p>The morrow made amends for all. It broke cold and clear and I have seldom
  felt a greater sense of exhilaration than when I awoke and walking out before
  dressing saw the whole endless desert stretching away on every side of me,
  yellow sand and black rock, to the blue shimmering horizon. We harnessed up
  and within a few hours came on the Natron Lake, a great salt lake, with a few
  scattered houses at one end where the workers dry out and prepare the salt. A
  couple of miles off was the lonely monastery which we had come to
  see&mdash;less lonely now, but before the salt works were established one of
  the most inaccessible places one could imagine. It consisted of a huge outer
  wall, which seemed to be made of hardened clay. It had no doors or windows
  save one little opening which could be easily defended against the prowling
  Arabs, but I fear the garrison would not be very stout-hearted, for it was
  said to be the fear of military service which caused many of the monks to
  discover that they had a vocation. On being admitted I was conscious that we
  were not too welcome, though the military title of my companion commanded
  respect. We were shown round the inner courtyard, where there were palm trees
  and a garden, and then round the scattered houses within the wall. Near the
  latter there was, I remember, a barrel full of some substance which seemed to
  me, both by look and feel, to be rounded pieces of some light stone, and I
  asked if it were to hurl down at the Arabs if they attacked the door. It
  proved to be the store of bread for the Monastery. We were treated to wine,
  which was sweet tent wine, which is still used, I believe, in the Holy
  Communion, showing how straight our customs come from the East. The Abbot
  seemed to me to be a decent man, but he complained of illness and was
  gratified when I overhauled him thoroughly, percussed his chest, and promised
  to send him out some medicine from Cairo. I did so, but whether it ever
  reached my remote patient I never learned. Some of the brothers, however,
  looked debauched, and there was a general air of nothing-to-do, which may
  have been deceptive but which certainly impressed me that day. As I looked
  from the walls and saw the desert on all sides, unbroken save for one blue
  corner of the salt lake, it was strange to consider that this was all which
  these men would ever sec of the world, and to contrast their fate with my own
  busy and varied existence. There was a library, but the books were scattered
  on the floor, all of them old and some no doubt rare. Since the discovery of
  the "Codex Sinaiticus" I presume that all these old Coptic libraries have
  been examined by scholars, but it certainly seemed to me that there might be
  some valuable stuff in that untidy heap.</p>

  <p>Next evening Colonel Lewis and I were back in Cairo. We heard no news upon
  the way, and we had reached the Turf Club and were in the cloak room washing
  our hands before dinner when some man came in and said:</p>

  <p>"Why, Lewis, how is it you are not with your brigade?"</p>

  <p>"My brigade!"</p>

  <p>"Have you been away?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, at the Natron Lakes."</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens! Have you heard nothing?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Why, man, war is declared. We are advancing on Dongola. The whole army is
  concentrating on the frontier, and you are in command of an advanced
  brigade."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" Lewis's soap splashed into the water, and I wonder he did not
  fall plump on the floor. Thus it was that we learned of the next adventure
  which was opening up before both us and the British Empire.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-14"
     id="ch-14"></a>XIV &mdash; ON THE EDGE OF A STORM</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">The Storm Centre&mdash;To the
  Frontier&mdash;Assouan&mdash;Excited Officers&mdash;With the Press
  Men&mdash;A Long Camel Ride&mdash;Night Marches&mdash;Halfa&mdash;Gwynne of
  the "Morning Post"&mdash;Anley&mdash;A Sudden Voyage&mdash;Apricots and
  Rousseau.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT is impossible to be near great historical events and not
  to desire to take part in them, or at the least to observe them. Egypt had
  suddenly become the storm centre of the world, and chance had placed me there
  at that moment. Clearly I could not remain in Cairo, but must get up by hook
  or by crook to the frontier. It was March and the weather would soon be too
  warm for my wife, but she was good enough to say that she would wait with my
  sister until April if I would promise to return by then. At that time the
  general idea was that some great event would at once occur, though looking
  back one can see that that was hardly possible. Anyhow I had a great urge to
  go South.</p>

  <p>There was only one way to do it. The big morning papers had their men
  already upon the spot. But it was less likely that the evening papers were
  provided. I cabled to the "Westminster Gazette" asking to be made their
  honorary correspondent <i>pro tem</i>. I had a cable back assenting. Armed
  with this I approached the proper authority, and so within a day or two I was
  duly appointed and everything was in order.</p>

  <p>I had to make my own way up and I had to get together some sort of kit.
  The latter was done hurriedly and was of fearsome quality. I bought a huge
  revolver of Italian make with a hundred cartridges, an ugly unreliable
  weapon. I bought also a water bottle, which was made of new resinous wood and
  gave a most horrible flavour of turpentine to everything put into it. It was
  like drinking varnish, but before I got back there were times when I was
  ready to drink varnish or anything else that was damp.</p>

  <p>With a light khaki coat, riding breeches, a small valise, and the usual
  Christmas tree hung round me, I started off from Cairo by train to Assiout,
  where a small river boat was waiting. It was filled with officers going to
  the front, and we had a pleasant few days journeying to Assouan together.
  There were, I remember, several junior officers who have since made names in
  the world, Maxwell (now General Sir John Maxwell) and Hickman, who also rose
  to the top. There was a young cavalry lieutenant also, one Smythe, who seemed
  to me to be too gentle and quiet for such rough work as lay ahead. The next
  time I heard of him was when he was gazetted for the Victoria Cross. In
  soldiering there is nothing more deceptive than appearances. Your fierce,
  truculent man may always have a yellow streak where the gentle student has a
  core of steel. There lay one of the many mistakes which the Germans made
  later in judging those "unwarlike islanders" the British.</p>

  <p>The great question at the opening of the campaign was whether the native
  fellah troops would stand. The five negro battalions were as good as could
  be, but the record of the eight or nine Egyptian ones was not reassuring. The
  Arab of the Soudan is a desperate fanatic who rushes to death with the frenzy
  of a madman, and longs for close quarters where he can bury his spear in the
  body of his foeman, even though he carries several bullets in him before he
  reaches him. Would the Egyptians stand such onslaughts as these? It was
  thought improbable that they would, and so British battalions, the
  Connaughts, the Staffords and others, were brought up to stiffen their battle
  line. One great advantage the native soldiers had&mdash;and without it their
  case would have been hopeless&mdash;and that was that their officers were
  among the picked men of the British Army. Kitchener would have none but the
  unmarried, for it was to be a wholehearted and if need be a desperate
  service, and, as the pay and life were good, he could accept or reject as lie
  chose, so that his leaders were splendid. It was curious to see their fair
  faces and flaxen moustaches under the red tarbooshes, as they marched at the
  side of their men.</p>

  <p>The relations between these officers and their men were paternal. If an
  officer of black troops came to Cairo he would go back with a pillow case
  stuffed with candies for his men. The Egyptians were more inscrutable, less
  sporting and less lovable, but none the less their officers were very loyal
  to them, and bitterly resented the distrust shown by the rest of the army.
  One British officer at some early battle seized the enemy's flag and cried:
  "Well, the English shall not have this anyhow." It is this spirit, whether in
  Egypt or in India, which makes the British officer an ideal leader of native
  troops. Even at the great Indian Mutiny they would not hear a word against
  their men until they were murdered by them.</p>

  <p>At Assouan we were held up for a week, and no one was allowed to go
  further. We were already well within the radius of the Arab raiders, for in
  the last year they had struck even further north. The desert is like the sea,
  for if you have the camels, which correspond to the ships, your blow may fall
  anywhere and your attack is not suspected until the moment that you appear.
  The crowd of British officers who were waiting seemed little worried by any
  such possibility and were as unconcerned as if it was a Cook's tour and not a
  particularly dangerous expedition&mdash;so dangerous that of the last army
  which went South, that of Hicks Pasha, hardly one single man was ever seen
  again. Only once did I see them really excited. I had returned to the hotel
  which was the general head-quarters, and as I entered the hall I saw a crowd
  of them all clustering round the notice board to read a telegram which had
  just been suspended. They were on the toes of their spurred boots, with their
  necks outstretched and every sign of quivering and eager interest. "Ah,"
  thought I, "at last we have got through the hide of these impenetrable men. I
  suppose the Khalifa is coming down, horse, foot, and artillery, and that we
  are on the eve of battle." I pushed my way in, and thrust my head among all
  the bobbing sun-helmets. It was the account of the Oxford and Cambridge
  Boat-race.</p>

  <p>I was struck by the splendid zeal of every one. It was an inspiration.
  Hickman had been full of combative plans all the way on the boat. When we
  arrived there was a message for him to go down to Keneh and buy camels. Here
  was a drop down for a man all on fire for action. "It is quite right," said
  he, when I condoled with him. "The force must have camels. I am the man to
  buy them. We all work for one end." Self-abnegation of this sort is general.
  The British officer at his best is really a splendid fellow, a large edition
  of the public schoolboy, with his cheery slang overlying a serious purpose
  which he would usually die rather than admit. I heard of three of them at
  rail-end, all doing essential work and all with a degree of fever on them
  which might well have excused them from work altogether. Every evening each
  of them dropped a dollar into a hat, they then all took their temperatures
  and the highest got the pool.</p>

  <p>Assouan is at the foot of the Cataract, which extends for some 30 miles,
  and everything has to be transhipped and taken on a narrow toy railway to be
  reloaded on fresh steamers at Shellal. It was a huge task and I remember
  sympathizing with Captain Morgan, who with fatigue parties of Egyptians and
  chain gangs of convicts was pushing the stuff through. Morgan had sold me a
  horse once and was shy of me in consequence, but he soon saw that I bore no
  grudge. <i>Caveat emptor</i>! I already saw in him those qualities of
  organization which made him a real factor both in the Boer and in the
  European war. He has just died (1923) a general and full of honours. I
  remember seeing the 7th Egyptians after a long gruelling desert march working
  at those stores until they were so played out that it took four of them to
  raise a sixty-pound biscuit box.</p>

  <p>The big pressmen had now arrived&mdash;"Where the carcass is there shall
  the eagles, etc."&mdash;and I had luckily made friends with them, so it was
  determined that we should all go on together. There were five of us who
  started out, led by Knight of the "Falcon," representing "The Times," and
  looking not unlike a falcon himself. He was a great man, tall and muscular, a
  famous yachtsman and treasure-seeker, traveller, fighter and scholar. He had
  just left the French in Madagascar. Next came Scudamore of the "Daily News,"
  small, Celtic, mercurial, full of wit and go. He was a great purchaser of
  camels, which were of course all paid for by the paper, so that when
  Robinson, the editor of the "Daily News," heard of the Boer war his first
  comment was, "Well, thank God, there are no camels in South Africa." It was a
  study in Eastern ways to see Scudamore buying camels, and I learned from him
  how it is done. An Arab leads up the absurd-looking creature. You look
  deprecatingly at the beast&mdash;and you cannot take a better model than the
  creature's own expression as it looks at you. You ask how much is wanted for
  it. The owner says £16. You then give a shriek of derision, sweep your arm
  across as if to wave him and his camel out of your sight for ever, and
  turning with a whisk you set off rapidly in the other direction. How far you
  go depends upon the price asked. If it is really very high, you may not get
  back for your dinner. But as a rule a hundred yards or so meet the case, and
  you shape your course so as to reach the camel and its owner. You stop in
  front of them and look at them with a disinterested and surprised look to
  intimate that you wonder that they should still be loitering there. The Arab
  asks how much you will give. You answer £8. Then it is his turn to scream,
  whisk round, and do his hundred yards, his absurd chattel with its horn-pipey
  legs trotting along behind him. But he returns to say that he will take
  fourteen, and off you go again with a howl and a wave. So the bargaining goes
  on, the circles continually shortening, until you have settled upon the
  middle price.</p>

  <p>But it is only when you have bought your camel that the troubles begin. It
  is the strangest and most deceptive animal in the world. Its appearance is so
  staid and respectable that you cannot give it credit for the black villainy
  that lurks within. It approaches you with a mildly interested and superior
  expression, like a patrician lady in a Sunday school. You feel that a pair of
  glasses at the end of a fan is the one thing lacking. Then it puts its lips
  gently forward, with a far-away look in its eyes, and you have just time to
  say, "The pretty dear is going to kiss me," when two rows of frightful green
  teeth clash in front of you, and you give such a backward jump as you could
  never have hoped at your age to accomplish. When once the veil is dropped,
  anything more demoniacal than the face of a camel cannot be conceived. No
  kindness and no length of ownership seem to make them friendly. And yet you
  must make allowances for a creature which can carry 600 lb. for 20 miles a
  day, and ask for no water and little food at the end of it.</p>

  <p>This, however, is digression. The other pressmen were Beaman of the
  "Standard," fresh from Constantinople, and almost an Eastern in his ways, and
  Julian Corbett, representing the "Pall Mall," a gentle and amiable man who
  was destined later to be the naval historian of the Great War. Like myself he
  was an amateur among professionals, and had to return within a given date to
  Cairo.</p>

  <p>As it was clear that nothing important could take place instantly, we
  determined to do part of the journey by road. A force of cavalry was going
  up, and we were ordered to join them and use them as an escort, but we
  thought we would be happier on our own, and so we managed to lose the
  Egyptians. There was some risk in our lonely journey along the right bank of
  the river with our left flank quite unprotected, but on the other hand the
  dust of a great body of horsemen would be insufferable. Therefore we set
  forth one evening, mounted upon our camels, with baggage camels in
  attendance, and quite a retinue of servants. In four or five days we reached
  Korosko, where we got boats which took us to the frontier at Wady Halfa,
  while the camels and servants came on by land.</p>

  <p>I shall never forget those days, or rather those nights, for we rose at
  two in the morning and our longest march was before or during the dawn. I am
  still haunted by that purple velvet sky, by those enormous and innumerable
  stars, by the half-moon which moved slowly above us, while our camels with
  their noiseless tread seemed to bear us without effort through a wonderful
  dream world. Scudamore had a beautiful rolling baritone voice, and I can
  still hear it in my memory as it rose and fell in the still desert air. It
  was a wonderful vision, an intermezzo in real life, broken only once by my
  performing the unusual feat of falling off a camel. I have taken many tosses
  off horses, but this was a new experience. You have no proper saddle, but are
  seated upon a curved leather tray, so that when my brute suddenly threw
  himself down on his fore-knees&mdash;he had seen some green stuff on the
  path&mdash;I shot head foremost down his neck. It was like coming down a hose
  pipe in some acrobatic performance, and I reached the ground rather surprised
  but otherwise none the worse.</p>

  <p>One or two pictures rise in mind. One was of some strange aquatic
  lizard&mdash;not a crocodile&mdash;lying on a sand bank. I cracked off my
  Italian revolver, which was more likely to hurt me than the lizard, and I saw
  the strange beast writhe into the stream. Once again, as I settled my couch
  at night, I saw a slug-like creature, with horned projections, the length
  about 18 inches, which moved away and disappeared. It was a death
  adder&mdash;the sort perhaps which took Cleopatra to her fathers. Then again
  we went into a ruined hut to see if we could sleep there. In the dim light of
  our candle we saw a creature which I thought was a mouse rush round and round
  the floor, close to the wall. Then suddenly to my amazement it ran right up
  the wall and down again on to the floor. It was a huge spider, which now
  stood waving its fore-legs at us. To my horror Scudamore sprang into the air,
  and came down upon it, squashing it into a square foot of filth. This was the
  real tarantula, a dangerous creature, and common enough in such places.</p>

  <p>Yet another picture comes very clearly back to me. For some reason we had
  not started in the night, and the early dawn found us still resting in our
  small camp in a grove of palm trees near the path which led along the bank of
  the Nile. I awoke, and, lying in my blankets, I saw an amazing man riding
  along this path. He was a Negroid Nubian, a huge, fierce, hollow-cheeked
  creature, with many silver ornaments upon him. A long rifle projected over
  his back and a sword hung from his side. A more sinister barbaric figure one
  could not imagine, and he was exactly the type of those Mandi raiders against
  whom we had been warned. I never like to be an alarmist, especially among men
  who had seen much of war or danger, so I said nothing, but I managed to stir
  one of my companions, who sighted the newcomer with a muttered "My God!" The
  man rode past us and on northwards, never glancing at our grove. I have no
  doubt that he was really one of our own native tribesmen, for we had some in
  our pay; but had he been the other thing our fate would have been sealed. I
  wrote a short story, "The Three Correspondents," which was suggested by the
  incident.</p>

  <p>A strange wooden-faced Turkish soldier, Yussuf Bey, in the Egyptian
  service, commanding the troops at Korosko, had us up in audience, gave us
  long pink glasses of raspberry vinegar, and finally saw us on board the boat
  which in a day or two deposited us on the busy river-bank of Wady Haifa,
  where the same military bustle prevailed as we had left behind us at
  Assouan.</p>

  <p>Haifa lies also at the base of a cataract, and again all the stuff had to
  be transhipped and sent on 30 miles by a little track to Sarras. I walked the
  first day to the small station where the track began, and I saw a tall
  officer in a white jacket and red tarboosh, who with a single orderly was
  superintending the work and watching the stores pass into the trucks. He
  turned a fierce red face upon me, and I saw that it was Kitchener himself,
  the Commander of the whole army. It was characteristic of the man that he did
  not leave such vital things to chance, or to the assurance of some
  subordinate, but that he made sure so far as he could with his own eyes that
  he really had the tools for the job that lay before him. Learning who I
  was&mdash;we had met once before on the racecourse at Cairo&mdash;he asked me
  to dinner in his tent that night, when he discussed the coming campaign with
  great frankness. I remember that his chief-of-staff&mdash;Drage, I think, was
  the name&mdash;sat beside me and was so completely played out that he fell
  asleep between every course. I remember also the amused smile with which
  Kitchener regarded him. You had to go all out when you served such a
  master.</p>

  <p>One new acquaintance whom I made in those days was Herbert Gwynne, a
  newly-fledged war correspondent, acting, if I remember right, for the
  "Chronicle." I saw that he had much in him. When I heard of him next he was
  Reuter's man in the Boer War, and not very long afterwards he had become
  editor of the "Morning Post," where he now is. Those days in Haifa were the
  beginning of a friendship of thirty years, none the less real because we are
  both too busy to meet. One of the joys of the hereafter is, I think, that we
  have time to cultivate our friends.</p>

  <p>I was friendly also with a very small but gallant officer one Anley, who
  had just joined the Egyptian Army. His career was beginning and I foresaw
  that he would rise, but should have been very surprised had I known how we
  should meet again. I was standing in the ranks by the roadside as a private
  of Volunteers in the Great War when a red-tabbed, brass-hatted general
  passed. He looked along our ranks, his gaze fastened on me, and lo, it was
  Anley. Surprised out of all military etiquette, he smiled and nodded. What is
  a private in the ranks to do when a general smiles and nods? He can't
  formally stand to attention or salute. I fear that what I did was to close
  and then open my left eye. That was how I learned that my Egyptian captain
  was now a war brigadier.</p>

  <p>We pushed on to Sarras and had a glimpse of the actual outpost of
  civilization, all sandbags and barbed wire, for there was a Mandi post at no
  distance up the river. It was wonderful to look south and to see distant
  peaks said to be in Dongola, with nothing but savagery and murder lying
  between. There was a whiff of real war in the little fortress but no sign of
  any actual advance.</p>

  <p>Indeed, I had the assurance of Kitchener himself that there was no use my
  waiting and that nothing could possibly happen until the camels were
  collected&mdash;many thousands of them. I contributed my own beast to the
  army's need since I had no further use for it, and Corbett and I prepared to
  take our leave. We were warned that our only course was to be on the look out
  and take a flying jump on to any empty cargo boat which was going down
  stream. This we did one morning, carrying our scanty belongings. Once on
  board we learned that there was no food and that the boat did not stop for
  several days. The rope had not been cast off, so I rushed to the only shop
  available, a Greek store of a type which springs up like mushrooms on the
  track of an army. They were sold out save for tinned apricots, of which I
  bought several tins. I rushed back and scrambled on board as the boat cast
  off. We managed to get some Arab bread from the boatmen, and that with the
  apricots served us all the way. I never wish to see a tinned apricot so long
  as I live. I associate their cloying sweetness with Rousseau's "Confessions,"
  a French edition of which came somehow into my hands and was my only reading
  till I saw Assouan once more. Rousseau also I never wish to read again.</p>

  <p>So that was the end of our frontier adventure. We had been on the edge of
  war but not in it. It was disappointing, but it was late in April before I
  reached Cairo, and the heat was already becoming too much for an invalid. A
  week later we were in London, and I remember that, as I sat as a guest at the
  Royal Academy Banquet on May 1 of that year, I saw upon my wrists the ragged
  little ulcers where the poisonous jiggers which had burrowed into my skin
  while I lay upon the banks of the Nile were hatching out their eggs under the
  august roof of Burlington House.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-15"
     id="ch-15"></a>XV &mdash; AN INTERLUDE OF PEACE</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">Hindhead&mdash;"Rodney Stone"&mdash;"A Duet"&mdash;A
  Haunted House&mdash;A Curious Society&mdash;Preternatural Powers&mdash;The
  Little Doctor&mdash;The Shadow of Africa.</p><br>

  <p class="first">WHEN we returned to England I found that the house in which
  we hoped that the cure would be completed was not yet ready. It was a
  considerable mansion planned upon a large scale, so that it was not
  surprising that it had taken some time to build. We were compelled to take a
  furnished house at Haslemere until the early months of 1897, when we moved up
  to Moorlands, a boarding house on Hind-head close to the site of my building.
  There we spent some happy and busy months until the house was ready in the
  summer. I had taken up riding, and though I was never a great horseman I was
  able from that time onwards to get a good deal of health and pleasure out of
  it, for in that woody, heathy country there are beautiful rides in every
  direction, and the hunting, in which I joined, was at least picturesque.
  About June we moved into the new house, which I called Undershaw&mdash;a new
  word, I think, and yet one which described it exactly in good Anglo-Saxon,
  since it stood under a hanging grove of trees.</p>

  <p>I have said little, during these years spent in the quest of health,
  concerning my literary production. The chief book which I had written since
  "The Refugees" was a study of' the Regency with its bucks and prizefighters.
  I had always a weakness for the old fighting men and for the lore of the
  prize-ring, and I indulged it in this novel. At the time boxing had not
  gained the popular vogue which I have been told that this very book first
  initiated, and I can never forget the surprise of Sir George Newnes when he
  found out what the new serial was about. "Why that subject of all subjects
  upon earth?" he cried. However, I think that the readers of "The Strand"
  found that I had not chosen badly, and the book is one which has held a
  permanent place as a picture of those wild old days. I wrote a considerable
  number of short tales during those years, and finally in 1898 a domestic
  study, "A Duet," which was an attempt at quite a different form of
  literature&mdash;a picture in still life, as it were. It was partly
  imaginative and partly founded upon early experiences of my own and of
  friends. It led, I remember, to a public bickering with a man who has done
  good work as a critic, Dr. Robertson Nicoll. He took exception to some
  passage in the book, which he had every right to do. But he wrote at that
  time for six or seven papers, under different names, so that it appeared as
  if a number of critics were all condemning me when it was really only one. I
  thought I had a grievance, and said so with such vehemence that he stated
  that he did not know whether to answer me in print or in the law courts.
  However, it all blew over and we became very good friends. Another book of
  those days was "Uncle Bernac," which I never felt to be satisfactory, though
  I venture to claim that the two chapters which portray Napoleon give a
  clearer picture of him than many a long book has done, which is natural
  enough, since they are themselves the quintessence of a score of books.</p>

  <p>So much for my work. I had everything in those few years to make a man
  contented, save only the constant illness of my partner. And yet my soul was
  often troubled within me. I felt that I was born for something else, and yet
  I was not clear what that something might be. My mind felt out continually
  into the various religions of the world. I could no more get into the old
  ones, as commonly received, than a man could get into his boy's suit. I still
  argued on materialist lines. I subscribed to the Rationalist Association and
  read all their literature carefully, but it was entirely destructive and one
  cannot permanently live on that alone. Besides, I was sure enough of psychic
  phenomena to be aware that there was a range of experience there which was
  entirely beyond any rational explanation, and that therefore a system which
  ignored a great body of facts, and was incompatible with them, was
  necessarily an imperfect system. On the other hand, convinced as I was of
  these abnormal happenings, and that intelligence, high or low, lay behind
  them, I by no means understood their bearing. I still confused the knocking
  at the door with the friend outside, or the ringing of the bell with the
  telephone message. Sometimes I had the peace of despair, when one felt that
  one could never possibly arrive at any conclusions save negative ones, and
  then again some fresh impulse of the soul would start one upon a new quest.
  In every direction I reached out, but never yet with any absolute
  satisfaction. I should have been relieved from all my troubles could I have
  given heartfelt adhesion to any form of orthodoxy&mdash;but my reason always
  barred the way.</p>

  <p>During all the Egyptian and other periods of our exile I had never ceased
  to take the psychic subject very seriously, to read eagerly all that I could
  get, and from time to time to organize séances which gave indifferent but not
  entirely negative results, though we had no particular medium to help us. The
  philosophy of the subject began slowly to unfold, and it was gradually made
  more feasible, not only that life carried on, enclosed in some more tenuous
  envelope, but that the conditions which it encountered in the beyond were not
  unlike those which it had known here. So far I had got along the road, but
  the overwhelming and vital importance of it all had not yet been borne in
  upon me.</p>

  <p>Now and then I had a psychic experience somewhat outside the general run
  of such events. One of these occurred when I was at Norwood in 1892 or 1893.
  I was asked by the Society of Psychic Research whether I would join a small
  committee to sit in and report upon a haunted house at Charmouth in
  Dorchester. I went down accordingly together with a Dr. Scott and Mr.
  Podmore, a man whose name was associated with such investigations. I remember
  that it took us the whole railway journey from Paddington to read up the
  evidence as to the senseless noises which had made life unendurable for the
  occupants, who were tied by a lease and could not get away. We sat up there
  two nights. On the first nothing occurred. On the second Dr. Scott left us
  and I sat up with Mr. Podmore. We had, of course, taken every precaution to
  checkmate fraud, putting worsted threads across the stairs, and so on.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the night a fearsome uproar broke out. It was like some
  one belabouring a resounding table with a heavy cudgel. It was not an
  accidental creaking of wood, or anything of that sort, but a deafening row.
  We had all doors open, so we rushed at once into the kitchen, from which the
  sound had surely come. There was nothing there&mdash;doors were all locked,
  windows barred, and threads unbroken. Pod-more took away the light and
  pretended that we had both returned to our sitting-room, going off with the
  young master of the house, while I waited in the dark in the hope of a return
  of the disturbance. None came&mdash;or ever did come. What occasioned it we
  never knew. It was of the same character as all the other disturbances we had
  read about, but shorter in time. But there was a sequel to the story. Some
  years later the house was burned down, which may or may not have a bearing
  upon the sprite which seemed to haunt it, but a more suggestive thing is that
  the skeleton of a child about ten years old was dug up in the garden. This I
  give on the authority of a relation of the family who were so plagued. The
  suggestion was that the child had been done to death there long ago, and that
  the subsequent phenomena of which we had one small sample were in some way a
  sequence to this tragedy. There is a theory that a young life cut short in
  sudden and unnatural fashion may leave, as it were, a store of unused
  vitality which may be put to strange uses. The unknown and the marvellous
  press upon us from all sides. They loom above us and around us in undefined
  and fluctuating shapes, some dark, some shimmering, but all warning us of the
  limitations of what we call matter, and of the need for spirituality if we
  are to keep in touch with the true inner facts of life.</p>

  <p>I was never asked for a report of this case, but Podmore sent one in,
  attributing the noises to the young man, though as a fact he was actually
  sitting with us in the parlour when the tumult broke out. A confederate was
  possible, though we had taken every step to bar it, but the explanation given
  was absolutely impossible. I learned from this, what I have often confirmed
  since, that while we should be most critical of all psychic assertions, if we
  are to get at the truth, we should be equally critical of all negatives and
  especially of so-called "exposures" in this subject. Again and again I have
  probed them and found them to depend upon prejudice or upon an imperfect
  acquaintance with psychic law.</p>

  <p>This brings me to another curious experience which occurred about this
  time, probably in 1898. There was a small doctor dwelling near me, small in
  stature, and also, I fear, in practice, whom I will call Brown. He was a
  student of the occult, and my curiosity was aroused by learning that he had
  one room in his house which no one entered except himself, as it was reserved
  for mystic and philosophic purposes. Finding that I was interested in such
  subjects, Dr. Brown suggested one day that I should join a secret society of
  esoteric students. The invitation had been led up to by a good deal of
  preparatory inquiry. The dialogue between us ran somewhat thus:</p>

  <p>"What shall I get from it?"</p>

  <p>"In time, you will get powers."</p>

  <p>"What sort of powers?"</p>

  <p>"They are powers which people would call supernatural. They are perfectly
  natural, but they are got by knowledge of deeper forces of nature."</p>

  <p>"If they are good, why should not every one know them?"</p>

  <p>"They would be capable of great abuse in the wrong hands."</p>

  <p>"How can you prevent their getting into wrong hands?"</p>

  <p>"By carefully examining our initiates."</p>

  <p>"Should I be examined?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"By whom?"</p>

  <p>"The people would be in London."</p>

  <p>"Should I have to present myself?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, they would do it without your knowledge."</p>

  <p>"And after that?"</p>

  <p>"You would then have to study."</p>

  <p>"Study what?"</p>

  <p>"You would have to learn by heart a considerable mass of material. That
  would be the first thing."</p>

  <p>"If this material is in print, why does it not become public
  property?"</p>

  <p>"It is not in print. It is in manuscript. Each manuscript is carefully
  numbered and trusted to the honour of a passed initiate. We have never had a
  case of one going wrong."</p>

  <p>"Well," said I, "it is very interesting and you can go ahead with the next
  step, whatever it may be."</p>

  <p>Some little time later&mdash;it may have been a week&mdash;I awoke in the
  very early morning with a most extraordinary sensation. It was not a
  nightmare or any prank of a dream. It was quite different from that, for it
  persisted after I was wide awake. I can only describe it by saying that I was
  tingling all over. It was not painful, but it was queer and disagreeable, as
  a mild electric shock would be. I thought at once of the little doctor.</p>

  <p>In a few days I had a visit from him. "You have been examined and you have
  passed," said he with a smile. "Now you must say definitely whether you will
  go on with it. You can't take it up and drop it. It is serious, and you must
  leave it alone or go forward with a whole heart."</p>

  <p>It began to dawn upon me that it really was serious, so serious that there
  seemed no possible space for it in my very crowded and pre-occupied life. I
  said as much, and he took it in very good part. "Very well," said he, "we
  won't talk of it any more unless you change your mind."</p>

  <p>There was a sequel to the story. A month or two later, on a pouring wet
  day, the little doctor called, bringing with him another medical man whose
  name was familiar to me in connection with exploration and tropical service.
  They sat together beside my study fire and talked. One could not but observe
  that the famous and much-travelled man was very deferential to the little
  country surgeon, who was the younger of the two.</p>

  <p>"He is one of my initiates," said the latter to me. "You know," he
  continued, turning to his companion, "Doyle nearly joined us once." The other
  looked at me with great interest and then at once plunged into a conversation
  with his mentor as to the wonders he had seen and, as I understood, actually
  done. I listened amazed. It sounded like the talk of two lunatics. One phrase
  stuck in my memory.</p>

  <p>"When first you took me up with you," said he, "and we were hovering over
  the town I used to live in, in Central Africa, I was able for the first time
  to see the islands out in the lake. I always knew they were there, but they
  were too far off to be seen from the shore. Was it not extraordinary that I
  should first see them when I was living in England?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Brown, smoking his pipe and staring into the fire. "We had
  some fun in those days. Do you remember how you laughed when we made the
  little steamboat and it ran along the upper edge of the clouds?"</p>

  <p>There were other remarks as wild. "A conspiracy to impress a simpleton,"
  says the sceptic. Well, we can leave it at that if the sceptic so wills, but
  I remain under the impression that I brushed against something strange, and
  something which I am not sorry that I avoided. It was not Spiritualism and it
  was not Theosophy, but rather the acquisition of powers latent in the human
  organization, after the alleged fashion of the old gnostics or of some modern
  fakirs in India, though some doubtless would spell fakirs with an "e." One
  thing I am very sure of, and that is that morals and ethics have to keep pace
  with knowledge, or all is lost. The Maori cannibals had psychic knowledge and
  power, but were man-eaters none the less. Christian ethics can <i>never</i>
  lose its place whatever expansion our psychic faculties may enjoy. But
  Christian theology can and will.</p>

  <p>To return to the little doctor, I came across him again, as psychic as
  ever, in Portland, Oregon, in 1923. From what I learned I should judge that
  the powers of the Society to which he belonged included that of loosening
  their own etheric bodies, in summoning the etheric bodies of others (mine,
  for example) and in making thought images (the steamboat) in the way that we
  are assured is possible by will-power. But their line of philosophy or
  development is beyond me. I believe they represent a branch of the
  Rosicrucians.</p>

  <p>All seemed placid at this time. My wife was holding her own in winter as
  well as in summer. The two children, Mary and Kingsley, were passing through
  the various sweet phases of human development, and brought great happiness
  into our lives. The country was lovely. My life was filled with alternate
  work and sport. As with me so with the nation. They were years of prosperity
  and success. But the shadow of South Africa was falling upon England, and
  before it passed my personal fortunes, as well as so many more, were destined
  to be involved in it. I had a deep respect for the Boers and some fear of
  their skill at arms, their inaccessible situation, and their sturdy Teutonic
  tenacity. I foresaw that they would be a most dangerous enemy, and I watched
  with horror the drift of events which from the time of the ill-judged Jameson
  Raid never ceased to lead to open war. It was almost a relief when at last it
  came and we could clearly see the magnitude of our task. And yet few people
  understood it at the time. On the very eve of war I took the chair at a
  dinner to Lord Wolseley at the Authors' Club and he declared that we could
  send two divisions to Africa. The papers next day were all much exercised as
  to whether such a force was either possible to collect or necessary to send.
  What would they have thought had they been told that a quarter of a million
  men, a large proportion of them cavalry, would be needed before victory could
  be won. The early Boer victories surprised no one who knew something of South
  African history, and they made it clear to every man in England that it was
  not a wine glass but a rifle which one must grasp if the health of the Empire
  was to be honoured.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-16"
     id="ch-16"></a>XVI &mdash; THE START FOR SOUTH AFRICA</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">The Black Week&mdash;Volunteering&mdash;The Langman
  Hospital&mdash;The Voyage&mdash;Bloemfontein&mdash;Sir Claude de
  Crespigny&mdash;The Epidemic&mdash;Advance to the Water Works.</p><br>

  <p class="first">FROM December 10 to 17, 1899, was the black week for
  England. In that week General Gatacre lost a battle at Stormberg, Lord
  Methuen lost one at Magersfontein and General Buller lost one at Colenso. The
  three together would not have made more than a minor action in the great war
  to come, but at the time it seemed portentous. There were ominous stirrings
  on the Continent also and rumours of a coalition. It was lucky for us that
  the German fleet was not yet in being and that our own was able to keep the
  ring, or we should soon have had some Lafayette in South Africa with perhaps
  a Yorktown to follow. However, it was bad enough as it was, but the nation as
  usual rose splendidly to the occasion, and every one hastened to do what they
  could. Hence it was that I found myself early one morning at
  Hounslow&mdash;if I remember right&mdash;standing in a long queue of men who
  were waiting to enlist in the Middlesex Yeomanry. I had one or two friends in
  the regiment and hence my choice.</p>

  <p>The Colonel, a grizzled soldier, sat behind a deal table in an orderly
  room and dealt swiftly with the applicants. He had no idea who I was, but
  seeing a man of forty before him he intimated that I surely did not intend to
  go into the ranks. I said that I was prepared to take a commission. He asked
  if I could ride and shoot. I said that I could do both in moderation. He
  asked if I had had military experience. I said that I had led an adventurous
  life and seen a little of military operations in the Soudan, which was
  stretching it about as far as it would go. Two white lies are permitted to a
  gentleman, to screen a woman, or to get into a fight when the fight is a
  rightful one. So I trust I may be forgiven.</p>

  <p>However the Colonel would only put me on his waiting list, took my name,
  still without recognizing me, and passed on to the next case. I departed
  somewhat crestfallen and unsettled, not knowing whether I had heard the last
  of the matter or not. Almost immediately afterwards, however, I received an
  offer which took me out in a capacity which was less sporting but probably in
  my case and at my age a good deal more useful. This came from my friend John
  Langman, whose son Archie I had known well in Davos days. Langman was sending
  out a hospital of fifty beds at his own expense to Africa, and had already
  chosen his staff of surgeons but not his personnel. Archie Langman was to go
  with the Hospital as general manager. Lang-man's idea was that I should help
  him to choose the personnel, that I should be a supplementary medico, and
  that I should exercise a general supervision over the whole in an unofficial
  capacity. To all this I agreed and spent a week at his house at Stanhope
  Terrace, choosing from many candidates those who seemed the most likely. On
  the whole they proved to be a worthy choice. There were many things to be
  done, and in the middle of them I received a note re-opening the question of
  the Yeomanry, but by this time I was entirely committed to the Langman
  Hospital.</p>

    <p class="caption">Staff of the Langman Hospital, S. Africa, 1900.</p>
  </div>

  <p>When we were complete we were quite a good little unit, but our weakness
  was unfortunately at the head. Dr. O'Callaghan had been a personal friend of
  Lang-man's and had thus got the senior billet, but he was in truth an
  excellent gynaecologist, which is a branch of the profession for which there
  seemed to be no immediate demand. He was a man too who had led a sedentary
  life and was not adapted, with all the will in the world, for the trying
  experience which lay before us. He realized this himself and returned to
  England after a short experience of South African conditions. We were
  compelled to have one military chief, as a bond with the War Office, and this
  proved to be one Major Drury, a most amusing Irishman who might have come
  right out of Lever. To leave the service and to "marry a rich widow with a
  cough" was, he said, the height of his ambition. He was a very pleasant
  companion in civil life, but when it came to duties which needed tact and
  routine he was rather too Celtic in his methods, and this led to friction and
  occasional rows in which I had to sustain the point of view of Mr. Lang-man.
  I have no doubt he thought me an insubordinate dog, and I thought
  him&mdash;well, he has passed away now, and I remember him best as a very
  amusing companion.</p>

  <p>Under O'Callaghan and Drury were two really splendid younger surgeons,
  Charles Gibbs and Scharlieb, the latter the son of the well-known lady
  doctor. They were as good as they could be. Then we had our ward-masters,
  cooks, stewards, storekeepers, and finally some fifteen to twenty orderlies.
  Altogether we numbered just fifty men, and were splendidly fitted out by the
  generosity of Mr. Langman.</p>

  <p>A month or two passed before we could get away, and I remember one amusing
  incident which occurred during that time. I had spent a good deal of thought
  over the problem how best to attack men who lay concealed behind cover. My
  conclusions were that it was useless to fire at them direct, since, if they
  knew their business, very little of them would be vulnerable. On the other
  hand, if one could turn a rifle into a portable howitzer and drop a bullet
  with any sort of rough general accuracy within a given area, then it seemed
  to me that life would hardly be possible within that area. If, for example,
  the position was 20,000 square yards in size, and 20,000 rifles were dropping
  bullets upon it, each square yard would sooner or later be searched and your
  mark would be a whole prostrate or crouching body. What I was really
  evolving, though I could not know it, was the machine gun barrage of dropping
  or vertical fire as practised in the Great War. My principles were absolutely
  right and have not even yet received their full application. I wrote an
  article to "The Times" explaining my views, but so far as I know it had no
  results.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile I was practising how to turn a rifle into a howitzer. I fastened
  a large needle at the end of a thread to the back sight. When the gun pointed
  straight up in the air the needle swung down across the stock and I marked
  the spot. Then the idea was to tilt the gun slowly forward, marking advances
  of 200, 400 and so on in the range, so that you had a dial marked on the
  stock and could always by letting the needle fall across the correct mark on
  the dial drop the bullet within a certain distance.</p>

  <p>But the crux was to discover the exact ranges. To do this I went down to
  Frensham Pond and, standing among the reeds and tilting the gun very slightly
  forward, I pulled the trigger. The bullet very nearly fell upon my own head.
  I could not locate it, but I heard quite a loud thud. But what amazed me, and
  still amazes me, was the time it took. I counted fifty seconds on my watch
  between the discharge and the fall. I don't wonder if the reader is
  incredulous. I feel incredulous also, but such is the fact as I recorded
  it.</p>

  <p>My idea was to mark the bullet splashes on the calm water of the lake, but
  though I fired and fired at various angles not a splash could I see. Finally
  a little man who may have been an artist broke in upon my solitude.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to know where those bullets were going?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I do."</p>

  <p>"Then I can tell you, sir, for they have been dropping all round

  <p>I felt that unless my howitzer was to claim its first victim on the spot I
  had better stop. It was clear that the light bullet with so heavy a charge
  went so high into the atmosphere that one lost all command over it. Twice the
  weight and half the charge would have served my purpose better. Then came
  other calls and I could never work it out, but I am very sure that with a
  little care in detail I could have got a converging fire which would have
  cleared any kopje in South Africa.</p>

  <p>As I was convinced that the idea was both practical and much needed I
  communicated full particulars to the War Office. Here is the letter I had in
  reply.</p>

  <p class="letter">WAR OFFICE,<br>
  <i>Feb</i>. 16, 1900.<br>
  <br>
  SIR,&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  With reference to your letter concerning an appliance for adapting rifles to
  high angle fire I am directed by the Secretary of State for War to inform you
  that he will not trouble you in the matter.<br>
  <br>
  I am, Sir, Your Obedient Servant,<br>
  (Signature illegible),<br>
  Director General of Ordnance.</p>

  <p>Thus, whether my invention was nonsense or whether it was, as I believe,
  radical and epoch-making, I was given no chance to explain or to illustrate
  it. As I remarked in "The Times:" "No wonder that we find the latest
  inventions in the hands of our enemies rather than ourselves if those who try
  to improve our weapons meet with such encouragement as I have done." Our
  traditions were carried on in the Great War, for Pomeroy, the inventor of the
  inflammable bullet which brought down the Zeppelins, was about to return to
  New Zealand in despair and it was as I am assured, private and not official
  bullets which first showed how valuable was his discovery and forced a
  belated acceptance by the War Office.</p>

  <p>At last our time drew near. My wife had gone to Naples, where it was hoped
  that the warmer climate would complete her cure. My affairs were all settled
  up. I was to go as an unpaid man, and I contributed my butler Cleeve, a good
  intelligent man for the general use, paying him myself. In this way I
  retained my independence and could return when I felt that the time had
  come&mdash;which, as events turned out, proved to be very valuable to me.</p>

  <p>We were reviewed by the old Duke of Cambridge in some drill-hall in
  London. There befell me on this occasion one of those quaint happenings which
  seem to me to have been more common in my life than in that of most other
  men. We were drawn up in our new khaki uniforms, and wearing our tropical
  helmets, for the Royal Duke's inspection. If we had been asked to form fours
  we should have broken down completely, but luckily we were placed in double
  line and so we remained. I was standing in front on the right flank. With my
  eyes fixed rigidly before me I was still able out of the corner of them to be
  aware that the old Duke, with his suite, was coming across to begin at my
  end. Presently he halted in front of me, and stood motionless. I remained
  quite rigid, looking past him. He continued to stand, so near me that I could
  hear and almost feel his puffy breath. "What on earth!" I wondered, but I
  gave no sign. At last he spoke. "What is this?" he asked. Then louder, "What
  is this?" and finally, in a sort of ecstasy, "What <i>is</i> it?" I never
  moved an eyelash, but one of a group of journalists upon my right went into
  hysterical but subdued laughter. There was whispering among the suite,
  something was explained, and the funny old man passed on. But did ever Lever
  in his maddest moment represent that his hero on the first day of wearing
  uniform should have such an experience with the ex-Commander-in-Chief of the
  British army and the uncle of the Queen?</p>

  <p>It seems that what was worrying the dear old gentleman&mdash;he was about
  eighty at the time&mdash;was that my tunic buttons had no mark upon them, a
  thing which he had never seen in Her Majesty's Army. Even a crown or a star
  would do, but no mark at all completely upset him, for he was a great
  stickler for correct military clothing. So, of course, was King Edward. A
  friend of mine at a ball in India (royalty being present) was swooped down
  upon by a very agitated aide-de-camp who began: "His Royal Highness desires
  me to say..." and went on to point out some defect in his dress kit. My
  friend answered: "I will mention the matter to my tailor," which was, I
  think, an admirable way of quietly putting the matter into its true
  perspective.</p>

  <p>On this occasion we officers all filed up to be presented and the old Duke
  made amends by blurting out some very kindly things, for it seems that he
  greatly approved of my wooden soldier attitude, in spite of my reprehensible
  buttons. He had a day of agitations, for on the top of the buttons one of the
  curtains of the hotel took fire during our luncheon at Claridge's, and there
  was great excitement for a few moments. He made, I remember, an extremely
  indiscreet speech in which he said: "They turned me off because they said I
  was too old, but old as I am I wouldn't have been such a fool as to&mdash;"
  and then he strung off a number of things which Lord Wolseley, his successor,
  was supposed to have done. The press was merciful and did not report.</p>

  <p>We sailed on February 28, 1900, from Tilbury, in the chartered transport
  <i>Oriental</i>, carrying with us a mixed lot of drafts, and picking up the
  Royal Scots Militia at Queenstown, where a noisy Irishwoman threw a white
  towel on board, crying, "You may be afther finding it useful." The Scots were
  a rather rough crowd with a number of territorial magnates, Lord Henry Scott,
  Lord Tewkesbury, Lord Newport, Lord Brackley and others among their officers.
  Colonel Garstin of the Middlesex was in general command of the whole of us.
  The monotony of the three weeks' voyage was broken only by a cricket match at
  the Cape de Verdes, by a lecture on the war which I delivered on deck under a
  tropical moon to all hands and to an enteric inoculation, which was voluntary
  but should have been compulsory, for even as it was it saved many lives, and
  I am not sure that my own was not among them. The Great War has shown for
  ever how effective this treatment is. We lost more from enteric than from the
  bullet in South Africa, and it is sad to think that nearly all could have
  been saved had Almroth Wright's discovery been properly appreciated. His
  brother was on board, I remember&mdash;an officer of Sappers&mdash;and took
  the virus particularly badly, though all of us were quite bad enough, for the
  right dose had not yet been accurately determined.</p>

  <p>On the evening of March 21 we reached Capetown and found the bay full of
  shipping. There were fifty large steamers at anchor&mdash;mostly empty. Some
  of us had a run ashore, but we had some trouble getting on board again, for
  there was a big swell and the little tug dare not come quite alongside. We
  had to jump therefore from the paddle-box as the roll favoured us, landing on
  a hanging ladder, where a quarter-master seized us. To some people such a
  feat is easy, while others evidently regarded it with horror, and I wondered
  that we escaped from having some tragedy. The only real mishap was a strange
  one. A row of soldier faces was looking down on us over the bulwarks, when I
  saw the grin upon one of them change to a look of horrible agony and he gave
  a wild scream. He still remained standing, but several men ran towards him,
  and then he disappeared. Only afterwards did I learn that a huge iron bar had
  in some way fallen upon his foot, pinning him to the place. He fainted as
  they disengaged him, and was carried below with his bones crushed.</p>

  <p>I spent next day ashore, with the Mount Nelson Hotel as my head-quarters.
  It was full of a strange medley of wounded officers, adventuresses and
  cosmopolitans. Kitchener came down and cleared it out shortly afterwards, for
  the syrens were interfering with his fighting men. The general war news was
  very good. Paardeburg had been fought, Lord Roberts had made his way to
  Bloemfontein and Kimberley had been relieved by French whose immediate return
  to head off Cronje was one of the inspired incidents of the war. It was a
  consolation to find that Boers really could be captured in large numbers, for
  their long run of successes while the conditions were in their favour was
  getting badly upon the public nerves and a legendary sort of atmosphere was
  beginning to build up around them.</p>

  <p>Some money had been given me for charitable purposes when I was in London,
  so I went down to the camp of the Boer prisoners to see if I could spend some
  of it. It was a racecourse, pent in with barbed wire, and they were certainly
  a shaggy, dirty, unkempt crowd but with the bearing of free men. There were a
  few cruel or brutal faces, some of them half caste, but most were good honest
  fellows and the general effect was formidable. There were some who were maned
  like lions. I afterwards went into the tents of the sick Boers. Several were
  sitting sullenly round and one was raving in delirium, saying something in
  his frenzy which set all the others laughing in a mirthless way. One man sat
  in a corner with a proud dark face and brooding eagle eyes. He bowed with
  grave courtesy when I put down some money for cigarettes. A Huguenot, or I am
  mistaken.</p>

  <p>We had been waiting for orders and now we suddenly left Capetown on March
  26, reaching East London on the 28th. There we disembarked, and I was
  surprised to find Leo Trevor, of amateur theatrical fame, acting as transport
  officer. In spite of his efforts (I hope it was not through them) our
  hospital stuff was divided between two trains, and when we reached
  Bloemfontein after days of travel we found that the other half had wandered
  off and was engulfed in the general chaos. There were nights of that journey
  which I shall never forget&mdash;the great train roaring through the
  darkness, the fires beside the line, the dark groups silhouetted against the
  flames, the shouts of "Who are you?" and the crash of voices as our mates
  cried back, "The Camerons," for this famous regiment was our companion.
  Wonderful is the atmosphere of war. When the millennium comes the world will
  gain much, but it will lose its greatest thrill.</p>

  <p>It is a strange wild place, the veldt, with its vast green plains and
  peculiar flat-topped hills, relics of some extraordinary geological episode.
  It is poor pasture&mdash;a sheep to two acres&mdash;so it must always be
  sparsely inhabited. Little white farms, each with its eucalyptus grove and
  its dam, were scattered over it. When we crossed the Free State border by a
  makeshift bridge, beside the ruins of the old one, we noticed that many of
  these little houses were flying the white flag. Every one seemed very
  good-humoured, burghers and soldiers alike, but the guerilla war afterwards
  altered all that.</p>

  <p>It was April 2, and 5 a.m. when we at last reached the capital of the Free
  State, and were dumped down outside the town in a great green expanse covered
  with all sorts of encampments and animals. There was said to be a large force
  of Boers close to the town, and they had cut up one of our columns a few days
  before at Sanna's Post. Some troops were moving out, so I, with Gwynne whom I
  had known in Egypt, and that great sportsman Claude de Crespigny, set forth
  to see what we could, an artilleryman lending me his led horse. There was
  nothing doing, however, for it was Brother Boer's way never to come when you
  wanted him and always when you didn't. Save for good company, I got nothing
  out of a long hot day.</p>

  <p>Good company is always one of the solaces of a campaign. I ran across many
  old friends, some soldiers, some medicos, some journalists. Knight of the
  "Falcon" had, alas, been hit in an early battle and was in hospital. Julian
  Ralph, a veteran American correspondent, Bennett Burleigh the rugged old war
  horse, queer little Melton Prior who looked like the prim headmaster of a
  conventional school, dark-eyed Donohue of the "Chronicle," Paterson the
  Australian, of Snowy River fame, they were a wonderful set of men. I had
  little time to enjoy their society, however, for among the miles of loaded
  trucks which lay at the endless sidings I had to my great joy discovered the
  missing half of our equipment and guided a fatigue party down to it. All day
  we laboured and before evening our beds were up and our hospital ready for
  duty. Two days later wagons of sick and wounded began to disgorge at our
  doors and the real work had begun.</p>

  <p>We had been given the cricket field as our camp and the fine pavilion as
  our chief ward. Others were soon erected, for we had plenty of
  tents&mdash;one each for our own use and a marquee for the mess. We were
  ready for any moderate strain, but that which was put upon us was altogether
  beyond our strength and for a month we had a rather awful time. The first
  intimation of trouble came to me in a simple and dramatic way. We had a bath
  in the pavilion and I had gone up to it and turned the tap, but not a drop of
  water appeared, though it had been running freely the night before. This
  small incident was the first intimation that the Boers had cut the water
  supply of the town, which caused us to fall back upon the old wells, which in
  turn gave rise to an outbreak of enteric which cost us 5,000 lives. The one
  great blot in Lord Roberts' otherwise splendid handling of the campaign was,
  in my opinion, that he did not buzz out at once with every man he could
  raise, and relieve the water works, which were only 20 miles away. Instead of
  this he waited for his army to recuperate; and so exposed them to the
  epidemic. However, it is always easy to be wise after the event.</p>

  <p>The outbreak was a terrible one. It was softened down for public
  consumption and the press messages were heavily censored, but we lived in the
  midst of death&mdash;and death in its vilest, filthiest form. Our
  accommodation was for fifty patients, but 120 were precipitated upon us, and
  the floor was littered between the beds with sick and often dying men. Our
  linen and utensils were never calculated for such a number, and as the nature
  of the disease causes constant pollution, and this pollution of the most
  dangerous character and with the vilest effluvia, one can imagine how
  dreadful was the situation. The worst surgical ward after a battle would be a
  clean place compared to that pavilion. At one end was a stage with the scene
  set for "H.M.S. Pinafore." This was turned into latrines for those who could
  stagger so far. The rest did the best they could, and we did the best we
  could in turn. But a Verestschagin would have found a subject in that awful
  ward, with the rows of emaciated men, and the silly childish stage looking
  down upon it all. In the very worst of it two nursing sisters appeared among
  us and never shall I forget what angels of light they appeared, or how they
  nursed those poor boys, swaddling them like babies and meeting every want
  with gentle courage. Thank God, they both came through safe.</p>

  <p>Four weeks may seem a short time in comfort, but it is a very long one
  under conditions such as those, amid horrible sights and sounds and smells,
  while a haze of flies spreads over everything, covering your food and trying
  to force themselves into your mouth&mdash;every one of them a focus of
  disease. It was bad enough when we had a full staff, but soon the men began
  to wilt under the strain. They were nearly all from the Lancashire cotton
  mills, little, ill-nourished fellows but with a great spirit. Of the fifteen
  twelve contracted the disease and added to the labours of the survivors.
  Three died. Fortunately we of the staff were able to keep going, and we were
  reinforced by a Dr. Schwartz of Capetown. The pressure was great, but we were
  helped by the thought that the greater the work the more we proved the
  necessity of our presence in Africa. Above all, our labours were lightened by
  the splendid stuff that we had for patients. It was really glorious to see
  the steady patience with which they bore their sufferings. The British
  soldier may grouse in days of peace, but I never heard a murmur when he was
  faced with this loathsome death.</p>

  <p>Our hospital was no worse off than the others, and as there were many of
  them the general condition of the town was very bad. Coffins were out of the
  question, and the men were lowered in their brown blankets into shallow
  graves at the average rate of sixty a day. A sickening smell came from the
  stricken town. Once when I had ridden out to get an hour or two of change,
  and was at least 6 miles from the town the wind changed and the smell was all
  around me. You could smell Bloemfontein long before you could see it. Even
  now if I felt that low deathly smell, compounded of disease and disinfectants
  my heart would sink within me.</p>

  <p>At last there came the turn. The army had moved on. Hospitals up the line
  absorbed some of the cases. Above all the water works had been retaken, and
  with hardly any resistance. I went out with the force which was to retake it,
  and slept for the night in a thin coat under a wagon, an experience which
  left me colder than I can ever remember being in my life&mdash;a cold which
  was not only on the surface, but like some solid thing within you. Next
  morning there was every prospect of a battle, for we had been shelled the
  night before and it looked as if the position would be held, so Ian Hamilton,
  who commanded, made a careful advance. However, there was no resistance, and
  save for some figures watching us from distant hills there was no sign of the
  enemy. He had slipped away in the night.</p>

  <p>In the advance we passed over the Drift at Sanna's Post where the disaster
  had occurred some weeks before. The poor artillery horses were still lying in
  heaps where they had been shot down, and the place was covered with every
  kind of litter&mdash;putties, cholera belts, haversacks, and broken helmets.
  There were great numbers of Boer cartridge papers which were all marked
  "Split Bullets. Manufactured for the Use of the British Government, London."
  What the meaning of this was, or where they came from, I cannot imagine, for
  certainly our fellows had always the solid Lee-Metford bullet, as I can swear
  after inspecting many a belt. It sounded like some ingenious trick to excuse
  atrocities, and yet on the whole the Boer was a fair and good-humoured
  fighter until near the close of the war.</p>

  <p>The move of Hamilton's was really the beginning of the great advance, and
  having cleared the water works he turned north and became the right wing of
  the army. On his left was Tucker's 7th Division, then Kelly Kenny's 6th
  Division, Pole-Carew's 1st Division, including the Guards, and finally a
  great horde of mounted infantry, including the Yeomanry, the Colonial and the
  Irregular Corps. This was the great line which set forth early in May to
  sweep up from Bloemfontein to Pretoria. Things had become more quiet at the
  hospital and presently Archie Langman and I found a chance to get away and to
  join the army at the first stage of its advance. I wrote our experience out
  while it was still fresh in my mind, and the reader will forgive me if I
  reproduce some of this, as it is likely to be more vivid and more detailed
  than the blurred impression now left in my memory after more than twenty
  years.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-17"
     id="ch-17"></a>XVII &mdash; DAYS WITH THE ARMY</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">Pole-Carew&mdash;Tucker&mdash;Snipers&mdash;The Looted
  Farm&mdash;Taking of Brandfort&mdash;Artillery Engagement&mdash;Advance of
  the Guards&mdash;The Wounded Scout&mdash;The Dead
  Australian&mdash;Return.</p><br>

  <p class="first">STAND in the pass at Karee, and look north in the clear
  fresh morning air! Before you lies a great plain, dull green, with white
  farmhouses scattered here and there. One great donga slashes it across.
  Distant hills bound it on all sides, and at the base of those in front, dimly
  seen, are a line of houses and a steeple. This is Brandfort, 10 miles off,
  and we are advancing to attack it.</p>

  <p>The troops are moving forward, line after line of red face and khaki, with
  rumbling columns of guns. Two men sit their horses beside us on a knoll, and
  stare with their glasses at the distant houses. Gallant figures both of them;
  the one spruce, debonnaire, well-groomed, with laughing eyes and
  upward-curved moustache, a suggestion of schoolboy mischief about his
  handsome face; the other, grim, fierce, all nose and eyebrow, white scales of
  sun-dried skin hanging from his brick-red face. The first is Pole-Carew,
  General of Division; the second is Brigadier Stephenson. We are finding our
  men, and these are among them.</p>

  <p>Here is another man worth noting. You could not help noting him if you
  tried. A burly, broad-shouldered man, with full, square, black beard over his
  chest, his arm in a sling, his bearing a medieval knight-errant. It is
  Crabbe, of the Grenadier Guards. He reins his horse for an instant while his
  Guardsmen stream past him.</p>

  <p>"I've had my share&mdash;four bullets already. Hope I won't get another
  to-day."</p>

  <p>"You should be in hospital."</p>

  <p>"Ah, there I must venture to disagree with you." He rides on with his
  men.</p>

  <p>Look at the young officers of the Guards, the dandies of Mayfair. No
  carpet soldiers, these, but men who have spent six months upon the veldt, and
  fought from Belmont to Bloemfontein. Their walk is dainty, their putties are
  well rolled&mdash;there is still the suggestion of the West End.</p>

  <p>If you look with your glasses on the left you may see movement on the
  farthest skyline. That is Hutton's Mounted Infantry, some thousands of them,
  to turn the flank of any resistance. As far as you can see to the right is
  Tucker's Division. Beyond that again are Ian Hamilton's Mounted Infantry and
  French's Cavalry. The whole front is a good 30 miles, and 35,000 men go to
  the making of it.</p>

  <p>Now we advance over the great plain, the infantry in extended order, a
  single company covering half a mile. Look at the scouts and the
  flankers&mdash;we should not have advanced like that six months ago. It is
  not our additional numbers so much as our new warcraft which makes us
  formidable. The big donga is only 2,000 yards off now, so we halt and have a
  good look at it. Guns are unlimbered&mdash;just as well to be ready.
  Pole-Carew rides up like a schoolboy on a holiday.</p>

  <p>"Who's seen old Tucker?" I hear him say, with his glasses to his eyes. He
  had sent a message to the scouts. "There now, look at that aide of mine. He
  has galloped along the donga to see if any Boers are in it. What right had he
  to do that? When I ask him he will say that he thought I was there...Halloa,
  you, sir, why don't you come back straight?"</p>

  <p>"I did, sir."</p>

  <p>"You didn't. You rode along that donga."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were there, sir."</p>

  <p>"Don't add lying to your other vices."</p>

  <p>The aide came grinning back. "I was fired at, but I dare not tell the old
  man."</p>

  <p>Rap! Rap! Rap! Rifles in front. Every one pricks up his ears. Is it the
  transient sniper or the first shot of a battle? The shots come from the
  farmhouse yonder. The 83rd Field Battery begin to fidget about their guns.
  The officer walks up and down and stares at the farmhouse. From either side
  two men pull out lines of string and give long, monotonous cries. They are
  the range-finders. A gunner on the limber is deep in a sixpenny magazine,
  absorbed, his chin on his hand.</p>

  <p>"Our scouts are past the house," says an officer.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," says the major.</p>

  <p>The battery limbers up and the whole force advances to the farmhouse.
  Off-saddle and a halt for luncheon.</p>

  <p>Halloa! Here are new and sinister developments. A Tommy drives a smart
  buggy and pair out of the yard, looted for the use of the army. The farm is
  prize of war, for have they not fired at our troops? They could not help the
  firing, poor souls, but still this sniping must be discouraged. We are taking
  off our gloves at last over this war. But the details are not pretty.</p>

  <p>A frightened girl runs out.</p>

  <p>"Is it right that they kill fowls?" Alas! the question is hardly worth
  debating, for the fowls are dead. Erect and indignant, the girl drives in her
  three young turkeys. Men stare at her curiously, but she and her birds are
  not molested.</p>

  <p>Here is something worse. A fat white pig all smothered in blood runs past.
  A soldier meets it, his bayonet at the charge. He lunges and lunges again,
  and the pig screams horribly. I had rather see a man killed. Some are up in
  the loft throwing down the forage. Others root up the vegetables. One drinks
  milk out of a strange vessel, amid the laughter of his comrades. It is a
  grotesque and medieval scene.</p>

  <p>The General rides up, but he has no consolation for the women. "The farm
  has brought it upon itself." He rides away again.</p>

  <p>A parson rides up. "I can't imagine why they don't burn it," says he.</p>

  <p>A little Dutch boy stares with large, wondering grey eyes. He will tell
  all this to his grandchildren when we are in our graves.</p>

  <p>"War is a terrible thing," says the mother, in Dutch. The Tommies, with
  curious eyes, cluster round the doors and windows, staring in at the family.
  There is no individual rudeness.</p>

  <p>One Kaffir enters the room. "A Kaffir!" cries the girl, with blazing
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, a Kaffir," says he defiantly&mdash;but he left.</p>

  <p>"They won't burn the house, will they?" cries the mother.</p>

  <p>"No, no," we answer; "they will not burn the house."</p>

  <p>We advance again after lunch, the houses and steeple much nearer.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Cannon at last!</p>

  <p>But it is far away, over at Tucker's side. There are little white puffs on
  the distant green hills. Those are shells bursting. If you look through your
  glasses you will see&mdash;eight miles off&mdash;a British battery in action.
  Sometimes a cloud of dust rises over it. That is a Boer shell which has
  knocked up the dust. No Boers can be seen from here.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>It becomes monotonous. "Old Tucker is getting it hot!" Bother old Tucker,
  let us push on to Brandfort.</p>

  <p>On again over the great plain, the firing dying away on the right. We have
  had a gun knocked off its wheels and twelve men hit over there. But now
  Hutton's turning movement is complete, and they close in on the left of
  Brandfort. A pom-pom quacks like some horrid bird among the hills. Our horse
  artillery are banging away. White spurts of shrapnel rise along the ridge.
  The leading infantry bend their backs and quicken their pace. We gallop to
  the front, but the resistance has collapsed. The mounted men are riding
  forward and the guns are silent. Long, sunlit hills stretch peacefully before
  us.</p>

  <p>I ride through the infantry again. "The bloody blister on my toe has
  bust." "This blasted water-bottle!" Every second man has a pipe between his
  parched lips.</p>

  <p>The town is to the right, and two miles of plain intervene. On the plain a
  horseman is rounding up some mares and foals. I recognize him as I
  pass&mdash;Burdett-Coutts&mdash;a well-known figure in society. Mr. Maxwell
  of the "Morning Post" suggests that we ride to the town and chance it. "Our
  men are sure to be there." No sign of them across the plain, but we will try.
  He outrides me, but courteously waits, and we enter the town together. Yes,
  it's all right; there's a Rimington Scout in the main street&mdash;a group of
  them.</p>

  <p>A young Boer, new caught, stands among the horsemen. He is
  discomposed&mdash;not much. A strong, rather coarse face; well-dressed; might
  appear, as he stands, in an English hunting-field as a young yeoman
  farmer.</p>

  <p>"Comes of being fond of the ladies," said the Australian sergeant.</p>

  <p>"Wanted to get her out of the town," said the Boer. Another was brought
  up. "I'd have got off in a minute," says he.</p>

  <p>"You'd have got off as it was if you had the pluck of a louse," says his
  captor. The conversation languished after that.</p>

  <p>In came the Staff, galloping grandly. The town is ours.</p>

  <p>A red-headed Irish-American is taken on the kopje. "What the hell is that
  to you?" he says to every question. He is haled away to gaol&mdash;a
  foul-mouthed blackguard.</p>

  <p>We find the landlady of our small hotel in tears&mdash;her husband in
  gaol, because a rifle has been found. We try to get him out, and succeed. He
  charges us 4s. for half a bottle of beer, and we wonder whether we cannot get
  him back into gaol again.</p>

  <p>"The house is not my own. I find great burly men everywhere," he cries,
  with tears in his eyes. His bar is fitted with pornographic pictures to amuse
  our simple farmer friends&mdash;not the first or the second sign which I have
  seen that pastoral life and a Puritan creed do not mean a high public
  morality.</p>

  <p>We sit on the stoep and smoke in the moonlight. There comes a drunken
  inhabitant down the main street. A dingy Tommy stands on guard in front.</p>

  <p>"Halt! Who goes there?"</p>

  <p>"A friend."</p>

  <p>"Give the countersign!"</p>

  <p>"I'm a free-born Englishman!"</p>

  <p>"Give the countersign!"</p>

  <p>"I'm a freeborn&mdash;" With a rattle the sentry's rifle came to his
  shoulder and the moon glinted on his bayonet.</p>

  <p>"Hi, stop!" cries a senior Correspondent. "You Juggins, you'll be shot!
  Don't fire, sentry!"</p>

  <p>Tommy raised his rifle reluctantly and advanced to the man. "What shall I
  do with him, sir?" he asked the Correspondent.</p>

  <p>"Oh, what you like!" He vanished out of history.</p>

  <p>I talk politics with Free Staters. The best opening is to begin, in an
  inquiring tone, "Why did you people declare war upon us?" They have got into
  such an injured-innocence state that it comes quite as a shock to them when
  they are reminded that they were the attackers. By this Socratic method one
  attains some interesting results. It is evident that they all thought they
  could win easily, and that they are very bitter now against the Transvaal.
  They are mortally sick of the war; but, for that matter, so are most of the
  British officers. It has seemed to me sometimes that it would be more
  judicious, and even more honourable, if some of the latter were less open
  about the extent to which they are "fed-up." It cannot be inspiriting for
  their men. At the same time there would be a mutiny in the Army if any
  conditions short of absolute surrender were accepted&mdash;and in spite of
  their talk, if a free pass were given to-day, I am convinced that very few
  officers would return until the job was done.</p>

  <p>Our railway engineers are great. The train was in Brandfort next day, in
  spite of broken bridges, smashed culverts, twisted metals, every sort of
  wrecking. So now we are ready for another 20 miles Pretoriawards. The Vet
  River is our goal this time, and off we go with the early morning.</p>

  <p>Another great green plain, with dotted farms and the huge khaki column
  slowly spreading across it. The day was hot, and 10 miles out the Guards had
  about enough. Stragglers lay thick among the grass, but the companies kept
  their double line formation, and plodded steadily along. Ten miles sounds
  very little, but try it in the dust of a column on a hot day, with a rifle
  over your shoulder, a hundred rounds of ammunition, a blanket, a canteen, an
  empty water-bottle, and a dry tongue.</p>

  <p>A grey-bearded padre limped bravely beside his men.</p>

  <p>"No, no," says he, when offered my horse. "I must not spoil my
  record."</p>

  <p>The men are silent on the march; no band, no singing.</p>

  <p>Grim and sullen, the column flows across the veldt. Officers and men are
  short in their tempers.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you," etc., etc., bleats a subaltern.</p>

  <p>"Because I never can hear what you say," says the corporal.</p>

  <p>They halt for a midday rest, and it seems to me, as I move among them,
  that there is too much nagging on the part of the officers. We have paid too
  much attention to the German military methods. Our true model should have
  been the American, for it is what was evolved by the Anglo-Celtic race in the
  greatest experience of war which the Anglo-Celtic race has ever had.</p>

  <p>On we go again over that great plain. Is there anything waiting for us
  down yonder where the low kopjes lie? The Boers have always held rivers. They
  held the Modder. They held the Tugela. Will they hold the Vet? Halloa, what's
  this?</p>

  <p>A startled man in a night-cap on a dapple-grey horse. He gesticulates.
  "Fifty of them&mdash;hot corner&mdash;lost my helmet." We catch bits of his
  talk. But what's that on the dapple-grey's side? The horse is shot through
  the body. He grazes quietly with black streaks running down the reeking
  hair.</p>

  <p>"A West Australian, sir. They shot turble bad, for we were within 50 yards
  before they loosed off."</p>

  <p>"Which kopje?"</p>

  <p>"That one over yonder."</p>

  <p>We ride forward, and pass through the open ranks of the Guards'
  skirmishers. Behind us the two huge naval guns are coming majestically up,
  drawn by their thirty oxen, like great hock-bottles on wheels. In front a
  battery has unlimbered. We ride up to the side of it. Away in front lies a
  small, slate-roofed farm beside the kopje. The Mounted Infantry have
  coalesced into one body and are moving towards us. "Here's the circus. There
  is going to be a battle," was an infantry phrase in the American War. Our
  circus was coming in, and perhaps the other would follow.</p>

  <p>The battery (84th R.F.A.) settles down to its work.</p>

  <p>Bang! I saw the shell burst on a hillside far away.</p>

  <p>"3,500," says somebody. Bang! "3,250," says the voice. Bang! "3,300." A
  puff shoots up from the distant grey roof as if their chimney were on fire.
  "Got him that time!"</p>

  <p>The game seems to us rather one-sided, but who is that shooting in the
  distance?</p>

  <p>"Wheeeeee"&mdash;what a hungry whine, and then a dull muffled "Ooof!" Up
  goes half a cartload of earth about 100 yards ahead of the battery. The
  gunners take as much notice as if it were a potato.</p>

  <p>"Wheeeeeee&mdash;ooof!" Fifty yards in front this time.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang!" go the crisp English guns.</p>

  <p>"Wheeeeee&mdash;ooof!" Fifty yards behind the battery. They'll get it next
  time as sure as fate. Gunners go on unconcernedly. "Wheeeeee-ooof!" Right
  between the guns, by George! Two guns invisible for the dust. Good heavens,
  how many of our gunners are left? Dust settles, and they are all bending and
  straining and pulling the same as ever.</p>

  <p>Another shell and another, and then a variety, for there comes a shell
  which breaks high up in the air&mdash;wheeeeee&mdash;tang with a musical,
  resonant note, like the snapping of a huge banjo-string, and a quarter of an
  acre of ground spurted into little dust-clouds under the shrapnel. The
  gunners take no interest in it. Percussion or shrapnel, fire what you will,
  you must knock the gun off its wheels or the man off his pins before you
  settle the R.F.A.</p>

  <p>But every shell is bursting true, and it is mere luck that half the
  battery are not down. Once only did I see a man throw back his head a few
  inches as a shell burst before him. The others might have been parts of an
  automatic machine. But the officer decided to shift the guns&mdash;and they
  are shifted. They trot away for half a mile to the right and come into action
  again.</p>

  <p>The lonely hero is the man to be admired. It is easy to be collectively
  brave. A man with any sense of proportion feels himself to be such a mite in
  the presence of the making of history that his own individual welfare seems
  for the moment too insignificant to think of. The unit is lost in the mass.
  But now we find ourselves alone on the plain with the battery away to the
  right.</p>

  <p>The nerves of the novice are strung up by the sound of the shells, but
  there is something of exhilaration in the feeling also.</p>

  <p>There is a fence about 200 yards off, and to this we tether our horses,
  and we walk up and down trying with our glasses to spot where the Boer guns
  are. We have suspicions, but nothing more. Our gunners may know, but we do
  not feel confident about it. Surely the stealthy lurking gun is worth six
  guns which stand bravely forth in the open. These farmers have taught our
  riflemen their business, and they bid fair to alter the artillery systems of
  the world as well. Our guns and theirs are like a fight between a blind man
  and one who can see.</p>

  <p>An artillery colonel is wandering loose, and we talk. He has no job of his
  own, so he comes, like the coachman on a holiday, to watch some other man's
  guns at work. A shell falls some distance short of us.</p>

  <p>"The next one," says the colonel, "will go over our heads. Come and stand
  over here." I do so, with many mental reservations. Wheeeeeeee&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Here it comes!" says the colonel. "Here I go!" think I. It burst on our
  level, but 40 yards to the right. I secure a piece as a souvenir.</p>

  <p>"Shall we wait for another?" I began to be sorry that I met the
  colonel.</p>

  <p>But a new sensation breaks upon us. Looking back we see that two monster
  naval guns are coming into action not fifty yards from our tethered horses,
  which stand in a dead line before their huge muzzles. We only just got them
  clear in time. Bang! the father of all the bangs this time, and a pillar of
  white smoke with a black heart to it on the farther hill. I can see some
  riders, like ants, going across it&mdash;Boers on the trek. Our men take the
  huge brass cartridge-case out of the gun.</p>

  <p>"Can I have that?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," says the lieutenant.</p>

  <p>I tie it on to my saddle, and feel apologetic towards my long-suffering
  horse. The great gun roars and roars and the malignant spouts of smoke rise
  on the farthest hill.</p>

  <p>A line of infantry in very open order comes past the great guns, and I
  advance a little way with them. They are Scots Guards. The first line goes
  forward, the second is halted and lying down.</p>

  <p>"That's right! Show where you are!" cries the second line, derisively. I
  seem to have missed the point, but the young officer in the first line is
  very angry.</p>

  <p>"Hold your tongues&mdash;!" he shouts, with his red face looking over his
  shoulder. "Too many orders. No one gives orders but me." His men lie down.
  The sun is sinking low, and it is evident that the contemplated infantry
  assault will not come off. One of the great naval shells passes high over our
  heads. It is the sound of a distant train in a tunnel.</p>

  <p>A man canters past with a stretcher over his shoulder. His bay horse
  lollops along, but the stretcher makes him look very top-heavy. He passes the
  guns and the infantry, and rides on along the edge of a maize field. He is
  half a mile out now, heading for the kopje. Every instant I expect to see him
  drop from his horse. Then he vanishes in a dip of the ground.</p>

  <p>After a time the stretcher appears again.</p>

  <p>This time two men are carrying it, and the horseman rides beside. I have
  bandages in my pocket, so I ride forward also.</p>

  <p>"Has a surgeon seen him?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir." They lay the man down. There is a handkerchief over his
  face.</p>

  <p>"Where is it?"</p>

  <p>"His stomach and his arm." I pull up his shirt, and there is the Mauser
  bullet lying obvious under the skin. It has gone round instead of
  penetrating. A slit with a pen-knife would extract it, but that had better be
  left for chloroform and the field hospital. Nice clean wound in the arm.</p>

  <p>"You will do very well. What is your name?"</p>

  <p>"Private Smith, sir. New Zealander." I mention my name and the Langman
  Hospital at Bloemfontein.</p>

  <p>"I've read your books," says he, and is carried onwards.</p>

  <p>There has been a lull in the firing and the sun is very low. Then after a
  long interval comes a last Boer shell.</p>

  <p>It is an obvious insult, aimed at nothing, a derisive good-night and
  good-bye. The two naval guns put up their long necks and both roared
  together. It was the last word of the Empire&mdash;the mighty angry voice
  calling over the veldt. The red rim had sunk and all was purple and crimson,
  with the white moon high in the west. What had happened? Who had won? Were
  other columns engaged? No one knew anything or seemed to care. But late at
  night as I lay under the stars I saw on the left front signal flashes from
  over the river, and I knew that Hutton was there.</p>

  <p>So it proved, for in the morning it was over the camp in an instant that
  the enemy had gone. But the troops were early afoot. Long before dawn came
  the weird, muffled tapping of the drums and the crackling of sticks as the
  camp-kettles were heated for breakfast. Then with the first light we saw a
  strange sight. A monstrous blister was rising slowly from the veldt. It was
  the balloon being inflated&mdash;our answer to the lurking guns. We would
  throw away no chances now, but play every card in our hand&mdash;another
  lesson which the war has driven into our proud hearts. The army moved on,
  with the absurd windbag flapping over the heads of the column. We climbed the
  kopjes where the enemy had crouched, and saw the litter of empty Mauser cases
  and the sangars so cunningly built. Among the stones lay a packet of the
  venomous-looking green cartridges still unfired. They talk of poison, but I
  doubt it. Verdigris would be an antiseptic rather than a poison in a wound.
  It is more likely that it is some decomposition of the wax in which the
  bullets are dipped. Brother Boer is not a Bushman after all. He is a tough,
  stubborn fighter, who plays a close game, but does not cheat.</p>

  <p>We say good-bye to the army, for our duty lies behind us and theirs in
  front. For them the bullets, for us the microbes, and both for the honour of
  the flag. Scattered trails of wagons, ambulance carts, private buggies,
  impedimenta of all kinds, radiate out from the army. It is a bad drift, and
  it will be nightfall before they are all over. We pass the last of them, and
  it seems strange to emerge from that great concourse and see the 20 miles of
  broad, lonely plain which lies between us and Brandfort. We shall look rather
  foolish if any Boer horsemen are hanging about the skirts of the army.</p>

  <p>We passed the battlefield of last night, and stopped to examine the holes
  made by the shells. Three had fallen within 10 yards, but the ant-heaps round
  had not been struck, showing how harmless the most severe shellfire must be
  to prostrate infantry. From the marks in the clay the shells were large
  ones&mdash;forty-pounders, in all probability. In a little heap lay the
  complete kit of a Guardsman&mdash;his canteen, water-bottle, cup, even his
  putties. He had stripped for action with a vengeance. Poor devil, how
  uncomfortable he must be to-day!</p>

  <p>A Kaffir on horseback is rounding up horses on the plain. He gallops
  towards us&mdash;a picturesque, black figure on his shaggy Basuto mount. He
  waves his hand excitedly towards the east.</p>

  <p>"Englishman there&mdash;on veldt&mdash;hurt&mdash;Dutchman shoot him." He
  delivers his message clearly enough.</p>

  <p>"Is he alive?" He nods.</p>

  <p>"When did you see him?" He points to the sun and then farther east. About
  two hours ago apparently.</p>

  <p>"Can you take us there?" We buy him for 2s., and all canter off
  together.</p>

  <p>Our road is through maize fields and then out on to the veldt. By Jove,
  what's that? There is a single black motionless figure in the middle of that
  clearing. We gallop up and spring from our horses. A short, muscular, dark
  man is lying there with a yellow, waxen face, and a blood-clot over his
  mouth. A handsome man, black-haired, black moustached, his expression
  serene&mdash;No. 410 New South Wales Mounted Infantry&mdash;shot, overlooked
  and abandoned. There are evident signs that he was not alive when the Kaffir
  saw him. Rifle and horse are gone. His watch lies in front of him, dial
  upwards, run down at one in the morning. Poor chap, he had counted the hours
  until he could see them no longer.</p>

  <p>We examine him for injuries. Obviously he had bled to death. There is a
  horrible wound in his stomach. His arm is shot through. Beside him lies his
  water-bottle&mdash;a little water still in it, so he was not tortured by
  thirst. And there is a singular point. On the water-bottle is balanced a red
  chess pawn. Has he died playing with it? It looks like it. Where are the
  other chessmen? We find them in a haversack out of his reach. A singular
  trooper this, who carries chessmen on a campaign. Or is it loot from a
  farmhouse? I shrewdly suspect it.</p>

  <p>We collect the poor little effects of No. 410&mdash;a bandolier, a
  stylographic pen, a silk handkerchief, a clasp-knife, a Waterbury watch, £2
  6s. 6d. in a frayed purse. Then we lift him, our hands sticky with his blood,
  and get him over my saddle&mdash;horrible to see how the flies swarm
  instantly on to the saddle-flaps. His head hangs down on one side and his
  heels on the other. We lead the horse, and when from time to time he gives a
  horrid dive we clutch at his ankles Thank Heaven, he never fell. It is two
  miles to the road, and there we lay our burden under a telegraph post. A
  convoy is coming up, and we can ask them to give him a decent burial. No. 410
  holds one rigid arm and clenched fist in the air. We lower it, but up it
  springs, menacing, aggressive. I put his mantle over him; but still, as we
  look back, we see the projection of that raised arm. So he met his
  end&mdash;somebody's boy. Fair fight, open air, and a great cause&mdash;I
  know no better death.</p>

  <p>A long, long ride on tired horses over an endless plain. Here and there
  mounted Kaffirs circle and swoop. I have an idea that a few mounted police
  might be well employed in our rear. How do we know what these Kaffirs may do
  among lonely farms held by women and children? Very certain I am that it is
  not their own horses which they are rounding up so eagerly.</p>

  <p>Ten miles have passed, and we leave the track to water our horses at the
  dam. A black mare hard-by is rolling and kicking. Curious that she should be
  so playful. We look again, and she lies very quiet. One more has gone to
  poison the air of the veldt. We sit by the dam and smoke. Down the track
  there comes a Colonial corps of cavalry&mdash;a famous corps, as we see when
  our glasses show us the colour of the cockades. Good heavens, will we never
  have sense beaten into us? How many disasters and humiliations must we endure
  before we learn how to soldier? The regiment passes without a vanguard,
  without scouts, without flankers, in an enemy's country intersected by
  dongas. Oh, for a Napoleon who might meet such a regiment, tear the
  epaulettes of the colonel from his shoulders, Stellenbosch him instantly
  without appeal or argument. Only such a man with such powers can ever
  thoroughly reorganize our army.</p>

  <p>Another six miles over the great plain. Here is a small convoy, with an
  escort of militia, only a mile or two out from Brandfort. They are heading
  wrong, so we set them right. The captain in charge is excited.</p>

  <p>"There are Boers on that hill!" The hill is only half a mile or so away on
  our left; so we find the subject interesting. "Kaffirs!" we suggest.</p>

  <p>"No, no, mounted men with bandoliers and rifles. Why, there they are now."
  We see moving figures, but again suggest Kaffirs. It ends by our both
  departing unconvinced. We thought the young officer jumpy over his first
  convoy, but we owe him an apology, for next morning we learned that the
  Mounted Infantry had been out all night chasing the very men whom we had
  seen. It is likely that the accidental presence of the convoy saved us from a
  somewhat longer journey than we had intended.</p>

  <p>A day at Brandfort, a night in an open truck, and we were back at the Café
  Enterique, Boulevard des Microbes, which is our town address.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-18"
     id="ch-18"></a>XVIII &mdash; FINAL EXPERIENCES IN SOUTH AFRICA</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">Military Jealousies&mdash;Football&mdash;Cracked
  Ribs&mdash;A Mutiny&mdash;De Wet&mdash;A Historian under
  Difficulties&mdash;Pretoria&mdash;Lord Roberts&mdash;With the
  Boers&mdash;Memorable Operation&mdash;Altercation.</p><br>

  <p class="first">MILITARY men are more full of jealousies and more prone to
  divide into cliques than any set of men whom I have met. South Africa was
  rent with their quarrels, and one heard on every side of how General This was
  daggers drawn with General That. But the great cleavage of all was between
  the Roberts men and the Buller men. The former were certainly very bitter
  against the reliever of Ladysmith, and the comments about the difference
  between his evening telegrams and those of next morning were painful to hear.
  I had, however, less sympathy, as Buller was a coarse-fibred man, though a
  brave soldier. Several authentic anecdotes pointed to this want of
  perception. When, for example, he entered Ladysmith the defenders saved up a
  few cakes and other luxuries for the day of their release. These they laid
  before Buller at the welcoming lunch. "I thought you were a starving city,"
  said he, looking round at them. This story I heard from several men who
  claimed to speak with knowledge as well as bitterness. It would have been sad
  had Buller's long meritorious, hard-fighting career gone down in clouds, but
  it cannot be denied that in the French, or I think in any other service, he
  could not have survived Colenso. The strange speech which he made at a London
  luncheon after the war proved, I think, that his mind had lost something of
  its grip of realities. Roberts, as usual, played the noblest possible part in
  this unhappy controversy.</p>

  <p>"I shall handle Buller with all possible tenderness," he said to one of
  his Staff, and he lived up to his words.</p>

  <p>I found the hospital on my return to be in a very improved condition. I
  fell ill myself, however, though it was not serious enough to incapacitate
  me. I still think that if I had not been inoculated I should at that time
  have had enteric, and there was surely something insidious in my system, for
  it was a good ten years before my digestion had recovered its tone. My
  condition was not improved by a severe bruising of the ribs caused by a foul
  in one of the inter-hospital football matches which we had organized in order
  to take the minds of the men from their incessant work. Charles Gibbs
  strapped me up with plaster, as in a corset, but I was getting too old for
  rough handling which I could have smiled at in my youth.</p>

  <p>One quaint memory of those days rises before me.</p>

  <p>There was a sharp quarrel between Drury, our Military C.O. representing
  routine discipline, and our cooks and servants representing civilian ideas of
  liberty. It was mishandled and had reached such a point when I returned from
  the army that the men were on absolute strike, the work was disorganized and
  the patients were suffering. Drury was breathing fire and fury, which only
  made the men more obdurate. It really looked as if there might be a
  considerable scandal, and I felt that it was just such a case as Mr. Langman
  would have wished me to handle. I asked leave of Major Drury, therefore, that
  I might take the matter up, and he was, I fancy, very glad that I should, for
  he was at the end of his resources, and a public exposure of a disorganized
  unit means also a discredited Commander. I therefore sat behind the long mess
  table, and had the six ringleaders before me, all standing in a line with
  sullen mutiny in their faces. I talked to them gently and quietly, saying
  that I was in some sense responsible for them, since several of them had been
  enlisted by me. I sympathized with them in all they had gone through, and
  said that all our nerves had been a little overstrained, but that Duty and
  Discipline must rise above our bodily weakness. No doubt their superiors also
  had been strained and some allowance must be made on both sides. I then took
  a graver tone. "This matter is just going forward for court martial and I
  have intervened at the last instant. You clearly understand your own
  position. You have disobeyed orders on active service in the presence of the
  enemy. There is only one punishment possible for such an offence. It is
  death." Six pairs of eyes stared wildly in front of me. Having produced my
  effect I went into their grievances, promised that they should be considered,
  and demanded an apology to Major Drury as the condition for doing anything
  further. They were six chastened men who filed out of the marquee, the
  apology was forthcoming, and there were no more troubles in the camp.</p>

  <p>An anxiety came to us about this time from a very unexpected cause, for
  Archie Langman, who had been my good comrade in my visit to the army, went
  off again, trekking up country with the Imperial Yeomanry and ran right into
  the arms of De Wet, who had just raided the line and won a small victory at a
  place called Roodeval. The famous guerilla leader was stern but just, and he
  treated the hospital men with consideration, so that Archie returned none the
  worse for his adventure. But there was a bad day or two for me between our
  learning of his capture and of his release.</p>

  <p>The army had got forward with little fighting, and Pretoria was in our
  hands. It seemed to all of us that the campaign was over and that only
  cleaning-up remained to be done. I began to consider my own return to Europe,
  and there were two potent influences which drew me, apart from the fact that
  the medical pressure no longer existed. The first was that I had during all
  this time continued to write the History of the War, drawing my material very
  often from the eye-witnesses to these events. But there was a good deal which
  could only be got at the centre, and therefore if my book was to be ready
  before that of my rivals it was necessary for me to be on the spot. The
  second was that a political crisis and a general election were coming on, and
  it was on the cards that I might be a candidate. I could not, however, leave
  Africa until I had seen Pretoria, so, with some difficulty, I obtained leave
  and was off on the much-broken and precarious railway on June 22.</p>

  <p>That journey was certainly the strangest railway journey of my life. From
  minute to minute one never knew what would happen. I was in the good company
  of Major Hanbury Williams, Lord Milner's Secretary, who allowed me to share
  his special carriage, and we had with us a little alert man named Amery, then
  unknown to fame, but now deservedly in the seats of the mighty. There were
  others but I have forgotten them. When the train stopped in the middle of the
  veldt, which it continually did, one never knew whether it was for five
  minutes or for five hours, as did actually occur, and as it went on again
  without warning one had to sit tight. We met a down train with its windows
  shattered and heard that twenty folk had been injured in a Boer ambuscade.
  Every hour we expected to be attacked. Once during one of our long halts we
  saw a horseman come cantering over the great green expanse. We got out to see
  and interview him. He was a tall, slab-sided fellow, unarmed, but with a
  rakish debonnaire look to him. He said he was a loyal British farmer, but I
  had no doubt in my own mind that he was a Boer scout who wanted to see what
  our train was carrying. He sat easy in his saddle for some little time,
  chatting with us, and then suddenly wheeled his grey horse round and galloped
  away. Some way further down the line we saw a farm burning, and a fringe of
  our irregulars riding round it. I was told that it was one of De Wet's farms
  and that it was a punishment for cutting the line. The whole scene might have
  been the middle ages&mdash;say a company of Moss troopers on a raid over the
  English border.</p>

  <p>When we came to the place of the Roodeval disaster, where our Derbyshire
  militia had been sadly cut up by De Wet, the train had to stop, for the line
  was under repair, and we were able to go over the ground. The place was
  littered with shells for the heavy guns taken from some looted train. Then
  there were acres covered with charred or partly charred letters, blowing
  about in the wind, for De Wet had burned the mail bags&mdash;one of his less
  sportsmanlike actions. Napoleon went one better, however, on a certain
  occasion when he published an Intercepted British mail, which led to a
  British reprisal of the same sort, not at all conducive to the peace of
  families. I picked up one letter which fluttered up to me, and I read in
  rough handwriting, "I hope you have killed all them Boers by now," with many
  x (kisses) underneath. Among other things were some of the band instruments,
  across which De Wet had driven his heavy wagons.</p>

  <p>It gave me a strange thrill when I looked out early one morning at a
  deserted platform and saw the word Pretoria printed upon a board. Here we
  were at last at the very centre of all things. The Transvaal Hotel was open
  and for several days it was my head-quarters while I examined men and things.
  One of my first tasks was to see Lord Roberts, who desired to interview me on
  account of some sensational articles by Burdett-Coutts which had appeared in
  the London Press upon the state of the hospitals. Of course that state had in
  many cases, possibly in all, been awful, but the reason lay in the terrible
  and sudden emergency. Every one had done his best to meet it and had met it
  to a surprising degree, but cases of hardship were numerous all the same.
  This I explained to Lord Roberts&mdash;and also to the Royal Commission in
  London. As an unpaid independent volunteer my words may have had more weight
  than those of some far greater authority who was personally involved. I can
  see Roberts now as he sat behind a small desk in his room. His face looked
  red and engorged, but that was due no doubt to his life in the sun. He was
  urbane and alert, reminding me at once of our former meeting in London. His
  light blue eyes were full of intelligence and kindness, but they had the
  watery look of age. Indeed, I can hardly remember in all military history a
  case where a man over seventy had been called out from retirement to conduct
  so arduous a campaign, and it was his conception of the fine flank march to
  Paardeburg which had actually beaten the Boers, however long they might keep
  up appearances of resistance. We had a short vivid talk and I never saw him
  again until he came to my own house at Hindhead to inspect my rifle range in
  1902.</p>

  <p>Of Lord Kitchener I saw nothing at Pretoria, but on one occasion a big man
  on a huge bay horse went past me at a hand gallop on the veldt, and as he
  passed he waved his hand, and I knew it was the famous soldier. He had been
  under a cloud since Paardeburg, and indeed it is hard to see how his tactics
  can be justified, since he attacked the Boers and lost some 2,000 men, when
  they were headed off and were bound to surrender in any case. There may be
  reasons unknown to a civilian, but I have heard soldiers speak warmly about
  it, for some of the attackers were mounted troops who had to gallop to the
  edge of the donga, and could do nothing when they got there. Colonel Hannay
  actually registered some protest before obeying the orders in which he and
  many of his men met their death. However, it was to Kitchener that all men
  turned now when the organization of the lines of communication was the vital
  point, and that rather than actual battle was his forte. I have been told by
  some who have been in action with him that he became nervously restless and
  impatient in a fight, while Roberts, on the other hand, became cooler and
  more quiet the greater the danger grew. In organization, however, Kitchener
  was inhuman in his cool accuracy. "Regret to report great dynamite explosion.
  Forty Kaffirs killed," was the report of one officer. "Do you need more
  dynamite?" was the answering telegram from Lord Kitchener.</p>

  <p>There was a bench outside my hotel on which a group of old bearded
  burghers used to smoke their pipes every day. I went down and sat among them
  with my Boer pipe filled with the best Magaliesburg. I said nothing, so soon
  they began to make advances, speaking excellent English in rough guttural
  fashion. Botha was not far from the town, and it was notorious that spies
  took him out the news every night. These old fellows were clearly a
  collecting station, so I thought it would be useful to give them something to
  ponder. After conversational remarks one of them said: "Tell us, Mister, when
  are we to have peace?" They were under the impression that the whole British
  nation was longing for peace, and it was this which encouraged the
  resistance. "Oh," said I, "I hope not for a long time yet." They all looked
  at each other, and then the spokesman said: "Why do you say that, Mister?"
  "Well, it's this way," said I. "This country, you see, is going to be a
  British Colony. It would be very awkward for us to have a Colony which was
  full of dangerous men. We couldn't kill them then, could we? They would be
  fellow-citizens and under the law's protection, the same as we. Our only
  chance is to kill them now, and that's what we will do if we have the time."
  The old fellows all grunted and puffed furiously at their pipes, but they
  could find no answer. Possibly some version of the matter may have reached
  the point I was aiming at.</p>

  <p>Our longest excursion from Pretoria was to Water-val, whither Bennett
  Burleigh took me in his Cape cart. Once we got quite close to a Boer patrol,
  about a dozen horsemen. Burleigh could not believe that they were actually
  the enemy until I pointed out that several of the horses were white, which
  was hardly ever known in our service. He then examined them with his glass,
  and found I was right. They were clearly on some quest of their own, for they
  took no notice of us, though they could easily have cut us off. Our drive
  took us to the great prison camp where so many British and Colonial soldiers
  had a humiliating experience. The prisoners had only got free a week or two
  before, and the whole place, many acres in size, was covered with every sort
  of souvenir. I contented myself with a Boer carbine which had been broken by
  a British prisoner, a band triangle, a half-knitted sock, the knitting
  needles being made from the barbed wire, and a set of leg fetters from the
  camp gaol. A tunnel had been bored just before the general delivery by some
  captive Hussars. It was a wonderful work, considering that it was done
  chiefly with spoons, and it had just been finished when relief came. I
  descended into it, and was photographed by Burleigh as I emerged. I daresay
  many of my friends have copies of it still, with my inscription: "Getting out
  of a hole, like the British Empire."</p>

  <p>I spent a day in Johannesburg, walking its deserted streets and seeing its
  great mines now dead or at least in suspended animation. I descended one of
  the deep mines, the Robinson, but as the hoisting machinery was out of order,
  and we had to walk in darkness down hundreds (it seemed thousands) of
  slippery wooden steps, with buckets, which did the draining, clanking past
  one's ear, it was certainly an over-rated amusement. We got the usual tips as
  to which mines were going to boom&mdash;on all of which I acted, and all of
  which proved to be wrong.</p>

  <p>On July 4, after an uneventful journey, which proved in itself that our
  grip was tightening upon the country, I found myself back in the Langman
  Hospital again. Times were quiet there, though another of our poor orderlies
  had just died of erysipelas, which had broken out in the wards&mdash;not
  traumatic erysipelas, but a variety which came without apparent cause. I
  mention the fact because enteric had been so universal that there really
  seemed no other disease, and this was the only appearance of any other
  ailment. If the army had all been inoculated, this would, I think, have been
  absolutely the healthiest war on record. Of surgical cases we had few, but I
  remember one operation which is perhaps rather technical for discussion and
  yet stands out very clearly in my memory. It was performed upon the Dutch
  military attaché with the Boers, who was picked up wounded and paralyzed
  after some engagement. A shrapnel bullet had broken one of his cervical
  vertebrae, the bone pressed on the nerves, and they had ceased to function.
  Watson Cheyne of London was the operator. He had cut down on the bone with a
  free incision and was endeavouring with a strong forceps to raise the broken
  arch of bone, when an amazing thing happened. Out of the great crimson cleft
  there rose a column of clear water 2 feet high, feathering at the top like a
  little palm tree, which gradually dwindled until it was only a few inches
  long, and finally disappeared. I had, I confess, no idea what it was, and I
  think many of the assembled surgeons were as taken aback as I was. The
  mystery was explained by Charles Gibbs, my mentor in such matters, who said
  that the cerebrospinal fluid, which is usually a mere moistening round the
  cord, had been greatly stimulated and increased by the pressure of the broken
  bone. It had finally distended the whole sheath. The forceps had punctured a
  small hole in the sheath and then the fluid had been pressed through and shot
  into the air as I had seen it. Perhaps the release was too sudden, for the
  patient died shortly after he was removed from the table.</p>

  <p>Charles Gibbs is still in practice, and senior surgeon of Charing Cross
  Hospital, but he will forgive me if I remind him that his pupil did once
  score over him. One of my enteric patients was obviously dying and kept
  murmuring that he would like some solid food.</p>

  <p>Of course the first law in treating enteric is, or was, that diet must be
  fluid, as the intestine is ulcerated and puncture of it means death by
  peritonitis. I said to Gibbs: "Do you consider that this man is sure to die?"
  "He is certainly as bad as he can be," said Gibbs. "Well then," said I, "I
  propose to give him a solid meal." Gibbs shook his head and was shocked. "It
  is a great responsibility you take." "What's the odds," I asked, "if he has
  to die anyhow?" "Well, it's just the difference whether you kill him or the
  disease does." "Well, I'll take the chance," said I&mdash;and I did so. A
  year or so later I was attending a public meeting at Edinburgh when the
  following letter, which I copy from my book of curiosities was handed up to
  me.</p>

  <p class="letter">128, ROYAL ROAD,<br>
  KENNINGTON PARK,<br>
  LONDON, S.E.<br>
  <i>October</i> 1, 1900.<br>
  <br>
  SIR;&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  As one who was under your care at Bloemfontein in "Langman's Hospital" I hope
  you will forgive me in taking the liberty of wishing you success at
  Edinburgh. I am actuated in this not only by political principles but by the
  fact that I (and others) owe my life to your kindness and care. You may not
  remember me, Sir, but I can assure you the remembrance of you is written in
  my mind and can never be removed. Again wishing you success and hoping you
  will pardon this liberty,<br>
  <br>
  I remain, Sir,<br>
  Yours obediently,<br>
  (Pte.) M. Hanlon, C.I.V.</p>

  <p>M. Hanlon was my enteric patient and he had never looked back from the day
  he had that square meal. But I don't say it was an example of the family
  practitioner to copy.</p>

  <p>On July 11 I went on board the <i>Briton</i> at Capetown and we sailed for
  England once more. I called upon Sir Alfred Milner before I left, and found
  him a very much older man than when only a few years before I had met him on
  the eve of his African experience. His hair was grizzled and his shoulders
  bowed, but his brave heart was as steadfast as ever, nor did it ever fail
  until his hard and thankless task was done. He made one error, I think, when
  he desired to keep South Africa under martial law when the war was over, but
  who could have done better, or as well, under the intolerable conditions
  which he had to face?</p>

  <p>It was a remarkable passenger list on the <i>Briton</i>, and a very joyous
  voyage. The Duke of Norfolk and his brother Lord Edward Talbot were two of
  the most cheery people on the ship. It was a weird sight to see the senior
  Baron of England and a lumpy Hollander sitting face to face on a spar, and
  slashing each other with bladders to see which could knock off the other.
  Blood told, if I remember right. Then there was Sir John Willoughby, of
  Jameson Raid fame, Lady Sarah Wilson from Mafeking, the Duke of Marlborough,
  Lady Arthur Grosvenor, the Hon. Ivor Guest and many famous soldiers.
  Especially was I fortunate in my friendship with Fletcher Robinson and with
  Nevinson, which was cemented by this closer association. Only one cloud
  marred the serenity of that golden voyage. There was a foreign officer on
  board, whose name I will not mention, who had been with the Boers and who
  talked with great indiscretion as to his experiences and opinions. He stated
  in my presence that the British had habitually used Dum-Dum bullets, on which
  I lost my temper and told him he was a liar. I must say that he behaved very
  well, for after thinking it over he saw that he was in the wrong and he sent
  dawn my friend Robinson to my cabin with a query as to whether I would accept
  an apology. I answered that I would not, since it was the army, and not me,
  which had been insulted. In an hour Robinson reappeared with the following
  letter, which ended what might have been a serious incident.</p>

  <p class="letter">DEAR SIR,&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  Allow me to tell you that I regret lively what I said about expanding
  bullets&mdash;which I said but after hear saying evidence I request you to
  let everybody know that I strongly wish on the contrary that I desire to be
  on best terms with every Englishman and beg you for that to be my
  interpreter.<br>
  <br>
  Yours very truly.</p>

  <p>The first days of August saw me in London once more, and soon all that
  strange episode&mdash;the green expanse of the veldt, the flat-topped hills,
  the enteric wards&mdash;had become the vision of a dream.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-19"
     id="ch-19"></a>XIX &mdash; AN APPEAL TO THE WORLD'S OPINION</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">Misrepresentation&mdash;Sudden Resolve&mdash;Reginald
  Smith&mdash;A Week's Hard Work&mdash;"The Cause and Conduct of the
  War"&mdash;Translations&mdash;German Letter&mdash;Complete
  Success&mdash;Surplus.</p><br>

  <p class="first">ONE of the most pleasing and complete episodes in my life
  was connected with the pamphlet which I wrote upon the methods and objects of
  our soldiers in South Africa. It was an attempt to stem the extraordinary
  outbreak of defamation which had broken out in every country&mdash;or nearly
  every country, in Europe, and which had attained such a height that it really
  seemed that on this absolutely fictitious basis might be built up a powerful
  political combination which would involve us in a serious war.</p>

  <p>I can well remember the inception of my enterprise! The date was January
  7, 1902. The day was a Tuesday. Sir Henry Thompson was holding that evening
  one of those charming "octave" dinners at which it was my occasional
  privilege to attend, and I was going up to town from Hindhead to keep the
  engagement. Sitting alone in a carriage I read the foreign correspondence of
  "The Times." In a single column there were accounts of meetings in all parts
  of Europe&mdash;notably one of some hundreds of Rhineland
  clergymen&mdash;protesting against our brutalities to our enemies. There
  followed a whole column of extracts from foreign papers, with grotesque
  descriptions of our barbarities. To any one who knew the easygoing British
  soldier or the character of his leaders the thing was unspeakably absurd; and
  yet, as I laid down the paper and thought the matter over, I could not but
  admit that these Continental people were acting under a generous and
  unselfish motive which was much to their credit. How could they help
  believing those things, and, believing them was it not their duty by meeting,
  by article, by any means, to denounce them? Could we accuse them of being
  credulous? Would we not be equally so if all our accounts of any transaction
  came from one side, and were supported by such journalists and, above all,
  such artists as lent their pens and pencils, whether venally or not, to the
  Boer cause? Of course we would. And whose fault was it that our side of the
  question was not equally laid before the jury of the civilized world? Perhaps
  we were too proud, perhaps we were too negligent&mdash;but the fact was
  obvious that judgment was being given against us by default. How <i>could</i>
  they know our case? Where could they find it? If I were asked what document
  they could consult, what could I answer? Blue-books and State papers are not
  for the multitude. There were books like Fitz-Patrick's "Transvaal from
  Within" or E. T. Cook's "Rights and Wrongs"; but these were expensive
  volumes, and not readily translated. Nowhere could be found a statement which
  covered the whole ground in a simple fashion. Why didn't some Briton draw it
  up? And then like a bullet through my head, came the thought, "Why don't you
  draw it up yourself?"</p>

  <p>The next instant I was on fire with the idea. Seldom in my life have I
  been so conscious of a direct imperative call which drove every other thought
  from the mind. If I were a humble advocate, it was all the better, since I
  could have no axe to grind. I was fairly well posted in the facts already, as
  I had written an interim history of the war. I had seen something of the
  campaign, and possessed many documents which bore upon the matter. My plans
  widened every instant. I would raise money from the public and by the sale of
  the book at home. With this I would translate it into every language.</p>

  <p>These translations should be given away wholesale. Every professor, every
  clergyman, every journalist, every politician, should have one put under his
  nose in his own language. In future, if they traduced us, they could no
  longer plead ignorance that there was another side to the question. Before I
  reached London all my programme was sketched out in my head. There was no
  item of it, I may add, which was not eventually carried through.</p>

  <p>Fortune was my friend. I have said that I was dining that night with Sir
  Henry Thompson. My neighbour at dinner was a gentleman whose name I had not
  caught. My mind being full of the one idea, my talk soon came round to it,
  and instead of my neighbour being bored, my remarks were received with a
  courteous and sympathetic attention which caused me to make even greater
  demands upon his patience. Having listened from the soup to the savoury
  (often has my conscience rebuked me since), he ended by asking me mildly how
  I proposed to raise the money for these wide-reaching schemes. I answered
  that I would appeal to the public. He asked me how much would suffice. I
  answered that I could make a start with £1,000 He remarked that it would take
  much more than that. "However," he added, "if £1,000 would go any way towards
  it, I have no doubt that sum could be got for you." "From whom?" I asked. He
  gave me his name and address and said: "I have no doubt that if you carry out
  the scheme on the lines you suggest, I could get the money. When you have
  done your work, come to me, and we will see how it is best to proceed." I
  promised to do so, and thanked him for his encouragement. Sir Eric Barrington
  of the Foreign Office was the name of this fairy godfather.</p>

  <p>This was my first stroke of good luck. A second came next morning. I had
  occasion to call upon the publishing house of Smith, Elder &amp; Co., over
  some other business, and during the interview I told Mr. Reginald Smith the
  plan that I had formed. Without a moment's hesitation he placed the whole
  machinery of his worldwide business at my disposal, without payment of any
  kind. From that moment he became my partner in the enterprise, and I found
  his counsel at every stage of as great help to me as the publishing services
  which he so generously rendered. Not only did he save heavy costs to the
  fund, but he arranged easily and successfully those complex foreign
  transactions which the scheme entailed.</p>

  <p>That morning I called at the War Office and was referred by them to the
  Intelligence Department, where every information which they possessed was
  freely put at my disposal. I then wrote to "The Times" explaining what I was
  trying to do, and asking those who sympathized with my object to lend me
  their aid. Never was an appeal more generously or rapidly answered. My
  morning post on the day after brought me 127 letters, nearly all of which
  contained sums drawn from every class of the community, varying from the £50
  of Lord Rosebery to the half-crown of the widow of a private soldier. Most of
  the remittances were accompanied by letters which showed that, however they
  might pretend in public to disregard it, the attitude of the foreign critics
  had really left a deep and bitter feeling in the hearts of our people.</p>

  <p>It was on January 9 that I was able to begin my task. On the 17th I had
  finished it. When the amount of matter is considered, and the number of
  researches and verifications which it entailed, I need not say that I had
  been absorbed in the work, and devoted, I dare say, sixteen hours a day to
  its accomplishment. So far as possible I kept my individual opinions in the
  background, and made a more effective case by marshalling the statements of
  eye-witnesses, many of them Boers, on the various questions of farm-burnings,
  outrages, concentration camps, and other contentious subjects. I made the
  comments as simple and as short as I could, while as to the accuracy of my
  facts, I may say that, save as to the exact number of farmhouses burned, I
  have never heard of one which has been seriously questioned. It was a glad
  day for me when I was able to lay down my pen with the feeling that my
  statement was as full and as effective as it was in me to make it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the subscriptions had still come steadily in, until nearly
  £1,000 more had been banked by the time that the booklet was finished. The
  greater number of contributions were in small sums from people who could ill
  afford it. One notable feature was the number of governesses and others
  residing abroad whose lives had been embittered by their inability to answer
  the slanders which were daily uttered in their presence. Many of these sent
  their small donations. A second pleasing feature was the number of foreigners
  resident in England who supported my scheme, in the hope that it would aid
  their own people to form a juster view. From Norwegians alone I received
  nearly £50 with this object. If Britain's own children too often betrayed her
  at a crisis of her fate, she found at least warm friends among the strangers
  within her gates. Another point worth noting was that a disproportionate sum
  was from clergymen, which was explained by several of them as due to the fact
  that since the war began they had been pestered by anti-national literature,
  and took this means of protesting against it.</p>

  <p>The proofs having been printed, I sent them to my Foreign Office friend as
  I had promised, and presently received an invitation to see him. He expressed
  his approval of the work, and handed me a banknote for £500, at the same time
  explaining that the money did not come from him. I asked if I might
  acknowledge it as from an anonymous donor&mdash;"The donor would not object,"
  said my friend. So I was able to head my list with "A Loyal Briton," who
  contributed £500. I daresay the Secret Service knew best whence the money
  came.</p>

  <p>By this time the banking account had risen to some two thousand pounds,
  and we were in a position to put our foreign translations in hand. The
  British edition had in the meantime been published, the distribution being
  placed in the hands of Messrs. Newnes, who gave the enterprise whole-hearted
  aid. The book was retailed at sixpence, but as it was our desire that the
  sale should be pushed it was sold to the trade at about threepence. The
  result was to leave the main profit of the enterprise in the hands of the
  retailer. The sale of the pamphlet was very large&mdash;in fact, I should
  imagine that it approached a record in the time. Some 250,000 copies were
  sold in Great Britain very quickly, and about 300,000 within a couple of
  months. This great sale enabled us to add considerably to the fund by the
  accumulation of the small rebate which had been reserved upon each copy. Our
  financial position was very strong, therefore, in dealing with the foreign
  translations.</p>

  <p>The French edition was prepared by Professor Sumichrast of Harvard
  University, who was a French-Canadian by birth. This gentleman patriotically
  refused to take any payment for his work, which was admirably done. It was
  published without difficulty by Galignani, and several thousands were given
  away where they would do most good, in France, Belgium, and Switzerland.
  Twenty thousand copies of this edition were printed.</p>

  <p>The German edition was a more difficult matter. No German publisher would
  undertake it, and the only courtesy which we met with in that country was
  from Baron von Tauchnitz, who included the volume in his well-known English
  library. Our advances were met with coldness, and occasionally with insult.
  Here, for example, is a copy of an extreme specimen of the kind of letter
  received.</p>

  <p class="letter"><i>January</i>, 1902.<br>
  <br>
  MESSRS. SMITH, ELDER &amp; CO.,&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  GENT,&mdash;Doyle's book makes the impression as if it was ordered or
  influenced by the English Jingo party.<br>
  <br>
  Now, you know, this English war party (as well as the English officers and
  soldiers in Transvaal) are contempted by the whole civilised world as coward
  scoundrels and vile brutes who murder women and children.<br>
  <br>
  It would be for me, as an importer of English literature to Germany, Austria
  and Russia, in the highest degree imprudent to do anything that could awake
  the suspicion I was in connection with so despised a party.<br>
  <br>
  I have shown your letter to several persons. Nobody was inclined to take up
  the matter.</p>

  <p>There is a mixture of venom and smugness about this epistle which gives it
  a high place in my collection. In spite of rebuffs, however, I found an
  Anglo-German publishing house in Berlin to undertake the work, and with the
  assistance of Herr Curt von Musgrave, who gave me an excellent translation, I
  was able to work off more than one very large edition, which had a
  perceptible effect in modifying the tone of that portion of the German press
  which was open to reason. Altogether 20,000 copies were distributed in the
  Fatherland and German-speaking Austria.</p>

  <p>I remember one whimsical incident at this time. Somewhat tired, after the
  book was in the press, I went down to Seaford for a rest. While there, a
  message reached me that a Pan-German officer of Landwehr had come over to
  London, and desired to see me. I wired that I could not come up, but that I
  should be happy to see him if he came down. Down he came accordingly, a fine,
  upstanding, soldierly man, speaking excellent English. The German proofs had
  passed through his hands, and he was much distressed by the way in which I
  had spoken of the hostility which his countrymen had shown us, and its effect
  upon our feelings towards them. We sat all day and argued the question out.
  His great point, as a Pan-German, was that some day both Germany and Britain
  would have to fight Russia&mdash;Britain for India, and Germany perhaps for
  the Baltic Provinces. Therefore they should keep in close touch with each
  other. I assured him that at the time the feeling in this country was much
  more bitter against Germany than against Russia. He doubted it. I suggested
  as a test that he should try the question upon any 'bus driver in London as a
  fair index of popular opinion. He was very anxious that I should modify
  certain paragraphs, and I was equally determined not to do so, as I was
  convinced they were true. Finally, when he left me on his return to London he
  said, "Well, I have come 800 miles to see you, and I ask you now as a final
  request that in the translation you will allow the one word 'Leider' ('Alas
  ') to be put at the opening of that paragraph." I was perfectly ready to
  agree to this, So he got one word in exchange for 1,600 miles of travel, and
  I think it was a very sporting venture.</p>

  <p>One charming incident connected with this German translation was that a
  small group of Swiss (and in no country had we such warm-hearted friends as
  among the minority in Switzerland) were so keen upon the cause that they had
  a translation and an edition of their own, with large print and maps. It was
  published independently at Zurich, Dr. Angst, the British Consul in that
  town, helping to organize it. Amongst other good friends who worked hard for
  the truth, and exposed themselves to much obloquy in doing so, were Professor
  Naville, the eminent Egyptologist of Geneva, and Monsieur Talichet, the
  well-known editor of the "Bibliothèque Universelle" of Lausanne, who
  sacrificed the circulation of his old-established magazine in upholding our
  cause.</p>

  <p>So much for the French and German editions. The American and Canadian had
  arranged themselves. There remained the Spanish, Portuguese, Italian,
  Hungarian, and Russian, all of which were rapidly prepared and circulated
  without a hitch, save that in the case of the Russian, which was published at
  Odessa, the Censor suppressed it at the last instant. We were successful,
  however, in getting his veto removed. In each of these countries several
  thousands of the booklet were given away. In every case we found a larger
  sale for these foreign editions than we expected, arising no doubt from the
  eagerness of English residents abroad to make their neighbours understand our
  position.</p>

  <p>The Dutch edition was a stumbling-block. This gallant little nation felt a
  most natural sympathy for their kinsfolk in arms against us, and honestly
  believed that they had been very badly used. We should certainly have felt
  the same. The result was that we were entirely unable to find either
  publisher or distributer. The greater the opposition the more obvious was the
  need for the book, so Mr. Reginald Smith arranged that a large edition should
  be printed here, and sent direct to all leaders of Dutch opinion. I believe
  that out of some 5,000 copies not more than twenty were sent back to us.</p>

  <p>The Norwegian edition also presented some difficulties which were overcome
  by the assistance of Mr. Thomassen of the "Verdensgang." This gentleman's
  paper was entirely opposed to us, but in the interests of fair play he helped
  me to get my book before the public. I hope that some relaxation in his
  attitude towards us in his paper may have been due to a fuller comprehension
  of our case, and a realization of the fact that a nation does not make great
  sacrifices extending over years for an ignoble cause. One other incident in
  connection with the Norwegian edition is pleasant for me to recall. I had
  prefaced each Continental version with a special foreword, designed to arrest
  the attention of the particular people whom I was addressing. In this case,
  when the book was going to press in Christiania, the preface had not arrived
  from the translator (the accomplished Madame Brockmann), and as she lived a
  hundred miles off, with all the passes blocked by a phenomenal snow-storm, it
  looked as if it must be omitted. Finally, however, my short address to the
  Scandinavian people was heliographed across from snow-peak to snow-peak, and
  so found its way to the book.</p>

  <p>There was one other language into which the book needed to be translated,
  and that was the Welsh, for the vernacular press of the Principality was
  almost entirely pro-Boer, and the Welsh people had the most distorted
  information as to the cause for which their fellow-countrymen fought so
  bravely in the field. The translation was done by Mr. W. Evans, and some
  10,000 copies were printed for distribution through the agency of the Cardiff
  "Western Mail." This finished our labours. Our total output was 300,000 of
  the British edition, about 50,000 in Canada and the United States, 20,000 in
  Germany, 20,000 in France, 5,000 in Holland, 10,000 in Wales, 8,000 in
  Hungary, 5,000 in Norway and Sweden, 3,500 in Portugal, 10,000 in Spain,
  5,000 in Italy, and 5,000 in Russia. There were editions in Tamil and
  Kanarese, the numbers of which I do not know. In all, I have seen twenty
  different presentments of my little book. The total sum at our disposal
  amounted to about £5,000, of which, speaking roughly, half came from
  subscriptions and the other half was earned by the book itself.</p>

  <p>It was not long before we had the most gratifying evidence of the success
  of these efforts. There was a rapid and marked change in the tone of the
  whole Continental press, which may have been a coincidence, but was certainly
  a pleasing one. In the case of many important organs of public opinion there
  could, however, be no question of coincidence, as the arguments advanced in
  the booklet and the facts quoted were cited in their leading articles as
  having modified their former anti-British views. This was the case with the
  "Tagblatt" of Vienna, whose London representative, Dr. Maurice Ernst, helped
  me in every way to approach the Austrian public. So it was also with the
  "National Zeitung" in Berlin, the "Indépendance Belge" in Brussels, and many
  others. In the greater number of cases, however, it was unreasonable to
  suppose that a journal would publicly eat its own words, and the best result
  for which we could hope was that which we often attained, an altered and less
  acrimonious tone.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reginald Smith and I now found ourselves in the very pleasant position
  of having accomplished our work so far as we could do it, and yet of having
  in hand a considerable sum of money. What were we to do with it? To return it
  to subscribers was impossible, and indeed at least half of it would have to
  be returned to ourselves since it had been earned by the sale of the book. I
  felt that the subscribers had given me a free hand with the money, to use it
  to the best of my judgment for national aims.</p>

  <p>Our first expense was in immediate connection with the object in view, for
  we endeavoured to supplement the effect of the booklet by circulating a large
  number of an excellent Austrian work, "Recht and Unrecht im Burenkrieg," by
  Dr. Ferdinand Hirz. Six hundred of these were distributed where they might do
  most good.</p>

  <p>Our next move was to purchase half a dozen very handsome gold cigarette
  cases. On the back of each was engraved, "From Friends in England to a Friend
  of England." These were distributed to a few of those who had stood most
  staunchly by us. One went to the eminent French publicist, Monsieur Yves
  Guyot, a second to Monsieur Talichet of Lausanne, a third to Mr. Sumichrast,
  and a fourth to Professor Naville. By a happy coincidence the latter
  gentleman happened to be in this country at the time, and I had the pleasure
  of slipping the small souvenir into his hand as he put on his overcoat in the
  hall of the Athenaeum Club. I have seldom seen anyone look more
  surprised.</p>

  <p>There remained a considerable sum, and Mr. Reginald Smith shared my
  opinion that we should find some permanent use for it, and that this use
  should bring benefit to natives of South Africa. We therefore forwarded
  £1,000 to Edinburgh University, to be so invested as to give a return of £40
  a year, which should be devoted to the South African student who acquitted
  himself with most distinction. There are many Afrikander students at
  Edinburgh, and we imagined that we had hit upon a pleasing common interest
  for Boer and for Briton; but I confess that I was rather amazed when at the
  end of the first year I received a letter from a student expressing his
  confidence that he would win the bursary, and adding that there could be no
  question as to his eligibility, as he was a full-blooded Zulu.</p>

  <p>The fund, however, was by no means exhausted, and we were able to make
  contributions to the Civilian Rifleman's movement, to the Union Jack Club, to
  the Indian famine, to the Japanese nursing, to the Irish old soldiers'
  institute, to the fund for distressed Boers, and to many other deserving
  objects. These donations varied from fifty guineas to ten. Finally we were
  left with a residuum which amounted to £309 Os. 4d. Mr. Reginald Smith and I
  sat in solemn conclave over this sum, and discussed how it might best be used
  for the needs of the Empire. The fourpence presented no difficulty, for we
  worked it off upon the crossing sweeper outside, who had helped to relieve
  Delhi. Nine pounds went in tobacco for the Chelsea veterans at Christmas.
  There remained the good round sum of £300. We bethought us of the saying that
  the safety of the Empire might depend upon a single shot from a twelve-inch
  gun, and we devoted the whole amount to a magnificent cup, to be shot for by
  the various ships of the Channel Squadron, the winner to hold it for a single
  year. The stand of the cup was from the oak timbers of the <i>Victory</i>,
  and the trophy itself was a splendid one in solid silver gilt. By the kind
  and judicious co-operation of Admiral Sir Percy Scott, the Inspector of
  Target Practice, through whose hands the trophy passed to the Senior Admiral
  afloat, Sir Arthur Wilson, V.C., in command of the Channel Squadron, all
  difficulties were overcome and the cup was shot for that year, and has since
  produced, I am told, great emulation among the various crews. Our one
  condition was that it should not be retained in the mess-room, but should be
  put out on the deck where the winning bluejackets could continually see it. I
  learn that the "Exmouth" came into Plymouth Harbour with the cup on the top
  of her fore turret.</p>

  <p>The one abiding impression left upon my mind by the whole episode is that
  our Government does not use publicity enough in stating and defending its own
  case. If a private individual could by spending £3,000 and putting in a
  month's work make a marked impression upon the public opinion of the world,
  what could be done by a really rich and intelligent organization? But the
  first requisite is that you should honestly have a just cause to state. Who
  is there outside England who really knows the repeated and honest efforts
  made by us to settle the eternal Irish question and hold the scales fair
  between rival Irishmen? We certainly do, as a great Frenchman said, "defend
  ourselves very badly." If we let cases go by default how can we imagine that
  the verdict can be in our favour?</p>

     id="ch-20"></a>XX &mdash; MY POLITICAL ADVENTURES</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">Central Edinburgh&mdash;A Knock-out&mdash;The Border
  Burghs&mdash;Tariff Reform&mdash;Heckling&mdash;Interpolations&mdash;Defeat&mdash;Reflections.</p><br>

  <p class="first">I HAVE twice stood for Parliament, though if anyone were to
  ask me my real reasons for doing so I should find it difficult to give them
  an intelligible answer. It certainly was from no burning desire to join that
  august assembly, for in each case I deliberately contested seats which every
  expert considered to be impossible, and though on one occasion I very nearly
  proved the experts to be wrong, my action is none the less a sign that I had
  no great wish to be at the head of the poll, for other and easier seats had
  been offered me. In the case of Central Edinburgh, for which I stood in the
  1900 election, there may have been some sentimental call, for it was the
  section of the city where I was educated and where much of my boyhood was
  spent. It was said to be the premier Radical stronghold of Scotland, and to
  carry it would be a fine exploit, for though I was a good deal of a Radical
  myself in many ways, I knew that it would be a national disgrace and possibly
  an imperial disaster if we did not carry the Boer War to complete success,
  and that was the real issue before the electors.</p>

  <p>I believe that Providence one way or another gets a man's full powers out
  of him, but that it is essential that the man himself should co-operate to
  the extent of putting himself in the way of achievement. Give yourself the
  chance always. If it is so fated, you will win through. If your path lies
  elsewhere, then you have got your sign through your failure. But do not put
  yourself in the position later in life of looking back and saying, "Perhaps I
  might have had a career there had I tried." Deep in my bones I felt that I
  was on earth for some big purpose, and it was only by trying that I could
  tell that the purpose was not political, though I could never imagine myself
  as fettered to a party or as thinking that all virtues lay with one set of
  men.</p>

  <p>My political work was not wasted. I stood in the two most heckling
  constituencies in Scotland, and through that odious and much-abused custom I
  gained a coolness on the platform and a disregard for interruption and
  clamour, which have stood me in good stead since. Indeed, I hold that it was
  to fashion me more perfectly for my ultimate work that I was twice passed
  through this furnace. I remember that once at Hawick my soldier brother came
  to see how I was getting on, and was struck by the effect which I had upon my
  audience. "It would be strange, Arthur," said he, "if your real career should
  prove to be political and not literary." "It will be neither. It will be
  religious," said I. Then we looked at each other in surprise and both burst
  out laughing. The answer seemed quite absurd and pointless, for no remote
  possibility of such a thing suggested itself. It was a curious example of
  that unconscious power of prophecy which is latent within us.</p>

  <p>I had hardly landed from South Africa when I flung myself into the
  Edinburgh contest. Mr. Cranston, later Sir Robert Cranston, a well-known
  citizen, was my chairman. When I arrived a small meeting was held, and I, a
  weary man, listened while it was gravely debated, with much weighing of pros
  and cons, what my view was to be on each of the vital questions. Finally it
  was all settled to their satisfaction and written down, preparatory to
  forming the election address. I had listened with some amusement, and when it
  was all over I said: "Gentlemen, may I ask who is going to honour these
  promises that you are making?" "Why, you, of course," said they. "Then I
  think it would be better if I made them," said I, and, crumpling up their
  document, I picked up a pen and wrote out my own views and my own address. It
  was well received and would have won the election against enormous
  odds&mdash;some thousands of votes at the last trial&mdash;were it not for a
  very unexpected intervention.</p>

  <p>Those who remember the election will bear me out that it was an exciting
  affair. My opponent was a Mr. Brown, a member of Nelson's publishing firm,
  which had large works in the constituency. I was fresh from the scene of war
  and overflowing with zeal to help the army, so I spared myself in no way. I
  spoke from barrels in the street or any other pedestal I could find, holding
  many wayside meetings besides my big meetings in the evening, which were
  always crowded and uproarious. There was nothing which I could have done and
  did not do. My opponent was not formidable, but I had against me an
  overwhelming party machine with its registered lists, and record of unbroken
  victory. It was no light matter to change the vote of a Scotsman, and many of
  them would as soon think of changing their religion. One serious mischance
  occurred. I was determined to do and say nothing which I did not heartily
  mean, and this united Ireland, North and South, for the first time in
  history. The Irish vote was considerable, so that this was important. The
  South quarrelled with me because, though I favoured some devolution, I was
  not yet converted to Home Rule. The North was angry because I was in favour
  of a Catholic University for Dublin. So I had no votes from Ireland. When I
  went down to hold a meeting in a hall in the Cowgate, which is the Irish
  quarter, I was told that it had been arranged to break my platform up. This
  seems to have been true, but fortunately I got on good human terms with my
  audience, and indeed moved some of them to tears, by telling them of the
  meeting between the two battalions of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers at
  Ladysmith. So it happened that when a sinister-looking figure, a local
  horse-slaughterer, appeared on the edge of the stage, he was received in
  silence. He moved slowly across and said something about free speech. I felt
  that if I or my people were violent there would be a riot, so I simply said:
  "Trot along, sonny, trot along!" He did trot along and disappeared on the
  other side of the stage. After the transit of this sinister star, and my
  temporary eclipse, all went well to the end.</p>

  <p>As the day of the election approached, it became more and more evident
  that I was getting dangerous, but I was knocked out&mdash;fortunately for
  myself, as I now discern&mdash;by a curious interference. There was an
  Evangelical fanatic named Plimmer living at Dunfermline who thought it his
  special mission in life to keep Roman Catholic candidates out of Parliament.
  Therefore at the eleventh hour, the very night before the voting, the whole
  district was placarded with big sheets to say that I was a Roman Catholic,
  that I had been educated by Jesuits, and in fact that my whole candidature
  was an attack upon Kirk and Covenant and Lesser Catechism and everything dear
  to the Scottish heart. It was very cleverly done, and of course this fanatic
  alone could not have paid the expenses, though I cannot believe that Mr.
  Brown knew anything of the matter. My unhappy supporters saw crowds of
  workmen reading these absurd placards and calling out, "I've done with him!"
  As it was I very narrowly missed the seat, being only beaten by a few hundred
  votes. The question of an appeal came along, but the thing was so clever that
  it really was difficult to handle, since it was true enough that I had been
  educated by Jesuits and yet absurdly untrue that this education influenced my
  present frame of mind. Therefore we had to leave it alone.</p>

  <p>Looking back, I am inclined to look upon Mr. Plimmer as one of the great
  benefactors of my life. He altered the points at the last moment and
  prevented me from being shunted on to a side-line which would perhaps have
  taken me to a dead end. I could never have been a party man, and there seems
  no place under our system for anyone else. At the moment I was a little sore,
  and I wrote a letter to the "Scotsman" which defined my religious position as
  it was then, and caused, I believe, no little comment. I had the following
  letter from Sir John Boraston, who was the party organizer. The first
  sentence refers to the possibility of lodging a legal protest.</p>

  <p class="letter">6 GREAT GEORGE STREET,<br>
  WESTMINSTER,<br>
  LONDON, S.W.<br>
  <i>October</i> 18, 1900.<br>
  <br>
  DEAR DR. DOYLE,&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  Probably your Edinburgh advisers are right, but it is undoubtedly a
  misfortune that the perpetrators of attacks such as that which was made upon
  you should be allowed to go unpunished.<br>
  <br>
  Your fight was indeed a phenomenal one, and you have the consolation of
  knowing that if you did not actually win a seat for yourself, you did
  materially contribute to the Liberal Unionist victories in two other
  Edinburgh constituencies&mdash;this is generally admitted.<br>
  <br>
  I am sure you will feel that your first entry into active political life
  promises a full measure of success at no distant date, and I hope I may see
  you again before long to talk matters over.<br>
  <br>
  Yours very truly,<br>
  (<i>Sgd</i>.) JOHN BORASTON.</p>

  <p>I had no further urge to try political adventures, but when the Tariff
  Reform election of 1905 came round I felt that I should make some sacrifice
  for the faith that was in me. Mr. "Tommy" Shaw, as he was called&mdash;now
  Lord Shaw&mdash;was one of the most energetic Radicals in Scotland, and was
  reputed to be most firmly established in his seat, which was called "The
  Border Burghs," consisting of the small towns of Hawick, Galashiels and
  Selkirk, all of them engaged in the woollen trade, and all of them hard hit
  by German competition. It seemed to me that if there was a good field
  anywhere for Mr. Joseph Chamberlain's views on a protective tariff it should
  be there, where an open market had caused such distress and loss. My
  reasoning was sound enough, but I had not reckoned upon the innate
  conservatism of the Scottish character, which cannot readjust its general
  principles to meet the particular case&mdash;a noble trait, but occasionally
  an unpractical one. Party politics are not a divine law, but simply a means
  to an end, which must adjust itself as the end varies.</p>

  <p>This time I really expended a good deal of work as well as money upon the
  attempt, for if you stand for others besides yourself you have no choice but
  to work up to the last pound of steam. I might have added my neck to the
  other things which I risked, for in an endeavour to get into comradeship with
  the people I joined in what is known as the "common-riding" at Hawick, where
  a general holiday is proclaimed while the bounds of the common are ridden
  over and defined. Part of the proceedings was that each mounted man had to
  gallop full-split down the high road over a measured course of half a mile or
  so, the burghers lining the way and helping one by waving sticks and
  umbrellas. I was mounted on a hunter which I had never seen before, and which
  was full of spirit. Fortunately this monstrous road performance came off late
  in the afternoon, and I had taken some of the spirit out of him by our ride
  round the common. I do not profess to be a great horseman, and I certainly
  nearly made the acquaintance of the Hawick turnpike. Sooner or later some one
  will be killed at that game, and horses must be lamed every year. Afterwards
  an interminable ballad was recited with a sort of jingling chorus to which
  all who are near the reciter keep time with their feet. As it would seem
  unsympathetic not to join in, I also kept time with the rhythm, and was
  amused and amazed when I got back to London to see in the papers that I had
  danced a hornpipe in public before the electors. Altogether I had no desire
  to face another Hawick common-riding.</p>

  <p>The trouble in dealing with a three-town constituency, each town very
  jealous of the others, is that whatever you do has to be done thrice or you
  give offence. I was therefore heartily sick of the preparation and only too
  pleased when the actual election came off. I thought then, and I think now,
  that a sliding tariff, if only as an instrument for bargaining, would be
  altogether to our interest in this country, and would possibly cause some of
  our rivals to cease closing their markets to us, while they freely use the
  open market which we present. I still think that Chamberlain's whole scheme
  was an admirable one, and that it was defeated by a campaign of
  misrepresentation and actual lying, in which Chinese labour and dear food
  played a chief part. I stood among the ruins of a dismantled factory in the
  Border Burghs and I showed how it had been destroyed by German competition,
  and how while we let their goods in free they were levying taxes on ours and
  spending the money so gained upon warships with which we might some day have
  to reckon. The answer to my arguments consisted largely of coloured cartoons
  of Chinamen working in chains in the mines of the Transvaal, and other
  nonsense of the sort. I worked very hard; so hard that on the last night of
  the election I addressed meetings in each of the three towns, which, as they
  are separated by many miles of hilly roads, is a feat never done, I
  understand, before or since. However, it was of no avail and I was beaten,
  though I believe I am right in saying that the party showed a less decrease
  of votes than in any constituency in Scotland. The thing which annoyed me
  most about the election was that my opponent, Tommy Shaw, only appeared once,
  so far as I remember, in the constituency, and did everything by deputy, so
  that I found myself like a boxer who is punching his rival's second instead
  of himself all the time. I had the melancholy satisfaction of noting that the
  Radical chairman who was so engrossed in the wrongs of Chinamen in the
  Transvaal went into liquidation within a few months, giving as his reason the
  pressure of foreign competition in the woollen trade.</p>

  <p>It is a vile business this electioneering, though no doubt it is
  chastening in its effects. They say that mud-baths are healthy and purifying,
  and I can compare it to nothing else. This applies particularly, I think, to
  Scotland, where the art of heckling has been carried to extremes. This asking
  of questions was an excellent thing so long as it was honest in its desire to
  know the candidate's opinion upon a public measure. But the honest questions
  are the exception and the unfortunate man is baited by all sorts of senseless
  trick questions from mischievous and irresponsible persons, which are
  designed to annoy him and make him seem foolish or ignorant. Some reform is
  badly needed in this matter. Often, after a speech of an hour, I had an hour
  of questions, one more absurd than another. The press records wilt show, I
  hope, that I held my own, for I knew my subject well, and by this time I had
  had a good schooling on the platform. Sometimes I countered heavily. I
  remember one robust individual coming down with a carefully prepared question
  which he shouted from the back of the hall. I had been speaking of
  retaliation in commercial tariffs, and his question was: "Mister Candidate,
  how do you reconcile retaliation with the Sermon on the Mount?" I answered:
  "We cannot in life always reach the highest ideals. Have <i>you</i> sold all
  and given to the poor?" The man was locally famous as having done nothing of
  the sort, and there was a howl of delight at my answer which fairly drove him
  out of the hall.</p>

  <p>There is a peculiar dry Scottish wit which is very effective when you get
  it on your side. I remember one solemn person who had a loaf on the end of a
  pole which he protruded towards me, as if it were a death's-head, from the
  side box of the theatre in which I spoke. The implication was, I suppose,
  that I would raise the price of bread. It was difficult to ignore the thing
  and yet puzzling how to meet it, but one of my people in broad Doric cried:
  "Tak' it hame and eat it!" which quite spoilt the effect. Usually these
  interpolations are delivered in a dreamy impersonal sort of voice. When, in
  talking of the Transvaal War, I said with some passion, "Who is going to pay
  for this war?" a seedy-looking person standing against the side wall said,
  "I'm no' carin'!" which made both me and the audience laugh. Again I remember
  my speech being quite interrupted by a joke which was lost upon me. I had
  spoken of the self-respect and decent attire of American factory hands. "Gang
  and look at Broon's," said the dreamy voice. I have never yet learned whether
  Brown's factory was famous for tidiness or the reverse, but the remark
  convulsed the audience.</p>

  <p>The Radicals used to attend my meetings in great numbers, so that really,
  I think, they were often hostile audiences which I addressed. Since their own
  candidate held hardly any meetings I was the only fun to be had. Before the
  meeting the packed house would indulge in cries and counter-cries with rival
  songs and slogans, so that as I approached the building it sounded like
  feeding-time at the Zoo. My heart often sank within me as I listened to the
  uproar, and I would ask myself what on earth I meant by placing myself in
  such a position. Once on the platform, however, my fighting blood warmed up,
  and I did not quail before any clamour. It was all a great education for the
  future, though I did not realize it at the time, but followed blindly where
  some strange inward instinct led me on. What tired me most was the personal
  liberties taken by vulgar people, which is a very different thing from poor
  people, whom I usually find to be very delicate in their feelings. I take a
  liberty with no man, and there is something in me which rises up in anger if
  any man takes a liberty with me. A candidate cannot say all he thinks on this
  matter, or his party may suffer. I was always on my guard lest I should give
  offence in this way, and I well remember how on one occasion I stood during a
  three days' campaign a good many indignities with exemplary patience. I was
  on edge, however, and, as luck would have it, at the very last moment, as I
  stood on the platform waiting for the London train, one of my own people, an
  exuberant young bounder, came up with a loud familiar greeting and squeezed
  my right hand until my signet ring nearly cut me. It opened the sluice and
  out came a torrent of whaler language which I had hoped that I had long ago
  forgotten. The blast seemed to blow him bodily across the platform, and
  formed a strange farewell to my supporters.</p>

  <p>Thus ended my career in politics. I could say with my friend Kendrick
  Bangs: "The electors have returned me&mdash;to the bosom of my family." A
  very pleasant constituency it is. I had now thoroughly explored that path,
  and had assured myself that my life's journey did not lie along it. And yet I
  was deeply convinced that public service was waiting for me somewhere. One
  likes to feel that one has some small practical influence upon the affairs of
  one's time, but I encourage myself by the thought that though I have not been
  a public man, yet my utterances in several pamphlets and numerous letters in
  the Press may have had more weight with the public since I was disassociated
  from any political interest which could sway my judgment.</p>

  <p class="chaphead">"History of the War"&mdash;Sir Oliver
  Lodge&mdash;Military Arguments&mdash;"Sir Nigel"&mdash;The Edalji
  Case&mdash;Crowborough&mdash;The Oscar Slater Case.</p><br>

  <p class="first">WHEN I returned from South Africa, I found that my wife had
  improved in health during her stay at Naples, and we were able to settle down
  once more at Hindhead, where, what with work, cricket, and hunting, I had
  some pleasant years. A few pressing tasks were awaiting me, however. Besides
  the barren contest at Edinburgh I had done a history of the war, but the war
  still continued, and I had to modify it and keep it up to date in successive
  editions, until in 1902 it took final shape. I called it "The Great Boer
  War," not because I thought the war "great" in the scale of history, but to
  distinguish it from the smaller Boer War of 1881. It had the good fortune to
  please both friend and foe, for there was an article from one of the Boer
  leaders in "Cornhill" commending its impartial tone. It has been published
  now by Nelson in a cheap edition, and shows every sign of being the permanent
  record of the campaign. No less than £27,000 was spent upon an Official
  History, but I cannot find that there was anything in it which I had not
  already chronicled, save for those minute details of various forces which
  clog a narrative. I asked the chief official historian whether my book had
  been of use to him, and he very handsomely answered that it had been the
  spine round which he built.</p>

  <p>This history, which is a large-sized book, is not to be confused with the
  pamphlet "The Cause and Conduct of the War in South Africa," which was a
  small concise defence of the British position. The inception and result of
  this I have already described. I have no doubt that it was to the latter that
  my knighthood, and my appointment as Deputy-Lieutenant of Surrey, both of
  which occurred in 1902, were due.</p>

  <p>I remember that on going down to Buckingham Palace to receive the
  accolade, I found that all who were waiting for various honours were herded
  into funny little pens, according to their style and degree, there to await
  their turn. It chanced that Prof. Oliver Lodge, who was knighted on the same
  morning, was penned with me, and we plunged at once into psychic talk, which
  made me forget where I was, or what I was there for. Lodge was really more
  advanced and certain in his views than I was at that time, but I was quite
  sure about the truth of the phenomena, and only doubtful whether some
  alternative explanation might be found for a discarnate intelligence as the
  force at the back of them. This possibility I weighed for years before the
  evidence forced me to the Spiritist conclusion. But when, among the cloud of
  lies with which we are constantly girt, I read that Lodge and I were
  converted to our present views by the death of our respective sons, my mind
  goes back very clearly to that exchange of thought in 1902. At that time we
  had both studied the subject for many years.</p>

  <p>Among the many congratulations which I had on my knighthood there were few
  which I valued more highly than that of my old comrade, H. A. Gwynne, who
  knew so much about South African affairs. He was good enough to say: "I look
  upon your work during this terrible South African business as quite equal to
  that of a successful general." This may well be the exaggeration of
  friendship, but it is at least pleasing to know that those who were in a
  position to judge did not look upon me as a mere busybody who butts in
  without due cause.</p>

  <p>There is one incident at this period which comes back to my memory, and
  seems very whimsical. I had taken a course of muscular development with Mr.
  Sandow, the strong man, and in that way had formed an acquaintance with him.
  In the winter of 1901 Mr. Sandow had a laudable desire to do something for
  the British wounded, and with that idea he announced a competition at the
  Albert Hall. He was himself to show feats of strength and then there was to
  be a muster of strong men who should exhibit their proportions and receive
  prizes. There were to be three prizes, a golden statue about two feet high, a
  silver replica, and a bronze.</p>

  <p>Sandow asked Lawes the sculptor and myself to be the two judges, he being
  referee.</p>

  <p>It proved to be a very big event. The Albert Hall was crowded. There were
  eighty competitors, each of whom had to stand on a pedestal, arrayed only in
  a leopard's skin. Lawes and I put them up ten at a time, chose one here and
  one there, and so gradually reduced the number until we only had six left.
  Then it became excessively difficult, for they were all perfectly developed
  athletes. Finally the matter was simplified by three extra prizes, and then
  we got down to the three winners, but had still to name their order, which
  was all-important since the value of the three prizes was so very different.
  The three men were all wonderful specimens, but one was a little clumsy and
  another a little short, so we gave the valuable gold statue to the middle
  one, whose name was Murray, and who came from Lancashire. The vast audience
  was very patient during our long judgment, and showed that it was in general
  agreement. After the meeting Sandow had invited the prize-winners, the judges
  and a chosen company to a late supper, which was very sumptuous, with
  champagne flowing freely. When we had finished it was early in the morning.
  As I left the place of banquet I saw in front of me the winning athlete going
  forth into the London night with the big golden statue under his arm. I had
  seen that he was a very simple countryman, unused to London ways, so I
  overtook him and asked him what his plans were. He confided to me that he had
  no money, but he had a return ticket to Bolton or Blackburn, and his idea was
  to walk the streets until a train started for the North. It seemed to me a
  monstrous thing to allow him to wander about with his treasure at the mercy
  of any murderous gang, so I suggested that he should come back with me to
  Morley's Hotel, where I was residing. We could not get a cab, and it seemed
  to me more grotesque than anything of Stevenson's London imaginings, that I
  should be wandering round at three in the morning in the company of a
  stranger who bore a great golden statue of a nude figure in his arms. When at
  last we reached the hotel I told the night porter to get him a room, saying
  at the same time, "Mind you are civil to him, for he has just been declared
  to be the strongest man in England." This went round the hotel, and I found
  that in the morning he held quite a reception, all the maids and waiters
  paying homage while he lay in bed with his statue beside him. He asked my
  advice as to selling it, for it was of considerable value and seemed a white
  elephant to a poor man. I told him he should open a gymnasium in his native
  town and have the statue exhibited as an advertisement. This he did, and I
  believe he has been very successful.</p>

  <p>A post-African task was the building up of rifle clubs, for I was
  enormously impressed by the power of the rifle as shown in the recent war. A
  soldier was no longer a specialized creature, but every brave man who could
  hold a rifle-barrel straight was a dangerous man. I founded the Undershaw
  Club, which was the father of many others, and which was inspected by Lord
  Roberts, Mr. Seeley and other great men. Within a year or two England was
  dotted with village clubs, though I fear that few of them still hold their
  own.</p>

  <p>I was so struck by the factors in modern warfare and I had thought so much
  about them in Africa that I wrote about them with some freedom and possibly
  even with some bitterness, so that I speedily found myself involved in hot
  controversy with Colonel Lonsdale Hale, "The Times" expert, and also with
  Colonel Maude, a well-known military writer. Perhaps as a civilian I should
  have expressed my views in a more subdued way, but my feelings had been
  aroused by the conviction that the lives of our men, and even the honour of
  our country, had been jeopardized by the conservatism of the military and
  that it would so happen again unless more modern views prevailed. I continued
  to advance my theories for the next ten years, and I have no doubt, when I
  judge them by the experience of the Great War, that in the main I was right.
  The points which I made were roughly as follows:</p>

  <p>That the rifle (or machine-gun, which is a modified rifle) is the supreme
  arbiter in war, and that therefore everything must be sacrificed to
  concentrate upon that.</p>

  <p>That the only place for swords, lances and all the frippery of the past
  was a museum. Bayonets also are very questionable.</p>

  <p>That cavalry could not divide their allegiance between rifle and sword
  since entirely different ground and tactics are needed for each, the
  swordsman looking for level sward, the rifleman looking for cover. Therefore
  all cavalry should at once become Mounted Rifles.</p>

  <p>That the very heaviest guns of our fortresses or battleships would be
  transported by road and used in the field in our next campaign.</p>

  <p>That field guns must take cover exactly as riflemen do.</p>

  <p>That the Yeomanry, a very expensive force, should be turned into a Cyclist
  organization.</p>

  <p>In view of the fine work done by the Yeomanry, especially in the Eastern
  deserts, I should reconsider the last item, and the bayonet question is
  debatable, but all the rest will stand. I stressed the fact also that the
  period of military training is placed too high, and that an excellent army
  could be rapidly vamped up if you had the right men. This also was proved by
  the war.</p>

  <p>I remember a debate which I attended as to the proper arms and use of
  cavalry. The cavalry were there in force, all manner of gallant fellows,
  moustached and debonnaire, inclined to glare at those who would disarm them.
  Sir Taubman-Goldie was in the chair. Three of us, all civilians, upheld the
  unpopular view that they should lose all their glory and become sombre but
  deadly riflemen. It is curious now to record that the three men were Erskine
  Childers, Lionel Amery and myself. Childers was shot at dawn as a traitor to
  Ireland as well as to Britain, Amery became First Lord of the Admiralty, and
  I write this memoir. I remember Amery's amusing comparison when he twitted
  the cavalry with wishing to retain the <i>arme blanche</i> simply because
  their Continental antagonists would have it. "If you fight a rhinoceros," he
  said, "you don't want to tie a horn on your nose." It is an interesting
  commentary upon this discussion that on one morning during the war there were
  duels between two separate squadrons of British and German cavalry. The first
  two squadrons, who were Lancers, rode through each others' ranks twice with
  loss on either side and no conclusive result. In the second case German
  Lancers charged British Hussars, who dismounted, used their carbines, and
  simply annihilated the small force which attacked them.</p>

  <p>When my immediate preoccupations after the war had been got rid of, I
  settled down to attempt some literary work upon a larger and more ambitious
  scale than the Sherlock Holmes or Brigadier Gerard stories which had occupied
  so much of my time. The result was "Sir Nigel," in which I reverted to the
  spacious days of the "White Company," and used some of the same characters.
  "Sir Nigel" represents in my opinion my high-water mark in literature, and
  though that mark may be on sand, still an author knows its comparative
  position to the others. It received no particular recognition from critics or
  public, which was, I admit, a disappointment to me. In England versatility is
  looked upon with distrust. You may write ballad tunes or you may write grand
  opera, but it cannot be admitted that the same man may be master of the whole
  musical range and do either with equal success.</p>

  <p>In 1906 my wife passed away after the long illness which she had borne
  with such exemplary patience. Her end was painless and serene. The long fight
  had ended at last in defeat, but at least we had held the vital fort for
  thirteen years after every expert had said that it was untenable. For some
  time after these days of darkness I was unable to settle to work, until the
  Edalji case came suddenly to turn my energies into an entirely unexpected
  channel.</p>

  <p>It was in the year 1907 that this notorious case took up much of my time,
  but it was not wasted, as it ended, after much labour, in partially
  rectifying a very serious miscarriage of justice. The facts of the case are a
  little complex and became more so as the matter proceeded. George Edalji was
  a young law student, son of the Reverend S. Edalji, the Parsee Vicar of the
  parish of Great Wyrley, who had married an English lady. How the Vicar came
  to be a Parsee, or how a Parsee came to be the Vicar, I have no idea. Perhaps
  some Catholic-minded patron wished to demonstrate the universality of the
  Anglican Church. The experiment will not, I hope, be repeated, for though the
  Vicar was an amiable and devoted man, the appearance of a coloured clergyman
  with a half-caste son in a rude, unrefined parish was bound to cause some
  regrettable situation.</p>

  <p>But no one could have foreseen how serious that situation would become.
  The family became the butt of certain malicious wags in the neighbourhood and
  were bombarded with anonymous letters, some of them of the most monstrous
  description. There was worse, however, to come. A horrible epidemic of
  horse-maiming had broken out, proceeding evidently from some blood-lusting
  lunatic of Sadie propensities. These outrages continued for a long time, and
  the local police were naturally much criticized for doing nothing. It would
  have been as well had they continued to do nothing, for they ended by
  arresting George Edalji for the crime, the main evidence being that there
  were signs that the writer of the anonymous letters knew something about the
  crimes, and that it was thought that young Edalji had written the anonymous
  letters which had plagued his family so long. The evidence was incredibly
  weak, and yet the police, all pulling together and twisting all things to
  their end, managed to get a conviction at the Stafford Quarter Sessions in
  1903. The prisoner was sentenced to seven years' penal servitude.</p>

  <p>There were some murmurs among discerning people at the time, and Mr.
  Voules, of "Truth," has an honourable record for having kept some sort of
  agitation going, but nothing practical was done until the unhappy youth had
  already served three years of his sentence. It was late in 1906 that I
  chanced to pick up an obscure paper called "The Umpire," and my eye caught an
  article which was a statement of his case, made by himself. As I read, the
  unmistakable accent of truth forced itself upon my attention and I realized
  that I was in the presence of an appalling tragedy, and that I was called
  upon to do what I could to set it right. I got other papers on the case,
  studied the original trial, went up to Staffordshire and saw the family, went
  over the scene of the crimes and finally wrote a series of articles on the
  case, which began in the "Daily Telegraph" of January 12, 1907. As I
  bargained that they should be non-copyright they were largely transferred to
  other papers, sold for a penny at street-curbs and generally had a very wide
  circulation, so that England soon rang with the wrongs of George Edalji.</p>

  <p>These wrongs would have been almost comic had they not had so tragic an
  upshot. If the whole land had been raked, I do not think that it would have
  been possible to find a man who was so unlikely, and indeed so incapable, of
  committing such actions. He was of irreproachable character. Nothing in his
  life had ever been urged against him. His old schoolmaster with years of
  experience testified to his mild and tractable disposition. He had served his
  time with a Birmingham solicitor, who gave him the highest references. He had
  never shown traits of cruelty. He was so devoted to his work that he had won
  the highest honours in the legal classes, and he had already at the age of
  twenty-seven written a book upon Railway Law. Finally he was a total
  abstainer, and so blind that he was unable to recognize any one at the
  distance of six yards. It was clear that the inherent improbability of such a
  man committing a long succession of bloody and brutal crimes was so great
  that it could only be met by the suggestion of insanity. There had never,
  however, been any indication even of eccentricity in George Edalji. On the
  contrary, his statements of defence were measured and rational, and he had
  come through a series of experiences which might well have unhinged a weaker
  intellect.</p>

  <p>The original theory at the trial had been that Edalji had committed the
  particular mutilations with which he was charged some time in the evening.
  This line of attack broke down completely, and he was able to advance a
  certain <i>alibi</i>. In the middle of the case, therefore, the police
  prosecution shifted its ground and advanced the new theory that it was done
  in the early hours of the morning. George Edalji, as it happened, slept in
  the same room as his father, the parish vicar. The latter is a light sleeper
  and is accustomed, as many people are, to assure privacy by turning the key
  of his room. He swore that George never left the room during the night. This
  may not constitute an absolute <i>alibi</i> in the eye of the law, but it is
  difficult to imagine anything nearer to one unless a sentinel had been placed
  outside the door all night. It is so near an <i>alibi</i> that nothing but
  the most cogent considerations could shake it, but far from there being any
  such considerations, the case was such a thing of threads and patches that
  one cannot imagine how any sane jury could have accepted it, even though the
  defence was weakly conducted. So bad was this defence that in the whole trial
  no mention, so far as I could ascertain, was ever made of the fact that the
  man was practically blind, save in good light, while between his house and
  the place where the mutilation was committed lay the full breadth of the
  London and North-Western Railway, an expanse of rails, wires and other
  obstacles, with hedges to be forced on either side, so that I, a strong and
  active man, in broad daylight found it a hard matter to pass.</p>

  <p>What aroused my indignation and gave me the driving force to carry the
  thing through was the utter helplessness of this forlorn little group of
  people, the coloured clergyman in his strange position, the brave blue-eyed,
  grey-haired wife, the young daughter, baited by brutal boors and having the
  police, who should have been their natural protectors, adopting from the
  beginning a harsh tone towards them and accusing them, beyond all sense and
  reason, of being the cause of their own troubles and of persecuting and
  maligning themselves. Such an exhibition, sustained, I am sorry to say, by
  Lord Gladstone and all the forces of the Home Office, would have been
  incredible had I not actually examined the facts.</p>

  <p>The articles caused a storm of indignation through the country. "Truth,"
  Sir George Lewis and other forces joined in the good work. A committee was
  formed by the Government to examine and report. It consisted of Sir Arthur
  Wilson, the Hon. John Lloyd Wharton and Sir Albert de Rutzen. Their finding,
  which came to hand in June, was a compromise document, for though they were
  severe upon the condemnation of Edalji and saw no evidence which associated
  him with the crime, they still clung to the theory that he had written the
  anonymous letters, that he had therefore been himself contributory to the
  miscarriage of justice, and that for this reason all compensation for his
  long period of suffering should be denied him.</p>

  <p>It was a wretched decision, and the Law Society at the prompting of Sir
  George Lewis showed what they thought of it by at once readmitting Edalji to
  the roll of solicitors with leave to practise, which they would never have
  done had they thought him capable of dishonourable conduct. But the result
  stands. To this day this unfortunate man, whose humble family has paid many
  hundreds of pounds in expenses, has never been able to get one shilling of
  compensation for the wrong done. It is a blot upon the record of English
  Justice, and even now it should be wiped out. It is to be remembered that the
  man was never tried for writing the letters&mdash;a charge which could not
  have been sustained&mdash;so that as the matter stands he has got no redress
  for three years of admitted false imprisonment, on the score that he did
  something else for which he has never been tried. What a travesty of Justice!
  The "Daily Telegraph" got up a subscription for him which ran to some £300.
  The first use that he made of the money was to repay an old aunt who had
  advanced the funds for his defence. He came to my wedding reception, and
  there was no guest whom I was prouder to see.</p>

  <p>So far, my work had been satisfactory. Where I caused myself great trouble
  was that in my local exploration at Wyrley I had come across what seemed to
  me a very direct clue as to both the writer, or rather writers, of the
  letters, and also of the identity of the mutilator&mdash;though the latter
  word may also have been in the plural. I became interested, the more so as
  the facts were very complex and I had to do with people who were insane as
  well as criminal. I have several letters threatening my life in the same
  writing as those which assailed the Edaljis&mdash;a fact which did not appear
  to shake in the least the Home Office conviction that George Edalji had
  written them all. Mentally I began to class the Home Office officials as
  insane also. The sad fact is that officialdom in England stands solid
  together, and that when you are forced to attack it you need not expect
  justice, but rather that you are up against an unavowed Trade Union the
  members of which are not going to act the blackleg to each other, and which
  subordinates the public interest to a false idea of loyalty. What confronts
  you is a determination to admit nothing which inculpates another official,
  and as to the idea of punishing another official for offences which have
  caused misery to helpless victims, it never comes within their horizon. Even
  now, after the lapse of so many years, I can hardly think with patience of
  the handling of this case.</p>

  <p>The mistake that I made, so far as my own interests were concerned, was
  that having got on the track of the miscreant I let the police and the Home
  Office know my results before they were absolutely completed. There was a
  strong <i>primâ facie</i> case, but it needed the goodwill and co-operation
  of the authorities to ram it home. That co-operation was wanting, which was
  intelligible, in the case of the local police, since it traversed their
  previous convictions and conclusions, but was inexcusable in the Home Office.
  The law officers of the Crown upheld their view that there was not a <i>primâ
  facie</i> case, but I fear that consciously or unconsciously the same trade
  union principle was at work. Let me briefly state the case that the public
  may judge. I will call the suspect "X." I was able to show:</p>

  <p>1. That "X" had shown a peculiar knife or horse-lancet to some one and had
  stated that this knife did the crimes. I had this knife in my possession.</p>

  <p>2. That this knife or a similar knife must have been used in <i>some</i>
  of the crimes, as shown by the shallow incision.</p>

  <p>3. That "X" had been trained in the slaughter-yard and the cattle-ship,
  and was accustomed to brutal treatment of animals.</p>

  <p>4. That he had a clear record both of anonymous letters and of destructive
  propensities.</p>

  <p>5. That his writing and that of his brother exactly fitted into the two
  writings of the anonymous letters. In this I had strong independent
  evidence.</p>

  <p>6. That he had shown signs of periodical insanity, and that his household
  and bedroom were such that he could leave unseen at any hour of the
  night.</p>

  <p>There were very many corroborative evidences, but those were the main
  ones, coupled with the fact that when "X" was away for some years the letters
  and outrages stopped, but began again when he returned. On the other hand,
  when Edalji was put in prison the outrages went on the same as before.</p>

  <p>It will hardly be believed that after I had laid these facts before the
  Home Office they managed to present the House of Commons with the official
  legal opinion that there was not a <i>primâ facie</i> case, while a high
  official of the Government said to me: "I see no more evidence against these
  two brothers than against myself and my brother." The points I mention are
  taken from the paper I laid before the law officers of the Crown, which lies
  before me as I write, so the facts are exactly as stated.</p>

  <p>I had one letter in sorrow and also in anger from the Staffordshire police
  complaining that I should be libelling this poor young man whose identity
  could easily be established.</p>

  <p>I do not know what has become of "X" or how often he has been convicted
  since, but on the last occasion of which I have notes the magistrate said in
  condemning him to six months' imprisonment with hard labour: "His character
  was extremely bad, he having been convicted of arson, of stealing on three
  occasions and of damage. On his own confession he had committed a deliberate
  and cruel theft from his aged mother and it was impossible to overlook the
  seriousness of the case." So much for the inoffensive youth whom I had
  libelled! But what about Edalji's three years of gaol?</p>

  <p>On September 18, 1907, I married Miss Jean Leckie, the younger daughter of
  a Blackheath family whom I had known for years, and who was a dear friend of
  my mother and sister. There are some things which one feels too intimately to
  be able to express, and I can only say that the years have passed without one
  shadow coming to mar even for a moment the sunshine of my Indian summer which
  now deepens to a golden autumn. She and my three younger children with the
  kindly sympathy of my two elder ones have made my home an ideally happy
  one.</p>

  <p>My wife's people had a house at Crowborough, and there they had gone to
  reside. As they were very attached I thought it would be a happy arrangement
  not to separate them, so I bought a house close by, named "Windlesham." As I
  paid for it by a sum of money which I recovered after I had been unjustly
  defrauded of it, my friends suggested "Swindlesham" as a more appropriate
  name. Thus it came about that in 1907 I left Undershaw, Hindhead, after ten
  years' residence, and moved myself and my belongings to the highlands of
  Sussex, where I still dwell in the few months of settled life which give me a
  rest between my wanderings.</p>

  <p>Very soon after my marriage, having just got clear of the Edalji case, I
  became entangled in that of Oscar Slater. The one was in a way the cause of
  the other, for since I was generally given credit for having got Edalji out
  of his troubles, it was hoped by those who believed that Slater's
  condemnation was a miscarriage of justice that I might be able to do the same
  for him. I went into the matter most reluctantly, but when I glanced at the
  facts, I saw that it was an even worse case than the Edalji one, and that
  this unhappy man had in all probability no more to do with the murder for
  which he had been condemned than I had. I am convinced that when on being
  convicted he cried out to the judge that he never knew that such a woman as
  the murdered woman existed he was speaking the literal truth.</p>

  <p>In one respect the Oscar Slater case was not so serious as the Edalji one,
  because Slater was not a very desirable member of society. He had never, so
  far as is known, been in trouble as a criminal, but he was a gambler and
  adventurer of uncertain morals and dubious ways&mdash;a German Jew by
  extraction, living under an alias. Edalji, on the other hand, was a blameless
  youth. But in another aspect Slater's case was worse than that of Edalji,
  since the charge was murder. He was very nearly hanged, and finally the life
  sentence was actually carried out, so that the wrong was never righted and at
  the present moment the unfortunate man is in gaol. It is a dreadful blot upon
  the administration of justice in Scotland, and such judicial crimes are not,
  I am convinced, done with impunity even to the most humble.
  Somehow&mdash;somewhere, there comes a national punishment in return.</p>

  <p>The case was roughly this: an elderly woman, Miss Gilchrist, was done to
  death most brutally in her flat, while her servant-maid, Helen Lambie, was
  absent for ten minutes on an errand. Her head was beaten to pieces by some
  hard instrument. The neighbours were alarmed by the noise, and one of them,
  together with the maid, actually saw the murderer, a young man, leave the
  flat and pass him at the door. The police description at the time was by no
  means in agreement with Slater's appearance. Robbery did not appear to be the
  motive of the crime, for nothing was missing unless it was a single diamond
  brooch. On the other hand, a box of papers had been broken into and left in
  disorder. The date was December 21, 1908.</p>

  <p>And now comes the great fact which is admitted by all, and which makes the
  whole case wildly improbable if not utterly impossible. It was thought that a
  diamond brooch had been taken. It was found out that a diamond brooch had
  also been pawned by the Bohemian Slater, who had started for America. Was it
  not clear that he was the murderer? New York was warned. Slater was arrested
  and in due time was returned to Glasgow. Then came the fiasco. It was found
  beyond all doubt that the brooch in question had been in Slater's possession
  for years, and that it had nothing to do with Miss Gilchrist at all.</p>

  <p>This should have been the end of the case. It was too preposterous to
  suppose that out of all the folk in Glasgow the police had arrested the right
  man by pure chance&mdash;for that was what it amounted to. But the public had
  lost its head, and so had the police. If the case had completely gone to
  pieces surely it could be reconstructed in some fresh form. Slater was poor
  and friendless. He had lived with a woman, which shocked Scotch morality. As
  one writer boldly said in the press: "Even if he did not do it, he deserved
  to be condemned, anyhow." A case was made up in the most absurd manner. A
  half-crown card of tools was found in his box with the sort of tools which
  are found on such cards. The frail hammer was evidently the instrument which
  had beaten in the woman's skull. The handle might have been cleaned. Then
  surely there had been blood on it. The police description was already amended
  so as to be nearer to Slater. He, a sallow, dark-haired Jew, was picked out
  by witnesses from among a group of fair Scotsmen. Some one had been seen
  waiting in the street for some nights before. This some one was variously
  described by many witnesses. Some descriptions would fit Slater, some were
  his very opposite. The people who saw the murderer leave thought it might be
  Slater, but were not sure. The chief witness, Adams, was very short-sighted
  and had not his glasses. A clear <i>alibi</i> was proved by Slater, but as
  his mistress and his servant girl were the witnesses, it was not allowed.
  Whom could he produce save the inmates of his house? No attempt was ever made
  to show that Slater had any connection with Miss Gilchrist, or with the maid,
  Lambie, and as Slater was really a stranger in Glasgow, it was impossible to
  see how he could have known anything about this retired old maid. But he was
  not too well defended, while Mr. Ure, the Advocate-General of Scotland,
  prosecuting for the State, thundered away in a most violent speech in which
  several statements were made, uncorrected by Judge Guthrie, which were very
  inexact, and which must have powerfully swayed the jury. Finally, the Crown
  got a conviction by nine votes to six (five "not proven ")&mdash;which, of
  course, would have meant a new trial in England, and the wretched foreigner
  was condemned to death. The scaffold was actually erected, and it was only
  two mornings before his execution that the order came which prevented a
  judicial murder. As it was, the man became a convict&mdash;and is one
  still.</p>

  <p>It is an atrocious story, and as I read it and realized the wickedness of
  it all, I was moved to do all I could for the man. I was aided by the opinion
  of Sir Herbert Stephen, who read the evidence and declared that there was not
  even a <i>primâ facie</i> case against the man. I, therefore, started a
  newspaper agitation and wrote a small book with an account of the whole
  matter. The consciences of some people responded, and finally we got up
  sufficient pressure to induce the Government to appoint a Commissioner,
  Sheriff Miller, to examine the case. It was all to no purpose, and the
  examination was a farce. The terms of reference were so narrow that the
  conduct of the police was entirely excluded, which was really the very thing
  at issue, since we held that where their original evidence failed them, they
  had strained many points in trying to build up a case and to obtain a
  verdict. It was also decided that evidence should not be on oath. The result
  was that there was no result, nor could there be with such limitations. None
  the less, some fresh evidence was put forward which further weakened the
  already very weak case for the prosecution. For example, at the trial it had
  been stated that Slater, on reaching Liverpool from Glasgow, had gone to a
  Liverpool hotel under a false name, as if he were trying to throw the police
  off his track. It was shown that this was not true, and that he had signed
  the register with his own Glasgow name. I say his Glasgow name, for he had
  several pseudonyms in the course of his not too reputable career, and, as a
  fact, he took his actual passage under a false name, showing that he intended
  to make a clear start in America. He was, according to his own account,
  pursued by some woman&mdash;probably his lawful wife&mdash;and this covering
  of tracks was to escape this huntress. The fact that he used his own name at
  the hotel showed that the new name was for American rather than for British
  use, and that he had no fear of Glasgow pursuit.</p>

  <p>We could do no more, and there the matter rested. There was a very ugly
  aftermath of the case, which consisted of what appeared to be persecution of
  Mr. Trench, a detective who had given evidence at the inquiry which told in
  favour of our view. A charge was shortly afterwards made against both him and
  a solicitor, Mr. Cook, who had been conspicuous upon Slater's side, which
  might well have ruined them both. As it was, it caused them great anxiety and
  expense. There had been a most unpleasant political flavour to the whole
  proceedings; but on this occasion the case came before a Conservative Judge,
  Mr. Scott Dickson, who declared that it should never have been brought into
  court, and dismissed it forthwith with contempt. It is a curious circumstance
  that as I write, in 1924, Judge Guthrie, Cook, Trench, Helen Lambie, Miller
  and others have all passed on. But Slater still remains, eating out his heart
  at Peterhead.</p>

  <p>One strange psychic fact should be mentioned which was brought to my
  notice by an eminent English K.C. There was a Spiritualist circle which used
  to meet at Falkirk, and shortly after the trial messages were received by it
  which purported to come from the murdered woman. She was asked what the
  weapon was which had slain her. She answered that it was an iron box-opener.
  Now I had pondered over the nature of certain wounds in the woman's face,
  which consisted of two cuts with a little bridge of unbroken skin between.
  They might have been caused by the claw end of a hammer, but on the other
  hand, one of the woman's eyes had been pushed back into her brain, which
  could hardly have been done by a hammer, which would have burst the eyeball
  first. I could think of no instrument which would meet the case. But the
  box-opener would exactly do so, for it has a forked end which would make the
  double wound, and it is also straight so that it might very well penetrate to
  the brain, driving the eye in front of it. The reader will reasonably ask why
  did not the Spiritualists ask the name of the criminal. I believe that they
  did and received a reply, but I do not think that such evidence could or
  should ever be used or published. It could only be useful as the starting
  point of an inquiry.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>There was one intervention during those years to which I look back with
  satisfaction, and that was my protest against the King's Oath before the
  Coronation of King Edward. The Oath was actually changed, and though my
  protest may have had no effect upon that historic fact, it was none the less
  the first letter in "The Times" upon the subject.</p>

  <p>It ran thus:</p>

  <p class="letter">SIR,&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  Surely Colonel Sandys and the members of the Protestant Reformation Society
  should, looking at the matter simply from their own point of view, recognize
  that the surest way to strengthen any creed is, as the whole history of the
  world has proved, to persecute it. And it is mere juggling with words to
  attempt to show that it is anything other than persecution to hold up the
  Roman Catholic faith to obloquy in the Coronation Oath, while every other
  creed, Christian or non-Christian, is left unassailed. Is it not a shocking
  thing that, while Roman Catholic chapels throughout the whole Empire are
  still draped in black for a deceased Monarch, his successor should be
  compelled by law to insult the most intimate convictions of these same
  mourners?<br>
  <br>
  And is it not a most narrow and foolish policy, unworthy of this tolerant
  age, that a young King should be forced to offend the feelings of great
  numbers of Irishmen, Canadians and other subjects? I feel sure that, apart
  from Catholics, the great majority of broadminded thinkers of any or of no
  denomination in this country are of opinion that the outcry of fanatics
  should be disregarded, and that all creeds should receive the same courteous
  and respectful treatment so long as their adherents are members of the common
  Empire. To bring these medieval rancours to an end would indeed be an
  auspicious opening of a new reign.<br>
  <br>
  Yours faithfully,<br>

  of Power&mdash;Dorando&mdash;Dramatic Adventures&mdash;Psychic
  Experience&mdash;The Congo Agitation&mdash;Olympic Games&mdash;Divorce
  Reform&mdash;Speculation.</p><br>

  <p class="first">YEARS of peaceful work followed my marriage, broken only by
  two journeys to the Mediterranean, in the course of which we explored some
  out-of-the-way portions of Greece, and visited Egypt, where I found hardly
  one single man left of all the good fellows whom I had once known. In the
  course of our travels we visited Constantinople, looking at the great guns in
  the forts on the Dardanelles, with little thought of all the British lives
  which were to be sacrificed upon those low, dark, heather-clad hills which
  slope down to the Northern shore. In Constantinople we attended the weekly
  selamlik of Abdul Hamid, and saw him with his dyed beard and the ladies of
  his harem as they passed down to their devotions. It was an incredible sight
  to Western eyes to see the crowd of officers and officials, many of them fat
  and short of wind, who ran like dogs behind his carriage in the hope that
  they might catch the Imperial eye. It was Ramadan, and the old Sultan sent me
  a message that he had read my books and that he would gladly have seen me had
  it not been the Holy month. He interviewed me through his Chamberlain and
  presented me with the Order of the Medjedie, and, what was more pleasing to
  me, he gave the Order of the Chevekat to my wife. As this is the Order of
  Compassion, and as my wife ever since she set foot in Constantinople had been
  endeavouring to feed the horde of starving dogs who roamed the streets, no
  gift could have been more appropriate.</p>

  <p>We were admitted secretly and by very special favour into the great Mosque
  of Sophia during the sacred festival which is known as the Night of Power. It
  was a most marvellous spectacle as from the upper circle of pillared arches
  we looked down upon 60,000 lighted lamps and 12,000 worshippers, who made, as
  they rose and fell in their devotions, a sound like the wash of the sea. The
  priests in their high pulpits were screaming like seagulls, and fanaticism
  was in the air. It was at this moment that I saw a woman&mdash;I will not
  call her a lady&mdash;young and flighty, seat herself jauntily on the edge of
  the stone parapet, and look down at the 12,000 men who were facing us. No
  unbeliever should be tolerated there, and a woman was the abomination of
  abominations. I heard a low deep growl and saw fierce bearded faces looking
  up. It only needed one fiery spirit to head the rush and we should have been
  massacred&mdash;with the poor consolation that some of us at least had really
  asked for it. However, she was pulled down, and we made our way as quickly
  and as quietly as possible out of a side door. It was time, I think.</p>

  <p>One curious incident of our journey stands out in my memory. We were
  steaming past Aegina on a lovely day with calm water around us. The captain,
  a courteous Italian, had allowed us to go upon the bridge, and we&mdash;my
  wife and I&mdash;were looking down into the transparent depths when we both
  clearly saw a creature which has never, so far as I know, been described by
  Science. It was exactly like a young ichthyosaurus, about 4 feet long, with
  thin neck and tail, and four marked side-flippers. The ship had passed it
  before we could call any other observer. I was interested to notice that
  Admiral Anstruther in the "Evening News" some years later described, and
  drew, an exactly similar creature which he had seen under water off the Irish
  coast. This old world has got some surprises for us yet.</p>

  <p>Here and there, as I look back at those long and happy years, some
  particular episode flashes vividly into my memory. I do not often do
  journalistic work&mdash;why should one poach upon the preserves of
  others?&mdash;but on the occasion of the Olympic Games of 1908 I was tempted,
  chiefly by the offer of an excellent seat, to do the Marathon Race for the
  "Daily Mail." It was certainly a wonderful experience, for it will be known
  to history as the Dorando Race. Perhaps a few short paragraphs from my
  description may even now recapture the thrill of it. The huge
  crowd&mdash;some 50,000 people&mdash;were all watching the entrance to the
  stadium, the dark gap through which the leader must appear. Then&mdash;</p>

  <p>"At last he came. But how different from the exultant victor whom we
  expected! Out of the dark archway there staggered a little man, with red
  running-drawers, a tiny boy-like creature. He reeled as he entered and faced
  the roar of the applause. Then he feebly turned to the left and wearily
  trotted round the track. Friends and encouragers were pressing round him.</p>

  <p>"Suddenly the whole group stopped. There were wild gesticulations. Men
  stooped and rose again. Good heavens! he has fainted; is it possible that
  even at this last moment the prize may slip through his fingers? Every eye
  slides round to that dark archway. No second man has yet appeared. Then a
  great sigh of relief goes up. I do not think in all that great assembly any
  man would have wished victory to be torn at the last instant from this plucky
  little Italian. He has won it. He should have it.</p>

  <p>"Thank God, he is on his feet again&mdash;the little red legs going
  incoherently, but drumming hard, driven by a supreme will within. There is a
  groan as he falls once more and a cheer as he staggers to his feet. It is
  horrible, and yet fascinating, this struggle between a set purpose and an
  utterly exhausted frame. Again, for a hundred yards, he ran in the same
  furious and yet uncertain gait. Then again he collapsed, kind hands saving
  him from a heavy fall.</p>

  <p>"He was within a few yards of my seat. Amid stooping figures and grasping
  hands I caught a glimpse of the haggard, yellow face, the glazed,
  expressionless eyes, the lank black hair streaked across the brow. Surely he
  is done now. He cannot rise again.</p>

  <p>"From under the archway has darted the second runner, Hayes, Stars and
  Stripes on his breast, going gallantly, well within his strength. There is
  only twenty yards to do if the Italian can do it. He staggered up, no trace
  of intelligence upon his set face, and again the red legs broke into their
  strange automatic amble.</p>

  <p>"Will he fall again? No, he sways, he balances, and then he is through the
  tape and into a score of friendly arms. He has gone to the extreme of human
  endurance. No Roman of the prime ever bore himself better than Dorando of the
  Olympic of 1908. The great breed is not yet extinct."</p>

  <p>Of course the prize went to the American, as his rival had been helped,
  but the sympathy of the crowd, and I am sure of every sporting American
  present, went out to the little Italian. I not only wrote Dorando up, but I
  started a subscription for him in the "Daily Mail," which realized over
  £300&mdash;a fortune in his Italian village&mdash;so that he was able to
  start a baker's shop, which he could not have done on an Olympic medal. My
  wife made the presentation in English, which he could not understand; he
  answered in Italian, which we could not understand; but I think we really did
  understand each other all the same.</p>

  <p>There is no denying that the American team were very unpopular in London,
  though the unpopularity was not national, for the stadium was thick with
  American flags. Everyone admitted that they were a splendid lot of athletes,
  but they were not wisely handled and I saw with my own eyes that they did
  things which would not have been tolerated if done by an English team in New
  York. However, there may well have been some want of tact on both sides, and
  causes at work of which the public knew nothing. When I consider the Dunraven
  Yacht race, and then these Olympic Games, I am by no means assured that sport
  has that international effect for good which some people have claimed for it.
  I wonder whether any of the old Grecian wars had their real origin in the
  awards at Olympia. I may add that we had a dozen or so of the American boys
  down to "Windlesham," where we had a very pleasant day together. I found them
  all excellent fellows. I put up a billiard Olympic prize, and one of them
  bore it off with him. The whole incident was very pleasant.</p>

  <p>My work for a few years after my marriage ran largely in the direction of
  drama, and if it was not lucrative it at least provided us with a good deal
  of amusement and excitement. In the case of one venture this excitement
  became a little too poignant, though all ended well in the end. I had
  dramatized "Rodney Stone" under the name of "The House of Temperley," with
  all the ring scenes and prize fights included, and treated in the most
  realistic fashion. We had an excellent boxing instructor who took one of the
  smaller parts and who not only fought himself but trained the others to a
  remarkable degree of skill. So realistic was it that when on the first night
  the bully, Berks, after a long encounter, went down with a crash from a fine
  raking uppercut, there was an involuntary groan from the whole house, which
  meant as clearly as could be, "There now, you have killed a man for our
  amusement." It was really incredibly well done and I could never have
  believed that such scenes could be so cleverly faked, though it was not
  always done with impunity, for Rex Davies, who played Gloucester Dick,
  assured me that he lost a tooth and broke both a finger and a rib during his
  engagement. The play itself was unequal, but was so very novel and
  sensational in its best scenes that it should have been a considerable
  success. I found no manager who would take the risk, and I had myself to take
  the Adelphi Theatre for a six months' lease, at a rent which with the Company
  worked out at about £600 a week. As on the top of this the production cost
  about £2,000, it will be seen that I was plunging rather deep.</p>

  <p>And luck did not favour us. The furore for boxing had not yet set in.
  Ladies were afraid to come, and imagined it would be a brutal spectacle.
  Those who did come were exhilarated beyond measure, but the prejudice still
  weighed heavily against us. Then there came one of those theatrical slumps
  when everything goes wrong, and finally King Edward died and that killed it
  outright. It was a very serious situation. I still had the theatre upon my
  hands. I might sublet it, or I might not. If I did not, the expense was
  simply ruinous.</p>

  <p>It was under these circumstances that, as I have already said, I wrote and
  rehearsed "The Speckled Band" in record time, and so saved the situation. The
  real fault of this play was that in trying to give Holmes a worthy antagonist
  I overdid it and produced a more interesting personality in the villain. The
  terrible ending was also against it. However, it was a considerable success
  and saved a difficult&mdash;almost a desperate&mdash;situation.</p>

  <p>Yet another theatrical venture was my "Fires of Fate," some of which is
  certainly the best dramatic work that I have ever done. It was unlucky, as it
  was produced in a very hot summer. I carried it at my own expense through the
  two impossible holiday months, but when Lewis Waller, who played the hero,
  returned from a provincial tour to London, he' was keen on some new play and
  my "Fires" were never really burned out. I fancy sometimes that they might
  even now flame up again if given a chance. I stage managed most of this play
  myself, and with curious results. There are certain dramatic
  conventionalities which can only be broken through by one who is not himself
  an actor. There was a scene where a number of helpless tourists, men and
  women, were brutally ill-treated by Arabs. The brutality in rehearsal was
  conventional. I made the Arabs get imitation whips and cudgels and really
  savage the poor travellers. The effect was novel and appalling. There was a
  young Welsh officer in the front of the stalls who was a friend of my
  brother's. He held both the V.C. and the D.S.O. So stirred was he by the
  sight that he could hardly be restrained from clambering on to the stage in
  order to help the unhappy tourists. The end of that act, when the drove of
  bleeding captives are led away and you hear the monotonous song of the Arabs
  as they march, and you see Lewis Waller, who has been left for dead, struggle
  up on his elbow and signal across the Nile for assistance, was one which
  brought the whole house to its feet. Such moments to a dramatist give a
  thrill of personal satisfaction such as the most successful novelist never
  can feel. There is no more subtle pleasure if you are really satisfied with
  your work than to sit in the shadow of a box and watch not the play but the
  audience.</p>

  <p>I had one other dramatic venture, "Brigadier Gerard," which also was
  mildly successful. In fact, I have never known failure on the stage save in
  the case of the unfortunate "Jane Annie." Lewis Waller played the Brigadier
  and a splendid dashing Hussar he made. It was a glorious performance. I
  remember that in this play also I ran up against the conventionalities of the
  stage. I had a group of Hussar officers, the remnants of the regiment which
  had gone through Napoleon's last campaign. When it came to the dress
  rehearsal, I found them, to my horror, dressed up in brand new uniforms of
  chestnut and silver. "Good heavens!" I cried. "This is not a comic opera!"
  "What do you want done?" asked Waller. "Why," said I, "these men are
  warriors, not ballet dancers. They have been out in all weathers day and
  night for months. Every scrap of truth goes out of the play if they appear
  like that." The uniforms had cost over a hundred pounds, but I covered them
  with mud and dust and tore holes in them. The result was that, with begrimed
  faces, I got a band of real Napoleonic soldiers. Waller himself insisted on
  retaining his grease paint and his nice new clothes, but I am sure every man
  in the audience, if not every woman, would have liked him better as I had
  made the others. Poor Willie Waller! There was some strange and wonderful
  blood in his veins. He was a glorious fellow, and his premature death a great
  blow to our stage. What virility! What a face and figure! They called him the
  "Flappers' idol," and it reflects credit on the flapper, for where could she
  find a less sickly and more manly type? He caught his fatal illness in
  serving the soldiers. One of his greatest possessions was his voice. He came
  down to "Windlesham" once, and as he was reciting in the music-room that
  wonderful resonant voice chanced to catch the exact note which corresponded
  to the curve of all the glass lampshades on the walls. They all started
  thrilling as a wine-glass does when it is touched. I could quite believe
  after that, that matter could be disintegrated by sound if the sound were
  strong enough. I am not clear what blood ran in Waller's veins, Hebrew or
  Basque or both. I only know that it went to make a very wonderful man. His
  intense feeling about everything that he did was one of his characteristics
  and no doubt a cause of his success. It did not carry him far in golf,
  however. I remember hearing him as he approached the last tee mutter, "God,
  give me <i>one</i> good drive." I fear, however, that the betting was against
  it.</p>

  <p>In 1910 a fresh task opened up before me. It arose from my being deeply
  moved by reading some of the evidence concerning the evil rule, not of
  Belgium, but of the King of the Belgians in the Congo. I examined this
  evidence carefully before I accepted it, and I assured myself that it was
  supported by five British Consuls and by Lord Cromer, as well as by
  travellers of many races, Belgian, French, American, Swedish and others. An
  attempt has been made since to minimize the facts and to pretend that Roger
  Casement had been at the back of the agitation for sinister purposes of his
  own. This contention is quite untenable and the evidence for the atrocities
  is overwhelming and from very many sources, the Belgians themselves being
  among the best witnesses. I put in some two years working with Mr. Morel and
  occasionally lecturing in the country upon this question, and it was
  certainly the efforts of the Congo Association which we represented, that
  eventually brought the question to the notice of that noble man King Albert
  which meant setting it right so that the colony is now, so far as I know,
  very well managed. Casement, whom I shall always regard as a fine man
  afflicted with mania, has met his tragic end, and Morel's views upon the war
  have destroyed the feelings which I had for him, but I shall always maintain
  that they both did noble work in championing the wrongs of those unhappy and
  helpless negroes. My own book "The Crime of the Congo," which was translated
  into all European languages, had also, I hope, some influence towards that
  end.</p>

  <p>In the early summer of 1912 I had a telegram from Lord Northcliffe which
  let me in for about as much trouble as any communication which I have ever
  received. It was to the effect that Britain must regain her place among the
  athletic nations which had been temporarily eclipsed by the Olympic Games at
  Stockholm, and that I was the one man in Great Britain who could rally round
  me the various discordant forces which had to be united and used. This was
  very complimentary, but it was Lord Northcliffe's sole contribution to the
  matter for a very long time, and I was left to my own devices entirely in
  carrying out a complex task. So badly co-ordinated were Northcliffe's papers
  that I had some of them actually attacking me while I was working on their
  chief's suggestion.</p>

  <p>When I examined I found chaos. On the one hand was the British Olympic
  Committee, a most sound and respectable body, under Lord Desborough. In some
  way they had lost touch with press and public and were generally in
  disfavour, though really they had done their best. On the other hand was "The
  Times," which had worked itself into a fury about the misdeeds of the
  Committee, and had set a tone which poisoned the whole press against them.
  Lord Northcliffe would have nothing to do with anything which emanated from
  the Committee; the Committee defied Lord Northcliffe. It was clear that this
  had to be cleared up as a preliminary, and the matter took enough diplomacy
  to have settled the Balkan question. I called upon the Committee and
  suggested that an independent body be formed on which they could be
  represented. To this they agreed. I then called on "The Times" and said: "You
  are no longer dealing with the old Olympic Committee, but with a new body. Do
  you agree to this?" Yes, that was all in order. I may have omitted the
  trifling fact that the new body did not yet exist. I then asked Mr. Studd,
  the famous cricketer of old and head of the Polytechnic to help me to form
  the new body. We soon had a very effective one, including several leading
  athletes and Lord Forster, now Governor-General of Australia. I served, of
  course, on the Committee, and soon we were in touch with every one and all
  promised to go smoothly.</p>

  <p>But presently a huge mistake was made. I don't wish to represent myself as
  the fount of all wisdom, and no doubt I make as many slips as my fellows, but
  that particular one would never have been made had I been present, but I was
  called away and was out of the country at that crucial Committee meeting. It
  had been already determined that an appeal to the public over all our names
  should be issued. The amount had not been discussed, but in my own mind I had
  thought that £10,000 would suffice. I was horrified, therefore, when I
  returned from my holiday to find that they had appealed for £100,000. The sum
  was absurd, and at once brought upon us from all sides the charge of
  developing professionalism. My position was very difficult. If I protested
  now it would go far to ruin the appeal. After all it might succeed. I could
  only fall into line with the others and do my best for the sake of the cause
  to defend a policy which I looked upon as mistaken. We actually collected
  about £7,000, and finally, as we found that the general feeling was either
  hostile or apathetic, we handed over this sum to the Olympic Committee. Then
  came the war, and so in any case our labour was in vain, for the Games were
  to be in Berlin in 1916. We were all playing another game by then. This
  matter was spread over a year of my life and was the most barren thing that I
  ever touched, for nothing came of it, and I cannot trace that I ever received
  one word of thanks from any human being. I was on my guard against
  Northcliffe telegrams after that.</p>

  <p>I remember one curious episode about that time. I was staying in a
  Northumberland Avenue Hotel, and I walked out at night in pensive mood,
  strolling down the Embankment and watching the great dark river with the
  gleam of the lights upon it. Suddenly a man passed me, walking very rapidly
  and muttering in an incoherent way. He gave me an impression of desperation
  and I quickened my pace and followed him. With a rush he sprang up on the
  parapet and seemed to be about to throw himself into the river. I was just in
  time to catch his knees and to pull him down. He struggled hard to get up,
  but I put my arm through his and led him across the road. There I reasoned
  with him and examined into the cause of his troubles. He had had some
  domestic quarrel, I believe, but his main worry was his business, which was
  that of a baker. He seemed a respectable man and the case seemed genuine, so
  I calmed him down, gave him such immediate help as I could, and made him
  promise to return home and to keep in touch with me afterwards.</p>

  <p>When the excitement of the incident was over, I had grave doubts as to
  whether I had not been the victim of a clever swindler. I was considerably
  relieved, therefore, to get a letter a few days later, giving name and
  address, and obviously genuine. I lost sight of the case after that.</p>

  <p>Another matter which preoccupied me much in the years before the war, and
  preoccupies me still, is the Reform of our Divorce Laws. I was president of
  the Reform Union for ten years and have only just vacated the position in
  order to make room for a far more efficient successor in Lord Birkenhead. I
  am quite alive to all the arguments of our opponents, and quite understand
  that laxity in the marriage tie is an evil, but I cannot understand why
  England should lag behind every other Protestant country in the world, and
  even behind Scotland, so that unions which are obviously disgusting and
  degrading are maintained in this country while they can be dissolved in our
  Colonies or abroad. As to morality I cannot, I fear, admit that our morality
  here is in the least better than in Scandinavia, Holland or Germany, where
  they have more rational laws. I think that in some States in America they
  have pushed Divorce to an extreme, but even in America I should say that
  married happiness and morality generally are quite as high as with us. The
  House of Lords has shown itself to be more liberal in this matter than the
  Commons, possibly because the latter have a fear of organized Church
  influence in their constituencies. It is one of several questions which makes
  me not sorry to see Labour, with its larger outlook, in power for a time in
  this country. Our marriage laws, our land laws, the cheapening of justice and
  many other things have long called out for reform, and if the old parties
  will not do it then we must seek some new one which will.</p>

  <p>During these long and happy years, when the smooth current of our national
  life was quietly sliding toward Niagara, I did not lose my interest in
  psychic matters, but I cannot say that I increased my grasp of the religious
  or spiritual side of the subject. I read, however, and investigated whenever
  the chance arose. A gentleman had arranged a series of physical séances in a
  large studio in North London, and I attended them, the mediums being Cecil
  Husk and Craddock. They left a very mixed impression upon my mind, for in
  some cases, I was filled with suspicion and in others I was quite sure that
  the result was genuine. The possibility that a genuine medium may be
  unscrupulous and that when these very elusive forces fail to act he may
  simulate them is one which greatly complicates the whole subject, but one can
  only concentrate upon what one is sure is true and try to draw conclusions
  from that. I remember that many sheeted ghosts walked about in the dim light
  of a red lamp on these occasions, and that some of them came close to me,
  within a foot of my face, and illuminated their features by the light of a
  phosphorescent slate held below them. One splendid Arab, whom the medium
  called Abdullah, came in this fashion. He had a face like an idealized W. G.
  Grace, swarthy, black-bearded and dignified, rather larger than human. I was
  looking hard at this strange being, its nose a few inches from my own, and
  was wondering whether it could be some very clever bust of wax, when in an
  instant the mouth opened and a terrific yell was emitted. I nearly jumped out
  of my chair. I saw clearly the gleaming teeth and the red tongue. It
  certainly seemed that he had read my thought and had taken this very
  effective way of answering it.</p>

  <p>Some of the excitements of my life during these and the subsequent years
  were due to financial entanglements which arose from a certain speculative
  element in my own nature, depending rather upon the love of adventure than
  upon any hope of gain. If when I earned money I had dug a hole in the garden
  and buried it there I should be a much richer man to-day. I can hardly blame
  the punter on the racecourse when I remember the outside chances which I have
  taken in the past in every possible form of speculation. But I have the
  advantage over the mere gambler in this, that every pound of my money went to
  develop something or other and lined the pocket of the working man, who, by
  the way, when he grumbles over the profits of the Capitalist never even
  alludes to his losses. If a balance sheet were struck it would be interesting
  to see what, if any, is the exact margin of profit.</p>

  <p>It is true that sometimes I have indulged in a pure gamble but never for
  any sum which would hurt me. I have painful memories of a guano island off
  South Africa on which our treasure seekers were not even allowed to land,
  though every bird's nest was rumoured to contain a diamond. The Spanish
  galleon in the bay of Tobermory also took treasure rather than gave it, and
  the return for my shares was a lump of glass and a rusted bar. That was more
  than ever I had from certain spots in Kalgurli and Coolgardie and other
  alleged goldbearers, which have nearly all been gold consumers so far as I am
  concerned. I fear some of those mines were like that legendary one where the
  manager, getting a cable which ordered him to start crushing, replied, "I
  have nothing to crush until you return samples."</p>

  <p>I have played my involuntary part also in the development of the Rand and
  Rhodesia, from those early and unsophisticated days when I misread the
  quotation and meaning to invest £60 was faced next morning with a bill for
  £900. Occasionally it is true that I backed a winner, but as a rule I must
  confess that I was not judicious in my selections.</p>

  <p>But it was at home that I expended myself most freely. I saw the enormous
  possibilities of Kent coal, which even now are not fully understood; but I
  did not sufficiently weigh the impossibilities, which are that an enterprise
  can be successful which is wildly financed and extravagantly handled. I and
  many others lost our money sinking the shafts which may bring fortunes to our
  successors. I even descended 1,000 feet through the chalk to see with my own
  eyes that the coal was in situ. It seems to have had the appearance and every
  other quality of coal save that it was incombustible, and when a dinner was
  held by the shareholders which was to be cooked by local coal, it was
  necessary to send out and buy something which would burn. There were,
  however, lower strata which were more sensitive to heat. Besides Kent Coal I
  lost very heavily in running a manufacturing plant in Birmingham, into which
  I was led by those successive stages in which you are continually trying to
  save what you have already invested until the situation becomes so serious
  that you drop it in terror. We turned from bicycles to munitions during the
  war, and actually worked hard the whole four years, with a hundred artisans
  making needful war material, without ever declaring a penny of dividend.
  This, I should think, must be a record, and at least no one could call us
  profiteers. The firm was eventually killed dead by the successive strikes of
  the moulders and the miners. It is amazing how one set of workmen will ruin
  another set without apparently any remonstrance from the sufferers. Another
  bad egg was a sculpture machine for architectural work, which really had
  great possibilities, but we could not get the orders. I was chairman of this
  company, and it cost me two years of hard work and anxiety, ending up by my
  paying the balance out of my own pocket, so that we might wind up in an
  honourable way. It was a dismal experience with many side adventures attached
  to it, which would make a sensational novel.</p>

  <p>Such are some of the vicissitudes which cannot be disregarded in a
  retrospect of life, for they form a very integral and absorbing part of it. I
  have had my ill luck and I have had my good. Amid the latter I count the fact
  that I have been for twenty-one years a director of Raphael Tuck &amp; Co.,
  without the least cloud to darken the long and pleasant memory. I have also
  been for many years chairman of Besson's famous brass instrument firm. I
  think a man should know all sides of life, and he has missed a very essential
  side if he has not played his part in commerce. In investments, too, I would
  not imply that I have always been unfortunate. My speculative adventures are
  over, and I can at least say that unless the British Empire goes down I shall
  be able to retain enough for our modest needs.</p>

     id="ch-23"></a>XXIII &mdash; SOME NOTABLE PEOPLE</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">President Roosevelt&mdash;Lord Balfour&mdash;Mr.
  Asquith&mdash;Lord Haldane&mdash;George Meredith&mdash;Rudyard
  Kipling&mdash;James Barrie&mdash;Henry Irving&mdash;Bernard
  Shaw&mdash;R.L.S.&mdash;Grant Allen&mdash;James Payn&mdash;Henry
  Thompson&mdash;Royalty.</p><br>

  <p class="first">WHEN I have chanced during my life to come in contact with
  notable people, I have often made some short record at the time of what they
  said and how they impressed me. It is difficult, however, to use these notes
  for publication when you happen to have been a guest, and it can only be
  done, I think, by using one's judgment and never consciously harming one's
  host. If every one were altogether silent upon such occasions the most
  pleasing side of great contemporaries would never be chronicled, for the
  statesman in slippers is a very much more human and lovable person than the
  politician on the platform.</p>

  <p>Among the great men that I have known President Roosevelt occupied a
  prominent place. He was not a big, nor, so far as one could see, a powerful
  man, but he had tremendous dynamic force and an iron will which may account
  for his reputation as an athlete. He had all the simplicity of real
  greatness, speaking his mind with great frankness and in the clearest
  possible English. He had in him a great deal of the boy, a mischievous,
  adventurous, high-spirited boy, with a deep, strong, thoughtful manhood in
  the background. We were present, my wife and I, at the Guildhall when he made
  his memorable speech about Egypt, in which he informed a gathering, which
  contained the Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, and many of our Cabinet,
  that we should either rule more strictly or clear out altogether. It was, of
  course, a most unwarrantable intrusion into our affairs, but it was a
  calculated indiscretion, and very welcome, I believe, to those who were
  dealing with Egypt. As he made his way through the dense crowd afterwards he
  passed me and said with a grin: "I say, I let them have it that time, didn't
  I?" There was the mischievous boy coming out.</p>

  <p>He had a quick blunt wit which showed itself often in his metaphors. He
  spoke to me, I remember, of some one who had a nine guinea-pig-power brain.
  One of his entourage told me how the President had been awakened once to
  address some prairie folk at a wayside station. "They have come sixty miles
  to see you," said his secretary. "They would have come a hundred to see a cat
  with two heads," said the ruffled President.</p>

  <p>I met him once at a small luncheon party at the invitation of Lord Lee,
  who had soldiered with him in Cuba. He was extremely talkative in fact, I can
  hardly remember anyone else saying anything. Thinking it over afterwards I
  concluded that two ideas were running through his mind, and every now and
  then coming to the surface. They were formidable ideas, and may have been
  some temporary wave of feeling, but they were certainly in his thoughts. The
  one was that there would be another civil war in the States. The second, that
  if you had the farmer class on your side they presented the best military
  material. From this I gathered that it was not a geographical but an economic
  struggle that was in his mind. <i>Absit omen</i>, but great men are often
  pessimists, and the Duke of Wellington was deeply convinced that Britain
  could not long survive his death.</p>

  <p>When Roosevelt was shot I sent him a cable to express that sympathy which
  every Englishman felt. I have his answer before me, written only a day or so
  after the event:</p>

  <p class="letter">MERCY HOSPITAL,<br>
  CHICAGO,<br>
  <i>October</i> 19, 1912.<br>
  <br>
  DEAR MR. DOYLE,&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  Many thanks for your kind message of sympathy. As you know, a bullet wound is
  rather a serious thing, but all conditions seem to be favourable, and I hope
  in a few days we will all be relieved from anxiety.<br>
  <br>
  Sincerely yours,<br>
  THEODORE ROOSEVELT.</p>

  <p>It is typewritten, but signed by his own hand. I do not think that a more
  brave and detached letter was ever written by a sufferer.</p>

  <p>Roosevelt was a very loud hearty man, with a peculiar wild-beast toothy
  grin, and an explosive habit of slapping his hand down for emphasis. I jotted
  down a few of his <i>obiter dicta</i> after our conversation. He had no good
  word for Henry James. "He is not a whole man. All that subtlety is really
  decadence." He was very virile, not to say heroic in his views. "A man should
  guard particularly against being led from his duty, especially a dangerous
  duty, by his women. I guess a woman would have had a bad time if she had
  tried to lead Leonidas from the pass." Of the German Emperor he said that he
  was jealous of the King's dog at the King's funeral because he attracted the
  more notice. Altogether he was one of the raciest talkers I have ever
  met.</p>

  <p>Among the occasional great ones of earth whom I have met there is hardly
  anyone who stands out more clearly than Arthur Balfour, with his willowy
  figure, his gentle intellectual face, and, as I read it, his soul of steel. I
  should think that of all men of our day he was the last who would be turned
  from any path which he had deliberately taken, but, on the other hand, he was
  capable of standing a most unconscionable time at the place where paths
  divide, for his mind was so subtle and active that he would always see the
  two sides of every question and waver between them. He could never have been
  a pioneer.</p>

  <p>The occasion of our first meeting was a most ridiculous one. Old Lord
  Burnham, the first of his line, had invited me down to his country house at
  Beaconsfield&mdash;a wonderful house which had been built originally by
  Waller, the Royalist poet. Burke had lived close by, and the dagger which, in
  a melodramatic moment, he threw upon the floor of the house, in order to show
  the dangers of French Republican propaganda, is still on exhibition. I can
  remember the party well, though nearly all of them are now on the farther
  side. I see Lady Dorothy Nevill with her mittened hands and her prim
  pussy-cat manner, retailing gossip about Disraeli's flirtations. Sir Henry
  James walks under the trees with bended head, talking to the rising barrister
  who is destined as Lord Reading to be Viceroy of India. Lady Cleveland,
  mother of Lord Rosebery, is listening with her old face wreathed in smiles to
  Lady Dorothy's scandal. Young Harry Irving looks unutterably bored as Lord
  Burnham explains golf to him, bending his head over to get a glimpse of the
  ball round the curve of his goodly waistcoat. Mr. Asquith stands smiling
  beside them. As one looks back they seem all to have been shadows in a world
  of shadow.</p>

  <p>Lord Burnham's hobby was Turkish baths, and he had an excellent one in the
  front of the house, the drying room being the first door on the right as one
  entered, and being a simple sitting-room as far as appearance went. With his
  usual kind hospitality Lord Burnham had urged me to try his bath, and having
  done so I was placed, arrayed in a long towel, and with another towel screwed
  round my head, in the drying room. Presently the door opened, and entered
  Arthur Balfour, Prime Minister of England. He knew nothing of the house or
  its ways, and I can remember the amazement with which he gazed at me. Lord
  Burnham following at his heels introduced me, and I raised the towel on my
  head. There were no explanations, and I felt that he went away with the
  impression that this was my usual costume.</p>

  <p>I did not see him after that week-end&mdash;he kept his room, I remember,
  until midday on the Sunday&mdash;until some years later when, after heavy
  domestic loss, I was endeavouring to collect myself again in a little inn
  near Dunbar. He heard of my presence, and in his kindness sent a car over
  from Whittingehame, only a few miles away, with a request that I should come
  over for a couple of days. There was present his brother, Gerald Balfour, a
  man with a beautifully refined face and manner, not unlike that of Andrew
  Lang. His wife is the famous Lady Betty Balfour, the daughter of Lord Lytton.
  When one thinks of that group of inter-allied families&mdash;the Balfours,
  Cecils, Sedgwicks, and Lyttons&mdash;it seems a sort of nerve ganglion of
  British life. There was also Lady Frances Balfour, who was a daughter of the
  Duke of Argyle, and not unlike him, as I can remember him. Her husband was
  Arthur Balfour's brother, an architect and antiquary, while another brother
  was Colonel of the London Scottish. Finally, there was Miss Alice Balfour, a
  very sweet and gently intellectual person, who was my actual hostess.</p>

  <p>I found Arthur Balfour in great spirits because he had just won a golf
  medal at North Berwick. He seemed as pleased as any schoolboy, and his sister
  told me that no political success ever gave him the keen pleasure which he
  had from his golf victory. He was an average player, orthodox in style, and
  about 10 or 12 in handicap. He proved to be a charming host, for he was a
  good listener, seeming to be really eager to hear your opinion, laughed
  heartily at small provocation, and talked always very frankly and modestly of
  himself. After my long solitude I was more loquacious, I remember, than is my
  way, but he bore it with good humour.</p>

  <p>Every night&mdash;or at least on the Sunday night&mdash;the whole staff of
  the large rambling establishment, maids and grooms, some twenty in all, came
  in for prayers, which were read by the head of the house. It was fine to hear
  groom and statesman praying humbly together that they be forgiven the sins of
  the day, and merging all earthly distinctions in the presence of that which
  is above us all.</p>

  <p>He was very interesting when he spoke of the outrage which the Russian
  fleet had committed when, on their way to Japan, they opened fire at the
  British trawlers on the Dogger Bank. It was curious to hear his gentle voice
  and to note his listless impersonal manner while he spoke in this fashion: "I
  was very angry, really very angry about that affair. If our fleet had been at
  home I should have been inclined to have stopped them in the Straits. Of
  course, one would not do that unless one had overpowering force, so as to
  avoid bloodshed and save the Russian face. Their Ambassador called that
  morning and gave complete assurances, or really I should have had to do
  something. He got himself into trouble with his own Government, who felt that
  he had given away their case."</p>

  <p>I asked him how Cabinet Councils were worked. He said that they voted upon
  points and went by majorities, unless it was a vital thing, when of course
  the dissenters must resign.</p>

  <p>I observed in his character a very great horror of cowardice. Nothing
  seemed to arouse such scorn in him. He grew quite red, I remember, as he
  spoke of Lord George Sackville, and recalled that though he had been broken
  and should have been shot at the Battle of Minden in 1759, he was none the
  less Minister of War during the American campaign. He was also, as I reminded
  him, a most debauched man; and the murder of his mistress, Miss Reay, the
  actress, by her true lover, the clergyman Hackman, was one of the <i>causes
  célèbres</i> of that century.</p>

  <p>I shall always carry away the memory of that visit&mdash;a bright gleam in
  a dark passage of life. I see very clearly the old house, the huge broken
  tree outside, inside which a State conspiracy was once hatched, the fine
  library with its wealth of French memoirs, and above all the remarkable man
  who stood for so much in the life of the country. I was not at that time so
  convinced of the primary importance of psychic things as I became later, and
  I regret it, as this would have been my one opportunity to explore a
  knowledge which at that time was certainly greater than my own. Years later,
  when the fight was heavy upon me, and when I was almost alone in the
  polemical arena, I wrote to Mr. Balfour, and charged him with sharing all my
  convictions and yet leaving me to defend them single-handed. His answer was:
  "Surely my opinions upon this subject are already sufficiently well known,"
  which is surely an admission that I was right in my description of them, and
  yet was not much of a prop to me in my time of need.</p>

  <p>I cast my mind back to other statesmen whom I have known, and Mr.
  Asquith's kindly personality comes into my memory. I remember playing a round
  of golf with him once&mdash;and a very bad player he was&mdash;but his
  conversation as we went round was plus four. He was a naturally sweet-natured
  man, but under that gentleness there lay judgment and firmness, as was shown
  at the great crisis of history. He never said too much, but what he did say
  he lived up to. In conducting us safely through those first two years of war
  he did that for which he has never had sufficient credit, and the more light
  we have had since, the more clear it has been that Lord Kitchener and he were
  really doing all that men could do, in munition work and all other ways.
  Because he had the solid Yorkshire stolidity, more nervous and excitable
  people thought that he did not take the war sufficiently seriously, while the
  constant lies about the pro-German tendencies of his wife increased the evil
  impression. We owe him a reparation which is second only to that which is due
  to Lord Haldane.</p>

  <p>And that is indeed a heavy one. If one man could be named who was
  absolutely indispensable to victory it was Haldane. He it was who built up
  the whole splendid weapon which flashed so swiftly from its sheath, and which
  Germany was so amazed to find directed at its breast as it rushed forward
  upon its furious course. He could not work miracles; he could not introduce
  conscription when a candidate with such a programme would have been chased
  from the hustings; he could not prepare the public mind in some dramatic way
  which would have precipitated the very crash which there was still some
  chance of avoiding. But all we had he gave us&mdash;the eight divisions which
  saved France, the Territorials who carried on the good work until the new
  armies were ready, and the Officers' Training Corps, which strengthened us
  where we should have been fatally weak. There has never been so foolish and
  ungrateful a clamour as that which has been raised against Haldane. I
  remember that when he took the chair for me in the first war lecture which I
  gave in London there were cries of "Traitor!" from people, chiefly women,
  among the audience. I had never seen Haldane before, and have never seen him
  since, so I have no personal bias in the matter, but I am proud that it was
  in my first volume of the "History of the War," published in 1915, that I
  first put forward the unpopular view which will now be more fully
  accepted.</p>

  <p>With George Meredith I had several interesting connections. I have the
  greatest possible admiration for him at his best, while his worst is such a
  handicap that I think it will drag four-fifths of his work to oblivion. If
  his own generation finds him hard to understand, what will our descendants
  make of him? He will be a cult among a few&mdash;a precious few in every
  sense. And yet I fully recognize that his was the most active original brain
  and the most clever pen of any man, novelist or otherwise, of my time.
  Knowing this well, it is strange that I can see so limited a future for him.
  His subtle and intricate mind seemed unable to realize the position of the
  plain outsiders who represent the world. He could not see how his
  stained-glass might be less effective than the plain transparent substance as
  a medium for vision. The first requisite is to be intelligible. The second is
  to be interesting. The third is to be clever. Meredith enormously filled the
  third, but he was unequal upon the other two. Hence he will never, in spite
  of the glories of "Richard Feverel" be on an equality with Dickens or
  Thackeray, who filled all three. He had simply no idea how his words would
  strike a less complex mind. I remember that once in the presence of Barrie,
  Quiller-Couch and myself, he read out a poem which he had inscribed "To the
  British Working-Man" in the "Westminster Gazette." I don't know what the
  British working-man made of it, but I am sure that we three were greatly
  puzzled as to what it was about.</p>

  <p>I had written some articles on his work, which had been one of my youthful
  cults, and that led to his inviting me to see him at his villa at Box
  Hill&mdash;the first of several such visits. There had been a good deal in
  the papers about his health, so that I was surprised when, as I opened the
  garden gate, a slight but robust gentleman in a grey suit and a red tie swung
  out of the hall door and came singing loudly down the path. I suppose he was
  getting on to seventy at the time but he looked younger, and his artistic
  face was good to the eye. Greeting me he pointed to a long steep hill behind
  the house and said: "I have just been up to the top for a walk." I looked at
  the sharp slope and said: "You must be in good trim to do it." He looked
  angry and said: "That would be a proper compliment to pay to an
  octogenarian." I was a little nettled by his touchiness, so I answered: "I
  understood that I was talking to an invalid." It really seemed as if my visit
  would terminate at the garden gate, but presently he relented, and we soon
  became quite friendly.</p>

  <p>He had in his youth been a judge of wine, and had still a reverence for a
  good vintage, but unfortunately some nervous complaint from which he suffered
  had caused the doctors to prohibit it absolutely. When lunch came round he
  asked me with a very earnest air whether I could undertake to drink a whole
  bottle of Burgundy. I answered that I saw no insuperable difficulty. A dusty
  old bottle was tenderly carried up, which I disposed of, Meredith taking a
  friendly interest in its dispatch. "The fact is," said he, "I love my wine,
  and my little cellar was laid down with care and judgment, so that when some
  guest comes and drinks a glass and wastes the rest of the bottle it goes to
  my heart. It really did me good to see you enjoy that one." I need not say
  that I intimated that I was always prepared to oblige.</p>

  <p>His conversation was extraordinarily vivid and dramatic, uttered in a most
  vehement tone. It may have been artificial, and it may have been acting, but
  it was very arresting and entertaining. The talk got upon Napoleon's
  Marshals, and you would have thought that he knew them intimately, and he did
  Murat's indignation at being told to charge <i>au bout</i>, as if he ever
  charged any other way, in a fashion which would have brought down the house.
  Every now and then he brought out a Meredithian sentence which sounded comic
  when applied to domestic matters. When the jelly swayed about as the maid put
  it on the table he said: "The jelly, Mary, is as treacherous as the Trojan
  Horse." He laughed when I told him how my groom, enlisted as a waiter for
  some special dinner, said, "Huddup, there," to the jelly under similar
  circumstances.</p>

  <p>After lunch we walked up a steep path to the little chalet or summerhouse
  where he used to write. He wished to read me a novel which he had begun
  twenty years before, but which he had not had the heart to go on with. I
  liked it greatly&mdash;and we roared with laughter at his description of an
  old sea-dog who turned up the collar of his coat when he went into action as
  if the bullets were rain. He said that my hearty enjoyment encouraged him to
  go on with it, and it has since appeared as the "Amazing Marriage," but
  whether I really had anything to do with it I do not know. I should be proud
  to think so.</p>

  <p>The nervous complaint from which he suffered caused him to fall down
  occasionally. As we walked up the narrow path to the chalet I heard him fall
  behind me, but judged from the sound that it was a mere slither and could not
  have hurt him. Therefore I walked on as if I had heard nothing. He was a
  fiercely proud old man, and my instincts told me that his humiliation in
  being helped up would be far greater than any relief I could give him. It was
  certainly a nice point to decide.</p>

  <p>George Meredith's religious convictions were very difficult to decide. He
  certainly had no glimmering so far as I could see of any psychic element in
  life, and I should imagine that on the whole he shared the opinions of his
  friend, John Morley, which were completely negative. And yet I remember his
  assuring me that prayer was a very necessary thing, and that one should never
  abandon prayer. "Who rises from prayer a better man, his prayer is granted,"
  says the Aphorist in "Richard Feverel." How far these positions can be
  harmonized I do not know. I suppose that one may say that God is unknown, and
  yet rear a mental temple to the unknown God.</p>

  <p>Rudyard Kipling I know far less than I should, considering how deeply I
  admire his writings, and that we live in the same county; but we are both
  absorbed in work, and both much away from home, which may explain it. I can
  well remember how eagerly I bought his first book, "Plain Tales," in the old
  Southsea days, when buying a book was a rare strain upon my exchequer. I read
  it with delight, and realized not only that a new force had arisen in
  literature, but that a new method of story writing had appeared which was
  very different from my own adherence to the careful plot artfully developed.
  This was go-as-you-please take-it-or-leave-it work, which glowed suddenly up
  into an incandescent phrase or paragraph, which was the more effective for
  its sudden advent. In form his stories were crude, and yet in
  effect&mdash;which, after all, is everything&mdash;they were superb. It
  showed me that methods could not be stereotyped, and that there was a more
  excellent way, even if it were beyond my reach. I loved the "Barrack Room
  Ballads" also, and such poems as "The Bolivar," "East and West," and above
  all the badly named "Envoi" became part of my very self. I always read the
  last one aloud to my little circle before we start on any fresh expedition,
  because it contains the very essence of travel, romance, and high
  adventure.</p>

  <p>I saw Kipling most nearly in his very early days when he lived at
  Brattleboro', a little village in Vermont, in a chivalrous desire to keep his
  newly married wife in touch with her own circle. In 1894, as I have recorded,
  there was a good deal of tail-twisting going on in the States, and Kipling
  pulled a few feathers out of the Eagle's tail in retaliation, which caused
  many screams of protest, for the American was far more sensitive to such
  things than the case-hardened Briton. I say "was," for I think as a nation
  with an increased assurance of their own worth and strength they are now more
  careless of criticism. The result at the time was to add oil to flames, and
  I, as a passionate believer in Anglo-American union, wrote to Kipling to
  remonstrate. He received my protest very good-humouredly, and it led to my
  visit to his country home. As a matter of fact, the concern shown in America,
  when the poet lay at death's door a few years later, showed that the rancour
  was not very deep. Perhaps he was better known at that time in America than
  in England, for I remember sitting beside a busman in London, who bowed his
  red face to my ear and said: "Beg your pardon, sir, but 'oo is this 'ere
  Kilpin?"</p>

  <p>I had two great days in Vermont, and have a grateful remembrance of Mrs.
  Kipling's hospitality. The poet read me "McAndrew's Hymn," which he had just
  done, and surprised me by his dramatic power which enabled him to sustain the
  Glasgow accent throughout, so that the angular Scottish greaser simply walked
  the room. I had brought up my golf clubs and gave him lessons in a field
  while the New England rustics watched us from afar, wondering what on earth
  we were at, for golf was unknown in America at that time. We parted good
  friends, and the visit was an oasis in my rather dreary pilgrimage as a
  lecturer.</p>

  <p>My glimpses of Kipling since then have been few and scattered, but I had
  the pleasure several times of meeting his old father, a most delightful and
  lovable person, who told a story quite as well as his famous son. As the
  mother was also a very remarkable woman, it is no wonder that he carried such
  a cargo.</p>

  <p>James Barrie is one of my oldest literary friends, and I knew him within a
  year or two of the time when we both came to London. He had just written his
  "Window in Thrums," and I, like all the world, acclaimed it. When I was
  lecturing in Scotland in 1893 he invited me to Kirriemuir, when I stayed some
  days with his family&mdash;splendid types of the folk who have made Scotland
  great. His father was a fine fellow, but his mother was wonderful with a head
  and a heart&mdash;rare combinations&mdash;which made me class her with my own
  mother. Kirriemuir could by no means understand Barrie's success, and looked
  upon their great son as an inexplicable phenomenon. They were acutely aware,
  however, that tourists were arriving from all parts to see the place on
  account of Barrie's books. "I suppose you have read them," I said to the wife
  of the local hotel man. "Aye, I've read them, and steep, steep, weary work it
  was," said she. She had some theory that it was a four-horse coach which her
  good man was running, and not the books at all which accounted for the
  boom.</p>

  <p>Great as are Barrie's plays&mdash;and some of them I think are very
  great&mdash;I wish he had never written a line for the theatre. The glamour
  of it and the&mdash;to him&mdash;easy success have diverted from literature
  the man with the purest style of his age. Plays are always ephemeral, however
  good, and are limited to a few, but Barrie's unborn books might have been an
  eternal and a universal asset of British literature. He has the chaste
  clarity which is the great style, which has been debased by a generation of
  wretched critics who have always confused what is clear with what is shallow,
  and what is turbid with what is profound. If a man's thought is precise, his
  rendering of it is precise, and muddy thoughts make obscure paragraphs. If I
  had to make my choice among modern stylists, I should pick Barrie for the
  lighter forms of expression and our British Winston Churchill for the more
  classical.</p>

  <p>Barrie's great play&mdash;one of the finest in the language&mdash;is of
  course "The Admirable Crichton." I shall always hope that I had a hand in the
  fashioning of it. I say this not in complaint but in satisfaction, for we all
  drop seeds into each other, and seldom know whence they come. We were walking
  together on the Heath at Kirriemuir when I said: "I had a quaint thought in
  the night, Barrie. It was that a king was visiting India and was wrecked on
  the way on some island far from the track of ships. Only he and one rather
  handy sailor were saved. They settled down to spend their lives together. Of
  course the result would be that the sailor would become the king and the king
  the subject." We chuckled over the idea, and when Crichton appeared, I seemed
  to see the fine plant which had grown from the tiny seed.</p>

  <p>Barrie and I had one unfortunate venture together, in which I may say that
  the misfortune was chiefly mine, since I had really nothing to do with the
  matter, and yet shared all the trouble. However, I should have shared the
  honour and profit in case of success, so that I have no right to grumble. The
  facts were that Barrie had promised Mr. D'Oyley Carte that he would provide
  the libretto of a light opera for the Savoy. This was in the Gilbert days,
  when such a libretto was judged by a very high standard. It was an
  extraordinary commission for him to accept, and I have never yet been able to
  understand why he did so, unless, like Alexander, he wanted fresh worlds to
  conquer. On this occasion, however, he met with a disastrous repulse, and the
  opera, "Jane Annie," to which I alluded in an early chapter, was one of the
  few failures in his brilliant career.</p>

  <p>I was brought into the matter because Barrie's health failed on account of
  some family bereavement. I had an urgent telegram from him at Aldburgh, and
  going there I found him very worried because he had bound himself by this
  contract, and he felt in his present state unable to go forward with it.
  There were to be two acts, and he had written the first one, and had the
  rough scenario of the second, with the complete sequence of events&mdash;if
  one may call it a sequence. Would I come in with him and help him to complete
  it as part author? Of course I was very happy to serve him in any way. My
  heart sank, however, when, after giving the promise, I examined the work. The
  only literary gift which Barrie has not got is the sense of poetic rhythm,
  and the instinct for what is permissible in verse. Ideas and wit were there
  in abundance. But the plot itself was not strong, though the dialogue and the
  situations also were occasionally excellent. I did my best and wrote the
  lyrics for the second act, and much of the dialogue, but it had to take the
  predestined shape. The result was not good. However, the actual comradeship
  of production was very amusing and interesting, and our failure was mainly
  painful to us because it let down the producer and the cast. We were well
  abused by the critics, but Barrie took it all in the bravest spirit.</p>

  <p>I find, in looking over my papers, a belated statement of account from
  Barrie which is good reading.</p><br>

  <p>Our association was never so closely renewed, but through all my changing
  life I have had a respect and affection for Barrie which were, I hope,
  mutual. How I collaborated with him at cricket as well as at work is told in
  my chapter on Sport.</p>

  <p>Henry Irving is one of the other great men whom I have met at close
  quarters, for his acting of Gregory Brewster brought us in contact. When he
  was producing "Coriolanus" he came down to Hindhead and used to drop in of an
  evening. He was fond of a glass of port&mdash;indeed, he was one of the four
  great men who were stated (probably untruly) by the Hon. G. Russell to drink
  a bottle each night&mdash;being the only trait which these great men had in
  common. The others, I remember, were Tennyson, Gladstone and Moses
  Montefiori, and the last I believe was really true. Like all bad habits, it
  overtook the sinner at last, and he was cut off at the age of 116.</p>

  <p>Irving had a curious dry wit which was occasionally sardonic and
  ill-natured. I can well believe that his rehearsals were often the occasion
  for heart-burnings among the men and tears among the ladies. The
  unexpectedness of his remarks took one aback. I remember when my friend
  Hamilton sat up with me into the "wee sma' hours" with the famous man, he
  became rather didactic on the subject of the Deity or the Universe or some
  other tremendous topic, which he treated very solemnly, and at great length.
  Irving sat with his intense eyes riveted upon the speaker's face, which
  encouraged Hamilton to go on and on. When at last he had finished, Irving
  remarked: "<i>What</i> a low comedian you would have made!" He wound up his
  visit by giving me his copy of "Coriolanus" with all his notes and stage
  directions&mdash;a very precious relic.</p>

  <p>Many visions of old times rise before my eyes as I write, but my book
  would lose all proportion should I dwell upon them. I see Henley, the
  formidable cripple, a red-bearded, loud-voiced buccaneer of a man who could
  only crawl, for his back appeared to be broken. He was a great poet and
  critic who seemed to belong to the roaring days of Marlowe of the mighty line
  and the pothouse fray. I see Haggard too, first as the young spruce
  diplomatist, later as the worn and bearded man with strange vague tendencies
  to mysticism. Shaw, too, I see with the pleasant silky voice and the biting
  phrase. It was strange that all the mild vegetables which formed his diet
  made him more pugnacious and, I must add, more uncharitable than the
  carnivorous man, so that I have known no literary man who was more ruthless
  to other people's feelings. And yet to meet him was always to like him. He
  could not resist a bitter jest or the perverted pleasure of taking up an
  unpopular attitude. As an example I remember Henry Irving telling me that
  when Shaw was invited to his father's funeral he wrote in reply: "If I were
  at Westminster Henry Irving would turn in his grave, just as Shakespeare
  would turn in his grave were Henry Irving at Stratford." I may not have it
  verbally exact, but that was near enough. It was the kind of outrageous thing
  that he would say. And yet one can forgive him all when one reads the
  glorious dialogue of some of his plays. He seems subhuman in emotion and
  superhuman in intellect.</p>

  <p>Shaw was always a thorn in Irving's side, and was usually the one jarring
  note among the chorus of praise which greeted each fresh production. At a
  first night at the Lyceum&mdash;those wonderful first nights which have never
  been equalled&mdash;the lanky Irishman with his greenish face, his red beard,
  and his sardonic expression must have been like the death's-head at the
  banquet to Irving. Irving ascribed this animosity to Shaw's pique because his
  plays were not accepted, but in this I am sure that he did an injustice. It
  was simply that contrary twist in the man which makes him delight in opposing
  whatever anyone else approved. There is nothing constructive in him, and he
  is bound to be in perpetual opposition. No one for example was stronger for
  peace and for non-militarism than he, and I remember that when I took the
  chair at a meeting at Hindhead to back up the Tsar's peace proposals at The
  Hague, I thought to myself as I spied Shaw in a corner of the room: "Well,
  this time at any rate he must be in sympathy." But far from being so he
  sprang to his feet and put forward a number of ingenious reasons why these
  proposals for peace would be disastrous. Do what you could he was always
  against you.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it is no bad thing to have the other point of view continually
  stated, and the British stand that sort of thing better than other nations.
  Had Shaw said in America what he said in England about the war whilst it was
  in progress he would have been in personal danger. There were times, however,
  when his queer contrary impulses became perfectly brutal in their working.
  One was at the time of the Titanic disaster, when he deliberately wrote a
  letter at a time when the wounds were raw, overwhelming every one concerned
  with bitter criticism. I was moved to write a remonstrance, and we had a
  sharp debate in public, which did not in any way modify our kindly personal
  relations. I can recall a smaller but even more unjustifiable example of his
  sour nature when he was staying at Hindhead. A garden-party had been got up
  for some charity, and it included the woodland scenes of "As You Like It,"
  which were done by amateurs, and very well done too. Shaw with no provocation
  wrote a whole column of abuse in the local paper, spattering all the actors
  and their performance with ridicule, and covering them with confusion, though
  indeed they had nothing to be ashamed of. One mentions these things as
  characteristic of one side of the man, and as a proof, I fear, that the
  adoption by the world of a vegetarian diet will not bring unkind thoughts or
  actions to an end. But with it all Shaw is a genial creature to meet, and I
  am pre-pared to believe that there is a human kindly side to his nature
  though it has not been presented to the public. It took a good man to write
  "Saint Joan."</p>

  <p>Wells, too, I have known long, and indeed I must have often entered the
  draper's shop in which he was employed at Southsea, for the proprietor was a
  patient of mine. Wells is one of the great fruits which popular education has
  given us, since he came, as he is proud to state, from the heart of the
  people. His democratic frankness and complete absence of class feeling are
  occasionally embarrassing. I remember his asking me once if I had played
  cricket at Liphook. I said that I had. He said: "Did you notice an old fellow
  who acts as professional and ground-keeper?" I said that I had. "That was my
  father," said Wells. I was too much surprised to answer, and could only
  congratulate myself that I had made no unpleasant comments before I knew the
  identity of the old man.</p>

  <p>I have always had my doubts as to those elaborate forecasts of the future
  in which Wells indulges. He has, it is true, made a couple of good shots
  which have already materialized in the tanks and in the machine which would
  deliver news in our own houses. But he has never shown any perception of the
  true meaning of the psychic, and for want of it his history of the world,
  elaborate and remarkable as it was, seemed to me to be a body without a soul.
  However, this also may be given him, and it will make his equipment complete.
  I remember discussing the matter with him, when George Gissing, Hornung, he
  and I foregathered in Rome early in this century, but apparently my words had
  no effect.</p>

  <p>Willie Hornung, my brother-in-law, is another of my vivid memories. He was
  a Dr. Johnson without the learning but with a finer wit. No one could say a
  neater thing, and his writings, good as they are, never adequately
  represented the powers of the man, nor the quickness of his brain. These
  things depend upon the time and the fashion, and go flat in the telling, but
  I remember how, when I showed him the record of some one who claimed to have
  done 100 yards under ten seconds, he said: "It is a sprinter's error." Golf
  he could not abide, for he said it was "unsportsmanlike to hit a sitting
  ball." His criticism upon my Sherlock Holmes was: "Though he might be more
  humble, there is no police like Holmes." I think I may claim that his famous
  character Raffles was a kind of inversion of Sherlock Holmes, Bunny playing
  Watson. He admits as much in his kindly dedication. I think there are few
  finer examples of short-story writing in our language than these, though I
  confess I think they are rather dangerous in their suggestion. I told him so
  before he put pen to paper, and the result has, I fear, borne me out. You
  must not make the criminal a hero.</p>

  <p>Jerome, too, is an old friend. He is an adventurous soul, and at one time
  started a four-in-hand. I remember sitting on the top of it, and when one of
  the leaders turned right round and took a good look at the driver I thought
  it was time to get down. Maxwell also is an old friend. He is, of course, the
  son of Miss Braddon, who married a publisher of that name. I respect him for
  doing a man's work in the war when, though he was fifty years of age, and had
  led a sedentary life, he volunteered for a fighting battalion, a credit which
  he shares with A. E. W. Mason. Maxwell's work has always greatly appealed to
  me, and I have long looked upon him as the greatest novelist that we
  possess.</p>

  <p>I never met Robert Louis Stevenson in the flesh, though I owe so much to
  him in the literary spirit. Never can I forget the delight with which I read
  those early stories of his in the "Cornhill," before I knew the name of the
  author. I still think that "The Pavilion on the Links" is one of the great
  short stories of the world, though there were alterations in the final form
  which were all for the worse, and showed prudery upon the part of the
  publishers. Stevenson's last year at Edinburgh University must have just
  about coincided with my first one, and Barrie must also have been in that
  grey old nest of learning about the year 1876. Strange to think that I
  probably brushed elbows with both of them in the crowded portal.</p>

  <p>From his far-away home in Samoa he seemed to keep a quick eye upon
  literary matters in England, and I had most encouraging letters from him in
  1893 and 1894. "O frolic fellow-spookist" was his curious term of personal
  salutation in one of these, which showed that he shared my interest in
  psychic research but did not take it very seriously. I cannot guess how at
  that time he had detected it, though I was aware that he had himself in early
  days acted as secretary to a psychic research or rather to a spiritualist
  society in Edinburgh, which studied the remarkable mediumship of Duguid. His
  letters to me consisted of kind appreciation of my work. "I have a great
  talent for compliment," he said, "accompanied by a hateful, even a diabolic,
  frankness." He had been retailing some of my Sherlock Holmes yarns to his
  native servants&mdash;I should not have thought that he needed to draw upon
  anyone else&mdash;and he complained to me in a comical letter of the
  difficulty of telling a story when you had to halt every moment to explain
  what a railway was, what an engineer was, and so forth. He got the story
  across in spite of all difficulties, and, said he, "If you could have seen
  the bright feverish eyes of Simite you would have tasted glory." But he
  explained that the natives took everything literally, and that there was no
  such thing as an imaginary story for them. "I, who write this, have had the
  indiscretion to perpetaate a trifling piece of fiction, 'The Bottle Imp.
  Parties who come up to visit my mansion, after having admired the ceiling by
  Vanderputty and the tapestry by Gobbling, manifest towards the end a certain
  uneasiness which proves them to be fellows of an infinite delicacy. They may
  be seen to shrug a brown shoulder, to roll up a speaking eye, and at last the
  secret bursts from them: 'Where is the bottle?' "In another letter he said
  that as I had written of my first book in the "Idler" he also would do so. "I
  could not hold back where the white plume of Conan Doyle waved in front of
  me." So, at least, I may boast that it is to me that the world owes the
  little personal sketch about "Treasure Island" which appeared in that year. I
  cannot forget the shock that it was to me when driving down the Strand in a
  hansom cab in 1896 I saw upon a yellow evening poster "Death of Stevenson."
  Some-thing seemed to have passed out of my world.</p>

  <p>I was asked by his executors to finish the novel "St. Ives," which he had
  left three-quarters completed, but I did not feel equal to the task. It was
  done, however, and, I understand, very well done, by Quiller-Couch. It is a
  desperately difficult thing to carry on another man's story, and must be a
  more or less mechanical effort. I had one experience of it when my neighbour
  at Hindhead, Grant Allen, was on his death-bed. He was much worried because
  there were two numbers of his serial, "Hilda Wade," which was running in "The
  Strand" magazine, still uncompleted. It was a pleasure for me to do them for
  him, and so relieve his mind, but it was difficult collar work, and I expect
  they were pretty bad. Some time afterwards a stranger, who evidently confused
  Allen and me, wrote to say that his wife had given him a baby girl, and that
  in honour of me he was calling her Hilda Wade. He was really nearer the truth
  than appeared at first sight.</p>

  <p>I well remember that death-bed of Grant Allen's. He was an agnostic of a
  type which came very near atheism, though in his private life an amiable and
  benevolent man. Believing what he did, the approach of death must have
  offered rather a bleak prospect, and as he had paroxysms of extreme pain the
  poor fellow seemed very miserable. I had often argued the case with him, I
  from a Theistic and he from a negative point of view, but I did not intrude
  my opinions or disturb his mind at that solemn moment. Death-bed changes,
  though some clergy may rejoice in them, are really vain things. His brain,
  however, was as clear as ever, and his mind was occupied with all manner of
  strange knowledge, which he imparted in the intervals of his pain, in the
  curious high nasal voice which was characteristic. I can see him now, his
  knees drawn up to ease internal pain, and his long thin nose and reddish-grey
  goatee protruding over the sheet, while he creaked out: "Byzantine art, my
  dear Doyle, was of three periods, the middle one roughly coinciding with the
  actual fall of the Roman Empire. The characteristics of the first
  period&mdash;&mdash;" and so on, until he would give a cry, clasp his hands
  across his stomach, and wait till the pain passed before resuming his
  lecture. His dear little wife nursed him devotedly, and mitigated the gloom
  of those moments which can be made the very happiest in life if one
  understands what lies before one. One thinks, as a contrast, of Dr. Hodgson's
  impatient cry, "I can hardly wait for death!"</p>

  <p>Grant Allen's strong opinions in print, and a certain pleasure he took in
  defending outside positions, gave quite a false view of his character, which
  was gentle and benignant. I remember his coming to a fancy dress ball which
  we gave in the character of a Cardinal, and in that guise all the quiet
  dignity of the man seemed to come out and you realized how much our
  commonplace modern dress disguises the real man. He used to tell with great
  amusement how a couple, who afterwards became close friends, came first to
  call, and how as they waited on the doorstep the wife said to the husband:
  "Remember, John, if he openly blasphemes, I leave the room." He had, I
  remember, very human relations with the maids who took a keen interest in
  their employer's scientific experiments. On one occasion these were connected
  with spiders, and the maid rushed into the drawing-room and cried: "Oh, sir,
  Araminta has got a wasp." Araminta was the name given to the big spider which
  he was observing at the time.</p>

  <p>Grant Allen had no actual call to write fiction, but his brain was agile
  enough to make some sort of job of anything to which it turned. On the other
  hand, as a popular scientist he stood alone, or shared the honour with Samuel
  Laing. His only real success in fiction was the excellent short story John
  Creedy, where he combined science with fiction, with remarkable results.</p>

  <p>At the time when I and so many others turned to letters there was
  certainly a wonderful vacancy for the new-comer. The giants of old had all
  departed. Thackeray, Dickens, Charles Reade and Trollope were memories. There
  was no great figure remaining save Hardy rising. The novelist was Mrs.
  Humphrey Ward, who was just beginning her career with "Robert Elsmere," the
  first of that series of novels which will illuminate the later Victorian era
  more clearly than any historian ever can do. I think it was Hodgkin who said,
  when he read "Count Robert of Paris ": "Here have I been studying Byzantium
  all my life, and I never understood it until this blessed Scotch lawyer came
  along." That is the special prerogative of imagination. Trollope and Mrs.
  Ward have the whole Victorian civilization dissected and preserved.</p>

  <p>Then there were Meredith, unintelligible to most, and Walter Besant. There
  was Wilkie Collins, too, with his fine stories of mystery, and finally there
  was James Payn.</p>

  <p>Payn was much greater than his books. The latter were usually rather
  mechanical, but to get at the real man one has to read such articles as his
  "Literary Reminiscences," and especially his "Backwater of Life."</p>

  <p>He had all that humorous view which Nature seems to give as a compensation
  to those whose strength is weak. Had Payn written only essays he would have
  rivalled Charles Lamb. I knew him best in his latter days, when he was
  crippled with illness, and his poor fingers so twisted with rheumatic
  arthritis that they seemed hardly human. He was intensely pessimistic as to
  his own fate. "Don't make any mistake, Doyle, death is a horrible
  thing&mdash;horrible! I suffer the agonies of the damned!" But five minutes
  later he would have his audience roaring with laughter, and his own high
  treble laugh would be the loudest of all.</p>

  <p>His own ailments were frequently a source of mirth. I remember how he
  described the breaking of a blood-vessel in Bournemouth and how they carried
  him home on a litter. He was dimly conscious of the fir-woods through which
  he passed. "I thought it was my funeral, and that they had done me well in
  the matter of plumes." When he told a story he was so carried away by his
  sense of humour that he could hardly get the end out, and he finished up in a
  kind of scream. An American had called upon him at some late hour and had
  discoursed upon Assyrian tablets. "I thought they were something to eat," he
  screamed. He was an excellent whist player, and the Baldwin Club used to send
  three members to his house on certain days so that the old fellow should not
  go without his game. This game was very scientific. He would tell with
  delight how he asked some novice: "Do you play the penultimate?" To which the
  novice answered: "No&mdash;but my brother plays the American organ."</p>

  <p>Many of my generation of authors had reason to love him, for he was a
  human and kindly critic. His writing however, was really dreadful. It was of
  him that the story was told than an author handed one of his letters to a
  chemist for a test. The chemist retired for a time and then returned with a
  bottle and demanded half a crown. Better luck attended the man who received
  an illegible letter from a railway director. He used it as a free pass upon
  the line. Payn used to joke about his own writing, but it was a very real
  trouble when one could not make out whether he had accepted or rejected one's
  story. There was one letter in which I could only read the words
  "infringement of copyright." He was very funny when he described the work of
  the robust younger school. "I have received a story from&mdash;&mdash;" he
  said, "5,000 words, mostly damns."</p>

  <p>I knew Sir Henry Thompson, the famous surgeon, very well, and was
  frequently honoured by an invitation to his famous octave dinners, at which
  eight carefully chosen male guests were always the company. They always
  seemed to me to be the most wonderful exhibitions of unselfishness, for
  Thompson was not allowed any alcohol, or anything save the most simple
  viands. Possibly, however, like Meredith and the bottle of burgundy, he
  enjoyed some reflex pleasure from-the enjoyment of others. He had been a
  wonderful <i>viveur</i> and judge of what was what, and I fear that I
  disappointed him, for I was much more interested in the conversation than the
  food, and it used to annoy me when some argument was interrupted in order to
  tell us that it was not ordinary ham but a Westphalian wild boar that we were
  eating and that it had been boiled in wine for precisely the right time
  prescribed by the best authorities. But it was part of his wonderful
  unselfish hospitality to make his guests realize exactly what it was that was
  set before them. I have never heard more interesting talk than at these male
  gatherings, for it is notorious that though ladies greatly improve the
  appearance of a feast they usually detract from the quality of the talk. Few
  men are ever absolutely natural when there are women in the room.</p>

  <p>There was one special dinner, I fancy it was the hundredth of the series,
  which was particularly interest-ing as the Prince of Wales, now George V, was
  one of the eight, and gave us a most interesting account of the voyage round
  the world from which he had just returned. Of the rest of the company I can
  only recall Sir Henry Stanley, the traveller, and Sir Crichton Browne. Twenty
  years later I met the King when he visited a trade exhibition, and I attended
  as one of the directors of Tuck's famous postcard firm. He at once said:
  "Why, I have not seen you since that pleasant dinner when you sat next to me
  at Sir Henry Thompson's." It seemed to me to be a remarkable example of the
  royal gift of memory.</p>

  <p>I have not often occupied a chair among the seats of the mighty. My life
  has been too busy and too preoccupied to allow me to stray far from my beaten
  path. The mention of the Prince, however, reminds me of the one occasion when
  I was privileged to entertain&mdash;or to attempt to entertain&mdash;the
  present Queen. It was at a small dinner to which I was invited by the
  courtesy of Lord Midleton whose charming wife, once Madeleine Stanley
  daughter of Lady Helier, I could remember since her girlhood. Upon this
  occasion the Prince and Princess came in after dinner, the latter sitting
  alone at one end of the room with a second chair beside her own, which was
  occupied successively by the various gentlemen who were to be introduced to
  her. I was led up in due course, made my bow, and sat down at her request. I
  confess that I found it heavy going at first, for I had heard somewhere that
  Royalty has to make the first remark, and had it been the other way there was
  such a gulf between us that I should not have known where to begin. However
  she was very pleasant and gracious and began asking me some questions about
  my works which brought me on to very easy ground. Indeed, I became so
  interested in our talk that I was quite disappointed when Mr. John Morley was
  led up, and I realized that it was time for me to vacate the chair.</p>

  <p>There was another amusing incident on that eventful evening. I had been
  asked to take in Lady Curzon, whose husband, then Viceroy of India, had been
  unable to attend. The first couple had passed in and there was a moment's
  hesitation as to who should go next, but Lady Curzon and I were nearest the
  door, so possibly with some little encouragement from the lady we filed
  through. I thought nothing of the incident but some great authority upon
  these matters came to me afterwards in great excitement. "Do you know," he
  said, "that you have established a precedent and solved one of the most
  difficult and debatable matters of etiquette that has ever caused ill-feeling
  in British Society?" "The Lord Chancellor and the College of Heralds should
  be much obliged to you, for you have given them a definite lead. There has
  never been so vexed a question as to whether a Vice-reine when she is away
  from the country where she represents royalty shall take precedence over a
  Duchess. There was a Duchess in the room, but you by your decided action have
  settled the matter for ever." So who shall say that I have done nothing in my
  life?</p>

  <p>Of the distinguished lights of the law whom I have met from time to time I
  think that Sir Henry Hawkins&mdash;then become Lord Bampton&mdash;made the
  most definite impression. I met him at a week-end gathering at Cliveden, when
  Mr. Astor was our host. On the first night at dinner, before the party had
  shaken down into mutual acquaintance, the ex-judge, very old and as bald as
  an ostrich egg, was seated opposite, and was wreathed with smiles as he made
  himself agreeable to his neighbour. His appearance was so jovial that I
  remarked to the lady upon my left: "It is curious to notice the appearance of
  our vis-â-vis and to contrast it with his reputation," alluding to his
  sinister record as an inexorable judge. She seemed rather puzzled by my
  remark, so I added: "Of course you know who he is." "Yes," said she, "his
  name is Conan Doyle and he writes novels." I was hardly middle-aged at the
  time and at my best physically, so that I was amused at her mistake, which
  arose from some confusion in the list of guests. I put my dinner card up
  against her wine-glass, so after that we got to know each other.</p>

  <p>Hawkins was a most extraordinary man, and so capricious that one never
  knew whether one was dealing with Jekyll or with Hyde. It was certainly Hyde
  when he took eleven hours summing up in the Penge case, and did all a man
  could do to have all four of the prisoners condemned to death. Sir Edward
  Clarke was so incensed at his behaviour on this occasion that he gave notice
  when Hawkins retired from the bench that if there were the usual
  complimentary ceremonies he would protest. So they were dropped.</p>

  <p>I might, on the other hand, illustrate the Jekyll side of him by a story
  which he told me with his own lips.</p>

  <p>A prisoner had a pet mouse. One day the brute of a warder deliberately
  trod upon it. The prisoner caught up his dinner knife and dashed at the
  warder, who only just escaped, the knife stabbing the door as it closed
  behind him. Hawkins as judge wanted to get the man off, but the attempt at
  murder was obvious and the law equally clear. What was he to do? In his
  charge to the jury he said: "If a man tries to kill another in a way which is
  on the face of it absurd, it becomes a foolish rather than a criminal act.
  If, for example, a man in London discharged a pistol to hurt a man in
  Edinburgh, we could only laugh at such an offence. So also when a man stabs
  an iron-plated door while another man is at the other side of it we cannot
  take it seriously." The jury, who were probably only too glad to follow such
  a lead, brought in a verdict of "Not guilty."</p>

  <p>Another distinguished man of the law who left a very clear impression upon
  my mind was Sir Francis Jeune, afterwards Lord St. Helier. I attended several
  of Lady Jeune's famous luncheon parties, which were quite one of the
  outstanding institutions of London, like Gladstone's breakfasts in the last
  quarter of the nineteenth century. I am indebted to this lady for very many
  kind actions. Her husband always impressed me with his gentle wisdom and with
  his cultivated taste. He told me that if every copy of Horace were destroyed
  he thought that he could reconstruct most of it from memory. He presided over
  the Divorce Courts, and I remember upon one occasion I said to him: "You must
  have a very low opinion of human nature, Sir Francis, since the worst side of
  it is for ever presented towards you." "On the contrary," said he very
  earnestly, "my experience in the Divorce Courts has greatly raised my opinion
  of humanity. There is so much chivalrous self-sacrifice, and so much
  disposition upon the part of every one to make the best of a bad business
  that it is extremely edifying." This view seemed to me to be worth
  recording.</p>

  <p class="first">IT is here&mdash;before we approach what Maxwell has called
  "The Great Interruption"&mdash;that I may perhaps break my narrative in order
  to interpolate a chapter upon the general subject of my experiences of sport,
  which have taken up an appreciable part of my life, added greatly to its
  pleasure, and which can be better treated as a whole than recounted seriatim.
  It may best be fitted in at this spot as my sporting life one way and another
  may be said to have reached its modest zenith about that time.</p>

  <p>As one grows old one looks back at one's career in sport as a thing
  completed. Yet I have at least held on to it as long as I could, for I played
  a hard match of Association football at forty-four, and I played cricket for
  ten years more. I have never specialized, and have therefore been a
  second-rater in all things. I have made up for it by being an all-rounder,
  and have had, I dare say, as much fun out of sport as many an adept. It would
  be odd if a man could try as many games as I for so many years without having
  some interesting experiences or forming a few opinions which would bear
  recording and discussion.</p>

  <p>And first of all let me "damn the sins I have no mind to" by recording
  what most of my friends will regard as limitation. I never could look upon
  flat-racing as a true sport. Sport is what a man does, not what a horse does.
  Skill and judgment are shown, no doubt, by the professional jockeys, but I
  think it may be argued that in nine cases out of ten the best horse wins, and
  would have equally won, could his head be kept straight, had there been a
  dummy on his back.</p>

  <p>But making every allowance, on the one side, for what human qualities may
  be called forth, and for any improvement of the breed of horses (though I am
  told that the same pains in other directions would produce infinitely more
  fruitful and generally useful results), and putting on the other side the
  demoralization from betting, the rascality among some book-makers, and the
  collection of undesirable characters brought together by a race meeting, I
  cannot avoid the conclusion that the harm greatly outweighs the good from a
  broadly national point of view. Yet I recognize, of course, that it is an
  amusement which lies so deeply in human nature&mdash;the oldest, perhaps, of
  all amusements which have come down to us&mdash;that it must have its place
  in our system until the time may come when it will be gradually modified,
  developing, perhaps, some purifying change, as prize-fighting did when it
  turned to contests with the gloves.</p>

  <p>I have purposely said "flat-racing," because I think a stronger case,
  though not, perhaps, an entirely sound one, could be made out for
  steeple-chasing. Eliminate the mob and the money, and then, surely, among
  feats of human skill and hardihood there are not many to match that of the
  winner of a really stiff point-to-point, while the man who rides at the huge
  barriers of the Grand National has a heart for anything. As in the old days
  of the ring, it is not the men nor the sport, but it is the followers who
  cast a shadow on, the business. Go down to Waterloo and meet any returning
  race train, if you doubt it.</p>

  <p>If I have alienated half my readers by my critical attitude to the Turf, I
  shall probably offend the other half by stating that I cannot persuade myself
  that we are justified in taking life as a pleasure. To shoot for the pot must
  be right, since man must feed, and to kill creatures which live upon others
  (the hunting of foxes, for example) must also be right, since to slay one is
  to save many; but the rearing of birds in order to kill them, and the
  shooting of such sensitive and inoffensive animals as hares and deer, cannot,
  I think, be justified. I must admit that I shot a good deal before I came to
  this conclusion. Perhaps the fact, while it prevents my assuming any airs of
  virtue, will give my opinion greater weight, since good shooting is still
  within my reach, and I know nothing more exhilarating than to wait on the
  borders of an autumn-tinted wood, to hear the crackling advance of beaters,
  to mark the sudden whirr and the yell of "Mark over," and then, over the
  topmost branches, to see a noble cock pheasant whizzing down wind at a pace
  which pitches him a 100 yards behind you when you have dropped him. But when
  your moment of exultation is over, and you note what a beautiful creature he
  is and how one instant of your pleasure has wrecked him, you feel that you
  had better think no longer if you mean to slip two more cartridges into your
  gun and stand by for another. Worse still is it when you hear the child-like
  wail of the wounded hare. I should think that there are few sportsmen who
  have not felt a disgust at their own handiwork when they have heard it. So,
  too, when you see the pheasant fly on with his legs showing beneath him as
  sign that he is hard hit. He drops into the thick woods and is lost to sight.
  Perhaps it is as well for your peace of mind that he should be lost to
  thought also.</p>

  <p>Of course, one is met always by the perfectly valid argument that the
  creatures would not live at all if it were not for the purposes of sport, and
  that it is presumably better from their point of view that they should
  eventually meet a violent death than that they should never have existed. No
  doubt this is true. But there is another side of the question as to the
  effect of the sport upon ourselves&mdash;whether it does not blunt our own
  better feelings, harden our sympathies, brutalize our natures. A coward can
  do it as well as a brave man; a weakling can do it as well as a strong man.
  There is no ultimate good from it. Have we a moral right then, to kill
  creatures for amusement? I know many of the best and most kind-hearted men
  who do it, but still I feel that in a more advanced age it will no longer be
  possible.</p>

  <p>And yet I am aware of my own inconsistency when I say I am in sympathy
  with fishing, and would gladly have a little if I knew where to get it. And
  yet, is it wholly inconsistent? Is a cold-blooded creature of low
  organization like a fish to be regarded in the same way as the hare which
  cries out in front of the beagles, or the deer which may carry the rifle
  bullet away in its side? If there is any cruelty it is surely of a much less
  degree. Besides, is it not the sweet solitude of Nature, the romantic quest,
  rather than the actual capture which appeals to the fisherman? One thinks of
  the stories of trout and salmon which have taken another fly within a few
  minutes of having broken away from a former one, and one feels that their
  sense of pain must be very different from our own.</p>

  <p>I once had the best of an exchange of fishing stories, which does not
  sound like a testimonial to my veracity. It was in a Birmingham inn, and a
  commercial traveller was boasting of his successes. I ventured to back the
  weight of the last three fish which I had been concerned in catching against
  any day's take of his lifetime. He closed with the bet and quoted some large
  haul, 100 lbs. or more. "Now, sir," he asked triumphantly, "what was the
  weight of your three fish?" "Just over 200 tons," I answered. "Whales?" "Yes,
  three Greenland whales." "I give you best," he cried; but whether as a
  fisherman, or as a teller of fish stories, I am not sure. As a matter of
  fact, I had only returned that year from the Arctic seas, and the three fish
  in question were, in truth, the last which I had helped to catch.</p>

  <p>My experiences during my Arctic voyage both with whales and bears I have
  already touched upon, so I will not refer to them again, though it was the
  greatest period of sport which has ever come my way.</p>

  <p>I have always been keen upon the noble old English sport of boxing, and,
  though of no particular class myself, I suppose I might describe my form as
  that of a fair average amateur. I should have been a better man had I taught
  less and learned more, but after my first tuition I had few chances of
  professional teaching. However, I have done a good deal of mixed boxing among
  many different types of men, and had as much pleasure from it as from any
  form of sport. It stood me in good stead aboard the whaler. On the very first
  evening I had a strenuous bout with the steward, who was an excellent
  sportsman. I heard him afterwards, through the partition of the cabin,
  declare that I was "the best sur-r-r-geon we've had, Colin&mdash;he's blacked
  my ee." It struck me as a singular test of my medical ability, but I dare say
  it did no harm.</p>

  <p>I remember when I was a medical practitioner going down to examine a man's
  life for insurance in a little Sussex village. He was the gentleman farmer of
  the place, and a most sporting and jovial soul. It was a Saturday, and I
  enjoyed his hospitality that evening, staying over till Monday. After
  breakfast it chanced that several neighbours dropped in, one of whom, an
  athletic young farmer, was fond of the gloves. Conversation soon brought out
  the fact that I had a weakness in the same direction. The result was obvious.
  Two pairs of gloves were hunted from some cupboard, and in a few minutes we
  were hard at it, playing light at first and letting out as we warmed. It was
  soon clear that there was no room inside a house for two heavy-weights, so we
  adjourned to the front lawn. The main road ran across the end of it, with a
  low wall of just the right height to allow the village to rest its elbows on
  it and enjoy the spectacle. We fought several very brisk rounds, with no
  particular advantage either way, but the contest always stands out in my
  memory for its queer surroundings and the old English picture in which it was
  set. It is one of several curious bye-battles in my career. I recollect
  another where another man and I, returning from a ball at five of a summer
  morning, went into his room and fought in our dress clothes several very
  vigorous rounds as a wind-up to the evening's exercise.</p>

  <p>They say that every form of knowledge comes useful sooner or later.
  Certainly my own experience in boxing and my very large acquaintance with the
  history of the prize-ring found their scope when I wrote "Rodney Stone." No
  one but a fighting man would ever, I think, quite understand or appreciate
  some of the detail. A friend of mine read the scene where Boy Jim fights
  Berks to a prize-fighter as he lay in what proved to be his last illness. The
  man listened with growing animation until the reader came to the point where
  the second advises Boy Jim, in technical jargon, how to get at his awkward
  antagonist. "That's it! By God, he's got him!" shouted the man in the bed. It
  was an incident which gave me pleasure when I heard it.</p>

  <p>I have never concealed my opinion that the old prize-ring was an excellent
  thing from a national point of view&mdash;exactly as glove-fighting is now.
  Better that our sports should be a little too rough than that we should run a
  risk of effeminacy. But the ring outlasted its time. It was ruined by the
  villainous mobs who cared nothing for the chivalry of sport or the traditions
  of British fair play as compared with the money gain which the contest might
  bring. Their blackguardism drove out the good men&mdash;the men who really
  did uphold the ancient standards, and so the whole institution passed into
  rottenness and decay. But now the glove contests carried on under the
  discipline of the National Sporting or other clubs perpetuate the noble old
  sport without a possibility of the more evil elements creeping into it once
  more. An exhibition of hardihood without brutality, of good-humoured courage
  without savagery, of skill without trickery, is, I think, the very highest
  which sport can give. People may smile at the mittens, but a twenty-round
  contest with four-ounce gloves is quite as punishing an ordeal as one could
  wish to endure. There is as little room for a coward as in the rougher days
  of old, and the standard of endurance is probably as high as in the average
  prize-fight.</p>

  <p>One wonders how our champions of to-day would have fared at the hands of
  the heroes of the past. I know something of this end of the question, for I
  have seen nearly all the great boxers of my time, from J. L. Sullivan down to
  Tommy Burns, Carpentier, Bombardier Wells, Beckett and that little miracle
  Jimmy Wilde. But how about the other end&mdash;the men of old? Wonderful Jem
  Mace was the only link between them. On the one hand, he was supreme in the
  'sixties as a knuckle-fighter; on the other, he gave the great impetus to
  glove-fighting in America, and more especially in Australia, which has
  brought over such champions as Frank Slavin and Fitzsimmons, who, through
  Mace's teaching, derive straight from the classic line of British boxers. He
  of all men might have drawn a just comparison between the old and the new.
  But even his skill and experience might be at fault, for it is notorious that
  many of the greatest fighters under the old régime were poor hands with the
  mittens. Men could bang poor Tom Sayers all round the ring with the gloves,
  who would not have dared to get over the ropes had he been without them. I
  have seen Mace box, and even when over sixty it is wonderful how straight was
  his left, how quick his feet, and how impregnable his guard.</p>

  <p>After the Great War, one can see that those of us who worked for the
  revival of boxing wrought better than we knew, for at the supreme test of all
  time&mdash;the test which has settled the history of the future&mdash;it has
  played a marked part. I do not mean that a man used his fists in the war, but
  I mean&mdash;and every experienced instructor will, I am sure, endorse
  it&mdash;that the combative spirit and aggressive quickness gave us the
  attacking fire and helped especially in bayonet work. But it was to our
  allies of France that the chief advantage came. I believe that Carpentier,
  the boxer, did more to win the war for France than any other man save the
  actual generals or politicians. The public proof that a Frenchman could be at
  the very head of his class, as Ledoux was also at a lighter weight, gives a
  physical self-respect to a nation which tinges the spirit of every single
  member of it. It was a great day for France when English sports, boxing,
  Rugby football and others came across to them, and when a young man's ideal
  ceased to be amatory adventure with an occasional duel. England has taught
  Europe much, but nothing of more value than this.</p>

  <p>To return to my own small experiences of the game, I might have had one
  very notable one, for I was asked to referee the great contest when the
  champions of the white and black races fought for what may prove to be almost
  the last time.</p>

  <p>My first intimation was a cable followed by the following
  letter:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">NEW YORK,<br>
  <i>December</i> 9, 1909.<br>
  <br>
  MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  I hope you will pardon the liberty I took as a stranger in cabling to you
  asking if you would act at the championship battle between Jeffries and
  Johnson. The fact is that when the articles were signed recently your name
  was suggested for referee, and Tex Rickard, promoter of the fight, was
  greatly interested, as were many others. I believe it will interest you to
  know that the opinion was unanimous that you would do admirably in the
  position. In a voting contest several persons sent in your name as their
  choice. Believe me among sporting men of the best class in America you have
  many strong admirers; your splendid stories of the ring, and your avowed
  admiration for the great sport of boxing have made you thousands of
  friends.<br>
  <br>
  It was because of this extremely friendly feeling for you in America that I
  took the liberty of cabling to you. I thank you for your reply.<br>
  <br>
  It would indeed rejoice the hearts of the men in this country if you were at
  the ring side when the great negro fighter meets the white man Jeffries for
  the world's championship.<br>
  <br>
  I am, my dear Sir,<br>
  Yours sincerely,<br>
  IRVING JEFFERSON LEWIS,<br>
  Managing Editor New York Morning Telegraph.</p>

  <p>I was much inclined to accept this honourable invitation, though my
  friends pictured me as winding up with a revolver at one ear and a razor at
  the other. However, the distance and my engagements presented a final
  bar.</p>

  <p>If boxing is the finest single man sport, I think that Rugby football is
  the best collective one. Strength, courage, speed and resource are great
  qualities to include in a single game. I have always wished that it had come
  more my way in life, but my football was ruined, as many a man's is, by the
  fact that at my old school they played a hybrid game peculiar to the place,
  with excellent points of its own, but unfitting the youngster for any other.
  All these local freak games, wall games, Winchester games, and so on are
  national misfortunes, for while our youths are wasting their energies upon
  them&mdash;those precious early energies which make the instinctive
  players&mdash;the young South African or New Zealander is brought up on the
  real universal Rugby, and so comes over to pluck a few more laurel leaves out
  of our depleted wreath. In Australia I have seen in Victoria a hybrid, though
  excellent game of their own, but they have had the sense in other parts to
  fall into line, and are already taking the same high position which they hold
  in other branches of sport. I hope that our headmasters will follow the same
  course.</p>

  <p>In spite of my wretched training I played for a short time as a forward in
  the Edinburgh University team, but my want of knowledge of the game was too
  heavy a handicap. Afterwards I took to Association, and played first goal and
  then back for Portsmouth, when that famous club was an amateur organization.
  Even then we could put a very fair team in the field, and were runners-up for
  the County Cup the last season that I played. In the same season I was
  invited to play for the county. I was always too slow, however, to be a
  really good back, though I was a long and safe kick. After a long hiatus I
  took up football again in South Africa and organized a series of
  inter-hospital matches in Bloemfontein which helped to take our minds away
  from enteric. My old love treated me very scurvily, however, for I received a
  foul from a man's knee which buckled two of my ribs and brought my games to a
  close. I have played occasionally since, but there is no doubt that as a man
  grows older a brisk charge shakes him up as it never did before. Let him turn
  to golf, and be thankful that there is still one splendid game which can
  never desert him. There may be objections to the "Royal and
  Ancient"&mdash;but a game which takes four miles of country for the playing
  must always have a majesty of its own.</p>

  <p>Personally I was an enthusiastic, but a very inefficient golfer&mdash;a
  ten at my best, and at my worst outside the pale of all decent handicaps. But
  surely it is a great testimony to the qualities of a game when a man can be
  both enthusiastic and inefficient. It is a proof at least that a man plays
  for the game's sake and not for personal kudos. Golf is the coquette of
  games. It always lures one on and always evades one. Ten years ago I thought
  I had nearly got it. I hope so to-day. But my scoring cards will show, I
  fear, that the coquette has not yet been caught. The elderly lover cannot
  hope to win her smile.</p>

  <p>I used in my early golfing days to practise on the very rudimentary links
  in front of the Mena Hotel, just under the Pyramids. It was a weird course,
  where, if you sliced your ball, you might find it bunkered in the grave of
  some Rameses or Thothmes of old. It was here, I believe, that the cynical
  stranger, after watching my energetic but ineffectual game, remarked that he
  had always understood that there was a special tax for excavating in Egypt. I
  have a pleasant recollection of Egyptian golf in a match played with the late
  Sirdar, then head of the Intelligence Department. When my ball was teed I
  observed that his negro caddie pointed two fingers at it and spat, which
  meant, as I was given to understand, that he cursed it for the rest of the
  game. Certainly I got into every hazard in the course, though I must admit
  that I have accomplished that when there was no Central African curse upon
  me.</p>

  <p>Those were the days before the reconquest of the Soudan, and I was told by
  Colonel Wingate&mdash;as he then was&mdash;that his spies coming down from
  Omdurman not infrequently delivered their messages to him while carrying his
  golf clubs, to avoid the attention of the Calipha's spies, who abounded in
  Cairo. On this occasion the Sirdar beat me well, but with a Christian caddie
  I turned the tables on him at Dunbar, and now we have signed articles to play
  off the rubber at Khartoum, no cursing allowed. When that first match was
  played we should as soon have thought of arranging to play golf in the
  moon.</p>

  <p>Every now and then I give up the game in disgust at my own incompetence,
  but only to be lured on once more. Hunting in an old desk I came upon an
  obituary which I had written for my game at some moment of special
  depression. It ran, "Sacred to the memory of my golf. It was never strong,
  being permanently afflicted with a deformed stance and an undeveloped swing.
  After long weakness cheerfully borne it finally succumbed, and was buried in
  the eighteenth hole, regretted by numerous caddies." However it is out and
  about once more, none the worse for this premature interment.</p>

  <p>There is said to be a considerable analogy between golf and billiards, so
  much so that success in the one generally leads to success in the other.
  Personally, I have not found it so, for though I may claim, I suppose, to be
  above the average amateur at billiards, I am probably below him in golf. I
  have never quite attained the three-figure break, but I have so often topped
  the eighty, and even the ninety, that I have lived in constant hope. My
  friend, the late General Drayson, who was a great authority on the game, used
  to recommend that every player should ascertain what he called his "decimal,"
  by which he meant how many innings it took him, whether scoring or not, to
  make 100. The number, of course, varies with the luck of the balls and the
  mood of the player; but, taken over a dozen or twenty games, it gives a fair
  average idea of the player's form, and a man by himself can in this way test
  his own powers. If, for example, a player could, on an average, score 100 in
  twenty innings then his average would be five, which is very fair amateur
  form. If a man finds his "decimal" rise as high as ten over a sequence of
  games, he may be sure that he can hold his own against most players that he
  is likely to meet. I daresay my own decimal when I was in practice would be
  from six to eight.</p>

  <p>I was never good enough for the big matches, and though I once went in for
  the Amateur championship it was not out of any illusions about my game, but
  because I was specially asked to do so, as it was advisable to strengthen the
  undoubted amateur element in the contest. By the luck of a bye, and by
  beating a player who was about my own form, I got into the third round, when
  I ran across Mr. Evans, who eventually reached the final with my scalp as
  well as several others at his girdle. I made 650 against his 1,000, which, as
  I was not helped by a bad fall from a motor bike a few days before, was as
  much as I could expect. Forty-two off the red was my best effort. Surely
  billiards is the king of all indoor games, and should have some writer who
  would do for it in prose what John Nyren did for cricket. I have never seen
  any worthy appreciation of its infinite varieties from the forcing losing
  hazard which goes roaring into a top pocket with a clash upon the rail, to
  the feather stroke so delicate that it is only the quiver of reflected light
  upon the object ball which shows that it has indeed been struck. Greatest of
  all is the ball heavily loaded with side which drifts down the long cushion
  and then is sucked against every apparent law into the pocket as though it
  were the centre of a whirlpool. Mr. E. V. Lucas is one who could do it with
  discernment.</p>

  <p>I have one funny recollection of billiards, when I wandered into some
  small hotel in a South-Coast watering place, and for want of something to do
  played the marker. He was a pompous person in a frock coat with a very good
  opinion of his own game, which was really ruined by a habit he had of
  jerking. I won the match, which was not difficult to do, and then I thought
  it a kindness to point out to the man how he could improve his game. He took
  this badly, however, and hinted that he allowed gentlemen who played him to
  get the better of him. This in turn annoyed me, so I said: "Look here. I will
  come in after dinner and you can show all you can do, and you shall have a
  sovereign if you win." After dinner his game was worse than ever, while I had
  amazing luck and made the 100 in about three shots. As I put on my coat and
  was leaving the room the queer little fellow sidled up to me and said: "I beg
  pardon, sir, but is your name Roberts?"</p>

  <p>My earliest recollection of cricket is not a particularly pleasant one.
  When I was a very small boy at a preparatory school I was one of a group of
  admirers who stood around watching a young cricketer who had just made his
  name hitting big hits off the school bowlers. One of the big hits landed on
  my knee-cap and the cricketer in his own famous arms carried me off to the
  school infirmary. The name, Tom Emmett, lingers in my memory, though it was
  some years before I appreciated exactly what he stood for in the game. I
  think, like most boys, I would rather have been knocked down by a first-class
  cricketer than picked up by a second-rater.</p>

  <p>That was the beginning of my acquaintance with a game which has on the
  whole given me more pleasure during my life than any other branch of sport. I
  have ended by being its victim, for a fast bowler some years ago happened to
  hit me twice in the same place under my left knee, which has left a permanent
  weak-ness. I have had as long an innings as one could reasonably expect, and
  carry many pleasant friendships and recollections away with me.</p>

  <p>I was a keen cricketer as a boy, but in my student days was too occupied
  to touch it. Then I took it up again, but my progress was interrupted by work
  and travel. I had some cause, therefore, to hold on to the game as I had lost
  so much of it in my youth. Finally, I fulfilled a secret ambition by getting
  into the fringe of first-class cricket, though rather, perhaps, through the
  good nature of others than my own merits. How-ever, I can truly say that in
  the last season when I played some first-class cricket, including matches
  against Kent, Derbyshire, and the London County, I had an average of
  thirty-two for those games, so I may claim to have earned my place. I was
  more useful, however, in an amateur team, for I was a fairly steady and
  reliable bowler, and I could generally earn my place in that department,
  while with the M.C.C. the professional talent is usually so strong that the
  amateur who fails in batting and is not a particularly good field has no
  chance of atoning with the ball. Yet even with the M.C.C. I have occasionally
  had a gleam of success. Such a one came some years ago, when the team
  presented me with a little silver hat for getting three consecutive
  clean-bowled wickets against the Gentlemen of Warwick. One of my victims
  explained his downfall by assuring me that he had it thoroughly in his head
  that I was a left-handed bowler, and when the ball came from my right hand he
  was too bewildered to stop it. The reason is not so good as that of an artist
  who, when I had bowled him out, exclaimed: "Who can play against a man who
  bowls in a crude pink shirt against an olive-green background?"</p>

  <p>A bowler has many days when everything is against him, when a hard, smooth
  wicket takes all the spin and devil out of him, when he goes all round and
  over the wicket, when lofted balls refuse to come to hand, or, if they do
  come, refuse to stay. But, on the other hand, he has his recompense with many
  a stroke of good fortune. It was in such a moment that I had the good luck to
  get the wicket of W. G. Grace, the greatest of all cricketers.</p>

  <p>W. G. had his speedy revenge. There was nothing more childlike and bland
  than that slow, tossed-up bowling of his, and nothing more subtle and
  treacherous. He was always on the wicket or about it, never sent down a
  really loose ball, worked continually a few inches from the leg, and had a
  perfect command of length. It was the latter quality which was my downfall. I
  had made some thirty or forty, and began to relax in the deep respect with
  which I faced the Doctor's deliveries. I had driven him for four, and jumped
  out at him again the next ball. Seeing my intention, as a good bowler does,
  he dropped his ball a foot or two shorter. I reached it with difficulty, but
  again I scored four. By this time I was very pleased with myself, and could
  see no reason why every one of these delightful slows should not mean a four
  to me. Out I danced to reach the next one on the half volley. It was tossed a
  little higher up in the air, which gave the delusion that it was coming right
  up to the bat, but as a matter of fact it pitched well short of my reach,
  broke sharply across and Lilley, the wicket-keeper, had my bails off in a
  twinkling. One feels rather cheap when one walks from the middle of the pitch
  to the pavilion, longing to kick oneself for one's own foolishness all the
  way. I have only once felt smaller, and that was when I was bowled by A. P.
  Lucas, by the most singular ball that I have ever received. He propelled it
  like a quoit into the air to a height of at least 30 feet, and it fell
  straight and true on to the top of the bails. I have often wondered what a
  good batsman would have made of that ball. To play it one would have needed
  to turn the blade of the bat straight up, and could hardly fail to give a
  chance. I tried to cut it off my stumps, with the result that I knocked down
  my wicket and broke my bat, while the ball fell in the midst of this general
  chaos. I spent the rest of the day wondering gloomily what I ought to have
  done&mdash;and I am wondering yet.</p>

  <p>I have had two unusual experiences upon Lord's ground. One was that I got
  a century in the very first match that I played there. It was an unimportant
  game, it is true, but still the surprising fact remained. It was a heavy day,
  and my bat, still encrusted with the classic mud, hangs as a treasured relic
  in my hall. The other was less pleasant and even more surprising. I was
  playing for the Club against Kent, and faced for the first time Bradley, who
  was that year one of the fastest bowlers in England. His first delivery I
  hardly saw, and it landed with a terrific thud upon my thigh. A little
  occasional pain is one of the chances of cricket, and one takes it as
  cheerfully as one can, but on this occasion it suddenly became sharp to an
  unbearable degree. I clapped my hand to the spot, and found to my amazement
  that I was on fire. The ball had landed straight on a small tin vesta box in
  my trousers pocket, had splintered the box, and set the matches ablaze. It
  did not take me long to turn out my pocket and scatter the burning vestas
  over the grass. I should have thought this incident unique, but Alec Hearne,
  to whom I told it, assured me that he had seen more than one accident of the
  kind. W. G. was greatly amused. "Couldn't get you out&mdash;had to set you on
  fire!" he cried, in the high voice which seemed so queer from so big a
  body.</p>

  <p>There are certain matches which stand out in one's memory for their
  peculiar surroundings. One was a match played against Cape de Verde at that
  island on the way to South Africa. There is an Atlantic telegraph station
  there with a large staff, and they turn out an excellent eleven. I understand
  that they played each transport as it passed, and that they had defeated all,
  including the Guards. We made up a very fair team, however, under the
  captaincy of Lord Henry Scott, and after a hard fight we defeated the
  islanders. I don't know how many of our eleven left their bones in South
  Africa; three at least&mdash;Blasson, Douglas Forbes (who made our top
  score), and young Maxwell Craig never returned. I remember one even more
  tragic match in which I played for the Incogniti against Aldershot Division a
  few months before the African War. The regiments quartered there were those
  which afterwards saw the hardest service. Major Ray, who made the top score,
  was killed at Magersfontein. Young Stanley, who went in first with me, met
  his death in the Yeomanry. Taking the two teams right through, I am sure that
  half the men were killed or wounded within two years. How little we could
  have foreseen it that sunny summer day!</p>

  <p>It is dangerous when an old cricketer begins to reminisce, because so much
  comes back to his mind. He has but to smell the hot rubber of a bat handle to
  be flooded with memories. They are not always glorious. I remember three
  ladies coming to see me play against one of the Bedford schools. The boys
  politely applauded as I approached the wicket. A very small boy lobbed up the
  first ball which I played at. It went up into the air, and was caught at
  point by the very smallest boy I have ever seen in decent cricket. It seemed
  to me about a mile as I walked back from the wicket to the pavilion. I don't
  think those three ladies ever recovered their confidence in my cricketing
  powers.</p>

  <p>As a set-off to this confession of failure let me add a small instance of
  success, where by "taking thought" I saved a minor international match. It
  was at the Hague in 1892, and the game was a wandering British team against
  Holland. The Dutch were an excellent sporting lot, and had one remarkable
  bowler in Posthuma, a left-hander, who had so huge a break with his slow ball
  that it was not uncommon for him to pitch the ball right outside the matting
  on which we played and yet bring it on to the wicket. We won our various
  local matches without much difficulty, but we were aware that we should have
  a stiff fight with United Holland, the more so as Dutch hospitality was
  almost as dangerous to our play as Dutch cricket.</p>

  <p>So it proved, and we were in the position that with four wickets in hand
  they had only fifteen runs to make with two batsmen well set. I had not
  bowled during the tour, for as we were a scratch team, mostly from the
  schoolmaster class, we did not know each other's capacity. Seeing, however,
  that things were getting desperate, I went the length of asking our skipper
  to give me a chance.</p>

  <p>I had observed that the batsmen had been very well taught by their English
  professional, and that they all played in most orthodox fashion with a
  perfectly straight bat. That was why I thought I might get them out. I
  brought every fielder round to the off, for I felt that they would not think
  it correct to pull, and I tossed up good length balls about a foot on the off
  side. It came off exactly as I expected. The pro. had not told them what to
  do with that particular sort of tosh, and the four men were all caught for as
  many runs by mid-off or cover. The team in their exultation proceeded to
  carry me into the pavilion, but whether it was my sixteen stone or the heat
  of the weather, they tired of the job midway and let me down with a crash
  which shook the breath out of me&mdash;so Holland was avenged. I played
  against them again when they came to England, and made sixty-seven, but got
  no wickets, for they had mastered the off-side theory.</p>

  <p>Some of my quaintest cricket reminiscences are in connection with J. M.
  Barrie's team&mdash;the "Allah-Akbarries," or "Lord help us" as we were
  called. We played in the old style, caring little about the game and a good
  deal about a jolly time and pleasant scenery. Broadway, the country home of
  Mr. Navarro and his wife, formerly Mary Anderson, the famous actress, was one
  of our favourite haunts, and for several years in succession we played the
  Artists there. Bernard Partridge, Barrie, A. E. W. Mason, Abbey the
  Academician, Blomfield the architect, Marriott Watson, Charles Whibley, and
  others of note took part, and there were many whimsical happenings, which
  were good fun if they were not good cricket. I thought all record of our
  games had faded from human ken, but lately a controversy was raised over Mr.
  Armstrong, the Australian captain, bowling the same man from opposite ends on
  consecutive overs. This led to the following paragraph in a Birmingham paper,
  which, I may say, entirely exaggerates my powers but is otherwise
  correct.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center">"BARRIE AND ARMSTRONG.</p>

  <p>"I am not surprised that in the matter of Mr. Armstrong's conduct in
  bowling two consecutive overs from different ends, no reference has been made
  to the important precedent which on a similar occasion Sir James Barrie
  failed to establish (writes a correspondent of the 'Nation'). The occasion
  was his captaincy (at Broadway, in Worcestershire) of an eleven of writers
  against a strong team of alleged artists. The circumstances were these. One
  side had compiled seventy-two runs, chiefly, if not wholly, contributed by
  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.</p>

  <p>"The sun-worshippers had thereupon responded with an equal number of runs
  for the loss of all but their last wicket. The ninth wicket had fallen to the
  last ball of Sir Arthur's over, the other eight having succumbed to the same
  performer, then in his prime. Actuated, apparently, by the belief that Sir
  Arthur was the only bowler of his side capable of taking or reaching a
  wicket, even in Worcestershire, Sir James thereupon put him on at the
  opposite end.</p>

  <p>"Before, however, he could take a practice ball, a shout was heard from
  the artists' pavilion, and the nine unengaged players were seen issuing from
  it to contest our captain's decision. After an exciting contest, it was
  ultimately given in their favour, with the result that the first ball of the
  new bowler was hit for two, assisted by overthrows, and the innings and match
  were won by the artists."<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Of Barrie's team I remember that it was printed at the bottom of our cards
  that the practice ground was in the "National Observer" Office. Mr. Abbey,
  the famous artist, usually captained against Barrie, and it was part of the
  agreement that each should have a full pitch to leg just to start his score.
  I remember my horror when by mistake I bowled a straight first ball to Abbey,
  and so broke the unwritten law as well as the wicket. Abbey knew nothing of
  the game, but Barrie was no novice. He bowled an insidious left-hand good
  length ball coming from leg which was always likely to get a wicket.</p>

  <p>Talking of bowling, I have twice performed the rare feat of getting all
  ten wickets. Once it was against a London Club, and once I ran through the
  side of a Dragoon Regiment at Norwich. My best performance at Lords was seven
  wickets for fifty-one against Cambridgeshire in 1904.</p>

  <p>Of fencing my experience has been limited, and yet I have seen enough to
  realize what a splendid toughening exercise it is. I nearly had an ugly
  mishap when practising it. I had visited a medical man in Southsea who was an
  expert with the foils, and at his invitation had a bout with him. I had put
  on the mask and glove, but was loath to have the trouble of fastening on the
  heavy chest plastron. He insisted, however, and his insistence saved me from
  an awkward wound, for, coming in heavily upon a thrust, his foil broke a few
  inches from the end, and the sharp point thus created went deeply into the
  pad which covered me. I learned a lesson that day.</p>

  <p>On the whole, considering the amount of varied sport which I have done, I
  have come off very well as regards bodily injury. One finger broken at
  football, two at cricket (one after the other in the same season), the
  disablement of my knee&mdash;that almost exhausts it. Though a heavy man and
  quite an indifferent rider, I have never hurt myself in a fair selection of
  falls in the hunting field and elsewhere. Once, as I have narrated, when I
  was down, the horse kicked me over the eye with his forefoot, but I got off
  with a rather ragged wound, though it might have been very much more
  serious.</p>

  <p>Indeed, when it comes to escapes, I have had more than my share of luck.
  One of the worst was in a motor accident, when the machine, which weighed
  over a ton, ran up a high bank, threw me out on a gravel drive below, and
  then, turning over, fell upon the top of me. The steering wheel projected
  slightly from the rest, and thus broke the impact and undoubtedly saved my
  life, but it gave way under the strain, and the weight of the car settled
  across my spine just below the neck, pinning my face down on the gravel, and
  pressing with such terrific force as to make it impossible to utter a sound.
  I felt the weight getting heavier moment by moment, and wondered how long my
  vertebrae could stand it. However, they did so long enough to enable a crowd
  to collect and the car to be levered off me. I should think there are few who
  can say that they have held up a ton weight across their spine and lived
  unparalyzed to talk about it. It is an acrobatic feat which I have no desire
  to repeat.</p>

  <p>There is plenty of sport in driving one's own motor and meeting the
  hundred and one unexpected roadside adventures and difficulties which are
  continually arising. These were greater a few years ago, when motors were
  themselves less solidly and accurately constructed, drivers were less
  skilled, and frightened horses were more in evidence. No invention of modern
  civilization has done so much for developing a man's power of resource and
  judgment as the motor. To meet and overcome a sudden emergency is the best of
  human training, and if a man is his own driver and mechanician on a fairly
  long journey he can hardly fail to have some experience of it.</p>

  <p>I well remember in the early days of motoring going up to Birmingham to
  take delivery of my new 12 horse-power Wolseley. I had invested in the sort
  of peaked yachting cap which was considered the correct badge of the motorist
  in those days, but as I paced the plat-form of New Street Station a woman
  removed any conceit I might have over my headgear, by asking me peremptorily
  how the trains ran to Walsall. She took me for one of the officials. I got
  the car safely home, and no doubt it was a good car as things went at that
  time, but the secret of safe brakes had not yet been discovered, and my pair
  used to break as if they were glass. More than once I have known what it is
  to steer a car when it is flying backwards under no control down a winding
  hill. Looking back at those days it seems to me that I was under the car
  nearly as much as on the top of it, for every repair had to be done from
  below. There were few accidents from smashing my differential, seizing my
  engines, and stripping my gears, which I have not endured. It was a
  chain-driven machine, and I can well remember one absurd incident when the
  chain jumped the cogs and fell off. We were on a long slope of 3 miles and
  ran on with the engine turned off quite unconscious of what had occurred.
  When we reached level ground the car naturally stopped, and we got out,
  opened the bonnet, tested the electricity, and were utterly puzzled as to
  what was amiss, when a yokel in a cart arrived waving our motive power over
  his head. He had picked it up on the road.</p>

  <p>Our descendants will never realize the terror of the horses at this
  innovation, nor the absurd scenes which it caused. On one occasion I was
  motoring down a narrow lane in Norfolk, with my mother in the open tonneau.
  Coming round a curve we came upon two carts, one behind the other. The
  leading horse, which had apparently never seen a motor before, propped his
  forelegs out, his ears shot forward, his eyes stared rigidly and then in a
  moment he whirled round, ran up the bank, and tried to escape behind his
  comrade. This he could have done but for the cart, which he also dragged up
  the bank. Horse and cart fell sideways on the other horse and cart, and there
  was such a mixture that you could not disentangle it. The carts were full of
  turnips and these formed a top dressing over the interlaced shafts and the
  struggling horses. I sprang out and was trying to help the enraged farmer to
  get something right end up, when I glanced at my own car which was almost
  involved in the pile. There was my dear old mother sitting calmly knitting in
  the midst of all the chaos. It was really like something in a dream.</p>

  <p>My most remarkable motor car experience was when I drove my own 16
  horse-power Dietrich-Lorraine in the International Road Competition organized
  by Prince Henry of Prussia in 1911. This affair is discussed later, when I
  come to the preludes of war. I came away from it with sinister forebodings.
  The impression left on my mind by the whole incident is shown by the fact
  that one of the first things I did when I got to London was to recommend a
  firm of which I am director to remove a large sum which it had lying in
  Berlin. I have no doubt that it would have continued to lie there and that we
  might have lost it. As to the contest itself it ended in a British victory,
  which was owing to the staunch way in which we helped each other when in
  difficulties, while the Germans were more a crowd of individuals than a team.
  Their cars were excellent and so was their driving. My own little car did
  very well and only dropped marks at Sutton Bank in Yorkshire, that terrible
  hill, one in three at one point, with a hair-pin bend. When we finally panted
  out our strength I put my light-weight chauffeur to the wheel, ran round, and
  fairly boosted her up from behind, but we were fined so many marks for my
  leaving the driving wheel. Not to get up would have meant three times the
  forfeit, so my tactics were well justified.</p>

  <p>No doubt the coming science of aviation will develop the same qualities as
  motor driving to an even higher degree. It Is a form of sport in which I have
  only aspirations and little experience. I had one balloon ascent in which we
  covered some 25 miles and ascended 6,000 feet, which was so delightful an
  expedition that I have always been eager for another and a longer one. A man
  has a natural trepidation the first time he leaves the ground, but I remember
  that, as I stood by the basket with the gas-bag swinging about above me and
  the assistants clinging to the ropes, some one pointed out an elderly
  gentleman and said: "That is the famous Mr. So-and-So, the aeronaut." I saw a
  venerable person and I asked how many ascents he had made.</p>

  <p>"About a thousand," was the answer. No eloquence or reasoning could have
  convinced me so completely that I might get into the basket with a cheerful
  mind, though I will admit that for the first minute or so one feels very
  strange, and keeps an uncommonly tight grip of the side-ropes. This soon
  passes, however, and one is lost in the wonder of the prospect and the
  glorious feeling of freedom and detachment. As in a ship, it is the moment of
  nearing land once more which is the moment of danger&mdash;or, at least, of
  discomfort; but beyond a bump or two, we came to rest very quietly in the
  heart of a Kentish hop-field.</p>

  <p>I had one aeroplane excursion in rather early days, but the experience was
  not entirely a pleasant one. Machines were under-engined in those days and
  very much at the mercy of the wind. We went up at Hendon&mdash;May 25, 1911,
  the date&mdash;but the machine was a heavy bi-plane, and though it went down
  wind like a swallow it was more serious when we turned and found, looking
  down, that the objects below us were stationary or even inclined to drift
  backwards. However, we got back to the field at last, and I think the pilot
  was as relieved as I. What impressed me most was the terrible racket of the
  propeller, comparing so unfavourably with the delicious calm of the balloon
  journey.</p>

  <p>There is one form of sport in which I have, I think, been able to do some
  practical good, for I can claim to have been the first to introduce skis into
  the Grisons division of Switzerland, or at least to demonstrate their
  practical utility as a means of getting across in winter from one valley to
  another. It was in 1894 that I read Nansen's account of his crossing of
  Greenland, and thus became interested in the subject of ski-ing. It chanced
  that I was compelled to spend that winter in the Davos valley, and I spoke
  about the matter to Tobias Branger, a sporting tradesman in the village, who
  in turn interested his brother. We sent for skis from Norway, and for some
  weeks afforded innocent amusement to a large number of people who watched our
  awkward movements and complex tumbles. The Brangers made much better progress
  than I. At the end of a month or so we felt that we were getting more expert,
  and determined to climb the Jacobshorn, a considerable hill just opposite the
  Davos Hotel. We had to carry our unwieldy skis upon our backs until we had
  passed the fir trees which line its slopes, but once in the open we made
  splendid progress, and had the satisfaction of seeing the flags in the
  village dipped in our honour when we reached the summit. But it was only in
  returning that we got the full flavour of ski-ing. In ascending you shuffle
  up by long zigzags, the only advantage of your footgear being that it is
  carrying you over snow which would engulf you without it. But coming back you
  simply turn your long toes and let yourself go, gliding delightfully over the
  gentle slopes, flying down the steeper ones, taking an occasional cropper,
  but getting as near to flying as any earth-bound man can. In that glorious
  air it is a delightful experience.</p>

  <p>Encouraged by our success with the Jacobshorn, we determined to show the
  utility of our accomplishment by opening up communications with Arosa, which
  lies in a parallel valley and can only be reached in winter by a very long
  and roundabout railway journey. To do this we had to cross a high pass, and
  then drop down on the other side. It was a most interesting journey, and we
  felt all the pride of pioneers as we arrived in Arosa.</p>

  <p>I have no doubt that what we did would seem absurdly simple to Norwegians
  or others who were apt at the game, but we had to find things out for
  ourselves and it was sometimes rather terrifying. The sun had not yet
  softened the snow on one sharp slope across which we had to go, and we had to
  stamp with our skis in order to get any foothold. On our left the snow slope
  ended in a chasm from which a blue smoke or fog rose in the morning air. I
  hardly dared look in that direction, but from the corner of my eye I saw the
  vapour of the abyss. I stamped along and the two gallant Switzers got on my
  left, so that if I slipped the shock would come upon them. We had no rope by
  which we could link up. We got across all right and perhaps we exaggerated
  the danger, but it was not a pleasant experience.</p>

  <p>Then I remember that we came to an absolute precipice, up which no doubt
  the path zig-zags in summer. It was not of course perpendicular, but it
  seemed little removed from it, and it had just slope enough to hold the snow.
  It looked impassable, but the Brangers had picked up a lot in some way of
  their own. They took off their skis, fastened them together with a thong, and
  on this toboggan they sat, pushing themselves over the edge, and going down
  amid a tremendous spray of flying snow. When they had reached safety they
  beckoned to me to follow. I had done as they did, and was sitting on my ski
  preparatory to launching myself when a fearsome thing happened, for my ski
  shot from under me, flew down the slope, and vanished in huge bounds among
  the snow mounds beyond. It was a nasty moment, and the poor Brangers stood
  looking up at me some hundreds of feet below me in a dismal state of mind.
  However, there was no possible choice as to what to do, so I did it. I let
  myself go over the edge, and came squattering down, with legs and arms
  extended to check the momentum. A minute later I was rolling covered with
  snow at the feet of my guides, and my skis were found some hundreds of yards
  away, so no harm was done after all.</p>

  <p>I remember that when we signed the hotel register Tobias Branger filled up
  the space after my name, in which the new arrival had to describe his
  profession, by the word "Sportesmann," which I took as a compliment. It was
  at any rate more pleasant than the German description of my golf clubs, which
  went astray on the railway and turned up at last with the official
  description of "Kinderspieler" (child's toys) attached to them. To return to
  the skis they are no doubt in very general use, but I think I am right in
  saying that these and other excursions of ours first demonstrated their
  possibilities to the people of the country and have certainly sent a good
  many thousands of pounds since then into Switzerland. If my rather rambling
  career in sport has been of any practical value to any one, it is probably in
  this matter, and also, perhaps, in the opening up of miniature rifle-ranges
  in 1901, when the idea was young in this country, and when my Hindhead range
  was the pioneer and the model for many others.</p>

  <p>A pleasing souvenir of my work on Rifle Clubs is to be found in the Conan
  Doyle Cup, which was presented by my friend Sir John Langman, and is still
  shot for every year at Bisley by civilian teams.</p>

  <p>On the whole as I look back there is no regret in my mind for the time
  that I have devoted to sport. It gives health and strength, but above all it
  gives a certain balance of mind without which a man is not complete. To give
  and to take, to accept success modestly and defeat bravely, to fight against
  odds, to stick to one's point, to give credit to your enemy and value your
  friend&mdash;these are some of the lessons which true sport should
  impart.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-25"
     id="ch-25"></a>XXV &mdash; TO THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS IN 1914</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">Baseball&mdash;Parkman&mdash;Ticonderoga&mdash;Prairie
  Towns&mdash;Procession of Ceres&mdash;Relics of the Past&mdash;A
  Moose&mdash;Prospects for Emigrants&mdash;Jasper Park&mdash;The Great
  Divide&mdash;Algonquin Park.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IN 1914, with little perception of how near we were to the
  greatest event of the world's history, we accepted an invitation from the
  Canadian Government to inspect the National Reserve at Jasper Park in the
  Northern Rockies. The Grand Trunk Railway (Canadian) made matters easy for us
  by generously undertaking to pass us over their system and to place a private
  car at our disposal. This proved to be a gloriously comfortable and compact
  little home consisting of a parlour, a dining-room and a bedroom. It belonged
  to Mr. Chamberlin, the president of the line, who allowed us the use of it.
  Full of anticipation we started off in May upon our long and pleasant
  journey. Our first point was New York, where we hoped to put in a week of
  sight-seeing, since my wife had never been to America. Then we were to go
  North and meet our kind hosts of Canada. At the Plaza Hotel of New York we
  found ourselves in pleasant quarters for a hectic week. Here are a few
  impressions.</p>

  <p>We went to see a baseball game at New York&mdash;a first-class match, as
  we should say&mdash;or "some ball," as a native expert described it. I looked
  on it all with the critical but sympathetic eyes of an experienced though
  decrepit cricketer. The men were fine fellows, harder looking than most of
  our professionals&mdash;indeed they train continually, and some of the teams
  had even before the days of prohibition to practise complete abstinence,
  which is said to show its good results not so much in physical fitness as in
  the mental quickness which is very essential in the game. The catching seemed
  to me extraordinarily good, especially the judging of the long catches by the
  "bleachers," as the outfields who are far from any shade are called. The
  throwing in is also remarkably hard and accurate, and, if applied to cricket,
  would astonish some of our batsmen. The men earn anything from £1,000 to
  £1,500 in the season. This money question is a weak point of the game, as it
  is among our own Soccer clubs, since it means that the largest purse has the
  best team, and there is no necessary relation between the player and the
  place he plays for. Thus we looked upon New York defeating the Philadelphia
  Athletics, but there was no more reason to suppose that New York had actually
  produced one team than that Philadelphia had produced the other. For this
  reason the smaller matches, such as are played between local teams or
  colleges, seem to me to be more exciting, as they do represent something
  definite.</p>

  <p>The pitcher is the man who commands the highest salary and has mastered
  the hardest part of the game. His pace is remarkable, far faster, I should
  say, than any bowling; but of course it is a throw, and as such would not be
  possible in the cricket field. I had one uneasy moment when I was asked in
  Canada to take the bat and open a baseball game. The pitcher, fortunately was
  merciful, and the ball came swift but true. I steadied myself by trying to
  imagine that it was a bat which I held in my grasp and that this was a full
  toss, which asked to be hit over the ropes. Fortunately, I got it fairly in
  the middle and it went on its appointed way, whizzing past the ear of a
  photographer, who expected me to pat it. I should not care to have to
  duplicate the performance&mdash;nor would the photographer.</p>

  <p>I took the opportunity when I was in New York to inspect the two famous
  prisons, The Tombs and Sing Sing. The Tombs is in the very heart of the city,
  and a gloomy, ill-boding place it is when seen from without. Within it is
  equally dismal. I walked round in a somewhat shamefaced way, for it makes you
  feel so when you encounter human suffering which you cannot relieve. Warders
  and prisoners seemed however to be cheerful enough, and there was an off-hand
  way of doing things which seemed strange after our rigid methods. A Chinese
  prisoner, for example, was standing at the bottom of the lift, and I heard
  the warder shout through the tube, "Have you got room for another Chink in
  number three?" I had a talk with one strange Englishman who was barred in
  like a wild beast. He spoke of the various prisons, of which he had a wide
  acquaintance, exactly as if they were hotels which he was recommending or
  condemning. "Toronto is a very poor show. The food is bad. I hope I may never
  see Toronto Gaol again. Detroit is better. I had quite a pleasant time in
  Detroit." And so on. He spoke and looked like a gentleman, but I could quite
  imagine, in spite of his genial manner, that he was a dangerous crook. When I
  left him he said: "Well, bye-bye! Sorry you have to go! We can't all be out
  and about, can we?"</p>

  <p>In the same week I went to Sing Sing, the State Penitentiary, which is
  some twenty miles from the city on the banks of the Hudson. It is an ancient
  building, dating from the middle of last century, and it certainly should be
  condemned by a rich and prosperous community. By a strange coincidence the
  convicts were having one of their few treats in the year that day, and I was
  able to see them all assembled together in the great hall, listening to a
  music-hall troupe from New York. Poor devils, all the forced, vulgar gaiety
  of the songs and the antics of half-clad women must have provoked a terrible
  reaction in their minds. Many of them had, I observed, abnormalities of
  cranium or of features which made it clear that they were not wholly
  responsible for their actions. There was a good sprinkling of coloured men
  among them. Here and there I noticed an intelligent and even a good face. One
  wondered how they got there.</p>

  <p>I was locked up afterwards in one of the cells&mdash;seven feet by
  four&mdash;and I was also placed in the electrocution chair, a very ordinary,
  stout, cane-bottomed seat, with a good many sinister wires dangling round it.
  I had a long talk with the Governor, who seemed in himself to be a humane
  man, but terribly hampered by the awful building which he had to
  administer.</p>

  <p>One morning of early June "my Lady Sunshine" and I&mdash;(if I may be
  allowed to quote the charmingly appropriate name which the New York Press had
  given to my wife) left New York for Parkman Land, which I had long wished to
  explore. We were glad to get away as we had been considerably harassed by the
  ubiquitous and energetic American reporter.</p>

  <p>This individual is really, in nine cases out of ten, a very good fellow,
  and if you will treat him with decent civility he will make the best of you
  with the public. It is absurd for travellers to be rude to him, as is too
  often the attitude of the wandering Briton. The man is under orders from his
  paper, and if he returns without results it is not a compliment upon his
  delicacy which will await him. He is out to see you and describe you, and if
  he finds you an ill-tempered, cantankerous curmudgeon, he very naturally says
  so and turns out some excellent spicy reading at your expense. The indignant
  Briton imagines that this is done in revenge. The reporter would not be human
  if it did not amuse him to do it, but it very often represents the exact
  impression which the vituperative traveller has made upon the pressman,
  himself as often as not an overworked and highly-strung man.</p>

  <p>Reminiscences of interviews are occasionally amusing. I can remember that
  on my previous visit I was approached one night by an interviewer in a very
  marked state of intoxication. He was so drunk that I wondered what in the
  world he would make of his subject, and I bought his paper next day to see.
  To my amusement I found that I had made the worst possible impression upon
  him. He had found no good in me at all. He may even have attributed to me his
  own weakness, like the Scotch toper who said: "Sandy drank that hard that by
  the end of the evening I couldn't see him."</p>

  <p>To return to Parkman Land. I am surprised to find how few Americans and
  fewer Canadians there are who appreciate that great historian at his true
  worth. I wonder whether any man of letters has ever devoted himself to a task
  with such whole-hearted devotion as Parkman. He knew the old bloody frontier
  as Scott knew the border marches. He was soaked in New England tradition. He
  prepared himself for writing about Indians by living for months in their
  wigwams.</p>

  <p>He was intimate with old French life, and he spent some time in a
  religious house that he might catch something of the spirit which played so
  great a part in the early history of Canada. On the top of all this he had
  the well-balanced, unprejudiced mind of the great chronicler, and he
  cultivated a style which was equally removed from insipidity and from
  affectation. As to his industry and resolution, they are shown by the fact
  that he completed his volumes after he had been stricken by blindness. It is
  hard to name any historian who has such an equipment as this. From his
  "Pioneers of the New World" to his "Conspiracy of Pontiac" I have read his
  twelve volumes twice over, and put some small reflection of them into my
  "Refugees."</p>

  <p>We explored not only the beautiful tragic Lake George, but also its great
  neighbour Lake Champlain, almost as full of historical reminiscence. Upon
  this, level with the head of the smaller lake, stood Ticonderoga, the chief
  seat of the French Canadian power. Some five miles separate it from Lake
  George, up which the British came buzzing whenever they were strong enough to
  do so. Once in front of the palisades of Ticonderoga, they met with heavy
  defeat, and yet once again, by the valour of the newly-enrolled Black Watch,
  they swept the place off the map. I wonder if Stevenson had actually been
  there before he wrote his eerie haunting ballad&mdash;the second finest of
  the sort, in my opinion, in our literature. It is more than likely, since he
  spent some time in the neighbouring Adirondacks. Pious hands were restoring
  the old fort of Ticonderoga, much of which has been uncovered. All day we
  skirted Lake Champlain, into which the old French explorer first found his
  way, and where he made the dreadful mistake of mixing in Indian warfare,
  which brought the whole blood-thirsty vendetta of the five nations upon the
  young French settlements. Up at the head of the lake we saw Plattsburg, where
  the Americans gained a victory in the war of 1812. The sight of these
  battlefields, whether they mark British or American successes, always fills
  me with horror. If the war of 1776 was, as I hold, a glorious mistake, that
  of 1812 was a senseless blunder. Had neither occurred, the whole of North
  America would now be one magnificent undivided country, pursuing its own
  independent destiny, and yet united in such unblemished ties of blood and
  memory to the old country that each could lean at all times upon the other.
  It is best for Britishers, no doubt, that we should never lean upon anything
  bigger than ourselves. But I see no glory in these struggles, and little
  wisdom in the statesmen who waged them. Among them they split the race from
  base to summit, and who has been the gainer? Not Britain, who was alienated
  from so many of her very best children. Not America, who lost Canada and had
  on her hands a civil war which a United Empire could have avoided. Ah well,
  there is a controlling force somewhere, and the highest wisdom is to believe
  that all things are ordered for the best.</p>

  <p>About evening we crossed the Canadian frontier, the Richelieu River, down
  which the old Iroquois scalping parties used to creep, gleaming coldly in the
  twilight. There is nothing to show where you have crossed that border. There
  is the same sort of country, the same cultivation, the same plain wooden
  houses. Nothing was changed save that suddenly I saw a little old ensign
  flying on a gable, and it gives you a thrill when you have not seen it for a
  time.</p>

  <p>It is not until one has reached the Prairie country that the traveller
  meets with new conditions and new problems. He traverses Ontario with its
  prosperous mixed farms and its fruit-growing villages, but the general effect
  is the same as in Eastern America. Then comes the enormous stretch of the
  Great Lakes, those wonderful inland seas, with great oceangoing steamers. We
  saw the newly built <i>Noronic</i>, destined altogether for passenger
  traffic, and worthy to compare, both in internal fittings and outward
  appearance, with many an Atlantic liner. The Indians looked in amazement at
  La Salle's little vessel. I wondered what La Salle and his men would think of
  the <i>Noronic</i>! For two days in great comfort we voyaged over the inland
  waters. They lay peaceful for our passage, but we heard grim stories of
  winter gusts and of ships which were never heard of more. It is not
  surprising that there should be accidents, for the number of vessels is
  extraordinary, and being constructed with the one idea of carrying the
  maximum of cargo, they appeared to be not very stable. I am speaking now of
  the whaleback freight carriers and not of the fine passenger service, which
  could not be beaten.</p>

  <p>I have said that the number of vessels is extraordinary. I have been told
  that the tonnage passing through Saulte Ste. Marie, where the lakes join, is
  greater than that of any port in the world. All the supplies and manufactures
  for the West move one way, while the corn of the great prairie, and the ores
  from the Lake Superior copper and iron mines move the other. In the Fall
  there comes the triumphant procession of the harvest. Surely in more poetic
  days banners might have waved and cymbals clashed, and priests of Ceres sung
  their hymns in the vanguard, as this flotilla of mercy moved majestically
  over the face of the waters to the aid of hungry Europe. However, we have cut
  out the frills, to use the vernacular, though life would be none the worse
  could we tinge it a little with the iridescence of romance.</p>

  <p>We stopped at Sault Ste. Marie, the neck of the hourglass between the two
  great lakes of Huron and Superior. There were several things there which are
  worthy of record. The lakes are of a different level, and the lock which
  avoids the dangerous rapids is on an enormous scale; but, beside it,
  unnoticed save by those who know where to look and what to look for, there is
  a little stonelined cutting no larger than an uncovered drain&mdash;it is the
  detour by which for centuries the voyageurs, trappers, and explorers moved
  their canoes round the Sault or fall on their journey to the great solitudes
  beyond. Close by it is one of the old Hudson Bay log forts, with its
  fireproof roof, its loopholed walls, and every other device for Indian
  fighting. Very small and mean these things look by the side of the great
  locks and the huge steamers within them. But where would locks and steamers
  have been had these others not taken their lives in their hands to clear the
  way?</p>

  <p>The twin cities of Fort William and Port Arthur, at the head of Lake
  Superior, form the most growing community of Canada. They call them twin
  cities, but I expect, like their Siamese predecessors, they will grow into
  one. Already the suburbs join each other, though proximity does not always
  lead to amalgamation or even to cordiality, as in the adjacent towns of St.
  Paul and Minneapolis. When the little American boy was asked in Sunday school
  who persecuted Saint Paul, he "guessed it was Minneapolis." But in the case
  of Fort William and Port Arthur they are so evidently interdependent that it
  is difficult to believe that they will fail to coalesce; when they do, I am
  of opinion that they may grow to be a Canadian Chicago, and possibly become
  the greatest city in the country. All lines converge there, as does all the
  lake traffic, and everything from East to West must pass through it. If I
  were a rich man and wished to become richer, I should assuredly buy land in
  the twin cities. Though they lie in the very centre of the broadest portion
  of the continent, the water communications are so wonderful that an
  oceangoing steamer from Liverpool or Glasgow can now unload at their
  quays.</p>

  <p>The grain elevators of Fort William are really majestic erections, and
  with a little change of their construction might be aesthetic as well. Even
  now the huge cylinders into which they are divided look at a little distance
  not unlike the columns of Luxor. This branch of human ingenuity has been
  pushed at Fort William to its extreme. The last word has been said there upon
  every question covering the handling of grain. By some process, which is far
  beyond my unmechanical brain, the stuff is even divided automatically
  according to its quality, and there are special hospital elevators where
  damaged grain can be worked up into a more perfect article.</p>

  <p>By the way, it was here, while lying at a steamship wharf on the very edge
  of the city, that I first made the acquaintance of one of the original
  inhabitants of Canada. A cleared plain stretched from the ship to a wood some
  hundreds of yards off. As I stood upon deck I saw what I imagined to be a
  horse wander out of the wood and begin to graze in the clearing. The creature
  seemed ewenecked beyond all possibility, and looking closer I saw to my
  surprise that it was a wild hornless moose. Could anything be more
  characteristic of the present condition of Canada&mdash;the great mechanical
  developments of Fort William within gunshot of me on one side, and this shy
  wanderer of the wilderness on the other? In a few years the dweller in the
  great city will read of my experience with the same mixture of incredulity
  and surprise with which we read the occasional correspondent's whose
  grandfather shot a woodcock in Maida Vale.</p>

  <p>The true division between the East and West of Canada is not the Great
  Lakes, which are so valuable as a waterway, but lies in the 500 miles of
  country between the Lakes and Winnipeg. It is barren, but beautiful, covered
  with forest which is not large enough to be of value as lumber. It is a
  country of rolling plains covered with low trees with rivers in the valleys.
  The soil is poor. It is really a problem what to do with this belt, which is
  small according to Canadian distance, but is none the less broader than the
  distance between London and Edinburgh. Unless minerals are found in it, I
  should think that it will be to Canada what the Highlands of Scotland are to
  Britain&mdash;a region set apart for sport because it has no other economic
  use. The singular thing about this barren treeland is that it quite suddenly
  changes to the fertile prairie at a point to the east of Winnipeg. I presume
  that there is some geological reason, but it was strange to see the fertile
  plain run up to the barren woods with as clear a division as there is between
  the sea and the shore.</p>

  <p>And now one reached the west of Winnipeg and on that prairie which means
  so much both to Canada and to the world. It was wonderfully impressive to
  travel swiftly all day from the early summer dawn to the latest evening
  light, and to see always the same little clusters of houses, always the same
  distant farms, always the same huge expanse stretching to the distant
  skyline, mottled with cattle, or green with the half-grown crops. You think
  these people are lonely. What about the people beyond them and beyond them
  again, each family in its rude barracks in the midst of the 160 acres which
  form the minimum farm? No doubt they are lonely, and yet there are
  alleviations. When men or women are working on their own property and seeing
  their fortune growing, they have pleasant thoughts to bear them company. It
  is the women, I am told, who feel it most, and who go prairie-mad. Now they
  have rigged telephone circles which connect up small groups of farms and
  enable the women to relieve their lives by a little friendly gossip, when the
  whole district thrills to the news that Mrs. Jones has been in the cars to
  Winnipeg and bought a new bonnet. At the worst the loneliness of the prairie
  can never, one would think, have the soul-killing effect of loneliness in a
  town. "There is always the wind on the heath, brother." Besides, the wireless
  has now arrived, and that is the best friend of the lonely man.</p>

  <p>Land is not so easily picked up by the emigrant as in the old days, when
  160 acres beside the railroad were given away free. There was still in 1914
  free land to be had, but it was in the back country. However, this back
  country of to-day is always liable to be opened up by the branch railway
  lines to-morrow. On the whole, however, it seems to be more economical, if
  the emigrant has the money, to buy a partially developed well-situated farm
  than to take up a virgin homestead. That is what the American emigrants do
  who have been pouring into the country, and they know best the value of such
  farms, having usually come from exactly similar ones just across the border,
  the only difference being that they can get ten acres in Canada for the price
  of one in Minnesota or Iowa. They hasten to take out their papers of
  naturalization, and make, it is said, most excellent and contented citizens.
  Their energy and industry are remarkable. A body of them had reached the land
  which they proposed to buy about the time that we were in the West; they had
  come over the border with their wagons, their horses, and their ploughs.
  Being taken to the spot by the land agent, the leader of the party tested the
  soil, cast a rapid glance over the general prairie, and then cried: "I guess
  this will do, boys. Get off the ploughs."</p>

  <p>The agent who was present told me that they had broken an acre of the
  prairie before they slept that night. These men were German Lutherans from
  Minnesota, and they settled in the neighbourhood of Scott. The gains on the
  farms are very considerable. It is not unusual for a man to pay every expense
  which he has incurred, including the price of the land, within the first two
  years. After that, with decent luck, he should be a prosperous man, able to
  bring up a family in ease and comfort. If he be British, and desires to
  return to the Old Country, it should not be difficult for him to save enough
  in ten or twelve years to make himself, after selling his farm, more or less
  independent for life. That is, as it seems to me, an important consideration
  for many people who hesitate to break all the old ties and feel that they are
  leaving their motherland for ever.</p>

  <p>So much about farms and farming. I cannot see how one can write about this
  western part and avoid the subject which is written in green and gold from
  sky to sky. There is nothing else. Nowhere is there any sign of
  yesterday&mdash;not a cairn, not a monument. Life has passed here, but has
  left no footstep behind. But stay, the one thing which the old life still
  leaves is just this one thing&mdash;footsteps. Look at them in the little
  narrow black paths which converge to the water&mdash;little dark ruts which
  wind and twist. Those are the buffalo runs of old. Gone are the Cree and
  Blackfoot hunters who shot them down. Gone, too, the fur-traders who bought
  the skins. Chief Factor MacTavish, who entered into the great Company's
  service as a boy, spent his life in slow promotion from Fort This to Fort
  That, and made a decent Presbyterian woman of some Indian squaw, finally saw
  with horror in his old age that the world was crowding his wild beasts out of
  their pastures. Gone are the great herds upon which both Indian hunter and
  fur-trader were parasitical. Indian, trader and buffalo all have passed, and
  here on the great plains are these narrow runways as the last remaining sign
  of a vanished world.</p>

  <p>Edmonton is the capital of the western side of the prairie, even as
  Winnipeg of the eastern. I do not suppose the average Briton has the least
  conception of the amenities of Winnipeg. He would probably be surprised to
  hear that the Fort Garry Hotel there is nearly as modern and luxurious as any
  hotel in Northumberland Avenue. There were no such luxuries in 1914 in
  Edmonton. The town was in a strangely half-formed condition, rude and raw,
  but with a great atmosphere of energy, bustle, and future greatness. With its
  railway connections and waterways it is bound to be a large city. At the time
  of our visit the streets were full of out-of-works, great husky men, some of
  them of magnificent physique, who found themselves at a loss, on account of
  cessations in railroad construction. They told me that they would soon be
  reabsorbed, but meantime the situation was the rudest object-lesson in
  economics that I have ever witnessed. Here were these splendid men, ready and
  willing to work. Here was a new country calling in every direction for
  labour. How come the two things to be even temporarily disconnected? There
  could be but one word. It was want of capital. And why was the capital
  wanting? Why was the work of the railroads held up? Because the money market
  was tight in London&mdash;London which finds, according to the most recent
  figures, 73 per cent. of all the moneys with which Canada is developed. Such
  was the state of things. What will amend it? How can capital be made to flow
  into the best channels? By encouragement and security and the hope of good
  returns. I never heard of any system of socialism which did not seem to
  defeat the very object which it had at heart. And yet it was surely
  deplorable that the men should be there, and that the work should be there,
  and that none could command the link which would unite them.</p>

  <p>A line of low distant hills broke the interminable plain which has
  extended with hardly a rising for 1,500 miles. Above them was, here and
  there, a peak of snow. Shades of Mayne Reid, they were the Rockies&mdash;my
  old familiar Rockies! Have I been here before? What an absurd question, when
  I lived here for about ten years of my life in all the hours of dreamland.
  What deeds have I not done among Redskins and trappers and grizzlies within
  their wilds! And here they were at last glimmering bright in the rising
  morning sun. At least, I have seen my dream mountains. Most boys never
  do.</p>

  <p>Jasper Park is one of the great national playgrounds and health resorts
  which the Canadian Government with great wisdom has laid out for the benefit
  of the citizens. When Canada has filled up and carries a large population,
  she will bless the foresight of the administrators who took possession of
  broad tracts of the most picturesque land and put them for ever out of the
  power of the speculative dealer. The National Park at Banff has for twenty
  years been a Mecca for tourists. That at Algonquin gives a great
  pleasure-ground to those who cannot extend their travels beyond Eastern
  Canada. But this new Jasper Park is the latest and the wildest of all these
  reserves. Some years ago it was absolute wilderness, and much of it
  impenetrable. Now, through the energy of Colonel Rogers, trails have been cut
  through it in various directions, and a great number of adventurous trips
  into country which is practically unknown can be carried out with ease and
  comfort. The packer plays the part of a dragoman in the East, arranging the
  whole expedition, food, cooking, and everything else on inclusive terms; and
  once in the hands of a first-class Rocky Mountain packer, a man of the
  standing of Fred Stephens or the Otto Brothers, the traveller can rely upon a
  square deal and the companionship of one whom he will find to be a most
  excellent comrade. There is no shooting in the park&mdash;it is a preserve
  for all wild animals&mdash;but there is excellent fishing, and everywhere
  there are the most wonderful excursions, where you sleep at night under the
  stars upon the balsamic fir branches which the packer gathers for your couch.
  I could not imagine an experience which would be more likely to give a
  freshet of vitality when the stream runs thin. For a week we lived the life
  of simplicity and nature.</p>

  <p>The park is not as full of wild creatures as it will be after a few years
  of preservation. The Indians who lived in this part rounded up everything
  that they could before moving to their reservation. But even now, the bear
  lumbers through the brushwood, the eagle soars above the lake, the timber
  wolf still skulks in the night, and the deer graze in the valleys. Above,
  near the snow-line, the wild goat is not uncommon, while at a lower altitude
  are found the mountain sheep. On the last day of our visit the rare cinnamon
  bear exposed his yellow coat upon a clearing within a few hundred yards of
  the village. I saw his clumsy good-humoured head looking at me from over a
  dead trunk, and I thanked the kindly Canadian law which has given him a place
  of sanctuary. What a bloodthirsty baboon man must appear to the lower
  animals! If any superhuman demon treated us exactly as we treat the
  pheasants, we should begin to reconsider our views as to what is sport.</p>

  <p>The porcupine is another creature which abounded in the woods. I did not
  see any, but a friend described an encounter between one and his dog. The
  creature's quills are detachable when he wishes to be nasty, and at the end
  of the fight it was not easy to say which was the dog and which the
  porcupine.</p>

  <p>Life in Jasper interested me as an experience of the first stage of a raw
  Canadian town. It will certainly grow into a considerable place, but at that
  time, bar Colonel Rogers' house and the station, there were only log-huts and
  small wooden dwellings. Christianity was apostolic in its simplicity and in
  its freedom from strife&mdash;though one has to go back remarkably early in
  apostolic times to find those characteristics. Two churches were being built,
  the pastor in each case acting also as head mason and carpenter. One, the
  corner-stone of which I had the honour of laying, was to be used in turn by
  several Nonconformist bodies, To the ceremony came the Anglican parson, grimy
  from his labours on the opposition building, and prayed for the well-being of
  his rival. The whole function, with its simplicity and earnestness, carried
  out by a group of ill-clad men standing bareheaded in a drizzle of rain,
  seemed to me to have in it the essence of religion. As I ventured to remark
  to them, Kikuyu and Jasper can give some lessons to London.</p>

  <p>We made a day's excursion by rail to the Tête Jaune Cache, which is across
  the British Columbian border and marks the watershed between East and West.
  Here we saw the Fraser, already a formidable river, rushing down to the
  Pacific. At the head of the pass stands the village of the railway workers,
  exactly like one of the mining townships of Bret Harte, save that the bad man
  is never allowed to be too bad. There is a worse man in a red serge coat and
  a Stetson hat, who is told off by the State to look after him, and does his
  duty in such fashion that the most fire-eating desperado from across the
  border falls into the line of law. But apart from the gunman, this village
  presented exactly the same queer cabins, strange signs, and gambling-rooms
  which the great American master has made so familiar to us.</p>

  <p>And now we were homeward bound! Back through Edmonton, back through
  Winnipeg, back through that young giant, Fort William&mdash;but not back
  across the Great Lakes. Instead of that transit we took train, by the
  courtesy of the Canadian Pacific, round the northern shore of Superior, a
  beautiful wooded desolate country, which, without minerals, offers little
  prospect for the future. Some 200 miles north of it, the Grand Trunk, that
  enterprising pioneer of empire, has opened up another line which extends for
  a thousand miles, and should develop a new corn and lumber district. Canada
  is like an expanding flower; wherever you look you see some fresh petal
  unrolling.</p>

  <p>We spent three days at Algonquin Park. This place is within easy distance
  of Montreal or Ottawa, and should become a resort of British fishermen and
  lovers of nature. After all, it is little more than a week from London, and
  many a river in Finland takes nearly as long to reach. There is good hotel
  accommodation, and out of the thousand odd lakes in this enormous natural
  preserve one can find all sorts of fishing, though the best is naturally the
  most remote. I had no particular luck myself, but my wife caught an
  eight-pound trout, which Mr. Bartlett, the courteous superintendent of the
  park, mounted, so as to confound all doubters. Deer abound in the park, and
  the black bear is not uncommon, while wolves can often be heard howling in
  the night-time.</p>

  <p>What will be the destiny of Canada? Some people talk as if it were in
  doubt. Personally, I have none upon the point. Canada will remain exactly as
  she is for two more generations. At the end of that time there must be
  reconsideration of the subject, especially on the part of Great Britain, who
  will find herself with a child as large as herself under the same roof.</p>

  <p>I see no argument for the union of Canada with the United States. There is
  excellent feeling between the two countries, but they could no more join at
  this period of their history than a great oak could combine with a
  well-rooted pine to make one tree. The roots of each are far too deep. It is
  impossible.</p>

  <p>Then there is the alternative of Canada becoming an independent nation.
  That is not so impossible as a union with the States, but it is in the last
  degree improbable. Why should Canada wish her independence? She has it now in
  every essential. But her first need is the capital and the population which
  will develop her enormous territory and resources. This capital she now
  receives from the Mother-Country to the extent in 1914 of 73 per cent., the
  United States finding 14 per cent., and Canada herself the remaining 13. Her
  dependence upon the Mother-Country for emigrants, though not so great as her
  financial dependence, is still the greatest from any single source. Besides
  all this, she has the vast insurance policy, which is called the British
  Navy, presented to her for nothing&mdash;though honour demands some premium
  from her in the future&mdash;and she has the British diplomatic service for
  her use unpaid. Altogether, looking at it from the material side, Canada's
  interests lie deeply in the present arrangement. But there is a higher and
  more unselfish view which works even more strongly in the same direction.
  Many of the most representative Canadians are descendants of those United
  Empire Loyalists who in 1782 gave up everything and emigrated from the United
  States in order to remain under the flag. Their imperialism is as warm or
  warmer than our own. And everywhere there is a consciousness of the glory of
  the empire, its magnificent future, and the wonderful possibilities of these
  great nations all growing up under the same flag with the same language and
  destinies. This sentiment joins with material advantages, and will prevent
  Canada from having any aspiration towards independence.</p>

  <p>Yes, it will remain exactly as it is for the remainder of this century. At
  the end of that time her population and resources will probably considerably
  exceed those of the Mother Land, and problems will arise which our children's
  children may have some difficulty in solving. As to the French-Canadian, he
  will always be a conservative force&mdash;let him call himself what he will.
  His occasional weakness for flying the French flag is not to be resented, but
  is rather a pathetic and sentimental tribute to a lost cause, like that which
  adorns every year the pedestal of Charles at Whitehall.</p>

  <p>I had some presentiment of coming trouble during the time we were in
  Canada, though I never imagined that we were so close to the edge of a
  world-war. One incident which struck me forcibly was the arrival at Vancouver
  of a ship full of Sikhs who demanded to be admitted to Canada. This demand
  was resisted on account of the immigration laws. The whole incident seemed to
  me to be so grotesque&mdash;for why should sun-loving Hindoos force
  themselves upon Canada&mdash;that I was convinced some larger purpose lay
  behind it. That purpose was, as we can now see, to promote discord among the
  races under the British flag. There can be no doubt that it was German money
  that chartered that ship.</p>

  <p>I had several opportunities of addressing large and influential Canadian
  audiences, and I never failed to insist upon the sound state of the home
  population. The Canadians judge us too often by our ne'er-do-weels and
  remittance men, who are the sample Englishmen who come before them. In
  defence even of these samples it should be stated that they bulked very large
  in the first Canadian Division. I told the Canadians of our magnificent Boy
  Scout movement, and also of the movement of old soldiers to form a national
  guard. "A country where both the old and the young can start new, unselfish,
  patriotic movements is a live country," I said, "and if we are tested we will
  prove just as good as ever our fathers were." I did not dream how near the
  test would be, how hard it would press, or how gloriously it would be
  met.</p>

  <p>And now I turn to the war, the physical climax of my life as it must be of
  the life of every living man and woman. Each was caught as a separate chip
  and swept into that fearsome whirlpool, where we all gyrated for four years,
  some sinking for ever, some washed up all twisted and bent, and all of us
  showing in our souls and bodies some mark of the terrible forces which had
  controlled us so long. I will show presently how the war reacted upon me, and
  also if one may speak without presumption, how in a minute way I in turn
  reacted upon the war.</p>

  <p class="first">FOR a long time I never seriously believed in the German
  menace. Frequently I found myself alone, in a company of educated Englishmen,
  in my opinion that it was non-existent&mdash;or at worst greatly exaggerated.
  This conclusion was formed on two grounds. The first was, that I knew it to
  be impossible that we could attack Germany save in the face of monstrous
  provocation. By the conditions of our government, even if those in high
  places desired to do such a thing, it was utterly impracticable, for a
  foreign war could not be successfully carried on by Great Britain unless the
  overwhelming majority of the people approved of it. Our foreign, like our
  home, politics are governed S by the vote of the proletariat. It would be
  impossible to wage an aggressive war against any Power if the public were not
  convinced of its justice and necessity. For this reason we could not attack
  Germany. On the other hand, it seemed to be equally unthinkable that Germany
  should attack us. One failed to see what she could possibly hope to gain by
  such a proceeding. She had enemies already upon her eastern and western
  frontiers, and it was surely unlikely that she would go out of her way to
  pick a quarrel with the powerful British Empire. If she made war and lost it,
  her commerce would be set back and her rising colonial empire destroyed. If
  she won it, it was difficult to see where she could hope for the spoils. We
  could not give her greater facilities for trade than she had already. We
  could not give her habitable white colonies, for she would find it impossible
  to take possession of them in the face of the opposition of the inhabitants.
  An indemnity she could never force from us. Some coaling stations and
  possibly some tropical colonies, of which latter she already possessed
  abundance, were the most that she could hope for. Would such a prize as that
  be worth the risk attending such a war? To me it seemed that there could be
  only one answer to such a question.</p>

  <p>I am still of the same opinion. But unhappily the affairs of nations are
  not always regulated by reason, and occasionally a country may be afflicted
  by a madness which sets all calculations at defiance. Then, again, I had
  looked upon the matter too much as between Great Britain and Germany. I had
  not sufficiently considered the chance of our being drawn in against our will
  in order to safeguard Belgium, or in order to stop the annihilation of
  France. It was so perfectly clear that Britain by her treaty obligations, and
  by all that is human and honourable, would fight if Belgium were invaded,
  that one could not conceive Germany taking such a step with any other
  expectation. And yet what we could not conceive is exactly what happened, for
  it is clear that the delusions as to our degeneration in character had really
  persuaded the Germans that the big cowardly fellow would stand by with folded
  arms and see his little friend knocked about by the bully. The whole idea
  showed an extraordinary ignorance of the British psychology, but absurd as it
  was, it was none the less the determining influence at the critical moment of
  the world's history. The influence of the lie is one of the strangest
  problems of life&mdash;that which is not continually influences that which
  is. Within one generation imagination and misrepresentation have destroyed
  the Boer republics and Imperial Germany.</p>

  <p>One of my most remarkable pre-war experiences, which influenced my mind
  deeply, was my participation in the amateur motor race called the Prince
  Henry Competition. It was rather a reliability test than a race, for the car
  had to go some 150 miles a day on an average at its own pace, but marks were
  taken off for all involuntary stoppages, breakdowns, accidents, etc. Each
  owner had to drive his own car, and I had entered my little 16 horse-power
  landaulette. There were about forty British cars and fifty German, so that
  the procession was a very considerable one. Starting from Homburg, the
  watering-place, our route ran through North Germany, then by steamer to
  Southampton, up to Edinburgh and back to London by devious ways.</p>

  <p>The competition had been planned in Germany, and there can be no doubt in
  looking back that a political purpose underlay it. The idea was to create a
  false entente by means of sport, which would react upon the very serious
  political development in the wind, namely, the occupation of Agadir on the
  south-west coast of Morocco, which occurred on our second day out. As Prince
  Henry, who organized and took part in the competition, was also head of the
  German Navy, it is of course obvious that he knew that the <i>Panther</i> was
  going to Agadir, and that there was a direct connection between the two
  events, in each of which he was a leading actor. It was a clumsy bit of stage
  management and could not possibly have been effective.</p>

  <p>The peculiarity of the tour was that each car had an officer of the army
  or navy of the other nation as a passenger, to check the marks. Thus my wife
  and I had the' enforced company for nearly three weeks of Count Carmer,
  Rittmeister of Breslau Cuirassiers, who began by being stiff and inhuman, but
  speedily thawed and became a very good fellow. The arrangements were very
  peculiar. Some British paper&mdash;the "Mail" if I remember right&mdash;had
  stated that the Competition was really a device to pass a number of German
  officers through Great Britain in order to spy out the land. I think there
  may have been some truth in this, as our good Count when we reached London
  went off to a hotel down in the East End, which seemed a curious thing for a
  wealthy Junker to do. This criticism seems to have annoyed the Kaiser, and he
  said&mdash;or so it was reported&mdash;that none but junior officers should
  go as observers. I should think that ours was the senior of the lot, and the
  others were mostly captains and lieutenants. On the other hand, the British
  Government, out of compliment to Prince Henry, had appointed the very best
  men available as observers. If there had been a sudden crisis over Agadir,
  and Germany had impounded us all, it would have been a national disaster and
  would have made a difference in a European war. Speaking from an imperfect
  memory, I can recall that we had General Grierson, Charles Munro, Rawlinson,
  I think, Captain&mdash;now General&mdash;Swinton of Tanks fame, Delme
  Ratcliffe, Colonel&mdash;now General&mdash;Holman, Major&mdash;now
  General&mdash;Thwaites, and many other notables both of the Army and
  Navy.</p>

  <p>From the first relations were strained. There was natural annoyance when
  these senior officers found that their opposite numbers were youngsters of no
  experience. Then, again, at Cologne and Munster I understand that the German
  military did not show the proper courtesies, and certainly the hospitality
  which the whole party received until we reached England was negligible. The
  Germans themselves must have felt ashamed of the difference. Personally the
  competitors were not a bad set of fellows, though there were some bounders
  among them. We were not all above criticism ourselves.</p>

  <p>Of the Competition itself little need be said, as I have treated the
  sporting side of it elsewhere. Some of the Germans seemed to me to be a
  little mad, for they seemed consumed by the idea that it was a race, whereas
  it mattered nothing who was at the head of the procession or who at the tail,
  so long as you did the allotted distance in the allotted time. I saw a German
  bound into his car after some stoppage: "How many ahead? Three Englishmen!
  Forwards! Forwards!" he cried. They barged into each other, dashed furiously
  round corners, and altogether behaved in a wild fashion, while our sedate old
  fellows pursued their course in a humdrum fashion and saved their marks.
  There were, however, some good fellows among the Germans. I have not
  forgotten how one of them, anonymously, used to place flowers in my wife's
  corner every morning.</p>

  <p>But as an attempt at an entente it was a great failure. The British
  officer who was compelled to spend weeks with a car-load of Germans was not
  expansive and refused to be digested. Some of the Germans, too, became
  disagreeable. I saw a large German car&mdash;they were all Benz and Mercédès,
  generally 70-80 horse-power&mdash;edge a little British car right off the
  road on to the grass track beside it. The driver of the British car was a
  pretty useful middle-weight boxer, but he kept his temper or there might have
  been trouble. There was very little love lost on either side, though I, as
  one of the few German-speaking competitors, did my very best to bring about a
  more cordial atmosphere. But war was in the air. Both sides spoke of it.
  Several of the British officers were either of the Intelligence branch, or
  had special German experience, and they were unanimous about it. My attempts
  towards peace were rejected. "The only thing I want to do with these people
  is to fight them," said Colonel Holman. "Same here," said the officer with
  him. It was a deep antagonism on either side. They were not only sure of the
  war, but of the date. "It will be on the first pretext after the Kiel Canal
  is widened." The Kiel Canal was finished in June, 1914, and war came in
  August, so that they were not far wrong. There was some little German chaff
  on the subject. "Wouldn't you like one of these little islands?" I heard a
  German say as we steamed out past Heligoland and the Frisian Belt.</p>

  <p>It was this experience which first made me take the threat of war
  seriously, but I could have persuaded myself that I was misled, had it not
  been that I read soon afterwards Bernhardi's book "Germany and the Next War."
  I studied it carefully and I put my impression of it into print in an article
  called "England and the Next War," which appeared in the "Fortnightly Review"
  in the summer of 1913. It lies before me now, as I write, and it is
  interesting to see how, as I projected my mind and my imagination over the
  possibilities of the future, I read much aright and some little wrong.</p>

  <p>I began by epitomizing Bernhardi's whole argument, and showing that,
  however we might disagree with it, we were bound to take it seriously, since
  he was undoubtedly a leader of a certain class of thought in his own
  country&mdash;that very military class which was now predominant. I demurred
  at his assumption that the German Army in equal numbers must overcome the
  French. "It is possible," I remarked, "that even so high an authority as
  General Bernhardi has not entirely appreciated how Germany has been the
  teacher of the world in military matters and how thoroughly her pupils have
  responded to that teaching. That attention to detail, perfection of
  arrangement for mobilization, and careful preparation which have won German
  victories in the past may now be turned against her, and she may find that
  others can equal her in her own virtues." I then examined Bernhardi's alleged
  grievances against Great Britain, and showed how baseless they were, and how
  little they could hope to gain by victory. I quoted one poisonous sentence
  "Even English attempts at a <i>rapprochement</i> must not blind us to the
  real situation. We may at most use them to delay the necessary and inevitable
  war until we may fairly imagine that we have some prospect of success." "This
  last sentence," I remarked, "must come home to some of us who have worked in
  the past for a better feeling between the two countries."</p>

  <p>I then gave an epitome of Bernhardi's plan of campaign as outlined in
  charming frankness in his volume, and I sketched out how far we were in a
  position to meet it and what were the joints in our armour. My general
  conclusions may be given as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. That invasion was not a serious danger and that the thought of it
  should not deflect our plans.</p>

  <p>2. That if invasion becomes impossible then any force like the
  Territorials unless it is prepared to go abroad becomes useless.</p>

  <p>3. That we should not have conscription save as a very, last resource,
  since it is against the traditions of our people.</p>

  <p>4. That our real danger lay in the submarine and in the airship, which
  could not be affected by blockade.</p>

  <p>In discussing the submarine I said: "What exact effect a swarm of
  submarines, lying off the mouth of the Channel and the Irish Sea, would
  produce upon the victualling of these islands is a problem which is beyond my
  conjecture. Other ships besides the British would be likely to be destroyed,
  and international complications would probably follow. I cannot imagine that
  such a fleet would entirely, or even to a very large extent, cut off our
  supplies. But it is certain that they would have the effect of considerably
  raising the price of whatever did reach us. Therefore, we should suffer
  privation, though not necessarily such privation as would compel us to make
  terms. From the beginning of the war every home source would naturally be
  encouraged, and it is possible that before our external supplies were
  seriously decreased, our internal ones might be well on the way to make up
  the deficiency."</p>

  <p>This did, I think, roughly outline the actual course of events.</p>

  <p>5. That the submarines would affect military operations should we send a
  force to France or Belgium.</p>

  <p>6. That therefore the Channel Tunnel was a vital necessity.</p>

  <p>7. That all unnecessary expenses should be at once cut down, so that
  British credit should stand at its highest when the strain came.</p>

  <p>These are only the general conclusions. The article attracted some
  attention, but I do not suppose that it had any actual influence upon the
  course of events. To reinforce it I wrote an imaginary episode called
  "Danger" in the "Strand Magazine," to show how even a small Power might
  possibly bring us to our knees by the submarine. It was singularly prophetic,
  for not only did it outline the actual situation as it finally developed, but
  it contained many details, the zig-zagging of the merchant ships, the use of
  submarine guns, the lying for the night on sandy bottoms, and so
  forth&mdash;exactly as they occurred. The article was sent round in proof to
  a number of high naval officers, mostly retired, for their opinions. I am
  afraid that the printed results, which I will not be so cruel as to quote,
  showed that it was as well they were retired, since they had no sense of the
  possibilities of the naval warfare of the future.</p>

  <p>One result of my "Fortnightly" article was that General Henry Wilson, late
  Chief of the Staff College as he then was, desired to see me to
  cross-question me, and a meeting was arranged at the house of Colonel
  Sackville-West, Major Swinton being also present. There, after luncheon,
  General Wilson machine-gunned me with questions for about an hour. He was
  fierce and explosive in his manner, and looked upon me, no doubt, as one of
  those pestilential laymen who insist upon talking of things they don't
  understand. As I could give reasons for my beliefs, I refused to be squashed,
  and when the interview was over I went straight down to the Athenaeum Club
  and wrote it all down from memory. It makes such curious reading that I give
  it exactly as I reported it that day, in dialogue, with one or two comments
  from Colonel Sackville-West. After saying with some asperity that I had made
  many statements which I could not substantiate, and so might give the public
  far too optimistic a view of the position, he said: "Why do you say that we
  would never pay an indemnity to Germany?"</p>

  <p>A. C. D. It is a matter of individual opinion. I go upon history and upon
  the spirit of our people.</p>

  <p>GEN. W. Had not France equal spirit in 1870? How is it that they paid an
  indemnity?</p>

  <p>A. C. D. Because Germany was sitting on the top of them, and she had to
  pay to get from under. GEN. W. Why may she not sit on the top of us?</p>

  <p>A. C. D. Because we live on an island and she cannot occupy us in the same
  way.</p>

  <p>COLONEL S.-W. I believe a little pressure on London would cause us to pay
  an indemnity.</p>

  <p>A. C. D. The man who suggested it would get hanged.</p>

  <p>COLONEL S.-W. They would hang the man who made the war.</p>

  <p>A. C. D. No, they would back him but hang the traitor.</p>

  <p>GEN. W. You say that they would gain nothing by war. What about the
  carrying trade of the world?</p>

  <p>A. C. D. The carrying trade depends on economic questions and upon
  geographical situation. For example, the Norwegians, who have no fleet, are
  one of the principal carriers.</p>

  <p>GEN. W. At least they could starve us out if they held the seas.</p>

  <p>A. C. D. Well, that is where my tunnel would come in; but of course I am
  entirely with you as to the need of holding the seas.</p>

  <p>GEN. W. Well, now, you admit that we must go to the help of France?</p>

  <p>A. C. D. Certainly.</p>

  <p>GEN. W. But what can six divisions do?</p>

  <p>A. C. D. Well, my point is that six divisions with a tunnel are better
  than six divisions without a tunnel.</p>

  <p>COLONEL S.-W. If we have a tunnel we must have a force worth sending to
  send through it.</p>

  <p>A. C. D. If you are going to couple the tunnel with compulsory service,
  you will get neither one nor the other.</p>

  <p>GEN. W. I think, so far as submarines go, that the British patrols would
  make it a very desperate service. Some desperate man might get his boat
  through.</p>

  <p>A. C. D. Some desperate man might command a flotilla and get it
  through.</p>

  <p>GEN. W. Many things seem possible theoretically which cannot be done in
  practice, but no doubt there is a danger there. In your view the Territorials
  are simply a support for the fighting Army?</p>

  <p>A. C. D. Yes.</p>

  <p>GEN. W. But they are too untrained to go into action.</p>

  <p>A. C. D. They would be reserves and have time to train.</p>

  <p>GEN. W. Your idea of troops coming back in case of a raid through the
  tunnel is impossible. You could not withdraw troops in that way from their
  positions.</p>

  <p>A. C. D. Well, with all respect, I do not believe either in a raid or in
  an invasion.</p>

  <p>GEN. W. A war with Germany would be short and sharp&mdash;seven months
  would see it finished.</p>

  <p>A. C. D. You mean, no doubt, the continental part. I could imagine the
  naval part lasting ten years.</p>

  <p>COLONEL S.-W. If your fleet was crushed, you would have to give in.</p>

  <p>A. C. D. A fleet can never be annihilated as an army is. There always
  remain scattered forces which can go on fighting. I don't think we need give
  in because the fleet Is crushed.</p>

  <p>GEN. W. You don't suppose that the Englishman is a better soldier by
  nature than the Frenchman or the German?</p>

  <p>A. C. D. At least he is a volunteer.</p>

  <p>GEN. W. How would that affect the matter?</p>

  <p>A. C. D. I think he would rally better if he were beaten. There would be
  no end to his resistance, like the North in the American War.</p>

  <p>GEN. W. Don't you think, if war were declared with Germany, that the
  public, fearing an invasion, would clamour against any regular troops going
  abroad at all?</p>

  <p>A. C. D. I think the public would leave it to the War Office. In the South
  African War they allowed our troops to go 6,000 miles away, and yet there was
  a danger of a European coalition.</p>

  <p>COLONEL S.-W. But our Navy was supreme then. A. C. D. Not against a
  coalition.</p>

  <p>GEN. W. When Cervera's fleet got loose, the Americans would not allow
  their troops to embark. COLONEL S.-W. Even the Pacific coast was terrified.
  A. C. D. Well, surely that is the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. COLONEL S.-W.
  Still, the fact remains.</p>

  <p>GEN. W. If we could send fifteen divisions we could stop a war.</p>

  <p>A. C. D. But that means compulsory service. GEN. W. Why not?</p>

  <p>A. C. D. Because I am convinced that you could not get it. I have twice
  stood for Parliament, and I am sure no candidate would have a chance on such
  a platform.</p>

  <p>GEN. W. Our descendants will say, "Well, you saw the danger, and yet you
  made no effort."</p>

  <p>A. C. D. Well, we have doubled our estimates. Surely that is an effort and
  must represent power somewhere.</p>

  <p>We parted quite good friends, but the General's evident desire to rope me
  in as a compulsory-service man was vain. I venture to think that Lord
  Roberts' efforts in that direction were a great mistake, and that if he had
  devoted the same great energy to the line of least resistance, which was the
  Territorial force, we could have had half a million in the ranks when war
  broke out.</p>

  <p>From the time that I was convinced by my experiences at the Prince Henry
  race and by carefully reading German literature that a war was really
  brewing, I naturally began to speculate as to the methods of attack and of
  defence. I have an occasional power of premonition, psychic rather than
  intellectual, which exercises itself beyond my own control, and which when it
  really comes is never mistaken. The danger seems to be that my own prejudice
  or reasonings may interfere with it. On this occasion I saw as clearly as
  possible what the course of a naval war between England and Germany would be.
  I had no doubt at all that our greatest danger&mdash;a desperately real
  one&mdash;was that they would use their submarines in order to sink our food
  ships, and that we might be starved into submission. Even if we won every
  fleet action, this unseen enemy would surely bring us to our knees. It all
  worked out in exact detail in my mind&mdash;so much so that Admiral Capelle
  mentioned my name afterwards in the Reichstag, and said that only I had
  accurately seen the economic form which the war would assume. This was
  perhaps true, so far as the economic side went, but Sir Percy Scott had
  spoken with far more authority than I on the growing power of the submarines
  in warfare.</p>

  <p>I was made very uneasy by this line of thought, and all the more so
  because I asked several naval officers for some reassurance and could get
  none. One of them, I remember, said that it was all right because we should
  put a boom across the Channel, which seemed to me like saying that you could
  keep eels from going down a river by laying a plank across it. Among others I
  spoke to Captain Beatty, as he then was, whom I met at a weekend party at
  Knole, and though he could give me no reassurance about submarines he
  impressed me by his vivid and alert personality, and I felt that a Navy with
  such men in command was safe enough where fighting was concerned. It could
  not, however, fill the platter if there was no loaf to place upon it. I
  pondered the matter, and could only see three palliatives, and no cure.</p>

  <p>The first was to encourage home growth by a bonus or by a tariff. But here
  our accursed party politics barred the way, as I had learned only too clearly
  after spending a thousand pounds in fighting the Hawick Burghs in order to
  get some form of agricultural protection.</p>

  <p>The second was to meet submarines by submarine food-carriers. I think that
  this may prove the final solution, but the ships were not yet planned, far
  less launched.</p>

  <p>The third and most obvious was the Channel Tunnel, or tunnels for
  preference. I had supported this scheme for years, and felt that as a nation
  we had made fools of ourselves over it, exactly as we did over the Suez
  Canal. If we were an island the size of the Wight such timidity would be
  intelligible, but the idea of a great country being invaded through a hole in
  the ground twenty-seven miles long seemed to me the most fantastic possible,
  while the practical use of the tunnel both for trade and for tourists was
  obvious. But now I saw that far more serious issues were at stake, for if we
  were held up by submarines, and if France was either neutral or our ally, we
  could land all the Eastern portion of our supplies, which is not
  inconsiderable, at Marseilles and so run them safely to London without
  breaking bulk. When I put this forward in the press some military critic
  said: "But if the submarines could hold up the Channel they could hold up the
  Mediterranean also." This did not seem a good argument, because Germany was
  the possible enemy and it had no port in the Mediterranean, while the radius
  of submarine action at that time was not great enough to allow them to come
  so far. So strongly did I feel about the need for a Channel Tunnel in view of
  the coming war that I remember writing three memoranda and sending one to the
  Army, one to the Navy, and one to the Council of Imperial Defence. Of course
  I got no satisfaction of any kind, but Captain&mdash;now
  General&mdash;Swinton, who was acting as secretary to the latter body, told
  me that he had read my paper and that it had "set him furiously thinking." I
  wrote to Lord Northcliffe also, without avail. I felt as if, like Solomon
  Eagle, I could go through London with a burning brazier on my head, if I
  could only get people to understand the need of the tunnel. The whole
  discussion had taken the utterly impossible and useless turn towards
  compulsory service, and the things which were practical and vital were being
  missed.</p>

  <p>I spoke in public about the tunnel when I could, and on one occasion, just
  a year before the war, I raised a discussion in "The Times," Mr. Ronald
  McNeill giving me an opening by declaring in the House that the project was a
  crazy one. There was also about that time a meeting in the City at the Cannon
  Street Hotel, where a very influential body of men supported the scheme. My
  speech, as reported next day in "The Times" in a very condensed form, ran
  thus:</p>

  <p>"Sir A. Conan Doyle said there were possibilities in a future war that
  rendered it a matter of vital national importance that the tunnel should be
  constructed without delay. The danger was that we were getting five-sixths of
  our food supplies from abroad, and submarine craft were developing remarkable
  qualities which were not generally realized. They were able to avoid a
  blockade squadron, and to pass under a patrol line of torpedo-boats without
  their existence being even suspected. If they were sent to the line of our
  commerce and told to sink a ship, they would torpedo that ship for a
  certainty. What would be the condition of our food supplies if there were
  twenty-five hostile submarines off the Kent coast and twenty-five in the
  Irish Channel? The price of food would reach an almost prohibitive figure.
  The Military Correspondent of 'The Times' was a great opponent of the Channel
  Tunnel and was always running it down and mocking at it. But the other day he
  wrote an article on the Mediterranean, and, forgetting the Channel Tunnel, he
  said: 'We must remember that more than half the food supply of this country
  now comes from the Mediterranean.' If it came through the Mediterranean, and
  if it got to Marseilles and we had the Channel Tunnel, it was only a matter
  of management to get it through to London."</p>

  <p>The Military Correspondent of "The Times," who was presumably Colonel
  Repington, had an article next day deriding the scheme, and making light of
  my picture of submarines in the Channel. Well, we have lived to see them, and
  I wish my argument had proved less sound. Colonel Repington has proved
  himself so clear-sighted an observer and commentator in the last war that he
  can be forgiven if, for once, he was on the wrong side; but if the Channel
  Tunnel had been put in hand at once after that meeting and rushed to
  completion, I wonder if it would be an exaggeration to say that a hundred
  million pounds would have been saved, while what it would have meant in
  evacuating wounded and in communications in stormy weather could not be
  represented in words. Imagine the convenience and saving of time and labour
  when munitions could be started at Woolwich and landed at Amiens without a
  break.</p>

  <p>It has been argued that if the tunnel had been built the first swoop of
  the Germans would have brought them to the end of it and it would have been
  destroyed. But this will not bear examination, for it is based on the idea
  that we should have left the end unprotected. It would as a matter of fact
  have been the most natural fortress in the world, the strongest and the
  strangest, for it would be the only fortress where you could increase or
  withdraw your garrison at will, and introduce any supplies at any time you
  might desire. A very few forts and trenches on those convenient chalk slopes
  with their wide, smooth fields of fire, would hold the tunnel. In stretching
  their right wing as far as Amiens the Germans were very nearly cut off, and
  it was by a very great effort that Von Kluck saved it. If instead of Amiens
  he had reached Calais with sufficient forces for a siege he would have been
  unable to get away. An argument based upon the supposition that we should
  leave the mouth of the tunnel in Picardy as unprotected as the mouth of a
  coal mine in Kent is surely an unsound one. Now, in 1924, they are talking of
  building the tunnel. I wonder what our descendants will think of the whole
  business&mdash;probably what we think of the men who opposed the Suez
  Canal.</p>

  <p>It is a most singular thing that our Navy, with so many practical and
  clever men in it, with a genius like Winston Churchill at the head, and
  another genius like Lord Fisher in continual touch, did not realize, until
  faced with actual results, some of the most important and surely most obvious
  points in connection with naval warfare. It came, I suppose, from the iron
  bonds of tradition, and that there were so many things to supervise, but the
  fact remains that a perfectly overwhelming case could be made out against the
  higher brain department of our senior service. A war with Germany was
  anticipated, and, as the public imagined, was prepared for, but save for the
  ship-building programme, which left us a narrow margin of safety, and for the
  concentration of our distant squadrons into British waters and the
  elimination of many useless craft which consumed good crews, what evidence is
  there of foresight? It was known, for example, that Scapa Flow and Cromarty
  were the two possible anchorages of the Fleet in a long-distance blockade,
  and yet no attempt had been made to mount guns or to net the entrances, so
  that for months there was a possibility of a shattering disaster; and
  Jellicoe, with the prudence which always distinguished him, had to put to sea
  every night lest his fleet should present a sitter to a torpedo attack. We
  showed intelligence in sticking always to the heavier guns, but our mines
  were wretchedly inefficient, our range-finders were very inferior, and our
  shells proved to have less penetrating and explosive force.</p>

  <p>But the worst thing of all was the utter want of imagination shown in
  picturing the conditions of modern naval warfare, which must surely be done
  before just preparation can be made. It was clear that the effect of armour
  protection on one side, and of the mine and the torpedo on the other, would
  mean that if the ship floated there would be little loss of life, but that
  she was very likely to sink, in which case the whole crew would go. Therefore
  provision must be made for the saving of every one on board. The authorities,
  however, seem to have completely underrated the dangers of the mine and
  torpedo, and centred their attention upon the surface naval action, where
  boats, being inflammable, would be a danger and where in any case they would
  probably be shot to pieces before the end of the fight. The pre-war idea was
  to throw the boats and every other wooden object overboard before the action
  began.</p>

  <p>The very first day of naval warfare showed the importance of the mine, as
  on August 5 the Germans laid a minefield outside the mouth of the Thames
  which nearly blew up their own returning Ambassador, Prince Lichnowsky, and
  did actually cause the destruction of one of our light vessels, the Amphion.
  It was clear that one of the great dangers of the sea lay in this direction,
  and it soon became equally clear that nothing had been done to think out some
  defence. Foresight would have anticipated this situation and would have set
  the brains of the younger naval officers at work devising some remedy. As a
  matter of fact the real solution had been roughly indicated by Colonel
  Repington in "Blackwood's Magazine" some four years before, in which he spoke
  of a device called "the otter" used by poachers for gathering up lines, and
  suggested that something of the sort would gather up the lines to which mines
  are attached. After three years of war, and very many preventable losses,
  including the great battleship <i>Audacious</i>, the splendid auxiliary
  cruiser <i>Laurentic</i> with six millions in gold on board, and many other
  fine vessels, the cure was found in the paravane, which was an adaptation of
  "the otter." After its adoption ships could cruise over a minefield with
  little fear of injury, and our squadrons were no longer confined to the
  narrow lanes which had been swept clear.</p>

  <p>I was from the beginning greatly impressed by this danger, and I wrote
  early in the war both to the papers and the Admiralty, but my device was
  crude and clumsy compared to what was actually done. My idea was something
  like a huge trident or toasting fork which could be hauled up on the bows
  when the waters were safe, but could be pushed forward and dip down in front
  when there was danger, so as to explode any mine before the ship could
  actually reach it. Such an apparatus would be better than nothing, but still
  I quite admit that it was an inadequate solution of the problem. But at least
  it was an attempt&mdash;and no other attempt was visible for years
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>But the particular instance of mines was a small consideration beside the
  huge permanent incredible fact that while it was clear that a battleship
  could suddenly go down like a kettle with a hole in it, dragging a thousand
  men down with it, there was no provision by which the lives of these men
  could be saved. It was really unbelievable until there came the terrible
  example when the three cruisers, <i>Hogue, Aboukir</i>, and <i>Cressy</i>,
  were all put down in a single day. A young German lieutenant with twenty men
  had caused us more loss than we suffered at Trafalgar. To learn how the
  helpless men had nowhere to turn, and how they clung on to floating petrol
  tins as their only safety, should have been terrible reading to those whose
  want of foresight had brought about such a situation. It was a dreadful
  object-lesson, and there seemed no reason why it should not be often
  repeated. I had already commented in the press upon the situation which would
  arise in a general action, with ships sinking all round and no boats. I
  suggested that it might be possible to drop the boats before battle and to
  have them in tow of a steam launch which could bring them up if needed. Of
  course I saw all the difficulties and dangers of such a course, but if one
  took the word of the sailors that the boats were a danger on board then I
  could think of no other way of working it. When I wrote about it, several
  naval critics, notably Commander Jane, rapped me hard over the knuckles, and
  deplored the intrusion of landsmen into matters of which they knew nothing.
  But when this great catastrophe occurred, I realized that the protection must
  be individual rather than collective, and that one must ventilate the thing
  in public with such warmth that the authorities would be compelled to do
  something. If wooden boats were impossible, what about indiarubber collars
  which would at least hold the poor fellows above the waves until some help
  could reach them? I opened an agitation in several papers, notably the "Daily
  Mail" and the "Daily Chronicle," and within a very few days&mdash;either
  <i>post hoc</i> or <i>propter hoc</i>&mdash;there was a rush order for a
  quarter of a million collars which could be blown out by the men themselves,
  and which were henceforth to be part of their vital equipment. The "Hampshire
  Telegraph," the best informed of naval papers, said:</p>

  <p>"The Navy has to thank Sir Conan Doyle for the new life-saving apparatus
  the Admiralty are supplying. Some weeks ago he asked if it was not possible
  to manufacture a simple and easily inflatable life-belt, and, thanks to the
  enterprise of a rubber-manufacturing firm, a swimming collar is now being
  supplied to the men of the fleet in the North Sea as fast as they can be
  turned out. The apparatus is exceedingly simple. It is made of rubber,
  enclosed in a stout web casing, and weighs complete under three ounces. It
  can be carried in the pocket and can be inflated in position round a man's
  neck in about ten seconds. Its effect is to keep the man's head above water
  indefinitely. There is little doubt that this swimming collar will result in
  the saving of many lives, and the Admiralty are to be congratulated upon the
  promptitude with which they have adopted the suggestion of Sir Conan
  Doyle."</p>

  <p>I was by no means satisfied with this, however; for, however useful in
  calm water on a summer day, it was clear that men would soon perish by
  exhaustion in a rough winter sea, and the collars would only prolong their
  agony. If wooden boats took up too much room and were inflammable, how about
  indiarubber collapsible boats? I wrote in the "Daily Mail":</p>

  <p>"We can spare and replace the ships. We cannot spare the men. They
  <i>must</i> be saved, and this is how to save them. There is nothing so
  urgent as this. We can view all future disasters with equanimity if the
  ship's company has only a fair chance for its life." Of course one recognized
  that there were some situations where nothing would avail. The
  <i>Formidable</i> was a case in point, which was torpedoed near Plymouth on
  January 1, 1915. Captain Miller, of the Brixham trawler which rescued seventy
  men, said to the "Daily Mail" representative that I was doing a national work
  in my efforts to get better life-saving appliances for the men of the Navy.
  He remarked that in calm weather collapsible boats would be of use, but they
  could not possibly have lived in the seas which were breaking over the
  <i>Formidable's</i> whaler. The weather here was exceptional, and one cannot
  hope to provide for every case.</p>

  <p>The final result of the agitation was the provision of collars, of safety
  waistcoats, and (as I believe) of a better supply of boats. I need hardly say
  that I never received a word of acknowledgment or thanks from the Admiralty.
  One is not likely to be thanked by a Government department for supplementing
  its work. But it may be that some poor seaman struggling in the water sent me
  his good wish, and those are the thanks that I desired. There was nothing in
  the war which moved me more than the thought of the helpless plight of these
  gallant men who were sacrificed when they could so easily have been
  saved.</p>

  <p>Like every man with Irish blood in his veins, I was deeply moved by the
  tragedy of Ireland during the war&mdash;her fine start, the want of tact with
  which it was met, her sad relapse, and finally her failure to rise to the
  great world crisis.</p>

  <p>A letter which I value very much is one which I received from Major
  William Redmond just before his lamented death. What an abyss of evil Ireland
  would have been saved from had the spirit of this letter been the inspiration
  upon which she acted!</p>

  <p class="letter">18.12.16.<br>
  <br>
  DEAR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE,&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  It was very good of you to write to me and I value very much the expression
  of your opinion. There are a great many Irishmen to-day who feel that out of
  this War we should try and build up a new Ireland. The trouble is men are so
  timid about meeting each other half-way. It would be a fine memorial to the
  men who have died so splendidly, if we could over their graves build up a
  bridge between the North and South. I have been thinking a lot about this
  lately in France&mdash;no one could help doing so when one finds that the two
  sections from Ireland are actually side by side holding the trenches! No
  words&mdash;not even your own&mdash;could do justice to the splendid action
  of the new Irish soldiers. They never have flinched. They never give trouble,
  and they are steady and sober. Had poor Kettle lived he would have given the
  world a wonderful account of things out there. I saw a good deal of Kettle,
  and we had many talks of the Unity we both hoped would come out of the War. I
  have been an extreme Nationalist all my life, and if others as extreme,
  perhaps, on the other side will only come half-way, then I believe,
  impossible as it may seem, we should be able to hit upon a plan to satisfy
  the Irish sentiment and the Imperial sentiment at one and the same time. I am
  sure you can do very much, as you already have done, in this direction. I am
  going back for Christmas with the men I have become attached very deeply to
  during the last two years.<br>
  <br>
  With many thanks for your letter,<br>
  Yours very truly,<br>
  WILLIAM REDMOND.<br>
  Major.</p>

  <p>If this letter, even now, were posted up by the Free State and Northern
  Governments at every cross-roads of Ireland the spirit of Willie Redmond
  might heal the wounds of the unhappy country.</p>

     id="ch-27"></a>XXVII &mdash; A REMEMBRANCE OF THE DARK YEARS</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">Nightmares of the Morning&mdash;The Civilian
  Reserve&mdash;The Volunteers&mdash;Domestic Life in War Time&mdash;German
  Prisoners&mdash;Cipher to our Prisoners&mdash;Sir John French&mdash;Empress
  Eugenie&mdash;Miracle Town&mdash;Armour&mdash;Our Tragedy.</p><br>

  <p class="first">I CAN never forget, and our descendants can never imagine,
  the strange effect upon the mind which was produced by seeing the whole
  European fabric drifting to the edge of the chasm with absolute uncertainty
  as to what would happen when it toppled over. Military surprises, starvation,
  revolution, bankruptcy&mdash;no one knew what so unprecedented an episode
  would produce. It was all so evidently preventable, and yet it was so madly
  impossible to prevent it, for the Prussians had stuck their monkey-wrench
  into the machinery and it would no longer work. As a rule one has wild dreams
  and wakes to sanity, but on those mornings I left sanity when I woke and
  found myself in a world of nightmare dreams.</p>

  <p>On August 4, when war seemed assured, I had a note from Mr. Goldsmith, a
  plumber in the village: "There is a feeling in Crowborough that something
  should be done." This made me laugh at first, but presently I thought more
  seriously of it. After all, Crowborough was one of a thousand villages, and
  we might be planning and acting for all. Therefore I had notices rapidly
  printed. I distributed them and put them at road corners, and the same
  evening (August 4) we held a village meeting and started the Volunteers, a
  force which soon grew to 200,000 men.</p>

  <p>The old Volunteers had become extinct when the Territorials had been
  organised some ten or twelve years before. But this new force which I
  conceived was to be a universal one, where every citizen, young and old,
  should be trained to arms&mdash;a great stockpot into which the nation could
  dip and draw its needs. We named ourselves the Civilian Reserve. No one, I
  reflected, could be the worse in such days for being able to drill and to
  shoot, or for being assembled in organized units. Government was too
  preoccupied to do anything, and we must show initiative for ourselves. After
  I had propounded my scheme, I signed the roll myself, and 120 men did the
  same. Those were the first men in the Volunteer Force. Next evening we
  assembled at the drill-hall, found out who could drill us, chose our
  non-commissioned officers and set to work to form ourselves into an efficient
  company. Gillette, my American actor friend, had got stranded in England, and
  he was an interested spectator on this occasion. For the time being I took
  command.</p>

  <p>I had notified the War Office what we had done and asked for official
  sanction. We were careful not to stand in the way of recruiting and
  determined to admit none who could reasonably join up at once. When the plan
  began to work I wrote a description of our methods to "The Times." As a
  consequence I received requests for our rules and methods from 1,200 towns
  and villages. My secretary and I worked all day getting these off, and in
  many cases the inquiries led to the formation of similar companies.</p>

  <p>For about a fortnight all went well. We drilled every day, though we had
  no weapons. At the end of that time there came a peremptory order from the
  War Office: "All unauthorized bodies to be at once disbanded." Unquestioning
  and cheerful obedience is the first law in time of war. The company was on
  parade. I read out the telegram and then said: "Right turn! Dismiss!" With
  this laconic order the Civilian Reserve dissolved for ever.</p>

  <p>But it had a speedy and glorious resurrection. There was a central body in
  London with some remote connection with the old Volunteer Force. Lord
  Des-borough was chairman of this, and there could not have been a better man.
  The Government put the formation of a Volunteer Force into the charge of this
  committee, to which I was elected. Mr. Percy Harris was the secretary and
  showed great energy. I wrote to all the 1,200 applicants referring them to
  this new centre, and we, the Crowborough body, now became the Crowborough
  Company of the Sixth Royal Sussex Volunteer Regiment. That we were the first
  company in the country was shown by the "Volunteer Gazette" when a prize was
  awarded for this distinction. Under its new shape Captain St. Quintin, who
  had been a soldier, became our leader, and Mr. Gresson and Mr. Druce, both of
  them famous cricketers, our lieutenants. Goldsmith was one of the sergeants,
  and I remained a full private for four years of war, and an extra half-year
  before we were demobilized. Our ranks fluctuated, for as the age limit of
  service gradually rose we passed many men into the regular Army, but we
  filled up with new recruits, and we were always about a hundred strong. Our
  drill and discipline were excellent, and when we received our rifles and
  bayonets we soon learned to use them, nor were our marching powers
  contemptible when one remembers that many of the men were in the fifties and
  even in the sixties. It was quite usual for us to march from Crowborough to
  Frant, with our rifles and equipment, to drill for a long hour in a heavy
  marshy field, and then to march back, singing all the way. It would be a good
  14 miles, apart from the drill.</p>

  <p>I have very pleasant recollections of that long period of service. I
  learned to know my neighbours who stood in the same ranks, and I hope that
  they also learned to know me as they could not otherwise. We had frequent
  camps, field days and inspections. On one occasion 8,000 of us were
  assembled, and I am bound to say that I have never seen a finer body of men,
  though they were rather of the police-constable than of the purely military
  type. The spirit was excellent, and I am sure that if we had had our chance
  we should have done well in action. But it was hard to know how to get the
  chance save in case of invasion. We were the remaining pivots of national
  life, and could only be spared for short periods or chaos would follow. But a
  week or two in case of invasion was well within our powers, and such a chance
  would have been eagerly hailed. No doubt our presence enabled the Government
  to strip the country of regular troops far more than they would have dared
  otherwise to do. Twice, as Repington's "Memoirs" show, there was a question
  of embodying us for active service, but in each case the emergency
  passed.</p>

  <p>I found the life of a private soldier a delightful one. To be led and not
  to lead was most restful, and so long as one's thoughts were bounded by the
  polishing of one's buttons and buckles, or the cleansing of one's rifle, one
  was quietly happy. In that long period I shared every phase of my companions'
  life. I have stood in the queue with my pannikin to get a welcome drink of
  beer, and I have slept in a bell-tent on a summer night with a Sussex yokel
  blissfully snoring upon each of my shoulders. Sometimes amusing situations
  arose. I remember a new adjutant arriving and reviewing us. When he got
  opposite to me in his inspection, his eyes were caught by my South African
  medal. "You have seen service, my man," said he. "Yes, sir," I answered. He
  was a little cocky fellow who might well have been my son so far as age went.
  When he had passed down the line, he said to our C.O., St. Quintin: "Who is
  that big fellow on the right of the rear rank?" "That's Sherlock Holmes,"
  said C.O. "Good Lord!" said the adjutant, "I hope he does not mind my 'My
  manning' him!" "He just loves it," said St. Quintin, which showed that he
  knew me.</p>

  <p>The other big factor which covered the whole period of the war, and some
  time after it, was my writing the History of the European campaign, which I
  published volume by volume under the name of "The British Campaign in France
  and Flanders." My information was particularly good, for I had organized a
  very extensive correspondence with the generals, who were by no means anxious
  for self-advertisement, but were, on the other hand, very keen that the deeds
  of their particular troops should have full justice done them. In this way I
  was able to be the first to describe in print the full battle-line with all
  the divisions, and even brigades in their correct places from Mons onwards to
  the last fight before the Armistice. When I think what a fuss was made in the
  old days when any Correspondent got the account of a single Colonial battle
  before his comrades, it is amazing to me that hardly a single paper ever
  commented, in reviewing these six successive volumes, upon the fact that I
  was really the only public source of supply of accurate and detailed
  information. I can only suppose that they could not believe it to be true. I
  had no help but only hindrance from the War Office, and everything I got was
  by means which were equally open to anyone else who took the trouble to
  organize them. Of course, I was bowdlerized and blue-pencilled by censors,
  but still the fact remains that a dozen great battle-lines were first charted
  by me. I have since read the official account so far as it has gone, and find
  little to change in my own, though the German and French records are now
  available to broaden the picture. For the moment war literature is out of
  fashion, and my war history, which reflects all the passion and pain of those
  hard days, has never come into its own. I would reckon it the greatest and
  most undeserved literary disappointment of my life if I did not know that the
  end is not yet and that it may mirror those great times to those who are to
  come.</p>

  <p>For the rest I had a great deal of literary propaganda work to do. Once it
  was the "To Arms!" pamphlet written in conjunction with Mr. Smith, soon to
  become Lord Birkenhead. Once again it was an appeal for our ill-used
  prisoners. Sometimes Norway, sometimes South America, always the United
  States, needed treatment. As to my special missions, those I treat in
  separate chapters.</p>

  <p>There are many small but very important details of domestic life during
  the war which have never been properly described, and could indeed best be
  described by a woman, for they were usually an invasion of her department.
  Our descendants will never realize how we were all registered and docketed
  and rationed, so that the State could give the least to and take the most
  from each of us. One had food-cards for practically everything, and the card
  only entitled you to get your meagre portion if it was to be had. Often it
  wasn't. I have been at a great lunch with half the grandees of the land, and
  the Prime Minister to speak. The fare was Irish stew and rice-pudding.</p>

  <p>What could man ask for more, but it will need another war to bring it
  round again. There was a pleasing uncertainty about all meals. There was
  always a sense of adventure and a wonder whether you would really get
  something. It all made for appetite. Then there were the darkened windows,
  the sharp knocking of the police if the blind emitted any light, the
  vexatious summons for very small offences, the pulling down of every blind on
  the railway trains. At night one never knew what evil bird was flying
  overhead or what foul egg would be dropped. Once, as we sat in the theatre at
  Eastbourne, the whirr of a Zeppelin was heard above us. Half the audience
  slipped out, the lights were put out, and the play was finished with candles
  on the stage. When I was lecturing in London the same thing happened, and I
  finished my lecture in the dark.</p>

  <p>Every one found themselves doing strange things. I was not only a private
  in the Volunteers, but I was a signaller and I was for a time number one of a
  machine gun. My wife started a home for Belgian refugees in Crow-borough. My
  son was a soldier, first, last, and all the time. My daughter Mary gave
  herself up altogether to public work, making shells at Vickers' and
  afterwards serving in a canteen. If I may quote a passage from my history:
  "Grotesque combinations resulted from the eagerness of all classes to lend a
  hand. An observer has described how a peer and a prize-fighter worked on the
  same bench at Woolwich, while titled ladies and young girls from cultured
  homes earned sixteen shillings a week at Erith and boasted in the morning of
  the number of shell-cases which they had turned, and finished in their hours
  of night-shift. Truly it had become a national war. Of all its memories none
  will be stranger than those of the peaceful middle-aged civilians who were
  seen eagerly reading books of elementary drill in order to prepare themselves
  to meet the most famous soldiers in Europe, or of the schoolgirls and matrons
  who donned blue blouses and by their united work surpassed the output of the
  great death factories of Essen."</p>

  <p>Every house had its vegetable garden and every poor man his allotment,
  that we might at the worst exist until we could win our peace. The want of
  sugar and the limitation of tea were the worst privations. My wife, greatly
  helped by a faithful servant, Jakeman, did wonders in saving food, and we
  always lived well within our legal rations. This did not save us once from a
  police raid, because some tea, sent us as a present from India, had arrived.
  We had already distributed a good deal of it, however, to our less fortunate
  neighbours, so we came well out of the matter.</p>

  <p>I have one singular memory in having to guard German prisoners at work.
  The Volunteers had a turn at this work, and we spent the night at Lewes
  Prison. In the early morning, dark and misty, we were mustered, and five
  prisoners handed over to each of us. Mine worked on a farm some 4 miles from
  the town, and thither I had to march them, walking behind them with my rifle
  on my shoulder. When I had reached the lonely country road, I thought I would
  get into human touch with these poor slouching wretches, who were still in
  their stained grey uniforms, and wearing their service caps with the bright
  red bands which formed a wonderful advertisement of the excellence of German
  dyes. I halted them, drew them up, and asked them their nationality Three
  were from Wurtemburg and two from Prussia. I asked the Wurtemburgers how long
  they had been prisoners. They said, "Fourteen months." "Then," said I, "you
  were taken by the Canadians at Ypres upon such and such a date." They were
  considerably astonished, since I was simply a second-line Tommy from their
  point of view. Of course, I had the details of the war very clearly in my
  mind, and I knew that our one big haul of Wurtemburgers had been on that
  occasion. To this day they must wonder how I knew. I shall not forget that
  day, for I stood for eight hours leaning on a rifle, amid drizzling rain,
  while in a little gap of the mist I watched those men loading carts with
  manure. I can answer for it that they were excellent workers, and they seemed
  civil, tractable fellows as well.</p>

  <p>It was in 1915 that I managed to establish a secret correspondence with
  the British prisoners at Magdeburg. It was not very difficult to do, and I
  dare say others managed it as well as I, but it had the effect of cheering
  them by a little authentic news, for at that time they were only permitted to
  see German newspapers. It came about in this way. A dear friend of my wife's,
  Miss Lily Loder Symonds, had a brother, Captain Willie Loder Symonds, of the
  Wiltshires, who had been wounded and taken in the stand of the 7th Brigade on
  the evening before Le Cateau. He was an ingenious fellow and had written home
  a letter which passed the German censor, because it seemed to consist in the
  description of a farm, but when read carefully it was clear that it was the
  conditions of himself and his comrades which he was discussing. It seemed to
  me that if a man used such an artifice he would be prepared for a similar one
  in a letter from home. I took one of my books, therefore, and beginning with
  the third chapter&mdash;I guessed the censor would examine the first&mdash;I
  put little needle-pricks under the various printed letters until I had
  spelled out all the news. I then sent the book and also a letter. In the
  letter I said that the book was, I feared, rather slow in the opening, but
  that from Chapter III onwards he might find it more interesting. That was as
  plain as I dared to make it. Loder Symonds missed the allusion altogether,
  but by good luck he showed the letter to Captain the Hon. Rupert Keppel, of
  the Guards, who had been taken at Landrecies. He smelled a rat, borrowed the
  book, and found my cipher. A message came back to his father, Lord Albemarle,
  to the effect that he hoped Conan Doyle would send some more books. This was
  sent on to me, and of course showed me that it was all right. From that time
  onwards every month or two I pricked off my bulletin, and a long job it was.
  Finally, I learned that the British papers were allowed for the prisoners, so
  that my budget was superfluous. However, for a year or two I think it was
  some solace to them, for I always made it as optimistic as truth would
  allow&mdash;or perhaps a little more so, just to get the average right.</p>

  <p>I had some dealings with General French, but only one interview with him.
  No one can help feeling a deep respect for the soldier who relieved Kimberley
  and headed off Cronje, or for the man who bore the first hard thrust of the
  German spear.</p>

  <p>My only interview with the General was at the Horse Guards, when he talked
  very clearly about the military position, though most of what he said as to
  the changes which modern tactics and heavy guns had caused was rather
  self-evident. "Your problem always is how to pass the wire and the machine
  guns. There is no way round. What is the good of talking of invading Austria
  from the south? You will find the same wire and the same machine guns. We may
  as well face it in Flanders as anywhere else." This talk was shortly after
  Loos, when he had returned from the Army and was at the head of Home Defence.
  "If you want any point looked up for your history, mind you let me know and I
  will see that it is done." This sounded very nice to me, who was in a
  perpetual state of wanting to know; but as a matter of fact I took it as a
  mere empty phrase, and so it proved when a week or two later I put it to the
  test. It was a simple question, but I never got any clear answer.</p>

  <p>One pleasing incident occurred in 1917, when a Hull steam trawler which
  had been named after me, under the able handling of Skipper Addy and
  Lieutenant McCabe of the Naval Reserve, had an action with a heavily armed
  modern submarine, the fight lasting for some hours. The <i>Conan Doyle</i>
  was acting as flagship of a little group of trawlers, and though their guns
  were popguns compared with that of the German, they so peppered him that he
  was either sunk or took flight&mdash;anyhow, he vanished under the water. The
  little boat sent me its ship's bell as a souvenir of the exploit, and I sent
  some small remembrances in exchange. It was a fine exploit, and I was proud
  to be connected with it, even in so remote a way.</p>

  <p>I have in my war chapters expressed my admiration for General Haig. On one
  occasion I called upon Lady Haig, when she was administering some private
  hospital at Farnborough. It was, so far as I could understand, one wing of
  the Empress Eugenie's house, and the Empress invited me to lunch. There were
  present also Prince Victor Napoleon and his wife, who was, I think, a
  daughter of my old aversion, Leopold, King of the Belgians and Overlord of
  the Congo. The Empress interested me deeply&mdash;a historical relic whom one
  would expect to study in old pictures and memoirs, yet there she was moving
  and talking before me. If Helen launched a thousand ships, Eugenie, by all
  accounts, did far more. Indeed, if the first German War was really from her
  inspiration, as Zola insists, she was at the root of all modern history. In
  spite of her great age, her face and figure preserved the lines of elegance
  and breed, the features clearly cut, the head set proudly upon the long neck.
  I glanced into her sitting-room as I passed the open door and noticed that
  she was engaged upon an enormous jig-saw puzzle, a thousand pieces if there
  were one. Children's toys engaged the mind which once played with Empires.
  There is surely something fatal in that Spanish blood with its narrow
  fanatical religion and its masterful intolerance, magnificent but mediaeval
  like the Church which inspires it.</p>

  <p>She talked very freely with me and in the most interesting manner. It was
  surprising to see how fresh her mind was, and what curious information she
  had at her command. She told me, for example, that tetanus in France depended
  very much upon what soil had got into the wound, while that in turn depended
  upon what manures had been used for the soil&mdash;thus the percentage of
  tetanus cases would be quite different in a vine-growing district and in one
  where ordinary crops were cultivated. She spoke seriously about the war, but
  was confident as to the ultimate result. This graceful, withered flower in
  its strange setting was one of the outstanding memories of those days.</p>

  <p>All sorts of queer odd jobs came to me as to many others in the war. I
  was, of course, prepared always to do absolutely anything which was
  suggested, though the suggestions were sometimes not very reasonable. One
  must not argue, but simply put one's whole weight, for what it is worth, into
  the scrum. Once I was directed to go up to Scotland and write up the great
  new munition works at Gretna, as the public needed reassurance upon the
  point. Pearson, the younger brother of Lord Cowdray, had built them, and they
  certainly deserved the name of "Miracle Town," which I gave them in my
  article. The great difficulty always was to give our own people what they
  wanted and yet not to give the Germans that which they wanted also. Winston
  Churchill's remarkable memoirs&mdash;the best, in my opinion, of all the war
  books&mdash;have shown how heavily this pressed in high quarters. His volume
  is certainly a wonderful vindication of his term of office, and it was a loss
  to the country when he left it.</p>

  <p>Churchill was very open to ideas and sympathetic to those who were trying
  for some ideal. I had pondered much over armour for the troops, and he
  commented on it in an inspiring letter, in which he said that the
  bullet-proof man and the torpedo-proof ship were our two great objects. I
  worked a good deal upon the question of shields, and wrote several articles
  about it in "The Times" and other papers, but the forces against us were
  strong. When I saw Mr. Montague on the subject at the Ministry of Munitions,
  he said: "Sir Arthur, there is no use your arguing here, for there is no one
  in the building who does not know that you are right. The whole difficulty
  lies in making the soldiers accept your views."</p>

  <p>One has, of course, to be reasonable on the point, and to admit that there
  is a limit to what a man can carry, and that greater weight means slower
  movement, and therefore longer exposure. That is fully granted. But when the
  helmet in actual practice was found so useful, why should it not be
  supplemented by steel shoulder-guards, since the helmet might actually guide
  the bullets down on to the shoulders? And why not a plastron over the heart?
  The vital points in a man's anatomy are not really so numerous. If many a
  life was saved by a buckle or a cigarette-case, why should such protection
  not be systematized? And why in trench warfare should not strong breastplates
  be kept for the temporary use of any troops in the front line? I experimented
  with my own service rifle upon steel plates, and I was surprised to find how
  easy it was at twenty paces to turn a bullet. I am convinced that very many
  lives would have been saved had my views been adopted, and that the men in
  the hour of danger would have been only too glad to carry that part of their
  equipment.</p>

  <p>The Tank, however, was a device which carried the armour and the men also,
  so that it was an extension of these ideas. We can never be grateful enough
  to the men who thought out the Tank, for I have no doubt at all that this
  product of British brains and British labour won the war, which would
  otherwise have ended in a peace of mutual exhaustion. Churchill, D'Eyncourt,
  Tritton, Swinton and Bertie Stern,&mdash;these were in sober fact, divide the
  credit as you may, the men who played a very essential part in bringing down
  the giant.</p>

  <p>Our household suffered terribly in the war. The first to fall was my
  wife's brother Malcolm Leckie, of the Army Medical Service, whose gallantry
  was so conspicuous that he was awarded a posthumous D.S.O. While he was
  actually dying himself, with shrapnel in his chest, he had the wounded to his
  bedside and bandaged them. Then came the turn of Miss Loder Symonds, who
  lived with us and was a beloved member of the family. Three of her brothers
  were killed and the fourth wounded. Finally, on an evil day for us, she also
  passed on. Then two brave nephews, Alec Forbes and Oscar Hornung, went down
  with bullets through the brain. My gallant brother-in-law, Major Oldham, was
  killed by a sniper during his first days in the trenches. And then finally,
  just as all seemed over, I had a double blow. First it was my Kingsley, my
  only son by the first marriage, one of the grandest boys in body and soul
  that ever a father was blessed with. He had started the war as a private,
  worked up to an acting captaincy in the 1st Hampshires, and been very badly
  wounded on the Somme. It was pneumonia which slew him in London, and the same
  cursed plague carried off my soldier brother Innes, he who had shared my
  humble strivings at Southsea so many years ago. A career lay before him, for
  he was only forty and already Adjutant-General of a corps, with the Legion of
  Honour, and a great record of service. But he was called and he went like the
  hero he was. "You do not complain at all, sir," said the orderly. "I am a
  soldier," said the dying General. Thank God that I have since EXPERIENCES ON
  THE BRITISH FRONT 843 found that the gates are not shut, but only ajar, if
  one does show earnestness in the quest. Of all these that I have mentioned,
  there is but one from whom I have been unable to obtain clear proof of
  posthumous existence.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-28"
     id="ch-28"></a>XXVIII &mdash; EXPERIENCES ON THE BRITISH FRONT</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">Lord Newton&mdash;How I got out&mdash;Sir W.
  Robertson&mdash;The Destroyer&mdash;First Experience of
  Trenches&mdash;Ceremony at Bethune&mdash;Mother&mdash;The Ypres
  Salient&mdash;Ypres&mdash;The Hull Territorial&mdash;General Sir Douglas
  Haig&mdash;Artillery Duel&mdash;Kingsley&mdash;Major
  Wood&mdash;Paris.</p><br>

  <p class="first">I HAD naturally wished to get out to the British front and
  to see things for myself. And yet I had scruples also, for when soldiers are
  doing a difficult job mere spectators and joy-riders are out of place. I felt
  what a perfect nuisance they must be, and hesitated to join them. On the
  other hand, I had surely more claims than most, since I was not only
  compiling a history of the campaign, but was continually writing in the press
  upon military subjects. I made up my mind, therefore, that I was justified in
  going, but I had as yet no opportunity.</p>

  <p>However, it came along in a very strange way. It was in the early summer
  of 1916 that I had a note from Lord Newton, saying that he wished to see me
  at the Foreign Office. I could not conceive what he wanted to see me about,
  but of course I went. Lord Newton seemed to be doing general utility work
  which involved the interests of our prisoners in Germany, as well as press
  arrangements, missions, etc. The former alone would be enough for anyone, and
  he was exposed to severe criticism for not being sufficiently zealous in the
  cause. "Newton, the Teuton," sang the prisoners, a parody on "Gilbert, the
  Filbert," one of the idiotic popular songs of pre-war days. However, I am
  convinced that he really did his very best, and that his policy was wise, for
  if it came to an interchange of revenge and barbarity between Germany and us,
  there was only one in it. There is no use starting a game in which you are
  bound to be beaten. Winston Churchill had tried it in the case of the
  submarine officers, with the result that thirty of our own picked officers
  had endured much in their prisons and the policy had to be reconsidered.</p>

  <p>Lord Newton is a wit and has a humorous face which covers a good deal of
  solid capacity. He plunged instantly into the business on hand.</p>

  <p>"It is the Italian army," said he. "They want a bit of limelight. We
  propose to send several fellows on short missions to write them up. Your name
  has been mentioned and approved. Will you go?"</p>

  <p>I never thought more quickly in my life than on that occasion. I had no
  plan when I entered the room, since I was ignorant of the proposition, but I
  saw my opening in a flash.</p>

  <p>"No," said I.</p>

  <p>Lord Newton looked surprised.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Because I should be in a false position," I answered. "I have nothing to
  compare them with. I have not even seen the British front yet. How absurd it
  would be for me to approve or to condemn when they could reasonably ask me
  what I knew about the matter!"</p>

  <p>"Would you go if that were set right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, certainly."</p>

  <p>"Then I don't think there will be an insuperable difficulty."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you can arrange that, I am entirely at your disposal."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said he, "if you go to the front, and especially to the
  Italian front, a uniform will be essential. What have you a right to
  wear?"</p>

  <p>"I am a private in the Volunteers."</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"I think you would be shot at sight by both armies," said he. "You would
  be looked upon as a rare specimen. I don't think that would do."</p>

  <p>I had a happy thought.</p>

  <p>"I am a deputy-lieutenant of Surrey," said I. "I have the right to wear a
  uniform when with troops."</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" he cried. "Nothing could be better. Well, you will hear from
  me presently."</p>

  <p>I went straight off to my tailor, who rigged me up in a wondrous khaki
  garb which was something between that of a Colonel and a Brigadier, with
  silver roses instead of stars or crowns upon the shoulder-straps. As I had
  the right to wear several medals, including the South African, the general
  effect was all right, but I always felt a mighty impostor, though it was
  certainly very comfortable and convenient. I was still a rare specimen, and
  quite a number of officers of three nations made inquiry about my silver
  roses. A deputy-lieutenant may not be much in England, but when translated
  into French&mdash;my French anyhow&mdash;it has an awe-inspiring effect, and
  I was looked upon by them as an inscrutable but very big person with a
  uniform all of his own.</p>

  <p>It was in May when I had my meeting with Lord Newton, and towards the end
  of the month I received a pass which would take me to the British lines. I
  remember the solicitude of my family, who seemed to think that I was going on
  active service. To quiet their kindly anxieties I said: "My dears, I shall be
  held in the extreme rear, and I shall be lucky if ever I see a shell burst on
  the far horizon." The sequel showed that my estimate was nearly as mistaken
  as theirs.</p>

  <p>I had had some correspondence with General Robertson, and had dedicated my
  History of the war to him, so much was I impressed with the splendid work he
  had done behind the line in the early days, when Cowans and he had as much
  strain and anxiety from their position in the wings as any of those who were
  in the limelight of the stage. He was, as it happened, going over to France,
  and he sent me a note to ask whether I would like to share his private
  compartment on the train and then use his destroyer instead of the ordinary
  steamer. Of course I was delighted. General Robertson is a sturdy, soldierly,
  compact man, with a bull-dog face, and looks as if he might be obstinate and
  even sullen if crossed. Such men are splendid if they keep their qualities
  for the enemy, but possibly dangerous if they use them on their associates.
  Certainly Robertson had a great deal of fighting to do at home as well as
  abroad, and was in the latter days of the war in constant conflict with the
  authorities, and with an open feud against the Prime Minister, but it is hard
  to say who was right. Perhaps, if it were not for the pressure which
  Robertson, Repington and others exercised, it would have been more difficult
  to raise those last few hundred thousand men who saved us in 1918. Like so
  many big men, his appearance was most deceptive, and though he looked every
  inch the soldier, there was nothing to show that great capacity for handling
  a large business, which would surely have put him at the head of any
  commercial concern in the country. There was a Cromwellian touch in him which
  peeped out in occasional religious allusions. He was very engrossed in papers
  and figures, and I hardly had a word with him between London and
  Newhaven.</p>

  <p>We went straight on to the destroyer and she cast off her moorings within
  a few minutes. The Channel crossing was a great experience for me, and I
  stood on the bridge all the time looking about for traces of war&mdash;which
  were not numerous. Just under the bridge stood a sturdy seaman in pea jacket
  and flapped cap, an intent, crouching, formidable figure, with his hand on
  the crank of a quick-firing gun. He never relaxed, and for the whole hour, as
  we tore across, his head, and occasionally his gun, was slowly traversing
  from right to left. The captain, a young lieutenant whose name I have
  forgotten, told me what hellish work it was in the winter, though perhaps
  "hellish" is not the <i>mot juste</i> for that bitterly cold vigil. His ship
  was called the <i>Zulu</i>. Shortly afterwards it was blown up, as was its
  consort the <i>Nubian</i>, but as two of the halves were still serviceable,
  they stuck them together and made one very good ship, the <i>Zubian</i>. You
  can't beat the British dockyard any more than you can the British Navy which
  it mothers. That evening we ran through some twenty miles of Northern France,
  and wound up at the usual guest-house, where I met several travelling
  Russians. Colonel Wilson, a dark, quiet, affable man, who had the thorny job
  of looking after the press, and Brig.-General Charteris, a pleasant, breezy,
  fresh-complexioned soldier, head of the British Intelligence Department,
  joined us at dinner. Everything was quite comfortable, but at the same time
  properly plain and simple. There is nothing more hateful than luxury behind a
  battle-line. Next day I had a wonderful twelve hours in contact with the
  soldiers all the time, and I will take some account of it from the notes I
  made at the time, but now I can expand them and give names more freely.</p>

  <p>The crowning impression which I carried away from that wonderful day was
  the enormous imperturbable confidence of the Army and its extraordinary
  efficiency in organization, administration, material, and personnel. I met in
  one day a sample of many types, an army commander, a corps commander, two
  divisional commanders, staff officers of many grades, and, above all, I met
  repeatedly the two very great men whom Britain has produced, the private
  soldier and the regimental officer. Everywhere and on every face one read the
  same spirit of cheerful bravery. Even the half-mad cranks whose absurd
  consciences prevented them from barring the way to the devil seemed to me to
  be turning into men under the prevailing influence. I saw a batch of them,
  neurotic and largely bespectacled, but working with a will by the roadside.
  There was no foolish bravado, no underrating of a dour opponent, but a quick,
  alert, confident attention to the job in hand which was an inspiration to the
  observer.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the car. Don't let it stay here. It may be hit." These words
  from a staff officer gave you the first idea that things were going to
  happen. Up to then you might have been driving through the black country in
  the Walsall district with the population of Aldershot let loose upon its
  dingy roads. "Put on this shrapnel helmet. That hat of yours would infuriate
  the Boche"&mdash;this was an unkind allusion to my uniform. "Take this gas
  mask. You won't need it, but it is a standing order. Now come on!"</p>

  <p>We crossed a meadow and entered a trench. Here and there it came to the
  surface again where there was dead ground. At one such point an old church
  stood, with an unexploded shell sticking out of the wall. A century hence
  folk may journey to see that shell. Then on again through an endless cutting.
  It was slippery clay below. I had no nails in my boots, an iron pot on my
  head, and the sun above me. I remember that walk. The telephone wires ran
  down the side. Here and there large thistles and other plants grew from the
  clay walls, so immobile had been our lines. Occasionally there were patches
  of untidiness. "Shells," said the officer laconically. There was a racket of
  guns before us and behind, especially behind, but danger seemed remote with
  all these Bairnsfather groups of cheerful Tommies at work around us. I passed
  one group of grimy, tattered boys. A glance at their shoulders showed me that
  they were of a public-school battalion, the 20th Royal Fusiliers. "I thought
  you fellows were all officers now," I remarked. "No, sir, we like it better
  so." "Well, it will be a great memory for you. We are all in your debt."</p>

  <p>They saluted, and we squeezed past them. They had the fresh brown faces of
  boy cricketers. But their comrades were men of a different type, with hard,
  strong, rugged features, and the eyes of men who have seen strange sights.
  These were veterans, men of Mons, and their young pals of the public schools
  had something to live up to.</p>

  <p>Up to this we only had two clay walls to look at. But now our interminable
  and tropical walk was lightened by the sight of a British aeroplane sailing
  overhead. Numerous shrapnel bursts were all around it, but she floated on
  serenely, a thing of delicate beauty against the blue background. Now another
  passed&mdash;and yet another. All the morning we saw them circling and
  swooping, and never a sign of a Boche. They told me it was nearly always
  so&mdash;that we held the air, and that the Boche intruder, save at early
  morning, was a rare bird. "We have never met a British aeroplane which was
  not ready to fight," said a captured German aviator. There was a fine, stern
  courtesy between the airmen on either side, each dropping notes into the
  other's aerodromes to tell the fate of missing officers. Had the whole war
  been fought by the Germans as their airmen conducted it (I do not speak, of
  course, of the Zeppelin murderers), a peace would eventually have been more
  easily arranged.</p>

  <p>And now we were there&mdash;in what was surely the most wonderful spot in
  the world&mdash;the front firing trench, the outer breakwater which held back
  the German tide. How strange that this monstrous oscillation of giant forces,
  setting in from east to west, should find their equilibrium across this
  particular meadow of Flanders. "How far?" I asked. "One hundred and eighty
  yards," said my guide. "Pop!" remarked a third person just in front. "A
  sniper," said my guide; "take a look through the periscope." I did so. There
  was some rusty wire before me, then a field sloping slightly upwards with
  knee-deep grass, and ragged dock and fennel and nettles, then rusty wire
  again, and a red line of broken earth. There was not a sign of movement, but
  sharp eyes were always watching us, even as these crouching soldiers around
  me were watching them. There were dead Germans in the grass before us. You
  need not see them to know that they were there. A wounded soldier sat in a
  corner nursing his leg. Here and there men popped out like rabbits from
  dug-outs and mine-shafts. Others sat on the fire-step or leaned smoking
  against the clay wall. Who would dream, who looked at their bold, careless
  faces, that this was a front line, and that at any moment it was possible
  that a grey wave might submerge them? With all their careless bearing, I
  noticed that every man had his gas mask and his rifle within easy reach.</p>

  <p>A mile of front trenches and then we were on our way back down that weary
  walk. Then I was whisked off upon a ten-mile drive. There was a pause for
  lunch at Corps Head-quarters, and after it we were taken to a medal
  presentation in the market square of Bethune. Generals Munro, Haking, and
  Landon, famous fighting soldiers all three, were the British representatives.
  Munro, with a ruddy face, all brain above, all bulldog below; Haking, pale,
  distinguished, intellectual; Landon, a pleasant genial country squire. An
  elderly French General stood beside them. British infantry kept the ground.
  In front were about fifty Frenchmen in civil dress of every grade of life,
  workmen and gentlemen, in a double rank. They were all so wounded that they
  were back in civil life, but today they were to have some solace for their
  wounds. They leaned heavily on sticks, their bodies twisted and maimed, but
  their faces were shining with pride and joy. The French General drew his
  sword and addressed them. One caught words like "honneur" and "patrie." They
  leaned forward on their crutches, hanging on every syllable which came
  hissing and rasping from under that heavy white moustache. Then the medals
  were pinned on. One poor lad was terribly wounded and needed two sticks. A
  little girl ran out with some flowers. He leaned forward and tried to kiss
  her, but the crutches slipped and he nearly fell upon her. It was a pitiful
  but beautiful little scene.</p>

  <p>Next the British candidates marched up one by one for their medals, hale,
  hearty men, brown and fit. There was a smart young officer of Scottish
  Rifles; and then a selection of Worcesters, Welsh Fusiliers and Scots
  Fusiliers, with one funny little Highlander, a tiny figure with a soup-bowl
  helmet, a grinning boy's face beneath it, and a bedraggled uniform. "Many
  acts of great bravery"&mdash;such was the record for which he was decorated.
  Even the French wounded smiled at his quaint appearance, as they did at
  another Briton who had acquired the chewing-gum habit, and came up for his
  medal as if he had been called suddenly in the middle of his dinner, which he
  was still endeavouring to bolt. Then came the end, with the National Anthem.
  The British battalion formed fours and went past. To me that was the most
  impressive sight of any. They were the Queen's West Surreys, a veteran
  battalion of the great Ypres battle. What grand fellows! As the order came,
  "Eyes right," and all those fierce, dark faces flashed round at us I felt the
  might of the British infantry, the intense individuality which is not
  incompatible with the highest discipline. Much they had endured, but a great
  spirit shone from their faces. I confess that as I looked at those brave
  English lads, and thought of what we owed to them and to their like who have
  passed on, I felt more emotional than befits a Briton in foreign parts. How
  many of them are left alive to-day!</p>

  <p>Now the ceremony was ended, and once again we set out for the front. It
  was to an artillery observation post just opposite the Loos Salient that we
  were bound. In an hour I found myself, together with a razor-keen young
  artillery observer and an excellent old sportsman of a Russian prince, jammed
  into a very small space, and staring through a slit at the German lines. In
  front of us lay a vast plain, scarred and slashed, with bare places at
  intervals, such as you see where gravel pits break a green common. Not a sign
  of life or movement, save some wheeling crows. And yet down there, within a
  mile or so, was the population of a city. Far away a single train was puffing
  at the back of the German lines. We were here on a definite errand. Away to
  the right, nearly three miles off, was a small red house, dim to the eye but
  clear in the glasses, suspected as a German post. It was to go up this
  afternoon. The gun was some distance away, but I heard the telephone
  directions. "Mother' will soon do her in," remarked the gunner boy
  cheerfully. "Mother" was the name of the gun. "Give her five six three four,"
  he cried through the 'phone. "Mother" uttered a horrible bellow from
  somewhere on our right. An enormous spout of smoke rose ten seconds later
  from near the house. "A little short," said our gunner. "Two and a half
  minutes left," added a little small voice, which represented another observer
  at a different angle. "Raise her seven five," said our boy encouragingly.
  "Mother" roared more angrily than ever. "How will that do?" she seemed to
  say. "One and a half right," said our invisible gossip. I wondered how the
  folk in the house were feeling as the shells crept ever nearer. "Gun laid,
  sir," said the telephone. "Fire!" I was looking through my glass. A flash of
  fire on the house, a huge pillar of dust and smoke&mdash;then it settled, and
  an unbroken field was there. The German post had gone up. "It's a dear little
  gun," said the officer boy.</p>

  <p>"And her shells are reliable," remarked a senior behind us. "They vary
  with different calibres, but 'Mother' never goes wrong." The German line was
  very quiet. "Pourquoi ne repondent-ils pas?" asked the Russian prince. "Yes,
  they are quiet to-day," answered the senior. "But we get it in the neck
  sometimes." We were all led off to be introduced to "Mother," who sat, squat
  and black, amid twenty of her grimy children who waited upon her and fed her.
  A dainty eater was "Mother," and nothing served her but the best and plenty
  of it. But she was an important and as the war progressed it became more and
  more evident that in spite of that upstart family of quick-firers it was
  really the only big, heavy, well-established gun which could flatten out a
  road to the Rhine.</p>

  <p>I had the great joy that night of seeing my brother Innes, who had been
  promoted to Colonel, and was acting as Assistant Adjutant-General of the 24th
  Division, the Head-quarters of which were at Bailleul, where I dined at mess
  and occupied a small lodging in the town, which was about six miles from the
  front. One more experience wound up that wonderful day. That night we took a
  car after dark and drove north, and ever north, until at a late hour we
  halted and climbed a hill in the darkness. Below was a wonderful sight. Down
  on the flats, in a huge semicircle, lights were rising and falling. They were
  very brilliant, going up for a few seconds and then dying down. Sometimes a
  dozen were in the air at one time. There were the dull thuds of explosions
  and an occasional rattat-tat. I have seen nothing like it, but the nearest
  comparison would be an enormous ten-mile railway station in full swing at
  night, with signals winking, lamps waving, engines hissing and carriages
  bumping. It was a terrible place, a place which will live as long as military
  history is written, for it was the Ypres Salient. What a salient too! A huge
  curve, as outlined by the lights, needing only a little more to be an
  encirclement. Something caught the rope as it closed, and that something was
  the British soldier. But it was a perilous place by day and by night. Never
  shall I forget the impression of ceaseless, malignant activity which was
  borne in upon me by the white, winking lights, the red sudden flares, and the
  horrible thudding noises in that place of death beneath me.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>In old days we had a great name as organizers. Then came a long period
  when we deliberately adopted a policy of individuality and "go as you
  please." Now once again in our sore need we had called on all our power of
  administration and direction. And it had not deserted us. We still had it in
  a supreme degree. Even in peace time we have shown it in that vast,
  well-oiled, swift-running noiseless machine called the British Navy. But our
  powers had risen with the need of them. The expansion of the Navy was a
  miracle, the management of the transport a greater one, the formation of the
  new Army the greatest of all time. To get the men was the least of the
  difficulties. To put them in the field, with everything down to the lid of
  the last field saucepan in its place, that was the marvel. The tools of the
  gunners and of the sappers, to say nothing of the knowledge of how to use
  them, were in themselves a huge problem. But it had all been met and
  mastered. So don't let us talk too much about the muddling of the War Office.
  It has become just a little ridiculous.</p>

  <p>I was the guest at Head-quarters of a divisional General, Capper, brother
  of the heroic leader of the 7th Division, who might truly be called one of
  the two fathers of the British flying force, for it was he, with Templer, who
  laid the first foundations from which so great an organization has arisen. My
  morning was spent in visiting two fighting brigadiers, Mitford and Jelf,
  cheery weather-beaten soldiers, respectful, as all our soldiers are, of the
  prowess of the Hun, but serenely confident that we could beat him. In company
  with one of them I ascended a hill, the reverse slope of which was swarming
  with cheerful infantry in every stage of <i>déshabille</i>, for they were
  cleaning up after the trenches. Once over the slope we advanced with some
  care, and finally reached a certain spot from which we looked down upon the
  German line. It was an observation post, about 1,000 yards from the German
  trenches, with our own trenches between us. We could see the two lines,
  sometimes only a few yards, as it seemed, apart, extending for miles on
  either side. The sinister silence and solitude were strangely dramatic. Such
  vast crowds of men, such intensity of feeling, and yet only that open rolling
  country-side, with never a movement in its whole expanse.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon my brother drove me to the Square at Ypres. It was the
  city of a dream, this modern Pompeii, destroyed, deserted and desecrated, but
  with a sad, proud dignity which made you involuntarily lower your voice as
  you passed through the ruined streets. It was a more considerable place than
  I had imagined, with many traces of ancient grandeur. No words can describe
  the absolute splintered wreck that the Huns had made of it. The effect of
  some of the shells had been grotesque. One boiler-plated water tower, a thing
  40 or 50 feet high, was actually standing on its head like a great metal top.
  There was not a living soul in the place save a few pickets of soldiers, and
  a number of cats which had become fierce and dangerous. Now and then a shell
  still fell, but the Huns probably knew that the devastation was already
  complete.</p>

  <p>We stood in the lonely grass-grown Square, once the busy centre of the
  town, and we marvelled at the beauty of the smashed cathedral and the
  tottering Cloth Hall beside it. Surely at their best they could not have
  looked more wonderful. If they were preserved even so, and if a
  heaven-inspired artist were to model a statue of Belgium in front, Belgium
  with one hand pointing to the treaty by which Prussia guaranteed her safety
  and the other to the sacrilege behind her, it would make the most impressive
  group in the world. It was an evil day for Belgium when her frontier was
  violated, but it was a worse one for Germany. I venture to prophesy that it
  will be regarded by history as the greatest military as well as political
  error that has ever been made. Had the great guns that destroyed Liège made
  their first breach at Verdun, what chance was there for Paris? Those few
  weeks of warning and preparation saved France, and left Germany like a weary
  and furious bull, tethered fast in the place of trespass and waiting for the
  inevitable pole-axe.</p>

  <p>We were glad to get out of the place, for the gloom of it lay as heavy
  upon our hearts as the shrapnel helmets did upon our heads. Both were
  lightened as we sped back past empty and shattered villas to where, just
  behind the danger line, the normal life of rural Flanders was carrying on as
  usual. A merry sight helped to cheer us, for scudding down wind above our
  heads came a Boche aeroplane, with two British at her tail barking away with
  their machine guns, like two swift terriers after a cat. They shot
  rat-tattatting across the sky until we lost sight of them in the heat haze
  over the German line.</p>

  <p>The afternoon saw us on the Sharpenburg, from which many a million will
  gaze in days to come, for from no other point can so much be seen. It was a
  spot forbid, but a special permit took us up, and the sentry on duty, having
  satisfied himself of our bona-fides, proceeded to tell us tales of the war in
  a pure Hull dialect which might have been Chinese for all that I could
  understand. That he was a "Terrier" and had nine children were the only facts
  I could lay hold of. But I wished to be silent and to think&mdash;even,
  perhaps, to pray. Here, just below my feet, were the spots which our dear
  lads, three of them my own kith, had sanctified with their blood. Here,
  fighting for the freedom of the world, they cheerily gave their all. On that
  sloping meadow to the left of the row of houses on the opposite ridge the
  London Scottish fought to the death on that grim November morning when the
  Bavarians reeled back from their shot-torn line. That plain away on the other
  side of Ypres was the place where the three grand Canadian brigades, first of
  all men, stood up to the damnable gases of the Hun. Down yonder was Hill 60,
  that blood-soaked kopje.</p>

  <p>The ridge over the fields was held by the cavalry against two army corps,
  and there where the sun struck the red roof among the trees I could just see
  Gheluvelt, a name for ever to be associated with Haig and the most vital
  battle of the war. As I turned away I was faced by my Hull Territorial, who
  still said incomprehensible things. I looked at him with other eyes. He had
  fought on yonder plain. He had slain Huns, and he had nine children. Could
  any one better epitomize the duties of a good citizen in days like these? I
  could have found it in my heart to salute him had I not known that it would
  have shocked him and made him unhappy.</p>

  <p>Next day, it was June 1, I left my brother's kindly care. I had fears for
  him, for he was much overworked and worried as Adjutant-Generals of busy
  divisions are likely to be. However, he was never one to admit it or to pity
  himself, and he begged me to carry the cheeriest report back to his wife. It
  was a great pleasure to me that so many officers took me aside to say how
  efficient he was, and how popular. He would not have wished me to say it were
  he alive, but I can leave it on record now.</p>

  <p>Yesterday had been full, but the next day was not less so, for I had been
  asked (or ordered) to lunch at the General Head-quarters at Montreuil, the
  funny old town on a hill which I had learned to know well in days of peace.
  As we drove down a winding drive I saw two officers walking towards us. The
  younger of them stooped and beat the ground with his stick, from which we
  gathered that we were to go slow and raise no dust. We rightly conjectured
  that so curt an order could only come from the Chief's own aide. We saluted
  as we passed and carried away an impression of a heavy moustache and of
  abstracted blue eyes.</p>

  <p>I had a very much more definite impression when he came back presently,
  and we were all shown into the dining-room. I should certainly put Douglas
  Haig, as I saw him that day, among the handsomest men I have ever known. He
  was not tall, but he was upright and well proportioned with every sign of
  EXPERIENCES ON THE BRITISH FRONT 357 strength and activity. But his face was
  remarkable for beauty and power. His eyes were very full and expressive,
  devoid of the fierceness of Kitchener and yet with quite as much
  determination. But the long powerful jaw was the feature which spoke
  particularly of that never-to-be-beaten quality which saved the army when the
  line was broken in the first Ypres battle and was destined to save it again
  in April, 1918, when he gave out his "back to the wall" order of the day. He
  was courteous but not talkative at lunch. After lunch he took me into a side
  room where he showed me the line of the divisions on the map, saying that I
  could remember but should not take notes, which was rather maddening. Then we
  had a long talk over the coffee, but there were several present and nothing
  intimate was said. He must be worried to death with casual visitors, but
  still I suppose he need not invite all of them to Head-quarters. He had, I
  thought, a truly British distrust of foreigners. "He is the worst foreigner I
  have met yet," he said, speaking of some Italian General. His kind heart was
  shown when I said that my son was in the line. He gave a curt order, and then
  nodded and smiled. "You'll see him to-morrow," said he.</p>

  <p>I naturally heard a good deal about our Generalissimo, besides what I
  actually saw. I think that he had some of the traits of Wellington, though
  since the war he has concerned himself with the fortunes of his
  comrades-in-arms a great deal more than the Iron Duke seems ever to have
  troubled himself to do. But in other things the parallel is close. Haig is
  not a game-playing man, though fond of horse exercise. Neither was the Duke.
  Both were abstemious with wine and tobacco. Both were reserved, reticent and
  had no magnetic connection with those under them. Neither Haig nor the Duke
  were human figures to the soldiers, nor were they often if ever seen by them,
  and yet in each case there was the same confidence in their judgment. Haig
  was a very serious man, he seldom joked and did not meet a joke half way, so
  that his mess was the dullest in France. I have known a staff officer apply
  for an exchange so weary was he of this oppressive atmosphere. All this could
  equally have been said of the Duke. But these are trivialities compared to
  the great main fact that each brought rare qualities to the service of their
  country at critical moments of the world's history. There was only one other
  man who might have filled Haig's place, and that man was the conqueror of
  Palestine.</p>

  <p>Extraordinary are the contrasts of war. Within three hours of leaving the
  quiet atmosphere of the Head-quarters Château I was present at what in any
  other war would have been looked upon as a brisk engagement. As it was it
  would certainly figure in one of our desiccated reports as an activity of the
  artillery. The noise as we struck the line at this new point showed that the
  matter was serious, and indeed we had chosen the spot because it had been the
  storm centre of the last week. The method of approach chosen by our
  experienced guide was in itself a tribute to the gravity of the affair. As
  one comes from the settled order of Flanders into the actual scene of war,
  the first sign of it is one of the stationary, sausage-shaped balloons, a
  chain of which marks the ring in which the great wrestlers are locked. We
  passed under this, ascended a hill, and found ourselves in a garden where for
  a year no feet save those of wanderers like ourselves had stood. There was a
  wild, confused luxuriance of growth more beautiful to my eye than anything
  which the care of man can produce. One old shell-hole of vast diameter had
  filled itself with forget-me-nots, and appeared as a graceful basin of light
  blue flowers, held up as an atonement to Heaven for the brutalities of man.
  Through the tangled bushes we crept, then across a yard&mdash;"Please stoop
  and run as you pass this point"&mdash;and finally to a small opening in a
  wall, whence the battle lay not so much before as beside us. For a moment we
  had a front seat at the great world-drama, God's own problem play, working
  surely to its magnificent end. One felt a sort of shame to crouch here in
  comfort, a useless spectator, while brave men down yonder were facing that
  pelting shower of iron.</p>

  <p>There was a large field on our left rear, and the German gunners had the
  idea that there was a concealed battery therein. They were systematically
  searching for it. A great shell exploded in the top corner, but got nothing
  more solid than a few tons of clay. You could read the mind of Gunner Fritz.
  "Try the lower corner!" said he, and up went the earth-cloud once again.
  "Perhaps it's hid about the middle. I'll try." Earth again, and nothing more.
  "I believe I was right the first time after all," said hopeful Fritz. So
  another shell came into the top corner. The field was full of pits as a
  Gruyère cheese, but Fritz got nothing by his perseverance. Perhaps there
  never was a battery there at all. One effect he obviously did attain. He made
  several other British batteries exceedingly angry. "Stop that tickling,
  Fritz!" was the burden of their cry. Where they were we could no more see
  than Fritz could, but their constant work was very clear along the German
  line. We appeared to be using more shrapnel and the Germans more high
  explosives, but that may have been just the chance of the day. The Vimy Ridge
  was on our right, and before us was the old French position, with the
  Labyrinth of terrible memories and the long hill of Lorette. When, the year
  before last, the French, in a three weeks' battle, fought their way up that
  hill, it was an exhibition of sustained courage which even their military
  annals can seldom have beaten.</p>

  <p>Next day we travelled through Acheux and hit the British line once more to
  the east of that place. Our official chauffeur had had his instructions, and
  so had other people, with the result that as we swung into the broad main
  street of a village&mdash;Mailly, I think, was the name&mdash;there was a
  tall young officer standing with his back turned. He swung round at the noise
  of the car, and it was my boy Kingsley with his usual jolly grin upon his
  weather-stained features. The long arm of G.H.Q. had stretched out and
  plucked him out of a trench, and there he was. We had an hour's talk in a
  field, for there was nowhere else to go. He was hard and well and told me
  that all was nearly ready for a big push at the very part of the line where
  his battalion, the 1st Hampshires, was stationed. This was the first
  intimation of the great Somme battle, on the first day of which every officer
  of the Hampshires without exception was killed or wounded. I learned
  afterwards that before the battle for ten nights running Kingsley crept out
  to the German wire and stuck up crosses where he found the wire uncut, which
  were brown towards the enemy and white towards the British, as a guide to the
  gunners. He lay on his face sometimes with the machine guns firing just above
  him. For this service Colonel Palk thanked him warmly and said he should
  certainly have a decoration, but Palk and both majors were killed and no
  recommendations went forward. Two shrapnel bullets in the neck were all
  Kingsley got out of the battle, and two months on his back in a hospital.
  However, he was not a medal hunter and I never heard him complain, nor would
  he wear his wound badges until he was compelled.</p>

  <p>An hour later I met another member of my household, for my Secretary,
  Major Wood of the 5th Sussex Territorials, was Town Major of Beauquesne,
  where I found him at the convenient hour of lunch. He had done nearly two
  years of hard active service, which was pretty good for a civilian of fifty;
  and had led his company at Festubert and other engagements. He was now using
  his excellent powers of organization and administration in making Beauquesne
  a well-ordered village, as later he made Doullens a well-ordered town. I
  expect that the British administration will remain as a wonderful legend of
  sanitation and cleanliness in many of these French towns of the
  North-East.</p>

  <p>After inspecting Major Wood's work I went on to Amiens with him and he
  packed me into the train to Paris, the first part of my task thoroughly done
  so far as time would permit. I came away with a deep sense of the difficult
  task which lay before the Army, but with an equally deep one of the ability
  of those men to do all that soldiers can be called upon to perform. But I saw
  no end to the war.</p>

  <p>I had two days in Paris&mdash;.a very dead and alive Paris, such a Paris
  as has seldom or never been seen before, with darkened streets and the shops
  nearly all closed. I stayed at the Hotel Crillon, where were a few Russian
  and British officers. It was extraordinary the difference which the public
  made between the two. A British officer was disregarded, while a Russian
  General&mdash;I took a walk with one&mdash;was looked upon with an adulation
  which was quite comic. Men came up and made a low obeisance before him. And
  yet it was our Army, our purse, our factories, above all our Navy, which were
  saving the situation both for France and Russia, to whom we were bound by no
  alliance. There was certainly not much sign of appreciation or gratitude. It
  is a very singular thing how the whole world alternately leans upon and
  depreciates the British Empire.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-29"
     id="ch-29"></a>XXIX &mdash; EXPERIENCES ON THE ITALIAN FRONT</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">The Polite Front&mdash;Udine&mdash;Under
  Fire&mdash;Carnic Alps&mdash;Italia Irredenta&mdash;Trentino&mdash;The Voice
  of the Holy Roman Empire.</p><br>

  <p class="first">TWO days later I found myself, after an uneventful journey,
  at Padua on my way to the Italian front. The Italian front seemed to have
  politely come back to meet me, for I was awakened in the night by a
  tremendous dropping of bombs, with the rattle of anti-aircraft guns. I
  thought I was as safe in bed as anywhere, and so it proved. Little damage was
  done, but Padua and the other Italian cities were having a bad time, and it
  was a one-sided arrangement, since the Italians can do nothing without
  injuring their own kith and kin across the border. This dropping of
  explosives on the chance of hitting one soldier among fifty victims was
  surely the most monstrous development of the whole war, and was altogether
  German in its origin. If international law cannot now stamp it out, the next
  war will send the people flying to the caves and calling upon the mountains
  to cover them, even as was foretold.</p>

  <p>I arrived at last at Udine, the capital of the Friulian Province, where
  were the Italian Head-quarters&mdash;a funny little town with a huge mound in
  the centre, which looked too big to be artificial, but was said to have been
  thrown up by Attila. My recommendation was to the British Mission, which was
  headed by Brig.-General Delme-Radcliffe, who received me with hospitality, a
  bluff, short-spoken and masterful British soldier. The Mission owned a white
  house on the edge of the town. On the second floor under a window which
  proved to be that of my bedroom there was a long dark smear upon the
  whitewashed wall. "That's the stomach of a baker," said the soldier-servant
  with a grin. I thought it was a joke on his part, but it was literally true,
  for a bomb a few days before had blown the man to bits as he passed the
  house, and had plastered bits of him on the stonework. The ceiling of my
  bedroom was full of holes from that or some other explosion.</p>

  <p>There was some tendency at this time to cavil at the Italians and to
  wonder why they did not make more impression upon the Austrians. As a matter
  of fact they were faced by the same barbed wire and machine-gun problem which
  had held up every one else. I soon saw, when I was allowed next morning to
  get to the front, that the conditions were very like those of Flanders in a
  more genial climate and in all ways less aggravated. I had been handed over
  to the Italian Intelligence people, who were represented by a charmingly
  affable nobleman, Colonel the Marquis Barbariche, and Colonel Claricetti.
  These two introduced me at once to General Porro, chief of the Staff, a
  brown, wrinkled, walnut-faced warrior, who showed me some plans and did what
  he could to be helpful.</p>

  <p>It was about a seven miles drive from Udine before we reached the nearest
  point of the trenches. From a mound an extraordinary view could be got of the
  Austrian position, the general curve of both lines being marked, as in
  Flanders, by the sausage balloons which float behind them. The Isonzo, which
  had been so bravely carried by the Italians, lay in front of me, a clear blue
  river, as broad as the Thames at Hampton Court. In a hollow to my left were
  the roofs of Gorizia, the town which the Italians were endeavouring to take.
  A long desolate ridge, the Carso, extended to the south of the town, and
  stretched down nearly to the sea. The crest was held by the Austrians, and
  the Italian trenches had been pushed within 50 yards of them. A lively
  bombardment was going on from either side, but so far as the infantry went
  there was none of that constant malignant petty warfare with which we were
  familiar in Flanders. I was anxious to see the Italian trenches, in order to
  compare them with our British methods, but save for the support and
  communication trenches I was courteously but firmly warned off.</p>

  <p>Having got this general view of the position, I was anxious in the
  afternoon to visit Monfalcone, which is the small dockyard captured from the
  Austrians on the Adriatic. My kind Italian officer guides did not recommend
  the trip, as it was part of their great hospitality to shield their guest
  from any part of that danger which they were always ready to incur
  themselves. The only road to Monfalcone ran close to the Austrian position at
  the village of Ronchi, and afterwards kept parallel to it for some miles. I
  was told that it was only on odd days that the Austrian guns were active in
  this particular section, so determined to trust to luck that this might not
  be one of them. It proved, however, to be one of the worst on record, and we
  were not destined to see the dockyard to which we started.</p>

  <p>The civilian cuts a ridiculous figure when he enlarges upon small
  adventures which may come his way&mdash;adventures which the soldier endures
  in silence as part of his everyday life. On this occasion, however, the
  episode was all our own, and had a sporting flavour in it which made it
  dramatic. I know now the feeling of tense expectation with which the driven
  grouse whirrs onwards towards the butt. I have been behind the butt before
  now, and it is only poetic justice that I should see the matter from the
  other point of view. As we approached Ronchi we could see shrapnel breaking
  over the road in front of us, but we had not yet realized that it was
  precisely for vehicles that the Austrians were waiting, and that they had the
  range marked down to a yard. We went down the road all out at a steady 50
  miles an hour. The village was near, and it seemed that we had got past the
  place of danger. We had, in fact, just reached it. At this moment there was a
  noise as if the whole four tyres had gone simultaneously, a most terrific
  bang in our very ears, merging into a second sound like a reverberating blow
  upon an enormous gong. As I glanced up I saw three clouds immediately above
  my head, two of them white and the other of a rusty red. The air was full of
  flying metal, and the road, as we were told afterwards by an observer, was
  all churned up by it. The metal base of one of the shells was found plumb in
  the middle of the road just where our motor had been. It was our pace that
  saved us. The motor was an open one, and the three shells burst, according to
  one of my Italian companions, who was himself an artillery officer, about 10
  metres above our heads. They threw forward, however, and we travelling at so
  great a pace, shot from under. Before they could get in another we had swung
  round the curve and under the lee of a house. The good Colonel wrung my hand
  in silence. They were both distressed, these good soldiers, under the
  impression that they had led me into danger. As a matter of fact it was I who
  owed them an apology, since they had enough risks in the way of business
  without taking others in order to gratify the whim of a visitor.</p>

  <p>Our difficulties were by no means over. We found an ambulance lorry and a
  little group of infantry huddled under the same shelter, with the expression
  of people who had been caught in the rain. The road beyond was under heavy
  fire as well as that by which we had come. Had the Ostro-Boches dropped a
  high explosive upon us they would have had a good mixed bag. But apparently
  they were only out for fancy shooting and disdained a sitter. Presently there
  came a lull and the lorry moved on, but we soon heard a burst of firing which
  showed that they were after it. My companions had decided that it was out of
  the question for us to finish our excursion. We waited for some time,
  therefore, and were able finally to make our retreat on foot, being joined
  later by the car. So ended my visit to Monfalcone, the place I did not reach.
  I hear that two 10,000-ton steamers were left on the stocks there by the
  Austrians, but were disabled before they retired. Their cabin basins and
  other fittings were adorning the Italian dug-outs.</p>

  <p>My second day was devoted to a view of the Italian mountain warfare in the
  Carnic Alps. Besides the two great fronts, one of defence (Trentino) and one
  of offence (Isonzo), there were very many smaller valleys which had to be
  guarded. The total frontier line is over 400 miles, and it had all to be held
  against raids if not invasions. It was a most picturesque business. Far up in
  the Roccolana Valley I found the Alpini outposts, backed by artillery which
  had been brought into the most wonderful positions. They had taken 8-inch
  guns where a tourist could hardly take his knapsack. Neither side could ever
  make serious progress, but there were continual duels, gun against gun, or
  Alpini against Jaeger. In a little wayside house was the brigade
  Head-quarters, and here I was entertained to lunch. It was a scene that I
  shall remember. They drank to England. I raised my glass to <i>Italia
  irredenta</i>&mdash;might it soon be redenta. They all sprang to their feet
  and the circle of dark faces flashed into flame. They keep their souls and
  emotions, these people. I trust that ours may not become atrophied by
  self-suppression.</p>

  <p>The last day spent on the Italian front was in the Trentino. From Verona a
  motor drive of about twenty-five miles takes one up the valley of the Adige,
  and past a place of evil augury for the Austrians, the field of Rivoli.
  Finally, after a long drive of winding gradients, always beside the Adige, we
  reached Ala, where we interviewed the Commander of the sector, a man who has
  done splendid work during the recent fighting. "By all means you can see my
  front. But no motor car, please. It draws fire, and others may be hit besides
  you." We proceeded on foot, therefore, along a valley which branched at the
  end into two passes. In both very active fighting had been going on, and as
  we came up the guns were baying merrily, waking up most extraordinary echoes
  in the hills. It was difficult to believe that it was not thunder. There was
  one terrible voice that broke out from time to time in the
  mountains&mdash;the angry voice of the Holy Roman Empire. When it came all
  other sounds died down into nothing. It was&mdash;so I was told&mdash;the
  master gun, the vast 42-centimetre giant which brought down the pride of
  Liège and Namur. The Austrians had brought one or more from Innsbruck. The
  Italians assure me, however, as we have ourselves discovered, that in trench
  work beyond a certain point the size of the guns makes little matter.</p>

  <p>We passed a burst dug-out by the roadside where a tragedy had occurred
  recently, for eight medical officers were killed in it by a single shell.
  There was no particular danger in the valley, however, and the aimed fire was
  all going across us to the fighting lines in the two passes above us. That to
  the right, the Valley of Buello, has seen some of the worst of the fighting.
  These two passes form the Italian left wing which has held firm all through.
  So has the right wing. It is only the centre which has been pushed in by the
  concentrated fire.</p>

  <p>When we arrived at the spot where the two valleys forked we were halted,
  and were not permitted to advance to the front trenches which lay upon the
  crests above us. There were about 1,000 yards between the adversaries. I have
  seen types of some of the Bosnian and Croatian prisoners, men of poor
  physique and intelligence, but the Italians speak with chivalrous praise of
  the bravery of the Hungarians and of the Austrian Jaeger. Some of their
  proceedings disgusted them, however, and especially the fact that they used
  Russian prisoners to dig trenches under fire. There is no doubt of this, as
  some of the men were recaptured and were sent on to join their comrades in
  France. On the whole, however, it may be said that in the Austro-Italian war
  there was nothing which corresponded with the extreme bitterness of our
  Western conflict. The presence or absence of the Hun makes all the
  difference.</p>

  <p>It was a moment of depression at the Trentino front, as there had been a
  set back. I may flatter myself when I think that even one solitary figure in
  a British uniform striding about among them was good at that particular time
  to their eyes. They read of allies, but they never saw any. If they had, we
  might have been spared the subsequent disaster at Caporetto. Certainly I was
  heartily welcomed there, and surrounded all the time by great mobs of
  soldiers, who imagined, I suppose, that I was some one of importance.</p>

  <p>That night found me back at Verona, and next morning I was on my way to
  Paris with sheaves of notes about the Italian soldiers which would, I hoped,
  make the British public more sympathetic towards them. I was told afterwards
  by the Foreign Office that my mission had been an unmixed success.</p>

  <p>I have one other association with the Italian front which I may include
  here. It is embalmed in the Annals of the Psychic Research Society. I have
  several times in my life awakened from sleep with some strong impressions of
  knowledge gained still lingering in my brain. In one case, for example, I got
  the strange name <i>Naldera</i> so vividly that I wrote it down between two
  stretches of insensibility and found it on the outside of my cheque book next
  morning. A month later I started for Australia in the s.s. <i>Naldera</i> of
  which I had then never heard. In this particular Italian instance I got the
  word Piave, absolutely ringing in my head. I knew it as a river some 70 miles
  to the rear of the Italian front and quite unconnected with the war. None the
  less the impression was so strong that I wrote the incident down and had it
  signed by two witnesses. Months passed and the Italian battle line was rolled
  back to the Piave, which became a familiar word. Some said it would go back
  further. I was sure it would not. I argued that if the abnormal forces,
  whatever they may be, had taken such pains to impress the matter upon me, it
  must needs be good news which they were conveying, since I had needed
  cheering at the time. Therefore I felt sure that some great victory and the
  turning point of the war would come on the Piave. So sure was I that I wrote
  to my friend Mr. Lacon Watson, who was on the Italian front, and the incident
  got into the Italian press. It could have nothing but a good effect upon
  their morale. Finally it is a matter of history how completely my impression
  was justified, and how the most shattering victory of the whole war was
  gained at that very spot.</p>

  <p>There is the fact, amply proved by documents and beyond all possible
  coincidence. As to the explanation some may say that our own subconscious
  self has power of foresight. If so it is a singularly dead instinct, seldom
  or never used. Others may say that our "dead" can see further than we, and
  try when we are asleep and in spiritual touch with us, to give us knowledge
  and consolation. The latter is my own solution of the mystery.</p>

  <p class="chaphead">A Dreadful Reception&mdash;Robert

  Cane&mdash;The Extreme Outpost&mdash;Adonis&mdash;General
  Henneque&mdash;Cyrano in the Argonne&mdash;Tir Rapide&mdash;French
  Canadian&mdash;Wound Stripes.</p><br>

  <p class="first">WHEN I got back to Paris I had a dreadful reception, for as
  I dismounted from the railway car a British military policeman in his flat
  red cap stepped up to me and saluted.</p>

  <p>"This is bad news, sir," said he.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" I gasped.</p>

  <p>"Lord Kitchener, sir. Drowned!"</p>

  <p>"Good God!" I cried.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir." Suddenly the machine turned for a moment into a human being.
  "Too much talking in this war," he said, and then in a moment was his stiff
  formal self again, and bustled off in search of deserters.</p>

  <p>Kitchener dead! The words were like clods falling on my heart. One could
  not imagine him dead, that centre of energy and vitality. With a heavy spirit
  I drove back to my old quarters at the Hotel Crillon, fuller than ever of
  red-epauletted, sword-clanking Russians. I could have cursed them, for it was
  in visiting their rotten, crumbling country that our hero had met his
  end.</p>

  <p>At the hotel I met by appointment Mr. Robert Donald, editor of the "Daily
  Chronicle," which paper had been publishing my articles. Donald, a fine,
  solid Scot, had the advantage of talking good French and being in thorough
  touch with French conditions. With him I called upon M. Clemenceau, who had
  not at that time played any conspicuous part in the war, save as violent
  critic. He lived modestly in a small house which showed that he had not used
  his power in the State and in journalism to any unfair personal advantage He
  entered, a swarthy, wrinkled, white-haired man, with the face of a crabbed
  bulldog, and a cloth cap upon his head. He reminded me of old Jim Mace the
  bruiser, as I remember him in his final phase. His eyes looked angry, and he
  had a truculent, mischievous smile. I was not impressed by the judgment he
  showed in our conversation, if a squirt on one side and Niagara on the other
  can be called conversation. He was railing loudly at the English rate of
  exchange between the franc and the pound, which seemed to me very like
  kicking against the barometer. Mr. Donald, who is a real authority upon
  finance, asked him whether France was taking the rouble at its face value;
  but the roaring voice, like a strong gramophone with a blunt needle,
  submerged all argument. Against Joffre he roared his reproaches, and
  intimated that he had some one else up his sleeve who could very soon bring
  the war to an end. A volcano of a man, dangerous sometimes to his friends,
  and sometimes to his foes. Let me acknowledge that I did not at the time
  recognize that he would ever be the opposite number to Lloyd George, and that
  the pain would lead us to victory.</p>

  <p>Donald had arranged that he and I should visit the French lines in the
  Argonne, which was as near as we could get to Verdun, where the battle was at
  its height. There were a few days to spare, however, and in the meantime I
  got a chance of going to the Soissons front, along with Leo Maxse, editor of
  the "National Review," and a M. Chevillon, who had written an excellent book
  on British co-operation in the war. Maxse, a dark little man, all nerves and
  ginger, might well plume himself that he was one of those who had foreseen
  the war and most loudly demanded preparation. Chevillon was a grey-bearded,
  father-of-a-family type, and could speak English, which promoted our closer
  acquaintance, as my French is adventurous but not always successful. A
  captain of French Intelligence, a small, silent man, took the fourth place in
  the car.</p>

  <p>When our posterity hear that it was easy to run out from Paris to the
  line, to spend a full day on the line, and to be back again in Paris for
  dinner, it will make them appreciate how close a thing was the war. We passed
  in the first instance the Woods of Villars Cotteret, where the Guards had
  turned upon the German van on September 1, 1914. Eighty Guardsmen were buried
  in the village cemetery, among them a nephew of Maxse's, to whose tomb we now
  made pious pilgrimage. Among the trees on either side of the road I noticed
  other graves of soldiers, buried where they had fallen.</p>

  <p>Soissons proved to be a considerable wreck, though it was far from being
  an Ypres. But the cathedral would, and will, make many a patriotic Frenchman
  weep. These savages cannot keep their hands off a beautiful church. Here,
  absolutely unchanged through the ages, was the spot where St. Louis had
  dedicated himself to the Crusade. Every stone of it was holy. And now the
  lovely old stained-glass strewed the floor, and the roof lay in a huge heap
  across the central aisle. A dog was climbing over it as we entered. No wonder
  the French fought well. Such sights would drive the mildest man to
  desperation. The abbé, a good priest, with a large humorous face, took us
  over his shattered domain. When I pointed out the desecration of the dog he
  shrugged his shoulders and said: "What matter? It will have to be
  reconsecrated, anyhow." He connived at my gathering up some splinters of the
  rich old stained-glass as souvenirs for my wife. He was full of reminiscences
  of the German occupation of the place. One of his personal anecdotes was
  indeed marvellous.</p>

  <p>It was that a lady in the local ambulance had vowed to kiss the first
  French soldier who re-entered the town. She did so, and it proved to be her
  husband.. The abbé was a good, kind, truthful man&mdash;but he had a humorous
  face.</p>

  <p>A walk down a ruined street brought one to the opening of the trenches.
  There were marks upon the walls of the German occupation, "Berlin-Paris,"
  with an arrow of direction, adorning one corner. At another the 76th Regiment
  had commemorated the fact that they were there in 1870 and again in 1914. If
  the Soissons folk are wise, they will keep these inscriptions as reminders to
  the rising generation. I could imagine, however, that their inclination will
  be to whitewash, fumigate, and forget.</p>

  <p>A sudden turn among some broken walls took one into the communication
  trench. Our guide was a Commandant of the Staff, a tall, thin man with hard,
  grey eyes and a severe face. It was the more severe towards us, as I gathered
  that he had been deluded into the belief that only about one out of six of
  our soldiers went to the trenches. For the moment he was not friends with the
  English. As we went along, however, we gradually got on better terms, we
  discovered a twinkle in the hard, grey eyes, and the day ended with an
  exchange of walking-sticks between him and me and a renewal of the Entente.
  May my cane grow into a marshal's baton!</p>

  <p>A charming young artillery subaltern was our guide in that maze of
  trenches, and we walked and walked and walked, with a brisk exchange of
  compliments between the "75's" of the French and the "77's" of the Germans
  going on high over our heads. The trenches were boarded at the sides, and had
  a more permanent look than those of Flanders. Presently we met a fine,
  brown-faced, upstanding boy, as keen as a razor, who commanded this
  particular section. A little farther on a helmeted captain of infantry, who
  was an expert sniper, joined our little party. Now we were at the very front
  trench. I had expected to see primeval men, bearded and shaggy. But the
  "Poilus" have disappeared. The men around me were clean and dapper to a
  remarkable degree. I gathered, however, that they had their internal
  difficulties. On one board I read an old inscription: "He is a Boche, but he
  is the inseparable companion of a French soldier." Above was a rude drawing
  of a louse.</p>

  <p>I was led to a cunning loop-hole, and had a glimpse through it of a little
  framed picture of French countryside. There were fields, a road, a sloping
  hill beyond with trees. Quite close, about 30 or 40 yards away, was a low,
  red-tiled house. "They are there," said our guide. "That is their outpost. We
  can hear them cough." Only the guns were coughing that morning, so we heard
  nothing; but it was certainly wonderful to be so near to the enemy and yet in
  such peace. I suppose wondering visitors from Berlin were brought up also to
  hear the French cough. Modern warfare has certainly some extraordinary
  sides.</p>

  <p>Then we were shown all the devices which a year of experience had
  suggested to the quick brains of our Allies. Every form of bomb, catapult,
  and trench mortar was ready to hand. Every method of cross-fire had been
  thought out to an exact degree. There was something, however, about the
  disposition of a machine gun which disturbed the Commandant. He called for
  the officer of the gun. His thin lips got thinner and his grey eyes more
  austere as we waited. Presently there emerged an extraordinarily handsome
  youth, dark as a Spaniard, from some rabbit hole. He faced the Commandant
  bravely, and answered back with respect but firmness. "Pourquoi?" asked the
  Commandant, and yet again "Pourquoi?" Adonis had an answer for everything.
  Both sides appealed to the big captain of snipers, who was clearly
  embarrassed. He stood on one leg and scratched his chin. Finally the
  Commandant turned away angrily in the midst of one of Adonis' voluble
  sentences. His face showed that the matter was not ended. War is taken very
  seriously in the French Army, and any sort of professional mistake is very
  quickly punished. Many officers of high rank had been broken by the French
  during the war. There was no more forgiveness for the beaten General than
  there was in the days of the Republic when the delegate of the National
  Convention, with a patent portable guillotine, used to drop in at
  Head-quarters to support a more vigorous offensive.</p>

  <p>It had come on to rain heavily, and we were forced to take refuge in the
  dug-out of the sniper. Eight of us sat in the deep gloom huddled closely
  together. The Commandant was still harping upon that ill-placed machine gun.
  He could not get over it. My imperfect ear for French could not follow all
  his complaints, but some defence of the offender brought forth a "Jamais!
  Jamais! Jamais!" which was rapped out as if it came from the gun itself.
  There were eight of us in an underground burrow, and some were smoking.
  Better a deluge than such an atmosphere as that. But if there was a thing
  upon earth which the French officer shied at it was rain and mud. The reason
  is that he was extraordinarily natty in his person. His charming blue
  uniform, his facings, his brown gaiters, boots and belts were always just as
  smart as paint. He was the dandy of the European War. I noticed officers in
  the trenches with their trousers carefully pressed.</p>

  <p>The rain had now stopped, and we climbed from our burrow. Again we were
  led down that endless line of communication trench, again we stumbled through
  the ruins, again we emerged into the street where our cars were awaiting us.
  Above our heads the sharp artillery duel was going merrily forward. The
  French were firing three or four to one, which had been my experience at
  every point I had touched upon the Allied front. Thanks to the extraordinary
  zeal of the French workers, especially of the French women, and to the clever
  adoption of machinery by their engineers, their supplies were abundant.</p>

  <p>Our next expedition carried us to Chalons, where the Huns of old met
  disaster. From Chalons we drove some twenty miles to St. Menehould, and
  learned that the trenches were about ten miles north. On this expedition
  there were Donald and I with an extraordinary Spaniard, half Don Quixote,
  half Gipsy troubadour, flat hatted and clad in brown corduroy, with a single
  arm, having, as we heard, lost the other in some broil. As he spoke no tongue
  but his own we were never on terms with him.</p>

  <p>The front at the sector which we struck was under the control of General
  Henneque of the 10th Division. A fine soldier this, and Heaven help Germany
  if he and his division had invaded it, for he was, as one could see at a
  glance, a man of iron who had been goaded to fierceness by all that his
  beloved country had endured. He was a man of middle size, swarthy, hawk-like,
  very abrupt in his movements, with two steel-grey eyes, which were the most
  searching that mine have ever met. His hospitality and courtesy to us were
  beyond all bounds, but there is another side to him, and it is one which it
  were wiser not to provoke. In person he took us to his lines, passing through
  the usual shot-torn villages behind them. Where the road dipped down into the
  great forest there was one particular spot which was visible to the German
  artillery observers. The General mentioned it at the time, but his remark
  seemed to have no personal interest. We understood it better on our return in
  the evening.</p>

  <p>We then found ourselves in the depths of the woods&mdash;primeval woods of
  oak and beech in the deep clay soil that the great oak loves. There had been
  rain, and the forest paths were ankle deep in mire. Everywhere, to right and
  left, soldiers' faces, hard and rough from a year of open air, gazed up at us
  from their burrows in the ground. Presently an alert, blue-clad figure stood
  in the path to greet us. It was the Colonel of the sector. He was
  ridiculously like Cyrano de Bergerac as depicted by the late M. Coquelin,
  save that his nose was of more moderate proportion. The ruddy colouring, the
  bristling, feline, full-ended moustache, the solidity of pose, the backward
  tilt of the head, the general suggestion of the bantam cock, were all there
  facing us as he stood amid the leaves in the sunlight. Gauntlets and a long
  rapier&mdash;nothing else was wanting. Something had amused Cyrano. His
  moustache quivered with suppressed mirth and his blue eyes were demurely
  gleaming. Then the joke came out. He had spotted a German working-party, his
  guns had concentrated on it, and afterwards he had seen the stretchers go
  forward. A grim joke, it may seem. But the French saw this war from a
  different angle to us. If we had had the Boche sitting on our heads for two
  years, and were not quite sure whether we could ever get him off again, we
  should get Cyrano's point of view.</p>

  <p>We passed in a little procession among the French soldiers, and viewed
  their multifarious arrangements. For them we were a little break in a
  monotonous life, and they formed up in lines as we passed. My own British
  uniform and the civilian dresses of my two companions interested them. As the
  General passed these groups, who formed themselves up in perhaps a more
  familiar manner than would have been usual in the British service, he glanced
  kindly at them with those singular eyes of his, and once or twice addressed
  them as "Mes enfants." One might conceive that all was "go as you please"
  among the French. So it was as long as you went in the right way. When you
  strayed from it you knew it. As we passed a group of men standing on a low
  ridge which overlooked us there was a sudden stop. I gazed round. The
  General's face was steel and cement. The eyes were cold and yet fiery,
  sunlight upon icicles. Something had happened. Cyrano had sprung to his side.
  His reddish moustache had shot forward beyond his nose, and it bristled out
  like that of an angry cat. Both were looking up at the group above us. One
  wretched man detached himself from his comrades and sidled down the slope. No
  skipper and mate of a Yankee blood boat could have looked more ferociously at
  a mutineer. And yet it was all over some minor breach of discipline which was
  summarily disposed of by two days of confinement. Then in an instant the
  faces relaxed, there was a general buzz of relief, and we were back at "Mes
  enfants" again.</p>

  <p>Trenches are trenches, and the main speciality of those in the Argonne
  were that they were nearer to the enemy. In fact, there were places where
  they interlocked, and where the advanced posts lay cheek by jowl with a good
  steel plate to cover both cheek and jowl. We were brought to a sap-head where
  the Germans were at the other side of a narrow forest road. Had I leaned
  forward with extended hand and a Boche done the same we could have touched. I
  looked across, but saw only a tangle of wire and sticks. Even whispering was
  not permitted in those forward posts.</p>

  <p>When we emerged from these hushed places of danger Cyrano took us all to
  his dug-out, which was a tasty little cottage carved from the side of a hill
  and faced with logs. He did the honours of the humble cabin with the air of a
  seigneur in his château. There was little furniture, but from some broken
  mansion he had extracted an iron fire-back, which adorned his grate. It was a
  fine, mediaeval bit of work, with Venus, in her traditional costume, in the
  centre of it. It seemed the last touch in the picture of the gallant virile
  Cyrano. I only met him this once, nor shall I ever see him again, yet he
  stands a thing complete within my memory. Always in the cinema of memory he
  will walk the leafy paths of the Argonne, his fierce eyes searching for the
  Boche workers, his red moustache bristling over their annihilation. He seems
  a figure out of the past of France.</p>

  <p>That night we dined with yet another type of the French soldier, General
  Antoine, who commanded the corps of which my friend had one division. Each of
  these French generals had a striking individuality of his own which I wish I
  could fix upon paper. Their only common point was that each seemed to be a
  rare good soldier. The Corps General was Athos with a touch of d'Artagnan. He
  was well over 6 feet high, bluff, jovial, with huge, upcurling moustache, and
  a voice that would rally a regiment. It was a grand figure, which should have
  been done by Van Dyck, with lace collar, hand on sword, and arm akimbo.
  Jovial and laughing was he, but a stern and hard soldier was lurking behind
  the smiles. His name has appeared in history, and so has Humbert's, who ruled
  all the army of which the other corps is a unit. Humbert was a Lord Robert's
  figure, small, wiry, quick-stepping, all steel and elastic, with a short,
  upturned moustache, which one could imagine as crackling with electricity in
  moments of excitement like a cat's fur. What he does or says is quick,
  abrupt, and to the point. He fires his remarks like pistol shots at this man
  or that. Once to my horror he fixed me with his hard little eyes and
  demanded; "Sherlock Holmes, est-ce qu'il est un soldat dans l'armée
  Anglaise?" The whole table waited in an awful hush. "Mais, mon general," I
  stammered, "it est trop vieux pour service." There was general laughter, and
  I felt that I had scrambled out of an awkward place.</p>

  <p>And talking of awkward places, I had forgotten about that spot upon the
  road whence the Boche observer could see our motor-cars. He had actually laid
  a gun upon it, the rascal, and waited all the long day for our return. No
  sooner did we appear upon the slope than a shrapnel shell burst above us, but
  somewhat behind me, as well as to the left. Had it been straight the second
  car would have got it, and there might have been a vacancy in one of the
  chief editorial chairs in London. The General shouted to the driver to speed
  up, and we were soon safe from the German gunners. One got perfectly immune
  to noises in these scenes, for the guns which surrounded you made louder
  crashes than any shell which burst about you. It is only when you actually
  saw the cloud over you that your thoughts came back to yourself, and that you
  realized that in this wonderful drama you might be a useless super, but none
  the less you were on the stage and not in the stalls.</p>

  <p>Next morning we were down in the front trenches again at another portion
  of the line. Far away on our right, from a spot named the Observatory, we
  could see the extreme left of the Verdun position and shells bursting on the
  Fille Morte. To the north of us was a broad expanse of sunny France, nestling
  villages, scattered châteaux, rustic churches, and all as inaccessible as if
  it were the moon. It was a terrible thing this German bar&mdash;a thing
  unthinkable to Britons. To stand on the edge of Yorkshire and look into
  Lancashire feeling that it was in other hands, that our fellow-countrymen
  were suffering there and waiting, waiting for help, and that we could not,
  after two years, come a yard nearer to them&mdash;would it not break our
  hearts? Could I wonder that there was no smile upon the grim faces of those
  Frenchmen! But when the bar was There was one little gun which fascinated me,
  and I stood for some time watching it. Its three gunners, enormous helmeted
  men, evidently loved it, and touched it with a swift but tender touch in
  every movement. When it was fired it ran up an inclined plane to take off the
  recoil, rushing up and then turning and rattling down again upon the gunners
  who were used to its ways. The first time it did it, I was standing behind
  it, and I don't know which jumped quickest&mdash;the gun or I.</p>

  <p>French officers above a certain rank develop and show their own
  individuality. In the lower grades the conditions of service enforce a
  certain uniformity. The British officer is a British gentleman first, and an
  officer afterwards. The Frenchman is an officer first, though none the less
  the gentleman stands behind it. One very strange type we met, however, in
  these Argonne Woods. He was a French-Canadian who had been a French soldier,
  had founded a homestead in far Alberta, and had now come back of his own
  will, though a naturalized Briton, to the old flag. He spoke English of a
  kind, the quality and quantity being equally extraordinary. It poured from
  him and was, so far as it was intelligible, of the woolly Western variety.
  His views on the Germans were the most emphatic we had met. "These Godam sons
  of"&mdash;well, let us say "Canines!" he would shriek, shaking his fist at
  the woods to the north of him. A good man was our compatriot, for he had a
  very recent Legion of Honour pinned upon his breast. He had been put with a
  few men on Hill 285, a sort of volcano stuffed with mines, and was told to
  telephone when he needed relief. He refused to telephone, and remained there
  for three weeks. "We sit like one rabbit in his hall," he explained. He had
  only one grievance&mdash;there were many wild boars in the forest, but the
  infantry were too busy to get them. "The Godam Artillaree he get the wild
  pig!" Out of his pocket he pulled a picture of a frame house with snow round
  it, and a lady with two children on the stoep. It was his homestead at
  Trochu, seventy miles north of Calgary.</p>

  <p>It was the evening of the third day that we turned our faces towards Paris
  once more. It was my last view of the French. The roar of their guns went far
  with me upon my way. I wrote at the time: "Soldiers of France, farewell! In
  your own phrase, I salute you! Many have seen you who had more knowledge by
  which to judge your manifold virtues, many also who had more skill to draw
  you as you are, but never one, I am sure, who admired you more than I. Great
  was the French soldier, under Louis the Sun-King, great too under Napoleon,
  but never was he greater than to-day."</p>

  <p>But in spite of all their bravery only two things saved France, her field
  guns and the intervention of England. Surely she should have a reckoning with
  her pre-war military authorities. Imagine unwarlike Britain, protected by the
  sea, and yet having a high standard of musketry, heavy guns with every
  division, and khaki uniforms, while warlike France, under the very shadow of
  Germany, had poor musketry, primeval uniforms and no heavy guns. As to her
  early views of strategy they were lamentable. Every British critic, above all
  Lord Kitchener, knew that the attack would swing round through Belgium.
  France concentrated all her preparation upon the Eastern frontier. It was
  clear also that the weaker power should be on the defensive and so bring her
  enemy by heavier losses down to her own weight. France attacked and broke
  herself in an impossible venture. There should have been a heavy reckoning
  against some one. The fate of England as well as of France was imperilled by
  the false estimates of the French General Staff.</p>

  <p>One small visible result of my journey was the establishment of wound
  stripes upon the uniforms of the British. I had been struck by this very
  human touch among the French, which gave a man some credit and therefore some
  consolation for his sufferings. I represented the matter when I came back.
  Lest I seem to claim more than is true, I append General Robertson's letter.
  The second sentence refers to that campaign for the use of armour which I had
  prosecuted so long, and with some success as regards helmets, though there
  the credit was mostly due to Dr. Saleeby, among civilians. The letter runs
  thus:</p>

  <p class="letter">WAR OFFICE,<br>
  <i>August</i> 14, 1916.<br>
  <br>
  Many thanks for sending me a copy of your little book. I will certainly see
  what can be done in regard to armour. You will remember that I took your
  previous tip as regards badges for wounded men.<br>
  <br>
  Yours very truly,<br>
  W. R. ROBERTSON.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-31"
     id="ch-31"></a>XXXI &mdash; BREAKING THE HINDENBURG LINE</h2>

  <p class="chaphead">Lloyd George&mdash;My Second Excursion&mdash;The Farthest
  German Point&mdash;Sir Joseph Cook&mdash;Night before the Day of
  Judgment&mdash;The Final Battle&mdash;On a Tank&mdash;Horrible
  Sight&mdash;Speech to Australians&mdash;The Magic Carpet.</p><br>

  <p class="first">I FIND in my diary that the Prime Minister, Mr. Lloyd
  George, invited me to breakfast in April 1917. Some third person was, I
  understand, to have been present, but he did not arrive, so that I found
  myself alone in the classic dining-room of No. 10, Downing Street, while my
  host was finishing his toilet. Presently he appeared, clad in a grey suit,
  smart and smiling, with no sign at all that he bore the weight of the great
  European War upon his shoulders. Nothing could have been more affable or
  democratic, for there was no servant present, and he poured out the tea,
  while I, from a side table, brought the bacon and eggs for both. He had
  certainly the Celtic power of making one absolutely at one's ease, for there
  was no trace at all of pomp or ceremony&mdash;just a pleasant, smiling,
  grey-haired but very virile gentleman, with twinkling eyes and a roguish
  smile. No doubt there are other aspects, but that is how he presented himself
  that morning.</p>

  <p>He began by talking about the great loss which the country had sustained
  in Lord Kitchener's death, speaking of him in a very kindly and human way. At
  the same time he was of opinion that long tropical service and the habit of
  always talking down to subordinates had had some effect upon his mind and
  character. He was a strange mixture of rather morose inactivity and sudden
  flashes of prevision which amounted to genius. He was the only man who had
  clearly foreseen the length of the war, and but for Turkey, Bulgaria, and
  other complications he probably overstated it at three years. There were
  times when he became so dictatorial as to be almost unbearable, and he had to
  be reminded at a Cabinet Council by Lloyd George himself that he was in the
  presence of twenty men who were his peers, and that he could not refuse them
  information or act above their heads. I confess that it struck me as very
  natural that a big man with vital knowledge in his brain should hesitate in a
  world crisis to confide it to twenty men, and probably twenty wives, each of
  whom was a possible leak. In spite of his genius Kitchener was not accessible
  to new ideas. He could not see clearly why such enormous munitions were
  necessary. He opposed tanks. He was against the Irish and Welsh separate
  divisions. He refused the special flags which the ladies had worked for these
  divisions. He was as remote from sentiment as a steam hammer, and yet he was
  dealing with humans who can be influenced by sentiment. He obstructed in many
  things, particularly in the Dardanelles. On the other hand, his steps in
  organizing the new armies were splendid, though he had
  attempted&mdash;vainly&mdash;to do away with the Territorials, another
  example of his blindness to the practical force of sentiment. Miss Asquith
  had said of him, "If he is not a great man he is a great poster," and
  certainly no one else could have moved the nation to such a degree, though
  the long series of provocations from the Germans had made us very receptive
  and combative.</p>

  <p>Lloyd George was justly proud of the splendid work of the Welsh Division
  at the front. He had been to Mametz Wood, the taking of which had been such a
  bloody, and also such a glorious, business. He listened with interest to an
  account which I was able to give him of some incidents in that fight, and
  said that it was a beautiful story. He had arranged for a Welsh painter to do
  the scene of the battle.</p>

  <p>He was interested to hear how I had worked upon my history, and remarked
  that it was probably better done from direct human documents than from filed
  papers. He asked me whether I had met many of the divisional Generals, and on
  my saying that I had, he asked me if any had struck me as outstanding among
  their fellows. I said I thought they were a fine level lot, but that in
  soldiering it was impossible to say by mere talk or appearance who was the
  big man at a pinch. He agreed. He seemed to have a particular feeling towards
  General Tom Bridges, of the 19th Division, and shortly afterwards I noticed
  that he was chosen for the American mission.</p>

  <p>I talked to him about my views as to the use of armour, and found him very
  keen upon it. He is an excellent listener, and seems honestly interested in
  what you say. He said he had no doubt that in the problem of armour lay the
  future of warfare, but how to carry it was the crux. He said that the
  soldiers always obstructed the idea&mdash;which was my experience
  also&mdash;with a few notable exceptions. I mentioned General Watts of the
  7th Division as being interested in armour, and he agreed and seemed to know
  all about Watts who, though a "dug-out," was one of the finds of the war.</p>

  <p>He was much excited about the revolution in Russia, news of which had only
  just come through. The Guards had turned, and that meant that all had turned.
  The Tsar was good but weak. The general character and probable fate of the
  Tsarina were not unlike those of Marie Antoinette&mdash;in fact, the whole
  course of events was very analogous to the French Revolution. "Then it will
  last some years and end in a Napoleon," said I. He agreed. The revolt, he
  said, was in no sense pro-German. The whole affair had been Byzantine, and
  reminded one of the old histories.</p>

  <p>As I left he came back to armour, and said that he was about to see some
  one on that very subject. When I was in the hall it struck me that a few
  definite facts which I had in my head would be useful in such an interview,
  so, to the surprise of the butler, I sat down on the hall chair and wrote out
  on a scrap of paper a few headings which I asked him to give the Prime
  Minister. I don't know if they were of any use. I came away reassured, and
  feeling that a vigorous virile hand was at the helm.</p>

  <p>I had not expected to see any more actual operations of the war, but early
  in September 1918 I had an intimation from the Australian Government that I
  might visit their section of the line. Little did I think that this would
  lead to my seeing the crowning battle of the war. It was on September 26 that
  we actually started, the party consisting of Sir Joseph Cook, Naval Minister
  of the Australian Commonwealth, Commander Latham, his aide-de-camp, who in
  civil life is a rising barrister of Melbourne, and Mr. Berry, soon to be Sir
  William Berry, proprietor of the "Sunday Times." We crossed in a gale of
  wind, with a destroyer sheeted in foam on either side of the leave boat, each
  of us being obliged to wear life-belts. Several American newspaper men were
  on board, one of them an old friend, Bok, of the "Ladies' Home Journal." It
  was too late to continue our journey when we got across, so we stayed at an
  inn that night, and were off to the Australian line at an early hour in the
  morning, our way lying through Abbeville and Amiens. The latter place was
  nearly deserted and very badly knocked about, far more so than I had
  expected.</p>

  <p>The enemy had, as we knew, been within seven miles of Amiens&mdash;it was
  the Australian line which held the town safe, and the Allied cause from
  desperate peril if not ruin. It did not surprise us, therefore, that we soon
  came upon signs of fighting. A little grove was shown us as the absolute
  farthest ripple of the advanced German wave. A little farther on was the
  sheltered town of Villers Brettoneux, with piles of empty cartridge cases at
  every corner to show where snipers or machine guns had lurked. A little
  farther on a truly monstrous gun&mdash;the largest I have ever seen&mdash;lay
  near the road, broken into three pieces. It was bigger to my eyes than the
  largest on our battleships, and had been brought up and mounted by the
  Germans just before the tide had turned, which was on July 5. In their
  retreat they had been compelled to blow it up. A party of British Guardsmen
  were standing round it examining it, and I exchanged a few words with them.
  Then we ran on through ground which was intensely interesting to me, as it
  was the scene of Gough's retreat, and I had just been carefully studying it
  at home. There was the Somme on our left, a very placid, slow-moving stream,
  and across it the higher ground where our III Corps had been held up on the
  historical August 8, the day which made Ludendorff realize, as he himself
  states, that the war was lost. On the plain over which we were moving the
  Australian and Canadian Divisions had swept, with the tanks leading the
  British line, as Boadicea's chariots did of old. Though I had not been over
  the ground before, I had visualized it so clearly in making notes about the
  battle that I could name every hamlet and locate every shattered church
  tower. Presently a hill rose on the left, which I knew to be Mount St.
  Quentin, the taking of which by the Australians was one of the feats of the
  war. It had been defended by picked troops, including some of the Prussian
  Guards, but they were mostly taken or killed, though a flanking attack by the
  British Yeomanry Division had something to do with the result.</p>

  <p>The old walled town of Peronne, sacred for ever to Sir Walter, Quentin
  Durward, and the archers of the Scots Guards, lay before us, almost if not
  quite surrounded by the river, the canal, and broad moats. It seemed an
  impossible place to take, which is of course the greatest possible trap in
  modern warfare, since something occurring fifty miles away may place troops
  behind you and cut you off. Here our long drive finished, and we were handed
  over to the care of Colonel Bennett, commanding the camp, a tall, bluff
  warrior who, if he had doffed his khaki and got into a velvet tunic, would
  have been the exact image of the veteran warrior in Scott's novel. He was
  indeed a veteran, having fought, if I remember right, not only in South
  Africa, but even in the Australian Suakim contingent.</p>

  <p>A little wooden hut was put at our disposal, and there we slept, Sir
  Joseph Cook and I, with a small partition between us. I was bitterly cold,
  and so I can tell was he, for I could hear him tossing about just as I did
  for warmth. We had neither of us made the discovery that you may pile all the
  clothes you like on the top of you, but so long as there is only one layer of
  canvas beneath you, you are likely to be cold. We don't usually realize that
  the mattress is also part of the bedclothes. We both got little sleep that
  night.</p>

  <p>Next morning, September 28, we were off betimes, for we had much to see,
  the old town for one thing, which I vowed I would visit again in time of
  peace. We descended Mount St. Quentin and saw ample evidence of the grim
  struggle that had occurred there. There were many rude graves, some of them
  with strange inscriptions. One of them, I was told, read: "Here lies a German
  who met two diggers." The Australian Tommy was of course universally known as
  a digger. They make a rough, valiant, sporting but rude-handed crew. They
  went through the prisoners for loot, and even the officers were ransacked.
  Colonel Bennett told me that a Colonel of the Germans was impudent when he
  came into his presence, so Bennett said: "Mend your manners, or I will hand
  you over to the diggers!" They were waiting outside the tent for just such a
  chance. One German had an iron cross which was snatched from him by an
  Australian. The German shaped up to the man in excellent form and knocked him
  down. The other Australians were delighted, gave him back his cross, and made
  him quite a hero. I expect the looter had been an unpopular man.</p>

  <p>The younger Australian officers were all promoted from the ranks, and many
  of them had their own ideas about English grammar. Bennett told me that he
  tried to get the reports better written. One subaltern had reported: "As I
  came round the traverse I met a Bosch and we both reached for our guns, but
  he lost his block and I got him." Bennett returned this for emendation. It
  came back: "As I came round the traverse I met a German, and we both drew our
  automatic pistols, but he lost his presence of mind and I shot him." I think
  I like the first style best.</p>

  <p>I lunched that day at the Head-quarters of Sir John Monash, an excellent
  soldier who had done really splendid work, especially since the advance
  began. Indeed, it was his own action on July 5 which turned the tide of
  retreat. He showed that the long line of fighting Jews which began with
  Joshua still carries on. One of the Australian Divisional Generals,
  Rosenthal, was also a Jew, and the Head-quarters Staff was full of
  eagle-nosed, black-haired warriors. It spoke well for them and well also for
  the perfect equality of the Australian system, which would have the best man
  at the top, be he who he might. My brother was acting as Assistant
  Adjutant-General to General Butler with the III British Corps on the left of
  the Australians, and they had kindly wired for him, so that I had the joy of
  having him next me at lunch, and he invited me to join the Head-quarters mess
  of his corps for dinner.</p>

  <p>It was a wonderful experience that dinner. The great advance was to be
  next morning, when it was hoped that the Hindenburg Line, which was
  practically the frontier of Germany, would be carried. There were only six
  who dined in that little farm-house messroom Butler himself with hard
  composed face, his head of sappers, head of gunners, my brother, the first
  and second Staff officers, a little group of harassed and weary men. Yet
  there was no word of the huge drama upon the edge of which we were standing.
  Every now and then a telephone tinkled in the next room, a Staff officer
  rose, there were a few short words, a nod, and the incident was closed. It
  was a wonderful example of quiet self-control. I said to my brother, when we
  were alone: "Don't you think I am out of the picture at such a moment talking
  about such frivolous things?" "For God's sake keep on at it," he said. "It is
  just what they need. Give their brains something new." So I tried to do so
  and we had a memorable evening I shall never forget the drive back of 10
  miles in a pitch-dark night, with not a gleam anywhere save that far aloft
  two little gold points glimmered now and again, like the far-off headlights
  of a motor transferred suddenly to the heavens. These were British
  aeroplanes, so lit to distinguish them from the German marauders. The whole
  Eastern horizon was yellow-red with gunfire, and the distant roar of the
  artillery preparation was like the Atlantic surge upon a rock-bound coast.
  Along the road no lights were permitted, and several times out of the black a
  still blacker gloom framed itself into some motor-lorry with which only our
  cries saved a collision. It was wonderful and awesome, the eve of the day of
  judgment when Germany's last solid defence was to be smashed, and she was to
  be left open to that vengeance which she had so long provoked.</p>

  <p>We were awakened early, part of our party getting away to some point which
  they imagined would be more adventurous than that to which we seniors should
  be invited, though in the sequel it hardly proved so. They saw much, however,
  and one of them described to me how one of the first and saddest sights was
  that of eighteen splendid young Americans lying dead and lonely by the
  roadside, caught in some unlucky shell burst. Mr. Cook, Commander Latham, and
  I had been placed under the charge of Captain Plunket, a twice-wounded
  Australian officer, who helped us much during the varied adventures of our
  exciting day.</p>

  <p>The general programme of attack was already in our minds. Two American
  divisions, the 27th and 30th, one from New York, the other from the South,
  were to rush the front line. The Australian divisions were then to pass over
  or through them and carry the battlefront forward. Already, as we arrived on
  the battlefield, the glad news came back that the Americans had done their
  part, and that the Australians had just been unleashed. Also that the Germans
  were standing to it like men.</p>

  <p>As our car threaded the crowded street between the ruins of Templeux we
  met the wounded coming back, covered cars with nothing visible save
  protruding boots, and a constant stream of pedestrians, some limping, some
  with bandaged arms and faces, some supported by Red Cross men, a few-in pain,
  most of them smiling grimly behind their cigarettes. Amid them came the first
  clump of prisoners, fifty or more, pitiable enough, and yet I could not pity
  them, the weary, shuffling, hang-dog creatures, with no touch of nobility in
  their features or their bearing.</p>

  <p>The village was full of Americans and Australians, extraordinarily like
  each other in type. One could well have lingered, for it was all of great
  interest, but there were even greater interests ahead, so we turned up a
  hill, left our car, which had reached its limit, and proceeded on foot. The
  road took us through a farm, where a British anti-aircraft battery stood
  ready for action. Then we found open plain, and went forward, amid old
  trenches and rusty wire, in the direction of the battle.</p>

  <p>We had now passed the heavy gun positions, and were among the field guns,
  so that the noise was deafening. A British howitzer battery was hard at work,
  and we stopped to chat with the Major. His crews had been at it for six
  hours, but were in great good humour, and chuckled mightily when the blast of
  one of their guns nearly drove in our ear-drums, we having got rather too far
  forward. The effect was that of a ringing box on the exposed ear&mdash;with
  which valediction we left our grinning British gunners and pushed on to the
  east, under a screaming canopy of our own shells. The wild, empty waste of
  moor was broken by a single shallow quarry or gravel-pit, in which we could
  see some movement. In it we found an advanced dressing station, with about a
  hundred American and Australian gunners and orderlies. There were dug-outs in
  the sides of this flat excavation, and it had been an American battalion
  Head-quarters up to a few hours before. We were now about 1,000 yards from
  the Hindenburg Line, and I learned with emotion that this spot was the Egg
  Redoubt, one of those advanced outposts of General Gough's army which
  suffered so tragic and glorious a fate in that great military epic of March
  21&mdash;one of the grandest in the whole war. The fact that we were now
  actually standing in the Egg Redoubt showed me, as nothing else could have
  done, how completely the ground had been recovered, and how the day of
  retribution was at hand.</p>

  <p>We were standing near the eastward lip of the excavation, and looking over
  it, when it was first brought to our attention that it took two to make a
  battle. Up to now we had seen only one. Now two shells burst in quick
  succession 40 yards in front of us, and a spray of earth went into the air.
  "Whizz-bangs," remarked our soldier-guide casually. Personally, I felt less
  keenly interested in their name than in the fact that they were there at
  all.</p>

  <p>We thought we had done pretty well to get within 1,000 yards of the famous
  line, but now came a crowning bit of good fortune, for an Australian gunner
  captain, a mere lad, but a soldier from his hawk's eyes to his active feet,
  volunteered to rush us forward to some coign of vantage known to himself. So
  it was Eastward Ho! once more, still over a dull, barren plain sloping gently
  upwards, with little sign of life. Here and there was the quick fluff of a
  bursting shell, but at a comfortable distance. Suddenly ahead of us a
  definite object broke the skyline. It was a Tank, upon which the crew were
  working with spanners and levers, for its comrades were now far ahead, and it
  would fain follow. This, it seems, was the grandstand which our young gunner
  had selected. On to the top of it we clambered&mdash;and there, at our very
  feet, and less than 500 yards away, was the rift which had been torn a few
  hours before in the Hindenburg Line. On the dun slope beyond it, under our
  very eyes, was even now being fought a part of that great fight where at last
  the children of light were beating down into the earth the forces of
  darkness. It was there. We could see it. And yet how little there was to
  see!</p>

  <p>The ridge was passed, and the ground sloped down, as dark and heathy as
  Hindhead. In front of us lay a village. It was Bellicourt. The Hindenburg
  position ran through it. It lay quiet enough, and with the unaided eye one
  could see rusty red fields of wire in front of it. But the wire had availed
  nothing, nor had the trench that lurked behind it, for beyond it, beside the
  village of Nauroy, there was a long white line, clouds of pale steam-like
  vapour spouting up against a dark, rain-sodden sky. "The Boche smoke
  barrage," said our guide. "They are going to counter-attack." Only this, the
  long, white, swirling cloud upon the dark plain told of the strife in front
  of us. With my glasses I saw what looked like Tanks, but whether wrecked or
  in action I could not say. There was the battle&mdash;the greatest of
  battles&mdash;but nowhere could I see a moving figure. It is true that all
  the noises of the pit seemed to rise from that lonely landscape, but noise
  was always with us, go where we would.</p>

  <p>The Australians were ahead where that line of smoke marked their progress.
  In the sloping fields, which at that point emerged out of the moor, the
  victorious Americans, who had done their part, were crouching. It was an
  assured victory upon which we gazed, achieved so rapidly that we were
  ourselves standing far forward in ground which had been won that day. The
  wounded had been brought in, and I saw no corpses. On the left the fight was
  very severe, and the Germans, who had been hidden in their huge dug-outs,
  were doing their usual trick of emerging and cutting off the attack. So much
  we gathered afterwards, but for the moment it was the panorama before us
  which was engrossing all our thoughts.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the German guns woke up. I can but pray that it was not our group
  which drew their fire upon the half-mended tank. Shell after shell fell in
  its direction, all of them short, but creeping forward with each salvo. It
  was time for us to go. If any man says that without a call of duty he likes
  being under aimed shellfire, he is not a man whose word I would trust. Some
  of the shells burst with a rusty-red out-flame, and we were told that they
  were gas shells. I may say that before we were admitted on to the
  battle-field at all, we were ushered one by one into a room where some
  devil's pipkin was bubbling in the corner, and were taught to use our
  gas-masks by the simple expedient of telling us that if we failed to acquire
  the art then and there a very painful alternative was awaiting us.</p>

  <p>We made our way back, with no indecent haste, but certainly without
  loitering, across the plain, the shells always getting rather nearer, until
  we came to the excavation. Here we had a welcome rest, for our good gunner
  took us into his cubby-hole of a dug-out, which would at least stop shrapnel,
  and we shared his tea and dried beef, a true Australian soldier's meal.</p>

  <p>The German fire was now rather heavy, and our expert host explained that
  this meant that he had recovered from the shock of the attack, had
  reorganized his guns, and was generally his merry self once more. From where
  we sat we could see heavy shells bursting far to our rear, and there was an
  atmosphere of explosion all round us, which might have seemed alarming had it
  not been for the general chatty afternoon-tea appearance of all these veteran
  soldiers with whom it was our privilege to find ourselves. A group of
  sulky-looking German prisoners sat in a corner, while a lank and freckled
  Australian soldier, with his knee sticking out of a rent in his trousers, was
  walking about with four watches dangling from his hand, endeavouring vainly
  to sell them. Far be it from me to assert that he did not bring the watches
  from Sydney and choose this moment for doing a deal in them, but they were
  heavy old Teutonic time-pieces, and the prisoners seemed to take a rather
  personal interest in them.</p>

  <p>As we started on our homeward track we came, first, upon the British
  battery which seemed to be limbering up with some idea of advancing, and so
  lost its chance of administering a box on our other ear. Farther still we met
  our friends of the air guns, and stopped again to exchange a few impressions.
  They had nothing to fire at, and seemed bored to tears, for the red, white
  and blue machines were in full command of the sky. Soon we found our motor
  waiting in the lee of a ruined house, and began to thread our way back
  through the wonderfully picturesque streams of men&mdash;American,
  Australian, British, and German&mdash;who were strung along the road.</p>

  <p>And then occurred a very horrible incident. One knew, of course, that one
  could not wander about a battle-field and not find oneself sooner or later
  involved in some tragedy, but we were now out of range of any but heavy guns,
  and their shots were spasmodic. We had halted the car for an instant to
  gather up two German helmets which Commander Latham had seen on the roadside,
  when there was a very heavy burst close ahead round a curve in the village
  street. A geyser of red brick-dust flew up into the air. An instant later our
  car rounded the corner. None of us will forget what we saw. There was a
  tangle of mutilated horses, their necks rising and sinking. Beside them a man
  with his hand blown off was staggering away, the blood gushing from his
  upturned sleeve. He was moving round and holding the arm raised and hanging,
  as a dog holds an injured foot. Beside the horses lay a shattered man,
  drenched crimson from head to foot, with two great glazed eyes looking
  upwards through a mask of blood. Two comrades were at hand to help, and we
  could only go upon our way with the ghastly picture stamped for ever upon our
  memory. The image of that dead driver might well haunt one in one's
  dreams.</p>

  <p>Once through Templeux and on the main road for Peronne things became less
  exciting, and we drew up to see a column of 900 prisoners pass us. Each side
  of the causeway was lined by Australians, with their keen, clear-cut, falcon
  faces, and between lurched these heavy-jawed, beetle-browed, uncouth louts,
  new caught and staring round with bewildered eyes at their debonair captors.
  I saw none of that relief at getting out of it which I have read of; nor did
  I see any signs of fear, but the prevailing impression was an ox-like
  stolidity and dullness. It was a herd of beasts, not a procession of men. It
  was indeed farcical to think that these uniformed bumpkins represented the
  great military nation, while the gallant figures who lined the road belonged
  to the race which they had despised as being unwarlike. Time and Fate between
  them have a pretty sense of humour. One of them caught my eye as he passed
  and roared out in guttural English, "The old Jairman is out!" It was the only
  words I heard them speak. French cavalry troopers, stern, dignified, and
  martial, rode at either end of the bedraggled procession.</p>

  <p>They were great soldiers, these Australians. I think they would admit it
  themselves, but a spectator is bound to confirm it. There was a reckless
  dare-devilry, combined with a spice of cunning, which gave them a place of
  their own in the Imperial ranks. They had a great advantage too, in having a
  permanent organization, the same five divisions always in the same corps,
  under the same chief. It doubled their military value&mdash;and the same
  applied equally, of course, to the Canadians. None the less, they should not
  undervalue their British comrades or lose their sense of proportion. I had a
  chance of addressing some 1,200 of them on our return that evening, and while
  telling them all that I thought of their splendid deeds, I ventured to remind
  them that 72 per cent of the men engaged and 76 per cent of the casualties
  were Englishmen of England.</p>

  <p>I think that now, in these after-war days, the whole world needs to be
  reminded of this fact as well as the Australians did. There has been, it
  seems to me, a systematic depreciation of what the glorious English, apart
  from the British, soldiers did. England is too big to be provincial, and
  smaller minds sometimes take advantage of it. At the time some of the
  Australian papers slanged me for having given this speech to their soldiers,
  but I felt that it needed saying, and several of their officers thanked me
  warmly, saying that as they never saw anything save their own front, they
  were all of them losing their sense of proportion. I shall not easily forget
  that speech, I standing on a mound in the rain, the Australian soldiers with
  cloaks swathed round them like brigands, and half a dozen aeroplanes,
  returning from the battle, circling overhead, evidently curious as to what
  was going on. It seems to me now like some extraordinary dream.</p>

  <p>Such was my scamper to the Australian front. It was as if some huge hand
  had lifted me from my study table, placed me where I could see what I was
  writing about, and then within four days laid me down once more before the
  familiar table, with one more wonderful experience added to my record.</p>

  <p>And then at last came the blessed day of Armistice. I was in a staid
  London hotel at eleven o'clock in the morning, most prim of all the hours of
  the day, when a lady, well-dressed and conventional, came through the turning
  doors, waltzed slowly round the hall with a flag in either hand, and departed
  without saying a word. It was the first sign that things were happening. I
  rushed out into the streets, and of course the news was everywhere at once. I
  walked down to Buckingham Palace and saw the crowds assembling there, singing
  and cheering. A slim, young girl had got elevated on to some high vehicle,
  and was leading and conducting the singing as if she was some angel in tweeds
  just dropped from a cloud. In the dense crowd I saw an open motor stop with
  four middle-aged men, one of them a hard-faced civilian, the others officers.
  I saw this civilian hack at the neck of a whisky bottle and drink it raw. I
  wish the crowd had lynched him. It was the moment for prayer, and this beast
  was a blot on the landscape. On the whole the people were very good and
  orderly. Later more exuberant elements got loose. They say that it was when
  the Australian wounded met the War Office flappers that the foundations of
  solid old London got loosened. But we have little to be ashamed of, and if
  ever folk rejoiced we surely had the right to do so. We did not see the new
  troubles ahead of us, but at least these old ones were behind. And we had
  gained an immense reassurance. Britain had not weakened. She was still the
  Britain of old.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-32"
     id="ch-32"></a>XXXII &mdash; THE PSYCHIC QUEST</h2>

  <p>I have not obtruded the psychic question upon the reader, though it has
  grown in importance with the years, and has now come to absorb the whole
  energy of my life. I cannot, however, close these scattered memories of my
  adventures in thought and action without some reference, however incomplete
  to that which has been far the most important thing in my life. It is the
  thing for which every preceding phase, my gradual religious development, my
  books, which gave me an introduction to the public, my modest fortune, which
  enables me to devote myself to unlucrative work, my platform work, which
  helps me to convey the message, and my physical strength, which is still
  sufficient to stand arduous tours and to fill the largest halls for an hour
  and a half with my voice, have each and all been an unconscious preparation.
  For thirty years I have trained myself exactly for the rôle without the least
  inward suspicion of whither I was tending.</p>

  <p>I cannot in the limited space of a chapter go into very lengthy detail or
  complete argument upon the subject. It is the more unnecessary since I have
  already in my psychic volumes outlined very clearly how I arrived at my
  present knowledge. Of these volumes the first and second, called respectively
  "The New Revelation" and "The Vital Message," show how gradual evidence was
  given me of the continuation of life, and how thorough and long were my
  studies before I was at last beaten out of my material agnostic position and
  forced to admit the validity of the proofs.</p>

  <p>In the days of universal sorrow and loss, when the voice of Rachel was
  heard throughout the land, it was borne in upon me that the knowledge which
  had come to me thus was not for my own consolation alone, but that God had
  placed me in a very special position for conveying it to that world which
  needed it so badly.</p>

  <p>I found in the movement many men who saw the truth as clearly as I did;
  but such was the clamour of the "religious," who were opposing that which is
  the very essence of living religion, of the "scientific," who broke the first
  laws of Science by pronouncing upon a thing which they had not examined, and
  of the Press, who held up every real or imaginary rascality as being typical
  of a movement which they had never understood, that the true men were abashed
  and shrank from the public exposition of their views. It was to combat this
  that I began a campaign in 1916 which can only finish when all is
  finished.</p>

  <p>One grand help I had. My wife had always been averse from my psychic
  studies, deeming the subject to be uncanny and dangerous. Her own experiences
  soon convinced her to the contrary, for her brother, who was killed at Mons,
  came back to us in a very convincing way. From that instant she threw herself
  with all the whole-hearted energy of her generous nature into the work which
  lay before us.</p>

  <p>A devoted mother, she was forced often to leave her children; a lover of
  home, she was compelled to quit it for many months at a time; distrustful of
  the sea, she joyfully shared my voyages. We have now travelled a good 50,000
  miles upon our quest. We have spoken face to face with a quarter of a million
  of people. Her social qualities, her clear sanity, her ardent charity, and
  her gracious presence upon the platforms all united with her private counsel
  and sympathy, have been such an aid to me that they have turned my work into
  a joy. The presence of our dear children upon our journeys has also lightened
  them for both of us.</p>

  <p>I began our public expositions of the subject by three years of
  intermittent lecturing in this country, during which period I visited nearly
  every town of importance, many of them twice and thrice. Everywhere I found
  attentive audiences, critical, as they should be, but open to conviction. I
  roused antagonism only in those who had not heard me, and there were
  demonstrations outside the doors, but never in the halls. I cannot remember a
  single interruption during that long series of addresses. It was interesting
  to notice how I was upheld, for though I was frequently very weary before the
  address, and though my war lectures had often been attended by palpitation of
  the heart, I was never once conscious of any fatigue during or after a
  lecture upon psychic subjects.</p>

  <p>On August 13, 1920, we started for Australia. In proportion to her
  population she had lost almost as heavily as we during the war, and I felt
  that my seed would fall upon fruitful ground. I have written all details of
  this episode in my "Wanderings of a Spiritualist," in which the reader will
  find among other things some evidences of that preternatural help which went
  with us in our journeys. I addressed large audiences in all the big towns of
  Australia and New Zealand An unfortunate shipping strike prevented me from
  reaching Tasmania, but otherwise the venture was an unalloyed success.
  Contrary to expectation I was able to pay all the expenses of our large party
  (we were seven) and to leave a balance behind me to help the successor whom I
  might choose.</p>

  <p>At the end of March, 1921, we were back in Paris again, where, greatly
  daring, I lectured in French upon psychic subjects. Our stay at home was not
  a very long one, for urgent invitations had come from America, where the
  Spiritual movement had fallen into a somewhat languishing state. On April 1,
  1922 our whole party started for the States. What happened to us I have
  recorded in "Our American Adventure." Suffice it to say that the trip was
  very successful, and that from Boston to Washington, and from New York to
  Chicago, I spoke in all the larger cities and brought about a great revival
  of interest in the subject. We were back in England at the beginning of July
  1922.</p>

  <p>I was by no means satisfied about America, however, as we had not touched
  the great West, the land of the future. Therefore we set forth again in March
  1923, getting back in August. Our adventures, which were remarkable upon the
  psychic side, are recorded in "Our Second American Adventure." When I
  returned from that journey I had travelled 55,000 miles in three years, and
  spoken to quarter of a million of people. I am still unsatisfied, however,
  for the Southern States of the Union have not been touched, and it is
  possible that we may yet make a journey in that direction.</p>

  <p>I have placed on record our experiences, and no doubt they have little
  interest at the moment for the general public, but the day will come, and
  that speedily, when people will understand that this proposition for which we
  are now fighting is far the most important thing for two thousand years in
  the history of the world, and when the efforts of the pioneers will have a
  very real interest to all who have sufficient intelligence to follow the
  progress of human thought.</p>

  <p>I am only one of many working for the cause, but I hope that I may claim
  that I brought into it a combative and aggressive spirit which it lacked
  before, and which has now so forced it upon public attention that one can
  hardly pick up a paper without reading some comment upon it. If some of these
  papers are hopelessly ignorant and prejudiced, it is not a bad thing for the
  cause. If you have a bad case, constant publicity is a misfortune, but if you
  have a good one, its goodness will always assert itself, however much it may
  be misrepresented.</p>

  <p>Many Spiritualists have taken the view that since we know these comforting
  and wonderful things, and since the world chooses not to examine the
  evidence, we may be content with our own happy assurance. This seems to me an
  immoral view.</p>

  <p>If God has sent a great new message of exceeding joy down to earth, then
  it is for us, to whom it has been clearly revealed, to pass it on at any cost
  of time, money and labour. It is not given to us for selfish enjoyment, but
  for general consolation. If the sick man turns from the physician, then it
  cannot be helped, but at least the healing draught should be offered.</p>

  <p>The greater the difficulty in breaking down the wall of apathy, ignorance
  and materialism, the more is it a challenge to our manhood to attack and ever
  attack in the same bulldog spirit with which Foch faced the German lines.</p>

  <p>I trust that the record of my previous life will assure the reader that I
  have within my limitations preserved a sane and balanced judgment, since I
  have never hitherto been extreme in my views, and since what I have said has
  so often been endorsed by the actual course of events. But never have I said
  anything with the same certainty of conviction with which I now say that this
  new knowledge is going to sweep the earth and to revolutionize human views
  upon every topic save only on fundamental morality, which is a fixed
  thing.</p>

  <p>All modern inventions and discoveries will sink into insignificance beside
  those psychic facts which will force themselves within a few years upon the
  universal human mind.</p>

  <p>The subject has been obscured by the introduction of all sorts of side
  issues, some of interest but not vital, others quite irrelevant. There is a
  class of investigator who loves to wander round in a circle, and to drag you
  with him if you are weak enough to accept such guidance. He trips continually
  over his own brains, and can never persuade himself that the simple and
  obvious explanation is also the true one. His intellect becomes a positive
  curse to him, for he uses it to avoid the straight road and to fashion out
  some strange devious path which lands him at last in a quagmire, whilst the
  direct and honest mind has kept firmly to the highway of knowledge. When I
  meet men of this type, and then come in contact with the lowly congregations
  of religious Spiritualists, I think always of Christ's words when He thanked
  God that He had revealed these things to babes and withheld them from the
  wise and the prudent. I think also of a dictum of Baron Reichenbach: "There
  is a scientific incredulity which exceeds in stupidity the obtuseness of the
  clodhopper."</p>

  <p>But what I say in no way applies to the reasonable researcher whose
  experiences are real stepping-stones leading to his fixed conclusion. There
  must to every man be this novitiate in knowledge. The matter is too serious
  to be taken without due intellectual conviction.</p>

  <p>It must not be imagined that I entirely deny the existence of fraud. But
  it is far less common than is supposed, and as for its being universal, which
  is the theory of the conjurers and some other critics, such an opinion is
  beyond reason or argument. In an experience with mediums which has been
  excelled by very few living men, and which has embraced three continents, I
  have not encountered fraud more than three or four times.</p>

  <p>There is conscious and unconscious fraud, and it is the existence of the
  latter which complicates the question so badly. Conscious fraud usually
  arises from a temporary failure of real psychic power, and a consequent
  attempt to replace it by an imitation. Unconscious fraud comes in that
  curious half-way state which I have called the "half-trance condition" when
  the medium seems normal, and yet is actually hardly responsible for his
  actions.</p>

  <p>At such a time the process by which his personality leaves his body seems
  to have set in, and his higher qualities have already passed, so that he can
  apparently no longer inhibit the promptings received from the suggestion of
  those around him, or from his own unchecked desires. Thus one will find
  mediums doing stupid and obvious things which expose them to the charge of
  cheating. Then if the observer disregards these and waits, the true psychic
  phenomena of unmistakable character will follow as he sinks more deeply into
  trance.</p>

  <p>This was, I gather, noticeable in the case of Eusapia Paladino, but I have
  seen it with several others. In those cases where a medium has left the
  cabinet, and is found wandering about among the sitters, as has happened with
  Mrs. Corner, with Madame d'Esperance, and with Craddock&mdash;all of them
  mediums who have given many proofs of their real powers&mdash;I am convinced
  that the very natural supposition that they are fraudulent is really quite a
  mistaken one.</p>

  <p>When, on the other hand, it is found that the medium has introduced false
  drapery or accessories, which has sometimes occurred, we are in the presence
  of the most odious and blasphemous crime which a human being can commit.</p>

  <p>People ask me, not unnaturally, what is it which makes me so perfectly
  certain that this thing is true. That I am perfectly certain is surely
  demonstrated by the mere fact that I have abandoned my congenial and
  lucrative work, left my home for long periods at a time, and subjected myself
  to all sorts of inconveniences, losses, and even insults, in order to get the
  facts home to the people.</p>

  <p>To give all my reasons would be to write a book rather than a chapter, but
  I may say briefly that there is no physical sense which I possess which has
  not been separately assured, and that there is no conceivable method by which
  a spirit could show its presence which I have not on many occasions
  experienced. In the presence of Miss Besinnet as medium and of several
  witnesses I have seen my mother and my nephew, young Oscar Hornung, as
  plainly as ever I saw them in life&mdash;so plainly that I could almost have
  counted the wrinkles of the one and the freckles of the other.</p>

  <p>In the darkness the face of my mother shone up, peaceful, happy, slightly
  inclined to one side, the eyes closed. My wife upon my right and the lady
  upon my left both saw it as clearly as I did. The lady had not known my
  mother in life but she said, "How wonderfully like she is to her son," which
  will show how clear was the detail of the features.</p>

  <p>On another occasion my son came back to me. Six persons heard his
  conversation with me, and signed a paper afterwards to that effect. It was in
  his voice and concerned itself with what was unknown to the medium, who was
  bound and breathing deeply in his chair. If the evidence of six persons of
  standing and honour may not be taken, then how can any human fact be
  established?</p>

  <p>My brother, General Doyle, came back with the same medium, but on another
  occasion. He discussed the health of his widow. She was a Danish lady, and he
  wanted her to use a masseur in Copenhagen. He gave the name I made inquiries
  and found that such a man did exist. Whence came this knowledge? Who was it
  who took so close an interest in the health of this lady? If it was not her
  dead husband then who was it?</p>

  <p>All fine-drawn theories of the subconscious go to pieces before the plain
  statement of the intelligence, "I am a spirit. I am Innes. I am your
  brother." I have clasped materialized hands.</p>

  <p>I have held long conversations with the direct voice.</p>

  <p>I have smelt the peculiar ozone-like smell of ectoplasm.</p>

  <p>I have listened to prophecies which were quickly fulfilled.</p>

  <p>I have seen the "dead" glimmer up upon a photographic plate which no hand
  but mine had touched.</p>

  <p>I have received through the hand of my own wife, notebooks full of
  information which was utterly beyond her ken.</p>

  <p>I have seen heavy articles swimming in the air, untouched by human hand,
  and obeying directions given to unseen operators.</p>

  <p>I have seen spirits walk round the room in fair light and join in the talk
  of the company.</p>

  <p>I have known an untrained woman possessed by an artist spirit, and rapidly
  produce a picture now hanging in my drawing-room which few living painters
  could have bettered.</p>

  <p>I have read books which might have come from great thinkers and scholars,
  and which were actually written by unlettered men who acted as the medium of
  the unseen intelligence, so superior to his own. I have recognized the style
  of a dead writer which no parodist could have copied, and which was written
  in his own handwriting.</p>

  <p>I have heard singing beyond earthly power, and whistling done with no
  pause for the intake of breath.</p>

  <p>I have seen objects from a distance projected into a room with closed
  doors and windows.</p>

  <p>If a man could see, hear, and feel all this, and yet remain unconvinced of
  unseen intelligent forces around him, he would have good cause to doubt his
  own sanity. Why should he heed the chatter of irresponsible journalists, or
  the head-shaking of inexperienced men of science, when he has himself had so
  many proofs? They are babies in this matter, and should be sitting at his
  feet.</p>

  <p>It is not, however, a question to be argued in a detached and impersonal
  way, as if one were talking of the Baconian theory or the existence of
  Atlantis. It is intimate, personal, and vital to the last degree.</p>

  <p>A closed mind means an earthbound soul, and that in turn means future
  darkness and misery. If you know what is coming, you can avoid it. If you do
  not, you run grave risk. Some Jeremiah or Savonarola is needed who will
  shriek this into the ears of the world. A new conception of sin is needed.
  The mere carnal frailties of humanity, the weaknesses of the body, are not to
  be lightly condoned, but are not the serious part of the human reckoning. It
  is the fixed condition of mind, narrowness, bigotry, materialism&mdash;in a
  word, the sins not of the body, but of the spirit, which are the real
  permanent things, and condemn the individual to the lower spheres until he
  has learnt his lesson.</p>

  <p>We know this from our rescue circles when these poor souls come back to
  bewail their errors and to learn those truths which they might have learnt
  here, had their minds not been closed by apathy or prejudice.</p>

  <p>The radical mistake which science has made in investigating the subject is
  that it has never troubled to grasp the fact that it is not the medium who is
  producing the phenomena. It has always treated him as if he were a conjurer,
  and said, "Do this or do that," failing to understand that little or nothing
  comes <i>from</i> him, but all or nearly all comes <i>through</i> him. I say
  "nearly" all, for I believe that some simple phenomena, such as the rap, can
  within limits be produced by the medium's own will.</p>

  <p>It is this false view of science which has prevented sceptics from
  realizing that a gentle and receptive state of mind on the part of sitters
  and an easy natural atmosphere for the medium are absolutely essential in
  order to produce harmony with the outside forces.</p>

  <p>If in the greatest of all séances, that of the upper room on the day of
  Pentecost, an aggressive sceptic had insisted upon test conditions of his own
  foolish devising, where would the rushing wind and the tongues of fire have
  been? "All with one accord," says the writer of the Acts of the Apostles, and
  that is the essential condition. I have sat with saintly people, and I too
  have felt the rushing wind, seen the flickering tongues and heard the great
  voice, but how could such results come where harmony did not reign?</p>

  <p>That is the radical mistake which science has made. Men know well that
  even in her own coarse, material work the presence of a scrap of metal may
  upset the whole balance of a great magnetic installation, and yet they will
  not take the word of those who are in a position to speak from experience
  that a psychic condition may upset a psychic experiment.</p>

  <p>But indeed when we speak of science in this connection it is a confusion
  of thought. The fact that a man is a great zoologist like Lankester, or a
  great physicist like Tyndall or Faraday, does not give his opinion any weight
  in a subject which is outside his own specialty. There is many an unknown
  Smith and Jones whose twenty years of practical work have put him in a far
  stronger position than that of these intolerant scientists; while as to the
  real Spiritualist leaders, men of many experiences and much reading and
  thought, it is they who are the real scientific experts who are in a position
  to teach the world. One does not lose one's judgment when one becomes a
  Spiritualist. One is as much a researcher as ever, but one understands better
  what it is that one is studying and how to study it.</p>

  <p>This controversy with bumptious and ignorant people is a mere passing
  thing which matters nothing. The real controversy, which does matter very
  much, is with the Continental school who study ectoplasm and other
  semi-material manifestations, but who have not got the length of seeing
  independent spirit behind them. Richet, Schrenek-Notzing and other great
  investigators are still in this midway position, and Flammarion is little
  more advanced. Richet goes the length of admitting that he has assured
  himself by personal observation of the materialized form that it can walk and
  talk and leave moulds of its hands. So far he has gone. And yet even now he
  clings to the idea that these phenomena may be the externalization of some
  latent powers of the human body and mind.</p>

  <p>Such an explanation seems to me to be the desperate defence of the last
  trench by one of those old-time materialists, who say with Brewster: "Spirit
  is the last thing which we will concede," adding as their reason "it upsets
  the work of fifty years." It is hard when a man has taught all his life that
  the brain governs spirit to have to learn after all that it may be spirit
  which acts independently of the human brain. But it is their
  super-materialism which is the real difficulty with which we now have to
  contend.</p>

  <p>And what is the end of it all?</p>

  <p>I have no idea. How could those who first noted the electric twitching of
  muscles foresee the Atlantic cable or the arc lamp? Our information is that
  some great shock is coming shortly to the human race which will finally break
  down its apathy, and which will be accompanied by such psychic signs that the
  survivors will be unable any longer to deny the truths which we preach.</p>

  <p>The real meaning of our movement will then be seen, for it will become
  apparent that we have accustomed the public mind to such ideas, and provided
  a body of definite teaching, both scientific and religious, to which they can
  turn for guidance.</p>

  <p>As to the prophecy of disaster, I admit that we have to be on our guard.
  Even the Christ circle was woefully deceived, and declared confidently that
  the world would not survive their own generation. Various creeds, too, have
  made vain predictions of the end of the world.</p>

  <p>I am keenly aware of all this, and also of the difficulty in reckoning
  time when seen from the other side. But, making every allowance for this, the
  information upon the point has been so detailed, and has reached me from so
  many entirely independent sources, that I have been forced to take it
  seriously, and to think that some great watershed of human experience may be
  passed within a few years&mdash;the greatest, we are told, that our
  long-suffering race has yet encountered.</p>

  <p>People who have not gone into the subject may well ask, "But what do you
  get out of it? How are you the better?" We can only answer that all life has
  changed to us since this definite knowledge has come. No longer are we shut
  in by death. We are out of the valley and up on the ridge, with vast clear
  vistas before us.</p>

  <p>Why should we fear a death which we know for certain is the doorway to
  unutterable happiness?</p>

  <p>Why should we fear our dear ones' death if we can be so near to them
  afterwards?</p>

  <p>Am I not far nearer to my son than if he were alive and serving in that
  Army Medical Service which would have taken him to the ends of the earth?
  There is never a month, often never a week, that I do not commune with him Is
  it not evident that such facts as these change the whole aspect of life, and
  turn the grey mist of dissolution into a rosy dawn?</p>

  <p>You may say that we have already all these assurances in the Christian
  revelation. It is true, and that is why we are not anti-Christian so long as
  Christianity is the teaching of humble Christ and not of his arrogant
  representatives.</p>

  <p>Every form of Christianity is represented in our ranks, often by clergymen
  of the various denominations. But there is nothing precise in the definitions
  of the other world as given in the holy writings. The information we have
  depicts a heaven of congenial work and of congenial play, with every mental
  and physical activity of life carried on to a higher plane&mdash;a heaven of
  art, of science, of intellect, of organization, of combat with evil, of home
  circles, of flowers, of wide travel, of sports, of the mating of souls, of
  complete harmony. This is what our "dead" friends describe.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, we hear from them, and sometimes directly, of the
  hells, which are temporary spheres of purification. We hear of the mists, the
  darkness, the aimless wanderings, the mental confusion, the remorse.</p>

  <p>"Our condition is horrible," wrote one of them to me recently at a séance.
  These things are real and vivid and provable to us. That is why we are an
  enormous force for the resuscitation of true religion, and why the clergy
  take a heavy responsibility when they oppose us.</p>

  <p>The final result upon scientific thought is unthinkable, save that the
  sources of all force would be traced rather to spiritual than to material
  causes.</p>

  <p>In religion one can perhaps see a little more clearly. Theology and dogma
  would disappear.</p>

  <p>People would realize that such questions as the number of persons in God,
  or the process of Christ's birth, have no bearing at all upon the development
  of man's spirit, which is the sole object of life.</p>

  <p>All religions would be equal, for all alike produce gentle, unselfish
  souls who are God's elect. Christian, Jew, Buddhist, and Mohammedan would
  shed their distinctive doctrines, follow their own high teachers on a common
  path of morality, and forget all that antagonism which has made religion a
  curse rather than a blessing to the world.</p>

  <p>We shall be in close touch with other-world forces, and knowledge will
  supersede that faith which has in the past planted a dozen different
  signposts to point in as many different directions.</p>

  <p>Such will be the future, so far as I can dimly see it, and all this will
  spring from the seed which now we tend and water amid the cold blasts of a
  hostile world.</p>

  <p>Do not let it be thought that I claim any special leadership in this
  movement. I do what I can, but many others have done what they
  could&mdash;many humble workers who have endured loss and insult, but who
  will come to be recognized as the modern Apostles. For my part, I can only
  claim that I have been an instrument so fashioned that I have had some
  particular advantages in getting this teaching across to the people.</p>

  <p>That is the work which will occupy, either by voice or pen, the remainder
  of my life. What immediate shape it will take I cannot say. Human plans are
  vain things, and it is better for the tool to lie passive until the great
  hand moves it once more.</p>
