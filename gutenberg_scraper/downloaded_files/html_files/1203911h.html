  <h2><a id="pre"
     name="pre">PREFACE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The narrative, now for the first time presented to the
  world, was written by the Sieur de Rohaine to while away the time during the
  long period and painful captivity, borne with heroic resolution, which
  preceded his death. He chose the English tongue, in which he was
  extraordinarily proficient, for two reasons: first, as an exercise in the
  language; second, because he desired to keep the passages here recorded from
  the knowledge of certain of his kinsfolk in France. Few changes have been
  made in his work. Now and then an English idiom has been substituted for a
  French; certain tortuous expressions have been emended; and in general the
  portions in the Scots dialect have been rewritten, since the author&rsquo;s
  knowledge of this manner of speech seems scarcely to have been so great as he
  himself thought.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I.&mdash;ON THE HIGH MOORS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Before me stretched a black heath, over which the mist blew
  in gusts, and through whose midst the road crept like an adder. Great
  storm-marked hills flanked me on either side, and since I set out I had seen
  their harsh outline against a thick sky, until I longed for flat ground to
  rest my sight upon. The way was damp, and the soft mountain gravel sank under
  my horse&rsquo;s feet; and ever and anon my legs were splashed by the water
  from some pool which the rain had left. Shrill mountain birds flew around,
  and sent their cries through the cold air. Sometimes the fog would lift for a
  moment from the face of the land and show me a hilltop or the leaden glimmer
  of a loch, but nothing more&mdash;≠no green field or homestead; only a barren
  and accursed desert.</p>

  <p>Neither horse nor man was in any spirit. My back ached, and I shivered in
  my sodden garments, while my eyes were dim from gazing on flying clouds. The
  poor beast stumbled often, for he had traveled far on little fodder, and a
  hill-road was a new thing in his experience. Saladin I called him&mdash;≠for
  I had fancied that there was something Turkish about his black face, with the
  heavy turban-like band above his forehead&mdash;≠in my old fortunate days
  when I bought him. He was a fine horse of the Normandy breed, and had carried
  me on many a wild journey, though on none so forlorn as this.</p>

  <p>But to speak of myself. I am Jean de Rohaine, at your service; Sieur de
  Rohaine in the province of Touraine&mdash;≠a gentleman, I trust, though one
  in a sorry plight. And how I came to be in the wild highlands of the place
  called Galloway, in the bare kingdom of Scotland, I must haste to tell. In
  the old days, when I had lived as became my rank in my native land, I had met
  a Scot,&mdash;≠one Kennedy by name,&mdash;≠a great man in his own country,
  with whom I struck up an intimate friendship. He and I were as brothers, and
  he swore that if I came to visit him in his own home he would see to it that
  I should have the best. I thanked him at the time for his bidding, but
  thought little more of it.</p>

  <p>Now, by ill fortune, the time came when, what with gaming and pleasuring,
  I was a beggared man, and I bethought me of the Scot&rsquo;s offer. I had
  liked the man well, and I considered how it would be no ill thing to abide in
  that country till I should find some means of bettering my affairs. So I took
  ship and came to the town of Ayr, from which &rsquo;twas but a day&rsquo;s
  ride to the house of my friend. &rsquo;Twas in midsummer when I landed, and
  the place looked not so bare as I had feared, as I rode along between green
  meadows to my destination. There I found Quentin Kennedy, somewhat grown old
  and more full in flesh than I remembered him in the past. He had been a tall,
  black-avised man when I first knew him; now he was grizzled,&mdash;≠whether
  from hard living or the harshness of northern weather I know not,&mdash;≠and
  heavier than a man of action is wont to be. He greeted me most hospitably,
  putting his house at my bidding, and swearing that I should abide and keep
  him company and go no more back to the South.</p>

  <p>So for near a month I stayed there, and such a time of riot and hilarity I
  scarce remember. <i>Mon Dieu</i>, but the feasting and the sporting would
  have rejoiced the hearts of my comrades of the Rue Margot! I had already
  learned much of the Scots tongue at the college in Paris, where every second
  man hails from this land, and now I was soon perfect in it, speaking it all
  but as well as my host. &rsquo;Tis a gift I have, for I well remember how,
  when I consorted for some months in the low countries with an Italian of
  Milan, I picked up a fair knowledge of his speech. So now I found myself in
  the midst of men of spirit, and a rare life we led. The gentlemen of the
  place would come much about the house, and I promise you &rsquo;twas not
  seldom we saw the morning in as we sat at wine. There was, too, the greatest
  sport at coursing and hunting the deer in Kennedy&rsquo;s lands by the Water
  of Doon.</p>

  <p>Yet there was that I liked not among the fellows who came thither, nay,
  even in my friend himself. We have a proverb in France that the devil when he
  spoils a German in the making turns him into a Scot, and for certain there
  was much boorishness among them, which to my mind sits ill on gentlemen. They
  would jest at one another till I thought that in a twinkling swords would be
  out, and lo! I soon found that &rsquo;twas but done for sport, and with no
  evil intent. They were clownish in their understanding, little recking of the
  feelings of a man of honor, but quick to grow fierce on some tittle of
  provocation which another would scarce notice. Indeed, &rsquo;tis my belief
  that one of this nation is best in his youth, for Kennedy, whom I well
  remembered as a man of courage and breeding, had grown grosser and more
  sottish with his years, till I was fain to ask where was my friend of the
  past.</p>

  <p>And now I come to that which brought on my departure and my misfortunes.
  &rsquo;Twas one night as I returned weary from riding after a stag in the
  haugh by the river, that Quentin cried hastily, as I entered, that now he had
  found something worthy of my attention.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow, Jock,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you will see sport. There
  has been some cursed commotion among the folk of the hills, and I am out the
  morrow to redd the marches. You shall have a troop of horse and ride with me,
  and, God&rsquo;s death, we will have a taste of better work!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I cried out that I could have asked for naught better, and, indeed, I was
  overjoyed that the hard drinking and idleness were at an end, and that the
  rigors of warfare lay before me. For I am a soldier by birth and by
  profession, and I love the jingle of steel and the rush of battle.</p>

  <p>So, on the morrow, I rode to the mountains with a score of dragoons behind
  me, glad and hopeful. <i>Diable!</i> How shall I tell my disappointment? The
  first day I had seen all&mdash;≠and more than I wished. We fought, not with
  men like ourselves, but with women and children and unarmed yokels, and
  butchered like Cossacks more than Christians. I grew sick of the work, and
  would have none of it, but led my men to the rendezvous sullenly, and hot at
  heart. &rsquo;Twas well the night was late when we arrived, else I should
  have met with Kennedy there and then, and God knows what might have
  happened.</p>

  <p>The next day, in a great fit of loathing, I followed my host again, hoping
  that the worst was over, and that henceforth I should have something more to
  my stomach. But little I knew of the men with whom I journeyed. There was a
  cottage there, a shepherd&rsquo;s house, and God! they burned it down, and
  the man they shot before his wife and children, speaking naught to him but
  foul-mouthed reproaches and jabber about some creed which was strange to me.
  I could not prevent it, though &rsquo;twas all that I could do to keep myself
  from a mad attack.</p>

  <p>I rode up to Quentin Kennedy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I have had great kindness at your hands,
  but you and I must part. I see that we are made of different stuff. I can
  endure war, but not massacre.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed at my scruples, incredulous of my purpose, until at last he saw
  that I was fixed in my determination. Then he spoke half kindly:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is a small matter to stand between me and thee. I am a servant
  of the king, and but do my duty. I little thought to have disloyalty preached
  from your lips; but bide with me, and I promise that you shall see no more of
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But my anger was too great, and I would have none of him. Then&mdash;≠and
  now I marvel at the man&rsquo;s forbearance&mdash;≠he offered me money to
  recompense me for my trouble. &rsquo;Twas honestly meant, and oft have I
  regretted my action, but to me in my fury it seemed but an added insult.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said I angrily; &ldquo;I take no payment from butchers.
  I am a gentleman, if a poor one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this he flushed wrathfully, and I thought for an instant that he would
  have drawn on me; but he refrained, and I rode off alone among the moors. I
  knew naught of the land, and I must have taken the wrong way, for noon found
  me hopelessly mazed among a tangle of rocks and hills and peat-mosses.
  Verily, Quentin Kennedy had taken the best revenge by suffering me to follow
  my own leading.</p>

  <p>In the early hours of my journey my head was in such a whirl of wrath and
  dismay, that I had little power to think settled thoughts. I was in a
  desperate confusion, half angry at my own haste, and half bitter at the
  coldness of a friend who would permit a stranger to ride off alone with
  scarce a word of regret. When I have thought the matter out in after days, I
  have been as perplexed as ever; yet it still seems to me, though I know not
  how, that I acted as any man of honor and heart would approve. Still this
  thought was little present to me in my discomfort, as I plashed through the
  sodden turf.</p>

  <p>I had breakfasted at Kennedy&rsquo;s house of Dunpeel in the early
  morning, and since I had no provision of any sort with me, &rsquo;twas not
  long ere the biting of hunger began to set in. My race is a hardy stock, used
  to much hardships and rough fare, but in this inclement land my heart failed
  me wholly, and I grew sick and giddy, what with the famishing and the cold
  rain. For, though &rsquo;twas late August, the month of harvest and
  fruit-time in my own fair land, it seemed more like winter. The gusts of
  sharp wind came driving out of the mist and pierced me to the very marrow. So
  chill were they that my garments were of no avail to avert them; being,
  indeed, of the thinnest, and cut according to the fashion of fine cloth for
  summer wear at the shows and gallantries of the town. A pretty change,
  thought I, from the gardens of Versailles and the trim streets of Paris to
  this surly land; and sad it was to see my cloak, meant for no rougher breeze
  than the gentle south, tossed and scattered by a grim wind.</p>

  <p>I have marked it often, and here I proved its truth, that man&rsquo;s
  thoughts turn always to the opposites of his present state. Here was I, set
  in the most uncharitable land on earth; and yet ever before my eyes would
  come brief visions of the gay country which I had forsaken. In a gap of hill
  I fancied that I descried a level distance with sunny vineyards and rich
  orchards, to which I must surely come if I but hastened. When I stooped to
  drink at a stream, I fancied ere I drank it that the water would taste like
  the Bordeaux I was wont to drink at the little hostelry in the Rue Margot;
  and when the tasteless liquid once entered my mouth, the disenchantment was
  severe. I met one peasant, an old man bent with toil, coarse-featured, yet
  not without some gleams of kindness, and I could not refrain from addressing
  him in my native tongue. For though I could make some shape at his barbarous
  patois, in my present distress it came but uneasily from my lips. He stared
  at me stupidly, and when I repeated the question in the English, he made some
  unintelligible reply, and stumbled onward in his way. I watched his poor
  figure as he walked. Such, thought I, are the <i>canaille</i> of the land,
  and &rsquo;tis little wonder if their bodies be misshapen, and their minds
  dull, for an archangel would become a boor if he dwelt here for any space of
  time.</p>

  <p>But enough of such dreams, and God knows no man had ever less cause for
  dreaming. Where was I to go, and what might my purpose be in this wilderness
  which men call the world? An empty belly and a wet skin do not tend to sedate
  thinking, so small wonder if I saw little ahead. I was making for the end of
  the earth, caring little in what direction, weary and sick of heart, with
  sharp anger at the past, and never a hope for the morrow.</p>

  <p>Yet, even in my direst days, I have ever found some grain of expectation
  to console me. I had five crowns in my purse; little enough, but sufficient
  to win me a dinner and a bed at some cheap hostelry. So all through the gray
  afternoon I looked sharply for a house, mistaking every monstrous bowlder for
  a gable-end. I cheered my heart with thinking of dainties to be looked for; a
  dish of boiled fish, or a piece of mutton from one of the wild-faced sheep
  which bounded ever and anon across my path. Nay, I was in no mood to be
  fastidious. I would e&rsquo;en be content with a poor fare, provided always I
  could succeed in swallowing it, for my desire soon became less for the
  attainment of a pleasure than for the alleviation of a discomfort. For I was
  ravenous as a hawk, and had it in my heart more than once to dismount, and
  seek for the sparse hill-berries.</p>

  <p>And, indeed, this was like to have been my predicament, for the day grew
  late and I came no nearer a human dwelling. The valley in which I rode grew
  wider, about to open, as I thought, into the dale of a river. The hills, from
  rising steeply by the wayside, were withdrawn to the distance of maybe a
  mile, where they lifted their faces through the network of the mist. All the
  land between them, save a strip where the road lay, was filled with a black
  marsh, where moor birds made a most dreary wailing. It minded me of the cries
  of the innocents whom King Herod slew, as I had seen the dead represented
  outside the village church of Rohaine in my far-away homeland. My heart grew
  sore with longing. I had bartered my native country for the most dismal on
  earth, and all for nothing. Madman that I was, were it not better to be a
  beggar in France than a horse-captain in any other place? I cursed my folly
  sorely, as each fresh blast sent a shiver through my body. Nor was my horse
  in any better state&mdash;≠Saladin, whom I had seen gayly decked at a
  procession with ribbons and pretty favors, who had carried me so often and so
  far, who had always fared on the best. The poor beast was in a woeful plight,
  with his pasterns bleeding from the rough stones and his head bent with
  weariness. Verily, I pitied him more than myself, and if I had had a crust we
  should have shared it.</p>

  <p>The night came in, black as a draw-well and stormy as the Day of Doom. I
  had now no little trouble in picking out the way from among the treacherous
  morasses. Of a sudden my horse would have a forefoot in a pool of black
  peat-water, from which I would scarce, by much pulling, recover him. A sharp
  jag of stone in the way would all but bring him to his knees. So we dragged
  wearifully along, scarce fearing, caring, hoping for anything in this world
  or another.</p>

  <p>It was, I judge, an hour after nightfall, about nine of the clock, when I
  fancied that some glimmer shot through the thick darkness. I could have
  clapped my hands for joy had I been able; but alas! these were so stiff, that
  clapping was as far from me as from a man with the palsy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Courage!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;courage, Saladin! There is yet hope
  for us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The poor animal seemed to share in my expectations. He carried me quicker
  forward, so that soon the feeble gleam had grown to a broad light. Inn or
  dwelling, thought I, there I stay, for I will go not a foot further for man
  or devil. My sword must e&rsquo;en be my <i>fourrier</i> to get me a
  night&rsquo;s lodging. Then I saw the house, a low, dark place, unillumined
  save for that front window which shone as an invitation to travelers. In a
  minute I was at the threshold. There, in truth, was the sign flapping above
  the lintel. &rsquo;Twas an inn at length, and my heart leaped out in
  gratitude.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">II.&mdash;I FARE BADLY INDOORS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I dropped wearily from my horse and stumbled forward to the
  door. &rsquo;Twas close shut, but rays of light came through the chinks at
  the foot, and the great light in the further window lit up the ground for
  some yards. I knocked loudly with my sword-hilt. Stillness seemed to reign
  within, save that from some distant room a faint sound of men&rsquo;s voices
  was brought. A most savory smell stole out to the raw air and revived my
  hunger with hopes of supper.</p>

  <p>Again I knocked, this time rudely, and the door rattled on its hinges.
  This brought some signs of life from within. I could hear a foot on the stone
  floor of a passage, a bustling as of many folk running hither and thither,
  and a great barking of a sheep-dog. Of a sudden the door was flung open, a
  warm blaze of light rushed forth, and I stood blinking before the master of
  the house.</p>

  <p>He was a tall, grizzled man of maybe fifty years, thin, with a stoop in
  his back that all hill-folk have, and a face brown with sun and wind. I
  judged him fifty, but he may have been younger by ten years, for in that
  desert men age the speedier. His dress was dirty and ragged in many places,
  and in one hand he carried a pistol, which he held before him as if for
  protection. He stared at me for a second.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wha are ye that comes dirlin&rsquo; here on sic a nicht?&rdquo;
  said he, and I give his speech as I remember it. As he uttered the words, he
  looked me keenly in the face, and I felt his thin, cold glance piercing to
  the roots of my thoughts. I liked the man ill, for, what with his lean figure
  and sour countenance, he was far different from the jovial, well-groomed
  fellows who will give you greeting at any wayside inn from Calais to
  Bordeaux.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You ask a strange question, and one little needing answer. If a man
  has wandered for hours in bog-holes, he will be in no mind to stand
  chaffering at inn doors. I seek a night&rsquo;s lodging for my horse and
  myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s little we can give you, for it&rsquo;s a bare,
  sinfu&rsquo; land,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but such as I ha&rsquo;e
  ye&rsquo;re welcome to. Bide a minute, and I&rsquo;ll bring a licht to
  tak&rsquo; ye to the stable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was gone down the passage for a few seconds, and returned with a
  rushlight encased against the wind in a wicker covering. The storm made it
  flicker and flare till it sent dancing shadows over the dark walls of the
  house. The stable lay round by the back end, and thither poor Saladin and his
  master stumbled over a most villainous rough ground. The place, when found,
  was no great thing to boast of&mdash;≠a cold shed, damp with rain, with
  blaffs of wind wheezing through it; and I was grieved to think of my
  horse&rsquo;s nightly comfort. The host snatched from a rack a truss of hay,
  which by its smell was old enough, and tossed it into the manger.
  &ldquo;There ye are, and it&rsquo;s mair than mony a Christian gets in thae
  weary days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he led the way back into the house. We entered a draughty passage
  with a window at one end, broken in part, through which streamed the cold
  air. A turn brought me into a little square room, where a fire flickered and
  a low lamp burned on the table. &rsquo;Twas so home-like and peaceful that my
  heart went out to it, and I thanked my fate for the comfortable lodging I had
  chanced on. Mine host stirred the blaze and bade me strip off my wet
  garments. He fetched me an armful of rough homespuns, but I cared little to
  put them on, so I e&rsquo;en sat in my shirt and waited on the drying of my
  coat. My mother&rsquo;s portrait, the one by Grizot, which I have had set in
  gold and wear always near my heart, dangled to my lap, and I took this for an
  evil omen. I returned it quick to its place, the more so because I saw the
  landlord&rsquo;s lantern-jaw close at the sight, and his cold eyes twinkle.
  Had I been wise, too, I would have stripped my rings from my fingers ere I
  began this ill-boding travel, for it does not behoove a gentleman to be
  sojourning among beggars with gold about him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have ye come far the day?&rdquo; the man asked, in his harsh voice.
  &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re gey-like splashed wi&rsquo; dirt, so I jalouse ye cam ower
  the <i>Angel&rsquo;s Ladder</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Angel&rsquo;s ladder!&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;devil&rsquo;s ladder I
  call it! for a more blackguardly place I have not clapped eyes on since I
  first mounted horse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Angel&rsquo;s Ladder</i> they call it,&rdquo; said the man, to
  all appearance never heeding my words, &ldquo;for there, mony a year syne, an
  holy man of God, one Ebenezer Clavershaws, preached to a goodly gathering on
  the shining ladder seen by the patriarch Jacob at Bethel, which extended from
  earth to heaven. &rsquo;Twas a rich discourse, and I have it still in my
  mind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas more likely to have been a way to the Evil One for me.
  Had I but gone a further step many a time, I should have been giving my
  account ere this to my Maker. But a truce to this talk. &rsquo;Twas not to
  listen to such that I came here; let me have supper, the best you have, and a
  bottle of whatever wine you keep in this accursed place. Burgundy is my
  choice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; the fellow said gravely, looking at me with his
  unpleasing eyes, &ldquo;you are one who loves the meat that perisheth rather
  than the unsearchable riches of God&rsquo;s grace. Oh, be warned while yet
  there is time. You know not the delights of gladsome communion wi&rsquo; Him,
  which makes the moss-hags and heather-busses more fair than the roses of
  Sharon or the balmy plains of Gilead. Oh, be wise and turn, for now is the
  accepted time, now is the day of salvation!&rdquo;</p>

  <p><i>Sacr√©!</i> what madman have I fallen in with, thought I, who talks in
  this fashion. I had heard of the wild deeds of those in our own land who call
  themselves Huguenots, and I was not altogether without fear. But my appetite
  was keen, and my blood was never of the coolest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace with your nonsense, sirrah,&rdquo; I said sternly;
  &ldquo;what man are you who come and prate before your guests, instead of
  fetching their supper? Let me have mine at once, and no more of your
  Scripture.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As I spoke, I looked him angrily in the face, and my bearing must have had
  some effect upon him, for he turned suddenly and passed out.</p>

  <p>A wench appeared, a comely slip of a girl, with eyes somewhat dazed and
  timorous, and set the table with viands. There was a moor-fowl, well-roasted
  and tasty to the palate, a cut of salted beef, and for wine, a bottle of
  French claret of excellent quality. &rsquo;Twas so much in excess of my
  expectation, that I straightway fell into a good humor, and the black cloud
  of dismay lifted in some degree from my wits. I filled my glass and looked at
  it against the fire-glow, and dreamed that &rsquo;twas an emblem of the after
  course of my life. Who knew what fine things I might come to yet, though now
  I was solitary in a strange land?</p>

  <p>The landlord came in and took away the remnants himself. He looked at me
  fixedly more than once, and in his glance I read madness, greed, and hatred.
  I feared his look, and was glad to see him leave, for he made me feel angry
  and a little awed. However, thought I, &rsquo;tis not the first time I have
  met a churlish host, and I filled my glass again.</p>

  <p>The fire bickered cheerily, lighting up the room and comforting my cold
  skin. I drew my chair close and stretched out my legs to the blaze, till in a
  little, betwixt heat and weariness, I was pleasantly drowsy. I fell to
  thinking of the events of the day and the weary road I had traveled; then to
  an earlier time, when I first came to Scotland, and my hopes were still
  unbroken. After all this I began to mind me of the pleasant days in France;
  for, though I had often fared ill enough there, all was forgotten but the
  good fortune; and I had soon built out of my brain a France which was liker
  Paradise than anywhere on earth. Every now and then a log would crackle or
  fall, and so wake me with a start, for the fire was of that sort which is
  common in hilly places&mdash;≠a great bank of peat with wood laid athwart.
  Blue, pungent smoke came out in rings and clouds, which smelt gratefully in
  my nostrils after the black out-of-doors.</p>

  <p>By and by, what with thinking of the past, what with my present comfort,
  and what with an ever hopeful imagination, my prospects came to look less
  dismal. &rsquo;Twas true that I was here in a most unfriendly land with
  little money and no skill of the country. But Scotland was but a little
  place, after all. I must come to Leith in time, where I could surely meet a
  French skipper who would take me over, money or no. You will ask, whoever may
  chance to read this narrative, why, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, I did not turn
  and go back to Ayr, the port from which I had come? The reason is not far to
  seek. The whole land behind me stank in my nostrils, for there dwelt Quentin
  Kennedy, and there lay the scene of my discomfiture and my sufferings. Faugh!
  the smell of that wretched moor-road is with me yet. So, with thinking one
  way and another, I came to a decision to go forward in any case, and trust to
  God and my own good fortune. After this I must have ceased to have any
  thoughts, and dropped off snugly to sleep.</p>

  <p>I wakened, at what time I know not, shivering, with a black fire before my
  knees. The room was black with darkness, save where through a chink in the
  window-shutter there came a gleam of pale moonlight. I sprang up in haste and
  called for a servant to show me to my sleeping room, but the next second I
  could have wished the word back, for I feared that no servant would be awake
  and at hand. To my mind there seemed something passing strange in thus
  leaving a guest to slumber by the fire.</p>

  <p>To my amazement, the landlord himself came to my call, bearing a light in
  his hand. I was reasonably surprised, for though I knew not the hour of the
  night, I judged from the state of the fire that it must have been far
  advanced.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had fallen asleep,&rdquo; I said, in apology, &ldquo;and now
  would finish what I have begun. Show me my bed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a dark nicht and a coorse, out-bye,&rdquo; said the
  man, as he led the way solemnly from the room, up a rickety stair, down a
  mirk passage to a chamber which, from the turnings of the house, I guessed to
  be facing the east. &rsquo;Twas a comfortless place, and ere I could add a
  word I found the man leaving the room with the light. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
  find your way to bed in the dark,&rdquo; quoth he, and I was left in
  blackness.</p>

  <p>I sat down on the edge of the bed, half-stupid with sleep, my teeth
  chattering with the cold, listening to the gusts of wind battering against
  the little window. &rsquo;Faith! thought I, this is the worst entertainment I
  ever had, and I have made trial of many. Yet I need not complain, for I have
  had a good fire and a royal supper, and my present discomfort is due in great
  part to my own ill habit of drowsiness. I rose to undress, for my bones were
  sore after the long day&rsquo;s riding, when, by some chance, I moved forward
  to the window and opened it to look on the night.</p>

  <p>&rsquo;Twas wintry weather outside, though but the month of August. The
  face of the hills fronting me were swathed in white mist, which hung low even
  to the banks of the stream. There was a great muttering in the air of swollen
  water, for the rain had ceased, and the red waves were left to roll down the
  channel to the lowlands and make havoc of meadow and steading. The sky was
  cumbered with clouds, and no clear light of the moon came through; but since
  &rsquo;twas nigh the time of the full moon the night was not utterly
  dark.</p>

  <p>I lingered for maybe five minutes in this posture, and then I heard that
  which made me draw in my head and listen the more intently. A thud of
  horses&rsquo; hoofs on the wet ground came to my ear. A second, and it was
  plainer, the noise of some half-dozen riders clearly approaching the inn.
  &rsquo;Twas a lonesome place, and I judged it strange that company should
  come so late.</p>

  <p>I flung myself on the bed in my clothes, and could almost have fallen
  asleep as I was, so weary was my body. But there was that in my mind which
  forbade slumber, a vague uneasiness as of some ill approaching, which it
  behooved me to combat. Again and again I tried to drive it from me as mere
  cowardice, but again it returned to vex me. There was nothing for it but that
  I should lie on my back and bide what might come.</p>

  <p>Then again I heard a sound, this time from a room beneath. &rsquo;Twas as
  if men were talking softly, and moving to and fro. My curiosity was
  completely aroused, and I thought it no shame to my soldierly honor to slip
  from my room and gather what was the purport of their talk. At such a time,
  and in such a place, it boded no good for me, and the evil face of the
  landlord was ever in my memory. The staircase creaked a little as it felt my
  weight, but it had been built for heavier men, and I passed it in safety.
  Clearly the visitors were in the room where I had supped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will we ha&rsquo;e muckle wark wi&rsquo; him, think ye?&rdquo; I
  heard one man ask.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Na, na,&rdquo; said another, whom I knew for mine host,
  &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a foreigner, a man frae a fremt land, and a&rsquo; folk ken
  they&rsquo;re little use. Forbye, I had stock o&rsquo; him mysel&rsquo;, and
  I think I could mak&rsquo; his bit ribs crack thegither. He&rsquo;ll
  no&rsquo; be an ill customer to deal wi&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But will he no&rsquo; be a guid hand at the swird? There&rsquo;s no
  yin o&rsquo; us here muckle at that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Toots,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll e&rsquo;en get him
  intil a corner, where he&rsquo;ll no git leave to stir an airm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I had no stomach for more. With a dull sense of fear I crept back to my
  room, scarce heeding in my anger whether I made noise or not. Good God!
  thought I, I have traveled by land and sea to die in a moorland alehouse by
  the hand of common robbers! My heart grew hot at the thought of the landlord,
  for I made no doubt but it was my jewels that had first set his teeth. I
  loosened my sword in its scabbard; and now I come to think of it, &rsquo;twas
  a great wonder that it had not been taken away from me while I slept. I could
  only guess that the man had been afraid to approach me before the arrival of
  his confederates. I gripped my sword-hilt; ah, how often had I felt its touch
  under kindlier circumstances&mdash;≠when I slew the boar in the woods at
  Belmont, when I made the Sieur de Biran crave pardon before my feet, when
  I&mdash;&mdash;≠ But peace with such memories! At all events, if Jean de
  Rohaine must die among ruffians, unknown and forgotten, he would finish his
  days like a gentleman of courage. I prayed to God that I might only have the
  life of the leader.</p>

  <p>But this world is sweet to all men, and as I awaited death in that dark
  room, it seemed especially fair to live. I was but in the prime of my age, on
  the near side of forty, hale in body, a master of the arts and graces. Were
  it not passing hard that I should perish in this wise? I looked every way for
  a means of escape. There was but one&mdash;≠the little window which looked
  upon the ground east of the inn. &rsquo;Twas just conceivable that a man
  might leap it and make his way to the hills, and so baffle his pursuers. Two
  thoughts deterred me; first, that I had no horse and could not continue my
  journey; second, that in all likelihood there would be a watch set below. My
  heart sank within me, and I ceased to think.</p>

  <p>For, just at that moment, I heard a noise below as of men leaving the
  room. I shut my lips and waited. Here, I concluded, is death coming to meet
  me. But the next moment the noise had stopped, and &rsquo;twas evident that
  the conclave was not yet closed. &rsquo;Tis a strange thing, the mind of man,
  for I, who had looked with despair at my chances a minute agone, now, at the
  passing of this immediate danger, plucked up heart, clapped my hat on my
  head, and opened the window.</p>

  <p>The night air blew chill, but all seemed silent below. So, very carefully
  I hung over the ledge, gripped the sill with my hands, swung my legs into the
  air, and dropped. I lighted on a tussock of grass and rolled over on my side,
  only to recover myself in an instant and rise to my feet, and, behold, at my
  side, a tall man keeping sentinel on horseback.</p>

  <p>At this the last flicker of hope died in my bosom. The man never moved or
  spake, but only stared fixedly at me. Yet there was that in his face and
  bearing which led me to act as I did.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you are a man of honor,&rdquo; I burst out, &ldquo;though you
  are engaged in an accursed trade, dismount and meet me in combat. Your spawn
  will not be out for a little time, and the night is none so dark. If I must
  die, I would die at least in the open air, with my foe before me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>My words must have found some answering chord in the man&rsquo;s breast,
  for he presently spoke, and asked me my name and errand in the countryside. I
  told him in a dozen words, and at my tale he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am in a great mind,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to let you go. I am
  all but sick of this butcher work, and would fling it to the winds at a word.
  &rsquo;Tis well enough for the others, who are mongrel bred, but it ill
  becomes a man of birth like me, who am own cousin to the Maxwells o&rsquo;
  Drurie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He fell for a very little time into a sort of musing, tugging at his beard
  like a man in perplexity. Then he spoke out suddenly:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See you yon tuft of willows by the water? There&rsquo;s a space
  behind it where a horse and man might stand well concealed. There is your
  horse,&rdquo; and he pointed to a group of horses standing tethered by the
  roadside; &ldquo;lead him to the place I speak of, and trust to God for the
  rest. I will raise a scare that you&rsquo;re off the other airt, and, mind,
  that whenever you see the tails o&rsquo; us, you mount and ride for life in
  the way I tell you. You should win to Drumlanrig by morning, where there are
  quieter folk. Now, mind my bidding, and dae&rsquo;t before my good will
  changes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May God do so to you in your extremity! If ever I meet you on earth
  I will repay you for your mercy. But a word with you. Who is that man?&rdquo;
  and I pointed to the house.</p>

  <p>The fellow laughed dryly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy seen you&rsquo;re no
  acquaint here, or you would ha&rsquo;e heard o&rsquo; Long Jock o&rsquo; the
  Hirsel. There&rsquo;s mony a man would face the devil wi&rsquo; a regiment
  o&rsquo; dragoons at his back, that would flee at a glint from Jock&rsquo;s
  een. You&rsquo;re weel quit o&rsquo; him. But be aff afore the folk are
  stirring.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I needed no second bidding, but led Saladin with all speed to the willows,
  where I made him stand knee-keep in the water within cover of the trees,
  while I crouched by his side. &rsquo;Twas none too soon, for I was scarce in
  hiding when I heard a great racket in the house, and the sound of men
  swearing and mounting horse. There was a loud clattering of hoofs, which
  shortly died away, and left the world quiet, save for the broil of the stream
  and the loud screaming of moorbirds.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">III.&mdash;I FARE BADLY ABROAD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">All this has taken a long time to set down, but there was
  little time in the acting. Scarce half an hour had passed from my waking by
  the black fire till I found myself up to the waist in the stream. I made no
  further delay, but, as soon as the air was quiet, led Saladin out as stilly
  as I could on the far side of the willows, clambered on his back (for I was
  too sore in body to mount in any other fashion), and was riding for dear life
  along the moor road in the contrary direction to that from which I had come
  on the night before. The horse had plainly been well fed, since, doubtless,
  the ruffians had marked him for their own plunder. He covered the ground in
  gallant fashion, driving up jets and splashes of rain water from the pools in
  the way. Mile after mile was passed with no sound of pursuers; one hill gave
  place to another; the stream grew wider and more orderly; but still I kept up
  the breakneck pace, fearing to slacken rein. Fifteen miles were covered, as I
  judged, before I saw the first light of dawn in the sky, a red streak in a
  gray desert; and brought my horse down to a trot, thanking God that at last I
  was beyond danger.</p>

  <p>I was sore in body, with clammy garments sticking to my skin, aching in
  back and neck, unslept, well-nigh as miserable as a man could be. But great
  as was my bodily discomfort, &rsquo;twas not one tittle to compare with the
  sickness of my heart. I had been driven to escape from a hostel by a window
  like a common thief; compelled to ride,&mdash;≠nay, there was no use in
  disguising it,&mdash;≠to flee, before a pack of ill-bred villains; I, a
  gentleman of France, who had ruffled it with the best of them in my fit of
  prosperity. Again and again I questioned with myself whether I had not done
  better to die in that place, fighting as long as the breath was in my body.
  Of this I am sure, at any rate, that it would have been the way more soothing
  to my pride. I argued the matter with myself, according to the most approved
  logic, but could come no nearer to the solution. For while I thought the
  picture of myself dying with my back to the wall the more heroical and
  gentleman-like, it yet went sore against me to think of myself, with all my
  skill of the sword and the polite arts, perishing in a desert place at the
  hand of common cut-throats. &rsquo;Twas no fear of death, I give my word of
  honor; that was a weakness never found in our race. Courage is a virtue I
  take no credit for; &rsquo;tis but a matter of upbringing. But a man loves to
  make some noise in the earth ere he leaves it, or at least to pass with
  blowings of the trumpet and some manner of show. To this day I cannot think
  of any way by which I could have mended my conduct. I can but set it down as
  a mischance of Providence, which meets all men in their career, but of which
  no man of spirit cares to think.</p>

  <p>The sun rose clear, but had scarce shone for an hour, when, as is the way
  in this land, a fresh deluge of rain came on, and the dawn, which had begun
  in crimson, ended in a dull level of gray. I had never been used with much
  foul weather of this sort, so I bore it ill. &rsquo;Twas about nine of the
  morning when I rode into the village of Drumlanrig, a jumble of houses in the
  lee of a great wood, which runs up to meet the descending moorlands. Some
  ragged brats, heedless of the weather, played in the street, if one may call
  it by so fine a name; but for the most part the houses seemed quite deserted.
  A woman looked incuriously at me; a man who was carrying sacks scarce raised
  his head to view me; the whole place was like a dwelling of the dead. I have
  since learned the reason, which was no other than the accursed butchery on
  which I had quarreled with Quentin Kennedy, and so fallen upon misfortune.
  The young and manly were all gone; some to the hills for hiding, some to the
  town prisons, some across the seas to work in the plantations, and some on
  that long journey from which no man returns. My heart boils within me to this
  day to think of it&mdash;≠but there! it is long since past, and I have little
  need to be groaning over it now.</p>

  <p>There was no inn in the place, but I bought bread from the folk of a
  little farm-steading at one end of the village street. They would scarce give
  it to me at first, and &rsquo;twas not till they beheld my woebegone plight
  that their hearts relented. Doubtless they took me for one of the soldiers
  who had harried them and theirs, little guessing that &rsquo;twas all for
  their sake that I was in such evil case. I did not tarry to ask the road, for
  Leith was too far distant for the people in that place to know it. Of this
  much I was sure, that it lay to the northeast, so I took my way in that
  direction, shaping my course by the sun. There was a little patch of green
  fields, a clump of trees, and a quiet stream beside the village; but I had
  scarce ridden half a mile beyond it when once more the moor swallowed me up
  in its desert of moss and wet heather.</p>

  <p>I was now doubly dispirited. My short exhilaration of escape had gone, and
  all the pangs of wounded pride and despair seized upon me, mingled with a
  sort of horror of the place I had come through. Whenever I saw a turn of hill
  which brought the <i>Angel&rsquo;s Ladder</i> to my mind, I shivered in spite
  of myself, and could have found it in my heart to turn and flee. In addition,
  I would have you remember, I was soaked to the very skin, my eyes weary with
  lack of sleep, and my legs cramped with much riding.</p>

  <p>The place in the main was moorland, with steep, desolate hills on my left.
  On the right to the south I had glimpses of a fairer country, woods and
  distant fields, seen for an instant through the driving mist. In a trice
  France was back in my mind, for I could not see an acre of green land without
  coming nigh to tears. Yet, and perhaps &rsquo;twas fortunate for me, such
  glimpses were all too rare. For the most part, the way was a long succession
  of sloughs and mires, with here a piece of dry, heathy ground, and there an
  impetuous water coming down from the highlands. Saladin soon fell tired, and,
  indeed, small wonder, since he had come many miles, and his fare had been of
  the scantiest. He would put his foot in a bog-hole and stumble so sharply
  that I would all but lose my seat. Then, poor beast, he would take shame to
  himself, and pick his way as well as his weary legs would suffer him.
  &rsquo;Twas an evil plight for man and steed, and I knew not which to pity
  the more.</p>

  <p>At noon, I came to the skirts of a long hill, whose top was hidden with
  fog, but which I judged to be high and lonesome. I met a man&mdash;≠the first
  I had seen since Drumlanrig&mdash;≠and asked him my whereabouts. I learned
  that the hill was called Queen&rsquo;s Berry, and that in some dozen miles I
  would strike the high road to Edinburgh. I could get not another word out of
  him, but must needs content myself with this crumb of knowledge. The road in
  front was no road, nothing but a heathery moor, with walls of broken stones
  seaming it like the lines of sewing in an old coat. Gray broken hills came up
  for a minute, as a stray wind blew the mist aside, only to disappear the next
  instant in a ruin of cloud.</p>

  <p>From this place I mark the beginning of the most wretched journey in my
  memory. Till now I had had some measure of bodily strength to support me. Now
  it failed, and a cold shivering fit seized on my vitals, and more than once I
  was like to have fallen from my horse. A great stupidity came over my brain;
  I could call up no remembrance to cheer me, but must plod on in a horror of
  darkness. The cause was not far distant&mdash;≠cold, wet, and despair. I
  tried to swallow some of the rain-soaked bread in my pouch, but my mouth was
  as dry as a skin. I dismounted to drink at a stream, but the water could
  hardly trickle down my throat so much did it ache. &rsquo;Twas as if I were
  on the eve of an ague, and in such a place it were like to be the end of
  me.</p>

  <p>Had there been a house, I should have craved shelter. But one effect of my
  sickness was, that I soon strayed woefully from my path, such as it was, and
  found myself in an evil case with bogs and steep hillsides. I had much to do
  in keeping Saladin from danger; and had I not felt the obligation to behave
  like a man, I should have flung the reins on his neck and let him bear
  himself and his master to destruction. Again and again I drove the wish from
  my mind&mdash;≠&ldquo;As well die in a bog-hole or break your neck over a
  crag as dwine away with ague in the cold heather, as you are like to
  do,&rdquo; said the tempter. But I steeled my heart, and made a great resolve
  to keep one thing, though I should lose all else&mdash;≠some shreds of my
  manhood.</p>

  <p>Toward evening I grew so ill that I was fain, when we came to a level
  place, to lay my head on Saladin&rsquo;s neck, and let him stumble forward.
  My head swam, and my back ached so terribly that I guessed feverishly that
  someone had stabbed me unawares. The weather cleared just about even, and the
  light of day flickered out in a watery sunset. &rsquo;Twas like the close of
  my life, I thought, a gray ill day and a poor ending. The notion depressed me
  miserably. I felt a kinship with that feeble evening light, a kinship
  begotten of equality in weakness. However, all would soon end; my day must
  presently have its evening; and then, if all tales were true, and my prayers
  had any efficacy, I should be in a better place.</p>

  <p>But when once the night in its blackness had set in, I longed for the
  light again, however dismal it might be. A ghoulish song, one which I had
  heard long before, was ever coming to my memory:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">La pluye nous a dÈbuez et lavez, Et le soleil dessÈchez et
  noirciz: Pies, corbeaulx&mdash;.</p><br>

  <p>With a sort of horror I tried to drive it from my mind. A dreadful
  heaviness oppressed me. Fears which I am ashamed to set down thronged my
  brain. The way had grown easier, or I make no doubt my horse had fallen.
  &rsquo;Twas a track we were on, I could tell by the greater freedom with
  which Saladin stepped. God send, I prayed, that we be near to folk, and that
  they be kindly; this prayer I said many times to the accompaniment of the
  whistling of the doleful wind. Every gust pained me. I was the sport of the
  weather, a broken puppet tossed about by circumstance.</p>

  <p>Now an answer was sent to me, and that a speedy one. I came of a sudden to
  a clump of shrubbery beside a wall. Then at a turn of the way a light shone
  through, as from a broad window among trees. A few steps more and I stumbled
  on a gate, and turned Saladin&rsquo;s head up a pathway. The rain dripped
  heavily from the bushes, a branch slashed me in the face, and my weariness
  grew tenfold with every second. I dropped like a log before the door, scarce
  looking to see whether the house was great or little; and, ere I could knock
  or make any call, swooned away dead on the threshold.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">IV.&mdash;OF MY COMING TO LINDEAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When I came to myself I was lying in a pleasant room with a
  great flood of sunlight drifting through the window. My brain was so confused
  that it was many minutes ere I could guess in which part of the earth I was
  laid. My first thought was that I was back in France, and I rejoiced with a
  great gladness; but as my wits cleared the past came back by degrees, till I
  had it plain before me, from my setting-out to my fainting at the door.
  Clearly I was in the house where I had arrived on the even of yesterday.</p>

  <p>I stirred, and found my weakness gone, and my health, save for some
  giddiness in the head, quite recovered. This was ever the way of our family,
  who may be in the last desperation one day and all alive and active the next.
  Our frames are like the old grape tendrils, slim, but tough as whipcord.</p>

  <p>At my first movement someone arose from another part of the room and came
  forward. I looked with curiosity, and found that it was a girl, who brought
  me some strengthening food-stuff in a bowl. The sunlight smote her full in
  the face and set her hair all aglow, as if she were the Madonna. I could not
  see her well, but, as she bent over me, she seemed tall and lithe and pretty
  to look upon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How feel you?&rdquo; she asked, in a strange, soft accent, speaking
  the pure English, but with a curious turn in her voice. &ldquo;I trust you
  are better of your ailment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that I am,&rdquo; I said briskly, for I was ashamed to be
  lying there in good health, &ldquo;and I would thank you, mademoiselle, for
  your courtesy to a stranger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;&rsquo;twas but common humanity.
  You were sore spent last night, both man and horse. Had you traveled far? But
  no,&rdquo; she added hastily, seeing me about to plunge into a narrative;
  &ldquo;your tale will keep. I cannot have you making yourself ill again. You
  had better bide still a little longer.&rdquo; And with a deft hand she
  arranged the pillows and was gone.</p>

  <p>For some time I lay in a pleasing inaction. &rsquo;Twas plain I had fallen
  among gentlefolk, and I blessed the good fortune which had led me to the
  place. Here I might find one to hear my tale and help me in my ill-luck. At
  any rate for the present I was in a good place, and when one has been living
  in a nightmare, the present has the major part in his thoughts. With this I
  fell asleep again, for I was still somewhat wearied in body.</p>

  <p>When I awoke &rsquo;twas late afternoon. The evil weather seemed to have
  gone, for the sun was bright and the sky clear with the mellowness of
  approaching even. The girl came again and asked me how I fared.
  &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;perhaps you wish to rise, if you are
  stronger. Your clothes were sadly wet and torn when we got you to bed last
  night, so my father has bade me ask you to accept of another suit till your
  own may be in better order. See, I have laid them out for you, if you will
  put them on.&rdquo; And again, ere I could thank her, she was gone.</p>

  <p>I was surprised and somewhat affected by this crowning kindness, and at
  the sight of so much care for a stranger whose very name was unknown. I
  longed to meet at once with the men of the house, so I sprung up and drew the
  clothes toward me. They were of rough gray cloth, very strong and warm, and
  fitting a man a little above the ordinary height, of such stature as mine is.
  It did not take me many minutes to dress, and when once more I found myself
  arrayed in wholesome garments I felt my spirit returning, and with it came
  hope, and a kindlier outlook on the world.</p>

  <p>No one appeared, so I opened my chamber door and found myself at the head
  of a staircase, which turned steeply down almost from the threshold. A great
  window illumined it, and many black-framed pictures hung on the walls adown
  it. At the foot there was a hall, broad and low in the roof, whence some two
  or three doors opened. Sounds of men in conversation came from one, so I
  judged it wise to turn there. With much curiosity I lifted the latch and
  entered unbidden.</p>

  <p>&rsquo;Twas a little room, well furnished, and stocked to the very ceiling
  with books. A fire burned on the hearth, by which sat two men talking. They
  rose to their feet as I entered, and I marked them well. One was an elderly
  man of maybe sixty years, with a bend in his back as if from study. His face
  was narrow and kindly; blue eyes, like a Northman, a thin, twitching lip, and
  hair well turned to silver. His companion was scarce less notable&mdash;≠a
  big, comely man, dressed half in the fashion of a soldier, yet with the air
  of one little versed in cities. I love to be guessing a man&rsquo;s station
  from his looks, and ere I had glanced him over, I had set him down in my mind
  as a country <i>laird</i>, as these folk call it. Both greeted me
  courteously, and then, as I advanced, were silent, as if waiting for me to
  give some account of myself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have come to thank you for your kindness,&rdquo; said I
  awkwardly, &ldquo;and to let you know something of myself, for &rsquo;tis ill
  to be harboring folk without names or dwelling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; said the younger; &ldquo;&rsquo;twere a barbarity to
  leave anyone without, so travel-worn as you. The Levite in the Scriptures did
  no worse. But how feel you now? I trust your fatigue is gone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thank you a thousand times for your kindness. Would I knew how to
  repay it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, young man,&rdquo; said the elder, &ldquo;give thanks not to
  us, but to the Lord who led you to this place. The moors are hard bedding,
  and right glad I am that you fell in with us here. &rsquo;Tis seldom we have
  a stranger with us, since my brother at Drumlanrig died in the spring
  o&rsquo; last year. But I trust you are better, and that Anne has looked
  after you well. A maid is a blessing to sick folk, if a weariness to the
  hale.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You speak truly,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;a maid is a blessing to the
  sick. &rsquo;Tis sweet to be well tended when you have fared hardly for days.
  Your kindness has set me at peace with the world again. Yesterday all was
  black before me, and now, I bethink me, I see a little ray of
  light.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a good work,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;to give
  you hope and set you right with yourself, if so chance we have done it. What
  saith the wise man, &rsquo;He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a
  city that is broken down and without walls&rsquo;? But whence have you come?
  We would hear your story.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So I told them the whole tale of my wanderings, from my coming to Kennedy
  to my fainting fit at their own threshold. At the story of my quarrel they
  listened eagerly, and I could mark their eyes flashing, and as I spake of my
  sufferings in the desert I could see sympathy in their faces. When I
  concluded, neither spake for a little, till the elder man broke silence
  with:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May God bless and protect you in all your goings! Well I see that
  you are of the upright in heart. It makes me blithe to have you in my
  house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The younger said nothing but rose and came to me.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;M. de Rohaine,&rdquo; he said, speaking my name badly, &ldquo;give
  me your hand. I honor you for a gentleman and a man of feeling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I am glad to give it you,&rdquo; said I, and we clasped hands
  and looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes. Then we stepped back well satisfied.
  For myself I love to meet a man, and in the great-limbed young fellow before
  me I found one to my liking.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now I must tell you of ourselves,&rdquo; said the old man,
  &ldquo;for &rsquo;tis fitting that a guest should know his entertainers. This
  is the manse of Lindean, and I am the unworthy man, Ephraim Lambert, whom God
  hath appointed to watch over his flock in this place. Sore, sore are we
  troubled by evil men, such as you have known; and my folk, from dwelling in
  decent cots, have to hide in peat-hags and the caves of the hills. The
  Lord&rsquo;s hand is heavy upon this country; &rsquo;tis a time of trial, a
  passing through the furnace. God grant we be not found faithless! This home
  is still left to us, and thankful we should be for it; and I demand that you
  dwell with us till you have settled on your course. This man,&rdquo; he went
  on, laying his hand on the shoulder of the younger, &ldquo;is Master Henry
  Semple of Clachlands, a fine inheritance, all ridden and rieved by these
  devils on earth, Captain Keith&rsquo;s dragoons. Henry is of our belief, and
  a man of such mettle that the Privy Council was fain to send down a
  quartering of soldiers to bide in his house and devour his substance.
  &rsquo;Twas a thing no decent man could thole, so off he comes here to keep
  us company till the wind blows by. If you look out of the window over by the
  side of yon rig of hill, ye&rsquo;ll get a glimmer of Clachlands chimneys,
  reeking with the smoke of their evil preparations. Ay, ay, lads, burn you
  your peats and fill up the fire with logs till the vent&rsquo;s choked, but
  you&rsquo;ll burn brawly yourselves some fine day, when your master gives you
  your wages.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked out as he spoke, and into his kindly eyes came a gleam of such
  anger and decision as quite transfigured his face and made it seem more like
  that of a troop captain than a peaceful minister.</p>

  <p>And now Master Semple spoke up: &ldquo;God send, sir, they suffer for no
  worse a crime than burning my peats and fire-wood. I should count myself a
  sorry fellow if I made any complaint about a little visitation, when the hand
  of the Lord is smiting so sorely among my fellows. I could take shame to
  myself every time I eat good food or sleep in a decent bed, to think of
  better men creeping aneath the lang heather like etherts, or shivering on the
  cauld hill-side. There&rsquo;ll be no such doings in your land, M. de
  Rohaine? I&rsquo;ve heard tell of folk there like us, dwelling in the hills
  to escape the abominations of Rome. But perhaps,&rdquo; and he hesitated,
  &ldquo;you are not of them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am of your enemies by upbringing; but I
  dearly love a brave man, whereever I meet him. &rsquo;Tis poor religion, say
  I, which would lead one to see no virtue in those of another belief. There is
  one God above all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, you speak truly,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;He has made of
  one blood all the nations of the earth. But I yearn to see you of a better
  way of thinking. Mayhap I may yet show you your errors?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, but I hold by &lsquo;every man to his
  upbringing.&rsquo; Each man to the creed of his birth. &rsquo;Tis a poor
  thing to be changing on any pretext. For, look you, God, who appointed a man
  his place of birth, set him his religion with it, and I hold if he but stick
  to it he is not far in error.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I spoke warmly, but in truth I had thought all too little about such
  things. One who has to fight his way among men and live hardly, has, of
  necessity, little time for his devotions, and if he but live cleanly, his
  part is well done. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> Who will gainsay me?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I fear your logic is faulty,&rdquo; said Master Semple, &ldquo;but
  it is mighty inhospitable to be arguing with a guest. See, here Anne comes
  with the lamp, and supper will soon be ready.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl came in as he spake, bearing a great lamp, which she placed on a
  high shelf, and set about laying the table for supper. I had noticed her
  little at first sight, for I was never given to staring at maids; but now, as
  she moved about, I found myself ever watching her. The ruddy firelight
  striving with the serene glow of the lamp met and flickered about her face
  and hair. She was somewhat brown in skin, like a country maiden; but there
  was no semblance of rusticity in her fair features and deep brown eyes. Her
  hair hung over her neck as brown as the soft fur of a squirrel, and the fire
  filled it with fantastic shadows. She was singularly graceful in figure,
  moving through the room and bending over the table with a grace which
  &rsquo;twas pretty to contemplate. &rsquo;Twas strange to note that when her
  face was averted one might have guessed her to be some village girl or
  burgher&rsquo;s daughter; but as soon as she had turned her imperial eyes on
  you she looked like a queen in a play. Her face was a curious one, serious
  and dignified beyond her years and sex, yet with odd sparkles of gayety
  dancing in her eyes and the corners of her rosy mouth.</p>

  <p>Master Semple had set about helping her, and a pretty sight it was to see
  her reproving and circumventing his clumsiness. &rsquo;Twas not hard to see
  the relation between the two. The love-light shone in his eye whenever he
  looked toward her; and she, for her part, seemed to thrill at his chance
  touch. One strange thing I noted, that, whereas in France two young folks
  could not have gone about the business of setting a supper-table without much
  laughter and frolic, all was done here as if &rsquo;twere some solemn
  ceremonial.</p>

  <p>To one who was still sick with the thought of the black uplands he had
  traversed, of the cold, driving rain and the deadly bogs, the fare in the
  manse was like the apple to Eve in the garden. &rsquo;Twas fine to be eating
  crisp oaten cakes, and butter fresh from the churn, to be drinking sweet,
  warm milk&mdash;≠for we lived on the plainest; and, above all, to watch
  kindly faces around you in place of marauders and low ruffians. The minister
  said a lengthy grace before and after the meal; and when the table was
  cleared the servants were called in to evening prayer. Again the sight
  pleased me&mdash;≠the two maids with their brown country faces seated
  decently by the door; Anne, half in shadow, sitting demurely with Master
  Semple not far off, and at the table-head the white hairs of the old man
  bowed over the Bible. He read I know not what, for I am not so familiar with
  the Scriptures as I should be, and, moreover, Anne&rsquo;s grave face was a
  more entrancing study. Then we knelt, and he prayed to God to watch over us
  in all our ways and bring us at last to his prepared kingdom. Truly, when I
  arose from my knees, I felt more tempted to be devout than I have any
  remembrance of before.</p>

  <p>Then we sat and talked of this and that, and I must tell over all my
  misfortunes again for mademoiselle&rsquo;s entertainment. She listened with
  open wonder, and thanked me with her marvelous eyes. Then to bed with a
  vile-smelling lamp, in a wide, low-ceilinged sleeping room, where the sheets
  were odorous of bog-myrtle and fresh as snow. Sleep is a goddess easy of
  conquest when wooed in such a fashion.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">V.&mdash;I PLEDGE MY WORD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Of my life at Lindean for the next three days I have no
  clear remembrance. The weather was dry and languid, as often follows a spell
  of rain, and the long hills which huddled around the house looked near and
  imminent. The place was so still that if one shouted it seemed almost a
  profanation. &rsquo;Twas so Sabbath-like that I almost came to dislike it.
  Indeed, I doubt I should have found it irksome had there not been a brawling
  stream in the glen, which kept up a continuous dashing and chattering. It
  seemed the one link between me and that far-away world in which not long
  agone I had been a dweller.</p>

  <p>The life, too, was as regular as in the king&rsquo;s court. Sharp at six I
  was awakened, and ere seven we were assembled for breakfast. Then to prayers,
  and then to the occupations of the day. The minister would be at his books or
  down among his people on some errand of mercy. The church had been long
  closed, for the Privy Council, seeing that Master Lambert was opposed to
  them, had commanded him to be silent; and yet, mark you, so well was he loved
  in the place that they durst set no successor in his stead. They tried it
  once and a second time, but the unhappy man was so taken with fear of the
  people that he shook the dust of Lindean off his feet, and departed in search
  of a more hospitable dwelling. But the minister&rsquo;s mouth was shut, save
  when covertly, and with the greatest peril to himself, he would preach at a
  meeting of the hill-folk in the recesses of the surrounding uplands.</p>

  <p>The library I found no bad one&mdash;≠I who in my day have been considered
  to have something of a taste in books. To be sure there was much wearisome
  stuff, the work of old divines, and huge commentaries on the Scriptures,
  written in Latin and plentifully interspersed with Greek and Hebrew. But
  there was good store of the Classics, both prose and
  poetry,&mdash;≠<i>Horace</i>, who has ever been my favorite, and
  <i>Homer</i>, who, to my thinking, is the finest of the ancients. Here, too,
  I found a <i>Plato</i>, and I swear I read more of him in the manse than I
  have done since I went through him with M. Clerselier, when we were students
  together in Paris.</p>

  <p>The acquaintance which I had formed with Master Semple speedily ripened
  into a fast friendship. I found it in my heart to like this great serious
  man&mdash;≠a bumpkin if you will, but a man of courage and kindliness. We
  were wont to take long walks, always in some lonely part of the country, and
  we grew more intimate in our conversation than I should ever have dreamed of.
  He would call me John, and this much I suffered him, to save my name from the
  barbarity of his pronunciation; while in turn I fell to calling him Henry, as
  if we had been born and bred together. I found that he loved to hear of my
  own land and my past life, which, now that I think of it, must have had no
  little interest to one dwelling in such solitudes. From him I heard of his
  father, of his brief term at the College of Edinburgh, which he left when the
  strife in the country grew high, and of his sorrow and anger at the
  sufferings of those who withstood the mandate of the king. Though I am of the
  true faith, I think it no shame that my sympathy was all with these rebels,
  for had I not seen something of their misery myself? But above all, he would
  speak of <i>la belle Anne</i> as one gentleman will tell another of his love,
  when he found that I was a willing listener. I could scarce have imagined
  such warmth of passion to exist in the man as he showed at the very mention
  of her name.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he would cry out, &ldquo;I would die for her; I would
  gang to the world&rsquo;s end to pleasure her! I whiles think that I break
  the first commandment every day of my life, for I canna keep her a moment out
  of my thoughts, and I fear she&rsquo;s more to me than any earthly thing
  should be. I think of her at nicht. I see her name in every page of the Book.
  I thought I was bad when I was over at Clachlands, and had to ride five miles
  to see her; but now I&rsquo;m tenfold worse when I&rsquo;m biding aside her.
  God grant it be not counted to me for sin!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amen to that,&rdquo; said I. &rsquo;Tis a fine thing to see the
  love of a maid; but I hold &rsquo;tis a finer to witness the passion of a
  strong man.</p>

  <p>Yet, withal, there was something sinister about the house and its folk
  which to me was the fly in the ointment. They were kindness and charity
  incarnate, but they were cold and gloomy to boot, lacking any grace or
  sprightliness in their lives. I find it hard to write this, for their
  goodness to me was beyond recompense; yet I must set it down, since in some
  measure it has to do with my story. The old man would look at me at times and
  sigh, nor did I think it otherwise than fitting, till I found from his words
  that the sighs were on account of my own spiritual darkness. I have no
  quarrel with any man for wishing to convert me, but to sigh at one&rsquo;s
  approach seems a doleful way of setting about it. Then he would break out
  from his wonted quietness at times to rail at his foes, calling down the
  wrath of Heaven to blight them. Such a fit was always followed by a painful
  exhaustion, which left him as weak as a child, and shivering like a leaf. I
  bitterly cursed the state of a country which could ruin the peace of mind of
  a man so sweet-tempered by nature, and make him the sport of needless rage.
  &rsquo;Twas pitiful to see him creep off to his devotions after any such
  outbreak, penitent and ashamed. Even to his daughter he was often cruelly
  sharp, and would call her to account for the merest trifle.</p>

  <p>As for Master Henry, what shall I say of him? I grew to love him like my
  own brother, yet I no more understood him than the Sultan of Turkey. He had
  strange fits of gloom, begotten, I must suppose, of the harsh country and his
  many anxieties, in which he was more surly than a bear, speaking little, and
  that mainly from the Scriptures. I have one case in my memory, when, had I
  not been in a sense his guest, I had scarce refrained from quarreling.
  &rsquo;Twas in the afternoon of the second day, when we returned weary from
  one of our long wanderings. Anne tripped forth into the autumn sunlight
  singing a catch, a simple glee of the village folk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace, Anne,&rdquo; says Master Henry savagely; &ldquo;it little
  becomes you to be singing in these days, unless it be a godly psalm. Keep
  your songs for better times.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What ails you?&rdquo; I ventured to say. &ldquo;You praised her
  this very morning for singing the self-same verses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And peace, you,&rdquo; he says roughly, as he entered the house;
  &ldquo;if the lass hearkened to your accursed creed, I should have stronger
  words for her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>My breath was fairly taken from me at this incredible rudeness. I had my
  hand on my sword, and had I been in my own land we should soon have settled
  it. As it was, I shut my lips firmly and choked down my choler.</p>

  <p>Yet I cannot leave with this ill word of the man. That very night he
  talked with me so pleasingly, and with so friendly a purport, that I
  conceived he must have been scarce himself when he so insulted me. Indeed, I
  discerned two natures in the man&mdash;≠one, hard, saturnine, fanatically
  religious; the other, genial and kindly, like that of any other gentleman of
  family. The former I attributed to the accident of his fortune; the second I
  held to be the truer, and in my thoughts of him still think of it as the only
  one.</p>

  <p>But I must pass to the events which befell on the even of the third day,
  and wrought so momentous a change in the life at Lindean. &rsquo;Twas just at
  the lighting of the lamp, when Anne and the minister and myself sat talking
  in the little sitting room, that Master Henry entered with a look of great
  concern on his face, and beckoned the elder man out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Andrew Gibb is here,&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what may Andrew Gibb be wanting?&rdquo; asked the old man,
  glancing up sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He brings nae guid news, I fear, but he&rsquo;ll tell them to none
  but you; so hasten out, sir, to the back, for he&rsquo;s come far, and
  he&rsquo;s ill at the waiting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The twain were gone for some time, and in their absence I could hear high
  voices in the back end of the house, conversing as on some matter of deep
  import. Anne fetched the lamp from the kitchen and trimmed it with elaborate
  care, lighting it and setting it in its place. Then, at last, the minister
  returned alone.</p>

  <p>I was shocked at the sight of him as he re-entered the room. His face was
  ashen pale and tightly drawn about the lips. He crept to a chair and leaned
  his head on the table, speaking no word. Then he burst out of a sudden into a
  storm of pleading.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Lord God,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;thou hast aye been good to us,
  thou has kept us weel, and bielded us frae the wolves who have sought to
  devour us. Oh, dinna leave us now. It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; for mysel&rsquo; or
  Henry that I care. We&rsquo;re men, and can warstle through ills; but oh,
  what am I to dae wi&rsquo; the bit helpless lassie? It&rsquo;s awfu&rsquo; to
  have to gang oot among hills and bogs to bide, but it&rsquo;s ten times waur
  when ye dinna ken what&rsquo;s gaun to come to your bairn. Hear me, O Lord,
  and grant me my request. I&rsquo;ve no&rsquo; been a&rsquo; that I micht have
  been, but oh, if I ha&rsquo;e tried to serve thee at a&rsquo;, dinna let this
  danger overwhelm us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had scarcely finished, and was still sitting with bowed head, when
  Master Henry also entered the room. His eyes were filled with an austere
  frenzy, such as I had learned to look for.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis a time for us a&rsquo;
  to be on our knees. But ha&rsquo;e courage, and dinna let us spoil the guid
  cause by our weak mortal complaining. Is&rsquo;t no&rsquo; better to be
  hunkering in a moss-hole and communing with the Lord than waxing fat like
  Jeshurun in carnal corruption? Call on God&rsquo;s name, but no&rsquo;
  wi&rsquo; sighing, but wi&rsquo; exaltation, for He hath bidden us to a
  mighty heritage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye speak brave and true, Henry, and I&rsquo;m wi&rsquo; your every
  word. But tell me what&rsquo;s to become o&rsquo; my bairn? What will Anne
  dae? I once thought there was something atween you&mdash;&mdash;≠&rdquo; He
  stopped abruptly and searched the face of the young man.</p>

  <p>At his words Master Semple had started as under a lash. &ldquo;Oh, my
  God,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I had forgotten! Anne, Anne, my dearie, we canna
  leave ye, and you to be my wife. This is a sore trial of faith, sir, and I
  misdoubt I canna stand it. To leave ye to the tender mercies o&rsquo;
  a&rsquo; the hell-hounds o&rsquo; dragoons&mdash;≠oh, I canna
  dae&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He clapped his hand to his forehead and walked about the room like a man
  distraught.</p>

  <p>And now I put in my word. &ldquo;What ails you, Henry? Tell me, for I am
  sore grieved to see you in such perplexity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ails me?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Aye, I will tell ye what ails
  me&rdquo;; and he drew his chair before me. &ldquo;Andrew Gibb&rsquo;s come
  ower frae the Ruthen wi&rsquo; shure news that a warrant&rsquo;s oot against
  us baith, for being at the preaching on Callowa&rsquo; Muir. &rsquo;Twas an
  enemy did it, and now the soldiers are coming at ony moment to lay hands on
  us and take us off to Embro&rsquo;. Then there&rsquo;ll be but a short lease
  of life for us; and unless we take to the hills this very nicht we may be
  ower late in the morning. I&rsquo;m wae to tak&rsquo; sae auld a man as
  Master Lambert to wet mosses, but there&rsquo;s nothing else to be dune. But
  what&rsquo;s to become o&rsquo; Anne? Whae&rsquo;s to see to her, when the
  dragoons come riding and cursing about the toon? Oh, it&rsquo;s a terrible
  time, John. Pray to God, if ye never prayed before, to let it
  pass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle had meantime spoken never a word, but had risen and gone to
  her father&rsquo;s chair and put her arms around his neck. Her presence
  seemed to cheer the old man, for he ceased mourning and looked up, while she
  sat, still as a statue, with her grave, lovely face against his. But Master
  Semple&rsquo;s grief was pitiful to witness. He rocked himself to and fro in
  his chair, with his arms folded and a set, white face. Every now and then he
  would break into a cry like a stricken animal. The elder man was the first to
  counsel patience.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop, Henry,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s ill-befitting
  Christian folk to set sic an example. We&rsquo;ve a&rsquo; got our troubles,
  and if ours are heavier than some, it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; for us to complain.
  Think o&rsquo; the many years o&rsquo; grace we&rsquo;ve had. There&rsquo;s
  nae doubt the Lord will look after the bairn, for he&rsquo;s a guid Shepherd
  for the feckless.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But now of a sudden a thought seemed to strike Henry, and he was on his
  feet in a twinkling and by my side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; he almost screamed in my ear, &ldquo;John, I&rsquo;m
  going to ask ye for the greatest service that ever man asked. Ye&rsquo;ll
  no&rsquo; say me nay?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me hear it,&rdquo; said I.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will <i>you</i> bide wi&rsquo; the lass? You&rsquo;re a man
  o&rsquo; birth, and I&rsquo;ll swear to it, a man o&rsquo; honor. I can trust
  you as I would trust my ain brither. Oh, man, dinna deny me! It&rsquo;s the
  last hope I ha&rsquo;e, for if ye refuse, we maun e&rsquo;en gang to the
  hills and leave the puir thing alane. Oh, ye canna say me nae! Tell me that
  ye&rsquo;ll do my asking.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I was so thunderstruck at the request that I scarce could think for some
  minutes. Consider, was it not a strange thing to be asked to stay alone in a
  wild moorland house with another man&rsquo;s betrothed, for Heaven knew how
  many weary days? My life and prospects were none so cheerful for me to
  despise anything, nor so varied that I might pick and choose; but yet
  &rsquo;twas dreary, if no worse, to look forward to any length of time in
  this desolate place. I was grateful for the house as a shelter by the way,
  yet I hoped to push on and get rid, as soon as might be, of this accursed
  land.</p>

  <p>But was I not bound by all the ties of gratitude to grant my host&rsquo;s
  request? They had found me fainting at their door, they had taken me in, and
  treated me to their best; I was bound in common honor to do something to
  requite their kindness. And let me add, though not often a man subject to any
  feelings of compassion, whatever natural bent I had this way having been
  spoiled in the wars, I nevertheless could not refrain from pitying the
  distress of that strong man before me. I felt tenderly toward him, more so
  than I had felt to anyone for many a day.</p>

  <p>All these thoughts raced through my head in the short time while Master
  Henry stood before me. The look in his eyes, the pained face of the old man,
  and the sight of Anne, so fair and helpless, fixed my determination.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am bound to you in gratitude,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I would
  seek to repay you. I will bide in the house, if so you will, and be the
  maid&rsquo;s protector. God grant I may be faithful to my trust, and may he
  send a speedy end to your exile?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So &rsquo;twas all finished in a few minutes, and I was fairly embarked
  upon the queerest enterprise of my life. For myself I sat dazed and
  meditative; as for the minister and Master Semple, one-half of the burden
  seemed to be lifted from their minds. I was amazed at the trusting natures of
  these men, who had habited all their days with honest folk till they
  conceived all to be as worthy as themselves. I felt, I will own, a certain
  shrinking from the responsibility of the task; but the Rubicon had been
  crossed and there was no retreat.</p>

  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Of the rest of that night how shall I tell? There was such a bustling and
  pother as I had never seen in any house since the day that my brother Denis
  left Rohaine for the Dutch wars. There was a running and scurrying about, a
  packing of food, a seeking of clothes, for the fugitives must be off before
  the first light. Anne went about with a pale, tearful face; and &rsquo;twas a
  matter of no surprise, for to see a father, a man frail and fallen in years,
  going out to the chill moorlands in the early autumn till no man knew when,
  is a grievous thing for a young maid. Her lover was scarce in so dire a case,
  for he was young and strong, and well used to the life of the hills. For him
  there was hope; for the old man but a shadow. My heart grew as bitter as gall
  at the thought of the villains who brought it about.</p>

  <p>How shall I tell of the morning, when the faint light was flushing the
  limits of the sky, and the first call of a heath-bird broke the silence!
  &rsquo;Twas sad to see these twain with their bundles (the younger carrying
  the elder&rsquo;s share) creep through the heather toward the hills. They
  affected a cheerful resolution, assumed to comfort Anne&rsquo;s fears and
  sorrow; but I could mark beneath it a settled despair. The old man prayed at
  the threshold, and clasped his daughter many times, kissing her and giving
  her his blessing. The younger, shaken with great sobs, bade a still more
  tender farewell, and then started off abruptly to hide his grief. Anne and I,
  from the door, watched their figures disappear over the crest of the ridge,
  and then went in, sober and full of angry counsels.</p>

  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>The soldiers came about an hour before mid-day&mdash;≠a band from
  Clachlands, disorderly ruffians, commanded by a mealy-faced captain. They
  were a scurrilous set, their faces bloated with debauchery and their clothes
  in no very decent order. As one might have expected, they were mightily
  incensed at finding their bird flown, and fell to cursing each other with
  great good-will. They poked their low-bred faces into every nook in the house
  and outbuildings; and when at length they had satisfied themselves that there
  was no hope from that quarter, they had all the folk of the dwelling out on
  the green and questioned them one by one. The two serving-lasses were stanch,
  and stoutly denied all knowledge of their master&rsquo;s
  whereabouts&mdash;≠which was indeed no more than the truth. One of the two,
  Jean Crichope by name, when threatened with ill-treatment if she did not
  speak, replied valiantly that she would twist the neck of the first
  scoundrelly soldier who dared to lay finger on her. This I doubt not she
  could have performed, for she was a very daughter of Anak.</p>

  <p>As for Anne and myself, we answered according to our agreement. They were
  very curious to know my errand there and my name and birth; and when I bade
  them keep their scurvy tongues from defiling a gentleman&rsquo;s house, they
  were none so well pleased. I am not a vain man, and I do not set down the
  thing I am going to relate as at all redounding to my credit; I merely tell
  it as an incident in my tale.</p>

  <p>The captain at last grew angry. He saw that the law was powerless to touch
  us, and that nought remained for him but to ride to the hills in pursuit of
  the fugitives. This he seemed to look upon as a hardship, being a man to all
  appearance more fond of the bottle and pasty than a hill gallop. At any rate
  he grew wroth, and addressed to Anne a speech so full of gross rudeness that
  I felt it my duty to interfere.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look you here, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am here, in the first
  place, to see that no scoundrel maltreats this lady. I would ask you,
  therefore, to be more civil in your talk or to get down and meet me in fair
  fight. These gentlemen,&rdquo; and I made a mocking bow to his company,
  &ldquo;will, I am assured, see an honest encounter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man flushed under his coarse skin. His reputation was at stake. There
  was no other course open but to take up my challenge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You, you bastard Frenchman,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;would you dare
  to insult a captain of the king&rsquo;s dragoons? I&rsquo; faith, I will
  teach you better manners;&rdquo; and he came at me with his sword in a great
  heat. The soldiers crowded round like children to see a cock-fight.</p>
  <br>

         title="Sir Quixote of the Moors - First UK edition">
    <p class="caption">He came at me with his sword in a great heat.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In an instant we crossed swords and fell to; I with the sun in my eyes and
  on the lower ground. The combat was not of long duration. In a trice I found
  that he was a mere child in my hands, a barbarian who used his sword like a
  quarter-staff, not even putting strength into his thrusts.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;this is mere fooling;&rdquo; and
  with a movement which any babe in arms might have checked, twirled his blade
  from his hands and sent it spinning over the grass. &ldquo;Follow your sword,
  and learn two things before you come back&mdash;≠civility to maids and the
  rudiments of sword-play. Bah! Begone with you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Some one of his men laughed, and I think they were secretly glad at their
  tyrant&rsquo;s discomfiture. No more need be said. He picked up his weapon
  and rode away, vowing vengeance upon me and swearing at every trooper behind
  him. I cared not a straw for him, for despite his bravado I knew that the
  fear of death was in his cowardly heart, and that we should be troubled no
  more by his visitations.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">VI.&mdash;IDLE DAYS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I have heard it said by wise folk in France that the autumn
  is of all seasons of the year the most trying to the health of a soldier;
  since, for one accustomed to the heat of action and the fire and fury of
  swift encounter, the decay of summer, the moist, rotting air, and the first
  chill preludes of winter are hard to stand. This may be true of our own
  autumn days, but in the north country &rsquo;twas otherwise. For there the
  weather was as sharp and clear as spring, and the only signs of the season
  were the red leaves and the brown desolate moors. Lindean was built on the
  slope of the hills, with the steeps behind it, and a vista of level land to
  the front: so one could watch from the window the red woods of the low
  country, and see the stream, turgid with past rains, tearing through the
  meadows. The sun rose in the morning in a blaze of gold and crimson; the days
  were temperately warm, the afternoons bright, and the evening another
  procession of colors. &rsquo;Twas all so beautiful that I found it hard to
  keep my thoughts at all on the wanderers in the hills and to think of the
  house as under a dark shadow.</p>

  <p>And if &rsquo;twas hard to do this, &rsquo;twas still harder to look upon
  Anne as a mourning daughter. For the first few days she had been pale and
  silent, going about her household duties as was her wont, speaking rarely,
  and then but to call me to meals. But now the pain of the departure seemed to
  have gone, and though still quiet as ever, there was no melancholy in her
  air; but with a certain cheerful gravity she passed in and out in my sight.
  At first I had had many plans to console her; judge then of my delight to
  find them needless. She was a brave maid, I thought, and little like the
  common, who could see the folly of sighing, and set herself to hope and work
  as best she could.</p>

  <p>The days passed easily enough for me, for I could take Saladin and ride
  through the countryside, keeping always far from Clachlands; or the books in
  the house would stand me in good stead for entertainment. With the evenings
  &rsquo;twas different. When the lamp was lit, and the fire burned,
  &rsquo;twas hard to find some method to make the hours go by. I am not a man
  easily moved, as I have said; and yet I took shame to myself to think of the
  minister and Master Henry in the cold bogs, and Anne and myself before a
  great blaze. Again and again I could have kicked the logs off to ease my
  conscience, and was only held back by respect for the girl. But, of a surety,
  if she had but given me the word, I would have been content to sit in the
  fireless room and enjoy the approval of my heart.</p>

  <p>She played no chess; indeed, I do not believe there was a board in the
  house; nor was there any other sport wherewith to beguile the long evenings.
  Reading she cared little for, and but for her embroidery work I know not what
  she would have set her hand to. So, as she worked with her threads I tried to
  enliven the time with some account of my adventures in past days, and some of
  the old gallant tales with which I was familiar. She heard me gladly,
  listening as no comrade by the tavern-board ever listened; and though, for
  the sake of decency, I was obliged to leave out many of the more diverting,
  yet I flatter myself I won her interest and made the time less dreary. I
  ranged over all my own experience and the memory of those tales which I had
  heard from others&mdash;≠and those who know anything of me know that that is
  not small. I told her of exploits in the Indies and Spain, in Germany and the
  Low Countries, and in far Muscovy, and &rsquo;twas no little pleasure to see
  her eager eyes dance and sparkle at a jest, or grow sad at a sorrowful
  episode. <i>Ma vie!</i> She had wonderful eyes&mdash;≠the most wonderful I
  have ever seen. They were gray in the morning and brown at noonday; now
  sparkling, but for the most part fixedly grave and serene. &rsquo;Twas for
  such eyes, I fancy, that men have done all the temerarious deeds concerning
  womankind which history records.</p>

  <p>It must not be supposed that our life was a lively one, or aught
  approaching gayety. The talking fell mostly to my lot, for she had a great
  habit of silence, acquired from her lonely dwelling-place. Yet I moved her
  more than once to talk about herself.</p>

  <p>I heard of her mother, a distant cousin of Master Semple&rsquo;s father;
  of her death when Anne was but a child of seven; and of the solitary years
  since, spent in study under her father&rsquo;s direction, in household work,
  or in acts of mercy to the poor. She spoke of her father often, and always in
  such a way that I could judge of a great affection between them. Of her lover
  I never heard, and, now that I think the matter over, &rsquo;twas no more
  than fitting. Once, indeed, I stumbled upon his name by chance in the course
  of talk, but as she blushed and started, I vowed to fight shy of it ever
  after.</p>

  <p>As we knew well before, no message from the hills could be sent, since the
  moors were watched as closely as the gateway of a prison. This added to the
  unpleasantness of the position of each of us. In Anne&rsquo;s case there was
  the harassing doubt about the safety of her kinsfolk, that sickening anxiety
  which saps the courage even of strong men. Also, it rendered my duties ten
  times harder. For, had there been any communication between the father or the
  lover and the maid, I should have felt less like a St. Anthony in the desert.
  As it was, I had to fight with a terrible sense of responsibility and
  unlimited power for evil, and God knows how hard that is for any Christian to
  strive with. &rsquo;Twould have been no very hard thing to shut myself in a
  room, or bide outside all day, and never utter a word to Anne save only the
  most necessary; but I was touched by the girl&rsquo;s loneliness and sorrows,
  and, moreover, I conceived it to be a strange way of executing a duty, to
  flee from it altogether. I was there to watch over her, and I swore by the
  Holy Mother to keep the very letter of my oath.</p>

  <p>And so the days dragged by till September was all but gone. I have always
  loved the sky and the vicissitudes of weather, and to this hour the
  impression of these autumn evenings is clear fixed on my mind. Strangely
  enough for that north country, they were not cold, but mild, with a sort of
  acrid mildness; a late summer, with the rigors of winter underlying, like a
  silken glove over a steel gauntlet.</p>

  <p>One such afternoon I remember, when Anne sat busy at some needlework on
  the low bench by the door, and I came and joined her. She had wonderful grace
  of body, and &rsquo;twas a pleasure to watch every movement of her arm as she
  stitched. I sat silently regarding the landscape, the woods streaking the
  bare fields, the thin outline of hills beyond, the smoke rising from
  Clachlands&rsquo; chimneys, and above all, the sun firing the great pool in
  the river, and flaming among clouds in the west. Something of the spirit of
  the place seemed to have entered into the girl, for she laid aside her
  needlework after a while and gazed with brimming eyes on the scene. So we
  sat, feasting our eyes on the picture, each thinking strange thoughts, I
  doubt not. By and by she spoke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is France, that you love so well, more beautiful than this, M. de
  Rohaine?&rdquo; she asked timidly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, more beautiful, but not like this; no, not like
  this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what is it like? I have never seen any place other than
  this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, how shall I tell of it?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis more
  fair than words. We have no rough hills like these, nor torrents like the Lin
  there; but there is a great broad stream by Rohaine, as smooth as a
  mill-pond, where you can row in the evenings, and hear the lads and lasses
  singing love songs. Then there are great quiet meadows, where the kine
  browse, where the air is so still that one can sleep at a thought. There are
  woods, too&mdash;≠ah! such woods&mdash;≠stretching up hill, and down dale, as
  green as spring can make them, with long avenues where men may ride; and,
  perhaps, at the heart of all, some old chateau, all hung with vines and
  creepers, where the peaches ripen on the walls and the fountain plashes all
  the summer&rsquo;s day. Bah! I can hardly bear to think on it, &rsquo;tis so
  dear and home-like;&rdquo; and I turned away suddenly, for I felt my voice
  catch in my throat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What hills are yonder?&rdquo; I asked abruptly, to hide my
  feelings.</p>

  <p>Anne looked up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The hills beyond the little green ridge you mean?&rdquo; she says.
  &ldquo;That will be over by Eskdalemuir and the top of the Ettrick Water. I
  have heard my father speak often of them, for they say that many of the godly
  find shelter there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Many of the godly!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I turned round sharply, though what there was in the phrase to cause
  wonder I cannot see. She spoke but as she had heard the men of her house
  speak; yet the words fell strangely on my ears, for by a curious process of
  thinking I had already begun to separate the girl from the rest of the folk
  in the place, and look on her as something nearer in sympathy to myself.
  Faugh? that is not the way to put it. I mean that she had listened so much to
  my tales that I had all but come to look upon her as a countrywoman of
  mine.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you dull here, Anne?&rdquo; I asked, for I had come to use the
  familiar name, and she in turn would sometimes call me Jean&mdash;≠and very
  prettily it sat on her tongue. &ldquo;Do you never wish to go elsewhere and
  see the world?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I had scarce thought about the world
  at all. &rsquo;Tis a place I have little to do with, and I am content to
  dwell here forever, if it be God&rsquo;s will. But I should love to see your
  France, that you speak of.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This seemed truly a desire for gratifying which there was little chance;
  so I changed the subject of our converse, and asked her if she ever sang.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, I have learned to sing two or three songs, old ballads of the
  countryside, for though my father like it little, Henry takes a pleasure in
  hearing them. I will sing you one if you wish it.&rdquo; And when I bade her
  do so, she laid down her work, which she had taken up again, and broke into a
  curious plaintive melody. I cannot describe it. &rsquo;Twould be as easy to
  describe the singing of the wind in the tree-tops. It minded me, I cannot
  tell how, of a mountain burn, falling into pools and rippling over little
  shoals of gravel. Now &rsquo;twas full and strong, and now &rsquo;twas so
  eerie and wild that it was more like a curlew&rsquo;s note than any human
  thing. The story was about a knight who sailed to Norway on some king&rsquo;s
  errand and never returned, and of his lady who waited long days at home,
  weeping for him who should never come back to her. I did not understand it
  fully, for &rsquo;twas in an old patois of the country, but I could feel its
  beauty. When she had finished the tears stood in my eyes, and I thought of
  the friends I had left, whom I might see no more.</p>

  <p>But when I looked at her, to my amazement, there was no sign of feeling in
  her face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a song I have sung often,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I
  do not like it. &rsquo;Tis no better than the ringing of a bell at a
  funeral.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, wishing to make her cheerful, &ldquo;I will
  sing you a gay song of my own country. The folk dance to it on the Sunday
  nights at Rohaine, when blind Ren√© plays the fiddle.&rdquo; So I broke into
  the &ldquo;May song,&rdquo; with its lilting refrain.</p>

  <p>Anne listened intently, her face full of pleasure, and at the second verse
  she began to beat the tune with her foot. She, poor thing, had never danced,
  had never felt the ecstasy of motion; but since all mankind is alike in
  nature, her blood stirred at the tune. So I sang her another chanson, this
  time an old love ballad, and then again a war song. But by this time the
  darkness was growing around us, so we must needs re-enter the house; and as I
  followed I could hear her humming the choruses with a curious delight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So ho, Mistress Anne,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;you are not the
  little country mouse that I had thought you, but as full of spirit as a caged
  hawk. Faith, the town would make a brave lass of you, were you but
  there!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>From this hour I may date the beginning of the better
  understanding&mdash;≠I might almost call it friendship&mdash;≠between the two
  of us. She had been bred among moorland solitudes, and her sole companions
  had been solemn praying folk; yet, to my wonder, I found in her a nature
  loving gayety and mirth, songs and bright colors&mdash;≠a grace which her
  grave deportment did but the more set off. So she came soon to look at me
  with a kindly face, doing little acts of kindness every now and then in some
  way or other, which I took to be the return which she desired to make for my
  clumsy efforts to please her.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">VII.&mdash;A DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The days at Lindean dragged past, and the last traces of
  summer began to disappear from the face of the hills. The bent grew browner,
  the trees more ragged, and the torrent below more turgid and boisterous. Yet
  no word came from the hills, and, sooth to tell, we almost ceased to look for
  it. &rsquo;Twas not that we had forgotten the minister and Master Semple in
  their hiding, for the thought of them was often at hand to sadden me, and
  Anne, I must suppose, had many anxious meditations; but our life at Lindean
  was so peaceful and removed from any hint of violence that danger did not
  come before our minds in terrible colors. When the rain beat at night on the
  window, and the wind howled round the house, then our hearts would smite us
  for living in comfort when our friends were suffering the furious weather.
  But when the glorious sun-lit morning had come, and we looked over the
  landscape, scarce free from the magic of dawn, then we counted it no hardship
  to be on the hills. And rain came so seldom during that time, and the sun so
  often, that the rigor of the hill-life did not appal us.</p>

  <p>This may account for the way in which the exiles slipped from our memories
  for the greater part of the day. For myself I say nothing&mdash;≠&rsquo;twas
  but natural; but from Anne I must confess that I expected a greater show of
  sorrow. To look at her you would say that she was burdened with an old grief,
  so serious was her face; but when she would talk, then you might see how
  little her heart was taken up with the troubles of her house and the care for
  her father and lover. The girl to me was a puzzle, which I gave up all
  attempting to solve. When I had first come to Lindean, lo! she was demure and
  full of filial affection, and tender to her lover. Now, when I expected to
  find her sorrowful and tearful at all times, I found her quiet indeed, but
  instinct with a passion for beauty and pleasure and all the joys of life. Yet
  ever and anon she would take a fit of solemnity, and muse with her chin
  poised on her hand; and I doubt not that at such times she was thinking of
  her father and her lover in their manifold perils.</p>

  <p>One day the rain came again and made the turf plashy and sodden, and set
  the Lin roaring in his gorge. I had beguiled the morning by showing Anne the
  steps of dancing, and she had proved herself a ready pupil. To pleasure her I
  danced the sword-dance, which can only be done by those who have great
  dexterity of motion; and I think I may say that I acquitted myself well. The
  girl stood by in wonderment, looking at me with a pleasing mixture of
  surprise and delight. She had begun to look strangely at me of late. Every
  now and then when I lifted my head I would find her great eyes resting on me,
  and at my first glance she would withdraw them. They were strange
  eyes&mdash;≠a mingling of the fawn and the tiger.</p>

  <p>As I have said, in a little time she had acquired some considerable skill,
  and moved as gracefully as though she had learned it from her childhood,
  while I whistled bars of an old dancing tune. She had a little maid who
  attended her,&mdash;≠Eff she called her,&mdash;≠and the girl stood by to
  watch while Anne did my bidding. Then when we were all wearied of the sport,
  I fell to thinking of some other play, and could find none. &rsquo;Twas as
  dull as ditch-water, till the child Eff, by a good chance, spoke of fishing.
  She could get her father&rsquo;s rod and hooks, she said, for he never used
  them now; and I might try my luck in the Lin Water. There were good trout
  there, it seemed, and the choice time of taking them was in the autumn
  floods.</p>

  <p>Now I have ever been something of a fisherman, for many an hour have I
  spent by the big fish pond at Rohaine. So I got the tackle of Eff&rsquo;s
  father&mdash;≠rude enough it was in all conscience&mdash;≠and in the early
  afternoon I set out to the sport. Below the house and beyond the wood the Lin
  foams in a deep gully, falling over horrid cascades into great churning
  pools, or diving beneath the narrow rocks. But above the ravine there is a
  sudden change. The stream flows equably through a flat moor in sedgy deeps
  and bright shimmering streams. Thither I purposed to go, for I am no lover of
  the awesome black caldrons, which call to a man&rsquo;s mind visions of
  drowned bodies and pits which have no ending. On the moor with the wind
  blowing about one &rsquo;twas a pleasure to be, but faugh! no multitude of
  fish was worth an hour in that dismal chasm.</p>

  <p>I had not great success, and little wonder, for my leisurely ways were ill
  suited for the alert mountain fish. My time was spent in meditating on many
  things, but most of all on the strange case in which I found myself. For in
  truth my position was an odd one as ever man was in.</p>

  <p>Here was I bound by my word of honor to bide in the house and protect its
  inmates till that indefinite time when its master might return. There was no
  fear of money, for the minister had come of a good stock, and had more gear
  than is usual with one of his class. But &rsquo;twas an evil thing to look
  forward to&mdash;≠to spend my days in a lonely manse, and wait the end of a
  persecution which showed no signs of ending.</p>

  <p>But the mere discomfort was nothing had it not been for two delicate
  scruples which came to torment me. <i>Imprimis</i>, &rsquo;twas more than any
  man of honor could do to dwell in warmth and plenty, while his entertainers
  were languishing for lack of food or shivering with cold in the hags and
  holes of the mountains. I am a man tolerably hardened by war and travel, yet
  I could never abide to lie in bed on a stormy night or to eat my food of a
  sharp morning when I thought of the old man dying, it might be, unsheltered
  and forlorn. <i>Item</i>, there was the matter of the girl; and I cannot tell
  how heavy the task had come to lie on my shoulders. I had taken the trust of
  one whom I thought to be a staid country lass, and lo! I had found her as
  full of human passion as any lady of the court. &rsquo;Twas like some groom
  who offers to break a horse, and finds it too stiff in temper. I had striven
  to do my duty toward her and make her life less wearisome, and I had
  succeeded all too well. For I marked that in the days just past she had come
  to regard me with eyes too kindly by half. When I caught her unawares, and
  saw the curious look on her face, I could have bitten my tongue out with
  regret, for I saw the chasm to whose brink I had led her. I will take my oath
  there was no thought of guile in the maid, for she was as innocent as a
  child; but &rsquo;tis such who are oftentimes the very devil, since their
  inexperience adds an edge to their folly.</p>

  <p>Thinking such thoughts, I fished up the Lin Water till the afternoon was
  all but past, and the sunset began to glimmer in the bog-pools. My mind was a
  whirl of emotions, and no plan or order could I conceive. But&mdash;≠and this
  one thing I have often marked, that the weather curiously affected my
  temper&mdash;≠the soft evening light brought with it a calm which eased me in
  the conflict. &rsquo;Tis hard to wrangle in spirit when the west is a flare
  of crimson, and later when each blue hill stands out sharp against the yellow
  sky. My way led through the great pine wood above the Lin gorge, thence over
  a short spit of heath to the hill path and the ordered shrubbery of the
  manse. &rsquo;Twas fine to see the tree stems stand out red against the
  gathering darkness, while their thick evergreen heads were blazing like
  flambeaux. A startled owl drove past, wavering among the trunks. The air was
  so still that the light and color seemed all but audible, and indeed the
  distant rumble of the falling stream seemed the interpretation to the ears of
  the vision which the eyes beheld. I love such sights, and &rsquo;tis rarely
  enough that we see them in France, for it takes a stormy upland country to
  show to its full the sinking of the sun. The heath with its dead heather,
  when I came on it, seemed alight, as happens in March, so I have heard, when
  the shepherds burn the mountain grass. But in the manse garden was the
  choicest sight, for there the fading light seemed drawn to a point and
  blazing on the low bushes and coarse lawns. Each window in the house glowed
  like a jewel, but&mdash;≠mark the wonder&mdash;≠when I gazed over the country
  there was no view to be seen, but only a slowly creeping darkness.</p>

  <p>&rsquo;Twas an eerie sight, and beautiful beyond telling. It awed me, and
  yet filled me with a great desire to see it to the full. So I did not enter
  the house, but turned my steps round by the back to gain the higher ground,
  for the manse was built on a slope. I loitered past the side window, and
  gained the place I had chosen; but I did not bide long, for soon the show was
  gone, and only a chill autumn dusk left behind. So I made to enter the house,
  when I noticed a light as of firelight dancing in the back window. Now, I had
  never been in that room before, so what must I do in my idle curiosity but go
  peeping there.</p>

  <p>The room was wide and unfurnished, with a fire blazing on the hearth. But
  what held me amazed were the figures on the floor. Anne, with her skirts
  kilted, stood erect and agile as if about to dance. The girl Eff sat by the
  fireplace, humming some light measure. The ruddy light bathed the floor and
  walls and made all distinct as noonday.</p>

  <p>&rsquo;Twas as I had guessed. In a trice her feet began to move, and soon
  she was in the middle of the first dance I had taught her, while <i>la
  petite</i> Eff sang the tune in her clear, low voice. I have seen many
  dancers, great ladies and country dames, village lasses and burgher wives,
  gypsies and wantons, but, by my honor, I never saw one dance like Anne. Her
  body moved as if by one impulse with her feet. Now she would bend like a
  willow, and now whirl like the leaves of the wood in an autumn gale. She was
  dressed, as was her wont, in sober brown, but sackcloth could not have
  concealed the grace of her form. The firelight danced and leaped in her hair,
  for her face was turned from me; and &rsquo;twas fine to see the snow of her
  neck islanded among the waves of brown tresses. With a sudden swift dart she
  turned her face to the window, and had I not been well screened by the
  shadows, I fear I should have been observed. But such a sight as her face I
  never hope to see again. The solemnity was gone, and &rsquo;twas all radiant
  with youth and life. Her eyes shone like twin stars, the even brown of her
  cheeks was flushed with firelight, and her throat and bosom heaved with the
  excitement of the dance. Then she stopped exhausted, smiled on Eff, who sat
  like a cinder-witch all the while, and smoothed the hair from her brow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have I done it well?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As weel as he did it himsel&rsquo;,&rdquo; the child answered.
  &ldquo;Eh, but you twae would make a bonny pair.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I turned away abruptly and crept back to the garden path, my heart sinking
  within me, and a feeling of guilt in my soul. I was angry at myself for
  eavesdropping, angry and ashamed. But a great dread came on me as I thought
  of the girl, this firebrand, who had been trusted to my keeping. Lackaday for
  the peace of mind of a man who has to see to a maid who could dance in this
  fashion, with her father and lover in the cold hills! And always I called to
  mind that I had been her teacher, and that my lessons, begun as a harmless
  sport to pass the time, were like to breed an overmastering passion. <i>Mon
  Dieu!</i> I was like the man in the Eastern tale who had raised a spirit
  which he was powerless to control.</p>

  <p>And just then, as if to point my meditations, I heard the cry of a plover
  from the moor behind, and a plaff of the chill night-wind blew in my
  face.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">VIII.&mdash;HOW I SET THE SIGNAL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When I set out to write this history in the English tongue,
  that none of my own house might read it, I did not know the hard task that
  lay before me. For if I were writing it in my own language, I could tell the
  niceties of my feelings in a way which is impossible for me in any other.
  And, indeed, to make my conduct intelligible, I should forthwith fall to
  telling each shade of motive and impulse which came to harass my mind. But I
  am little skilled in this work, so I must needs recount only the landmarks of
  my life, or I should never reach the end.</p>

  <p>I slept ill that night, and at earliest daylight was awake and dressing.
  The full gravity of the case was open to me now, and you may guess that my
  mind was no easy one. I went down to the sitting room, where the remains of
  the last night&rsquo;s supper still lay on the table. The white morning light
  made all things clear and obtrusive, and I remember wishing that the lamp was
  lit again and the shutters closed. But in a trice all meditations were cast
  to the winds, for I heard the door at the back of the house flung violently
  open and the sound of a man&rsquo;s feet on the kitchen floor.</p>

  <p>I knew that I was the only one awake in the house, so with much haste I
  passed out of the room to ascertain who the visitor might be. In the center
  of the back room stood a great swart man, shaking the rain from his clothes
  and hair, and waiting like one about to give some message. When he saw me he
  took a step forward, scanned me closely, and then waited my question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who in the devil&rsquo;s name are you?&rdquo; I asked angrily, for
  I was half amazed and half startled by his sudden advent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the Lord&rsquo;s name I am Andrew Gibb,&rdquo; he responded
  solemnly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s your errand?&rdquo; I asked further.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bide a wee and you&rsquo;ll hear. You&rsquo;ll be the foreigner
  whae stops at the manse the noo?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; I said shortly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thae twae sants, Maister Lambert and Maister Semple, &rsquo;ill
  ha&rsquo;e made some kind o&rsquo; covenant wi&rsquo; you? At ony rate, hear
  my news and dae your best. Their hidy-hole at the heid o&rsquo; the Stark
  Water&rsquo;s been betrayed, and unless they get warning it&rsquo;ll be
  little you&rsquo;ll hear mair o&rsquo; them. I&rsquo;ve aye been their
  freend, so I cam&rsquo; here to do my pairt by them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you one of the hill-men?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Na, na! God forbid! I&rsquo;m a douce, quiet-leevin&rsquo; man, and
  I&rsquo;d see the Kirk rummle aboot their lugs ere I&rsquo;d stir my shanks
  frae my ain fireside. But I&rsquo;m behauden to the minister for the life
  o&rsquo; my bairn, whilk is ower lang a story for ye to hear; and to help him
  I would rin frae Maidenkirk to Berwick. So I&rsquo;ve aye made it my wark to
  pick up ony word o&rsquo; scaith that was comin&rsquo; to him, and
  that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here the day. Ye&rsquo;ve heard my news richt,
  ye&rsquo;re shure?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard your news. Will you take any food before you
  leave?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Na; I maun be off to be back in time for the kye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, good-day to you, Andrew Gibb,&rdquo; I said, and in a minute
  the man was gone.</p>

  <p>Now, here I must tell what I omitted to tell in a former place&mdash;≠that
  when the exiles took to the hills they bade me, if I heard any word of danger
  to their hiding-place, to go by a certain path, which they pointed out, to a
  certain place, and there overturn a little cairn of stones. This was to be a
  signal to them for instant movement. I knew nothing of the place of their
  retreat, and for this reason could swear on my oath with an easy conscience;
  but this scrap of enlightenment I had, a scrap of momentous import for both
  life and death.</p>

  <p>I turned back to the parlor in a fine confusion of mind. By some means or
  other the task which was now before me had come to seem singularly
  disagreeable. The thought of my entertainers&mdash;≠I am ashamed to write
  it&mdash;≠was a bitter thought. I had acquired a reasonless dislike to them.
  What cause had they, I asked, to be crouching in hill-caves and first getting
  honest gentlemen into delicate and difficult positions, and then troubling
  them with dangerous errands. Then there was the constant vision of the maid
  to vex me. This was the sorest point of all. For, though I blush to own it,
  the sight of her was not altogether unpleasing to me; nay, to put it
  positively, I had come almost to feel an affection for her. She was so white
  and red and golden, all light and gravity, with the shape of a princess, the
  mien of a goddess, and, for all I knew the heart of a dancing-girl. She
  carried with her the air of comfort and gayety, and the very thought of her
  made me shrink from the dark moors and ill-boding errand as from the
  leprosy.</p>

  <p>There is in every man a latent will, apart altogether from that which he
  uses in common life, which is apt at times to assert itself when he least
  expects it. Such was my honor, for lo! I found myself compelled by an
  inexorable force to set about the performance of my duty. I take no credit
  for it, since I was only half willing, my grosser inclination being all
  against it. But something bade me do it, calling me poltroon, coward,
  traitor, if I refused; so ere I left the kitchen I had come to a fixed
  decision.</p>

  <p>To my wonder, at the staircase foot I met Anne, dressed, but with her hair
  all in disorder. I stood booted and cloaked and equipped for the journey, and
  at the sight of me her face filled with surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where away so early, John?&rdquo; says she.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where away so early, Mistress Anne?&rdquo; said I.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, I slept ill, and came down to get the morning air.&rdquo; I
  noted that her eyes were dull and restless, and I do believe that the poor
  maid had had a sorry night of it. A sharp fear at my heart told me the
  cause.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; I said sullenly, &ldquo;I am going on a hard errand,
  and I entreat you to keep out of harm&rsquo;s way till I return.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what is your errand, pray?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing less than to save the lives of your father and your lover.
  I have had word from a secret source of a great danger which overhangs them,
  and by God&rsquo;s help I would remove it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At my word a light, half angry and half pathetic, came to her eyes. It
  passed like a sungleam, and in its place was left an expression of cold
  distaste.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then God prosper you,&rdquo; she said, in a formal tone, and with a
  whisk of her skirts she was gone.</p>

  <p>I strode out into the open with my heart the battlefield of a myriad
  contending passions.</p>

  <p>I reached the hill, overturned the cairn, and set out on my homeward way,
  hardly giving but one thought to the purport of my errand or the two
  fugitives whom it was my mission to save, so filled was my mind with my own
  trouble. The road home was long and arduous; and more, I had to creep often
  like an adder lest I should be spied and traced by some chance dragoon. The
  weather was dull and cold, and a slight snow, the first token of winter,
  sprinkled the moor. The heather was wet, the long rushes dripped and
  shivered, and in the little trenches the peat-water lay black as ink. A smell
  of damp hung over all things, an odor of rotten-leaves and soaked earth. The
  heavy mist rolled in volumes close to the ground and choked me as I bent low.
  Every little while I stumbled into a bog, and foully bedaubed my clothes. I
  think that I must have strayed a little from the straight path, for I took
  near twice as long to return as to go. A swollen stream delayed me, for I had
  to traverse its bank for a mile ere I could cross.</p>

  <p>In truth, I cannot put down on paper my full loathing of the place. I had
  hated the moors on my first day&rsquo;s journey, but now I hated them with a
  tenfold hatred. For each whiff of sodden air, each spit of chill rain brought
  back to my mind all the difficulty of my present state. Then I had always the
  vision of Anne sitting at home by the fire, warm, clean, and dainty, the very
  counter of the foul morasses in which I labored, and where the men I had
  striven to rescue were thought to lie hidden. My loathing was so great that I
  could scarce find it in my heart to travel the weary miles to the manse,
  every step being taken solely on the fear of remaining behind. To make it
  worse, there would come to vex me old airs of France, airs of childhood and
  my adventurous youth, fraught for me with memories of gay nights and brave
  friends. I own that I could have wept to think of them and find myself all
  the while in this inhospitable desert.</p>

  <p>&rsquo;Twould be near mid-day, I think, when I came to the manse door,
  glad that my journey was ended. Anne let me in, and in a moment all was
  changed. The fire crackled in the room, and the light danced on the great
  volumes on the shelves. The gray winter was shut out and a tranquil summer
  reigned within. Anne, like a Lent lily, so fair was she, sat sewing by the
  hearth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are returned,&rdquo; she said coldly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am returned,&rdquo; I said severely, for her callousness to the
  danger of her father was awful to witness, though in my heart of hearts I
  could not have wished it otherwise. As she sat there, with her white arms
  moving athwart her lap, and her hair tossed over her shoulders, I could have
  clasped her to my heart. Nay, I had almost done so, had I not gripped my
  chair, and sat with pale face and dazed eyes till the fit had passed. I have
  told you ere now how my feelings toward Anne had changed from interest to
  something not unlike a passionate love. It had been a thing of secret growth,
  and I scarcely knew it till I found myself in the midst of it. I tried to
  smother it hourly, when my better nature was in the ascendant, and hourly I
  was overthrown in the contest I fought against terrible odds. &rsquo;Twas not
  hard to see from her longing eyes and timorous conduct that to her I was the
  greater half of the world. I had but to call to her and she would come. And
  yet&mdash;≠God knows how I stifled that cry.</p>

  <p>At length I rose and strode out into the garden to cool my burning head.
  The sleet was even grateful to me, and I bared my brow till hair and skin
  were wet with the rain. Down by the rows of birch trees I walked, past the
  rough ground where the pot-herbs were grown, till I came to the shady green
  lawn. Up and down it I passed, striving hard with my honor and my love,
  fighting that battle which all must fight some time or other in their lives
  and be victorious or vanquished forever.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, to my wonder, I saw a face looking at me from beneath a tuft of
  elderberry.</p>

  <p>I drew back, looked again, and at the second glance I recognized it.
  &rsquo;Twas the face of Master Henry Semple of Clachlands&mdash;≠and the
  hills.</p>

  <p>&rsquo;Twas liker the face of a wild goat than a man. The thin features
  stood out so strongly that all the rest seemed to fall back from them. The
  long, ragged growth of hair on lip and chin, and the dirt on his cheeks, made
  him unlike my friend of the past. But the memorable change was in his eyes,
  which glowed large and lustrous, with the whites greatly extended, and all
  tinged with a yellow hue. Fear and privation had done their work, and before
  me stood their finished product.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Heavens, Henry! What brings you here, and how have you
  fared?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stared at me without replying, which I noted as curious.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is Anne?&rdquo; he asked huskily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is in the house, well and unscathed. Shall I call her to
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, for God&rsquo;s sake, nay! I am no pretty sight for a young
  maid. You say she is well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, very well. But how is the minister?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alas, he is all but gone. The chill has entered his bones, and even
  now he may be passing. The child will soon be an orphan.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I am no worse than the others on whom the Lord&rsquo;s hand is
  laid. There is a ringing in my head and a pain at my heart, but I am still
  hale and fit to testify to the truth. Oh, man, &lsquo;twill ill befa&rsquo;
  those in the day of judgment who eat the bread of idleness and dwell in peace
  in thae weary times.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come into the house; or nay, I will fetch you food and
  clothing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, bring nought for me. I would rather live in rags and sup on a
  crust than be habited in purple and fare sumptuously. I ask ye but one thing:
  let the maid walk in the garden that I may see her. And, oh, man! I thank ye
  for your kindness to me and mine. I pray the Lord ilka night to think on ye
  here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I could not trust myself to speak.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will do as you wish,&rdquo; I said, and without another word set
  off sharply for the house.</p>

  <p>I entered the sitting room wearily, and flung myself on a chair. Anne sat
  sewing as before. She started as I entered, and I saw the color rise to her
  cheeks and brow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are pale, my dear,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;the day is none so
  bad, and &rsquo;twould do you no ill to walk round the garden to the gate. I
  have just been there, and, would you believe it, the grass is still wondrous
  green.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She rose demurely and obediently as if my word were the law of her
  life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pray bring me a sprig of ivy from the gate-side,&rdquo; I cried
  after her, laughing, &ldquo;to show me that you have been there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I sat and kicked my heels till her return in a miserable state of
  impatience. I could not have refused to let the man see his own betrothed,
  but God only knew what desperate act he might do. He might spring out and
  clasp her in his arms; she, I knew, had not a shred of affection left for
  him; she would be cold and resentful; he would suspect, and then&mdash;≠what
  an end there might be to it all! I longed to hear the sound of her returning
  footsteps.</p>

  <p>She came in soon, and sat down in her wonted chair by the fire.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your ivy, John,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
  raw and chilly in the garden, and I love the fireside better.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;she has not seen Master
  Semple.&rdquo; Now I could not suffer him to depart without meeting him
  again, partly out of pity for the man, partly to assure my own mind that no
  harm would come of it. So I feigned an errand and went out.</p>

  <p>I found him, as I guessed, still in the elder-bush, a tenfold stranger
  sight than before. His eyes burned uncannily. His thin cheeks seemed almost
  transparent with the tension of the bones, and he chewed his lips
  unceasingly. At the sight of me he came out and stood before me, as wild a
  figure as I ever hope to see&mdash;≠clothes in tatters, hair unkempt, and
  skin all foul with the dirt of the moors. His back was bowed, and his knees
  seemed to have lost all strength, for they tottered against one another. I
  prayed that his sufferings might not have turned him mad.</p>

  <p>At the first word he spake I was convinced of it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have seen her, I have seen her!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;She is
  more fair than a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams
  from Lebanon. Oh, I have dreamed of her by night among the hills, and seen
  her face close to me and tried to catch it, but &rsquo;twas gone. Oh, man,
  John, get down on your knees, and pray to God to make you worthy to have the
  charge of such a treasure. Had the Lord not foreordained that she should me
  mine, I should ne&rsquo;er have lifted up my eyes to her, for who am
  I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, man,&rdquo; I broke in, &ldquo;tell me where
  you are going, and be about it quick, for you may be in instant
  danger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you are right. I must be gone. I have
  seen enough. I maun away to the deserts and caves of the rocks, and it may be
  lang, lang ere I come back. But my love winna forget me. Na, na; the Lord
  hath appointed unto me that I shall sit at his right hand on the last, the
  great day, and she shall be by my side. For oh, she is the only one of her
  mother; she is the choice one of her that bare her; the daughters saw her and
  blessed her; yea, the queens and concubines, and they praised her.&rdquo; And
  with some like gibberish from the Scriptures he disappeared through the
  bushes, and next minute I saw him running along the moor toward the
  hills.</p>

  <p>These were no love-sick ravings, but the wild cries of a madman, one whose
  reason had gone forever. I walked back slowly to the house. It seemed almost
  profane to think of Anne, so wholesome and sane, in the same thought as this
  foul idiot; and yet this man had been once as whole in mind and body as
  myself; he had suffered in a valiant cause; and I was bound to him by the
  strongest of all bonds&mdash;≠my plighted word. I groaned inwardly as I shut
  the house-door behind me and entered into the arena of my struggles.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">IX.&mdash;I COMMUNE WITH MYSELF</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Twas late afternoon when I re-entered, and ere supper was
  past &rsquo;twas time to retire for the night. The tension of these hours I
  still look back on as something altogether dreadful. Anne was quiet and
  gentle, unconscious of what had happened, yet with the fire of passion, I
  knew too well, burning in her heart. I was ill, restless, and abrupt, scarce
  able to speak lest I should betray my thoughts and show the war that raged in
  my breast.</p>

  <p>I made some excuse for retiring early, bidding her good-night with as
  nonchalant an air as I could muster. The door of my bedroom I locked behind
  me, and I was alone in the darkened room to fight out my battles with
  myself.</p>

  <p>I ask you if you can conceive any gentleman and man of honor in a more
  hazardous case. Whenever I tried to think on it, a mist came over my brain,
  and I could get little but unmeaning fantasies. I must either go or stay. So
  much was clear.</p>

  <p>If I stayed&mdash;≠well, &rsquo;twas the Devil&rsquo;s own work that was
  cut for me. There was no sign of the violence of the persecution abating. It
  might be many months, nay years, before the minister and Master Semple might
  return. If they came back no more, and I had sure tidings of their death,
  then indeed I might marry Anne. But &rsquo;twas so hazardous an uncertainty
  that I rejected it at once. No man could dwell with one whom he loved heart
  and soul so long a time on such uncertain chances and yet keep his honor. Had
  the maid been dull and passive, or had I been sluggish in blood, then there
  might have been hope. But we were both quick as the summer&rsquo;s
  lightning.</p>

  <p>If they came back, was not the fate of the girl more hard than words could
  tell? The minister in all likelihood would already have gone the way of all
  the earth; and she, poor lass, would be left to the care of a madman for whom
  she had no spark of liking. I pictured her melancholy future. Her pure body
  subject to the embraces of a loathsome fanatic, her delicate love of the joys
  of life all subdued to his harsh creed. Oh, God! I swore that I could not
  endure it. Her face, so rounded and lovely, would grow pinched and white, her
  eyes would lose all their luster, her hair would not cluster lovingly about
  her neck, her lithe grace would be gone, her footsteps would be heavy and
  sad. He would rave his unmeaning gibberish in her ears, would ill-treat her,
  it might be; in any case would be a perpetual sorrow to her heart. &ldquo;Oh,
  Anne,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;though I be damned for it, I will save you from
  this!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>If I left the place at once and forever, then indeed my honor would be
  kept, but yet not all; for my plighted word&mdash;≠where would it be? I had
  sworn that come what may I should stand by the maid and protect her against
  what evil might come to the house. Now I was thinking of fleeing from my post
  like a coward, and all because the girl&rsquo;s eyes were too bright for my
  weak resolution. When her lover returned, if he ever came, what story would
  she have to tell? This, without a doubt: &ldquo;The man whom you left has
  gone, fled like a thief in the night, for what reason I know not.&rdquo; For
  though I knew well that she would divine the real cause of my action, I could
  not suppose that she would tell it, for thereby she would cast grave
  suspicion upon herself. So there would I be, a perjured traitor, a false
  friend in the eyes of those who had trusted me.</p>

  <p>But more, the times were violent, Clachlands and its soldiery were not far
  off, and once they learned that the girl was unprotected no man knew what
  evil might follow. You may imagine how bitter this thought was to me, the
  thought of leaving my love in the midst of terrible dangers. Nay, more; a
  selfish consideration weighed not a little with me. The winter had all but
  come; the storms of this black land I dreaded like one born and bred in the
  South; I knew nothing of my future course; I was poor, bare, and friendless.
  The manse was a haven of shelter. Without it I should be even as the two
  exiles in the hills. The cold was hard to endure; I dearly loved warmth and
  comfort; the moors were as fearful to me as the deserts of Muscovy.</p>

  <p>One course remained. Anne had money; this much I knew. She loved me, and
  would obey my will in all things; of this I was certain. What hindered me to
  take her to France, the land of mirth and all pleasant things, and leave the
  North and its wild folk behind forever? With money we could travel
  expeditiously. Once in my own land perchance I might find some way to repair
  my fortunes, for a fair wife is a wonderous incentive. There beneath soft
  skies, in the mellow sunshine, among a cheerful people, she would find the
  life which she loved best. What deterred me? Nothing but a meaningless vow
  and some antiquated scruples. But I would be really keeping my word, I
  reasoned casuistically with myself, for I had sworn to take care of Anne, and
  what way so good as to take her to my own land where she would be far from
  the reach of fanatic or dragoon? And this was my serious thought,
  <i>comprenez bien</i>! I set it down as a sign of the state to which I had
  come, that I was convinced by my own quibbling. I pictured to myself what I
  should do. I would find her at breakfast in the morning. &ldquo;Anne,&rdquo;
  I would say, &ldquo;I love you dearly; may I think that you love me
  likewise?&rdquo; I could fancy her eager, passionate reply, and
  then&mdash;&mdash;≠ I almost felt the breath of her kisses on my cheek and
  the touch of her soft arms on my neck.</p>

  <p>Some impulse led me to open the casement and look forth into the windy,
  inscrutable night. A thin rain distilled on the earth, and the coolness was
  refreshing to my hot face. The garden was black, and the bushes were marked
  by an increased depth of darkness. But on the grass to the left I saw a long
  shaft of light, the reflection from some lit window of the house. I passed
  rapidly in thought over the various rooms there, and with a start came to an
  end. Without a doubt &rsquo;twas Anne&rsquo;s sleeping room. What did the
  lass with a light, for &rsquo;twas near midnight? I did not hesitate about
  the cause, and &rsquo;twas one which inflamed my love an hundredfold. She was
  sleepless, love-sick maybe (such is the vanity of man). Maybe even now my
  name was the one on her lips, and my image the foremost in her mind. My
  finger-tips tingled, as the blood surged into them; and I am not ashamed to
  say that my eyes were not tearless. Could I ever leave my love for some
  tawdry honor? <i>Mille tonneres!</i> the thing was not to be dreamed of. I
  blamed myself for having once admitted the thought.</p>

  <p>My decision was taken, and, as was always my way, I felt somewhat easier.
  I was weary, so I cast myself down upon the bed without undressing, and fell
  into a profound sleep.</p>

  <p>How long I slept I cannot tell, but in that brief period of
  unconsciousness I seemed to be living ages. I saw my past life all inverted
  as &rsquo;twere; for my first sight was the horror of the moors. Quentin
  Kennedy, and the quarrel and the black desolation which I had undergone. I
  went through it all again, vividly, acutely. Then it passed, and I had my
  manhood in France before my eyes. And curiously enough, &rsquo;twas not
  alone, but confused with my childhood and youth. I was an experienced man of
  the world, versed in warfare and love, taverns and brawls, and yet not one
  whit jaded, but fresh and hopeful and boylike. &rsquo;Twas a very pleasing
  feeling. I was master of myself. I had all my self-respect. I was a man of
  unblemished honor, undoubted valor. Then by an odd trick of memory all kinds
  of associations became linked with it. The old sights and sounds of Rohaine:
  cocks crowing in the morning; the smell of hay and almond-blossom, roses and
  summer lilies; the sight of green leaves, of the fish leaping in the river;
  the plash of the boat&rsquo;s oars among the water-weeds&mdash;≠all the
  sensations of childhood came back with extraordinary clarity. I heard my
  mother&rsquo;s grave, tender speech bidding us children back from play, or
  soothing one when he hurt himself. I could almost believe that my
  father&rsquo;s strong voice was ringing in my ear, when he would tell stories
  of the chase and battle, or sing ballads of long ago, or bid us go to the
  devil if we pleased, but go like gentlemen. &rsquo;Twas a piece of sound
  philosophy, and often had it been before me in Paris, when I shrank from
  nothing save where my honor as a gentleman was threatened. In that dream the
  old saying came on me with curious force. I felt it to be a fine motto for
  life, and I was exulting in my heart that &rsquo;twas mine, and that I had
  never stained the fair fame of my house.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, with a start I seemed to wake to the consciousness that
  &rsquo;twas mine no more. Still dreaming, I was aware that I had deceived a
  lover, and stolen his mistress and made her my bride. I have never felt such
  acute anguish as I did in that sleep when the thought came upon me. I felt
  nothing more of pride. All things had left me. My self-respect was gone like
  a ragged cloak. All the old, dear life was shut out from me by a huge
  barrier. Comfortable, rich, loving, and beloved, I was yet in the very jaws
  of Hell. I felt myself biting out my tongue in my despair. My brain was on
  fire with sheer and awful regret. I cursed the day when I had been tempted
  and fallen.</p>

  <p>And then, even while I dreamed, another sight came to my eyes&mdash;≠the
  face of a lady, young, noble, with eyes like the Blessed Mother. In my youth
  I had laid my life at the feet of a girl, and I was in hopes of making her my
  wife. But Cecilia was too fair for this earth, and I scarcely dared to look
  upon her she seemed so saint-like. When she died in the Forest of Arnay,
  killed by a fall from her horse, &rsquo;twas I who carried her to her home,
  and since that day her face was never far distant from my memory. I cherished
  the image as my dearest possession, and oftentimes when I would have embarked
  upon some madness I refrained, fearing the reproof of those grave eyes. But
  now this was all gone. My earthy passion had driven out my old love; all
  memories were rapt from me save that of the sordid present.</p>

  <p>The very violence of my feeling awoke me, and I found myself sitting up in
  bed with a mouthful of blood. Sure enough, I had gnawed my tongue till a red
  froth was over my lips. My heart was beating like a windmill in a high gale,
  and a deadly sickness of mind oppressed me. &rsquo;Twas some minutes before I
  could think; and then&mdash;≠oh, joy! the relief! I had not yet taken the
  step irremediable. The revulsion, the sudden ecstasy drove in a trice my
  former resolution into thinnest air.</p>

  <p>I looked out of the window. &rsquo;Twas dawn, misty and wet. Thank God, I
  was still in the land of the living, still free to make my life. The tangible
  room, half lit by morning, gave me a promise of reality after the pageant of
  the dream. My path was clear before me, clear and straight as an arrow; and
  yet even now I felt a dread of my passion overcoming my resolve, and was in a
  great haste to have done with it all. My scruples about my course were all
  gone. I would be breaking my oath, &rsquo;twas true, in leaving the maid, but
  keeping it in the better way. The thought of the dangers to which she would
  be exposed stabbed me like a dart. It had almost overcome me. &ldquo;But
  honor is more than life or love,&rdquo; I said, as I set my teeth with stern
  purpose.</p>

  <p>Yet, though all my soul was steeled into resolution, there was no ray of
  hope in my heart&mdash;≠nothing but a dead, bleak outlook, a land of moors
  and rain, an empty purse and an aimless journey.</p>

  <p>I had come to the house a beggar scarce two months before. I must now go
  as I had come, not free and careless as then, but bursting shackles of triple
  brass. My old ragged garments, which I had discarded on the day after my
  arrival, lay on a chair, neatly folded by Anne&rsquo;s deft hand. It behooved
  me to take no more away than that which I had brought, so I must needs clothe
  myself in these poor remnants of finery, thin and mud-stained, and filled
  with many rents.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">X.&mdash;OF MY DEPARTURE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I passed through the kitchen out to the stable, marking as I
  went that the breakfast was ready laid in the sitting room. There I saddled
  Saladin, grown sleek by fat living, and rolling his great eyes at me
  wonderingly. I tested the joinings, buckled the girth tight, and led him
  round to the front of the house, where I tethered him to a tree and entered
  the door.</p>

  <p>A savory smell of hot meats came from the room and a bright wood fire
  drove away the grayness of the morning. Anne stood by the table, slicing a
  loaf and looking ever and anon to the entrance. Her face was pale as if with
  sleeplessness and weeping. Her hair was not so daintily arranged as was her
  wont. It seemed almost as if she had augured the future. A strange
  catch&mdash;≠coming as such songs do from nowhere and meaning
  nothing&mdash;≠ran constantly in my head. &lsquo;Twas one of Philippe
  Desportes&rsquo;, that very song which the Duke de Guise sang just before his
  death. So, as I entered, I found myself humming half unwittingly:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">&rsquo;"Nous verrons, bergËre Rosette,<br>
  Qui premier s&rsquo;en repentira.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Anne looked up as if startled at my coming, and when she saw my dress
  glanced fearfully at my face. It must have told her some tale, for a red
  flush mounted to her brow and abode there.</p>

  <p>I picked up a loaf from the table. &rsquo;Twas my one sacrifice to the
  gods of hospitality. &rsquo;Twould serve, I thought, for the first stage in
  my journey.</p>

  <p>Anne looked up at me with a kind of confused wonder. She laughed, but
  there was little mirth in her laughter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, what would you do with the loaf?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Do
  you seek to visit the widows and fatherless in their affliction?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said I gravely. &ldquo;I would but keep myself
  unspotted from the world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All merriment died out of her face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what would you do?&rdquo; she stammered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The time has come for me to leave, Mistress Anne. My horse is
  saddled at the door. I have been here long enough; ay, and too long. I thank
  you with all my heart for your kindness, and I would seek to repay it by
  ridding you of my company.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I fear I spoke harshly, but &rsquo;twas to hide my emotion, which bade
  fair to overpower me and ruin all.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, and why will you go?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Farewell, Anne,&rdquo; I said, looking at her fixedly, and I saw
  that she divined the reason.</p>

  <p>I turned on my heel, and went out from the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my love,&rdquo; she cried passionately, &ldquo;stay with me;
  stay, oh, stay!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her voice rang in my ear with honeyed sweetness, like that of the Sirens
  to Ulysses of old.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; she cried, as I flung open the house-door.</p>

  <p>I turned me round for one last look at her whom I loved better than life.
  She stood at the entrance to the room, with her arms outstretched and her
  white bosom heaving. Her eyes were filled with an utterable longing, which a
  man may see but once in his life&mdash;≠and well for him if he never sees it.
  Her lips were parted as if to call me back once more. But no word came; her
  presence was more powerful than any cry.</p>

  <p>I turned to the weather. A gray sky, a driving mist, and a chill piercing
  blast. The contrast was almost more than my resolution. An irresistible
  impulse seized me to fly to her arms, to enter the bright room again with
  her, and sell myself, body and soul, to the lady of my heart.</p>

  <p>My foot trembled to the step backward, my arms all but felt her weight,
  when that blind Fate which orders the ways of men intervened. Against my
  inclination and desire, bitterly, unwilling, I strode to my horse and flung
  myself on his back. I dared not look behind, but struck spurs into Saladin
  and rode out among the trees.</p>

  <p>A fierce north wind met me in the teeth, and piercing through my tatters,
  sent a shiver to my very heart.</p>

  <p>I cannot recall my thoughts during that ride: I seem not to have thought
  at all. All I know is that in about an hour there came into my mind, as from
  a voice, the words: &ldquo;Recreant! Fool!&rdquo; and I turned back.</p>
