<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<hr class="tenth">
<p><span class="aa">The</span> following pages give an account of
the establishment of the British Protectorate over New Guinea by
Commodore J. E. Erskine, A.D.C., in H.M.S. <i>Nelson</i>, in
November last, and also a description of the country and its
inhabitants. The <i>Nelson</i> and the other men-of-war cruised
along almost the whole of the southern coast, and as far eastward
as East Cape, visiting various centres of population, and staying
sufficiently long at each to enable most on board the vessels to
make themselves acquainted with the natives and their modes of
existence, and in this manner a great deal of New Guinea and its
people was seen.</p>
<p>The contents of this book were gathered by the writer in his
capacity of Special Commissioner to the <i>Sydney Morning
Herald</i>, and the only accredited newspaper correspondent
travelling with the expedition. They have already in another form
appeared in the columns of the newspaper mentioned, but it is
thought that the information given of the country and its
inhabitants, and the opportunities offered for white settlement,
should have more than a local circulation, and it is believed
that the book will prove not only interesting to the general
reader&mdash;in Great Britain as well as in Australia&mdash;but
also valuable to any one who contemplates visiting, or, when
settlement shall be permitted, trying his fortune in, this latest
and important addition to the British Empire.</p>
<p>Just before the departure of Commodore Erskine from Australia
for England, the writer received from him the following letter,
with reference to the publication of this book:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">"Government
House, Tasmania,<br>
"Saturday, Jan. 31.</div>
<br>
"<span class="aa">Dear Mr. Lyne</span>,<br>
<br>
"I write in answer to yours, which I received just as I was on
the point of departure from Sydney, to say that I am glad to hear
that you propose to republish the articles which have already
appeared in the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, giving an account
of our interesting cruise to New Guinea, as I feel sure they will
prove to be as interesting as I know them to be reliable.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:20%;">"Yours very
faithfully,</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">"<span class=

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><span class="uu">Arrival of H.M.S. "Nelson"
at Port Moresby&mdash;Assembling OF New Guinea
Chiefs&mdash;Presenting to the Head Chief an Emblem of
Authority&mdash;Proclamation of the Protectorate, and hoisting
the British Flag on Shore.</span></p>
<p><span class="aa">Commodore Erskine</span>, in H.M.S.
<i>Nelson</i>, arrived at Port Moresby on Sunday, the 2nd of
November, 1884, and the Union Jack now flies from the flagstaff
at the mission station, the proclamation of a British
Protectorate having been made with much ceremony on Thursday,
November 6. The <i>Nelson</i> entered Port Moresby at midday on
the Sunday, followed shortly afterwards by H.M.S.
<i>Espiegle</i>, from Cooktown, with Mr. H. M. Chester on board.
In the harbour at anchor were H.M.S. <i>Raven, Swinger</i>, and
<i>Harrier</i>, The last-named vessel had on board Mr.
Deputy-Commissioner Romilly, who, when the <i>Nelson</i> had come
to anchor, startled everybody by coming on board and informing
the Commodore that the ceremony of proclaiming the British
Protectorate and the hoisting of the British flag had been
already performed at Port Moresby. It appears that Mr. Romilly
received at Cooktown a telegram from Lord Derby, informing him of
the establishment of the Protectorate, and directing him to
notify that the settlement and purchase of land were forbidden.
Conceiving that this meant an instruction to proclaim the
Protectorate, and not knowing that Commodore Erskine was on his
way to New Guinea, Deputy-Commissioner Romilly, who came to Port
Moresby in H.M.S. <i>Harrier</i>, from Cooktown, made
arrangements for issuing a proclamation, and marking the event
with a ceremony. A proclamation was accordingly drawn up in
accordance with the telegram from Lord Derby, which described the
extent of the Protectorate as from the, Dutch boundary to East
Cape and the islands adjacent to it, eastward to Kosman Island;
and on the day after H.M.S. <i>Nelson</i> left Sydney, and in the
presence of the Port Moresby natives, and Captain Wilcox and
twenty blue-jackets from H.M.S. <i>Harrier</i> the proclamation
was read, the flag was hoisted, and the blue-jackets fired a
<i>feu-de-joie</i>.</p>
<p>It was evident, the moment the news was received on board
H.M.S. <i>Nelson</i>, that this ceremony could not be recognized
as authoritative or legal, and it was decided that it should be
explained to the natives as being only preliminary to the duly
authorized and proper ceremony to be performed by the Commodore,
whose preparations were therefore proceeded with as though
nothing had happened. It was the Commodore's desire that the
establishment of the Protectorate should be made known among as
many of the native tribes as it was possible to visit, and to
carry out that idea it was necessary that as many chiefs as could
be induced to come should be got together, and that this should
be done by H.M.S. <i>Nelson</i> visiting the various native
centres along the south coast, and then, with the assistance of
one or more of the other men-of-war, and the missionaries,
collecting from around those centres the chiefs of the different
tribes, and proclaiming the Protectorate in their presence. The
first and principal ceremony, it was arranged, should take place
at Port Moresby, and, accordingly, early on Tuesday, November 4,
H.M.S. <i>Espiegle</i> and <i>Raven</i> left their anchorage for
the purpose of collecting the chiefs of the branches of the Motu
tribe and the tribes adjacent within a certain distance east and
west of Port Moresby; the <i>Espiegle</i>, on board of which was
the Rev. J. Chalmers, going east as far as Round Head, and the
<i>Raven</i>, taking with her a native teacher, going west as far
as Redscar Bay. The other chiefs were to be brought in overland
by the Rev. W. G. Lawes. The <i>Espiegle</i> and <i>Raven</i>
returned on the Wednesday, both with chiefs on board, and the
former with two who had been at war with each other the day
before the vessel arrived, the quarrel having arisen through a
dispute in reference to payment for a girl who had been stolen,
and having ended with the killing and wounding of several natives
and the burning of a village. On the Wednesday afternoon the
chiefs and a number of other natives were brought on board H.M.S.
<i>Nelson</i>, and a grand assembly took place, with a feast for
the chiefs and an address from the Commodore, a presentation of
gifts attractive to the native eye, and the firing of some of the
ship's guns. The flags of various nations were hung over the
quarter-deck in the form of an awning, and the officers wore
frock coats and swords. Most of the chiefs were destitute of
clothing, the mop-like hair and foreheads of some of them being
bound round with bands of small shells, and the hair ornamented
with tufts of feathers. Two or three wore old shirts, and one Boe
Vagi, the chief of the Port Moresby natives, who was appointed by
the Commodore to be the head chief of the Motu tribe, was dressed
in a shirt, with a handkerchief round his loins, a red felt hat
on his head (the hat having been given to him by Mr. Chester when
the flag was hoisted in 1883), and some green leaves through the
lobe of his left ear. Evidently he had been attired specially for
the occasion, as his usual dress is as scanty as that of his
fellows. There were in all about fifty of the chiefs, most of
them being representatives of the Motu tribe; and, after having
been permitted to look round the ship, they were directed by the
missionaries, Messrs. Lawes and Chalmers, to seat themselves upon
the deck. Then a great tub of boiled rice, sweetened with brown
sugar, was brought on deck, and basins of this mixture were
handed round to the chiefs, who received them, and devoured the
rice with evident satisfaction. Ship biscuits were also served
out, and the scene presented by the feasting savages, and by the
grouping of the <i>Nelson's</i> officers and the parading of the
blue-jackets on the opposite side of the deck&mdash;so that a
photograph might be taken of the whole assembly&mdash;was
exceedingly interesting and picturesque.</p>
<p>When the feasting was over, Commodore Erskine, attended by Mr.
H. L. Warren, his secretary. Captain Bridge, of H.M.S.
<i>Espiegle</i>, Deputy-Commissioner Romilly, Mr. H. M. Chester,
and Messrs. Lawes and Chalmers, came upon deck, and the chief,
Boe Vagi, having been invited by Mr. Lawes to come forward, the
Commodore addressed him and his fellow-chiefs, and said:</p>
<p>"I have asked you to come on board to-day in order that I may
explain to you about the ceremony which will take place to-morrow
on shore. I have been sent to this place to notify and proclaim
that her Majesty the Queen has established a Protectorate over
the southern shores of New Guinea, and in token of that event I
am directed to hoist the British flag at Port Moresby and at
other places along the coast and islands. To-morrow, therefore, I
intend to hoist the English flag here, and to read a proclamation
which will be duly translated to you, and copies of which I hope
to be able to send you printed in your own language, and in the
mean time an English copy will be given to each chief for the
information of the people. I desire, on behalf of her Majesty the
Queen, to explain to you the meaning of the ceremonial which you
are about to witness. It is a proclamation that from this time
forth you are placed under the protection of her Majesty's
Government; that evil-disposed men will not be able to occupy
your country, to seize your lands, or to take you away from your
own homes. I have been instructed to say to you that what you
have seen done here to-day on board her Majesty's ship of war,
and which will be done again to-morrow on shore, is to give you
the strongest assurance of her Majesty's gracious protection of
you, and to warn bad and evil-disposed men that if they attempt
to do you harm they will be promptly punished by the officers of
the Queen. Your lands will be secured to you; your wives and
children will be protected. Should any injury be done to you, you
will immediately inform her Majesty's officers, who will reside
amongst you, and they will hear your complaints, and do you
justice. You will look upon all white persons whom the Queen
permits to reside amongst you as your friends and her Majesty's
subjects. The Queen will permit nobody to reside here who does
you injury. You will under no circumstances inflict punishment
upon any white person; but if such person has done you wrong you
will tell her Majesty's officers of that wrong, in order that the
case may be fairly inquired into. You must know that it is for
your security, and to prevent bloodshed, that the Queen sends me
here to you, and will send her officers to live amongst you. And
now I hope that you clearly understand that we are here amongst
you as your friends. You will all keep peace amongst yourselves,
and if you have disputes with each other, you will bring them
before the Queen's officers, who will settle them for you without
bloodshed. Should bad men come amongst you, bringing firearms and
gunpowder and intoxicating liquors, you are not to buy them, and
are to give notice at once to the Queen's officers, so that such
men may be punished. Always keep in your minds that the Queen
guards and watches over you, looks upon you as her children, and
will not allow any one to harm you, and will soon send her
trusted officers to carry out her gracious intentions in the
establishment of this Protectorate."</p>
<p>At the Commodore's request Mr. Lawes read a translation of
this address in the Motu language, the chiefs listening
attentively; and when Mr. Lawes had concluded, the Commodore,
again addressing the chiefs, said:</p>
<p>"I want to inform you that I have been sent here to proclaim
this Protectorate, and that the Queen will very shortly send a
high officer to take charge of the Protectorate, and that I am
ordered, when I depart from New Guinea, to place the Protectorate
in the charge of this officer, Mr. Romilly. This officer"
(pointing to Mr. Romilly) "will be the representative of the
Queen until the high officer the Queen appoints comes here to
undertake your protection."</p>
<p>Then calling the chief Boe Vagi forward, Commodore Erskine
shook hands with him, and introduced him to Mr. Romilly, and the
Commodore's intimation of the appointment of a High Commissioner
for New Guinea, and his explanation of Mr. Romilly's position,
were interpreted to the chiefs by Mr. Lawes. This was followed by
the appointment of Boe Vagi as head chief of the Motu tribe. It
appears that the chiefs of a tribe of natives on Guinea recognize
no one of their number as head or principal chief; and as the
continuance of such a custom would make it very difficult for the
High Commissioner or his deputy to deal effectually with matters
connected with the natives which from time to time may require
attention, Commodore Erskine saw the necessity for selecting from
a tribe the chief possessing the highest claim to be regarded as
the most important chief in his district and investing him with
such authority as would make him the means of communication with
the Commissioner respecting any matter which any branch or member
of the tribe might desire to bring to the Commissioner's
knowledge. Accordingly Boe Vagi was selected for the position of
head chief of the Motu tribe. To make his appointment more
distinct, he was presented with an emblem of authority in the
form of an ebony stick with a florin let in at the top, the
Queen's head being uppermost, and encircled by a band of silver.
Handing to Boe Vagi this stick, the Commodore said:</p>
<p>"I present him with this stick, which is to be an emblem to
him of his authority; and all the tribes who are represented by
the chiefs here are to look to the holder of this stick, Boe
Vagi. This stick represents the Queen's head, the Queen of
England; and if at any time any of the people of these tribes
have any grievance or anything to say, they are, through this
man, the holder of this stick, Boe Vagi, to make it known to the
Queen's officer, in order that it may be inquired into. This
stick is to be the symbol of his authority, and all the tribes
are to have communication through him with the Queen's
officer."</p>
<p>This was interpreted by Mr. Lawes, and photographs of the
scene were taken, one of the groups representing the Commodore
shaking hand with Boe Vagi, who stood with his emblem of
authority in his left hand.</p>
<p>Directed then to descend to the main deck, the chiefs walked
one after the other into the Commodore's cabin, where each
received a present consisting of a tomahawk, a butcher's knife, a
coloured shirt, or a piece of coloured cloth, and some figs of
twist tobacco. It was a curious sight to see these chiefs, some
of them very old men, but others young, erect, and muscular,
filing in at one door, and, after shaking hands with the
Commodore and receiving a present, leaving by the other; and it
was very amusing to notice how startled some of them were at
suddenly discovering themselves in a large pier-glass, which they
had to pass before leaving the cabin. The Commodore did not fail
to point out, through Mr. Lawes, to the chief who had burnt the
village of another, that for the future he would not be allowed
to commit such an act, and must through the Queen's officers seek
redress for any grievance he might have; and the man was
evidently impressed by what was said to him.</p>
<p>After the chiefs had received their presents, the firing off
of some of the guns of the ship took place, so that the natives
might be interested by seeing what could be done in the way of
firing at long distances. A Nordenfeldt was directed at a target
in the water, and a Gatling was placed in the foretop, and
several rounds of ball cartridges were fired, to the evident
astonishment of the chiefs; but what filled them with the
greatest wonder was the firing and bursting of a shell, and
afterwards the firing of a shot from one of the 18-ton guns at a
range of nearly four thousand yards. This ended the day's
proceedings, and the chiefs left with the missionaries for the
shore; but at night the <i>Nelson</i> was brilliantly illuminated
with blue lights at the yardarms and at the ports facing the
village, and the electric light was exhibited. Rockets shot up
into the air from the <i>Nelson</i> and the <i>Espiegle</i>, and
the <i>Nelson's</i> steam fog-horn, known on board as the
"Siren," and possessing the power of making a most unearthly
noise, was sounded.</p>
<p>At half-past six next morning the landing of officers and men
from the squadron for the purpose of publicly proclaiming the
establishment of the Protectorate and hoisting the British, flag
commenced. The general order issued by the Commodore directed
that the dress for officers should be cocked hat, undress coat,
and epaulettes; the dress for seamen white frocks and hats, and
that for marines white tunics and helmets. There was,
consequently, a very attractive display of uniforms, and
altogether it was an exceedingly interesting spectacle. The early
hour appointed for the landing permitted of the ceremony being
performed at a time of day when the heat, which was intense while
the <i>Nelson</i> was on the coast, was not likely to be very
trying to the men. The water of the harbour lay placid as a lake,
with the ships of war far out from the shore, and here and there
native canoes moving slowly along or resting idly on the surface;
and the hills and valleys were green and shaded from the sun, and
wore that refreshing appearance which is notable when the trees
and the grass have been bathed in dew, and when the sun's rays
are strong enough only to make the dewdrops sparkle, and to
deepen the shadows in the recesses where the sunlight has not yet
penetrated. The boats conveying the officers and men to the
shore, each flying the white ensign, imparted life and colour to
the scene upon the water, and nothing could be more picturesque
and beautiful than the view on shore, where the houses of the
native village bordering the beach, with their brown occupants
gazing in amazement on what was taking place before them, were
shaded by a grove of cocoanut palms, the refreshing dark-green
fronds being rivalled only by the lighter green of the
plantations of banana trees on the sides of the hills, which,
rising high above the village, were, notwithstanding the evidence
of cultivation by the natives and the existence of the little
mission settlement, dressed in almost all their native
loveliness, and robed in delicately tinted morning mists. Inside
the enclosed ground around the mission house, and on a spot
commanding a view of almost the entire harbour, was the
flagstaff, on which the flag had been hoisted by Mr. Chester and
by Mr. Romilly, and which was now to display the flag hoisted
with the authority of the Queen by Commodore Erskine; and it was
around this flagstaff that the troops were drawn up in a hollow
square, the men facing inwards, with the officers to the front,
and the Commodore and his suite standing with the missionaries
and Mr. Chester on the verandah of the mission house. The native
chiefs who had been on board the <i>Nelson</i> were seated in a
picturesque group on the ground, immediately in front of the
Commodore; and other natives and a few white spectators stood in
a crowd at the rear of the blue-jackets. The only representative
of English women present was Mrs. Lawes, wife of the Rev. W. G.
Lawes, who was accommodated with a chair, and sat near the
Commodore and the officers on either side of him.</p>
<p>The landing party from the ships consisted of two companies of
blue-jackets, numbering ninety men, and one company of marines,
to the number of forty-six men, belonging to the <i>Nelson</i>,
fifty blue-jackets and marines from the <i>Espiegle</i>,
twenty-five from the <i>Raven</i>, and ten from the
<i>Harrier</i>. Besides these there was a band and colour party
from the <i>Nelson</i>. Captain Bridge, of the <i>Espiegle</i>,
had general charge of the arrangements; Commander W. H. Henderson
commanded the <i>Nelson's</i> men, who formed the firing-party;
and Lieutenant Ommanney, of the <i>Espiegle</i>, with Lieutenant
Thompson, of the same ship. Lieutenant Lucas, of the
<i>Raven</i>, and Mr. Broadhurst, boatswain of the
<i>Harrier</i>, was in command of the unarmed party. Lieutenant
Tillard, of the <i>Nelson</i>, was the officer in charge of the
battalion, and under Commander W. H. Henderson there were the
following officers from the <i>Nelson</i>:&mdash;Lieutenant
Fenton and Major Dowding, R.M.L.I., as battalion leaders;
Lieutenant Hon. G. Digby, Lieutenant Portman, and Lieutenant
Drake, R.M.A., commanding companies; Midshipmen Henniker and
Sullivan as guards of No. 1 Company, and Midshipmen Cleeve and
Blackett as guards of No. 2 Company. The colours were carried by
Midshipmen Walter and Hunter. The Commodore was attended by his
secretary, Mr. H. L. Warren, Deputy-Commissioner Romilly,
Staff-Commander Osborne, Fleet-Surgeon Knott, Paymaster Bowen,
Chief-Engineer Giles, and Rev. W. G. Lawes; and among the
officers who received him when he landed were
Lieutenant-Commander Ross, of H.M.S. <i>Raven</i>, and
Lieutenant-Commander Wilcox, of H.M.S. <i>Harrier</i>,
Sub-Lieutenant Gaunt and Midshipman Hon. D. Lambton, of the
<i>Nelson</i>, acted as the Commodore's A.D.C.'s; Midshipman
Tollemache was A.D.C. to Captain Bridge; and Midshipman Shepherd
A.D.C. to Commander Henderson. The other officers present
were&mdash;from the <i>Nelson</i>, Surgeon Pickthorn, Lieutenant
Thynne, Assistant-Paymasters Cubitt and Greenwood, Engineers
Warrington and Medus, and Clerk Banon; and from the
<i>Espiegle</i>, Staff-Surgeon Irvine, Paymaster Matthew,
Assistant-Paymaster Forand. Remaining on board the <i>Nelson</i>,
to salute the flag immediately it was hoisted on shore, and to
dress the ship with bunting, were First Lieutenant E. E. Maxwell,
Surgeon Dow, and Sub-Lieutenant H. G. Smith.</p>
<p>Immediately the blue-jackets had landed they were marched up
the hill to the mission compound, but the marines remained upon
the beach until the Commodore landed, when they presented arms,
and afterwards, with bayonets fixed, marched with the band to
join the blue-jackets in front of the mission house. This
structure is a long weatherboard building of one story, with a
wide verandah, the principal portion of which faces the harbour;
but the eastern end is towards the hills and the palm trees, and
it was at this end where the Commodore stood and proclaimed the
establishment of the Protectorate. On the Commodore appearing
before the troops they presented arms, and he then read the
following proclamation:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center">"PROCLAMATION.</p>
<p class="negindent">"Proclamation on behalf of her Most Gracious
Majesty Victoria, by the grace of God, of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland Queen, Defender of the Faith, Empress
of India, establishing a Protectorate of her Most Gracious
Majesty over a portion of New Guinea and the islands adjacent
thereto.</p>
<p>"To all to whom these presents shall come, greeting:</p>
<p>"Whereas it has become essential, for the protection of the
lives and properties of the native inhabitants of New Guinea, and
for the purpose of preventing the occupation of portions of that
country by persons whose proceedings, unsanctioned by any lawful
authority, might tend to injustice, strife, and bloodshed, and
who, under the pretence of legitimate trade and intercourse,
might endanger the liberties and possess themselves of the lands
of such native inhabitants, that a British Protectorate should be
established over a certain portion of such country and the
islands adjacent thereto.</p>
<p>"And whereas her Majesty, having taken into her gracious
consideration the urgent necessity of her protection to such
inhabitants, has directed me to proclaim such protection in a
formal manner at this place: Now, I, James Elphinstone Erskine,
captain in the Royal Navy, and commodore of the Australian
station, one of her Majesty's naval aides-de-camp, do hereby, in
the name of her Most Gracious Majesty, declare and proclaim the
establishment of such Protectorate over such portions of the
coast and the adjacent islands as is more particularly described
in the schedule hereunto annexed.</p>
<p>"And I hereby proclaim and declare that no acquisition of
land, whensoever or howsoever acquired, within the limits of the
Protectorate hereby established, will be recognized by her
Majesty; And I do hereby, on behalf of her Majesty, command and
enjoin all persons whom it may concern to take notice of this
proclamation.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">"<span class="aa">SCHEDULE</span>.</p>
<p>"All that portion of the southern shores of New Guinea
commencing from the boundary of that portion of the country
claimed by the Government of the Netherlands on the 141st
meridian of east longitude to East Cape, with all islands
adjacent thereto south of East Cape to Kosman Island inclusive,
together with the islands in the Goschen Straits.</p>
<p>"Given on board her Majesty's ship <i>Nelson</i>, at the
harbour of Port Moresby, on the 6th day of November, 1884.</p>
<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">"(Signed)
<span class="aa">James Elphinstone Erskine</span>,</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:10%;">
"Commodore.</div>
<p align="center">"God Save the Queen."</p>
<br>
<p>This was interpreted to the natives by the Rev. W. G. Lawes,
who, at the request of Commodore Erskine, had translated it into
the Motu language; and then, by direction of the Commodore, the
Union Jack was slowly raised to the truck of the flagstaff by
Sub-Lieutenant Gaunt, who filled the position of Flag-Lieutenant
of H.M.S. <i>Nelson</i>, The troops immediately presented arms,
and as the flag was ascending the band played a bar of the
National Anthem, a salute of twenty-one guns was fired from the
<i>Nelson</i>, and the ships of war were almost instantaneously
dressed with flags from stem to stern, the royal standard flying
conspicuously from the <i>Nelson's</i> main. When the
<i>Nelson</i> had saluted the flag and the firing had ceased, the
troops fired a <i>feu-de-joie</i> of three rounds, the band
playing a bar of the National Anthem after each of the first two
rounds, and two bars after the third.</p>
<p>All this not a little astonished the natives, though some of
those whose homes were at Port Moresby had witnessed the firing
of a <i>feu-de-joie</i> before; but though the firing startled
some of them, it had, with the general display, the effect of
impressing them all with some sense of the solemn importance of
the ceremony that was being performed. The firing-party were then
ordered to shoulder arms, and the Commodore, addressing all
present at the ceremony but the natives, said:</p>
<p>"Officers and Men, Mr. Romilly and Gentlemen, This interesting
and important ceremony being now formally concluded, it only
remains for me, in her Majesty's name, to express the fervent
hope that under the blessing of Almighty God the establishment of
this Protectorate may conduce to the peace, happiness, and
welfare of the people of this vast territory. May the British
flag, which we have this day planted on these shores, be to the
people of this portion of New Guinea the symbol of their freedom
and their liberty, and the proclamation which I have just read
the charter of their rights and privileges. May it be to them a
Protectorate in deed as well as in name, protecting them alike
from the encroachments of foreigners and the aggressive or
unlawful actions of persons of any other nationality; may the
blessings of civilization and Christianity, the seeds of which
have been already sown by English hands in the persons of the
brave and good men present on this occasion, increase and
multiply exceedingly amongst them! And lastly, as the Union Jack,
which has on several former occasions been hoisted on the shores
of New Guinea and the adjacent islands, is on this day for the
first time displayed and hoisted on New Guinea under the
authority and by the command of her Most Gracious Majesty Queen
Victoria, I most fervently pray that the establishment of a
British Protectorate on these shores may tend to ensure the
integrity and inviolability of the great Australian colonies, and
promote the best interests of their people; and I trust that this
important step may be attended with the happiest results, and
redound to the honour of her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, for
whom I now invite you to give three hearty cheers."</p>
<p>The call was right loyally responded to, and, with Captain
Bridge leading, three British cheers rang out and echoed among
the hills; and then, with a royal salute, the troops once more
presenting arms, the ceremony was brought to a close.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><span class="uu">The Native Village and the
Natives at Port Moresby&mdash;Curiously formed
Houses&mdash;Native Manners and Customs&mdash;Interesting
Sights&mdash;The Village School&mdash;A Trading Voyage&mdash;A
Village in the Trees.</span></p>
<p><span class="aa">The</span> native village and the mission
station at Port Moresby have been built close to the water's
edge, the houses of the natives mostly in the water itself, and
the mission house on the high land of one of the hills which
rise, with little flat land about them, from the beach. The
native village is a very curious place. It consists of three
collections of houses, which are made of the leaf of the
pandanus, used as a kind of thatch, fastened to a light framework
of wood, and resting upon wooden props, or slender piles, driven
into the sand, so that the tide washes around them. They look
like a lot of haystacks raised to escape the effects of a flood.
At each end of a house there is a doorway, but there is no window
in any part of the structure, and the interior is generally dark
and sombre-looking. Access to a house is obtained by means of a
roughly constructed ladder, which ascends from the beach to a
platform made of poles and of planks cut from the sides of old
canoes, and the platform is available for the double purpose of
affording sitting accommodation for a family of natives in the
afternoon, when the whole population of the village is outside
enjoying the fresh air, and of enabling the natives to pass from
a house fronting the beach to one or more houses in its immediate
rear. The natives literally swarm about the houses, the men
destitute of any sign of clothing, and the women and girls
wearing a petticoat made of pandanus fibre, which descends from
the waist almost to the knees. The women do most of the work
connected with the tribe. The men make the fences around the
plantations and dig up the ground, and they fish; but the women
do everything else. In front of most of the houses many of the
women, particularly the very old ones, are constantly engaged in
preparing clay for the manufacture of earthenware pots, which are
made absolutely by the hand, and then baked in ordinary wood
fires on the ground. These pots are the chief articles of trade
with the Port Moresby natives, and they are taken along the coast
and exchanged for sago and other articles of food.</p>
<p>The men, when at home, unless there is something very special
for them to do, sit or saunter about without occupation, and give
an observer the impression that they are very indolent and not
over-clean. They are a small race of light copper-coloured
people, with coarse black and brown hair standing out from the
head like an immense mop, and with ornaments consisting of bands
of dogs' teeth and shells twisted around the head to keep the
hair from encroaching too much upon the forehead; shell necklaces
and large pieces of pearl, crescent-shaped, which are greatly
prized by the women, around their necks; and long, narrow, and
rounded pieces of shell, like a cone and slightly curved, through
the septum of the nose. Sticking out from their hair is an
instrument used as a comb, but made of three sticks bound at one
end, so that at the other they shall appear like three prongs
several inches in length; and some of these combs are ornamented
with feathers, and then the natives appear as though they were
decorated with a plume.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image03" id="Image03"></a><img alt=""
src="1400631h-images/Image03.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>NATIVE HOUSE AND CANOES.</small></p>
<br>
<p>From the experiences gained amongst these natives while the
<i>Nelson</i> was at Port Moresby, their principal desire seemed
to be tobacco, or koko as they call it, which they smoke in large
bamboo pipes by a very singular method. Only the commonest twist
tobacco, known as trade tobacco, suits their tastes, and when
about to smoke a bit of this is broken into shreds by one of
them, who is frequently a girl. It is then wrapped in a leaf into
the form of a rude cigarette, which is placed in a small hole
near the closed end of the bamboo pipe and lighted. The girl
applies her mouth to the open end of the bamboo, which she fills
with smoke, and then withdrawing the cigarette the pipe is handed
round, each native inhaling from the hole where the cigarette has
been as much of the smoke as his mouth will hold, and emitting it
from mouth and nostrils until the quantity in the pipe has been
exhausted.</p>
<p>Some very interesting, as well as repulsive, sights are met
with by a visitor to the village. When strolling through in the
afternoon, it is interesting to watch the method in preparing
food, or in making earthenware pots or fishing-nets, or in
watching the children skip about and play, which they do with as
much innocence and glee as English children; but it is repulsive
to notice that many of the natives, especially the children,
suffer from loathsome sores, and that some of the habits of the
village are very objectionable to European ideas of propriety.
The village swarms with pigs and dogs, mostly young ones, and it
is not an uncommon thing to see a native woman suckling her child
at one breast and a dog at the other, the dog receiving quite as
much attention as the child. It is equally common to see a
'native of one sex intently examining the head of one of the
other sex, and eating with evident satisfaction what is found.
There is also the unclean practice, which is followed by the
natives of some other islands, of chewing the betel nut, and at
the same time filling the mouth with lime, taken by means of a
stick from a gourd, in which the lime is kept. This has the
effect of greatly discolouring the teeth, and imparting to the
mouth a very unsightly reddish appearance. On the other hand,
cakes and fish are baked in a cleanly way, being wrapped in
banana leaves and laid on the embers; and though a whole family
may sit around a dish containing a meal of mashed yams, or sago
and cocoanut, they eat in a decent manner with spoons made from
the shell of the cocoanut.</p>
<p>Most of the children attend the mission school, and an
exceedingly interesting scene was witnessed in the school by the
Commodore during his stay at Port Moresby, after returning from
the west. It was arranged that he would visit the school one
afternoon, and the ringing of the bell, which hangs from the
branch of a tree in full hearing of the village, brought together
about 120 children, the boys in the nude condition usual with
them, and the girls dressed in their fibre petticoats. The
children were seated on the floor of the schoolroom&mdash;a long
cool building, with walls and a roof made of the pandanus leaf,
and the floor of boards from old canoes&mdash;the boys on one
side and the girls on the other; and behind the children were the
native teachers and their wives. The children manifested all the
interest and obedience expected from European children, and they
were examined by Mr. Chalmers. They sang, answered questions in
geography, counted in English from one to a hundred, and gave the
English for several phrases in common use spoken to them by Mr.
Chalmers in their own language. Their knowledge of the names of
countries and their capital cities, of oceans, seas, and islands,
as they were indicated on the different maps, was remarkable; and
they were perfectly familiar with the appearance and position of
their own country, which they know only by the name of New
Guinea. They sang in their own tongue some hymns, and also "Auld
Lang Syne" and the "National Anthem;" and reverently standing,
with eyes closed, they repeated the Lord's Prayer. There was
something very touching about this to most of the English
listeners; for, although the words of the dark-skinned children
were unintelligible, their attitude and their earnestness showed
that they had been taught to understand the meaning of the
beautiful words they were repeating. The whole scene was such as
to give rise to feelings of sympathy, and to make one long to be
able to distribute a tin of lollies or a basket of buns amongst
the little ones. It seemed very much opposed to the English idea
of the fitness of things that fishhooks and sticks of trade
tobacco should be considered suitable gifts for them, and yet the
eyes of the little people, as they each received the Commodore's
present of a fishhook, a stick of tobacco, and a small paper of
beads, glistened with pleasure, just as the eyes of English
children do at school when they receive gifts or prizes; and when
they were dismissed-from school they bounded away with just the
same glee.</p>
<p>The native women have a custom of assembling in a body when
their husbands and their brothers go away from the village on a
long trading voyage, and expressing great sorrow at their
departure by loud cries of lamentation. When the trading canoes
left the port, just before the proclamation of the Protectorate,
the village was for a time full of weeping and wailing. While the
canoes were being loaded and provisioned for the journey, the
women were actively engaged in stowing away the earthenware pots,
and cutting and carrying firewood, and in putting on board the
canoes for food a large quantity of kangaroo or wallaby meat, the
men having had, a day or two before, a grand kangaroo hunt; and
it was not until the canoes were actually leaving the shore to
get under way that their manifestations of grief burst forth.
Then as the canoes, crowded with natives, were being pushed from
the shore, the natives who were to join those already on board
stood while their female relatives hung about their necks and
wept and said farewell; and then, disengaging themselves, the men
plunged into the water and swam to the canoes, the women seated
themselves on some canoes drawn up on the shore, or stood in
small crowds, indulging in tears and bitter cries. Many of the
women followed the canoes as they were taken by the men, with the
aid of bamboo poles, around to a part of the harbour where they
would secure the full force of the south-east monsoon, and only
bade farewell to their friends at the last moment; and another
lot, more affectionate or demonstrative than the last, sped
across the harbour to a point where the canoes could be
intercepted just before they went out to sea, and farewell was
said there. The spectacle was a most extraordinary one, and was
only equalled in the interest it excited by the scene which the
canoes presented as they took their departure.</p>
<p>The trading canoes are formed of two or three ordinary canoes
lashed together. In general appearance they seem to be little
more than a confused mass of wickerwork; but a closer examination
will show them to have been carefully and strongly constructed,
with a bamboo or cane deck, housed in at each end by means of a
kind of rough deckhouse made of split bamboo and pandanus leaves.
The principal mast is a sapling, which may be straight or
crooked, and it is kept in its place by a rope which is simply
one of the tough climbing plants indigenous to the country. On
this mast is spread a mat sail, shaped at the top like the claw
of a crab, one of the points being rigged to the mast, and the
other held in its place by a sprit. Unwieldy as they may appear,
the canoes, when they have a fair wind, sail very well and with
swiftness, and as they carry a large number of natives, three or
four of whom steer with their paddles, a fleet of them presents a
very interesting sight. There is very little life in the village
while these canoes are away, and, beyond the necessary labour of
preparing food, the women do not appear to do much work.</p>
<p>One house in the village attracts attention at any time the
place is visited, as it is the residence of the chief Boe Vagi,
and his daughter, who is the village belle. She is not very
beautiful according to English or Australian ideas of female
beauty, for her face is broad, her nose. flat, her mouth large,
and her head of hair immense. Moreover, she has been tattooed
down the forehead and the nose, and on the shoulders. But her
form is robust; she wears many bands of shells and a large piece
of pearl around her neck; she wags her petticoat with as much
style and effect as her sex in any more civilized place; and she
is evidently the admiration, if not the envy, of a select circle
of young female acquaintances who are generally with her in a
capacity something like that of maids-of-honour. Ever since the
ceremony performed in April, 1883, by Mr. H. M. Chester, when he
annexed the country to Queensland, Boe Vagi has had flying in
front of his house a small Union Jack; but by the direction of
the Commodore this flag was taken down, and a more appropriate
one put in its place. The new flag is a blue one, with a white
square in the corner filled in with a representation of a bird of
paradise, as in the case of an ensign with the Union Jack.</p>
<p>The tattooing of the natives is a singular custom, and is
carried out in a singular way. Until a girl has been properly and
fully tattooed she cannot get a husband, and her tattooing, like
the education of a European girl, is completed by the time she
reaches a marriageable age, when she is required to exhibit
herself before the tribe to show that she has the requisite
number of marks upon her body. Entering a house one day, I
discovered two natives being tattooed, one on the arm and the
other on the forehead. They were lying on the ground, and the
tattooing was being done by girls, who were sitting near the
recumbent natives, and puncturing the skin and inserting the
colouring matter at one and the same time, the only instrument
used being a kind of needle fixed to a small piece of stick,
which was held in the girl's left hand, while it was being gently
tapped with a small piece of stick held in the other hand.</p>
<p>Ten miles inland from Port Moresby the mountain tribes begin,
and some excursions arranged by the officers of the <i>Nelson</i>
to the Kaloki River led to the discovery of a most interesting
village of one of the tribes. It should be first stated, however,
that the country travelled through for the distance mentioned
consisted chiefly of rich alluvial land, much of it, doubtless,
in wet seasons being under water, but now luxuriant with palms,
tree ferns, and forest trees, and covered thickly with brilliant
green foliage and several kinds of blossoms and fruit The river
itself has its banks clothed with a dense growth of vegetation,
on which the wild fig tree and masses of gigantic vines and
creeping plants are conspicuous, giving it very much of the
appearance of the vegetation of some of the northern coast rivers
of New South Wales. It was just beyond this river, and in the
vicinity of a range of mountains, where the village just alluded
to was found. With the assistance of a native guide, the stream
was forded, and a track discovered through the brushwood, and
then the first sign of the presence of a native population came
into view in the form of an extensive banana plantation; and from
the plantation the houses of the natives were to be seen, not
upon the ground, or merely a few feet above it, as is the case
with the houses of the coast tribes, but high up on a pinnacle of
rocks, and higher still above the rocks in the branches of tall
trees. One could scarcely believe one's eyes, so extraordinary
did it seem, that any tribe of natives should construct their
dwellings, not as men usually do, but as birds build their nests.
Their houses were on the top of rocks fifty or sixty feet above
the ground, and those in the trees were fifty or sixty feet above
the rocks. On ascending the hill to reach the rocks, the reason
which leads the natives to live so high in the air was at once
apparent. The houses had been placed in their peculiar positions
in order that the tribe might be the better able to withstand
attacks from their enemies. The only paths by which the rocks can
be reached are so hemmed in by thick brushwood, and are so full
of obstacles in the form of stones and pieces of rock, that it
would be very difficult for more than one man to pass along at a
time; and right across the paths, about twenty feet below the
rocks upon which most of the houses are built, two rows of strong
wooden palisading have been placed; and if any enemies of the
tribe succeeded in passing the palisading, then the natives of
the village could at once abandon the houses on the rocks and
retreat to those in the trees. The houses themselves are very
similar to those on the coast, except that the pandanus thatch is
fastened in a somewhat different manner to the framework of wood,
and all of the houses in the trees have two stories. There is
very little ground to stand upon when the summit of the rocks is
reached, for the houses rest upon high pieces of rock, and the
trees in which the other houses have been placed grow from the
summit. These trees are large and lofty, with no branches below
the houses, and the houses are so constructed that the branches
on which they rest, or to which they are firmly lashed, pass
through the floor and the roof, or through the floor and one or
other of the walls. The houses are reached by means of roughly
constructed wooden ladders, which are difficult of ascent, and
may easily be removed by the natives after they retreat up the
trees. There were very few people about the village at the time
it was visited, and most of the houses were closed. Those natives
who were there were different in several respects from the Port
Moresby natives, as some of the men wore beards, and the women
were not tattooed. Now and then women may be found among these
mountain tribes with tattoo marks on their bodies, but these
marks are the result of vanity more than anything else, and they
occur in cases where a female visiting a coast tribe has had
herself decorated like those of her sex living there. Game is
abundant in the vicinity of the Kaloki river. Pigeons&mdash;the
principal of which is the gowra, or crested pigeon, a bird
weighing five or six pounds, having a handsome purple plumage and
very fine crest&mdash;are numerous; and ducks and geese, the
former including a white species with black wings, abound in the
marshes or swamps.</p>

<br>
<small>TRADING CANOES AT DELENA VILLAGE, HALL SOUND.</small></p>
<br>
<p>Hall Sound is a harbour eighty miles west of Port Moresby,
formed by the proximity of Yule Island to the mainland, and
though rather exposed to weather from the south-east, is safe and
affords good anchorage. Yule Island was the head-quarters of
D'Albertis, and it is not surprising that it attracted the
attention of the Italian explorer as a suitable base for his
operations in New Guinea, for it is a lovely gem upon the water,
and wears quite a fairy-like appearance. It is not very large,
and yet it has beautiful green hills, with crests of trees upon
their summits, from which one can look abroad upon a wide shining
expanse of sea, or, landwards, upon the immense delta of a river
which rises in far-off ranges of mountains whose secrets have not
yet been disclosed to white men, but whence have come strange
stories sufficient to create an intense longing to know more of
this interesting land. Or one may stroll through green glades,
wander among palms, revel in the shade and the delicious coolness
produced by broad-leaved trees, many of them bearing fruit, and
luxuriant creeping plants, some with gay blossoms, and all
clinging to the trees and the rocks or running along the ground
in rich festoons. And there are secluded bits of sandy beach
where the rocks and the vegetation cluster, and form delightful
nooks and crooks known only to a few natives who live in the
vicinity, and to the birds. All this may be found on Yule Island,
and it was with some astonishment we heard from Mr. Chalmers
that, lovely as the island is in appearance, it is not healthy,
but bears among the natives the reputation of being the haunt of
fever, or, as they say, of too many evil spirits; for it is to
evil spirits they ascribe all the sickness from which they
suffer. If it be a sickly place, the sickness probably arises
from the malaria blown over from the mainland, which immediately
opposite the island is very low and marshy.</p>
<p>As the <i>Nelson</i> approached the island, and when she
dropped anchor, which she did in the afternoon of Friday,
November 7, a number of natives were observed on the slope of one
of the hills, and half concealed by the vegetation, stealthily
watching the movements of the ship, some of the men being armed
with spears; but no sooner did a boat leave the ship for the
island than the natives disappeared from where they were first
observed, and on nearing the beach several of them could be seen
running away along the sand as hard as they could go. They were
evidently very frightened, and when the boat touched the shore
there was not a native in sight anywhere. The boat party, minus,
of course, the blue-jackets, who were left in charge of the boat,
walked in the direction the natives had taken when running away,
and a boy of the Port Moresby tribe, who had landed in the boat,
was sent on ahead to assure the natives that we were friends.
Then occurred an interesting experience of savage life. As we
left the sand of the beach and entered the wood or bush bordering
the beach, we could see some distance ahead the dark forms of the
natives crouching about the trunks of trees and watching us as we
advanced. A call of encouragement was made by the Port Moresby
boy, and by the captain of the mission schooner
<i>Ellengowan</i>, who also had landed in the boat, and then a
number of the natives came slowly and hesitatingly forward, with
green branches in their hands as a sign of peace. They were a
peculiar lot of people, for many of them had smeared their faces
with something like lamp-black or tar, and introduced between the
patches of black, lines of red or white. Like the natives of Port
Moresby, they were quite nude, wearing only a girdle of narrow
cloth; but the women wore the grass petticoat or skirt, though it
was not long enough to reach their knees. Physically the men were
fine-looking fellows, of a dark copper colour; but with their
paint, their nose ornaments, and their great heads of hair, bound
in some instances into the form of a large chignon, their general
aspect was not inviting. They appeared to be a little suspicious
with regard to the object of our visit but they were evidently
very pleased at finding we were friends, and they heaped
betel-nuts and sticks of betel-pepper upon us in return for a few
small pieces of tobacco we gave them, and led us at once to their
village. Catching hold of the hands of some of us, the natives,
with the chief at their head, took us to the houses and motioned
some of us to seat ourselves on the platforms, and a large mat
was spread upon the ground for the accommodation of the rest of
the party. Then, while some of the natives were noisily talking
and laughing, others brought cocoanuts, and, opening them, gave
us the refreshing milk to drink. Up to that time we had seen only
one female at the camp, but others soon came in from their
hiding-places, and stood around, gazing at us in wonder; and they
were followed by a lot of male natives, who, it was said, had
probably been lying in ambush as we were walking along the beach
to the camp, ready to throw their spears the moment they saw any
sign of our being enemies, and who now came dropping in one after
another rather sullenly, but only one or two carrying a spear.
The native houses, we found, were temporary structures,
consisting of bamboo platforms with sloping roofs of pandanus
leaf, erected to afford protection from the sun or from the night
dews, and to provide sleeping accommodation during the time the
natives were on the island, for they appeared to be making a
short stay there as a break in some long journey from one part of
the mainland to another, and in order that they might gather
cocoanuts, bananas, and yams from the plantations that existed on
the island. Bunches of green bananas, small heaps of cocoanuts,
and collections of yams were to be seen upon the platforms of
some of the dwellings; and in several places there was a fire
with a pot over it filled with yams and sago, cleanly protected
from dust or ashes by a covering of green banana leaves. The men
we saw were greatly interested with their white visitors, and it
was very entertaining to watch their merriment at what,
doubtless, they regarded as our stupidity when one of our number,
taking possession of a native's lime-gourd, fed the native and
one or two of his friends with the lime, while they chewed their
betel-nuts, and in the intervals between their bursts of laughter
cried "nahmo," which means "good." The women and girls were
tattooed to only a small extent, and therefore differed in that
respect from the women of Port Moresby; but their petticoats were
of exactly the same material.</p>
<p>We left these natives on the best of terms, and returned along
the beach to the boat, many of the men and boys accompanying us
until, when passing a point, they suddenly saw H.M.S.
<i>Raven</i> coming into the Sound; and their exclamations and
gestures of astonishment at the appearance of a second large
ship, or, in their imagination, probably wonderful canoe, were
worth witnessing. We tried to make them understand that it was
all right, but had to leave them in the midst of their
expressions of surprise. The <i>Raven</i> had brought a number of
chiefs to Hall Sound&mdash;natives who had been induced to come
by Mr. Chalmers, and who, after the <i>Raven</i> had anchored,
were brought on board the flagship and the next morning informed
of what was being done with regard to the British Protectorate,
and then given presents.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image05" id="Image05"></a><img alt=""
src="1400631h-images/Image05.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>A NEW GUINEA QUEEN.</small></p>
<br>
<p>There were eighteen chiefs in all, and some native teachers
and their wives, to listen to what the Commodore had to say. The
chiefs wore a girdle different from that at Port Moresby, and
only a few of them had ornaments around their necks. Some were
adorned with boars' tusks and shell armlets, and all wore their
hair in the form of a huge chignon, the band around it consisting
of a circlet of cassowary feathers. One chief, who enjoyed the
reputation of being a great warrior and a New Guinea Don Juan,
wore a dense head-dress of white and yellow cockatoo feathers,
and a band of some other birds' feathers around his hair. His
face was painted yellow and black&mdash;black marks on a dirty
yellow ground; and he wore armlets of green leaves, and then
around his wrists, legs, and ankles bands of green leaves, and
through the lobes of his ears&mdash;the holes in which, and in
the lobes of the ears of his fellows, were enormously
large&mdash;pieces of cane. Another of the chiefs wore a
head-dress of cassowary feathers, which surrounded and stood out
from his head as rays appear around the sun; at the back of his
head was stuck a long single feather, like the plume in the
bonnet of a Highlander; two pieces of the leaf of the pandanus
were hanging from his ears; and at his neck was a fine
pearl-shell crescent. The stick of office was given to Lavau, the
chief of the Lolo tribe at Delena, and he was informed that after
the Commodore left New Guinea a High Commissioner would come
there, until whose arrival Mr. Romilly would act. He was directed
by the Commodore to take care of the flag which was to be hoisted
on shore, and of the stick, both of which, it was explained to
him, were symbolical of the Queen's authority. The stick was to
be handed over to the Queen's officer whenever the chief was
called upon to do so; and when the Queen's officer came there,
the chief was to bring it to him and show that he had preserved
his trust in its integrity, and done his duty in the position he
was now appointed to fill. Some of the chiefs were from Nara, or
Cape Suckling; others from the Lolo tribe, around Hall Sound;
others, again, from Miva, the district adjoining Hall Sound; and
others from Kivori, or Cape Possession, the whole of them
representing from ten to twelve thousand people.</p>
<p>It had been hoped that the Queen of the Nara tribe, Queen
Koloka&mdash;a native dignitary who is really the only queen, as
far as the missionaries are aware, in New Guinea&mdash;would have
been present with the chiefs, but it was not until later on that
she made her appearance. There was nothing indicative of a
coronet about her head, nothing regal in her attire, nothing
stately or dignified in her form or movements. She was simply a
well-conditioned, dark copper-coloured woman, with black woolly
hair worn in the form of a chignon, a rather flat nose, and a
body plentifully tattoed; and she was attired in a grass
petticoat, a necklace of red beads, and a band of plaited fibre
around each arm. Her residence is at Cape Suckling, where she is
said to be waited upon by other female natives, as
maids-of-honour, and where she directs all feasts and the chiefs
pay her deference. Her father was a great chief, and when he was
dying he sent for his sons and directed them to place all power
in her hands; and they and other chiefs consenting, she became
queen of the tribe. Her presence on board the <i>Nelson</i> was
an important feature in the days proceedings, and the Commodore
gave her a special present.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of Saturday, November 8, the <i>Raven</i>
conveyed a party of officers and a detachment of blue-jackets and
marines from the <i>Nelson</i> to the shore on the mainland at a
point where a village called Delena is situated. Delena is the
principal village of the Lolo tribe, and has a mission station,
the mission being conducted by native teachers and their wives
from Raratonga. The houses of the natives are on the beach, built
as usual on props in a manner similar to the style of houses at
Port Moresby, but bunched more together. The male natives were
dressed rather differently from what we had previously seen, as
they wore a girdle of narrow cloth instead of one of string; the
women wore the ordinary petticoat. In general appearance both
males and females were, if anything, dirtier, and some of the
children more diseased, than those of the tribes previously met
with. The same affection on the part of the women for young dogs
was noticeable. In one part of the village, where a wrinkled old
woman was squatting with others of her kind upon the platform in
front of a house, there was hanging a small net, in which was
doubled up the sleeping form of an infant, the net being the New
Guinea cradle, which is swung gently from side to side when it is
necessary to soothe the infant to rest. Over the same platform,
and a few feet from where the infant was sleeping, was a second
net similar in all respects to the first, and in this second net
were sleeping&mdash;swung to rest as the child had been&mdash;a
litter of puppies.</p>
<p>The land about the village is very hilly, and is covered with
dense brushwood and tall forest trees, in which pigeons and birds
of paradise are said to be very plentiful. On one of the hills
immediately behind the native village, and in the midst of a
plantation of banana and mammy-apple trees, the mission house has
been built, and it is one of the coolest and cleanest structures
of the kind one could wish to see. The walls were made of thin
slabs of the sago palm, the roof of pandanus thatch on light
wooden rafters, and the floor, consisting of boards made from old
canoes, was covered with clean native matting. In this simple
dwelling lived a Raratongan teacher and his wife, the former
dressed in clean light-coloured shirt and trousers, and the
latter in a loose calico robe fitting close at the throat, and
most effectively setting off a not unattractive figure, and one
of the pleasantest of faces, with bright black eyes and a good
forehead, showing well beneath a plentiful supply of neatly
arranged glossy black hair. This pleasant face, and this clean,
cool dwelling, at a part of New Guinea where the sun was shining
with the fierceness of the heat of a great furnace, were
exceedingly refreshing to the visitors, and no one could resist
the temptation to enter the house and enjoy for a time its cool
shade and a drink of cold water.</p>
<p>A working party of blue-jackets had landed from the
<i>Nelson</i>, under the command of First Lieutenant Maxwell,
early on the morning of November 8, to prepare and erect a
flagstaff; and in good time, with the assistance of almost every
native in the village, a large forest tree of suitable form and
height was felled and prepared, and drawn up the hill to the site
selected as the best for the ceremony of hoisting the flag. A
hole was dug for the flagstaff immediately in front of the
mission house, and almost in the centre of the banana plantation,
on a spot where a grand outlook was attainable in the direction
of the ocean, and where the Union Jack would be easily seen by
any vessel entering the Hall Sound.</p>
<p>There was a great crowd of natives present to witness the
ceremony of hoisting the flag, and some of them exhibited
surprisingly large head-dresses. Two of them conspicuously
adorned in this manner were men of stalwart and lofty build. One
had painted his whole form black, and dressed his head and neck
with feathers of the same colour, for he was in mourning for some
deceased relative or friend. As the hair of this native was worn
in the huge mop-like fashion, the feathers sticking out from it
increased the size of what was to be seen above the man's head to
a very great extent, and by wearing a flat circular shell on his
forehead, and encircling his neck with a band of cassowary
feathers, he had imparted to himself a most extraordinary
appearance. The other man had lavishly adorned his head with
cassowary feathers, and wore around his hair a band of white
shells, like cowrie shells. His chest was ornamented with boars'
tusks, which hung from his neck, and similar ornaments were
hanging at his back. His face was painted in a manner which gave
him a somewhat hideous aspect, and he was liberally tattooed,
many of the marks being indicative, it was said, of the number of
enemies he had killed. These and other men with conspicuous
head-dresses were placed in the front of the general body of
natives assembled, all of whom were directed to seat themselves
upon the ground; but the position of honour was given to Queen
Koloka, who sat with her husband, a most ordinary-looking Prince
Consort, and, at least as far as appearances went, a very
unimportant native. Then the ceremony began, and very soon the
guns from the ships of war were thundering their salute to the
newly hoisted flag, and the high hills were throwing back their
echoes, while the picturesque group surrounding the flagstaff
were listening in solemn silence, and the native portion of it
with something akin to awe. Without a doubt they were deeply
impressed by what they were witnessing. They sat with widely
opened eyes, exchanging glances of amazement; and at the
extraordinary sounds that appeared to be in the very midst of
their own previously peaceful hills, there were not only signs of
astonishment, but evidences of fear, which so increased when the
small-arms party around the flagstaff fired the
<i>feu-de-joie</i>, that at the first rattle of the rifles the
natives, from the Queen and the chiefs downwards, crouched to the
ground and tried to hide themselves, one behind the other, for
safety.</p>
<p>The ceremony over, the Commodore desired to have the Queen
photographed, but it was some time before her Majesty could be
prevailed upon to consent to anything of the kind. She ran away
and hid herself in a shed adjoining the mission house, and even
when she was discovered by some of the mission teachers' wives,
it took a great deal of persuasion to induce her to come from her
hiding-place, and still more to get her in front of the
photographer's apparatus. She was evidently possessed by the fear
of something unpleasant happening to her if she were to consent
to what was proposed; but she came out from the shed eventually,
bringing with her a stuffed bird of paradise, which she handed to
the Commodore as though she wished to conciliate him, and then
she reluctantly submitted herself to those who wished to put her
in the proper attitude for the photographer. She was taken to the
steps which led up to the doorway of the mission house, and
seated upon one of them, her grass petticoat being arranged as
gracefully as its peculiar style and material would permit, and
her hands folded upon her lap, and in that position her
photograph was taken, though more than once, while the
photographer, with his head concealed under the dark cloth, was
adjusting his apparatus so as to judge his distance aright, she
seemed again inclined to fly.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><span class="uu">Influence of the Rev. J.
Chalmers among the Natives&mdash;Landing through the Surf to
collect Chiefs&mdash;Reception by the Natives&mdash;A Frightened
Chief.</span></p>
<p><span class="aa">Early</span> the following morning (Sunday),
the <i>Nelson</i> and the <i>Raven</i> left Hall Sound for Motu
Motu, a locality fifty miles further west The <i>Raven</i>
carried Mr. Chalmers and Mr. H. M. Chester, and left in advance
of the <i>Nelson</i> for the purpose of calling at some places
between Hall Sound and Motu Motu to pick up chiefs.</p>
<p>For some distance westwards the coast is moderately high, but
with a strip of flat land bordering the beach and planted with
cocoanut trees, which supply food to the coast population. For
forty miles along this part of New Guinea the cocoanut
plantations can be seen with scarcely a break between them, and
native villages are very numerous. The <i>Raven</i> kept much
closer in shore than the <i>Nelson</i>, in order that Mr.
Chalmers might be the better able to land; and it was not
difficult to see from the former vessel how fruitful the land
generally is, and how populous this part of the coast must be. I
was on board the <i>Raven</i>, with the object of witnessing the
manner in which Mr. Chalmers goes among the natives, and judging
for myself the influence he is known to possess amongst them; and
so I landed with him and Captain Ross, the commander of the
<i>Raven</i>, at the first village from which chiefs were wanted.
The <i>Raven</i> stood in as close to the shore as she could with
safety, and then the ship's whaleboat was lowered. The landing
was through the surf, for there was no harbour or shelter of any
kind in the neighbourhood, and the presence of a heavy swell
where the ship was lying-to was an indication that the sea would
probably be breaking heavily on the beach. As we neared the shore
we could see natives watching us, and gradually closing together
in a crowd, while others could be observed running from the
outskirts of the village to the part of the beach where we were
expected to land. Mr. Chalmers asked Captain Ross to permit a
native interpreter who was in the boat to get into the bow, so
that he might speak to the natives on shore immediately we got
within hearing of them; and with this precaution against going in
a suspicious manner, unarmed and almost helpless, into the midst
of a crowd of savages, who might, if they chose, take the lives
of every one of us easily, the boat entered the surf, struggled
through it, and then grounded within a few yards of the shore,
the interpreter at the same time shouting to the natives an
explanation of our strange appearance, and they in reply giving
vent to a Babel of exclamations, and rushing into the water to
the boat with the intention of dragging it upon the sand high and
dry. This they were not permitted to do, and in a hurried account
of our visit, and what was being done along the coast, they were
made to understand that the boat must without delay return to the
ship, which was waiting for it, but that we would go ashore for a
few minutes, as we wanted the chief of the place to accompany us
back to the Commodore, in order that they might see what was
being done by him, and receive some presents.</p>
<p>Immediately a dozen or more natives were eager to carry us
through the water from the boat to the shore; and, deeming it
better to get astride their oily backs than get wet by wading, we
clung to three of them, and were carried to the beach in front of
the village. There, in a pleasant way, we greeted everybody, and
Mr. Chalmers broke a few sticks of trade tobacco into small
pieces and distributed them. This proceeding propitiated all in
the crowd about us, and Mr. Chalmers, through the interpreter,
then again urged that the chiefs should return with him to the
ship. There were two chiefs present, and ultimately they
consented to go, which was very satisfactory; but it was
surprising that Mr. Chalmers should have succeeded so quickly and
so easily. Though, before making a move to return to the ship, we
stayed long enough to drink some cocoanut milk, to purchase a few
curios, and to take some notice of the peculiarities of dress and
habitation adopted in the locality, we could not have been on the
shore more than about ten minutes, and it seemed marvellous that
in so short a space of time Mr. Chalmers should have been able to
persuade a community of natives&mdash;who had probably never
before seen a vessel larger than a small schooner, and who must
have found it difficult to imagine a vessel the size of the
<i>Nelson</i>, and who certainly could not be expected to
comprehend what was being done by the Commodore&mdash;that it was
safe for their chiefs to go with him. Yet he did so persuade
them, and the two chiefs got into the boat, and we pushed off
from the shore at once. One of the chiefs appeared to repent of
his rashness when the boat was about twenty yards on its way to
the ship, and he shouted to the crowd on the beach so loudly and
so earnestly, that we could not but see he was calling to them to
come and bring him back; but Mr. Chalmers, knowing that in the
end the chief would be well pleased with his visit to the
<i>Nelson</i>, urged Captain Ross to get to the <i>Raven</i> as
quickly as possible, and directed the interpreter to speak to the
chief and dismiss his fears. This was evidently the right course
to adopt, for after this chief had reached the <i>Raven</i>, and
had been joined by other chiefs further along the coast&mdash;one
of them being induced by Mr. Chalmers, before he reached the
shore, to leave a canoe and get into the <i>Raven's</i>
boat&mdash;he was as quiet and contented as possible.</p>

<p><span class="aa">The</span> villages visited by H.M.S.
<i>Raven</i> along the coast between Hall Sound and Motu Motu
were Oiapu, Iokea, and Lesi, and the natives in them belonged to
the Elema tribe, who extend from Cape Possession to Maclatchie
Point, and number in all about twenty thousand persons. The most
central and the principal locality peopled by this tribe is Motu
Motu, and it proved in some respects to be the most interesting
place we called at during the whole of the time the Commodore was
on the coast. When I landed with Mr. Chalmers and Captain Ross at
Oiapu, I noticed that we had come amongst a people who differed
in habitation, dress, and general appearance from the natives we
had met further eastward, but at Motu Motu we saw the Elema
natives in, as it were, their capital, with all their
peculiarities of dress and ornament and their strange manner of
life apparent on every hand, and unaffected in the slightest
degree by any intercourse with or even knowledge of white
men.</p>
<p>The <i>Nelson</i> anchored off Motu Motu rather late in the
afternoon of Sunday, November 9, and was joined by the
<i>Raven</i> shortly before dusk. The anchorage was several miles
from the shore, entirely unprotected, and off a beach which, with
the exception of a small opening into a lagoon, stretched in an
unbroken line on either hand for many miles. Cocoanut trees were
very abundant, and were within view east and west as far as the
eye could reach, and in the midst of them, right opposite the
ships at anchor, was the village of Motu Motu. Soon after the
<i>Nelson</i> had dropped her anchor, a boat left for the shore,
and though the hour was so late that the stay on shore was
exceedingly short, some incidents of this preliminary visit were
a very fitting introduction to the events which were to transpire
on the morrow. The landing was through the surf, but at the time
the boat went to the shore the surf was not heavy, and there was
no difficulty in getting to the beach, where a small crowd of
natives greeted the boat party with exclamations of astonishment
and welcome. Two of the party in the boat were seized by a native
and led towards his house, and there a mat was brought from the
house and spread upon the ground in order that the visitors might
seat themselves upon it. But this courtesy was as nothing
compared with something else that occurred, for as the native was
leading the two gentlemen to his house he noticed that another
native held in his hand a stone club, and with an exclamation and
gesture which seemed to say, "We want no clubs here," the first
native snatched the weapon from the other and threw it inside a
fence.</p>
<p>Nothing could have been more indicative of friendship; no
proceeding could have shown more plainly the determination of at
least some portion of the Motu Motu people not to be compromised
by any display of arms, or anything else which might be regarded
as a protest against the unaccountable invasion of the territory
by the white strangers, and a wish to oppose their landing. And
yet there were important reasons why some show of resistance
would have appeared very natural. These natives were said to have
seen only two white men previous to the landing of the party from
the <i>Nelson</i> that Sunday evening, and though native teachers
connected with the New Guinea mission had been introduced among
them, the mission work had scarcely begun, for the teachers
landed at the place only last June. Yet here were two enormous
vessels&mdash;so large that the native mind when contemplating
them must have been filled with amazement&mdash;anchored off the
village, for what purpose the natives could not possibly
conceive, and filled with white men who might or might not be
friendly, and who had commenced to land immediately after their
arrival. No wonder the stone club made its appearance; it would
not have been surprising if a line of sable warriors, armed with
clubs and spears and bows and arrows, had spread themselves along
the beach, with their arrows at the string and their spears
poised and quivering in readiness for a flight through the air at
the white invaders. But nothing of that kind occurred.
Astonishment and a desire to be friendly were the points most
noticeable in the behaviour of the natives, and the boat party,
before returning to the <i>Nelson</i>, were able to view some
portion of the village and its inhabitants, to note that they
were in many respects remarkably different from any village and
people previously seen, and to observe that close to the village
there was a large lagoon leading to the mouth of a river, and
appearing, in its evening tints and shadows, and its picturesque
surroundings of native houses and cocoanut and sago palms and
forest vegetation, as pretty a bit of scenery as one might wish
to see.</p>
<p>Later on, and after dinner, the chiefs of Motu Motu and those
picked up by the <i>Raven</i> were assembled on board the
flagship for the usual palaver and giving of presents, and
together these chiefs were a fine-looking lot of men; but there
was one fellow among them who was remarkable for his cruel and
repulsive cast of features. Several of the chiefs were dressed
and ornamented in a style that gave them a somewhat hideous
appearance, and showed that they were warriors; but this fellow,
besides being attired in his fighting paint and ornaments, had
lost one eye, and had absolutely no chin&mdash;two peculiarities
of countenance which, with-a receding forehead, short woolly
hair, and large protruding mouth, imparted to him an aspect
calculated to inspire any one in his vicinity with aversion and
dread When this chief was allowed to see himself in the
pier-glass in the Commodore's cabin, even he was struck with his
repulsively ugly appearance. In all probability he had never
before seen himself reproduced with more fidelity than had been
the result of his stooping to drink from some mountain pool; and
so, when he saw himself in the pier-glass with all the
distinctness of reality, his first sensation was blank
astonishment, then doubt and incredulity, and then, as the
thought seemed to occur to him that what he saw must be a
faithful representation of what he was, a parting of his ugly
lips, a display of his black and red teeth, and a burst of
harsh-sounding laughter. The chief to whom the stick of office
was given was Semessi, a resident at Motu Motu, and to him and
the others was explained by the Commodore, through Mr. Chalmers
and a native who spoke the Motu Motu language, what the visit of
the warships meant.</p>
<p>Early the following morning the ceremony on shore took place,
and then there was a most interesting scene. A flagstaff was
erected on a sandspit, some little distance from the village, and
between the ocean and the lagoon, and shortly before eight
o'clock, the boats of the men-of-war were conveying the officers
and the blue-jackets and marines from the ship towards that part
of the beach chosen as the most suitable place for landing. The
weather had changed to some extent during the night, and the surf
on the beach was very heavy&mdash;so heavy, in fact, that it
seemed somewhat rash to attempt a landing, especially as the only
place where the boats could with any probability of safety reach
the shore was very much exposed and very awkwardly situated.
Carefulness and skill, however, prevented the occurrence of any
accident, though the scene presented by the boats, as they
entered the surf and battled with or dodged the great rollers,
was most exciting. The very large boats of the <i>Nelson</i> left
the ship in tow of the steam cutter and the steam pinnace, but
lay-to before the breakers were reached, as any attempt to take
them through the surf would have inevitably resulted in disaster.
Whaleboats, and those well handled, were what were required for
the work, and therefore the orders were that the large boats
should wait outside the surf and disembark their men into
whaleboats and what other small boats were certain of getting
through the surf without accident At the same time an order was
given that the boats landing should follow exactly in the track
of the <i>Nelson's</i> whaleboat, in which were Commander
Henderson (who was in command of the landing party) and several
more of us. This boat led the way, which to the eye of a landsman
seemed as full of danger as any way could be; for there was
nothing in the direction in which the boat was heading but a line
of heavy breakers, with no sign of calm water through which a
boat might pass, and as the boat rose upon the top of the swell
and then swept onwards we could see that the one line of breakers
observed from a distance was in reality a succession of lines,
all of which must be crossed before reaching the shore. Presently
a blue-jacket was noticed running into the water near the beach,
and waving a flag as a signal that the boat was to be steered
towards him, and then mounting to the top of a roller the boat
plunged into the broken water, which curled and tossed and roared
around it, and only ceased its angry grip when it had spent its
fury and was beginning to make way for another great curling
wave, that was coming on behind and threatening to overwhelm
everything in its path. It was only during the very short
intervals between the passing of one breaker and the approach of
another that the boat could now make any progress, and there was
almost every moment the danger of a great wave swamping us; but
careful steering, so as to keep the boat end on to the surf, and
a great effort on the part of the crew to make the best headway
possible at every opportunity, carried us at last through the
danger and into comparatively smooth water, where a hundred
natives or more, submerged to their waists and frantically
gesticulating and shouting, were ready to haul the boat, or to
carry everybody in it to land. The boat, however, had to return
to assist in landing the officers and men waiting outside the
surf, and it was very soon fighting the breakers on its way
seawards, while those persons who had already passed the surf in
it were making their way on the backs of some of the natives, or
wading to the shore. It was a rare sight, this struggle with the
breakers and this strange reception by the natives in the water,
and one to live in the memory; but it was seen in its fulness
only when the boats commenced to plunge into the surf one after
the other. Then the waves, surging harmlessly by the
sharp-pointed whaleboats, would almost swamp the square-sterned
boats, or, striking them on the quarter or the bow, would bring
them almost broadside on to the sea&mdash;a position which
required strong nerves and a skilful hand at the rudder to
prevent them from capsizing. There were very few of those landing
that morning who did not receive a good wetting, and the
Commodore and the officers who came on shore with him were
obliged to wade like the rest</p>
<p>The crowd of natives present afforded the visitors an
excellent opportunity for observing the characteristics of the
Motu Motu population. Instead of a string girdle, the men, who
were fine, big fellows, wore bits of cloth or small grass aprons;
their hair in most cases was cut short and frizzy; and their
head-dresses and ornaments were peculiar, so far as we had seen,
to themselves. The women and girls were very scantily attired,
though most of them wore a kind of grass or fibre petticoat; but
while they do not encumber their limbs with too much clothing,
they practise another method of adornment, and that is smearing
their bodies thickly with oily pigments like coarse red and brown
paint This gives them an exceedingly repulsive appearance; but in
their opinion it is only when they are in this attire that they
are well dressed, and likely to arouse feelings of envy in the
hearts of their female acquaintances, or inspire the opposite sex
with admiration and love.</p>
<p>Quite a crowd of women and girls came down towards the
landing-place to see the strangers and do what they could in the
way of trading. They had nothing to sell but petticoats, and they
were very timid; and therefore, though they were very anxious to
sell the petticoats for the most they would fetch, they were for
some time too frightened of their visitors to approach near
enough to them to barter. It was a very amusing sight to see
these female natives come down from the village in a troop, full
of that curiosity which marks a woman all the world over, and to
observe how, when any of us approached them, they glared at us
and ran from us as though we were wild beasts. Some of the old
men of the place ordered them back to the village; and if their
gestures and the pitch of their voices were interpreted rightly,
though their words could not be understood, they soundly rated
these women and girls for their presumption in leaving their
homes. But, just as most white women and girls would do under the
circumstances, these native females merely scampered back a short
distance towards the village, and then returned with increased
curiosity and desire to see more of their white visitors. They
would not, however, for a long time come near any of us, and
though greatly tempted by the offer of tobacco for the petticoats
they had for sale, if a sale were effected the tobacco had to be
thrown to the holder of the petticoat, and the petticoat was then
thrown in return. Neither the women nor the men could understand
Major Dowding of the marines. His helmet and its spike puzzled
them. Soon after his landing amongst them, he had good-humouredly
lowered his head and pretended to butt at a native, and the whole
community appeared to at once conclude that this was his mode of
attack, and that his helmet spike was a formidable kind of tusk
or horn. So they kept clear of him.</p>
<p>The village was away from the beach, and in the midst of the
cocoanut trees and sago palms. Most of the houses were on props
or piles, but there were some which were built on the ground, and
generally they were larger, and seemed to be cleaner, than those
we had become acquainted with further east. Many of them had
roofs with very large projecting fronts, which pointed outwards
and upwards in the style of a coal-scuttle bonnet. All had
platforms in front of them, on which the natives belonging to the
houses squatted to gossip or smoke; and one, at least, appeared
to be a kind of half-temple and half lodging-house. In this
instance, a roughly carved and painted wooden figure of a man,
more grotesque than natural, and apparently a kind of idol, was
to be seen on the platform under the projecting roof; and near
the door inside the house were a number of what appeared to be
sleeping-bunks, constructed in a manner not unlike what is to be
seen in Chinese lodging-houses. The interior of the house was
very dark, and the only occupant of the place was a
sullen-looking native, with a large head of hair, who did not
show any willingness to give us admission, but who signified
assent when an inquiry was made by signs as to whether the bunks
were used as sleeping-places. The arrangement of the houses was
such as to admit of something like streets, by which the whole
village might be traversed; but the passages which answered for
streets were not very regular, and one sometimes had to go round
a plantation, or dart between a plantation fence and the wall of
a house, or take a rough circuitous path towards the beach, in
order to see all there was to be seen.</p>
<p>The trouble, however, had its reward, for in one quarter of
the village we discovered that among the young girls of Motu Motu
there were several with very comely features and shapely forms,
and at least one who, notwithstanding her dark skin, was a model
of symmetry and grace. It may appear strange to associate a
graceful manner with a black female savage, clothed in nothing
more than a scanty covering of grass or vegetable fibre; but
about this girl's form and movements there was an unmistakable
dignity, and there was no denying her shapeliness. The only
defect noticeable in her appearance was her discoloured teeth;
for, like all New Guinea natives, though not more than fifteen or
sixteen years of age, she was in the habit of chewing the
betal-nut, and her teeth, though regular enough, were dyed an
unsightly black and red. I saw her in the midst of a number of
other girls, who were gazing at their white visitors with great
curiosity, not unmixed with fear, as I was strolling through the
village with one of the <i>Nelson's</i> officers; and, having
some brass toy watches and chains in my pocket, I took one out
and showed it to them, and excited amongst them at once a strong
desire to possess it. By all the signs she could make
intelligible, the pretty girl begged me to give it to her, and
we, enjoying the fun, increased her longing for the gewgaw by my
putting the chain partly around her neck in order that she might
see how well it would look there. Then, seeing that she would be
greatly disappointed if I were to put the toy back into my
pocket, I fastened the chain around her neck, and she was
immediately as vain of her new decoration as a white girl would
be of a new necklace or bracelet, and the envied of all around
her.</p>
<p>It was just at this time that we were startled by a yell from
some of the crowd of natives about us, and, looking to see the
cause, we found that two or three inquisitive females had caught
sight of a white skin on one of my companion's wrists within his
coat-sleeves, and the yell was a cry of astonishment at the
discovery. They could not understand it, and a rush of both sexes
was made to examine our wrists. It was as plain as daylight that
they had regarded our dress as part of ourselves, joined in some
way to our sunburnt faces and hands, and as we turned up our
sleeves and exposed our white arms, and then, to further increase
their wonder, unbuttoned a little of our coats and shirts to give
them a glimpse of our white chests, the expressions of surprise
were long and loud. It could easily be seen how little these Motu
Motu people knew of white men, for on every hand there were signs
of curiosity and wonder. In one part of the village a woman, who
had apparently been confined to her house with her children all
the morning, and had not seen anything of the white strangers,
came out upon the platform before her dwelling to ascertain the
meaning of the noise caused by a lot of passing natives who were
following a number of us wherever we went, and immediately she
caught sight of us she laughed outright at what she doubtless
regarded as our ridiculous appearance.</p>
<p>The firing of guns was entirely new to the whole community.
When the flag was hoisted, and the salute from the <i>Nelson</i>
commenced, the ship was lying too far from the shore for the
sound of the guns to be heard with much distinctness, and only a
low rumble succeeded each puff of smoke; but at the first round
of the <i>feu-de-joie</i> every native in the vicinity of the
flagstaff fell flat upon his face, stricken with
consternation.</p>
<p>But the most conspicuous incident at the flagstaff was the
appearance of a Motu Motu dandy. He arrived very late, for it was
said it had taken him the whole of the morning to dress, and
certainly he must have spent considerable time in adorning
himself. He was physically a very fine native&mdash;tall, well
built, and strong, with a deep brown skin, and his adornments
seemed to be in proportion to his size and strength. He wore a
tremendous headdress of cockatoo and bird of paradise feathers,
above which was a plume made of the shorter feathers of the
cockatoo and parrot, gummed or attached by some other means to a
bit of cane, and in the back of his hair were stuck the long tail
feathers of some bird like a pheasant. Above his forehead, and
beneath his head-dress, his hair was bound round with bands of
small shells. From his ears were hanging enormous earrings,
formed of large rings of tortoiseshell, stitched together with
string, and ornamented at the ends with fancifully cut white
shell, and outside with a long row of kangaroo or wallaby teeth,
the length of each earring being fully six or seven inches, and
the weight five or six ounces. Through the cartilage or septum of
the nose he had placed a long nose-bone; around his neck were
band after band of shells, beneath which were hanging his pearl
crescent and a kind of breast-plate; his arms were encircled by
broad shell armlets, and his ankles by bands of cassowary
feathers. He was vastly proud of his finery, and had he been
armed with bow and arrows, or with spear and shield, he would
have been the nearest approach to the "noble savage" we could
have wished to see; but, according to Mr. Lawes, who, with Mr.
Chalmers, should be the best authority with regard to New Guinea,
there is nothing of the "noble savage" at Motu Motu. Not long ago
the Motu Motu natives made a raid at Redscar Bay, and,
surrounding an unprotected village, the natives of which had done
them no harm, they waited until the women and children had gone
to the plantations, and then, falling upon them, defenceless as
they were, killed fifty of them. This slaughter was followed by
the looting of the village, and then the Motu Motu men returned
to their canoes, carrying with them a young girl they had
captured in the village alive. Even these proceedings were not
the worst that took place during this inhuman expedition, for on
the way back to Motu Motu a dispute arose as to the ownership of
the captured girl, and, to settle the matter, a savage in his
anger seized a bow and arrow, shot the poor girl to the heart,
and threw her dead body overboard.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><span class="uu">A Second Visit to Port
Moresby&mdash;Excursions Inland&mdash;Similarity of the Country
to Australia&mdash;The Native Plantations.</span></p>
<p><span class="aa">From</span> Motu Motu the <i>Nelson</i>
returned to Port Moresby and remained there several days, during
which time she and some of the other war-vessels were coaled from
a collier which had arrived from Newcastle, and a quantity of
coal was landed for the future use of the men-of-war that are to
remain for a time cruising along the coast. This second visit to
Port Moresby was not so interesting as the first The native
village was dull. The male population were still absent on their
trading voyage&mdash;we had, in fact, seen their canoes in the
lagoon at Motu Motu&mdash;and the women and children had become
so used to their white visitors that the novelty of our
appearance had passed off, and they took little notice of us or
we of them. The chief occupation of the women during our second
visit was preparing clay for the making of earthenware
pots&mdash;and this was done by pounding the clay with large
stones into small pieces, and then picking out the bits of stone
and lime&mdash;and shaving the heads of some of their number;
this operation, which was a very peculiar one, being performed
without the aid of lather, and by means of pieces of broken glass
bottle having a very sharp edge. It was during this time that
some of us made the excursions into the country which brought
under our notice the village in the trees and the tribe which
inhabited it&mdash;one of the mountain tribes, and real
Papuans.</p>
<p>One thing in these excursions which attracted the attention of
those of the party who were familiar with the Australian bush,
was the great similarity between the appearance of much of the
country passed over and the country in Australia. There are
palms, large flowering and fruit-bearing trees, and ordinary
forest trees which are unknown to Australians; but, on the other
hand, there is the gum-tree, or eucalyptus, appearing like an old
friend and in considerable quantities, though, so far as we saw,
not in anything like the perfection of growth seen in Australia.
The silver-leaf gum was in some places growing very thickly, and
from a distance a tract of land covered with this
tree&mdash;generally it was growing on ridges or hill
slopes&mdash;wore the appearance of being shrouded in mist. On
the more level land the grass had grown to a considerable height,
and the trees being no more numerous than is the case in what is
known in the Australian colonies as open country, it was not
difficult to indulge in the sport of heading one's horse after
wallabies, which frequently made their appearance in the
neighbourhood of the path, and on being disturbed hopped away to
safer quarters. These marsupials were generally small and of a
reddish colour. The brown wallaby was seldom seen, and in only
one case was the animal of any appreciable size. But it is said
that both the large wallaby and the kangaroo are to be found, and
that the natives kill great numbers by first lighting a line of
fires and then driving the animals towards the fires and spearing
them. The flesh of these marsupials is the only meat the natives
eat, and it is the only meat the missionaries get to eat except
that which they import preserved in tins, for there are no cattle
in New Guinea.</p>
<p>Boating and shooting parties were frequent at Port Moresby
while the ships were at anchor there, and as the south-east
monsoon which blows at this period of the year would freshen
towards evening to something like half a gale, raising a
tolerably rough sea for the boats, the boating excursions and
even visits to the shore were neither uninteresting nor
unexciting. Rambles about the hills surrounding Port Moresby were
also worth undertaking, for it was from the summits of those
hills that the plantations formed by the natives could best be
seen. These plantations, notwithstanding that the season was very
dry, appeared as green and flourishing as though constantly
refreshed by rain, and surrounded as they were by very neatly
constructed fences, formed of small upright saplings placed close
together and securely tied to cross pieces acting as rails, there
was a completeness about them which was very creditable to native
industry. The fences would not be strong enough to keep out
cattle, but they are sufficiently well made to prevent
depredations by marsupials, and kangaroos or wallabies are the
only enemies in New Guinea to native agriculture. In some of the
plantations the more attractive of the trees which were growing
on the land before it was placed under cultivation have been left
standing, with very fine effect, and it is surprising to see how
the soil on a stony ridge or summit of a hill has been utilized
for the planting of banana trees though the stones lying around
are innumerable.</p>
<p>A day or two before leaving Port Moresby the second time,
three chiefs who had been at war at Redscar Bay, and who it was
understood had been concerned in the sale of an extensive tract
of land to a white trader at New Guinea, were brought from their
villages to see the Commodore, and have explained to them the new
order of things with regard to fighting and the sale of land,
which, by the provisions of the proclamation establishing the
Protectorate, will henceforth have to be observed. They were
fine-looking fellows, with great heads of hair adorned with
picturesque head-dresses, and they were quite a feature in the
place during the time they remained there.</p>

Diseases&mdash;Climbing Cocoanut Trees&mdash;Beating the Native

<p><span class="aa">Everything</span> being ready for a departure
eastwards, the <i>Nelson</i> left Port Moresby finally early on
the morning of Monday, November 17, for Hood Bay and the large
native village called Kerepunu, the <i>Espiegle</i> having
previously gone in the same direction for the purpose of picking
up chiefs on the way.</p>
<p>We had seen something of this part of the coast, though at a
greater distance, when the <i>Nelson</i> first sighted New Guinea
on her voyage from Sydney and Brisbane, and therefore it was not
entirely new to us. But we had no distinct acquaintance with Hood
Bay and the large villages around it, and so, as the
<i>Nelson</i> steamed closer towards the land, and the
interesting features of the bay and its villages became apparent,
we were again excited by the prospect of finding something new in
the scenery, people, and incident on shore.</p>
<p>Hood Bay is a remarkable place. The indentation in the coast
which entitles the locality to be called a bay is very slight,
but a reef runs out in a south-easterly direction for a long
distance to sea, and this affords fair protection to vessels
anchoring there. Reefs abound on the coast of New Guinea, and
when steaming into Hood Bay discoloured water seemed to start up
ahead of the <i>Nelson</i> in every direction. But, as easily
handled as a yacht, and with a good look-out in the foretop in
the person of Captain Liljeblad, of the mission schooner
<i>Ellengowan</i>, who piloted the flagship all the time she was
at New Guinea, and with the leadsman constantly heaving the lead,
the <i>Nelson</i> avoided all dangers, and dropped anchor about
two miles from the shore, with the great reef protecting the bay
right ahead of her, the open sea behind, and landwards a long
line of cocoanut and banana plantations bordering the beach and
fringing the background of hills, which were evidently of
volcanic formation, and looked remarkably pretty in a covering of
light green grass, flecked here and there with dark-looking
clumps of trees and brushwood. Kerepunu, the village we were in
quest of, was to be seen on the east point of the entrance to
Hood Lagoon; and in the lagoon, immediately opposite the village,
was anchored the <i>Espiegle</i>, though from the deck of the
<i>Nelson</i> she was invisible, and seemed to have disappeared
in some unaccountable manner behind the cocoanut trees.</p>
<br>

src="1400631h-images/Image06.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>A BANANA PLANTATION.</small></p>
<br>
<p>It was a long pull from the flagship to the village, but a
couple of boats went on shore soon after the ship anchored, and
we were soon in the midst of the natives and their houses.
Seawards there could be observed a number of canoes with the
natives in them fishing off the reef, and on the shore of the
lagoon, opposite the village, native women and children were
returning home from the plantations. The village was close to the
beach, but away from the water, the houses being of a larger
description than is ordinarily met with, and built upon more
substantial-looking props or piles. They were peculiar, too, for
having a very old, weather-worn, and soiled aspect The platforms
in front of the houses were of heavier and more permanent make
than those met with westward, and each house appeared to consist
of two rooms, the one adjoining the platform being quite open,
and the other entered by an aperture doing duty for a door. But
that about the architecture of the houses which most struck the
visitors was the extraordinary form of dwelling used by the
chiefs of the place. These structures were altogether different
from the ordinary habitations, and had in every case a spire
carried above the roof-level to a height of about thirty feet,
and on the top of the spire was a cane with a nautilus shell
stuck upon the point. So curious did all this seem, that the
general appearance of one of these houses was not very unlike the
form of a giraffe, if that animal can be imagined with a dozen or
so of legs instead of four. The body of the animal would then
represent the roofed portion of the house, the long neck the
spire, and the legs the props or piles upon which the house is
built. The overhanging portion of the roof of the house, that is,
the portion of roof that shaded the platform, was ornamented with
the jawbones of pigs, strung together and suspended from the
rafters, and the part of the house in which the chief and his
family lived was approached by a short and roughly constructed
ladder passing upwards from the platform. One chief had the posts
upon which his house rested carved with various devices, one
representing a crocodile or alligator some ten or twelve feet in
length, and so well done that a very good idea was presented of
this pest of all New Guinea inland waters. There were streets in
the village, but with very little regularity about them, and, the
soil being a very dirty-looking sand, there was nothing in the
appearance of the streets pleasant to the eye.</p>
<p>Everything in the village itself presented a dirty,
unattractive aspect; and the condition of the natives made
matters very much worse in this respect, for a dirtier or more
diseased-looking lot of people it would be difficult to find.
They are a fairly large race, and they were attired somewhat the
same as the natives westward&mdash;that is, the men wore the
girdle, though of a different kind, and ornamented their necks
with the crescent of pearl; and the women were clothed in the
grass petticoat, the material of which the dress was made being
in larger strips than at any other place we had visited. But
while most of the men had bushy hair, the hair of others was
short and curly, like that of the negro; and a large proportion
of men, women, and children were suffering from a contagious
skin-disease&mdash;a kind of ringworm which spreads over the
whole body, causes the skin to peel off in shreds, afflicts the
native suffering from it with an apparently constant and almost
intolerable itch, and gives him a decidedly leprous appearance.
As we went further eastward we found this disease existing in
every tribe we visited, but in no instance was it so bad as we
saw it at Kerepunu. It was not at all agreeable to find natives
in this condition approaching us as closely and as anxious to
handle us as natives who had nothing the matter with them, and it
was with some consolation we heard, from those who professed to
know, that this skin-disease never afflicts a white man. The
natives came about us in a crowd, and everything they had for
sale they endeavoured to barter for tobacco, knives, or
tomahawks.</p>
<p>It was a very curious scene in the streets of the village
while they were following the visitors about. Every native in the
place was either in the streets or outside the houses on the
platforms, and their incessant jabber and persistent efforts to
attract attention to what they wished to sell&mdash;in some
instances the articles being of a very paltry
description&mdash;never seemed to grow less. There were many
sullen-looking faces among the crowd; and sometimes a face of
this kind would be seen scowling from a platform, as though its
owner, denying the right of the visitors to come to the village,
refused to have anything to do with them. But, on the other hand,
there were large numbers of men who were very friendly and
good-humoured; and the women, though very ugly and dirty, were
not ill-disposed towards us. It was a relief, however, to get
away from the natives and visit the mission house, which is very
pleasantly situated on some rising ground overlooking the sea,
and in the midst of a well-kept cocoanut and banana plantation.
The heat of the sun and the sandy nature of the soil about the
village had made walking rather tiresome, and it was with quite a
new sensation that some of us stepped over a stile which is in
the place of a gate at the mission plantation, and began to enjoy
the cool shade of the palms above our heads. Very pleasant indeed
it was, and still more pleasant to see the open, cheerful faces
of the native teachers' wives, to eat the luscious bananas which
they brought to us, and to drink a refreshing draught of milk
from the cocoanut plucked but a few minutes before from a
tree.</p>
<p>We had our first experience here of New Guinea natives
climbing the cocoanut trees, and it was an interesting sight.
Taking a piece of rope, a native would tie the ends together so
as to make a loop, which, with his feet inside of it, would
permit of his legs being extended just wide enough to give his
feet a good grasp of the tree. Then, clasping the tree with his
hands, he would draw himself upwards, his feet being raised
together and stretched to the limits of the rope, and hands and
feet alternately holding fast to the tree, until the full height
of the long, straight, branchless stem had been climbed, when the
cocoanuts wanted would be broken from the bunches growing
immediately under the leaves and thrown to the ground. Other
natives would then take pointed sticks and wrench the husks off,
and a smart tap or two from something heavy around the top of a
nut would in a few seconds make an opening, and, revealing the
pleasant-tasting beverage within, strongly tempt one to
drink.</p>
<p>We saw the belle of the village at this mission station. She
was not handsome, or pretty, but she had a cheerful countenance,
was tall and well made, tattooed rather elaborately, and wore
necklaces of beads and shell armlets; and though somewhat shy,
she was not averse to making our acquaintance.</p>
<p>We left the mission station and the village shortly before
dusk; but prior to embarking in our boats we learned something
interesting with regard to the native drum, an instrument formed
of a piece of hollowed wood shaped like an hour-glass, but about
three feet long, ornamented with feathers and string, and covered
at the ends with snake or iguana skin. One of the officers of the
<i>Nelson</i> possessed a boar's tusk, which was so good a
specimen that it formed almost a complete circle, and every
native in the village coveted it. Eventually he gave if away in
exchange for the finest greenstone axe we saw during our stay at
New Guinea; but before this axe made its appearance, almost
everything any one native possessed was offered for the tusk, and
among the articles offered were several drums. But though the
natives offering these drums were willing to barter them for the
tusk, they would not on any account permit any of the white
visitors to beat them. They watched assiduously, and any attempt
to tap the covering of the drum, however slightly, was carefully
prevented. At first this could not be understood, but afterwards
the natives managed to make us comprehend that if a white man
were to beat the drum it would be the cause of some one dying in
the village; so the drums, all the time we were there, were
silent.</p>

<small>AMONG THE COCOANUTS.</small></p>
<br>
<p>The <i>Nelson</i> anchored off Kerepunu on the afternoon of
November 17, and the chiefs of Hula, Kamala, Kalo, Kerepunu, and
Aroma, representing a large number of the villages and probably
twenty thousand natives, all of the Hood Bay district, were
brought on board the flagship to receive presents, and to have
the Protectorate explained to them. The interview was a very
interesting one, and will in all probability result in the
establishment of very much improved relations among the natives
over a large and important part of New Guinea. All the New Guinea
tribes are warlike, and some of them are almost continually
fighting with each other, but one of the objects in view in the
establishment of the Protectorate is peace among the natives
themselves. If the constant condition of disquiet in which each
tribe lives can be changed to a state of security from attack and
injury at the hands of its enemy, a great improvement in the
general condition of the tribes on the south coast will have been
effected.</p>
<p>The principal chief among those brought on board the
<i>Nelson</i> at Kerepunu was a great fighting chief, and one of
the finest men we had seen. The missionaries said he was the
finest chief they knew in New Guinea. His name was Koapena, and
he was a chief of Aroma. He was well made, muscular, and strong,
and, notwithstanding his light copper-coloured skin and large
head of hair, a handsome fellow. His features, slightly pitted
with smallpox, were aquiline, his nose well arched, and mouth and
chin full of decision and firmness. His broad shoulders and arms
were tattooed with blue marks, which represented the number of
people killed by himself in fight; sixty-three were counted,
besides many other marks which represented the enemies killed by
his tribe. He wore armlets and small ornaments in his ears, and
his hair was decorated with the scarlet blossoms of the hibiscus.
In every respect he looked a splendid man; and his companion
chiefs had more character about their features, and more bearing
about them in their general appearance and in their movements,
than any of the natives who had up to that time trod the
<i>Nelson's</i> decks. They listened to what the Commodore had to
say through the interpreter, and then they began to deliberate
among themselves. One old chief of Hula, who was somewhat
doubtful of the new theory of life which the Protectorate was
seeking to establish, asked, "In the event of Kapa Kapa" (near
the neighbourhood of Hula) "attacking us again, are we to
understand that we are not to pay it?"&mdash;that is, be
revenged. He was told, "Most certainly not." "Very good," he
said; "but just tell me who is to do the payment?" Then the
Commodore said that her Majesty's officers would see that justice
was done. But this did not appear to satisfy the chief until the
matter was explained to him by Mr. Chalmers in a manner better
understood by the natives, that payment in the way of punishment
or revenge would be administered by the Queen's officers, and
then the chief signified that he was content. "Now," he said,
"there is to be peace for ever, and I am satisfied so long as
somebody will punish those who do wrong." Mr. Chalmers put the
question to him again, and said, "Now, is it to be peace for ever
and for ever?" "Yes," he answered; "it is peace for ever."</p>
<p>After the meeting of the chiefs, some firing from the big guns
and the Nordenfeldts of the ship took place, and the chiefs, who
were impressed by the display, began talking amongst themselves
of their past desires and their efforts to be the friends of
white men. One old chief, against whom something was mentioned
concerning an attack on a Chinese junk and the murder of several
Chinamen&mdash;not entirely undeserved, the missionaries
say&mdash;stood up and said, "If there have been error in the
past, there must be an end to it now and for ever;" and the Hula
chief put up his hand and repeated, "For ever and for ever."</p>
<p>The British flag was hoisted in the village early on the
following morning. The flagstaff had been erected in the midst of
the houses, and in a kind of quadrangle which was named "Espiegle
Square," a board with this name painted upon it being affixed to
the platform of one of the houses; and the assemblage at the
ceremony of the reading the proclamation of the Protectorate and
hoisting the flag was a very interesting and picturesque one. The
naval officers wore their cocked hats and epaulettes, the
blue-jackets and marines were in white dress and straw hats, the
crowd of natives was very much larger than had been present at
any previous ceremony, and the attention to detail in the general
arrangements for the occasion was as marked as it was at Port
Moresby. The Commodore and the officers who landed with him in
his barge from the <i>Nelson</i>, together with Mr. and Mrs.
Lawes and Mr. Chalmers, stood upon one of the platforms at one
side of the square, a sail having first been stretched over the
platform to shade them from the sun. The native teachers and
their wives seated themselves before the platform, and
immediately in front of them were ranged the fine-looking chiefs
of the Hood Bay district, with Koapena, the fighting chief of the
Aroma, among them. He stood in the centre of this group, holding
the stick of office that had been given him by the Commodore the
day previous in his right hand, and his lime gourd in the other;
and on either side of him were ranged his companion chiefs with
tufts of green leaves stuck in their armlets, and armed as for
war with shield and spear.</p>
<p>These shields, made of wood, shaped something like the figure
eight, covered with a neat kind of matting, and ornamented with a
fringe of bright-coloured feathers and string, were worn on the
left arm, and allowed to rest on the left thigh, while the
long-barbed spear was held in the right hand, the point of the
weapon sticking in the sand, and the shaft inclining to the
chiefs right shoulder. It can easily be imagined with what
attractiveness the grouping of these native chiefs had been
arranged; and when it is said that from this group the
blue-jackets and marines branched off into the hollow square
formation, that around the troops, and on every house platform in
the square, and along the whole length of the village street, the
brown forms of the natives congregated like bees, and that the
uniforms of the officers present, and the colours borne by the
colour-party who had landed with the troops, were particularly
gay in the bright morning sun, it can be understood that the
spectacle was one well worth witnessing. All that is then wanted
to fill in the whole picture is, the attention of the natives
while the proclamation is read and interpreted; the sudden fright
and headlong disappearance of many of them into the recesses of
their houses at the sound of the first gun saluting from the
<i>Espiegle</i> the appearance on the flagstaff of the Union
Jack; the rattle of the small arms firing the <i>feu-de-joie</i>;
the strains of the National Anthem; and the final British cheers,
led by Captain Bridge, for the Queen.</p>

<br>
<small>HOISTING THE BRITISH FLAG.</small></p>
<br>
<p>Then the troops fell back a few paces, and room was made for a
war-dance, or an exhibition by the armed chiefs of the native
method of fighting. Suddenly darting from where they had been
standing, some of them rushed forward at an imaginary enemy,
their shields raised as though to defend themselves from flying
weapons, and their spears firmly grasped and quivering as they
were poised ready to be hurled at the first glimpse of the foe:
There was no war whoop, for the native warfare in New Guinea is
carried on by stealth; only a low exclamation was now and then
heard as though the forms of some of the enemy had been seen, and
increased exertions were necessary to cope with them; and in that
fashion the chiefs&mdash;those who commenced the attack being
quickly joined by the others&mdash;ran this way and that, from
the shelter or concealment of one imaginary tree or rock to that
of another, now crouching to the ground as though creeping upon
an unwary enemy, and then standing erect, and with all the
strength of the right arm making the stroke, which in real
warfare would send the spear whizzing on its deadly mission
through the air. The rapidity of movement on the part of these
chiefs was extraordinary, and their darting from side to side
either in the supposed chase of an active enemy, or to dodge his
weapons or divert his aim, showed they possessed in a remarkable
degree the qualifications considered in their warfare to be
essential to victory. But interesting as this display of fighting
tactics was to the visitors, it was in a large measure a
delusion, for the New Guinea natives are not brave warriors.
There are, of course, exceptions; but the general body are (to
use a term employed by Mr. Lawes in an address he delivered on
board the <i>Nelson</i> on the Sunday preceding her return to
Sydney) "sneaking murderers." They covet the tattoo marks, which
show that they have killed some one, as ardently as a British
soldier or sailor covets a medal, but not with the feelings of
brave men. They will watch for weeks to get behind an enemy and
pounce upon him unawares, and then, capturing him, all the young
men of the village will stick their spears into him, and return
home glorying in the deed. Or they will lie in wait for the women
and children of a village, and falling upon them suddenly,
slaughter them remorselessly. Mr. Chalmers on one occasion
remonstrated with a chief for the part he had taken in a massacre
of this kind, and told him that white men considered it the
greatest cowardice to injure a woman. The chief was astonished at
the idea, and, laughing derisively, exclaimed in his own
language, "What fools you are! Don't you see that if you kill the
women you prevent the birth of any more warriors?"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><span class="uu">Queensland. Labour
Vessels&mdash;Escapees and Returned Natives&mdash;A Tragic
Story.</span></p>
<p><span class="aa">At</span> the time the <i>Nelson</i> left
port to proceed along the coast eastward she had on board
twenty-six New Guinea natives, who had been recruited by labour
vessels for the Queensland sugar plantations. Their story, as
narrated by them, was a very tragic one. On the return of the
<i>Nelson</i> to Port Moresby from the west, it was ascertained
that a schooner named the <i>Elsea</i> had arrived from Thursday
Island with a large number of New Guinea natives on board in
charge of a Government agent, and the Commodore was soon
afterwards officially informed by the agent of the arrival of the
schooner, and of the nature of her passengers. Ten of the natives
were men who, on being taken to Queensland, were rejected as
being physically unfit for sugar plantation work, and therefore
had to be returned to their homes; and sixteen of them were
runaways from, it would appear, a plantation somewhere in the
vicinity of the Johnstone River, a place they had escaped from in
two boats to Murray Island, in Torres Straits, the passage
occupying several days.</p>
<p>On the 12th of November Commodore Erskine held an inquiry in
the mission school-house at Port Moresby, for the purpose of
hearing the story of these natives from their own lips and having
it taken down in writing, the natives being examined through
interpreters, and in the presence of the Rev. W. G. Lawes and the
Government agent on the <i>Elsea</i>. One native, who had been
taken by a labour vessel from Milne Bay, stated that when he
consented to go in the vessel, he understood that he was to be
away from his village for only three moons&mdash;one moon to be
spent on the passage to and from Queensland; that he was to
receive clothes and hatchets in return for this; and that if he
and the others had known how long they were really to be away
they would never have gone. When questioned as to how the white
men treated the natives at the places they called at while he was
on board the labour vessel, the answer was, that as long as they
were within reach of the missionary they were not cruel, but when
away from mission influence or supervision they got guns, etc.,
burnt the villages, and took the men away by force. At Bentley
Bay, he said, they took a woman and boy from a village; but at
Teste Island the woman escaped by letting herself down from the
vessel by a rope, and swimming on shore. The manner in which the
woman was obtained was this: When the natives on shore were
holding one of their feasts, the woman and boy were captured, and
the two boats of the vessel pillaged and burnt the village, both
boats being armed. There was no cause, the natives said, for this
outrage. At another place, when the natives refused to go on
board a labour vessel when asked to go, rifles were got to make
them do so. The natives then ran away, but the crew of the vessel
fired at them from the boats, and several women were killed At
Normanby Island the natives came off from the shore in large
canoes to trade, and when alongside they were fired upon. The
natives in terror crowded to one side of the canoe and capsized
it, and swam for the shore; but boats were at once lowered from
the vessels, and the natives chased, with the result that nine
were taken alive, and three were shot dead, one of those captured
being among the number to be returned to their home by the
Commodore. The bodies of the natives who were shot were washed
ashore.</p>
<p>At another village the natives would not go on board the
labour vessel, and armed themselves with spears, and the white
men armed themselves with rifles. One white man was wounded by a
spear, and a native was shot dead. At other places no wrong was
committed, and the natives were engaged in return for hatchets
and other articles of trade; but at a small village on Harris
Island a native was shot because the white men were angry with
the natives for asking too much trade. At this island it would
appear that there were seven natives in a canoe, and that one was
shot dead. The canoe then made off, but the boat of the labour
vessel chased it, caught it, and took the remaining six natives
on board the vessels and kept them there. One of them was
wounded, and though he was cared for on board the vessel, he died
from the effects of the wound. Of the remaining five one was
among the natives examined by the Commodore, and the others are
said to still be in Queensland.</p>
<p>The story of those who had escaped from Queensland was, that
when they were landed in that colony from the labour vessel, and
found they had to work for three years, they wept bitterly, and
they ran away from the plantation because so many natives were
dying, and because they were beaten. Having reached the Johnstone
River, each party seems to have stolen a boat, one of the boats
being owned by a Chinaman, and having in it two bags of potatoes.
These potatoes served the natives for food, and for water they
filled a number of empty bottles which they had stolen from the
plantation. The boats reached the sea at daylight in the morning
after starting down the river, and Murray Island was made in six
days after leaving the Queensland coast. The second boat arrived
there on the 17th of October last. On being asked by the
Commodore how they liked the plantation work, the answer was that
in their own land they could work well, but on the plantation it
was all cry and work. They only got food in the morning, and had
to work all day, and in the evening they were too tired to eat. A
native said to the Commodore, "If we can be taken back to our own
land we shall be very glad; but if our countrymen left behind in
Queensland could be sent home too, we would be very thankful, and
when you come back to our country we will give you plenty of
pigs."</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of doing all that could be done to
have these natives returned to their homes, and their friends and
tribes made to understand that henceforth they would be protected
from recruiting vessels, and anything else that might do them any
injury, the Commodore decided to remove them from the
<i>Elsea</i> to the <i>Nelson</i>, and to send them to their
homes by one of the men-of-war. This was a fortunate thing for
the master and crew and the Government agent on board the
<i>Elsea</i>, for at this time of the year sailing vessels
frequently get becalmed at the east of New Guinea, and if the
<i>Elsea</i> had found a tribe of hostile natives who had
suffered from the visits of labour vessels, and were to be
becalmed at the time, the consequences to the <i>Elsea</i> might
have been very serious. The <i>Elsea</i> certainly would have had
great difficulty in returning the natives to their homes, for
some of the places from which the natives were taken are known to
the missionaries only by name. One of the escapees was a chief
from Moresby Island, and when the Commodore asked him if he
wished to say anything to him, the chief said, "If you take us
back to our homes we should be glad, but we want our countrymen
back. There are plenty left in Queensland, and we are anxious
that they should be brought back."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><span class="uu">The Man-catcher&mdash;Death
of a Noted Chief&mdash;Amazon Island&mdash;Enchanting
Scenery&mdash;The Chief of the Village&mdash;Natives in
Mourning&mdash;An Interesting Ceremony.</span></p>
<p><span class="aa">When</span> the men of a native village
resolve upon fighting the natives of some other village, they set
out in an irregular party, and attack secretly, generally from
behind trees. Besides their spears and bows and arrows, they have
greenstone clubs, fitted securely on stout wooden handles, some
of the clubs being star-shaped, and others flat and round, with a
smooth sharp edge, and they have a very cruel-looking instrument
called a man-catcher. This consists of a cane loop with a long
handle, from which projects within the loop a sharp wooden prong
several inches in length. Sometimes the cane forming the loop is
decorated with bits of string or fibre, which gives it the
appearance of being ornamented with ribands, and to a great
extent masks the real purpose of the instrument But in the hands
of a native on the war-path the man-catcher performs the duty of
a lasso, and thrown over the head of a flying enemy, who may be a
woman or a child, the loop falls to the shoulders, the flight of
the unfortunate being is suddenly checked, and with the check the
back of the neck is brought violently against the prong, which is
apparently sharp and strong enough to pith the captive as a
bullock is pithed in the shambles. It may be, however, that a
spear or an arrow brings the fugitive to the ground, and then
with a rush the pursuer is in a moment upon his fallen enemy; in
another moment he has with one hand seized him by the hair of the
head, while with the other he takes from his mouth a
bamboo-knife, which by his tearing away a strip with his teeth at
once acquires an edge as sharp as that of a razor, and before the
poor wounded native has time to crave for mercy, or even to utter
a cry, his head is off, and his conqueror carrying it in all its
ghastliness away with him.</p>
<p>On one of the peaks of the Macgillivary range of mountains,
near Hood Bay, there is the village of a mountain tribe who have
built their houses inside and around what is evidently the crater
of an extinct volcano, and so carefully has the village been
planned for strategic purposes that the position of some of the
houses has obviously been chosen so that they may be used as
places from which a constant look-out can be kept, and any
attempt on the part of an enemy to surprise the village
prevented. This romantically situated village has been, it is
said, the scene of many a native fight, a neighbouring
tribe&mdash;the Kalo natives&mdash;having tried time after time
to capture it; and recently it was the cause of the death of a
noted warrior chief, whose native name was Vali, but who was
known to the missionaries as Saul. About eighteen months ago the
Kalo people went inland to the mountain village, and managed to
capture a man and a girl, who were immediately decapitated, and
their heads taken to the sacred place in the Kalo village, where
they were displayed to the gaze of the populace. It so happened
that the girl was the daughter of a chief of the village in the
mountains, and the chief declared that the murder of his daughter
could only be followed by more blood, and that he would have no
peace between his tribe and the Kalo people. The consequence was
the murder of Saul only a few days before the <i>Nelson</i>
reached Kerepunu. A large number of the Kalo natives were out
hunting the kangaroo, and being observed by the mountain tribe,
who quickly signalled to tribes adjacent to them, the Kalo men
were surrounded. They were warned by some Kerepunu natives of
their danger, and most of them were able to escape; but Saul
refused to run away. He possessed two heads, and he was a great
warrior; and he and a cousin remained. His courage, however, did
him no service. He was very soon the target for many spears, and,
falling with the spears sticking in him, his head was cut off by
the very chief whose daughter had been murdered, and his warrior
tattoo marks were savagely hacked from his body. When a chief has
killed his enemy he remains secluded in his village for several
days. He is sacred for the time, and neither pays nor receives
visits, and no consideration will induce him to violate this
custom.</p>
<p>From Kerepunu H.M.S. <i>Espiegle</i> visited Toulon Island in
Amazon Bay. Amazon Island is the name by which this island is
generally known, for the reason, it is believed, that when the
place was first visited only women were seen there, the men being
at the time away on the mainland, either in the plantations or
fighting. Mr. Chalmers' first experience of the locality was,
however, sufficient to convince him that there was certainly some
ground for the idea which had got abroad that the place was
peopled by Amazons, for he had scarcely landed before some of the
women ordered him back to his boat; and when their signs to him
to depart were not heeded, they simply took hold of him, and,
leading him to the boat, compelled him to go away.</p>
<p>The island is a lovely spot, small, but in some aspects not
unlike Yule Island, for it has the same kind of beautiful light
green hills rising above the dark foliage of the cocoanut palms
and the luxuriant forest vegetation which fringe the beach and
grow in the recesses which divide the hills. The water, where it
laves the sand, and for some distance out from the
island&mdash;to the limit, in fact, of the coral reef which
surrounds it&mdash;is of a brilliant light-green colour and as
clear as crystal, and through its transparent depths can be seen
unlimited stores of marine treasures lovely enough to deck the
daintiest fairy's bower. Out at sea a reef rises so close to the
surface of the water that the waves passing over it break into
foam; and in the vicinity of this reef were several large
fishing-canoes under sail. Landwards and quite close to the
mainland were some small islands with breezy-looking cocoanut
trees upon them; and then behind, separated from these islands by
narrow passages of water, the coast range of mountains&mdash;not
alone, not one line of upheaved land running along the coast like
a solitary and almost unbroken ridge, but standing as in the
front rank of a battalion of mountains, and as though to show how
insignificant it and its immediate companion ranges were in
comparison with the majestic Owen Stanley range, which, rearmost
of all, shot its peaks upwards far above everything, until they
penetrated even some of the higher belts of cloud and seemed like
distant islands in a misty sea.</p>
<p>Toulon Island is not far from Cloudy Bay, and a short time ago
an affray took place between the Cloudy Bay natives and the crew
of a <i>beche-de-mer</i> schooner, with the result that one of
the white men received a severe spear-wound, and several natives
were killed or wounded. As the natives of Toulon Island belong to
the same tribe as those at Cloudy Bay, it was thought by Mr.
Chalmers that the islanders might regard the <i>Espiegle</i> as a
man-of-war come to punish them for the affair at Cloudy Bay, and
might resist any attempt on the part of the boat's crew to land.
It was therefore decided that two boats should land, each armed,
the first to convey Captain Bridge and Mr. Chalmers ashore; and
the second, under the command of Lieutenant Ommanney, to lie off
from the shore as a covering boat, until it was seen that
everything was safe.</p>
<p>There was something more than ordinarily exciting in the going
ashore in an armed boat; but, as things turned out, there was no
necessity for arms, and we did not see the sight that would have
been worth seeing&mdash;a crowd of savages yelling their threats
and cries of defiance as the boats approached the land, and then
launching a cloud of spears; and finally the whole body of them
running helter-skelter and tumbling one over the other in their
frantic efforts to escape into the bush from the rifles of the
blue-jackets. Instead of that, the canoes came off in a peaceful
way to trade, and we were received in a friendly manner on shore;
but, until we saw the first canoe coming out from the land to
meet the <i>Espiegle</i> as she was approaching the island, there
was no saying what our reception was likely to be, and a native
teacher who was on board with us was directed to get into the
rigging and explain to the natives in the canoe what we were and
what our mission was, so that it might be understood at once that
we were friends. Very soon after we had anchored, a fleet of
canoes were around the ship to trade, and curios, including a
tolerably large supply of bird of paradise plumes, were to be had
on every hand for a few sticks of tobacco.</p>
<p>The village was situated in a lovely little cove sheltered on
one side by an extraordinary mass of dark rock, which formed in
one place a romantic, natural archway, backed by a hill covered
to its summit with tropical vegetation; and on the other side was
a second hill, with its slopes and the ravines upon its side
studded with palms. The beach was for some distance lined by a
fleet of large double canoes, each rigged with a mast and stays,
and one covered in as with a roof or cane awning, and all with
their sides ornamented in such a manner that they appeared to
have painted ports. The houses of the village were close to the
beach, but for the first time in our experience none of them
faced the water. The fronts of the houses seen on approaching the
land were the other way, and when we had landed and got into the
midst of the village we found that it consisted of one long,
narrow street, with houses on either side, facing inwards to the
street, and built in a style very similar to what we had seen at
Kerepunu, but rather higher in the roof and more pointed. Behind
the houses, and at either end of the village, the cocoanut trees
were growing, and the taro and yam plantations were to be found
beyond the cocoanut trees, and in the rich alluvial soil about
the hills. The natives were numerous, and sat upon the platforms
in front of their houses, or followed us about the village. The
hair of the men was in many instances very short, cropped close
to the head, while in others it was rather woolly. When it was
worn long it was decorated with plumes of cockatoo feathers, and
sometimes with a red blossom from the hibiscus, worn over each
ear, Many of them wore the ordinary girdle, but a few, and
notably the chief of the village, wore a band of cords and cloth.
He was attired also in a head-dress of shells, and in cane
armlets, the one on his right arm being ornamented with a bunch
of green leaves and with a long broad streamer or riband, which
hung almost to the ground. Through his nose was a circular shell,
and around his neck a band of small red shells, to which were
appended some strings of small coloured beads and a large boar's
tusk. But that which was most noticeable about the male portion
of the population of this village was the number of men that were
in mourning, and these had, according to the custom that prevails
all along the coast, coloured the whole of their bodies an
intense black, and adorned themselves with dark ornaments. It was
said that the natives of Toulon Island are continually fighting
the mountain tribes, and that this accounted for so many men
being in mourning; but we learned also that there had been
several recent deaths of an ordinary character in the village,
and that these had thrown many of the natives into black.</p>
<p>I do not remember to have seen in any village along the coast
a female native in mourning, and certainly, unless they had some
mourning dress not noticeable to strangers, there were none in
any but the ordinary everyday attire on Toulon Island. This
ordinary attire was remarkable for its dimensions, for so very
large and bulky was the grass or fibre petticoat that it
suggested in some cases the presence of a crinoline, and in
others the adoption of a style similar to that which is seen in
the dress of a ballet-dancer. Tattooing appeared to be practised
very extensively among the women, but they were not attractive in
any respect, and in many instances their children were suffering
from the skin disease which was so widespread at Kerepunu, or
from loathsome sores.</p>
<p>The chief of the village came off to the ship, and returned to
the shore in Captain Bridge's boat. When the shore was reached,
Captain Bridge and Mr. Chalmers, with a native teacher connected
with the New Guinea Mission, were conducted to the house of the
chief, and Captain Bridge was accommodated with a seat on the
platform. Then the population of the village were assembled, and
Captain Bridge, addressing them, said:</p>
<p>"I have come here to tell you that Queen Victoria has sent one
of her great chiefs, the Commodore, to proclaim that this part of
New Guinea is henceforward to be under the protection of Great
Britain. The Commodore has already proclaimed the Protectorate at
several places, and he has now gone further east with four
men-of-war, one of them many times as big as the man-of-war in
which I have come here. This is the meaning of what is being
done: The people of New Guinea will be protected by Queen
Victoria; no one, whether a white man or not, will be allowed to
take your land from you;' no one will be allowed to injure your
wives or children; no one will be allowed to take you against
your wishes away from your homes. There is to be no war between
your tribes and any other; and if you have any misunderstanding
with any other tribe you are to refer the matter to the first of
Queen Victoria's officers who may come to your country. Fighting
will certainly bring punishment on those who begin it. You are to
treat all white men whom Queen Victoria may allow to dwell
amongst you in a proper manner, and any injury done to them will
be punished. If you have any complaint to make against a white
man, you are on no account to act against him yourselves, but you
are to make it known to the captain of a British man-of-war, or
other white chief, as soon as possible. If any person comes to
ask you to buy firearms, gunpowder, or intoxicating liquors, you
are not to buy them, but are to make known the matter to the
first British man-of-war you see. If any white man wants you to
sell your land to him you are not to do so. Queen Victoria wishes
you to become her children, and that you and your wives and
little ones may be peaceful and happy. You are to look upon all
of the chiefs whom she may send to you as your friends. Her
chiefs will always be friendly with those who behave well, and it
will be their duty to punish those who wilfully do wrong."</p>
<p>The natives listened very attentively, and when the remarks
from Captain Bridge had been interpreted to them by the native
teachers, they were evidently well pleased with what was being
done by the Commodore. They were more particularly pleased with
the intimation that fighting was to cease. The teacher told them
that Queen Victoria had sent Captain Bridge to say that for the
future they must not fight with any one, and on no account must
any one fight with them. They were told, also, that they must not
on any account sell the land; to which they nodded their heads in
acquiescence, and said, "Good, good;" and that they were always
to look upon a man-of-war, when it came there, as their friend.
Then the Cloudy Bay affair with the <i>beche-de-mer</i> schooner
was mentioned, and they began to show some signs of excitement,
and to talk and gesticulate very much. But the chief said that
now they would regard everything as peace, and he glanced upwards
two or three times while speaking, as though he were appealing to
heaven to witness what he was saying; and he concluded by
repeating, "Now it is peace all along." He was given a present,
consisting of a very large butcher's knife, a tomahawk, and some
sticks of tobacco.</p>

Coast-line&mdash;The Native Villages&mdash;Driving a
Bargain&mdash;Thievish Habits of the Natives&mdash;Native
Burial&mdash;Suspicion as to the Real Object of the
Protectorate&mdash;Some of the Results from the Visits of the
Labour Vessels.</span></p>
<p><span class="aa">In</span> the afternoon of the same day as
that of the visit to Toulon Island the <i>Espiegle</i> rejoined
the <i>Nelson</i>, the <i>Raven</i>, and the <i>Swinger</i>, in
Argyle Bay, the approach to which opened out to the view a
panorama of very lovely scenery. Numbers of islands dot this part
of the coast, and as one after another came in sight, with its
leafy hills and its clusters of cocoanut trees, its sandy beaches
or dark rocks, with their border of white surf, all standing out
in bold distinctness from a majestic background of blue-tinted
and cloud-capped mountains on the mainland, the scene was a very
attractive one. On the westernmost side of the entrance to Argyle
Bay is Du Faure Island, a large island with hills upon it of the
prettiest green, and a curious mass of rocks, so formed in the
water that they should be a wonderful place for sound and fury
when a storm is at its height and the waves are high; and over to
the east there is the tiniest rocky islet, with three or four
cocoanut trees growing upon it, appearing in the ocean as an
oasis must appear in a desert, and yet so diminutive that the
rock and its few palms seem little more than a delicate etching
on the sky.</p>
<p>When right inside the bay the ships were completely landlocked
in a harbour where the hills rose high from the water's edge,
covered with vegetation to their summits, and where the harbour
water found its way around jutting points of land and through
island passages in such a manner that the prettiest little nooks
were to be discovered in all directions; and in the seclusion and
peacefulness which these inlets afforded the cocoanuts grew, and
the natives of the place had built their villages. The villages
were small, and the houses were so constructed that some of the
roofs were considerably depressed in the centre, while in others
the gable ends were very much peaked. They were close to the
beach, and in the midst of dense vegetation, in which the
cocoanut palm and the breadfruit tree were conspicuous among
forest trees of great variety and beautiful foliage.</p>
<p>The male natives wore a strip of banana tree bark, and the
women a dress formed apparently of several of their grass or
fibre petticoats placed one over the other, a style of fashion
which imparted to them a very bulky appearance. The hair of the
men was mop-like, though not by any means so much so as was the
case at Port Moresby, and in their hair were stuck long wooden
combs, with handles in some instances more than two feet long,
and ornamented at the end with a bit of fibrous material which
was blown about like a piece of riband. Many of them had painted
broad black lines across their foreheads and faces, and had cut
in the lobes of their ears large holes, in which they had placed
pieces of banana leaf or tortoise-shell earrings. One fellow we
saw had his face and chest quite black, as though he were in
mourning. The women wore their hair twisted into very small
ringlets, and they were tattooed very elaborately in lines across
the face and about the body, and as a rule appeared healthy and
robust and not bad-looking, but a number of them were suffering
from the usual skin disease. They were full of curiosity
respecting their strange visitors, though most of them, on the
occasion of our first visiting a village, very carefully
refrained from approaching too near to us. I remember bargaining
with one for the purchase of a basket; but, in consequence of her
aptness for trade, it was some time before I could effect an
exchange for the tobacco I was offering, and when I did succeed
my skill in driving a bargain appeared to so charm a big male
savage who had been looking on that he laughed outright, and,
throwing his arms around me apparently in admiration of what I
had done, absolutely hugged me&mdash;a proceeding to which I was
obliged to submit, as he was a strapping fellow, and carried in
one of his hands a formidable-looking tomahawk, circumstances
which might have made any resentment on my part somewhat serious
in its results.</p>
<p>Another incident in which one of the <i>Nelson's</i> party was
concerned, besides being amusing, showed the thieving
propensities of the natives. He had taken ashore, among other
articles of trade, a number of pipes, and had endeavoured to
exchange some of them for curios, which the natives, however,
valued more highly than he was disposed to consider fair. So he
refused to part with his pipes, and returned with them, as he
believed, on board the <i>Nelson</i>. But on examining his
pockets he discovered that, while he had been protesting to one
native against the exorbitant price he was asking for what he was
willing to sell, some other natives had quietly picked his
pockets and cleared them of every pipe he possessed.</p>
<p>It was at one of the villages of Argyle Bay where we first saw
any very definite signs of the manner of native burial. We had
seen two or three small patches of ground fenced round in a very
ordinary way in front of some of the native houses at Port
Moresby, and had understood they were graves; but at Argyle Bay
the graves of the native dead were much more distinct, and
greater attention appeared to be paid to them. They were quite
close to the house, fenced round with fresh saplings, and shaded
by palm branches, and they were regarded as sacred from the
approach of strangers. One grave was close to a large tree, in
the lower branches of which were the remains of a kind of
platform covered with decayed palm leaves, as though they had
formed a temporary resting-place for a body before it was placed
in the ground near the foot of the tree; but we could not get
intelligible information from the natives on that point All a
native would do, when asked by signs what had been in the tree,
was to indicate that there was some one buried within the sapling
fence near the tree, and by a shake of his head and a warning
movement of his mouth hint to us that we had better go away. A
string was stretched around one of the graves, and whenever a
string is seen around a grave it must be avoided, or great
offence may be given to the natives of a village. Under no
circumstances, it is said, must any one ever pass under the
string. If a white man visiting a village should accidentally
discover a grave protected in this manner, or should even
approach quite close to the string before he is aware of its
presence, he does well to retrace his steps, for such a
proceeding as that would at once indicate to the natives that the
visit to the grave was unintentional, and that there was no
desire on the part of the visitor to show it any disrespect.</p>
<p>The proclamation of the Protectorate was read, and the flag
was hoisted at Argyle Bay on the morning of November 20, on the
beach of an inlet where there were only a few native huts, but
where the flag would be in full view of any vessels anchoring in
the bay. The locality was mountainous, and covered with luxuriant
and beautiful foliage, but it was in general appearance somewhat
like Middle Harbour, in Port Jackson, and the view from the beach
towards the fleet at anchor was unique in its loveliness. From
this little sandy nook one could see the headlands and the
islands, the mountains and the foliage, and the brilliantly
tinted water, all of which had formed such an attractive scene
when the vessels entered the harbour the previous day, in a new
aspect. With the altered position in which these constituents of
the original view were now before the eye, the scene had changed
as a picture changes by a turn of the kaleidoscope, and new
beauties had sprung into existence with the new combination and
arrangement.</p>
<p>There was a tolerably large assemblage of natives present, and
they were very attentive to what was read to them by the
Commodore and by the interpreter. The latter, however, did not
appear to be as intelligible to his audience as the interpreters
at previous places had been, and a sullen-looking chief rose in a
threatening mood with other natives from where they had been
sitting, and, walking over to the interpreter, he addressed him
in words which, from his manner of speech, seemed to be a
peremptory demand for an explanation of something they had not
understood. There was evidently in the minds of some of the
natives a suspicion that the real object of the visit of the
ships of war might not be what the Commodore explained through
the interpreter; and as labour vessels had been, it was said, at
Argyle Bay, there was doubtless some ground for suspicion,
especially if, as was probably the case, the only vessels these
natives had ever seen were the labour vessels and the men-of-war.
The recollection of the incidents connected with the visits of
the labour vessels must indeed have been fresh in the minds of
many of these natives, for before the conclusion of the ceremony,
one chief suddenly took to his heels and ran away into the bush;
and another, who had been taken on board the <i>Nelson</i> to
receive a present, being suddenly seized with the apprehension
that he was to be taken away, jumped through one of the ship's
ports into the water, swam to a canoe, and returned to the
shore.</p>

<p class="negindent"><span class="uu">The Mission Station at
South Cape&mdash;Cloudy mountain&mdash;Attack on the Mission
Houses&mdash;A Terrible Time&mdash;Signs of Cannibalism&mdash;A
Horrible Present&mdash;Decorated Human Skulls&mdash;Picturesque
Native Graves&mdash;The South Cape Canoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="aa">Soon</span> after the ceremony at Argyle Bay
the squadron left for South Cape, near which there is a large
mission station, the first established on the coast eastwards of
Port Moresby, and six or seven years ago the residence of the
Rev. J. Chalmers. South Cape is not on the mainland; it is on
Stacey Island, and the island is separated from the mainland by a
very narrow water passage. The harbour where the ships anchored
is, in some respects, as Argyle Bay was, very much like the New
Zealand Sounds. The land bordering the water is high and steep,
and is covered with dense vegetation to the water's edge; the
arms or branches of the harbour spread in different directions,
and appear to lose themselves among the hills; and wherever a bit
of sandy beach exists, there a small community of natives have
built their houses, among the cocoanut trees, and made the place
their home.</p>
<p>But the most conspicuous objects at South Cape are Cloudy
Mountain and the mission station. Both are full of interest. The
mountain ascends precipitously almost from the water to a height
of 4600 feet, clothed with a dense tropical foliage, and having
its summit wrapped in a thick veil of cloud, which is very seldom
dispersed by the wind sufficiently to afford a glimpse of the two
or three peaks around which it clings so tenaciously and in a
manner to make the mountain a grand object in the general view
which meets the eye at this part of the coast. The mission
station is situated on that part of Stacey Island nearest to the
mainland, on a point where the beach is backed by lofty green
hills, and washed by the waters of the narrow passage dividing
the island from the hills on the mainland. There, on a spot where
the beauties of tropical nature abound, and where an air of
peacefulness and the contentment of a simple life seem to brood
over the place like a blessing, the neatly constructed, cool
mission houses stand, enclosed in a well-made fence of small
saplings, and so situated that native villages are on either side
of the mission compound, in the same condition, so far as outward
appearance goes, as the villages seen elsewhere, but in their
close proximity to the mission appearing to cling with affection
to their new protectors. In the garden around the mission houses
the cocoanut and the bread-fruit tree are growing, with other
fruit trees indigenous to New Guinea, and others again, such as
the orange, introduced from elsewhere; and among the trees and
about the mission houses the brown forms of the
natives&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;are continually
moving, and imparting variety and animation to the scene.</p>
<br>

<br>
<small>A VILLAGE NEAR SOUTH CAPE.</small></p>
<br>
<p>A visit to the mission house where the principal native
teacher and his wife are living, will find a juicy pineapple just
brought from the garden, and cut into tempting slices, and some
cocoanuts resting upon drinking-glasses, with the milk in the
nuts ready to quench the thirst as only this cocoanut milk in a
perfect condition, and in a burning climate like that of New
Guinea, can quench the thirst, and at the same time prove itself
a wholesome beverage; and between eating the pineapple and
drinking from one of the cocoanuts, the visitor may, if Mr.
Chalmers be present, listen to the wild early history of the
station, when the natural peacefulness of the place was turned,
by the hostility of the natives, and their determination to
murder the missionaries, into a pandemonium with hundreds of dark
fiends continually besieging the station and thirsting for the
missionaries' and the teachers' blood, and only the arm of
Providence to protect the little band shut up in the mission
house. One can scarcely believe that only six or seven years ago
the fence&mdash;which, though good enough as an ordinary means of
enclosing a house or garden, seems but a very frail protection
from attack&mdash;withstood the repeated efforts of a crowd of
determined savages to get into the mission house; that during the
peril and anxiety of the time, when the savages, baffled in their
efforts to storm the place in a body, would lurk about the
confines of the garden, and in the very garden itself, waiting
with the stealth and ferocity of wild beasts to spring upon their
victims and murder them the moment the opportunity presented
itself, a Scotchwoman, the devoted wife of Mr. Chalmers, since
deceased, was there; that, at last, the anxiety, the want of
rest, the incessant alarms, the ever-threatening danger, became
so unbearable that it was determined to put an end to such a
state of existence by fighting the savages, and subduing them, or
perishing in the attempt, death appearing to all to be far
preferable to what they had to endure. Yet so it has been, and
the circumstances of the time were so fraught with peril, the
defence of the mission house was so stubborn, and certainly in
its way so heroic, and the triumph of the brave little company in
the end so complete, that on becoming acquainted with the story
one can hardly fail to be reminded of those verses of the
Laureate which so graphically describe the perils, the anxieties,
the long-sustained defence, and the final triumph of another
little British band who, though not employed exactly in the same
work as the New Guinea missionaries are engaged in, were like
them fighting for the same cause and under the same flag.
Changing the words which describe the instruments and the methods
of fighting employed on the occasion referred to by Tennyson to
those which would picture the weapons and manner of fighting
common to the New Guinea savages, there is in the following lines
a not inapt description of the state of existence which Mr.
Chalmers and his wife and their companions&mdash;a few native
teachers and friendly New Guineans&mdash;experienced:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<div style="margin-left:35%; font-size:90%;">"We can fight,</div>
<div style="font-size:90%;">But to be soldier all day and be
sentinel all thro' the night,<br>
Ever the mine and assault, our sallies, their lying alarms<br>
Bugles and drums in the darkness, and shoutings and
soundings</div>
<div style="margin-left:10%; font-size:90%;">to arms.</div>
<div style="font-size:90%;">Ever the labour of fifty that had to
be done by five,<br>
Ever the marvel among us that one should be left alive!"</div>
<br>
<p>There was no one marching to the relief of the mission house;
there was no way of escape or of obtaining assistance; the perils
of the time had simply to be borne. But thanks to the few "kindly
dark faces," who were faithful through all, Mr. Chalmers was
always warned when danger was imminent, and he and his wife and
those with them remained unhurt. But when human nature could
endure no more, and when a warning more earnest than any which
had preceded it was received that he and his wife and their
companions should at once try and escape in the little mission
vessel, as the savages had met together in one of the villages
and determined to murder them the following day, Mr. Chalmers saw
that the crisis had arrived and something decisive must be done,
and then it was that the decision to fight was arrived at. There
were firearms in the house, though they had not been used, and
every gun was loaded. Then placing the teachers in positions
where they would be able to make the best defence possible, Mr.
Chalmers threw open the doors of the house, and confronting the
savages, called upon them to fight or disperse, and threatened,
if they refused to do one or the other, that he would shoot the
first man among them who at any time attempted to pass the fence.
In the excitement of the moment, his words and demeanour were so
passionate and resolute that the savages were cowed. They
blustered and threatened, and there was a movement among some of
them as though they were going to attack him there and then; but,
on his again warning them, they seemed to see that he was
terribly in earnest, and at last they withdrew to one of the
villages to hold a council. Soon afterwards, it was made known to
Mr. Chalmers that the natives had decided to let him be for the
present, but they wanted him and those with him to leave the
island. This he was determined not to do, even if it were
possible, which it was not; and, recognizing the fact that by his
show of determined resistance he had evidently impressed the
natives with some sense of his power, he sent back a reply that
he intended to stay where he was, and that he would have no peace
with the natives until they dispersed and returned to their
homes. Eventually they did disperse, and though for some little
time afterwards the inmates of the mission house did not dare go
far from the house because of the danger they were in of being
assassinated, the relations between the natives and the mission
people gradually improved, and now all that remains on the island
of the perils of the time I have been describing is the memory of
them.</p>
<p>All the way along the coast from Argyle Bay to South Cape we
had found the scenery on the mainland very mountainous and very
pretty, and in many places the shore was fringed with cocoanut
plantations and other evidences of the presence of native
villages. Inside the harbour at South Cape the villages were
small, but they peeped out in a charming manner from the little
inlets in which they had been built, the charm of their situation
being greatly enhanced by the hills which rose behind them, and,
except where the natives had cleared the land and placed it under
cultivation, were clothed luxuriantly with trees and shrubs from
base to summit.</p>
<p>The natives indulge in little ornamentation of dress, but they
have the reputation of either being or having been cannibals; and
we very soon began to find about their houses human skulls,
thigh-bones, and other remains of cannibal feasts. We saw no
signs of recent feasts, but the skulls and bones were so
displayed in front of the houses, and some of the natives
possessing the skulls and bones could so graphically describe by
signs what had been done with the flesh that had been upon them,
and to what part of the human body the bones belonged, that
cannibalism must have been practised about South Cape not very
long ago. It is certain that the natives of some of the villages
around this locality are at the present time cannibals&mdash;that
they eat human flesh, whenever they fight and succeed in
capturing any of their enemies; and Mr. Chalmers can describe how
on one occasion his late wife was brought as a special present a
piece of a human breast, wrapped in leaves, and carried in a
basket. An incident so horrible to civilized people as that is
equalled only by another of this gentleman's missionary
experiences in New Guinea among cannibals, when he saw, on
landing at a certain village, fully a dozen fresh skulls, which
had just before his arrival been detached from as many bodies
that had been devoured at a great cannibal orgie. One cannibal
tribe he has been in the habit of visiting invariably asked him
when he went among them to show them his breast, and for a time
he did so, but immediately he discovered that the breast was
regarded as a choice morsel at their cannibal feasts, he took
care to keep his shirt and his coat closely buttoned. Yet he
thinks the cannibal natives are the finest of fellows when you
get to know them, and says that once they become friendly with
you they will go through fire and water to serve you. Some of the
human skulls hung before the houses at South Cape were decorated
with cowrie shells, and in one or two places were seen the stone
pavements which are understood to be the places upon which the
bodies intended to be eaten are received by the chiefs before
being prepared for cooking.</p>
<p>The natives about the mission house were ordinary-looking
creatures, with some attempt at dress visible in their costumes;
but those of the women who had been induced to wear calico gowns
would have looked much better without them, for, inasmuch as they
retained their grass petticoats under the gowns, their appearance
was that of a lot of animated misshapen funnels. In their usual
dress, both the male and the female natives were attired
similarly to the natives we had observed elsewhere; but in
general appearance, many of the men were fierce, sullen-looking
fellows, and some of them would be found lying upon the floor in
the dark interior of a house, and as we approached glaring at us
with the expression of a savage watch-dog. The roofs of the
houses were in many instances of that description which is
considerably depressed in the centre, and peaked at both ends,
and each of the houses appeared to be divided by a mat into two
compartments, the one fronting the platform being used by men,
and the other by women and children.</p>
<p>Close to many of the houses and near the beach were small
plantations containing banana trees, the mammy-apple palm, a few
tall cocoanut trees, and perhaps a splendid specimen of the
croton which we found growing to great perfection at several
parts of the coast; and in the centre of these plantations were
graves. Nothing of the kind could have been prettier, nothing
more appropriate; nothing could show more respect for the dead.
The simple untutored savages of this part of the coast had laid
their dead to rest in situations and amid surroundings fit for
the last resting-places of poets. Each grave was enclosed within
a fence of small logs, and this was roofed over with a roof
similar to those of the houses, but smaller and more
picturesquely constructed; and in some cases the grave was not
only covered by a roof, but was shut in like a vault with walls,
the material for both roof and walls being the leaf of the
pandanus, used as a kind of thatch. At the principal end of the
roof, that which was evidently the entrance to the grave, large
white cowrie shells were hanging in bunches or singly&mdash;in
some instances down both sides of the front from the
gable&mdash;and in such a manner as to impart to the structure a
very ornamental and yet chaste appearance; and the ground in the
immediate proximity of the grave was carefully strewn with stones
and pebbles. Then around the plantation was a substantially
constructed stone and wood fence, with wooden uprights, upon
which were stuck numbers of cocoanuts, apparently as offerings to
the spirits; and about the fence some shrubs and plants, several
of them bearing flowers, were springing up so thickly as to
promise that before long they would completely hide the stones
and the logs in their verdant embrace. How pretty and how
peaceful all this looked may be understood by any one who can
imagine the high-wooded hills on every side; the water of the
harbour, which, except where it rippled on the beach, was bluer
than the bluest sky; the loving manner in which the palms seem to
cluster about the grave, and, while shading it from the rays of
the sun, sighing a <i>requiem</i> as the wind rustled their
leaves; and the sacredness of these graves to every native in the
village. In some cases the graves and their surroundings were of
a humbler kind than I have tried to describe&mdash;in one
instance, everything was similar to what we had seen at Argyle
Bay; but however humble they were, they showed signs of receiving
careful attention, and in all cases they appeared to be regarded
as hallowed ground.</p>
<p>Two things at South Cape which were new to us in our
experience of natives along the coast, were the manner in which
these natives expressed surprise, and the elaborate decoration of
some of their canoes. The first visit of a canoe to the
<i>Nelson</i>, and the first conception of her enormous size,
were instantly followed by a prolonged cry like a shrill
"Oh-h-h-h!" and wherever a boat's crew went for the first time
the natives would give vent to this peculiar cry of astonishment.
If we passed a canoe, the number of men in our boat, and their
style of pulling, and probably also the boat itself, would at
once cause the cry to be raised by the natives as they paddled
by, and if we landed it was just the same. They were evidently
struck with amazement at their strange visitors. They came about
the ships in large numbers to trade, and it was through this
circumstance that we were able to see what we did of their
canoes. Many of the ordinary canoes had a line of streamers
stretching from two upright sticks placed one at each end of the
canoe, and at the outside edge of the outrigger. These streamers,
which were similar to a line of small flags, were simply pieces
of sun-dried palm leaf like that of the pandanus, but they had a
very attractive appearance as they fluttered in the wind,
especially as each of the upright sticks from which they were
stretched had upon its point a large and handsome shell. Other
canoes were ornamented with rows of large white cowries, a style
of ornamentation, however, which was far more extensively adopted
in the case of trading canoes. These canoes were very large, and
they were not merely a huge hollowed-out log with an outrigger,
but the log had carved ends and high topsides, the latter made
from planks cut, probably, from the sides of old canoes, and
securely sewn to the sides of the hollow log, and then apparently
caulked in some rough manner. This has the effect of making the
canoe very roomy, and enabling it to carry a very large number of
natives and a considerable quantity of trade, and as the outside
of the canoe is painted white or limewashed, with some devices in
red to relieve the unbroken white colour, it has, with its
strings of cowrie shells at the bow and the stern&mdash;ninety or
a hundred shells being hung at each end&mdash;a very interesting
appearance, and when its mat sail is set it travels through the
water with great rapidity. One of these canoes, in the desire of
its crew to make fast to the <i>Nelson</i> after sailing in from
sea, gave us an exhibition of the quickness of the natives in
overcoming difficulties. There was a strong current running where
the <i>Nelson</i> was lying, and the natives in the canoe failing
to catch a rope thrown to them from the ship, the canoe began to
rapidly drift by, which meant that it must either beat up to the
ship again or abandon the idea of getting alongside. Equal to the
occasion, however, one native leaped from the bow of the canoe
into the water, and, swimming towards the ship, caught the end of
the rope that had been previously missed, while another native
leaped into the water from the canoe with one of its ropes, and
the two natives meeting in the water the ropes were joined, and
the canoe was hauled alongside the ship without further
difficulty.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><span class="uu">Returning Native Labour to
their Homes&mdash;Remarkable and Affecting Scene&mdash;Joy to
some Homes, and others left in sorrow&mdash;how the labour
Vessels entrap the Natives.</span></p>
<p><span class="aa">At</span> daylight on the morning of Sunday,
the 23rd of November, the <i>Espiegle</i> left Stacey Island in
advance of the <i>Nelson</i>, bound for Basilaki or Moresby
Island, with seventeen of the natives from Queensland, whose
homes were on Moresby Island, and on Sunday afternoon the vessel
anchored in Hoop Iron Bay. There was immediately a remarkable and
affecting scene between the natives on the vessel and their
friends and relatives on shore. The seventeen natives and others
who are said to be still in Queensland, had been given up by
their friends for dead, and their relatives and friends were in
mourning for them. In some cases, so long had the returned
natives been away that the period of mourning by their friends
had expired, and their possessions had been divided amongst those
entitled to share them, and the revulsion of feeling when it
became known that seventeen of those who had been given up for
lost had returned may be imagined. As the <i>Espiegle</i>
anchored, an old native, the chief of Moresby Island, already
mentioned, was seated on a hammock, gazing earnestly at the
shore, and presently a canoe containing a man and boy approached
the ship. A recognition occurred instantly, for it afterwards
transpired that the man in the canoe was the chiefs brother; and
when the canoe came close to the ship, and its occupants boarded
the vessel, tears from the three natives flowed copiously, and,
rushing to meet each other, they fell one upon the other's neck,
rubbed noses, gave expression to loud wailings, and manifested
other signs of sorrow and joy. Captain Bridge and Mr. Chalmers
took the chief ashore, and there a still more affecting scene
took place. The chief appeared as though he had determined to
play the stoic and not exhibit too much feeling, and so, when he
stepped from the boat on to the beach, he folded his arms and
stood looking at the houses of his village and at the natives on
the beach before him. He had stood, however, but a few seconds
when his eyes overflowed again, and he burst into tears. Then,
the astonishment amongst the natives at his reappearance giving
place to joy on his return, his friends, full of that strange
mixture of joy and grief which is common to all mankind, crowded
around him, and several women, weeping bitterly and making the
air resound with their wailings, threw their arms about him. The
whole of the natives then sat down upon the beach, and weeping
and wailings were continued for perhaps a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>Later on in the day the remainder of the returned natives were
taken on shore, and then the weeping and cries of joy and grief
were much greater. There was a large crowd of natives on shore
anxiously waiting for the boat to reach the sand, but nothing was
said or done until the boat had touched the beach and a boy of
about fourteen had got out of the boat. Then the wailings and
demonstrations of joy began, and the boy was seized at once by
several women, who hugged and wept over him. While this was
taking place the other natives conveyed ashore in the boat were
landing their little possessions in the way of luggage, and until
they had completed this they were not interfered with. But the
moment they had got all their luggage out of the boat they were
set upon, and then the weeping and wailing became extraordinarily
loud, and was no doubt partly due to the grief of those whose
friends were not among the returned, and are still in Queensland,
if they have not died there.</p>
<p>When the chief was landed in the morning, some of the natives
said to Mr. Chalmers, "Where are the other boys? You have brought
joy to some homes, but some are left in sorrow." They were told
that they had better come to the Commodore and see him personally
about it; but they were frightened, and refused to leave the
island in any vessel. One native who has a son in Queensland
implored Captain Bridge to bring the boy back to his home. "Now,"
he entreated; "go to-day, and we will fill the ship with pigs."
Both Captain Bridge and Mr. Chalmers did all they could to induce
this man to leave by the <i>Espiegle</i>, in order that he might
tell his story to Commodore Erskine, but without success, and a
movement of the screw of the vessel caused him to suddenly dart
through one of the portholes of the vessel into a canoe, from
fear that there was to be an attempt to take him away by
force.</p>
<p>Grieved as many of the natives were, however, at the fact that
some of their friends had not been brought back, they were all
rejoiced more or less at the return of those landed from the
<i>Espiegle</i>, and they tried to express their gratitude by
every means in their power. They shook the hands of the boats'
crews, patted them, smiled, and talked, and before the
<i>Espiegle</i> left they sent on board to Captain Bridge a
present of a large pig and yams, taro, and sago. The statement of
the returned natives with regard to the period for which they had
engaged themselves was corroborated by the natives of the
village. They all said they had engaged for three moons only;
they had not been kidnapped&mdash;they had gone away of their own
free will, but only for three moons, and they went in order to
get a tomahawk and bags of trade. They had been kept away so long
that their friends had given them up for dead, and now looked
upon them as having been brought back from the grave.</p>
<p>During the day Captain Bridge had some chiefs brought on
board, and he explained to them through Mr. Chalmers and a native
interpreter concerning the Protectorate, and read the
proclamation. The names of sixteen Moresby Island natives still
in Queensland were given to Captain Bridge, and when they were
given the chiefs begged him to get these natives returned. The
chiefs were too fearful of also being taken to Queensland to
leave in the <i>Espiegle</i> for Dinner Island, where the
<i>Nelson</i> was lying, but they were very earnest in their
pleadings for the return of their absent people; and how very
earnest they were was apparent not only from their actions and
their words, but also from the circumstances that at night, while
there was great rejoicing in the houses of the natives who had
been brought back, there was in other houses which were still
desolate nothing but weeping.</p>
<p>The Commodore is very strongly of opinion, as the
missionaries, Mr. Lawes and Mr. Chalmers, are, that the natives
when engaged by the labour vessels were under the impression that
they would not be away from their homes more than three months,
and he has probably reported this to the Admiralty, arid at the
same time conveyed to the Governor of Queensland his conviction
that, inasmuch as the natives were not properly acquainted with
the period of time they were expected to serve in Queensland,
they were engaged under false pretences. This may lead to the New
Guinea natives now in Queensland being returned to their homes
before their usual period of service expires.</p>

Scene&mdash;A Labour-vessel Incident&mdash;The Killerton

"Swinger."</span></p>
<p><span class="aa">H.M.S.</span> <i>Nelson</i> left South Cape
early on the morning of Sunday, November 23, for Dinner Island,
the <i>Swinger</i> and the <i>Dart</i> going a short distance
ahead in order to take soundings on the way, and act as pilots.
The route taken on leaving the South Cape anchorage was not that
by which the squadron had entered the harbour from sea, but
between Stacey Island and the mainland. It is characteristic of
the New Guinea coast that although coral reefs abound, the water,
wherever a channel exists, is very deep; and so, though the
passage between the point on Stacey Island, where the mission
station has been established, and the mainland immediately
opposite is exceedingly narrow, the channel is as safe to a
well-handled vessel as an open seaway. For some miles the course
steered lay between the mainland and a number of picturesque
islands, all of which showed evidences of population wherever a
bit of sandy beach or a secluded nook was to be seen; and though
after these islands were passed there was a stretch of open sea
for the ships to cross, we soon came upon more islands, and early
in the afternoon we reached our intended anchorage.</p>
<p>We found Dinner Island a very pretty spot, small in size, but
well cultivated, with palms and banana trees in plenty, and
fringed with a beach of white sand and the lovely water tints
produced by an adjacent coral reef. The island owes its name to
the circumstance of Captain Moresby and some of his companions,
during the cruise of H.M.S. <i>Basilisk</i> on the coast, landing
there on one occasion to dine; and close by are the Hayter and
Heath Islands, on the former of which Captain Moresby hoisted the
British flag. Dinner Island belongs, it is understood, to the
London Missionary Society, who are said to have purchased it from
the natives for a very small sum of money represented by "trade,"
and there is a mission station there.</p>
<p>The natives on these islands were in general much the same as
we had seen at South Cape and Argyle Bay; but those who assembled
on board the <i>Nelson</i> on the Sunday evening for the usual
ceremony of eating rice, hearing the Protectorate explained, and
receiving presents, were a very poor-looking lot of people. A
number of them connected in one way or another with the mission
station wore clothes&mdash;in most cases coloured
shirts&mdash;but one or two were dressed in trousers as well as
shirts. The remainder were nude, with the exception of the
covering around the waist. The only ornaments they wore were an
armlet on the right arm, earrings through the lobes of the ears,
and the usual comb stuck in their hair. Some of the canoes used
by the natives of these islands were larger than any we had seen,
and elaborately ornamented at each end with cowrie-shells. One
made from the trunk of an enormous tree, with top sides and a
very large outrigger, was found drawn up on the beach at Heath
Island, and well protected from the sun by a rudely constructed
shed. This canoe was capable of accommodating a very large number
of natives, and must have been built for the purpose of conveying
the warriors of the village on their fighting expeditions.</p>
<p>On Heath Island we saw for the first time evidences of fever
among the people; but there was nothing surprising in this, when
we noticed that the village where the natives suffering from this
fever were observed was situated on very wet, ill-smelling, low
land. Skulls and other human bones were hanging about the houses
in several of the villages; but while the natives either were or
had recently been cannibals, they had not neglected to cultivate
the ground about their houses, and well-kept plantations of
cocoanuts, bananas, sugar-cane, yams, and taro were to be found
in many places.</p>
<p>On Dinner Island we saw a little girl who, four years ago, was
rescued from cannibals on Hayter Island. There are two accounts
given of her discovery and her rescue, and though they differ in
certain of the details, they are each sufficiently sensational,
and clearly show the barbarity of the New Guinea cannibals. One
story, and that which is commonly told, narrates how the child
was saved at a time when she was being tossed from one savage to
another, in order that she might be made giddy before her throat
was cut by a savage, who was standing close by with a knife
waiting to commit the murder. But the second account of the
incident, which was given me by Mr. Chalmers, contained no
reference to the tossing of the child, though it is quite as
revolting in other respects. According to Mr. Chalmers, the child
and her mother had been captured by the cannibals, and the child
had witnessed the murder of her mother and the cooking of a
portion of the body for the cannibal feast, when the party were
surprised by the arrival on the scene of a white man, who, with
some companions, had landed to shoot on the island. The uncooked
head and some other parts of the body of the murdered woman had
been placed in a basket, while the trunk was made ready and
cooked for the feast, and the poor child was close by, a
terror-stricken witness to all the terrible proceedings.
Horrified at what he saw, and fearing that the cannibals would
kill and eat the girl also, the white visitor determined to
rescue her, and, if necessary to effect his purpose, fire at and
kill the chief who was present. Firearms, it so happened, were
not needed, for the natives were willing to part with the girl
for some tomahawks, and, the exchange being effected the child
was taken to Dinner Island, where she has remained ever since.
She is now a well-grown girl of fourteen years of age, and is
known by the name of Mary. What her fate would have been if she
had not been rescued from the cannibals, it is not easy to say.
Mr. Chalmers' opinion is that she would not have been killed; she
would have been adopted by the chief and kept as one of his
children, and a husband found for her when she arrived at a
marriageable age. Cannibals, according to his knowledge of them,
do not kill children; but whether this be so or not, Mary is far
better off at the mission station on Dinner Island than she could
have been by remaining with the inhuman wretches who murdered and
ate her mother.</p>
<p>The ceremony of reading the proclamation and hoisting the flag
was performed early on the morning following our arrival at
Dinner Island. The flagstaff was erected near the beach, in the
midst of the cocoanut trees, and not far from the mission house;
and as there was as much attention to detail in the ceremony as
there had been at the most important places we had previously
visited, the scene was both interesting and picturesque. When the
ceremony had concluded, Commodore Erskine, Captain Bridge, and a
number of other officers, visited the mission house, and there
lying upon a table was found a singular memento of the visits to
New Guinea of the notorious labour schooner <i>Hopeful</i>. It
was a Wesleyan hymn-book, given, it was understood, by the master
of the schooner to one of the teachers at Dinner Island, and
underneath the name of the donor was the inscription "From the
above to Eboneza, for having explained to recruits the Queensland
agreement, May 18, '84." With a knowledge of the doings of the
<i>Nelson</i> along the New Guinea coast, and the presence on the
<i>Nelson</i> of some of the victims of the evil practices
resorted to by that and other labour vessels, the visitors could
only regard the hymn-book with astonishment.</p>
<p>Very soon after the ceremony at Dinner Island the
<i>Nelson</i> was on her way again eastwards, her destination
this time being the Killerton Islands. The <i>Swinger</i> had
sailed earlier for Milne Bay, for the purpose of returning to
their homes some of the natives who had been transhipped to the
<i>Nelson</i> at Port Moresby from the schooner <i>Elsea</i>,
With our departure from Dinner Island, the fine weather which had
almost uninterruptedly attended our proceedings began to show
signs of changing to rain, and it was not long before the wind
became squally, and the atmosphere so thick with moisture that it
was deemed prudent to stop the engines of the <i>Nelson</i> until
the weather had cleared and land could be seen again.</p>
<p>The course was through the China Straits, with the mainland
and the islands on either side quite close enough for us to
observe, when the atmosphere was sufficiently clear, that there
was a greenness and a luxuriance about the grass and the
vegetation much more pronounced than we had noticed westward.
This circumstance, and the fact that the rain began to fall
frequently and heavily, seemed to indicate that the rainy season
was setting in; but Mr. Chalmers informed us that rain falls on
this part of the coast almost continuously, or, as he put it, for
eighteen months out of every twenty-four, and doubtless this
almost constant downfall accounts for the particularly fertile
appearance which this part of the coast presents.</p>
<p>There is nothing specially attractive about the Killerton
Islands. That on which the usual ceremony of hoisting the flag
took place was a very small coral island, covered with coral
sand, and having upon it a mission station. Palms of various
kinds and banana trees grew round about the mission houses, and
in that respect the island was pretty; but there was not about it
anything of the interest which the lofty hills, the rich natural
foliage, and the picturesque inlets along the line of beach had
created at other places. Fruit and vegetables, however, were
plentiful, and bananas, mammy apples or paw paws (which are very
much like the rock melon), mangoes, a kind of custard apple, and
yams and taro, were procurable in large quantities, and very
cheaply. The mission houses were of a kind somewhat different
from what we had previously seen. The principal house was
constructed of pandanus thatch, and round about this house were a
number of small huts the walls of which were formed of some kind
of fibrous bark, stripped probably from the pandanus or the
banana tree, and fastened to. a light framework of wood. These
huts were peculiar in being of two stories, the upper story,
which was reached by means of a log, with huge notches cut upon
it for steps, being evidently used as a sleeping apartment, as
the floor was neatly matted, and the room contained a bed and
some plain but neat arrangements for the toilet.</p>
<p>That building, however, which attracted most notice from the
visitors was one close to the beach, giving shelter to some
wounded natives. There had been a fight, I think, the very day
before our arrival. A hostile tribe of natives on the mainland
had attacked some of the natives of the Killertons, and three men
belonging to the mission island had been seriously wounded in
several places about their bodies with spears. We saw them with
their families in the hut or shed which the mission teachers had
set apart for their use. The building looked very new, and
probably had only recently been erected. Small saplings had been
put closely together for walls; the roof was of the usual thatch;
and the floor was the clean-looking coral sand of the island. The
structure had an exceedingly neat appearance, and there was such
an air of innocence and simplicity about its occupants,
particularly in the aspect presented by the women and children,
who were evidently very sorrowful and anxious respecting the
condition of the wounded men, and these men were so quiet and
patient, that it was impossible not to feel sympathy for them.
All were seated upon the floor, the wounded natives leaning
against something placed to support their backs and give them
ease, and one of these poor fellows was so unfortunate as to have
spear-wounds in the arm, the side, and the thigh.</p>
<p>The native tribes in the neighbourhood of the Killerton
Islands are very warlike and bloodthirsty, and many of them are
cannibals. In fact, fighting and cannibalism are said to be
frequent in several localities along this part of the New Guinea
coast. So warlike, indeed, are some of the tribes, that one chief
not long ago sent a challenge to Captain Marx, of the
<i>Swinger</i>, offering to fight that vessel; and during our
stay at the Killertons it was stated that some of the natives on
the mainland had been threatening to fight and to capture even
the <i>Nelson</i>. The courage of the chief who challenged the
<i>Swinger</i> disappeared when he saw that vessel commence
target practice with some of her guns; but the fact that the
challenge was sent, and that the threat with respect to the
<i>Nelson</i> was made, shows how natural fighting is to these
people. The flag was hoisted early on the morning after our
arrival from Dinner Island, and was left in the charge of the
principal native teacher, who was instructed by the Commodore to
hoist it whenever a ship came to the islands; and two copies of
the proclamation were given him, so that all white persons who
visited the place might know what had been done, and that the
islands and the coast of the mainland were now under the
protection of Queen Victoria.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><span class="uu">In the midst of
Cannibals&mdash;A Cannibal Feast&mdash;Cannibal Chiefs on board
the "Nelson"&mdash;An Interesting Interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="aa">It</span> has been already mentioned that
three of the <i>Elsea</i> natives were returned to their homes at
Milne Bay by H.M.S. <i>Swinger</i>, Captain J. L. Marx. The visit
of the <i>Swinger</i> to Milne Bay proved as interesting as that
of the <i>Espiegle</i> to Moresby Island, for it gave us an
introduction to cannibals surprised almost in the very act of
feasting on the bodies of some of their enemies. We had for
several days been in the region of cannibalism, and had found old
skulls and human leg-bones hanging at the entrances to and inside
the native houses; but we had seen no sign of any recent cannibal
orgie, and were therefore considerably interested when the
<i>Swinger</i> rejoined the <i>Nelson</i> at the Killerton
Islands, with a cannibal chief on board who had so recently been
gorging himself with human flesh that sufficient time had not yet
elapsed for him to have been able to digest his horrid meal.</p>
<p>Milne Bay is peopled with cannibals, and very little
intercourse has taken place between them and white men. They are
constantly at war, one tribe with another, and those who are
killed or taken prisoners are invariably cooked and eaten. On the
morning of the <i>Swinger's</i> visit the Rabi natives had been
fighting with another tribe, and had killed two men and one
woman. The bodies of the two men they had cooked and eaten just
before the <i>Swinger</i> arrived; the body of the woman they had
thrown away&mdash;not because it was not likely to prove as
palatable as the others, but because the others had proved
sufficient to satisfy for the time their inhuman appetite.</p>
<p>A few hours' earlier arrival off the place would have revealed
to Captain Marx and Mr. Chalmers the whole process of
cannibalism&mdash;how the bodies, when brought from the scene of
the fight, were put over a fire and singed; how the chiefs of the
war-canoes which had been instrumental in killing the three
natives had the singed bodies brought before them, while they sat
on a kind of stone pavement to receive them, as it were, in
state; how the chiefs then directed the bodies to be cut up; and
how they were then cut up, and the various portions cooked by
being boiled in pots (which are never afterwards used), or
wrapped in banana leaves and roasted on hot stones; how the men
of the tribe, in order to prepare themselves for the feast,
shaved off a part of their hair and painted their faces
hideously&mdash;first an intense black, and then relieving this
blackness with a series of white lines down the forehead and nose
and round the eyes; how the tidbits&mdash;the breast and the
shin-bones, the latter because they are full of marrow&mdash;were
handed to the chiefs, and the other portions, except the heads,
to the rest of the savages; how the skulls were cleaned and hung
up as trophies at the doors of the chiefs' houses; and how, amid
all the excitement attending these proceedings, the women and
children stood by, equally excited, but, in accordance with
custom, not sharing in the feast All this might have been seen,
for according to the best accounts it is an exact description of
what takes place at the cannibal ceremony which the natives
engage in; not so much, it appears, because they like the taste
of human flesh&mdash;though they do like it, and say that the
flavour of pig is nothing to it&mdash;but because of their
insatiable longing for revenge. In the case under notice a
neighbouring tribe attacked the Rabi people three months ago, and
killed and ate one of their number, and the fight and cannibalism
on the morning of the <i>Swinger's</i> appearance were the result
of the previous enmity.</p>
<p>When the <i>Swinger</i> had approached as near the shore in
Milne Bay as safety would allow, a boat containing Captain Marx,
Mr. Chalmers, and an interpreter, left the vessel, in order to
land at a village and induce the chiefs of the place to come on
board the <i>Swinger</i>, so that they might be taken to the
Killerton Islands and witness there the ceremony of proclaiming
the Protectorate and hoisting the British flag. The appearance of
the natives on shore was suspicious, even before the boat left
the ship. A commotion could be observed among them. The boys and
girls were sent into the bush, and then the women, carrying as
many of their household goods as they could manage to take with
them, followed. It was evident that the man-of-war was regarded
as a vessel come to punish them for some misdoing. Many of the
men also disappeared; but others came down to the beach, unarmed
as far as could be seen, but in all probability having their
spears within easy reach in the bush behind them. Observing all
this, the <i>Swinger</i> steamed in a little closer to the land,
so as to be able to assist the boat if the natives on shore
should prove hostile, and the interpreter was directed by Mr.
Chalmers to get into the bow of the boat, and shout to the people
on shore that those in the boat and the ship were friends. This
the interpreter did, and, the natives showing more confidence,
Mr. Chalmers was able to get two chiefs into the boat; and then,
ascertaining that another chief he wanted was away at a village
situated at another part of the bay, the boat was immediately
taken in that direction.</p>
<p>This other village was the one in which the cannibal feast had
just taken place, and there also there were signs of fear that
the <i>Swinger</i> had come to do the natives some harm. But Mr.
Chalmers and Captain Marx landed with the interpreter, and it was
explained to the natives who had come amongst them, and also that
three native boys had been brought back from Queensland, and that
the chiefs were wanted to receive them. The principal chief said
they were glad to have these boys back, but he wanted to know
where the others were who had been taken away, and fifteen or
sixteen names of natives taken by labour vessels were mentioned.
All these had gone away, he said, for three moons, and as they
had not come back, and the three moons had long since expired,
their friends had given them up for dead, and had cooked food for
them and then thrown it away. He was told that he had better come
to the Commodore and let him know all about it; and Mr. Chalmers
stood alongside of the chief, so as to prevent him, if possible,
from getting away until he had consented to come. As at the
first-mentioned village, so it was at the second with regard to
the women and children; and Mr. Chalmers asked the chief and the
natives around him what they meant by sending the women and
children into the bush&mdash;were they going to fight? They hung
their heads, but said they wished it to be peace between the
strangers and themselves. Mr. Chalmers, knowing that there was no
proper security against attack on the part of the natives while
the women and the children were away, at once directed the
interpreter to say there would be no peace until the women and
children were brought back, and then gradually they came
back.</p>
<p>Many of the natives had their cannibal paint upon their faces,
but it was not until the <i>Swinger's</i> boat had returned to
the ship with three chiefs that it became known that there had
been a cannibal feast in the village that morning. Then it was
that the story of the fight and of the subsequent cooking and
eating of the two bodies was recounted by one of the chiefs, and
something of the horrible scene which the boat party had so
narrowly missed witnessing, understood. The <i>Swinger</i>
anchored at the Killerton Islands on the night of Monday,
November 24, but before leaving Milne Bay Captain Marx read the
proclamation concerning the Protectorate, and had it interpreted
to about fifty natives who assembled on board the vessel.</p>
<p>On the Monday night the three cannibal chiefs were brought on
board the <i>Nelson</i>, The principal one&mdash;he who had been
feasting in the morning, and who came to be known on board as
"Cannibal Jack"&mdash;was in all respects, so far as appearances
went, a bad type of native, for his face was cruel and
treacherous. Small, bright black eyes, deep set, looked out from
beneath heavy eyebrows, and a large mouth and rather thick lips
protruded savagely. The lines on his forehead converged at the
nose, so that when he elevated his eyebrows to express anything
of which indifference was a part, he appeared as though he had
been deeply tattooed; and his chin, which was also marked,
receded very much. He was naked with the exception of his girdle,
and his limbs, though not very muscular, were lithe and active.
His hair, which was considerably shorter than that of the Port
Moresby natives and somewhat woolly, was bound by something that
permitted of two greasy-looking ends hanging at the back of his
neck; and in the front of his hair was stuck his comb, which was
made of several long wooden prongs bound together, so that at one
end the prongs spread out like a fan, and at the other were
joined together in a handle. This position for the comb, it was
said, was a sign of peace; but until he was induced to wear the
comb in this fashion, it was stuck behind his ear as a sign of
defiance. On his arms were two broad, black-coloured, grass-made
armlets; in his ears small tortoiseshell and red shell earrings;
and round his neck there was a plaited black cord necklace.</p>
<p>His companions were strikingly different. One of them was even
more savage in appearance, for his features were painted with
something like tar, so that a broad black line passed down the
forehead and the nose to the lip, and then lines of the same kind
from the comers of the mouth and of the eyes. In his case the
hair was worn in a huge mop, with a long comb stuck in the top of
it, the handle of the comb being ornamented at the ends with
black beads and strings; and so low did the hair come down over
his forehead that it hung penthouse fashion over his eyes, giving
him not a little of the aspect of a wild animal. The third man,
strange to say, had more benevolence than anything else about his
features. There certainly was nothing of the bloodthirsty savage
in his appearance, and as he had some very respectable grey
whiskers, and a still more respectable-looking bald head and
portly figure, he would, with a white face instead of a black
one, have made a very presentable Methodist preacher, or, with
his black face, a New Guinea Uncle Tom. He was evidently very
old, for he could not chew his betel-nut; and to prevent himself
from being altogether deprived of it, he had with him in his
basket a small pestle and mortar, with which he pounded the nut
before putting it into his mouth. It was he whom the Commodore
appointed the principal chief of the Milne Bay district.</p>
<p>After the ceremony of reading the proclamation and hoisting
the flag on shore, the Commodore had the three cannibal chiefs
and other chiefs brought into his cabin, and he there had
interpreted by Rev. W. G. Lawes and a native teacher the address
which had been read at the various places visited along the
coast, in order that the natives might clearly understand what
was being done. The chiefs, who were seated on the cabin floor
with their legs bent under them, the three cannibals appearing as
already stated and most of the others attired in coloured shirts
and with a handkerchief or cloth wrapped around their waists,
listened to what was read to them, and signified that they
understood it. They were then asked by the Commodore if they had
any complaints to make to him now that he was there. The chief
with the grey beard and the bald head spoke first, and with
evident earnestness. He said that their children had been taken
away from them (he meant by the labour vessels), and he was very
anxious that they should be returned. "How many?" the Commodore
inquired. The chief extended his hand and began counting on his
fingers, mentioning the names of the natives as he did so
consecutively, and another chief began to do the same, when they
were told that the names had been given to the Commodore by
Captain Marx, and therefore the Commodore was acquainted with
them. "Cannibal Jack" was asked if he had anything to say. His
face immediately wore an extraordinary expression, the movements
of his mouth and his eyebrows causing the wrinkles to dart about
like rays. One man had been taken from his village, but had been
returned the day before by the <i>Swinger</i>. A chief among
those who wore some clothing said a man had been taken from a
village close at hand, and this appearing to be the extent of the
labour vessels' recruiting in that part of New Guinea, the chiefs
generally were questioned as to how long it had been understood
that the natives who had been recruited were to remain away, and
they all said that these natives were to be away for three moons.
Then the Commodore told them that one of the objects of the
Protectorate was to prevent fighting and bloodshed amongst
themselves, and that he was sorry to hear Milne Bay had rather a
bad reputation in this respect. For the future, he said, through
the interpreter, they must not fight amongst themselves, and all
disputes that arose amongst them must be reported to the one
chief at Vaga Vaga (the old man with the grey whiskers), who
would inform the Queen's officers. Then he directed the old chief
to rise from the floor, and, taking him by the hand, he put upon
the chiefs right arm a porcelain armlet as a mark or emblem to
represent the position the chief was appointed to fill. The old
fellow received the decoration with great seriousness, the other
chiefs looking on attentively and in silence; and when they were
all seated again, the subject of cannibalism was mentioned.</p>
<p>Addressing himself to the chief who had been concerned the day
previous in the eating of the two men, the Commodore expressed
his sorrow that on his first visit to that part of New Guinea he
should have heard of a fight between some of the natives, and of
cannibalism. He was there, he said, to express his regret that
cannibalism still existed, and to say that Queen Victoria
expected her children to give up that sort of thing; that
cannibalism was a thing of the past, and therefore he hoped from
that day forth the natives of Milne Bay would give it up. The
cannibal addressed was asked if he understood what the Commodore
intended to convey, and what he had to say in reply. He signified
that he did understand it, but his only reply, at first, was a
raising of his eyebrows and a movement of his lips, half
contemptuous and half submissive. Then he said something which
was interpreted to mean that he would tell his people what the
Commodore had said, and that they must not practise cannibalism
any more. "Tell him and the others," the Commodore then said to
Mr. Lawes, "that I am able to give them a proof of what Queen
Victoria and her officers will do for them, inasmuch as I brought
twenty-six natives from Port Moresby to be returned to their
homes in New Guinea, and a number of these have already been
returned, some of them yesterday. This should be a proof to them
that the Queen's officers have been sent to protect them."</p>
<p>Those of the twenty-six natives from the <i>Elsea</i> still on
board the <i>Nelson</i>, namely, six of the escapees, had been
brought into the cabin before the interview with the chiefs
commenced; and, pointing to them, the Commodore had it explained
to the chiefs that these six escapees belonged to islands to
which the Commodore could not go, and therefore he intended to
leave them with the teacher at the mission station ashore, who
would see that they were taken to their homes, and he hoped the
chiefs would do all they could to assist these natives in getting
to their homes. "Tell these chiefs," he continued, "that I have
myself brought these natives here as a sign to all the native
tribes of friendship and protection." Most of the chiefs
intimated that they understood this, but the two cannibals with
the savage features were silent and gloomy. Presents were then
distributed, each of the chiefs passing by the large pier-glass
in the cabin as he left the room with what had been given him,
and manifesting much astonishment at discovering himself in the
glass; and "Cannibal Jack" receiving an additional reminder from
the Commodore at parting, that for the future he was to eat no
more men.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><span class="uu">Teste
Island&mdash;Remarkable Upheavals from the Sea&mdash;The Last
Ceremony on Shore&mdash;The Commodore's Concluding
Address&mdash;Homeward bound.</span></p>
<p><span class="aa">The</span> last place visited by H.M.S.
<i>Nelson</i>, and the last place of departure, was Teste Island,
which was left at two o'clock in the afternoon of Wednesday,
November 26. The <i>Nelson</i> arrived there, with the
<i>Espiegle</i>, the <i>Raven</i>, and the <i>Dart</i>, the
previous evening, from the Killerton Islands, by way of Dinner
Island, where the <i>Raven</i> was waiting for the flagship with
mails from Cooktown.</p>
<p>Teste Island lies some distance from New Guinea, so far, in
fact, that the New Guinea coast disappears from view long before
Teste Island is reached. But there is other land in sight. The
weather was squally when the <i>Nelson</i> was there, with heavy
showers of rain&mdash;a very common thing in this region, it is
said&mdash;and it was therefore only dimly that the outline of
the Basilaki, or Moresby Island, the scene of the
<i>Espiegle's</i> interesting visit, was apparent to the eye. But
nearer, and close to Teste Island, there were some remarkable
upheavals from the sea, or the remnants of some sunken land, in
the form of rocky eminences towering high in the air, the great
cliffs being ornamented with a crest of vegetation extensive
enough only to provide a home for seabirds. One of these solitary
rocks is called the Bell Rock, because its shape is very much the
same as that of a bell; but the name is not inappropriate for
another reason, as when the weather is boisterous and the waves
are high the breakers must dash against the cliffs (which in
places have been hollowed out into caves) with a booming sound
that should be, above the noise of the storm, a warning to the
mariner as distinct as the sight of the white broken water. Teste
Island itself is a few miles of land in the form of hills rising,
as emeralds do from their setting, above a circlet of tropical
vegetation, in which the cocoanut palms show conspicuously, and
guarded, as it were, by a fringe of coral, upon which the sea
breaks some distance from the beach.</p>
<p>The men-of-war anchored on the north side of the island, where
only the vegetation bordering the beach, and the hills with signs
of cultivation on their slopes, could be seen. On the south side
there is a mission station, as well as a native village,
containing, perhaps, five hundred natives. But circumstances did
not permit of the <i>Nelson's</i> anchoring at the south side of
the island, and it was therefore decided that the proclamation of
the Protectorate should be read and the flag hoisted near the
beach on the north side. Accordingly a spar was towed on shore
early on the morning of the 26th of November, and set up as a
flagstaff; and between eight and nine o'clock a detachment of
blue-jackets and marines and a large number of officers landed to
take part in the ceremony of reading the proclamation and
hoisting the flag. There were not observed in this, the
concluding, ceremony of the series arranged by the Commodore, all
the details which were associated with the proceedings at Port
Moresby and at two or three other places, where all the
<i>clat</i> possible was given to what transpired; but there was
something very picturesque and fitting about it The cocoanut and
mammy-apple palms clustered in a grove about the flagstaff, and,
with the ordinary forest vegetation, formed a very pretty
surrounding to the company of blue-jackets and marines drawn up
in hollow square, with their colours&mdash;a white ensign and a
union jack&mdash;to the front, and to the party of officers with
Commodore Erskine at their head, and the gathering of astonished
natives close by. And the manner in which the strains of the
National Anthem rang out as a royal salute greeted the hoisting
of the flag, and in which the sound of the guns of the
<i>Nelson</i> reverberated among the hills, while all else was
silent, and every man present stood bareheaded, gave an
impressiveness to the ceremony which was very appropriate, and
the effect of which was heightened by a few well-timed remarks
with which the Commodore brought the proceedings and his visit to
New Guinea to a termination.</p>
<p>Addressing those present the Commodore said: "Captain Bridge,
Commander Henderson, officers, and men,&mdash;This being the last
occasion on which the ceremony of proclaiming the British
Protectorate in New Guinea will be performed, and having now
hoisted the flag at nine different places, I may be permitted to
say a few words of congratulation at having concluded the task
allotted to us. Personally I shall always remember with the
greatest satisfaction and pleasure my having had the good fortune
to be connected with such an important work, especially as I
shall be able to look back upon it as the last act of my
interesting command on this station, when I was surrounded and
assisted by the officers and men with whom I have been associated
for the last three years. I ask you, in conclusion, to join with
me in the fervent hope that the establishment of this
Protectorate may conduce to the happiness, the peace, and the
welfare of these people; that it maybe a security to the
Australian Colonies, and to the best interests of their people;
and that it may redound to the honour of her Most Gracious
Majesty Queen Victoria, for whom I ask you now to give three
hearty cheers." The cheers were given heartily, and the ceremony
concluded.</p>
<p>Preparations for departure were made immediately everybody had
returned on board the vessels from the shore. H.M.S. <i>Dart</i>
sailed at once for Cooktown with telegraphic despatches, and
H.M.S. <i>Espiegle</i> shortly afterwards for Port Moresby with
despatches for Deputy-Commissioner Romilly, informing him that
the Commodore had sailed from New Guinea, and therefore leaving
him free to carry out his duties as Deputy Commissioner. H.M.S.
<i>Raven</i> received orders to convey Mr. Chalmers back to South
Cape, and, with H.M.S. <i>Swinger</i>, was for a few months to
remain cruising on the New Guinea coast. Mr. Chalmers left the
<i>Nelson</i> for the <i>Raven</i> shortly before the flagship
took her departure, and he carried with him the good wishes of
all on board. Just before leaving, the Commodore, with some
kindly remarks and thanks for the services he had rendered,
presented to him a stick of office like those which had been
given to the principal native chiefs. It was the only stick
remaining out of six, and in Mr. Chalmers's possession it is an
interesting <i>souvenir</i> of a period which will always be
remembered, and in which he played a prominent part. Very soon
after Mr. Chalmers had joined the <i>Raven</i> the anchors of the
<i>Nelson</i> were weighed, and with the band on the quarter-deck
playing "Homeward Bound," Teste Island and its hills and
cocoanuts were soon far behind, and the flagship was speeding on
her way to Sydney.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><span class="uu">General
Observations&mdash;The People of New Guinea and their
Productions&mdash;Opportunities for White Settlement&mdash;No
Signs of Gold&mdash;The Climate&mdash;Fever&mdash;Hostility of
Natives&mdash;Missionary Experiences, and Results of Missionary
Labours.</span></p>
<p><span class="aa">Now</span> that the account of the visit of
H.M.S. <i>Nelson</i> and the men-of-war accompanying her to New
Guinea has been brought to a close, it maybe well to offer a few
general observations respecting the country, its people, and
their productions, and the opportunities that present themselves
for the settlement of a white population; and to say something of
the missionary labours on the island.</p>
<p>Settlement is for the present prohibited, but when it shall be
permitted it will not be easy for the settlers to make their
positions in the country immediately profitable. The soil in many
places&mdash;probably in most&mdash;is undoubtedly good, and the
vegetable productions which are the result of the labours of the
natives, show that it can be brought to a high state of
cultivation. But some time must elapse before it can be
accurately determined what the soil in particular localities will
produce most readily and in the highest perfection. It was
noticed, during the run of the squadron along the southern coast,
that the vegetables grown by the natives were not found in all
the places visited, and in some localities they were much larger
and finer than they were in others. It was the same with fruit;
and sugar-cane we saw in only two or three places.</p>
<p>We found, as is usually the case, that cultivation was carried
on best where the natural vegetation was densest and most
luxuriant, and that was in localities a considerable distance
eastward of Port Moresby. There the rainfall is said to be more
constant and copious than it is westward, and the soil is richer,
producing yams, taro, and sweet potatoes, and bananas, mammy
apples, and other fruits, in abundance. Sugar-cane was most
commonly seen in the possession of the natives in the eastern
part of the island, but this article of production does not
appear to be cultivated extensively, though it is said to grow
well in various parts of the country. Cocoanuts appear to be
abundant along the whole length of the coast, but in all
probability they are not more than sufficient for the native
population, which is very numerous and little or nothing could be
done with them in the way of export trade. The sago palm also
forms part of the native food production, and westward of Port
Moresby seems to be plentiful.</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether we saw any ebony. This wood is known to
be procurable in New Guinea, and it was said, when the squadron
was on its way to Kerepunu, that we should find plenty of it in
that direction in the form of greenstone axe-handles, and, it
might be, spears. But I saw none, and though it was reported that
one or two specimens of the woods were obtained, it is probable
that in these cases the wood was of an ordinary description
blackened by fire or some dark colouring matter. Timber of
various valuable kinds is to be found on the rivers and in their
neighbourhood, and if what is said with regard to it be true, a
very profitable timber trade might be carried on.</p>
<p>Gold, too, probably exists in the mountains and in their
vicinity, though it is a remarkable fact that no sign of it is to
be seen among the coast natives, and they would have nothing to
do with any ornaments having the appearance of gold which were
offered to them by persons on board the men-of-war in the way of
trade. Polished and shining brass bracelets of a very pretty
pattern, and neck pendants of the same material, only excited
ridicule when they were offered to male natives in exchange for
something they had to sell, and it was very plain that nothing
like gold was either familiar or attractive to them. Grazing
operations might be carried on, so far as they relate to cattle.
Grass and water are in many places abundant, and cattle, it is
believed, would thrive very well; but the industry, it is
considered, would be confronted by a serious drawback, for it is
difficult to say where a profitable market would be found for the
cattle. As for sheep, it is thought the climate is altogether
against them, and that they would lose their wool, as they do in
Fiji.</p>
<p>What, therefore, there is at present to which white settlers
could devote their attention with any likelihood of a profit
sufficiently large to compensate them for the inconveniences they
would have to put up with, it is difficult to say. The only
prospect worth mentioning is that the island may, by the
cultivation of certain products, be made another Java, with
English or Australian capital and energy to establish and
maintain a large export trade in sugar, coffee, tobacco, and
other such articles.</p>
<p>The cultivation of these products, according to the system
adopted in Java, would necessitate the employment of natives; for
though white men, with due precautions, may be able to work in
plantations under the New Guinea sun, it is doubtful whether
these precautions would be taken, and without them it would be
impossible to labour for any length of time and with anything
like regularity in the open air. Then if native labour were
necessary, it is probable that it would have to be imported, for
the New Guineans are not a hard-working people, and what work
they do in the fields in the way of cultivation is so much
confined to their own wants that it is considered by those who
know them to be hardly likely that they could be induced to toil
for a certain number of hours each day for the benefit of
others.</p>
<p>The heat along the southern coast is not only intense, but it
is of that objectionable description known as "muggy." While the
excessive temperature is very trying, and the glare of the sun
burns one's features almost to the colour of the skin of a
native, the great humidity of the atmosphere IS exceedingly
oppressive, and one's clothes become sticky with
perspiration.</p>
<p>Fever is said to be very prevalent; but we saw it in only one
place, and in some localities where it was said to exist, the
appearance of the country seemed to cast discredit on the
statement. But in the healthiest spot fever may be contracted
under certain conditions, and they are little more than a neglect
of common sanitary precautions against the disease. For instance,
in the interior where the land is more mountainous than at some
parts of the actual coastline, rain falls frequently, and a
traveller who is overtaken by a shower and gets wet, is certain
to be attacked by fever if he camp in his wet clothes. To this
single circumstance, of either neglecting or being unable to
change one's clothes after getting wet, are ascribed many of the
cases of fever which have attacked members of the parties who
have at different times landed in New Guinea, with the object of
exploring the country. But though fever has been a great obstacle
to exploration hitherto, it may to a large extent be kept at a
distance.</p>
<p>The probable hostility of the natives is a greater difficulty
in the way of persons who may be desirous of attempting to open
up the country Where exploring parties have been travelling their
relations with the natives have in some instances been very
unfriendly, and the effect of this on the native mind is lasting;
and where explorers have not yet made their appearance, the
natives may show signs of an intention to oppose by force any
invasion of their territory. Every foot of land, and every
cocoanut tree in the country are said to have owners, and not
only are all the natives jealous of their rights, but they are,
as a people, naturally evil-disposed and treacherous and
cruel.</p>
<p>The experiences of the missionaries in this respect are well
worthy of notice. Ten years ago, when the Rev. W. G. Lawes and
Mrs. Lawes landed at Port Moresby, they found the natives there
to be inveterate thieves. Even the oven had to be watched. There
was no possibility of keeping anything without constantly
watching it, and in spite of the watching, it seemed to go away.
The worst feature about the matter was that the natives felt no
shame. One man was appealed to by Mr. Lawes, who asked him
whether, after the kindness that had been shown to him, he was
not ashamed at what he had done, by stealing from his benefactor;
and the answer was, "Oh no, I am not ashamed."</p>
<p>As I have mentioned in a previous article, the natives
ardently covet the tattoo marks, which show that they have killed
some one; but their manner of fighting is the manner of the
assassin and the murderer. They are so superstitious that no
native believes any one dies from disease. If a death occur in a
village it is believed to have been caused by evil spirits, and
because one of the medicine men of a tribe tells the natives that
the death has been brought about by a spirit from some other
tribe, it must be revenged. From this it may be understood what a
feeling of animosity is always aflame between one tribe of
natives and another; and there is no reason why similar
superstitions should not possess the minds of the natives with
regard to the members of any party of white men who may attempt
to open up the country or form settlements.</p>
<p>But Mr. Lawes has found some good traits among the people. "I
know some good and noble traits," he said, in the address he
delivered to the officers and crew of the <i>Nelson</i>, to which
in a previous part of this book I made some reference, "but these
stand out in bold relief as exceptions, like some
solitary-looking flowers in a desert, just indicating what the
soil might produce if it were cultivated."</p>
<p>"We landed at Port Moresby," he said on the same occasion,
"without knowing a word of the native language, and the natives
knew nothing about us. But" (and here his remarks are of
importance to any one who contemplates visiting New Guinea)
"there is one language that is understood all the world over, and
it is the language of human kindness. We had to go to New Guinea
with that, and find our way by that That way may be down the
native tobacco pipe, or in relation to other small and trivial
things, but we had to establish ourselves first of all as the
friends of the natives, so as to show them that our intentions
were kindly and for their good."</p>
<p>Referring to the missionary efforts in the island, he
emphatically said, "We must not try to introduce into New Guinea
English Christianity. There is a great diversity between the
dress of New Guineans and that of Englishmen, and to attempt to
introduce to the natives a Christianity in an English dress would
be a mistake. There is," he proceeded, "a wonderful adaptability
in the gospel, and it is suited to all conditions of men. But
that which may be the best channel for introducing the gospel to
those used to English customs and dress may not be that which is
best adapted to those who have been living without these customs
and dress, and under very different circumstances. It would be a
mistake to introduce among such a people any particular creed or
formality, or to do otherwise than to put before them the gospel
in its simplest form."</p>
<p>And how successful the work of the missionaries has been can
also be told in Mr. Lawes' own words. "For instance," he said,
"at Port Moresby, when we first went there, we never met a man
who would not steal or tell a lie when he thought fit to do so;
but the circumstances of our living among them, and neither
stealing nor departing from the truth, told on them. We did not
refrain from teaching and preaching, but in those early days, and
when the first attempts at preaching were made, a man would
sometimes shout in the midst of what I was saying, "That's a
lie." The kind of audience we used to have was sufficient to
surprise any one; but we found that there was nothing in the
gospel of Christianity that could not be received into the native
heart. We find no difficulty in explaining to them the truth, and
I do not know that they have any difficulty in accepting it. I do
not say that they understand all the Word of God, but the great
central truths of Christianity, the great facts of the life of
Christ and His atonement, are readily grasped by them."</p>
<p>Speaking of the native teachers, he pointed out how valuable
were the labours of these South Sea Islanders, who were the
coadjutors and colleagues of the missionaries, and he
characterized the teacher at Port Moresby as one of the finest
men in New Guinea. At the time when some diggers searching for
gold were struck down with fever, this teacher went more than
once several miles inland to carry the sick to Port Moresby and
to tend them. Yet his father was a cannibal, and he is only one
generation from cannibalism. At the east end of New Guinea, where
cannibalism still flourishes, the teacher is a Loyalty Islander,
and has himself been a cannibal. "In these cases," Mr. Lawes
considers, "we have the best evidence of what the gospel will
do." The perils to which these teachers are exposed are very
great The murder of a number of them at Kalo occurred so recently
that it is still fresh in the recollection of all who have paid
any attention to matters in New Guinea, and a story that was told
me of the marvellous escape of a teacher's wife from a horrible
death in the jaws of an alligator, shows that the lives of these
people are frequently in danger from causes other than the
murderous weapons of the New Guinea natives.</p>
<p>In this incident of the escape from the alligator, the
teacher's wife was on the beach at Kerepunu at a time when it was
difficult in the dim evening light to distinguish objects with
certainty, and she found herself suddenly attacked by an enormous
alligator. The alligators of New Guinea are said to be dangerous
only when anything gets between them and the water, and this poor
woman found herself close to this enormous brute, as, startled by
something, it was coming rapidly towards the water. She tried to
escape out of its way, but did not succeed, and the reptile,
seizing her by the dress, dragged her into the water, where she
would certainly have been dreadfully mangled and drowned had not
her screams providentially attracted the attention of her
husband, who happened to be not far off. He rushed into the water
after her, and by shouts and blows with a stick managed to
frighten the alligator and to rescue his wife, though not before
she was torn very much by the creature's claws.</p>
<p>The mission stations in connection with the eastern branch of
the New Guinea mission now number thirty-six, and wherever the
mission influence extends white men may with safety go among the
natives; but even around the mission stations the natives retain
some of their wild nature, and though they have learned to regard
the white man as a friend, they will resent, and it may be with
deadly effect, any insult or injury done to them.</p>
<p>The missionaries point out to those who look for the results
from the mission that in a place like New Guinea we must not be
impatient of results. "We are thankful," Mr. Lawes said on the
<i>Nelson</i>, "for the indication of change. At Port Moresby, if
the people are not strictly honest, they are now ashamed of
thieving. They were at one time the marauders and pirates of the
coast. When canoes came there to trade, a chief&mdash;one of
those who came on board the <i>Nelson</i>&mdash;would say to the
Port Moresby natives, "Now, boys, there's a canoe coming," and
they would immediately go on board and help themselves to
everything, and tell those in the canoe they might be thankful
that their lives were spared. But for ten years past a spear has
never been uplifted at Port Moresby in anger, and the influence
proceeding from this fact along the coast is very great. Even at
a raid the other day at Kapa Kapa no woman was touched, and this
is an indication of a change in the moral feeling of the people.
There are some New Guinea communicants about whose Christian
faith I have no more doubt than I have of that of my own friends.
Cannibalism has been shamed out of existence in some districts,
and in others it has probably received its death blow; we have
the confidence of the people all along the south-east coast."</p>
