<h3>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h3>
<p><span class="a">This</span> little History, in eight chapters,
only touches a few of the more prominent incidents connected with
pastoral settlement and the gold discovery in the Ballarat
district. The compiler has seen the growth of the town from a
mere collection of canvas tents among the trees and on the grassy
slopes and flats of the wild bush to its present condition. Less
than 20 years ago there was not a house where now stands this
wealthy mine and farm-girdled city, whose population is nearly
equal to the united populations of Oxford and Cambridge, and
exceeding by several thousands the united populations of the
cities of Winchester, Canterbury, Salisbury, and Lichfield at the
time of the gold discovery. This is one of the truths which are
magnificently stranger than fiction.</p>
<p>Some of the first workers in this mighty creation are still
here. Of the pastoral pioneers there are still with us the
Messrs. Learmonth, Pettett, Waldie, Winter, Fisken, Coghill, and
Bacchus; and the Rev. Thomas Hastie is still living at the Manse
at Buninyong.</p>
<p>Down the valley of the Leigh, where the Sebastopol streets and
fences run over the eastern escarpment of the table land, may
still be seen the sandstone foundations of a station begun by the
Messrs. Yuille, whom the coming of the first hosts of
gold-hunters scared away from a place no longer fit, in their
opinion, for pastoral occupation. Those unfinished walls are in a
paddock overlooking a little carse of some four or five acres by
the creek side, owned by an Italian farmer, and close to the
junction of the Woolshed Creek with the main stream in the
valley. On the other side of the larger stream rise basaltic
mounds, marked with the pits and banks of the earlier miners.
Like the trenches of an old battle-field, these works of the
digging armies of the past are now grass-grown and spotted with
wild flowers. All around, the open lands of fifteen years ago are
turned into streets and fields and gardens. A little way lower
down the valley, where the ground has a broad slope up from the
left bank of the Leigh to the foot of the ranges, was the Magpie
rush of 1855-6. For a mile nearly every inch of frontage was
fought for then, and a town of over four thousand inhabitants
sprang up. Gold was found plentifully, and warehouse, hotel, and
saloon crowded close with dwelling and church along the
thoroughfare. A summer flood surprised the dwellers on the
lowland and carried off lives as well as property, mingling a
tragic sorrow with the losses of the unsuccessful. Time, less
sudden than the midsummer freshet, but more sweeping, has cleared
the ground of almost every vestige of the busy but fragile life
of fifteen years ago. But the eternal sense of the Infinite
survives "our little lives" and all their fitful pulsations of
varying passion. Yonder, where, by the bush track side, the
rounding slope swells upon the south, stands a church, sombre,
lonely, and silent as the Roman sentinel at Pompeii when all
around him had fled or fallen. This is all, save here and there
heaps of broken bottles and sardine tins half hidden by the
grass, and a few faint trench and building lines, softened by the
rains, and bright at this time with the young verdure of the
turning season. The most curious eye could now discover no other
traces of the rush if it were not for the broader and deeper
marks left where the first miners fought their industrial way,
and where, for years, their followers retraced the golden trail.
On going up the Yarrowee banks northward a space, as one looks up
the valley he sees, beyond the city, the bare top, the white
artificial chasms and banks and mounds, where Black Hill raised
its dark dense head of forest trees before the digger rent the
hill in twain, and half disembowelled the swelling headland.</p>
<p>Besides the pastoral settlers already mentioned, there are yet
with us some of the first discoverers. Esmond is still here.
Woodward and Turner, of the Golden Point discoverers, are still
here in Ballarat, and Merrick and some others of that band remain
in the district. Others who followed them within the first week
or two are also amongst our busy townsfolk of to-day.</p>
<p>While these remained it was thought desirable to gather some
of the honey of fact from fugitive opportunity, that it might be
garnered for the historian of the future. Nearly all the persons
whose names have been mentioned above have assisted in the
preparation of this narrative by furnishing valuable
contributions from their own recollections, and the compiler
takes this occasion to thank them and others, including legal
managers of mines, whose ready courtesy has enabled him to do
what he has done to rescue from forgetfulness the brief details
here chronicled touching the history of this gold-field. He has
borrowed some facts and figures, too, from Mr. Harrie Wood's ably
compiled notes, published in Mr. Brough Smyth's "Gold-fields and
Mineral Districts of Victoria." To the officers of most of the
public institutions referred to he also owes the acknowledgment
of much courtesy; and to Mr. Huyghue, a gentleman still holding
office in Ballarat, and who was in the public service here at the
time of the Eureka Stockade, thanks are due, both by the
publisher and compiler, for notes of that period, and for the
extremely interesting illustrations of the Stockade, the Camp,
and other spots copied from original drawings. The publisher also
acknowledges the courtesy of Mr. Ferres, the Government printer,
in supplying original documents, and of Mr. Noone in giving
valuable assistance in connection with their reproduction by the
photo-lithographic process. The contributions of newspaper
correspondents during the Eureka Stockade troubles have also
assisted the compiler, and notably the letters of the
correspondent of the <i>Geelong Advertiser</i> in 1854-5. But to
Mr. John Noble Wilson, the commercial manager of the <i>Ballarat
Star</i>, is due, on the part of all concerned, the recognition
of his suggesting the narrative, of his constant cordial
co-operation, and his untiring ingenuity in making suggestions
and collecting materials both for the text and the illustrations.
The reproduced proclamations by the Government, which the reader
will find at intervals, as well as many of the original
documents, are the fruit of that gentleman's assiduity in
collecting materials of interest and pertinence.</p>
<p>It has been necessary to record the fact that the tragic issue
of the license agitation was mainly due to the mistakes of the
governing authorities, even as the unrighteous rigors of the
digger-hunting processes were made more poignant by the haughty
indiscretions and brutal excesses of commissioners and troopers.
But it is equally incumbent on the recorder to recognise the more
agreeable fact that there were officers in both grades who did
their harsh duties differently. Some of these are still in the
service, and retain the respect they won in the more troublous
times by their judicious and humane administration of an
obnoxious law, for the existence of which they were in no way
responsible.</p>
<p>In the matter of gold statistics there has been found great
difficulty, for the early records were imperfect, and the latter
ones are little, if in anywise, superior; while searches for the
first newspaper accounts of the gold discovery have shown that,
both in Melbourne and Geelong, the public files have been rifled
of invaluable portions by the miserable meanness of some unknown
thieves.</p>
<p>The future we have not essayed to divine. What the past and
the present of our local history may do to enable the reader to
speculate upon the future, each one must for himself determine,
though the faith of the Ballarat of to-day in the Ballarat of the
future may, we think, be more accurately inferred from the stable
monuments of civic enterprise, and the many signs of mining,
manufacturing, and rural industry around, than from the
occasional forebodings of fear in seasons of depression. In less
than two decades we have created a large city, built up great
fortunes, laid the foundations of many commercial successes, and
sown the seeds of yet undeveloped industries; and those who have
seen so much should not readily think that we are near the
exhaustion of our resources, either in the precious minerals, or
the still more precious spirit of enterprise and industry
necessary for the development of the wealth of nature around us.
For the good done, and for the doers of the good, we may all be
thankful, if not proud; and, in proportion as we are thus moved,
we may look with confident hope towards the future, whose
uncertain years are lit up with the radiance of the past, and
shaped to our vision by the promise of the present.</p>
<p>Among modest writers it is the fashion not only to write
prefaces, but to excite attention to wonderful merit by apologies
for defects. The present writer burns to be in the fashion. He
craves the indulgence of the reader in informing that important
personage that the ordinary duties of a reporter on a daily
morning paper are not luxuriously light, and that the compilation
of the following narrative has been a refreshing appendage to the
daily discharge of such ordinary duties, plus a bracing exercise
of sub-editorial function. He has, no doubt, amply vindicated
Bolingbroke's accurate apothegm, and especially in this preface.
Both preface and narrative may be regarded as a verbose
exaggeration of the importance of the subject. The answer to that
is, that the writer has written mainly for those who know the
place, and, knowing it, are proud of it; for those who believe in
the future in reserve for it, for the colony to which it belongs
to-day, and for the empire of which it some day may be a not
altogether unimportant portion.</p>
<p>In the City of York, where memory and fancy, busy with the
records and the remains of the past, make of the softened lights
and shadows and many-colored figures of mediaeval English history
an inexpressible charm, the glorious Minster rises over all
supreme in its solemn and saintly beauty. Whatever pilgrim there
has studiously perused that marvellous "poem in stone" may have
seen over one of the doorways the work of some loving and pious
egotist in the following inscription:&mdash;"Ut rosa flos florum,
sic tu es domus domorum." <a name="FNanchor_01" id=
"FNanchor_01"></a><a href="#fn01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Let us
be permitted, with similar egotism, if not with equal piety, to
inscribe here, as over one of the portals of approach to one of
the golden fields and cities of Victoria:&mdash;Ut aurum
metallorum pretiosissimum, sic tu es camporum aureorum princeps,
urbiumque opulentissima. <a name="FNanchor_02" id=

<h3>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h3>
<p><span class="a">This</span> second edition was called for as
the first was out of print, and this new issue and all the
author's interest in the History are the sole property of the
publishers. In transferring my rights to the publishers, I
undertook to write what was deemed necessary to bring the
narrative "up to date". To do this and supply some omissions from
the first edition were, both, desirable, and the attempt has been
carried out as far as the publishers' views as to space have
permitted. How inadequate the realisation is, my repeated wails
in the text admit as frankly as possible. Independently of the
omissions from the first edition, the developments of the city
and suburbs during the 17 years since 1870 involved so much
matter that it was found impossible to deal with it all in a
satisfactory manner within the space available; but it is hoped
that the leading events of the period have, at least, been in
some way recognised. And even that could not have been done had
it not been that the author, with some few exceptions, met
everywhere the readiest will to assist him by supplying the
official information required. In the body of the work these
courtesies have been generally acknowledged, and I desire to
repeat here my sense of indebtedness in that respect to very many
citizens. It is not for me to judge how ill or well my part of
the work has been done, but it may be permitted to me to say that
the publishers and printers have finished their work in a manner
that does credit to them and to the arts they represent. Mr.
Niven has enriched the edition with many illustrations from his
own pencil, and the photo-lithographs of official and other
documents which give <i>fac similes</i> of those papers, bespeak
the resources of the publishers' establishment. The apposite;
designs on the cover, and their engraving and printing, are all
the product of the publishers' own office, and compare creditably
with the work of old-world firms. The map of the mines, at page
232,* has been prepared from surveys specially made by Mr. Robert
Allan, mining surveyor, and is a document of interest and value.
To Mr. Anderson, the head printer, I owe my thanks for many
intelligent suggestions in the course of the revisal of proofs,
and his vigilant eye detected some errors in Appendix A which had
lain unnoticed ever since the issue of the edition of 1870. It is
hoped that the present edition is nearly free from literal
errors, but two or three have been noticed since the matter
passed through the press. In the bottom line, page 61, the date
1855 should be 1854; in the heading to Chapter VI.
"representative charges" should be "representative changes;" and
in the bottom line, page 285, the date 1857 should be 1856.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* The original map was not available; another,
also produced by Niven, has been substituted here&mdash;N.O.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** All these corrections have been
made&mdash;N.O.]</p>
<p>A word to scholars, that they may not believe a lie. I am no
Latinist. As a poor pavior on the high road of letters, I picked
up some Roman <i>tesseræ</i> <a name="FNanchor_03" id=
"FNanchor_03"></a><a href="#fn03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> by the
way side, and, to please my fancy and give bits of color and tone
of reminiscence and meaning not else handy, inserted them here
and there in the ruder work. Only that, my learned brothers of
the great republic.</p>
<p>The writer of even so small a history as this, is but as the
voice of one crying in a wilderness of facts and dates, in hope
of reducing them in some sort to cosmic order. Like the life it
essays to depict, history is only a drama, and the historian
merely sets the scenes, and lifts the curtain, where else had
been uncertainty or oblivion.</p>
<p>Our revels now are ended. The actors here, too, were all
spirits. Many, as squatters Pettett, Waldie, Winter Bacchus, one
of the Learmonth's, besides a host of mining and civic pioneers,
have melted into air since the first edition was issued. The
veteran Thomas Hastie still lives at the Buninyong manse, and
others still grace, or disgrace, with their corporal presence,
the scenes of their exploits. There remain Humffray and Lalor,
and, with other of Lalor's Stockade subalterns, the gold-finder
Esmond. Humffray and Esmond are in the shallows, but Lalor, on
whose "rebel" head a price was once set, floats proudly as the
able and well-salaried Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. His
political friends are not ashamed to plead for a retiring pension
for him, after he has, for many years, been liberally paid for
his services in a nominally pension-hating democracy; whilst
Esmond, but for whose discovery Lalor might never have been here,
has failed to get leave to earn State wages enough to keep the
wolf from the door.</p>
<p>The fingers of change move swiftly. Whilst facts and figures
have been shaping for the printers of this edition, the funerals
of some of those who furnished the matter have passed by. Since
the last chapter has been in type, the old mess-room of the civil
and military officers of the Camp has been sold, and its
materials have been removed piece-meal. Thirty years ago, the
present Premier of Victoria stood in his blue serge shirt on the
verandah of the house, and unsuccessfully tried to persuade his
brother blue-shirts to return him, at that time, to the court
then sitting there. "Rebel" bullets fell about the house during
the ante-Stockade trouble, and then the vanquished victors of the
Stockade sent representatives to sit in the mess-room as a Local
Court, with Warden Sherard as first chairman, and thereafter, as
long as the court lived, with the merry, brown-eyed Daly, and
with the merrier and caustic Miskelly as the clerk for awhile.
Ex-Chairman Sherard is still here, as Savings Bank actuary, but
Daly and many others, who sat there a generation agone, are dead.
The old historic house itself is now gone, too, and a free public
library is to be built upon the site.</p>
<p>For myself, I now vanish for ever from this stage, to write
editions of this History no more&mdash;if this be history. But
though I now retire behind the scenes, so far as this work is
concerned, I shall not forget the play nor the leading players.
The largest portion of my life has been spent here, and if there
be any possibility of the realisation of such a sad conceit as
that of the Tudor Mary, who said Calais would be found written
upon her heart, the name of this beautiful city of Ballarat may
be found written upon mine.</p>

<div class="dropcap"><img alt="" src=

<br>
<div>A L L A R A T is one of the wonders of this century. Young
in years its mutations have been many and rapid, and its
marvellous progress has given to it a seeming antiquity beyond
its urban years. Our task is to trace an outline of the rise and
progress of this golden city. This task takes us back to days
that seem, in the swift march of colonial events, to belong
already to a remote antiquity. While the sailor-King William IV.
was but newly buried, and Queen Victoria was still an uncrowned
maiden; while only a few rude huts, sprinkled about the still
uncleared slopes and gullies, failed to scare away the native
animals that haunted the bush where the City of Melbourne now
stands; while the pleasant borders of the Bay of Corio, where
Geelong is to-day, were not graced by a single house, but only
bore on their silent slopes a few scattered tents, a small band
of settlers started from the Corio shore to explore the unknown
country to the north-west. This was in the month of August, 1837.
The party comprised Mr. Thomas Livingstone Learmonth; Mr. D'Arcy,
a surveyor; Dr. Thompson, late of Geelong; Mr. David Fisher, then
manager of the Derwent Company, Tasmania; Captain Hutton, of the
East India Company's Service; and Mr. Henry Anderson. With them
they took suitable equipment and provisions. From Bellpost Hill
they saw in the distance, north-westward, a mount, to which they
directed their course, steering their way by compass, and thus
they arrived at and ascended Mount Buninyong. From the Mount the
explorers saw fine country to the north-westward, Lake
Burrumbeet, and the distant ranges of the Pyrenees and the
Grampians. An ocean of forest, with island hills, was all around
them, but not a speck visible that spoke to them of civilisation.
But the promising landscape drew the explorers on westward and
north-westward. They descended the Mount, the party divided,
their compass-bearings were not well kept, the provision-cart
failed to be at the appointed rendezvous, and thus, broken into
sections, the explorers found their way back to the coast, some
of them unable to find their provisions, and therefore fasting by
the way.</div>
<br>
<p>In January of the next year explorers set out again. The party
this time consisted of Messrs. J. Aitken, Henry Anderson, Thomas
L. Learmonth, Somerville L. Learmonth, and William Yuille. The
starting point was Mr. Aitken's house, at Mount Aitken, and
thence the explorers went towards Mount Alexander, which at that
time had just been occupied by a party of overlanders from
Sydney, consisting of Messrs. C.H. Ebden, Yaldwin, and Mollison.
From Mount Alexander they followed the course of the Loddon,
passed over what has since been proved to be a rich auriferous
country, and bore down on a prominent peak, which the explorers
subsequently called Ercildoun, from the old keep on the Scottish
border, with which the name of the Learmonth's ancestor, Thomas
the Rhymer, was associated. Their course brought them to the lake
district of Burrumbeet and its rich natural pastures. The days
were hot but the nights cold, and the party, camping at night on
an eminence near Ercildoun, suffered so much from cold that they
gave the camping place the name Mount Misery. There was water
then in Burrumbeet, but it was intensely salt and very shallow.
Next year, 1839, Lake Burrumbeet was quite dry, and it remained
dry for several succeeding summers. It was covered with rank
vegetation, and the ground afforded excellent pasture after the
ranker growth had been burnt off. The country thus discovered was
occupied during the year 1838, and other settlers, pushing on in
the same direction, in a couple of years completed the occupation
of all the fine pastoral country as far westward as the Hopkins
River. The brothers Learmonth, Mr. Henry Anderson, Messrs.
Archibald and W.C. Yuille, and Mr. Waldie settled on the
subsequently revealed gold-fields of Ballarat, Buninyong,
Sebastopol, and their immediate vicinities. Some members of the
Clyde Company, of Tasmania, visited the Western district in 1838,
that company giving the name to the Clyde Inn, of the old Geelong
coach road. They settled upon the Moorabool and the Leigh, Mr.
George Russell being the manager. Major Mercer, who gave the name
to Mount Mercer, and Mr. D. Fisher, were of that company. The
Narmbool run, near Meredith, was taken by Mr. Neville in 1839.
Ross' Creek was named from Capt. Ross, who in those early days
used to perform the feat of walking in Highland costume all the
way to Melbourne. But in those times travelling was a more
serious matter than in these days of railroads, coaches, cabs,
and other vehicles, with good roads and a generally settled
country. Then there were no roads, few people, and a thick
forest, encumbered about Ballarat, too, with the native hop. Mr.
Archibald Fisken, of Lal Lal, was the first person to drive a
vehicle through the then roadless forest of Warrenheip and
Bullarook. In 1846 he drove a dog-cart tandem with Mr. W. Taylor
through the bush to Longerenong, on the Wimmera.</p>
<p>Messrs. T.L. and S.L. Learmonth, whose father was then in
Hobarton, settled their homestead on what became known as the
Buninyong Gold Mining Company's ground at Buninyong. Mr. Henry
Anderson, who was the earliest pioneer in what is now known as
Winter's Flat, planted his homestead near the delta formed by the
confluence of the Woolshed Creek and the Yarrowee, Messrs. Yuille
subsequently taking that homestead and all the country now known
as Ballarat West and East and Sebastopol. These settlers gave the
name to Yuille's Swamp, more recently called Lake Wendouree. The
Bonshaw run was taken up by Mr. Anderson, 'who named it Waverley
Park, and Mr. John Winter coming into possession shortly
afterwards gave to it the present name, after his wife's home in
Scotland. Messrs. Pettett and Francis, in 1838 (as managers for
Mr. W.H.T. Clarke), took up the country at Dowling Forest, so
called after Mrs. Clarke's maiden name. Shortly after they had
settled there Mr. Francis was killed by one of his own men with a
shear-blade, at one of the stations on the run. Before Mr.
Pettett took up the Dowling Forest run he was living at the
Little River, and a native chief named Balliang offered to show
him the country about Lal Lal. The chief in speaking of it
distinguished between it and the Little River by describing the
water as La-al La-al&mdash;the a long&mdash;and by gesture
indicating the water-fall now so well known, the name signifying
falling water. Mr. Waldie subsequently took up country north-west
of Ballarat, and called his place Wyndholm, where he resided till
his decease. Messrs. Yuille had settled originally on the Barwon,
near Inverleigh, but finding the natives troublesome they retired
to Ballarat. Mr. Smythe, who with Mr. Prentice held the run, gave
the name to Smythe's Creek, as Messrs. Baillie had to the creek
at Carngham their run there being afterwards transferred to
Messrs. Russell and Simson. Mr. Darlot also occupied a run there.
Creswick Creek has its name from Henry Creswick, who settled upon
a small run there. Two brothers Creswick had previously held
country close to Warrenheip. The Messrs. Baillie were sons of Sir
William Baillie, Bart., of Polkemmet, Scotland. Mr. Andrew Scott
settled with his family at the foot of Mount Buninyong, where he
had a snug run in which the mount and its rich surrounding soil
were included. Mrs. Andrew Scott was the first lady who travelled
through this district. She drove across the dry bed of Lake
Burrumbeet in the year 1840. The country about Smeaton and
Coghill's Creek was taken up in the year 1838 by Captain Hepburn
and Mr. David Coghill who came overland from New South Wales with
sheep and cattle, following the route of Sir Thomas Mitchell in
his expedition of exploration in Port Phillip in 1836. With them
came Mr. Bowman, who also brought stock. He took up a run on the
Campaspe, while his companions came on further south. The Murray
was very low when they crossed, and the stock was easily passed
over. At the Ovens they found a dry river-bed; Lake Burrumbeet
was also dry that year. When Messrs. Hepburn and Coghill had left
sheep at the Campaspe and Brown's Creek on their way, they pushed
on, and from Mount Alexander they descried the Smeaton Hills,
and, continuing their journey, found and took up the unoccupied
country there. Smeaton Hill was called Quaratwong by the natives,
and the hill between the Glenlyon road and Smeaton Hill was
called Moorabool. Captain Hepburn, a seafaring man originally,
was one of the Hepburns of East Lothian, Scotland, and Smeaton
was named by him after the East Lothian estate held by his
relative, Sir Thomas Hepburn. Mr. Coghill was the first to plough
land at the creek which bears his name, and in which locality
there now is found one of the broadest and richest tracts of
farming land in Victoria. He brought with him overland a plough,
a harrow, and the parts of a hand steel flour-mill. In 1839 he
ploughed and sowed wheat, and thus grew and ground the first corn
grown there. In 1841 Captain Hepburn erected a water-mill for
corn on Birch's Creek; that was the first mill of that kind.
Birch's Creek was named after the brothers Arthur and Cecil
Birch, who, with the Rev. Mr. Irvine, came overland soon after
Messrs. Hepburn and Coghill, and settled at the Seven Hills.
Besides the run at Coghill's Creek, taken up by Mr. Coghill for
some others of his family. Cattle Station Hill was also taken by
him. This run lay between Glendaruel and the Seven Hills, and was
part of the purchased estate belonging to the Hepburns. The late
Captain Hepburn long acted as a justice of the peace, and he was
one of the squatters whom M'Combie mentions as having taken part
in a meeting held on the 4th of June, 1844, in front of the
Mechanics' Institute, Melbourne, to protest against Sir G. Gipps'
squatting policy, and to urge forward the movement for the
separation of Port Phillip from New South Wales. The squatters
mustered on horseback that day on Batman's Hill, and thence rode
to the meeting in Collins street, the "equestrian order" thus
giving an early example of the right freemen have, even in a
Crown colony, to air public grievances publicly and
fearlessly.</p>
<p>Lal Lal was taken up in the year 1840 by Messrs. Blakeney and
George Airey, the latter a brother of the Crimean officer so
often and so flatteringly mentioned in Kinglake's "History of the
Crimean War". In the same year, Messrs. Le Vet (or Levitt) and
another took up Warrenheip as a pig-growing station, but the
venture failed, and some of the pigs ran wild in the forest there
for years, and preyed on each other. After Messrs. Le Vet and Co.
had been there awhile, the run was taken up on behalf of Messrs.
Verner, Welsh, and Holloway, of the Gingellac run, on the Hume,
by Mr. Haverfield (at present the editor of the <i>Bendigo
Advertiser</i>), Le Vet and partner selling their improvements
for about £30. Shortly after Mr. Haverfield came to Warrenheip,
Bullarook Forest was occupied by Mr. John Peerman, for Mr. Lyon
Campbell. The Mr. Verner mentioned above was the first
Commissioner of the Melbourne Insolvency Court. He was related to
Sir William Verner, a member in the House of Commons for Armagh.
Mr. Verner took part, as chairman, at a Separation meeting held
in Melbourne on the 30th December, 1840, and soon after that he
left the colony. Mr. Welsh was the late Mr. Patricius Welsh, of
Ballarat; and Mr. Holloway became a gold-broker, and died at the
Camp at Bendigo. In the year 1843, Mr. Peter Inglis, who had a
station at Ballan, took up the Warrenheip run, and shortly after
that purchased the Lal Lal station, and throwing them both
together, grazed on the united runs one of the largest herds in
the colony. The western boundary of Mr. Inglis' Warrenheip run
marched with the eastern boundary of Mr. Yuille's run, the line
being struck by marked trees running from Mount Buninyong across
Brown Hill to Slaty Creek. Mr. Donald Stewart, now of Buninyong,
was stock-rider for Mr. Inglis, on the Warrenheip and Lal Lal
stations, and superintendent during the minority of the present
owner of Lal Lal. In 1839 Mr. W.H. Bacchus brought cattle from
Melbourne and grazed them on his run of Burrumbeetup, the centre
of which run is now occupied by the Ballan pound. There is a
waterfall on the Moorabool there, which, for its picturesque
beauty, is well worth visiting. The run extended on the Ballarat
side of the Moorabool to about midway to the Lal Lal Creek. Mr.
Bacchus still resides in the same locality, his present station
being known as Perewur, or Peerewurr, a native name, meaning
waterfall and opossums. It was originally held by Messrs.
Fairbairn and Gardner. Buninyong was a village, or township, long
before Ballarat had any existence as a settlement. The first huts
were built at Buninyong in the year 1841, by sawyers, splitters,
and others, Mr. George Innes being then called the "King of the
Splitters". George Gab, George Coleman, and others, were the
pioneers in the Buninyong settlement. Gab had a wife who used to
ride Amazonian fashion on a fine horse called Petrel, and both
husband and wife were energetic people. Gab opened a house of
accommodation for travellers on the spot where Jamison's hotel
was afterwards built. The first store in the neighborhood was
opened at the Round Water Holes, near Bonshaw, by Messrs. D.S.
Campbell and Woolley, of Melbourne, who almost immediately
afterwards removed to a site next Gab's, at Buninyong, whose
place they took for a kitchen. Gab then removed and built another
hut opposite to the present police-court, and he opened his new
hut also as a hotel. A blacksmith named M'Lachlan, with a
partner, opened a smithy opposite to Campbell and Wooley's store.
This was the nucleus of the principal inland town then in the
colony. In the year 1844 Dr. Power settled there, and built a hut
behind what was afterwards the Buninyong hotel. He was the first
medical man in the locality, and for years the settlers had no
other doctor nearer than Geelong. The young township became a
favorite place with bullock teamsters, who were glad to build
huts there where they could leave their wives and children in
some degree safe from aboriginal or other marauders. In the year
1847, the Rev. Thomas Hastie, the first clergyman in the
district, came to Buninyong. His house, and the church in which
he performed service, were built entirely by the residents in
Buninyong, both pecuniary gifts and manual labor being
contributed. Then, as afterwards, the Messrs. Learmonth were
among the foremost movers in the promotion of the mental and
moral, as well as material welfare of the people about them. Mr.
Hastie, in a letter to us, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Before I came in 1847, the Messrs. Learmonth had made
several efforts to procure the settlement of a clergyman at
Buninyong, but had failed, partly from want of support, but
chiefly from their inability to procure one likely to be
suitable. Overtures had been made to Mr. Beazely, a
Congregational minister then in Tasmania, and afterwards in New
South Wales, but he declined them. The Messrs. Learmonth were
willing to take a minister from any denomination, and the
circumstance that a Presbyterian clergyman was settled here arose
from the fact that no other was available. Until after the gold
discovery there was no minister in the interior, that is out of
Melbourne, Geelong, Belfast, and Portland, but Mr. Hamilton of
Mortlake, Mr. Gow of Campbellfield, and myself. For many years my
diocese, as it may be called, extended from Batesford, on the
Barwon, to Glenlogie, in the Pyrenees, and included all the
country for miles on either side, my duties taking me from home
more than half my time. Before I came the Messrs. Learmonth had
contemplated the establishment of a cheap boarding-school for the
children of shepherds and others in the bush, but for prudential
reasons they deferred the matter till the settlement of a
minister offered the means of supervision. Immediately after I
came the project was carried out, and subscriptions were received
from most of the settlers in the Western district. The school was
opened in 1848 by Mr. Bedwell, £10 a year being charged for board
and education.</blockquote>
<p>The gold discovery carried away the teachers, raised the
prices of everything, and Mr. Hastie had to see to the school and
its GO boarders himself; but through all the difficulties the
school was maintained with varying fortunes, until at length it
became the Common-school near the Presbyterian Manse, with an
average attendance of some 180 children.</p>
<p>What is now the boroughs of Ballarat, Ballarat East, and
Sebastopol, was then a pleasantly picturesque pastoral country.
Mount and range, and table land, gullies and creeks and grassy
slopes, here black and dense forest, there only sprinkled with
trees, and yonder showing clear reaches of grass, made up the
general landscape. A pastoral quiet reigned everywhere. Over the
whole expanse there was nothing of civilisation but a few
pastoral settlers and their retinue&mdash;the occasional flock of
nibbling sheep, or groups of cattle browsing in the broad
herbage. There were three permanent waterholes in those days
where the squatters used to find water for their flocks in the
driest times of summer. One was at the junction of the Gong Gong
and the Yarrowee, or Blakeney's Creek, as it was then called,
after the settler of that name there. Another was where the
Yarrowee bends under the ranges by the Brown Hill hotel, and the
other was near Golden Point. Aborigines built their mia-mias
about Wendouree, the kangaroo leaped unharmed down the ranges,
and fed upon the green slopes and flats where the Yarrowee rolled
its clear water along its winding course down the valley. Bullock
teams now and then plodded their dull, slow way across flat and
range, and made unwittingly the sites and curves of future
streets. Settlers would lighten their <i>quasi</i>[new?] solitude
with occasional chases of the kangaroo, where now the homes of a
busy population have made a city; it was a favorite resort of the
kangaroo, and Mr. A. Fisken, of Lal Lal, and other settlers often
hunted kangaroo where Main, Bridge, and other streets are now.
The emu, the wombat, the dingo, were also plentiful. The edge of
the eastern escarpment of the plateau where Ballarat West now is,
was then green and golden in the spring time with the indigenous
grass and trees. Where Sturt street descends to the flat was a
little gully, and its upper edges, where are now the London
Chartered Bank, the Post-office, and generally the eastern side
of Lydiard street, from Sturt street to the gaol site, were
prettily ornamented with wattles.</p>

<span class="u">"King Billy" And The Ballarat Tribe,
1851.</span></p>
<br>
<blockquote>I often passed (says Mr. Hastie) the spot on which
Ballarat is built, when visiting Mr. Waldie, and there could not
be a prettier spot imagined. It was the very picture of repose.
There was, in general, plenty of grass and water, and often I
have seen the cattle in considerable numbers lying in quiet
enjoyment after being satisfied with the pasture. There was a
beautiful clump of wattles where Lydiard street now stands, and
on one occasion, when Mrs. Hastie was with me, she remarked,
"What a nice place for a house, with the flat in front and the
wattles behind!" Mr. Waldie had at that time a shepherd's hut
about where the Dead Horse Gully is on the Creswick Road, and one
day when I was calling on the hut-keeper, he said the solitude
was so painful that he could not endure it, for he saw no one
from the time the shepherds went out in the morning till they
returned at night. I was the only person he had ever seen there
who was not connected with the station.</blockquote>
<p>The ground now occupied by Craig's hotel on one side of the
gully that ran down by the "Corner", and by the Camp buildings on
the other side, were favorite camping places in the pastoral
days. Safe from floods, and near to water and grass, the spot
invited herdsman and shepherd, bullock-driver and traveller, to
halt and repose.</p>
<p>The aborigines were nut numerous about Ballarat even in those
early days; a little earlier, however, as when Dowling Forest was
taken up, they were more numerous and were often troublesome,
being great thieves. Several of the adults were strongly marked
with small-pox at the time the locality was taken up for pastoral
occupation. The natives, were considered inferior to the Murray
tribes, and were generally indolent and often treacherous. From
time to time they were troublesome to the settlers&mdash;as well
to the good as to the bad. King Billy was the name given to the
chief of the tribes about here, and that regal personage for many
years wore a big brass plate bearing his title. He was chief of
the tribes about Mounts Buninyong and Emu, and King Jonathan, of
a Borhoneyghurk tribe, was his subordinate.</p>
<blockquote>My brother and I (says Mr. Somerville L. Learmonth)
began by feeding and being kind to the natives, but not long
after the establishment of our first out-station, on the way to
Smythesdale, we were aroused in the dead of night by the
intelligence that Teddy, the hut-keeper, had been murdered. Some
of the natives had seen the ration-cart on the previous day; they
watched until the hut-keeper went unarmed to the well for water,
his return was intercepted, and one blow with a stone hatchet
laid him dead at the murderers' feet. The hut was robbed and a
shepherd brought to the homestead the Pad intelligence. A party
started next day in pursuit of the natives, but I have often felt
thankful that we failed in finding them. On two occasions our men
were attacked, but they resisted successfully and their
assailants retired. Frequently small numbers of sheep were
missing, but beyond this, and the stealing of small things when
allowed to come near a station, the natives never injured us. I
attribute our immunity to having issued orders, which were
enforced, that the natives should on no pretext be harbored about
any station. They are most expert thieves. I remember seeing a
woman who was employed in gathering potatoes quietly raise a
large proportion with her toes, and place the potatoes in her
wallet, the others being openly put into the receptacle provided
by the employer. Another gentleman, surprised at the rapidity
with which his crop withered away, examined and found that the
tubers had been removed and the stems placed in the ground
again.</blockquote>
<p>The place where the Messrs. Learmonths' hut-keeper was
murdered was called Murdering Valley. It is near the
south-western boundary of the borough of Sebastopol, and was, a
few years ago, the scene of a more horrible tragedy than that of
the murder by the aborigines. Once in 1842 the natives were
troublesome on Mr. Inglis' run at Ballan. They had offered some
insult to a hut-keeper's wife and all the European force of the
station turned out with tin kettles, pistols, sticks and other
instruments of noise and defence or offence&mdash;a great noise
and demonstration were made to terrify the natives and thus that
trouble was got over. Mr. Hastie says that when he first came to
Buninyong the natives were "comparatively numerous". They used to
come to the manse for food, in return for which they would fetch
or break up fire wood.</p>
<p>As a pendant to the Rev. Mr. Hastie's picture of
pre-auriferous Ballarat, the following, given to the author by
Henry Hannington, will further help to illustrate the "origins"
of the place. Mr. Hannington says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I was several times about Ballarat before the
diggings in 1851. In the year 1844 I was driving a team of
bullocks for Mr. Duncan Cameron, of Pascoe Vale, from his
station. Yuille's Swamp (Lake Wendouree) was a camping place for
teams, and the bullocks generally made off for the flat by Golden
Point, where the grass was always green in the driest of summers.
The timber on the flat was white gum, not thick. The creek
opposite to Golden Point was shallow, about 15 inches deep. There
was one water hole near Grimley's Baths (between Bridge Street
and the Gas Works). I used to see a log hut or two about when I
went after the bullocks, and some sawyers and splitters had huts
and a few cattle on the ranges. The road from the Grampians to
Geelong and Melbourne was the same as at present. It went past
where the Unicorn Hotel is (opposite to the Post Office), then
round Dan. Fern's corner (Albert Street), across the creek near
Golden Point, and then to Buninyong, to the publichouse kept by
Mrs. Jamieson, who was called Mother Jamieson. From there it went
to Fisken's, near the Lal Lal Falls, for water for the teams. We
had several visits from the black lubras. The blackfellows seldom
came with them. We all had to carry firearms, as the blacks were
treacherous, and were spearing hut keepers and others every day.
I got safe with my team to Moonee Ponds, Pasco Vale, and had to
come back to the Ballarat District in 1845, as there was an order
from the Government for a few free men to join the new mounted
police, and I was sent to Mr. Edward Parker, the protector of the
blacks at Jim Crow Creek (Daylesford). I had nothing much to do.
Went once a week for the mail, and was often about Ballarat
looking up horses, as they always made for the flat opposite
Golden Point. Everything looked then pretty much as it had the
year before.</blockquote>
<p>Hannington is only one of the vouchers for the water supply of
the Yarrowee valley, but as old or older settlers than he tell
us, as we have in part seen already, of the occasional drying up
of what now seems to be permanent waters. Thus, one of the
Learmonths writing to the <i>Corn Stalk</i>, in April, 1858,
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>When we discovered the country around Burrumbeet, in
January, 1838, there were then a few inches of intensely salt
water in the lake. In June of that year the water dried up, and
in the three following years Lakes Burrumbeet and Learmonth were
quite dry and covered with coarse grass, which the cattle and
sheep fed over, and which was burned in each of these summers.
There was a little water in the middle of both lakes not
evaporated at the end of the summer of 1842, and since then there
was a gradual increase in both till 1852 when it reached its
maximum and has been fluctuating since then. All the swamps and
most of the springs that now supply water were perfectly dry, or
nearly so, in the years 1839, 1840, 1841. The Moorabool did not
run in these years, and the Leigh and the Barwon only for a few
weeks, and then not more than knee deep. During these dry seasons
Burrumbeet was fringed with a sort of myrtle, which must have
been growing there for some time, for the trees had attained a
considerable size, as may be seen by their stumps and roots which
are still visible a hundred yards within water mark. With regard
to Yuille's Swamp, from which Ballarat is supplied with water, it
also was dry in the years I have mentioned, but the water in it,
when the winter rains did not fail, was always good, which was
not the case with many of the lagoons in the
district.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Waldie corroborates Mr. Learmonth as to Yuille's Swamp,
and Mr. Learmonth, with smaller, other eyes than those of
subsequent water-supply caterers, remarks that if Yuille's Swamp
were improved by feeders from Waldie's Creek "very inexpensive
works would furnish Ballarat with an abundant and cheap supply of
water at all times."</p>
<p>Hannington, like many another waif of the old days, seems, as
we shall see by and bye, to have got stranded in the shallows
whilst other craft about him swept on to fair havens. The
squatters, too, were not fixed like the land they occupied, for
they had their exits and their entrances, as we have seen, and
many departed for good and all. It was thus with the Learmonths
eventually, albeit they remained for many years after the date of
the days of which we are now treating. Their Buninyong
pre-emptive they let on a mining lease and after that they sold
the hind. Still holding the Ercildoun estate, they ventured,
themselves, some years later, upon the fortunes of mining, and
took a quartz mine at Egerton, appointed a manager, won a good
deal of gold, then sold the mine and sued the vendees, including
the manager, who had sold as the vendors' agent and then joined
the vendees. But this matter is dealt with further down the
stream of our story. Not long after the law suit the last of the
Learmonths left the colony or was dead. Ercildoun, the place
where their famous merino flocks had borne them so many golden
fleeces, was sold to Sir Samuel Wilson, and he eventually became
an absentee, living in Earl Beaconsfield's house of Hughenden,
and after some defeats becoming a member of the House of Commons,
where he now sits as representative for Portsmouth.</p>
<p>Ballarat, or, more properly, Ballaarat, is a native name,
signifying a camping or resting place, <i>balla</i> meaning
elbow, or reclining on the elbow; all native names beginning with
<i>balla</i> have a similar significance. Wendouree is the
anglicised form of <i>Wendaaree</i>, a native word, signifying
"be off", "off you go." Yarrowee is probably a Scottish settler's
use of the Scottish <i>Yarrow</i>, with a diminutive to suit the
smaller stream. Buninyong, or, as the natives have it,
Bunning-yowang, means a big hill like a knee&mdash;<i>bunning</i>
meaning knee, and <i>yowang</i> hill This name was given by the
natives to Mount Buninyong because the mount, when seen-from a
given point, resembled a man lying on his back with his knee
drawn up. The <i>Yow-Yangs</i>, by the Werribee, is a form of
<i>Yowang</i>. Station Peak, one of the Yow-Yangs, was called
<i>Villamata</i> by the natives. Warrengeep, corrupted to
Warrenheip, means emu feathers; the name was given to Mount
Warrenheip from the appearance presented by the ferns and other
forest growths there. Gong Gong, or Gang Gang, is an aboriginal
name for a species of parrot; Burrumbeet means muddy water, and
Woady Yaloak standing water. Mount Pisgah, in the lake country,
was first known as Pettett's Look-Out, and Mount Rowan as
Shuter's Hill. Mount Blowhard had no name among the settlers
until one of Pettett's shepherd-boys gave it that name, from
having often proved the appropriateness of such a designation,
since his experiences of windy days there had been frequent.</p>
<p>As a race the Australian squatters were brave and adventurous.
Many of them were men of liberal education and broad and generous
culture, and some were men bearing old historic names, as well as
possessing the instincts and the discipline of gentlemen. Others
were vulgar boors, whose only genius lay in adding Hock to flock,
run to run, and swelling annually the balance at their bankers.
The first squatters took their lives in their hands, for they had
to fight with various enemies&mdash;a treacherous native
population, drought, hunger, and on all sides difficulties. Says
Mr. Coghill, in a <i>viva voce</i> <a name="FNanchor_04" id=
"FNanchor_04"></a><a href="#fn04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
communication to us:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Every day, I may say for ten years, I have been many
hours in the saddle. I never had much trouble with the natives,
only that they would sometimes thieve a little; but I used always
to make a point of going to them and talking to them as well as I
could, and explaining to them that if they behaved themselves
they would not be molested. I remember the bother we had with our
first wool. We did not know how to get it down to ship, and we
thought we would send it by way of Morrison's station, on the
Campaspe. We had to cross the Jim Crow ranges, and we were a week
among the gullies and creeks there before we could get a passage
with our wool across the ranges.</blockquote>
<p>The squatters were essentially explorers, and encountered all
the risks of exploration. Over mountain and valley, through
forest and across plain, they went where everything was new to
civilisation. Passing by arid, treeless, grassless wastes, mere
howling wildernesses of desolation, they pursued their way to
tracts of boundless fertility, lands flowing, prospectively, with
milk and honey, potentially rich in corn, and wine, and oil. Ever
among the virgin newness of an unsubdued country, they steered
their course by by guided by the sun or the compass; at night,
led by the skies, as, to quote the great New England poet's
melodious, child like conceit.</p>
<div style="margin-left:10%; font-size: 90%;">Silently, one by
one, in the infinite meadows of heaven,<br>
Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me nots of the
angels.</div>
<p>This may seem to be a romantic view of the squatter, but it is
a real one. It is as real as the cutty pipes, the spirit flasks,
the night rugs, the camp fires, the rivalries, ambitions,
generous hospitalities, and occasional meannesses of the race.
Doubtless they sought their own good, hut, however unwittingly,
they actually became the beneficial occupiers of the laud for
others. The teeming hosts drawn hither afterwards by the more
dazzling hopes of fortune, and becoming eventually, and not
without reason, hostile to the squatter, were in great part fed
by the countless flocks and herds which the pastoral pioneers had
spread over the wide pastures of this fair and fertile home of
all the nations. With what to the squatter must have seemed like
rash and boisterous violence, the sudden tide of population
dashed its confluent waves upon our shores, and the serried ranks
of the new army of industry marched boldly in upon the domains of
the squatter, rudely disturbed his quiet dreams of perpetual
occupation, and added at once a hundredfold to the market value
of all his possessions.</p>
<p>From the first pastoral settlement to the discovery of gold
there was a wool-growing, cattle-breeding period of something
more than one decade. In that period the courage and the
enterprise of the squatters, the real pioneers of all our
settlement, had achieved no little in the direction of the
development of the value of the main source of all national
wealth&mdash;the land. Mr. M'Combie, in his "History of
Victoria", remarks of the early years of settlement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>During the ten years that the province of Port
Phillip had been settled, it had been daily progressing in
population and wealth. Vast interests had been silently growing
up, and new classes were beginning to emerge into importance. All
depended upon the land. The first wealth of Port Phillip was
acquired from pastoral pursuits, and nearly every person was
either directly or indirectly engaged in squatting.</blockquote>
<p>But while those "vast interests had been silently growing up",
there had been occasional premonitions of a rapid and turbulent
change. While the shepherds fed their flocks by night and by day,
other voices than those of angels in the air were heard in some
places. In some of the more picturesque nooks of the district
traversed by the Pyrenees and their off-shoots, the solitary
shepherd, or squatter, on one or two occasions, or oftener still,
saw sudden visions of easily won and boundless immediate wealth.
Where the broad belts of purple forest spread out, and fair green
glades and glens and ravines stretched over the swelling ranges
of the district, the bushman wandered from silence to silence
that only the elements or the birds of the native woods ever
disturbed. Then it was that the first whisperings were heard of
the rich secrets of the unmeasured geologic ages, and the first
gleams were caught of the visions that had in them, however dim
and formless then, the promise of a more brilliant epoch. But it
may be well supposed that those hardy pioneers recked not then,
even as they knew not, of the troubles that would fall to the
squatter with the sturdy democracy of the then coming time. They
were lords of all they surveyed. Of all earth-hungerers, they
were, assuredly, among the hungriest, for, as Westgarth says,
they had "a cormorant capacity for land". Over tens of thousands
of acres of broad lands they roamed in the jocund spirit of
undisputed occupation, and the still broader future lay
unexplored, though even then the democratic invasion was
imminent. The visions we wot of had been seen, but if seen were
not all revealed. They were not at once blazoned forth to the
public ear, but stealthily treasured or stealthily told, for
instinct of change, of hope, of fear, more or less held back all
who had seen the bright spectacle. The governing authorities
heard of the things seen, and were offered proofs of the reality
of the fateful discovery; but the same instinct and horror of
change restrained them also from giving the revelations to the
world. But the secret had escaped for ever when the first
glittering speck glared as a lurid omen of evil, or lit up bright
hopes that fell like a burst of sudden sunshine upon the silent,
solitary settler. The new thing might be feared, or worshipped,
fought against or cherished by the timid or selfish possessors of
office and settlements, but it was to master all their purposes.
Thus was foreshadowed the quicker entry of Australia among the
peoples and the nations, the coming of the population from all
the corners of the earth to overrun the quiet haunts of the
squatter and the shepherd, the beginning of the new interests,
and a grander destiny for the whole continent.<br></p>

<div class="dropcap"><img alt="" src=

<div>O T E N T as was the wonderful lamp of Aladdin, and
magnificent as were its successes, the power of gold has equalled
in its marvellous effects all that the warm orient fancy has
pictured for us in the Arabian Nights. Gold has done even more
than ever mere magician achieved. It certainly has operated
magically in Australia, and in no part of the country has it
created greater marvels than in Ballarat. Everywhere the
resistless charm operates similarly, but it is not everywhere
that its material results are alike notable. California and
Australia have caught the more gorgeous lights and colors, and
though some dark shadows mingle with the magnificence of the
general results, the gold discovery in both countries has worked
prodigies, and many of its creations remain. They not only
remain, but are in themselves seminal powers forecasting greater
wonders in the future. All that lies in the unknown future of
this continent must be connected with the past and the present,
and these, in their grander features, take their form from the
matrix in which they were born&mdash;the gold discovery of the
year 1851.</div>
<br>
<p>California electrified Europe and the United States by its
gold discoveries in the years 1848-9, and that event was soon
followed by the discovery of gold in Australia. Geologists who
had studied maps and noted the auriferous mountain lines of the
Ural and California, no sooner heard of Australian strata and the
bearings of the mountains and ranges, than the existence of gold
in this island continent was predicted. In the older settlements,
too, of New South Wales, the aboriginies and the whites had
occasionally stumbled upon glittering metals, as afterwards they
did also in Victoria; but it was the Californian prospector,
Hargreaves, who first publicly demonstrated the existence of gold
in Australia. Actually, the discovery by others seems to have
occurred both in New South Wales and Victoria about the time of
the Californian rush in the year 1849. From a despatch dated 11th
June, 1851, to Earl Grey from Sir C.A. Fitz Roy, then Governor of
New South Wales, we learn that some two years before then a Mr.
Smith announced to Sir Charles' Government the discovery of gold.
A dispatch from Mr. Latrobe, the Governor of Victoria at the time
of Esmond's discoveries, mentions the discovery of gold some two
or three years previously in the Victorian Pyrenees. Smith was
attached to some ironworks at Berrima. He showed a lump of golden
quartz to the Chief Secretary in Sydney, and offered, upon terms,
to reveal the locality of his discovery. The Sydney Government,
if we may take the Governor's despatch as a guide, had some
doubts both as to the veracity of the applicant and the propriety
of making known his discovery even if a reality.</p>
<blockquote>Apart (says Sir C.A. Fitz Roy) from my suspicions
that the piece of gold might have come from California, there was
the opinion that any open investigation by the Government would
only tend to agitate the public mind, and divert persons from
their proper and more certain avocations.</blockquote>
<p>Then, on the 3rd April, 1851, Mr Hargreaves appeared upon the
scene, Smith having vanished in refusing to "trust to the
liberality" of the Sydney Government. Mr. Hargreaves was a man of
greater faith than Smith, and he disclosed the localities in
which he had discovered the precious metal. The localities were
near Bathurst. The news spread all over the colonies, and the
Bathurst and adjacent districts were rushed, to the great terror
of quiet pastoral Settlers, and the annoyance of the respectable
Government of Sydney. From the Governors despatches to Downing
Street, it appears that the official mind was much agitated what
to do. Settlers advised absolute prohibition of gold digging, and
the authorities were in doubt as to whether it might be safe to
impose regulations and a tax. Counsel's opinion was obtained as
to the property of the Crown in the precious mineral, and
ultimately a license tax of thirty shillings per month was levied
upon the Bathurst diggers. The Rev. W.B. Clark, the geologist,
gave excellent geological and political advice at the time, in
the columns of the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>. He sagaciously
remarked that "the momentary effect of the gold mania may be to
upset existing relations; but the effect will be a rapid increase
of population, and the colony must prepare herself for an
important growth in her influence upon the destinies of the
world."</p>
<p>The police despatches to the Sydney authorities described the
miners as "quiet and peaceable, but almost to a man armed",
wherefore the officer advised, "that no police power could
enforce the collection of dues against the feeling of the
majority." Hargreaves came to the aid of the authorities as a man
strong in counsel and Californian experience. A minute of
Hargreaves' is worth noting&mdash;"There existed (he says) no
difficulty in obtaining the fees in California." But this was no
marvel, as will be seen by the following revelation. "All the
people (he continues) at the mines are honest and orderly. I was
alcadi there. If a complaint be made the alcadi summonses a jury,
and the decision is submitted to. A man found guilty of stealing
is hung immediately." This was not less direct as a system of
jurisprudence than that practised, as Dixon and Dilke tell us, by
the sheriff of Denver, on the buffalo plains of America, where
criminals had a very brief shrift and a quick nocturnal "escape"
up the gallows tree. Yet we do not learn that in Denver, or
anywhere else in that part of America, "all the people" were
either honest or orderly, as Alcadi Hargreaves says they were in
California. But then the Sydney prospector left his aleadiship in
the early days, when the Arcadian simplicity of mining society
had not yet lost the fresh bloom of what we will take to have
been its early and honest youth. The Bathurst diggers appear to
have behaved pretty well on the whole.</p>
<p>In July, 1851, occurred what the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>
called "a most marvellous event", namely, the discovery of a mass
of gold 106 lbs. weight imbedded in quartz. This made everybody
wild with excitement. The <i>Bathurst Free Press</i>, of 16th
July, said&mdash;"Men meet together, stare stupidly at each
other, talk incoherent nonsense, and wonder what will happen
next." Some blacks in the employment of a Dr. Kerr found this
prize, their master appropriated it, and gave the finders two
flocks of sheep, besides some bullocks and horses. Possibly this
was the basis of Charles Reade's great nugget incident in his
"Never Too Late to Mend". It may be noted here that last November
the discovery of a similar mass took place at Braidwood, in New
South Wales. The weight of the specimen was given at 350 lbs., of
which two-thirds were estimated to be pure gold. We may conclude
this notice of the discovery of gold in New South Wales by
quoting the first assay of gold as given in the Government
despatches from Sydney, under date 24th May, 1851. This assay was

<p>Victoria was not long behind New South Wales in finding a
gold-field, and it soon caused the elder colony to pale its
ineffectual fires in the greater brilliance of the Victorian
discoveries. James William Esmond was to Victoria what Hargreaves
was to New South Wales. Esmond, like Hargreaves, had been at the
Californian gold-fields, and had an impression that the
Australian soil was also auriferous. He left Port Phillip for
California in June, 1849, observed that there were similarities
in soil and general features between Clunes and California, and
decided to return and explore his Australian home for gold. It
chanced that Esmond and Hargreaves were fellow passengers on
their return from California to Sydney. Esmond found gold on the
northern side of the hill opposite to Cameron's, subsequently
M'Donald's pre-emptive right, at Clunes, on Tuesday, the 1st of
July, 1851, and gold was found about the same time at Anderson's
Creek, near Melbourne.</p>
<p>According to a letter written by Esmond to the <i>Ballarat
Courier</i> on the 4th November, 1884, it appears that the above
dates may be shifted a little. Esmond says in his <i>Courier</i>
letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>On the 29th of June, 1851, I discovered gold in
quartz and alluvial at Clunes, and brought it to Geelong. I
showed the same to William Patterson, then watchmaker, afterwards
assayer for the Bank of Australia, who tested the samples in the
presence of Mr. Alfred Clarke, of the <i>Geelong Advertiser</i>,
who reported my discovery on the following Monday, the 8th July,
1851. During that week I never heard of any gold discovery having
been made or spoken of, except the discovery at Clunes. Previous
to the discovery of gold in California, it was reported that a
shepherd on McNeil and Hall's station at the Pyrenees discovered
a lump of gold, and that he sold it to a person named Brentani, a
jeweller in Melbourne. Captain Dana and his black troopers were
sent up to ascertain if there was any truth in the reported
discovery. A few people assembled on the ground to seek for the
precious metal, but they all failed. I was living in the locality
at the time, but did not go to the rush, believing it to be a
hoax; but I thought differently after returning from the
Californian diggings, which I visited in 1849. Anderson's Creek
was the first diggings I heard of after Clunes was opened, Mr.
Mitchell being the discoverer, and Buninyong was the next, by Mr.
Hiscocks. *&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;* In a few weeks afterwards I
returned to Clunes, and collected a sample of gold, some 8 oz. or
9 oz., which I sent to Mr. Patterson, of Geelong. This was the
first sample of gold sold or produced in the Victorian market. My
object in writing this letter, sir, is to inform the public where
the first payable gold-field in the colony of Victoria was
opened, and what I state I don't think any person will
dispute.</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Esmond published his discovery in Geelong on the 6th of July,
Hargreaves having preceded him in the sister colony by some two
months. But we have seen that before Hargreaves there was a
Smith, who would not accept the terms of the Sydney Government,
and so disappeared. There was yet another discoverer earlier than
the man of the Berrima ironworks. Mr. John Phillips, late
Government mineralogical surveyor, and then mining surveyor for
the Victorian Government at St. Arnaud, discovered gold in South
Australia before any of the explorers previously mentioned. He
announced his discoveries to the authorities in South Australia
and Port Phillip, and to Sir Roderick Murchison, but neither of
the local Governments acted upon his discovery. The discovery by
Mr. Phillips was about synchronous with discoveries made by the
Rev. W.B. Clarke, and had been foreshadowed in the geological
predictions of Sir Roderick Murchison and Count Strzelecki. Mr.
Phillips got nothing for his pains, and Esmond was less fortunate
than Hargreaves in the matter of public recognition and reward.
To Hargreaves were voted £10,000 by the Government of New South
Wales, and subsequently £2381 by the Victorian Parliament,
Esmond, after a hard light, receiving a vote of £1000 from the
Parliament of Victoria, and some small public, quasi-public, and
private rewards besides. But he did not receive the amount all at
once, though early proposed. On the 5th October, 1854, Dr.
Greeves proposed, in the Legislative Council, a vote of £5000 to
Hargreaves, and in his speech he admitted that Esmond was "the
first actual producer of alluvial gold for the market." The
motion was carried. Mr. Strachan moved, supported by the late Mr.
Haines, and only seven others, an amendment for giving £1000 each
to Hargreaves, Esmond, Hiscock, Mitchell, and Clarke, and £500 to
a Dr. Bruhn, who was said by Dr. Greeves to have advised Esmond
as to the existence of gold in Victoria. There was an earlier
discovery than Esmond's in Victoria, asserted by Mr. J. Wood
Beilby, as the repository of a secret from the person who was
said to have been the actual discoverer. But Beilby does not
claim for public revelation, but only as the revealer to the
Government of the day. In a pamphlet published by Dwight, of
Melbourne, in Beilby's interests as a claimant for State reward,
the following statement is found:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Mr. J. Wood Beilby establishes, by the production
(from the Chief Secretary's office) of his correspondence with
Mr. La Trobe, and concurring documentary evidence, the fact that,
so early as 7th June, 1851, or some weeks earlier than Mr. Wm.
Campbell, he informed the Government of the existence of gold in
workable deposits at the locality now known as Navarre, and in
the ranges of the Amherst district. Mr. B. does not claim to have
been the original discoverer, but to have placed the information
before Government, for the benefit of the public, at the critical
period when its value in arresting the threatened exodus of our
population to Bathurst was immense. Mr. La Trobe was at first
very incredulous, evidently not having been made aware
previously, of the existence of gold as one of the mineral
products of Victoria, as his reply, by letter of 11th June, 1851,
demonstrates. Mr. B., however, supplied further details of
information, and, waiting upon him personally, so urged
investigation, offering to share expenses, that Mr. La Trobe
organised a prospecting party, including Mr. David Armstrong,
then a returned Californian digger, afterwards gold commissioner,
and the late Capt. H.E.P. Dana, attended by a party of native
police; Mr. Commissioner Wright, resident at the Pyrenees, being
nominated to act with the gentlemen of the party as a board of
enquiry. From various causes the expedition was delayed starting
from the Aboriginal Police Depôt, Narree Worran, until a few days
before the publication of Mr. Campbell's letter. But the news was
made public. Although Mr. La Trobe had requested Mr. Beilby to
abstain from further publication of the fact until the result of
his investigations, the officials named to accompany the
expedition, and their subordinates and outfitters, were not
tongue-tied or bound to secrecy. It is, therefore, no matter of
surprise that their intended prospecting trip to the Pyrenees was
bruited far and wide; and, as a sequence, their investigations
forestalled by the discoveries at Clunes.<br>
<br>
In or about 1847-8, William Richfould, the author of the
discovery published by Mr. Beilby, was a shepherd in the
employment of Mr. W.J.T. Clarke, at his upper outstation on the
Heifer Station Creek, Navarre. He was an intelligent and
observant man, and always looking for and preserving natural
curiosities. He discovered water-worn gold in the crevices of a
brownish slate rock, in the bed and sides of the creek close to
the ranges, and also found a few specimens of gold in quartz upon
the surrounding ranges. These specimens he from time to time
disposed of. In 1848, finding himself followed and watched by his
fellow servants too closely, and being at the time desirous of
selling some valuable specimens, he journeyed westward, and
meeting Mr. Armstrong, an employé of S.G. Henty, Esq., at the
Grange, he was induced to visit Portland, and disposed of his
gold to merchants there, by whom it was sent to Tasmania as
Californian gold; being probably represented to them as such, the
then current popular belief being that all gold deposits belong
to the Queen, and that its appropriation by an unauthorised
person was punishable. Richfould then engaged as shepherd with
Mr. Beilby at Mount Gambler, and shortly after showed Mr. B. some
small specimens of gold he had retained, refusing, however, at
that period, to give any information as to the locality of his
discovery. Subsequently, in July, 1849, he divulged his secret to
Mr. B. on his pledge to keep it, unless its publication was
required by public emergency, or the discoverer died. Richfould
after this left Mr. B.'s service, professedely to return to the
scene of his discoveries. Nothing certain is now known of his
subsequent history, but his death was shortly afterwards reported
in the Mount Gambier district.</blockquote>
<p>Some two years before either Esmond's or Beilby's dates there
was a discovery of gold at the Pyrenees asserted by one Chapman,
who sold gold to a jeweller in Melbourne, named Brentani. Chapman
was at that time shepherd at Mr. Hall's station near the
Pyrenees, the locality of the subsequently opened Daisy Hill
diggings. Brentani and his trade hands made up a secret party
with Chapman to go to the Pyrenees and get "a dray-load of gold".
They went, but did not get the dray-load of gold, and Chapman
mysteriously disappeared and was not heard much of again.
Brentani and his men do not seem to have pushed their search or
disclosed what they had heard, or seen, or done. M'Combie also
mentions the finding of gold in quartz by W. Campbell, of
Strathlodden (M.L.C.), in March, 1849, at Burnbank, and also at
Clunes, near where Esmond subsequently made his more fertile
discovery. Clunes was named by Mr. Donald Cameron after a farm at
Inverness in Scotland.</p>
<p>Mr. Bacchus, of Perewur, in whose service Chapman had once
been, chanced to meet Chapman in Sydney. Mr. Bacchus wrote a
letter on the 1st July, 1851, which was published in the
<i>Argus</i>, and copied into the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> of
the 23rd July, 1851, and in that letter he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Chapman is an old servant of mine, and I have every
reason to believe his story. He says he left Melbourne for Sydney
because he felt himself watched, and was regularly hunted for
information as to where he had found the gold. He says he never
took Brentani and Duchesne within miles of the place, and gives
an excellent reason for not doing so. His story is plain and
straightforward, and from his description of the place I think he
might be able to put any one in the way of claiming the reward.
He offers to show the exact place at which he picked up the piece
of gold, for the sum of £50 and his passage from
Sydney.</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Mr. Bacchus, writing to us with the alcove enclosure,
states:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>About the same time I wrote to another person in
Victoria:&mdash;"From what I have heard and seen of the
description of country where gold is found in this Colony
(N.S.W.) I have no doubt that it can be obtained in Lerderderg
and other creeks running from Mount Blackwood and Bullencrook
towards Bacchus Marsh." And so it was a few weeks after. I give
another extract of a letter to me from a friend in Victoria,
dated in July, 1851;&mdash;"Coming from one so well-known as
yourself your letter in the <i>Argus</i> attracted great
attention, and has been the means of preventing numbers from
leaving here for Sydney. No end of people have set out in the
direction indicated by you."</blockquote>

<br>
<p>The reward referred to by Mr. Bacchus was advertised by the
Port Phillip Government, the disclosure of Hargreaves' discovery
having compelled the Government here to abandon its previous
policy of fear as to the possible consequences of such a
discovery, as it was expected there would be a wholesale exodus
to New South Wales. The Lerderderg locality has been proved, as
Mr. Bacchus states, to be auriferous, but the country there has
not been very rich in the precious metal.</p>
<p>The recommendation of the Committee of Parliament, prior to
the year 1857, was that £10,000 be divided amongst certain
claimants, and that Hargreaves should have £5000 and Esmond
£1000, but the Parliament reduced Hargreaves' vote to £2500 and
Esmond's to £500; the £10,000 recommended to the batch of
claimants selected being reduced one-half. There appears to have
been a motion carried by Dr. Greeves for a vote of £5000 to
Hargreaves, but that must have been a conditional vote or else a
reversal took place, as the final award was only half the sum
recommended by the Committee. Humffray, in July, 1857, enquired
in the Assembly why Esmond had not had the £1000; and
subsequently the Parliament did the tardy justice to the Clunes
discoverer of voting him the balance of the £1000 originally
recommended. Ten years after Humffray's question as to Esmond,
namely&mdash;in July, 1857, Frazer moved in Hargreaves' interest
and asked the Assembly to vote him £2619, the balance of the sum
recommended by the Committee of Parliament. The motion was
refused by the House, but by a narrow majority, nineteen voting
for and twenty-one against the motion. Most people, probably,
will be of opinion that Hargreaves was amply rewarded, whatever
may be thought of the official recognition of Victorian
discoverers. To them the Governments and Parliaments appear to
have shown a rather wayward disposition, and to have distributed
votes upon principles not always very obvious. The persistent
refusal of recognition of Beilby's claim seems to be an instance
in point, for though he could not claim as a producer of gold he
gives evidence of priority as a revealer of its existence, and it
is reasonable to presume that his revelation was one of the
impulses that led to explorations whose results are now before
the world. The reward paid to Hiscock for the discovery of a
locality which scarcely paid the miner as a gold-Held, contrasts
also with the non-recognition of Connor's and Merrick's parties
who discovered Ballarat itself. If any principle should be held
to have guided the Governments of the day, it may be assumed that
valuable discovery, not barren discovery, first claimed
attention. Yet Hargreaves, who discovered nothing in Victoria,
got more than Esmond, and Beilby, who first announced discovery,
and Connor's and Merrick's parties, who actually discovered
Ballarat, have received nothing. It must be felt that if
Hargreaves merited what he received some of the Victorian
discoverers and revealers met with scant acknowledgment, and that
amongst these last the unfortunate J. Wood Beilby, and the Golden
Point discoverers, may be included.</p>
<p>As soon as Esmond's discovery was known prospecting parties
set out from the seaboard, and early in August the late Mr.
Hiscock found gold in the gully near Buninyong which now bears
his name. The ground was poor and was abandoned as richer fields
were soon discovered. The Ballarat gold-held was discovered by
other prospectors, two only of whom were in Ballarat in 1870,
namely&mdash;Wm. Woodward, a French polisher, living in Chancery
lane (late Eureka street), Ballarat West; and Rd. Turner, a house
decorator, living in Raglan street south, Ballarat West. Of these
two, Turner only survives, and is still here. Woodward was in
Connor's party of six persons, namely&mdash;Connor, Woodward,
Brown, Jeanes, Smith, and Thornton. Turner was with four others,
namely&mdash;Dunn, Merrick, Wilson, and a man named Charlie, the
party having, from Alfred Clarke, the name of the Geelong Mutual
Mining Association. Merrick, some years since, was mining at
Dolly's Creek, Connor and Brown are dead, Thornton was lately at
Miners' Rest, and Dunn, Jeanes, and Smith in Geelong. Both
parties left Geelong for Clunes, but on the way met Alfred
Clarke, who informed them of Hiscock's discovery, and they
therefore began digging at Hiscock's, Gully, but the ground did
not pay. Preserving the tenses of the first edition, when the
author had personal interviews with the discoverers, we must say
that Woodward and Turner differ a little in some of their dates
and facts, and appear in some sort to be rival claimants for the
honor of the discovery of Golden Point. Woodward asserts for his
party the exclusive right to whatever honor belongs to the
discovery, while Turner claims for his party equal credit as
being discoverers simultaneously with Connor's party. Woodward
says the discovery was made by Brown on Monday, the 25th of
August; Turner says it was made by himself and Merrick on Sunday,
the 24th, and that Brown made his discovery on the same day.
Woodward says that on the 25th Brown was sent out to prospect and
returned the same day, saying he had found gold in every dishful
of dirt, and wanted men and the cradle to go with him. On the
26th three others of the party went with Brown and the cradle,
and got 4½ oz. of gold for the first two hours' work. That day
they first used the cradle, and for the first day's full work
obtained 30 oz. of gold. Woodward also says that Turner and
Merrick's party reached the Point on the Tuesday, but not
earlier. Turner avers, on the contrary, that on the Sunday he and
Merrick went out to look&mdash;as advised by some diggers in
Geelong returned from California&mdash;for hills with quartz
gravel and boulders. They went by way of Winter's Flat, ascended
the ranges, found a ¼ oz. of gold in a tin dishful of dirt,
carefully concealed the traces of their prospecting, returned to
Buninyong, and told the news to their partners. He states that on
the Monday both his party and Connor's party left Buninyong for
the Point, his own party being bogged in Winter's Plat by the
way, and part only reaching the Point that night, the remainder
arriving next day. Merrick, as Turner avers, commenced cradling
on the Tuesday morning, for the purpose of being able to say they
were the first to do so. They obtained 9 oz. or 10 oz. of gold
during the first week, being less fortunate in that respect than
Connor's party. Turner admits that Connor's party were the first
to arrive at the Point, but he says it was on Monday, and that a
few hours later on the same day some of Turner and Merrick's
party were also there. Both parties agree that they were there
together on the Tuesday, and that all the men on the field then
were only about half a score. Dunn, writing from memory at
Chilwell, Geelong, on the 9th of February, 1870, sent the
following letter to Turner:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Dear Sir,&mdash;In answer to yours of the 8th inst.,
I shall give you a full and true account of our gold prospecting,
and the first discovery of Golden Point, as follows:&mdash;1st.
Richard Turner, James Merrick, Thomas Dunn, George Wilson,
Charles Gerrard, James Batty. 2nd. Started from town on Tuesday,
8th August, 1851; met with an accident on Batesford Hill, the
loaded dray passing over the driver's stomach, left him at Mrs.
Primrose's with the Chinese Doctor, proceeding on journey (for
the Clunes) but stopped at Buninyong near a fortnight. The party
getting dissatisfied, Wilson and I agreed to go in search of
better diggings, so we started from Buninyong on the Sunday
morning 24th August, 1851, between 10 and 11 o'clock, with tin
dish and shovel to find the Black Hill; reached there about 2
o'clock, saw Greenwood's party with a few specks of the color,
left the Black Hill about half-past three. In coming over
Winter's Flat, I says to George&mdash;"There is a likely little
quartz hill, let us try it before we go home." It was pouring of
rain at the time. So with that I cut a square turf, then partly
filled the dish and went to the creek to wash it. Oh, what joy!
there was about ten or twelve grains of fine gold. So we left
off, covered up with turf, and made for home as fast as possible
through the rain; reached home like two drowned rats; started
next morning early for our new discovery; reached there in the
afternoon; had the cradle at work next morning. I firmly believe
that I, Thomas Dunn, and George Wilson were the first men, and
got the first gold, on the little quartz hill now known as Golden
Point. If there is any one that can dispute this letter let them
come forward publicly like men.</blockquote>

<div class="quote" style="text-align:right;"><span class=
"u">THOMAS DUNN.</span></div>
<br>
<p>From memory in Ballarat, since giving us an oral statement,
Woodward writes the following as to the discovery:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Connor, Woodward, Jeanes, Thornton, and Brown left
Geelong, Wednesday, 20th August, 1851. Smith arrived on Sunday,
24th August. Brown started (for new ground) Monday morning, 25th.
Meeting on Monday evening to petition against paying license-fee
for the month of September on account of gold not being
sufficient to pay expenses. On the 26th Brown came back for three
more men, horse and curt and cradle, and the two first hours'
work gave 4½ oz. Commissioners arrived on Friday, 19th September,
asking for Connor's party; taking the pannikin up with the gold
remarking&mdash;"This is a proof it will pay the license-fee." On
the 20th Commissioner sends for Connor to pay the license-fee for
the remainder of the month. After Connor had paid the license he
was pelted with clay and bonnetted. A public meeting was held
outside the bark hut in the hearing of the Commissioners, Herbert
Swindells on the stump. Resolutions passed that no one pay the
license for September, as we had petitioned against it. The
meeting no sooner over than the (Commissioners') hut was rushed
to pay the license, as them that did not pay would loose their
ground&mdash;Conner's party receiving 16 feet square each, double
the ground to what others had. Herbert Swindells was refused a
license to dig on account of taking the stump at the meeting. A
collection was made for him of 12 oz. of gold which he lost the
same night. This is a correct list of facts.</blockquote>
<div class="quote" style="text-align:right;"><span class="u">W.
WOODWARD.</span></div>
<br>
<p>Merrick, writing from Morrison's Diggings, on the 24th
February, 1870, to Mr. James Oddie, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>As to the time or date of our arrival on Golden Point
I do not remember, but as to the day and circumstances they are
simply as follows:&mdash;I formed the party at first with the
intention of proceeding to Esmond's Diggings, and on the road we
tried Hiscock's Hill, found it would not pay, so we agreed at the
end of the week to send George Wilson, one of our party, to the
Brown Hill to see if Lindsay and party had found gold. If they
had not we were to start for the Clunes on the Monday morning.
George went up on Saturday or Sunday returning over Golden Point,
the flat being flooded. He tried a dishful of gravel and got a
nice prospect&mdash;some of the bits like small shots flattened.
When we had seen the prospect we determined to start for the
place next morning early, so that we should not be noticed
leaving. On our arrival at Yuille's Flat our cart got bogged, so
three of our party, the carter, and horse, started for the Point,
taking with them as many things as they could, leaving two of the
party to mind the cart. When they got to the Point to their
surprise they found Connor's party just arrived. The cart was
soon got up and the tents commenced putting up. Most of our party
were for finishing tent and other odd jobs, and commence washing
the next week, but I said, "No for I intend to be the first that
ever worked a cradle in this place." It was agreed I should, and
I cradled the remainder of the week, but no other party began
till next Monday or Tuesday following, except they tin-dished it.
My party consisted of six men, but Mr. Batty did not come up with
us. Their names are as follows:&mdash;T. Batty, R. Turner, Dunn,
G. Wilson, C. Fitzgerald, J.F.C. Merrick.</blockquote>
<p>Thus was opened the gold-field of Ballarat, and the honor of
discovery seems to be tolerably evenly balanced between the two
claiming parties. Turner does not, though Dunn does, assert
priority of discovery for his party, and he admits that Connor's
party were first on the Point on the first working day, Woodward
making Tuesday and Turner making Monday to be that day. Merrick
does not assert priority either, save as to the use of the
cradle. It may, perhaps, be held that the balance of priority
inclines to the side of Connor's party, and it is said in support
of Connor's claim that he was always regarded as leader of the
diggers at the meetings held in those first days when the
authorities made their first demand of license fees. Then it is
seen from Woodward's statement that the Commissioner recognised
Connor's claim to priority, and gave the party a double area.
Swindells fared worse than our modern men of the stump, and
appears to have been less mindful of No. 1 than his less
scrupulous descendants. It is worthy remark, as already shown,
that none of these actual discoverers and openers of the Ballarat
gold-field ever received any reward from the Government, though
Hiscock had, and Esmond also, Hargreaves, however, as already
stated, having the lion's share. So far, it must be said,
Victoria has acted with less liberality to her own children than
to the stranger's. As to Hiscock's gold cup, lately (1870)
exhibited here as the product of gold got in Hiscock's Gully,
Woodward affirms that the cup was not made of gold discovered
there.</p>
<p>Writing to Mr. James Oddie, from Tarnagulla, under date 29th
May, 1884, William Brownbill, the discoverer of gold at what is
now known as Brown Hill, on the road to the Gong Gong,
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>In the early portion of 1851, having donned the blue
shirt, I resolved to swim with the tide and take the first job
that presented itself.
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; Took a job
rebuilding Mr. Cray's station, which had suffered by the fire on
black Thursday, and while there very exciting stories were told
of the Sydney gold-fields, and several hands left the station for
that new enterprise. Not long after the Sydney fields had been
noised abroad it was stated that there had been gold found at
Buninyong by a blacksmith named Hiscock. Hearing that a great
many people had gone there in search of gold I decided to go to
Buninyong and see for myself what could be done. Judge, then, my
disappointment to find that this diggings of Hiscock's was just
about being deserted, parties chopfallen and discouraged selling
their outfit, consisting of a tarpaulin, spade, pick, tin dish,
for the merest trifle. During the evening, however, at the hotel
I fraternised with a gentleman, a reporter for one of the Geelong
papers, who had come up to take stock, and from him I learned
that some new place had been discovered some miles out in the
bush. He and I made our way to the place and found Dunlop and
Regan, the discoverers, with about six or seven other parties on
a small hill (Golden Point) scratching up dirt and washing it in
a tin dish, where specks of gold became visible. Upon my
attempting to follow their example I was informed that that side
of the hill belonged to them and that I had better look for a
place for myself. Under these circumstances I was constrained to
take my stand on the other side which was afterwards called
Poverty Point. Not many days elapsed before feeling discouraged,
and I struck out across the bush in search of fresh fields,
trying bits of dirt here and there as I went along. In this way,
then, I came to the place which in honor of my discovery the
diggers called "Brownbill's Diggings" and which afterwards
degenerated into "The Brown Hill". We commenced work and must
have been some considerable time there when Governor La Trobe,
accompanied by Captain Dana and some black police, came up to see
the place, Brownbill's diggings being the first visited. Upon my
showing the Governor the manner in which gold was obtained he
remarked to me&mdash;"Your mother did not think when you came to
Australia that you were going to dig gold out of the ground in
that manner." &nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; "I
have never received so much as a shilling in the shape of reward
from the Government, my repeated applications being rejected on
the plea that my discovery was too near another
diggings.</blockquote>
<p>Other parties from the seaboard were quickly on the trail of
the Golden Point prospectors, and Hiscock's Gully-workers soon
repaired to the richer locality. Hannington, whom we left
revisiting pre-auriferous Ballarat, so to speak, in 1845, turns
up again as we pursue his story. He goes on thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>After that I went exploring, and did not visit
Ballarat again till 1851, where I arrived 28th August, and sunk
several shallow holes about Poverty Point. There was not much
gold getting then on Golden Point. Found a few specks in the
grass, and put down a hole five feet deep. The gold was all over
the bottom like a jeweller's shop. There were some rows
commencing over the claims then. I was about the fourth claim on
the Point, and people coming every hour. We carried the dirt down
to the creek in bags and washed it in dishes, and after that we
got cradles. Some of the men that came washed with gloves on
their hands. There was doctors and lawyers. Mr. Ocock, from
Geelong, was one. Then the flat below the Point started, and I
got another hole there about 10 feet deep, and could see gold all
over the bottom. Worked it out, and went off in the night, as
there was sticking up beginning then. Made for William Ritchie's
hotel, on the Geelong road, and got there by daylight, and came
back after placing our gold safe. This time we pitched our tent
on the very spot where the School of Mines is now, to be in sight
of our claim. Cleared off a large heap of earth, and sunk 12
feet, and it seemed to be a little gutter. It was like looking
into a ginger bread basket, it looked so yellow with gold. We
were doing well, but was near being stuck up one night, only I
happened to be about, as I heard steps, and sang out to them to
retreat or I should fire. They stuck up two others that night. We
soon worked out that hole, for we were surrounded by claims, the
next to us being James Pugh, mate of Esmond's. We sold the claim
for two ounces of gold, and went up to Mount Alexander. Came back
again in 1852, six months after, and found one man only on Golden
Point, and that was the same man we sold our claim to, as the
others all left. He said to me that he had averaged six ounces a
day since we left. I did not do well at Mount Alexander, and went
to Big Bendigo. Did well at Eaglehawk, but speculated in property
at Melbourne, and got into the money-lenders' hands, and lost
all, so came back to Ballarat again after trying other diggings
unsuccessfully, and remained up to the present time (September,
1886.)</blockquote>
<p>Teddy Shannahan, whose story about the Eureka Stockade will be
found further on, gives some touches of the times when the first
rushes had set the colony ablaze. From notes furnished by
gentlemen on the staff of the <i>Ballarat Courier</i>, after an
interview with Shannahan, the author culls the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>My party arrived at Buninyong in 1851, just after
Esmond and Dunlop, and we went on Golden Point a few days
afterwards, where we got 8 oz from a bucketful of stuff. I saw
one poor fellow killed by the fall of a tree which he had
undermined recklessly, so anxious was he to get the gold. One day
a commissioner and a trooper demanded my license, and, as I had
not one, they took me, with a lot of others, to the camp, where
we were guarded by eight or nine blackfellows, and they, with
their polished boots, were looking as proud as possible. I got my
license, after telling them my mind, and had to pay £10 in all.
We went to Mount Alexander and Fryers' Creek and on to Bendigo,
where we had our pick of a squatter's flock of sheep for 9s. a
head. We were the first to sink in Long Gully. At Eaglehawk you
could see the gold shining in the heap of dirt, and every man sat
on his heap all night with pistol or some weapon in his hand; I
thought they would be making picks and shovels of the gold, it
was so plentiful. It was there the first nugget was found, one 9
lbs. in weight. We only got £3 an ounce for our gold. In a week
or two we started for Geelong, where my family was, and "home,
home," was the cry. Each of our party took about 8 lbs. weight of
gold to Geelong. We spent Christmas of 1851 there, and soon after
that decided to go again to Ballarat, taking our
wives&mdash;Glenn and I&mdash;and families with
us&mdash;seventeen in all. Three inches of snow fell in Ballarat
on our arrival, and we were hardly landed on the Eureka when up
came a commissioner and a trooper and demanded our grog; we had
ten gallons of brandy, and had to give it up, and we had got it
at the post office below, but we did not tell where we got it,
though the commissioner knew, for the bullock driver, we
believed, had told him. The trooper wanted a digger to assist him
with the grog; "if you do," said I, "I'll smash your head", so
the digger gave no assistance. Next day the commissioner came
back to my mate, and got him to take the keg to the camp. We paid
the post office man £1 a gallon for the grog, and he gave us back
the £10. We started digging on the Eureka, near where the
stockade was afterwards. One day, when the troopers were license
hunting, I saw Thomas Maher get into a hollow log to escape the
troopers; when he got in he found a snake there four feet long;
it went to one end of the log, and Maher remained till the
troopers went away. The diggers were wearied out of their lives
by the troopers. They were tormented everywhere. Our party from
first to last on the diggings must have paid about £500 in
license fees.</blockquote>

<br>
<p>Shannahan, who is now 86 years of age, may be pardoned if his
memory is not exact as to the number of pounds. His notion of the
"tormenting" troopers is honestly Hibernian, and was thoroughly
characteristic in one who began his narration to the
<i>Courier</i> interviewer with the words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>No, it was not the gold discovery that brought me
out. In Corrigeen, Barony of Kilmarney, where I lived, seventeen
houses were burnt in one day by way of eviction. I at once made
up my mind to be under Parker, our landlord, no longer, and I
came out here.</blockquote>
<p>The ever recurring wail of the Saxon-hating Irish Celt was
thus most naturally echoed by Shannahan as soon as he found the
inconvenient officers of the law crossing his path in this new
land. Shannahan had a store within the Stockade, and there the
declaration of independence, mentioned in a subsequent chapter,
was drawn up.</p>
<p>On the 28th of August, among others who arrived at Buninyong,
were Messrs. James Oddie, Thomas Bath, Francis Herring, and
George Howe, and they reached Golden Point on Monday, the 1st
September. The news quickly got to Geelong, and on the 9th a good
many people, including ministers of religion, doctors, merchants,
and others, arrived. On the day following, the Clunes prospectors
having heard of the richer discoveries, Esmond, Cavenagh, and
others arrived from Clunes, and Esmond and Cavenagh found fifty
pounds weight of gold in two days, that being the first sent down
by escort, and Cavenagh being the first to send goid to England,
where it realised £4 per oz. The sketch map of Golden Point, by
A.C. M'Donald, as the place was when the first rush was just
reaching there, gives us a fairly accurate picture of the ground
as it was then occupied. M'Donald was one of the diggers there,
and Mr. Oddie vouches for the validity of the plan. He informs us
that his tent was close to Cavanagh's claim, and his claim was
down the slope towards the creek. Seeing how rich Cavanagh's
claim was, and that Oddie's tent was not on the claim held by
Oddie's party, Howe and Herring&mdash;probably the first
practitioners in a line of business that in after years became an
art&mdash;jumped Oddie's tent ground, a space twelve feet by
fourteen, or thereabout, and took 37 lbs. weight of gold out of
the ground. The following extracts from Mr. M'Donald's diary of
the time throw additional light upon the aspect of affairs then,
and prove that snow in summer was near being a fact in this
elevated region that year.</p>
<blockquote>6/10/51. Left Geelong in company with A.V. Suter (now
residing at Yambuck Station, near Portland, Victoria), William
Fisher, (then of Barrabool Hills, farmer); Percy E. Champion (of
Geelong, now deceased). 9/10/51. Arrived at Golden Point,
Ballarat. 11/10/51. A considerable fall of snow to-day.
Snow-balling freely indulged in. Population estimated at about
1000 to 1200. Sly grog-selling carried on openly, several
prominent Melbourne and Geelong storekeepers subsequently fined.
Meetings were held and two orderly and respectable diggers did
their best to put down sly grog-selling and partially succeeded
in doing so. 26/10/51. The postal arrangements at this time were
very insufficient; a bi-weekly mail from Melbourne and Geelong
served for a population of about 10,000 diggers. I frequently
walked to Buninyong and received letters there that should have
been sent on to Ballarat. 2/11/51. About this time a stampede set
in for Mount Alexander and in less than a week Golden Point was
almost deserted; many diggers returned to Geelong and reported
that the field was worked out. Weather bitterly cold and wet,
hail and sleet and a little snow fell to-day. The Yarrowee and
Gnarr Creek were, when I arrived on the field, clear running
streams, the former 3 to 4 yards wide, with wide grassy black
alluvial flats. Black Hill heavily timbered to its summit and not
a pick had been put in anywhere on the western side of the
Yarrowee stream. The diggers worked their claims very carelessly
and accidents resulted by the caving in of the sides; a few
deaths also resulted. One party took up a claim at the foot of a
large tree, and found a considerable quantity of gold amongst its
roots; the tree was under-mined and fell, killing one of the
party and injuring another. The police hunted the diggers, and
any miner found searching for gold without a license was taken to
the commissioners' camp. I have seen three men chained to a tree
all night because they could not, or would not, pay the 30s. per
month. About the end of October, two men were shot at for
stealing gold, or rather washdirt. They were not mortally
wounded, however, and were allowed to escape.</blockquote>
<p>On the 19th of September Mr. Commissioner Doveton, and
Assistant-Commissioner Armstrong arrived with troopers, and on
the 20th the first license was issued, Connor's party being the
first licensees, and paying 15s. each for the remainder of the
month. The diggers did not relish the demand of license fees, and
at a meeting held&mdash;Connor on the stump&mdash;the division
was against paying the fees. But the decision was not adhered to
in practice, for the licenses were taken out immediately. Turner,
for his party, followed Connor's example quickly, for by that
time jealousies of each other had arisen, the Clunes contingent
being regarded with especial disfavor. Swindells, one of the
Geelong diggers, mounted the stump in those early days and on one
occasion he got the diggers to divide&mdash;Clunes v.
Geelong&mdash;and the balance of power being seen to be on the
side of the latter, and the presence of the authorities aiding
also, peace was kept. For the attitude of the Commissioners was
firm. When Swindells and Oddie, as the chosen delegates of the
diggers, waited on the Commissioners to oppose the issue of the
licenses. Commissioner Doveton said to them:&mdash;"I am not come
to make the law, but to administer it, and if you don't pay the
license fee I'll damned soon make you pay it." This was nervously
epigrammatic, and being fortified by a very contiguous group of
black troopers, was practically irresistible. No wonder, then,
that the peace, in that direction also, was kept. But that little
drama in the tent of the Commissioners was a kind of prophetic
rehearsal. The dialogue had in it pent-up elements which, not
many years after, exploded in tragical fashion. But we must not
here forestall the evolution of events.</p>
<p>The diggings were shallow and very productive, the rains were
heavy, and two rude bridges erected, the first probably, over the
Yarrowee by Connor's party, were washed away. By the time the
first week was over there had gathered near 100 diggers at the
Point, the riches unearthed there quickly attracting not only all
the other prospectors, but setting the colony on fire with
excitement from end to end. The quiet Ballarat sheep run, with
its grassy slopes and shadowy glades, and its green-galley where
the Yarrowee poured its limpid waters, became suddenly
transformed as by the wand of an enchanter. The Black Hill then
looked upon the valley with a densely timbered head and face,
whence its name was taken. The valley was thinly sprinkled with
trees, and the ranges, with the spurs subsequently known as
Golden Point, Bakery, Specimen, and Sinclair's Hills, were well
timbered, while the western basaltic table land, where Western
Ballarat is now, was moderately sprinkled with the usual variety
of forest growth. In a brief time all this was changed. Soon the
solitary blue columns of smoke that rose from the first
prospecting parties' camping places were but undistinguishable
items amidst a host. The one or two white tents of the
prospectors were soon lost in crowded irregular lines and groups
of tents that dotted the slopes and flats, or spread out along
the tortuous tracks made by the bullock teams of the squatter.
The axe of the digger quickly made inroads upon the forest all
round; the green banks of the Yarrowee were lined with tubs and
cradles, its clear waters were changed to liquid, yellow as the
yellowest Tiber flood, and its banks grew to be long shoals of
tailings. Everywhere little hillocks of red, yellow, and white
earth were visible as the diggers got to work, and in a few weeks
the green slopes, where the prospectors found the gold of Golden
Point, changed from their aboriginal condition to the appearance
of a fresh and rudely made burial ground. At first the upturned
colored earth-heaps were but as isolated pustules upon the fair
face of the primeval hills and valley, but they rapidly
multiplied until they ran together, so to speak, and made the
forest swards but so many blotched reaches of industrious
disorder, the very feculence of golden fever everywhere in
colored splotches with shadowed pits between.</p>
<p>Mr. Latrobe, in a despatch at this date to Earl Grey,
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>It is quite impossible for me to describe to your
lordship the effect which these discoveries have had upon the
whole community. Within the last three weeks the towns of
Melbourne and Geelong and their large suburbs have been in
appearance almost emptied of many classes of their male
inhabitants. Not only have the idlers to be found in every
community, and day laborers in town and the adjacent country,
shopmen, artisans, and mechanics of every description thrown up
their employments&mdash;in most cases leaving their employers and
their wives and families to take care of themselves&mdash;and run
off to the workings, but responsible tradesmen, farmers, clerks
of every grade, and not a few of the superior classes have
followed; some, unable to withstand the mania and force of the
stream, but others because they were, as employers of labor, left
in the lurch, and had no other alternative. Cottages are
deserted, houses to let, business is at a standstill, and even
schools are closed. In some of the suburbs not a man is left, and
the women are known, for self-protection, to forget neighbors'
jars, and to group together to keep house. The ships in the
harbor are in a great measure deserted, and masters of vessels,
like farmers, have made up parties with their men to go shares at
the diggings. Both here and at Geelong all buildings and contract
works, public and private, are at a stand-still.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Westgarth, in his "Victoria in 1857",. thus refers to what
he saw of change in Melbourne when he returned from a visit to
Europe:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>All had been changed into a wild and tumultuous
development. The waters of Hobson's Bay were scarcely visible
beneath a forest of five or six hundred vessels. The grassy
glades of North Melbourne were now a hard and dusty surface, cut
up everywhere with roads, and disturbed with the incessant noise
of the traffic to the interior.</blockquote>
<p>To extricate the deserted ships it was proposed to get Lascars
from India. Communication with the mother country was only
possible haphazard in those days. The Victorian Governor's
despatches took six, and, in one instance, seven months to reach
London. His Excellency and all his following were perplexed by
the whirlwind of auriferous excitement. As his despatches stated,
all classes felt the burning thirst for gold. Sir J. Palmer, at
that time President of the Legislative Council, was one of the
first diggers at Golden Point, and used to quarter at Lal Lal.
Among the first visitors were Lady A'Beckett, wife of the Chief
Justice, with other ladies and gentlemen, who made a pilgrimage
from Melbourne in a waggonette to see the new wonders. The
Governor, too, came upon the scene. Clunes and Anderson's Creek
had mildly aroused the authorities in Melbourne, and regulations
to be enforced by the 1st of September were discussed for those
places; "but (writes the Governor to Earl Grey) before this could
be done, they also were deserted, not from any real
unproductiveness, but from the discovery of the new gold-field
within a mile of the township of Buninyong." This was the
Hiscock's Gully ground, but that electric flash was speedily
followed by the more brilliant discharges from Golden Point,
"another locality (to cite the Governor's despatches again)
producing the precious metal in far greater abundance in the
valley of the River Leigh, about seven miles to the northward,
into which a very large conflux of adventurers is pouring." Under
these circumstances the Government bestirred itself, sent up
police, promulgated the right of the Crown in the gold, issued
licenses, and so took the first feeble steps in the portentous
and sometimes wayward path of gold-fields government. The Golden
Point diggers did not like the licenses at first, but they soon
took kindly to them, and 400 were issued within a few days. His
Excellency, writing on 10th October, stated that 1300 had been
issued, and by the 30th October, 2246. He saw the lucky diggers
digging up the gold on the Point, and told Earl Grey there were
500 cradles at work, not fewer than 2500 persons on the ground,
and 500 arriving daily. He saw 8 lbs. of gold washed from two tin
dishes of dirt, heard of a party that raised 16 lbs. at an early
hour, and 31 lbs. in all that day, many parties of four sharing
day after day 10 oz. per man. "There can be no doubt (continues
his Excellency) but that gold must rank as one of the most
important, if not the most important, products of the colony, and
that from this time forward a very considerable and valuable
section of the population will be employed in realising it."</p>
<p>The Victorian Governor's foresight was true, for he was
sagacious and the times were quickening. He and his Ministers had
only just begun to draw breath again after the Ballarat rush, had
begun to discuss the propriety of raising the salaries of civil
servants to meet the new state; of affairs, had noted "business
beginning to receive as many, physically and morally unfit for
the austerities of the gold-fields returned to their homes," when
a second shock came to fright them from their re-assuring
propriety. The Mount Alexander diggings "broke out", as the
expressive phrase had it, and the Governor once more took to
horse and went to see the newer Eldorado, writing on 30th October
to Earl Grey, and telling him "On my return to Melbourne the
whole population was again excited."</p>
<p>The Mount Alexander rush was caused by a shepherd picking up a
bit of golden quartz. That led to prospecting, and a party haying
got £300 worth of gold in a seam of quartz, more prospectors
arrived, and then the rich alluvial grounds were opened, and
Ballarat itself was half deserted by rushers to the later held,
and everything was turned topsy-turvy once more. Poor Mr. Latrobe
at last got excited in his syntax. Writing on 3rd December to
Earl Grey, his Excellency said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I must now apprise you that the progress and results
of the successful search for gold in this (Mount Alexander)
quarter, in the short interval which has since elapsed, has been
such as completely to disorganise the whole structure of society,
and it really becomes a question how the more sober operations of
society, and even the functions of government, may be carried
on.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Hastie, writing recently to the author, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>At the beginning of the diggings little attention was
paid to Sabbath religious worship, the feelings of many
resembling those of the digger who, when asked for a
subscription, sent for a bottle of brandy to treat his visitor
with. For the brandy the digger paid nine shillings, and as the
subscription sought was only five shillings, his refusal cost
more than his consent would have cost. After a while, however,
open shops on the Sabbath were shut, the diggings became dotted
with places of worship, and the Sabbath was observed with nearly
as much respect as at the present time. At the first, all sorts
of people came to the diggings, government officers, lawyers,
doctors, merchants, and others. Two friends spent a night with me
on their way to Ballarat; one was in the civil service with a
salary of £600 a year, the other a merchant in good business. I
expostulated with them, but they seemed determined to carry out
their purpose of throwing up office and business for gold
digging. Second thoughts must have induced them to change their
design, for the civil servant rose afterwards to the very highest
office in his department, and the merchant, after some years,
retired, and, as far as I know, is still (1886) living at home on
the estate he purchased. Among those who rushed to Ballarat were
several clergymen, and one asked that his horse might graze in my
paddock. I said a Church of England minister had been staying
with me for a fortnight, and if he came, like him, to preach to
and visit the diggers, I would be quite willing to keep his
horse, but if he came as a digger, I must charge him, as I had
not sufficient grass for my own stock, and was continually
pestered with similar applications. One day a digger asked me if
I would sell my vehicle, as he was going to Bendigo, and the trap
would suit him; I said I could not spare it, and he then offered
to take me as a mate. Humoring his whim for the moment, I pointed
out how little I could do; "Oh," says he, "we will make you cook,
and you will share alike in the gold." I declined, and perhaps
lost the chance of becoming one of the Sandhurst magnates, but I
do not regret the decision. Society, for a time, seemed to lose
its ordinary conditions; those at the bottom rose to the top, and
those at the top fell to the bottom; but it says much for the
intelligence and character of the diggers and others that this
state of things was so speedily righted, and that authority and
law so soon resumed their place. This was certainly not due to
the conduct or character of some of those in authority, young men
whose only title to office was their having the ear of the
Government, or of some one connected with the Government, for
there could not be one more just, upright, and anxious to promote
the interests of the colony than Mr. Latrobe. Many of his
inferior officers were indeed inferior. Many had come out with
recommendations from the home Government which Mr. Latrobe was
constrained to regard. Had he been left to act on his own
authority the disturbances which took place would never have
occurred.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Hastie's observations anticipate here the march of events
in this history, but they go to vindicate the reputation of an
honest officer, upon the heads of whose subordinates, appointed,
doubtless, in the manner stated, much of the trouble hereafter to
be recorded must be laid.</p>
<p>The Hon. David Ham, who was elected to the Legislative Council
on the 30th June, 1886, as one of the representatives for the
Wellington Province, tells the following story of his adventures
as a pioneer in the early days, from which it will be seen that
he was a wonderful man for being at the start of
things:&mdash;</p>

<span class="u">Ballarat Flat, from the Black
Hill&mdash;1855</span></p>
<br>
<blockquote>I landed in Melbourne on the 24th July, 1849, when
the wages paid for general servants was from £20 to £25 a year.
Having had contracts for the supply of stores to wool ships off
Point Henry, I became a farmer in 1850 at Bellarine, Indented
Heads, and was potato digging on the 6th July, when the fires of
Black Thursday were about us. We all left work and ran down into
the sea. Left Geelong on the 10th July, 1851, for the diggings at
Buninyong, no Ballarat being then discovered. Saw Hiscock and
party washing off dirt in a tin dish, swilling it through the
water, and then letting clear water on the dirt and fishing with
a knife for any specks of gold that could be seen through the
water in the dirt. Returned to Geelong and left there with stores
when Ballarat was discovered. T.C. Riddell, Robert Fawcett,
myself, and four others, reached Ballarat in September, as the
first license had just been issued. Pistols and powder were the
order of the day when work was over. We had a good claim on
Golden Point, and soon worked it out, and then on the 3rd
November, Alfred Douglass (senr.), W. Harper (Government
Officer), H. Butchers, and I, left for Fryer's Creek. Got there
on the 9th, our party being the fourth on the ground. We opened
up Golden Point and the Golden Gully, taking a loaded gun to
protect ourselves with, as old hands were prowling about for
chances to rob holes. Many a life was taken in those days and
never accounted for. The diggings were rich. I have seen 130 lbs.
weight of gold taken out of a crevice in the rock there. In
March, 1852, we had come to Ballarat again, and had a claim on
the creek below Golden Point, about 32 feet square, 10 feet deep,
and we took out £1200 worth of gold in two months. Then I, with
four others, sank the first hole in Canadian Gully, and found the
first nugget just below Hill and party, who were surfacing on the
top of the range. We were about the first to open the first gully
at Little Bendigo on the old Eureka. In May there came a flood
and ruined all the workings on the flats. From 1853 to 1854 I had
a butchery store on the Eureka, where the Orphan Asylum is now.
Sold out, went to Geelong, invested in house property there, but
people left for the gold-fields, property fell and I lost
everything but my reputation. Paid 20s. in the pound, and in 1857
went to Ararat diggings. In 1859 I and others put up a sawmill in
Monkey Gully, and opened up the Victoria Reef at Browns; and up
to 1863 was engaged opening up Smythesdale, Happy Valley, Cape
Clear, Bull Dog, and Linton. In 1868 I returned to Ballarat,
where I have remained ever since.</blockquote>
<p>The Ballarat excitement was exceeded by that of the Mount
Alexander rush, and the Governor informed Earl Grey that while
there were about 6000 persons at the Ballarat rush, there were
double that number in an area of 15 square miles at Mount
Alexander. His Excellency forthwith proposed to put a pecuniary
drag upon the wheels of this auriferous machine that was running
away with the bodies and wits of the population. He proposed to
double the license fee, as the Legislative Council would not
sanction a special vote to meet the new exigencies of the
Executive. A further ground for the proposal was, "the notorious
disproportion of the advantages derivable under the license
system to the public revenue, compared with the amount of private
gain." His Excellency also hoped by this means to deter unfit men
from going to the diggings&mdash;fond but delusive hope. The
superintendent of police and the sheriff furnished their
contributions to the bitter cup of the unhappy Governor,
informing him that most of the police and warders and turnkeys of
gaols had sent in their resignations. Nor was this all, for "many
clerks in the public service are bent on the same course." Then
the Governor applied to the Governor-General at Sydney for "an
increase to the small military force stationed here, sufficient,
I trust, happen what may, to place the gaols, stockades, and
banks for the present in safety." Mr. Latrobe wisely reminded
Earl Grey that the preservation of order was more important than
raising a great revenue, as thousands would flock to the colony,
but good colonists would stay away if law became impotent to
preserve peace and order. So he felt that he must have soldiers,
not fearing that they would desert like the sailors to follow the
seductive pursuit of gold. "Melbourne ought (wrote his
Excellency) to be made the head-quarters of one regiment at
least." In time this came about, and then, in less than two
decades, we had talked of getting rid of both soldiers and the
Home Government, and setting up absolutely for ourselves. The
soldiers are already gone, and all the British empire is
discussing the relations to be maintained between the parent
State and her world-encircling colonies.</p>
<p>This modern outcome, however, had not appeared to the
Government of 1851 as a probability. The Governor and his
subordinates were busy regulating and licensing and escorting the
diggers and their gold. "Boninyong", as the name was spelt in the
despatches, was the head-quarters of the local authorities then.
They issued a notice in October, having found that gold was
accumulating, that "the escort will leave Boninyong every Tuesday
morning at six o'clock; persons desirous of sending gold under
the security afforded by this conveyance are to take care that it
is forwarded to Boninyong not later than four o'clock p.m. of the
Monday. Escort charge of 1 per cent. on washed gold, to be
estimated at the rate of £3 per ounce, and on gold mixed with a
larger portion of stone at the rate of £2 10s. the ounce." The
Government authorities undertook no responsibility. Like the
squatters, or small settlers, they advertised a sort of
accommodation paddock on wheels, but took no responsibility. They
had to take gold-dust in payment for licenses, for coin was
scarce, and in the same month we find the Treasurer in Melbourne
advertising for tenders for the purchase of 1500 oz. of gold.</p>
<p>In December the Government doubled the license fee, making it
£3 per month, or £1 10s. if the license was taken out after the
15th of the month. And this for a claim eight feet square for one
man, or eight feet by sixteen for a party, and with a prohibition
against digging within half-a-mile of every side of a homestead.
Even these regulations were luxuries to be denied to civil
servants unless they could show that their resignation of office
had "not only been authorised, but was unattended with
embarrassment to the Government." To work this machinery on the
Ballarat, or "Boninyong", diggings there were gazetted in
October:&mdash;William Mair, commissioner, salary £300 a-year; D.
Armstrong, assistant-commissioner, salary £250; John Bell, clerk,
salary £100; Henry Smith, inspector of police, salary £150;
mounted and foot constables at 3s. and 2s. 9d. per diem
respectively; and native police at the magnificent pay of 1½d.
per diem. For the Mount Alexander diggings there were Messrs.
Doveton, Lydiard, Dana, and Eyre as commissioners, or police
officers; and, as clerk, Mr. W. Hogarth, afterwards for sometime
clerk of petty sessions in Ballarat.</p>
<p>The following table, showing the prices current at Ballarat,
has been compiled from official returns, and will show the
influence of the gold discovery on the value of the necessaries
of life:&mdash;</p>

<p>The returns for the Mount Alexander diggings were more
elaborate, as at the dates given that locality was the more
important. It is, however, presumable that similar rates ruled in
Ballarat for goods not included in the Ballarat table. The prices
at Mount Alexander in October, 1852, were similar where both
tables recite the same articles. We find that at Mount Alexander
some handicraftsmen got as much as 25s. per diem, oats were £3
per bushel, tobacco 10s. per lb.; while in Melbourne Wellington
boots were quoted at from 50s. to 60s. per pair for imported, and
from 75s. to 90s. for those made to order. The price of cartage
from Melbourne to the diggings was from £100 to £120 per ton;
hotel charges were from 50s. to 140s. per week, and a horse at
livery cost 15s. a day, or 105s. a week. And it must be
remembered that these prices were paid for the roughest and
rudest accommodation and service, while the qualities of goods
could never in those days be very closely or, at least,
profitably scrutinised.</p>
<p>From some accounts and papers placed by Mr. Thomas Bath in the
author's hands, the proofs are given that up to the end of 1854
and the beginning of 1855, there had not been any great reduction
in prices. The coach fare from Geelong was still £3; "Mrs. Lynn
and nine children" paying £20. At that time Mr. Bath had some men
sawing for him the native timber then growing contiguous to a
sawpit in the Gnarr Creek gully, between Doveton and Armstrong
streets, where the railway reserve and wood merchants now are.
For flooring boards, the price was 38s. per 100 feet; and
quartering, or 4 inches by 3 inches, 33s. per 100 feet. Flour was
£6 10s. per bag; potatoes, 4¾d. per lb.; eggs, 6s. per dozen;
milk, 3s. per quart; peas, in husk, 1s. 3d. per quart; ginger
beer, 4s. per dozen; lemonade and soda water, 5s. per dozen;
oats, 16s. 3d. per bushel; hay, £25 per ton. A blacksmith's bill
charges 24s. for shoeing a horse, a single shoe being paid for at
the same rate. For a crowbar weighing 26 lbs., the price was
32s., and 30s. for tireing wheels, but how many is not stated,
though 2s. is the price for one linch pin, 3s. for a maul ring,
and 5s. for "one new axe;" not very exorbitant charges these
last, surely, for the times. From the same heap of old papers it
is found that £1 was the rent for two sittings from 1st January
to 31st March, 1856, in the little wooden building in Armstrong
street, which served then for Anglican church purposes. Some
weighbridge notes for August, 1856, also are evidence of Mr.
Bath's priority in that way; the first bridge in Ballarat having
been erected by him in what is now Bath street, and about midway
between Lydiard and Armstrong streets. One of the best-kept
documents in the series now before the author carries us back to
the days immediately after the Eureka Stockade
affair,&mdash;mentioned further on&mdash;and to the days
preceding the foundation of the District Hospital. It is as

<div>U R I N G the three years which passed between the December,
1851,&mdash;when the license fee was raised from thirty shillings
to sixty shillings a month,&mdash;and the December, 1854, when a
rebel flag was hoisted at the Stockade, the changes here had been
vast and various. There had been ebbings and flowings of
population between Ballarat and Mount Alexander and other more
newly opened gold-fields, and the golden note which Hargreaves
had struck in New South Wales and Esmond in Victoria had been
heard all over the world. From every country under heaven there
flocked to these shores men&mdash;young and wifeless men for tin;
most part&mdash;eager to engage in the hunt for gold and fortune.
Thousands upon thousands came from Europe, Asia, Africa, and
America, a mingled motley host that swarmed upon the greater
centres of gold-digging enterprise, prospected for new grounds,
or lingered upon the seaside to swell the urban populations.
These gathering hosts rapidly pushed forward the work of
exploration. Slope and flat and gully and hill-top were
successively invested by the army of old-comers and new-comers,
before whose resistless march the forest gradually fell, streets
of canvas and shingles sprang into being, and thus, where but a
little time before the forest was thick, and bird and beast were
undisturbed, gold-seeking became a wide-spread and permanent
industry. In February, 1853, the White Flat was rushed, and
before that time the upper part of Canadian Gully was opened.
Sailors' Gully was opened early in 1853, and Mr. James Vallins,
one of the oldest of the Ballarat diggers, writes to us as
follows, on the part of John Sawyer, who prospected Sailors'
Gully:&mdash;</div>
<br>
<blockquote>About the middle of 1853 myself and seven others
commenced prospecting. We were six sailors out of eight, and were
called "the sailors". The gully was called Sailors' Gully after
us. Swift and party, Americans, commenced prospecting Prince
Regent's Gully about the same time. We obtained a double claim,
48 ft. by 24 ft., as a prospecting claim. We were the first I
could discover to slab the shaft from surface to the bottom, the
practice being to sink a round shaft as far as the ground would
stand, then square and slab the rest. Our first shaft was lost in
the drift at about 70 feet from the surface. This was the first
drift with heavy water touched on Ballarat. The second shaft was
lost in the drift at 90 feet from the surface. This caused the
whole ground to be rushed both above and below our ground. Our
third shaft we succeeded in bottoming at 107 feet&mdash;then the
deepest hole on Ballarat&mdash;dead on the gutter. The water was
very heavy, and we were obliged to use two buckets, one up and
the other down, for the first time on Ballarat. We had to send to
Geelong and get made to order two water-buckets. The first gold
got was a nugget weighing 2½ oz. weight, sent up in the
water-bucket. The largest piece of gold got from the claim was
100 oz. Hundreds of people came to see us every day, and as we
were very hard worked we had to post a notice for them to read,
instead of asking questions:&mdash;"Notice.&mdash;Bottomed at 107
feet. Large quantity of water. Got a nugget."</blockquote>
<p>The Black Hill was, early in 1853, busily occupied, and the
ground between that and Rotten Gully&mdash;the head of the Eureka
Lead&mdash;was being taken up, the Eureka, so named by a medical
man, being opened in August, 1852. During the next year or two
the shallow grounds declined in importance, occasional
discoveries of new reaches of such ground not sufficing to keep
back the gradually growing importance of the deeper sinking on
the Canadian, Gravel Pits, Eureka, and other golden gutters.
Creswick was rushed in December, 1852, and ground down the Leigh
and at Smythesdale was gradually opened thereafter. In Ballarat
the population was located principally, indeed almost entirely,
on the ground now traversed by the present streets of the eastern
borough and along the lines of leads now built over, covered with
gardens and yards, crossed by streets, or still lying outside the
clustering houses and on the edges of the mingling boundaries of
borough and bush.</p>

<br>
<p>The new chum digger of 1852 writes to the author of 1886 as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I and my mate, whose very name I have forgotten,
pitched our tent on the slope near the Black Hill, where Humffray
street is now. That was in November, 1852. We had come up from
Melbourne with near a score of shipmates just landed from South
Africa. One of them, a Londoner, had an umbrella-shaped tent, the
rigging of which was a work of dexterity, and was watched with
interest. Close by, a party of four or five Scotchmen settled
down with more resolute intent, for they built sod walls for
their tent cover to sprawl over, and a sod lum, as they called
their chimney. Some of our shipmates had no money nor any
inclination to hard work, so they accepted billets as policemen
at the Camp. They and others of the force then were a ragged
ununiformed Falstaffian sort of crowd, with arms to match. I well
remember climbing the green mound to the group of tents called
the Camp, where I paid for my license, and where Camp street and
its close packed neighbourhood is now. There were not many
diggers at Golden Point. The Canadian we did not visit, but on a
Sunday we explored Rotten Gully, at the head of what became the
Eureka, and found the gully well occupied and well deserving its
name, for it was very rotten sinking. We dug shallow holes in the
Black Hill flat, but got "the color" only, and early in December
the rush to Creswick broke out and we went there. Pitched our
tent on the sward among the trees not far from a creek, but what
creek it was or is I do not now know and could not find again if
my life depended upon it. We were again unlucky, fell out,
separated, and I returned to Ballarat on my way to Melbourne,
disgusted with gold-hunting and bush-life, and determined to rush
back to civilisation, as fur as the thing was reachable then in
Melbourne. I found and left "Creswicks", as it was called then, a
mere collection of tents in the bush, and never saw it again till
it had grown into a little town, had been nearly all burnt down
and rebuilt. Ballarat was also a mere collection of tents, and a
few slightly more substantial dwellings, and all was on the
eastern side of the Yarrowee, save a few diggers' tents to the
west and the Camp group on the edge of the table land. I found
some of our shipmates employed making a dam across the Gnarr
Creek, near where the buried culvert now winds round beneath the
hill on which the locomotive engine-sheds are. On the slope from
what is now Hill street to what is now the artificially raised
Mair street, our old ship's "Doctor" had his shed and stoves and
what not, where, as Camp cook, he prepared the liberal meals
required by the healthy digestions of the people of all grades at
the Camp. It was a torrid day towards the end of December when I
humped my swag from "Creswicks" to Ballarat, and it was absolute
luxury to have a bunk allotted to me in the police quarters
amongst my old South African schooner mates. Next morning early I
rose to start for Melbourne, the old "doctor" (long since laid in
the old cemetery in Ballarat) was making a damper about four feet
in circumference, and he had coffee bubbling in a big boiler, and
mutton chops sputtering in an enormous fryingpan with a handle
some three or four feet long. He hospitably commended to my lips
the chalice of boiling coffee and heaps of chops and damper at
pleasure. I ate, as a fool eats, who has an appetite and does not
know how the midsummer heats of the day before and the day then
dawning were to affect him in conjunction with hot coffee, hot
chops, hot damper, and the tax of unwonted exertion upon the
energies and endurance of the body. Another Melbourne-bound
swagsman passed as I bade the Camp cook farewell, and we marched
on together. There was a rapid kind of freemasonry extant in
those days between some chance acquaintances, and so this passing
swagman and I trudged on in company, but I had not reached
Warrenheip before I found the pains and prostration of incipient
dysentery were upon me. I could only drag along slowly, and never
having been ill in my life before&mdash;nor since for that
matter&mdash;I was frightened. Seeing an empty woolshed, or
something, before we reached Ballan I said to my companion: "Go
on, and leave me here, for I can't go any further now." In sooth
I thought I was going to die. Perhaps he did too, and thought
also that he had better not be hindered, so, prudent man as he
was, he vanished for ever. I never knew his name, nor whence he
came, nor whither he went. Crawled on by nightfall to Ballan and
got a bed at the hotel there, but the landlord was also a prudent
man. I lay in agony all night, and in the morning he came to me
and said: "Get out o' this&mdash;we don't want any sick men
here." There was no answer to so masterful and, indeed,
irresistible a command as that, and I got out. Just able to walk,
and my light swag a burden, I was glad to see a dray with some
diggers, apparently returning to Melbourne, and I asked for a
lift. This they refused, but offered to carry my swag for me and
leave it at the hotel at Bacchus Marsh. I confidingly, and
gladly, and gratefully gave them the swag, and they were soon out
of sight round a bend in the road. By the time I had reached
round the bend they were invisible, but on the road I found the
bag in which I had carried my belongings, a change of clothes,
some papers and other trifles. Everything of the least usable
value had been stolen, and I sadly gathered up the poor remainder
and went on to Bacchus Marsh. But I had by this time got out of
the goldfields region by a good distance, and what after that
befell me does not belong to this motley history.</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Mr. Latrobe, writing to Earl Grey on the 2nd March, 1852, said
the population at Golden Point and "the outworks at Brown Hill"
had "dwindled rapidly down to 200 steady licensed workers,"
averaging not more "than eight or ten ounces per man monthly." In
the same despatch, however, his Excellency is pleased to express
a belief&mdash;strengthened by the fact that the population had
just then begun to increase and reached "500 and
upwards"&mdash;that when rain should come more people also would
come, "and that it will be found that the 'Ballarat Goldfield' is
far from being exhausted." His Excellency was, as we know, a good
prophet. He was not always as accurate in his geography, for in a
despatch dated 8th July, 1852, he informs Earl Grey that "a new
working, called the 'Eureka', nine miles from Ballarat proper, as
well as two or three others, were discovered in the month of
May." In the Governor's view of the gold-field population there
seems to have been not only a spirit of faith in the people, but,
as became the son of the old Moravian missioner, of devotion
towards God. In the despatch last cited, his Excellency
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>On all hands it must be considered that the
population at the workings, taken as a whole, are as orderly and
well disposed as can be met with in any part of the colony. The
comparative rarity of instances of grave outrage or of capital
crime is a subject of great gratitude to God.</blockquote>
<p>On the same day, in another despatch, the Governor adverts to
the state of the Government and the exigencies of the new order
of things, and again says his feeling is "that of thankfulness to
God that so much has been achieved" in the way of preserving
order. His Excellency over and over again bears testimony to the
general good order maintained by the mining population, and that,
too, "notwithstanding the extraordinary circumstances under which
the multitude finds itself brought together, the passions and
temptations of the hour, and the acknowledged insufficiency of
the police to oppose physical force to any really serious
outbreak or general disturbance." And when that which the
Governor hinted at as possible had really become a fact, the
<i>Argus</i> correspondent, writing from Ballarat on the 13th
November, 1854, bears the following testimony to the good manners
of the diggers on Sundays even in those exciting
times:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>These Ballarat diggers are most extraordinary rebels.
It struck nie to remark particularly, and to enquire as to their
conduct and observance of the Sabbath. Truly they have few
advantages, precious little of the gospel offered to them, little
either of education given; no wonder, indeed, if they were
vagabonds. But, as far as I could hear or see, the greatest
possible order and sobriety, the utmost observance possible, I
may say, of the Sabbath, has characterised their proceedings.
Clean and neat in their diggers' best costume, they promenade
over these vast gold-fields, their wives and children in their
best frocks too; but anything more calm or becoming or regardful
of the day could hardly be witnessed in the best towns of even
Christian Britain. How delightful would it not be to rule such
men well?</blockquote>
<p>True, most truly, indeed! But the writer need not have
wondered if he had known that the great bulk of the population
were of the best men of the "best towns of Christian Britain",
men of invincible spirit, as well as of moral and law-abiding
principles.</p>
<p>His Excellency's next despatch, dated the 31st July, 1852,
enclosed a petition from the Legislative Council to the Queen,
praying the establishment of a mint in Victoria, as "one of the
richest gold-fields in the world." We have now, but when this
history first appeared, had not yet got a mint any more than a
law to legalise mining on private property, also petitioned for a
year or two after the date last given. The Corporation of
Melbourne backed up the Legislative Council's petition for a
mint, but the Ballarat petition of 1855, for a private property
law, fell then, as through many succeeding years, upon an
unsympathising Parliament and a careless metropolis. It is a
coincidence worth noting, that the Melbourne corporation's
petition for a mint was signed by Mr. J.T. Smith, who had about
that time begun his long series of mayorships of Melbourne, and
who subsequently became Minister of Mines.</p>
<p>The following table, compiled from various sources, including
the compiler's own knowledge of several items, will give, as it
were, a bird's-eye view of the opening of the several portions of
the Ballarat field during the period ending December,
1854:&mdash;</p>

<p>Excepting the Dead Horse Gullies all the Ballarat proper leads
mentioned in the table above came from the eastern side of the
ranges into the Ballarat basin. In the year 1855 the western side
gave out the Golden Point, Nightingale, Malakoff, Redan,
Whitehorse, Frenchman's, and Cobbler's leads, all of which flowed
under the basaltic plateau of western Ballarat and Sebastopol.
The Golden Point was the name given to the earlier confluent
streams as they issued from Eastern Ballarat in one lead and
passed under the plateau, and into that lead all the others
flowed that had come down from the western side of the range.</p>
<p>The Ballarat township, now the City of Ballarat, was
proclaimed towards the middle of the year 1852, the first sales
of land being held in Geelong, Thomas Bath, now of Ceres Farm,
Learmonth, being the first purchaser for business occupation.
This was in November, 1852. The land obtained by Mr. Bath was
bought at the second sale, and consisted of portions of sections
1 and 2. Cobb's corner and the present town-hall site were sold
at the same time, and were bought by Robt. Reeves, on which,
subsequently, he forfeited his deposit. In the following year the
land was put up again, and the corner was bought by Mr. Bath for
£250. The next lot, that now occupied by the Town-hall and
District Court, was bought on the same day by P.W. Welsh, for
£202, and the deposit on that lot was again forfeited. In the
Appendix A will be found reports of the first land sales in
Ballarat West and East.</p>
<p>Mr. Bath built the first hotel in Ballarat, when all the
Government dwellings were of canvas, or of slabs with bark roofs.
It was erected in May, 1853, and licensed in the following month.
At that time there was no other hotel between Buninyong and
Lexton. But near the corner of Dana and Lydiard streets, now
occupied by Holmes and Salter's law offices, a tent or hut was
kept by one Meek, who wrote pen-and-ink sketches of "Victoria.
Meek, as became his name, did not make his business very
prominent from a licensing point of view, and his establishment,
by way of irony upon it or the police, used to be called "The
Trooper's Arms". The hotel built by Mr. Bath in May, 1853, was of
wood, in one storey, and is now a private dwelling on Soldiers'
Hill, the site of the original hotel being now occupied by the
permanent portion of the hotel now known as Craig's Royal hotel.
The wood for the first hotel was all brought from Geelong. The
two-storey portion yet remaining was begun at the end of 1853,
and finished in 1854. The clock now (1870) in the wooden tower
was then placed there, and was the first public clock in
Ballarat. Mr. Biddle, of Biddle's Saw-mills, supplied the
hardwood for the building, the longer timbers having been cut in
the hollow called the Crater on the western slope of Mount
Buninyong. He says he also suggested the placing of the public
clock in the tower. Mr Bath tells us that the cost of both
buildings was enormous, for prices alike of material and transit
were then excessive. He paid £80 per ton carriage from Geelong,
40s. to 45s. per hundred feet at the pit for hardwood, as the
indigenous forest timber is called, and £1 per hundred feet
cartage from the saw-pits to Ballarat. Mr. Bath, in a letter to
us, gives the following additional recollections:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The roads in those days were frightful. I have had
goods on the road from Geelong above five weeks. Mrs. Bath came
from Geelong by, I suppose, the first coach, and was three days
and two nights on the road. Watt ran a conveyance from Ballarat
to Melbourne via Bacchus Marsh, stopping there one night, fare
£7. When I built in Ballarat there were not many hotels between
Geelong and this&mdash;two at Batesford, then the Separation Inn,
then Watson's, at Meredith, and Jamieson's and Sellick's, at
Buninyong. I have often ridden from Ballarat to Geelong without
seeing a fence or meeting any person, but at those times I kept
off the track. I purchased a stack of hay in 1853 from Mr. Darlot
at the station at Sebastopol at £60 per ton, and I had to truss
and cart it in the bargain, and this was hay of a self-sown crop
and about half of it silver grass [While we copy this, (1870)
oaten hay in truss is sold in the Ballarat market at £2 10s. per
ton.] I purchased oats in Geelong in 1850 at 2s. per bushel, and
at Bendigo in 1852 at £3 per bushel. Some of the farming land in
this district was sold in June, 1854, and I then commenced
farming, cropping about fifty acres the first
season.</blockquote>
<p>On the 8th December, 1856, the first sale of frontages in
Ballarat East commenced. The sale had been preceded by much
excitement relative to an absurd proclamation prohibiting the
issue of licenses, or the carrying on of business within one mile
of sold lands. After some agitation that ukase was withdrawn by
the Government. The sales of the Main road frontages were
continued for four consecutive days, and land now of little value
then realised enormous prices. To return to 1852, we note that
Mr. Adams, late of Buninyong, had a store at the head of Golden
Point, and he used to act as postmaster and convey letters from
the diggings to the township of Buninyong, his store giving the
name to the hill now known as Old Post-office Hill, where also
the first Government Camp was situated, whence it was removed to
the present locality. Mr. Alfred Clarke, late of the <i>Geelong
Advertiser</i>, acted as letter-carrier between Geelong and
Buninyong in 1851. The first supply of stores to the early
diggers was afforded by one Stirling's hawking dray, in October,
1851, and the first regular store was shortly after that opened
by Mr. Robinson, subsequently a member of the first town council
of Geelong. Stirling and Sons' drays were the only conveyances at
that time for either passengers or goods between Ballarat and
Geelong. Stores, like dwellings, were rude, and often the
storekeeper, like the digger, was surly. From his tent of calico
or canvas, with its furniture of blankets, frying-pan, cradle,
puddling-tub, pick and shovel, the digger went to the store where
mutton, flour, boots, serge-shirts, moleskin trousers, tobacco,
sardines, sugar, picks, shovels, billies, and other things were
all found in one grand miscellany. Coin was rare, and the digger
generally bartered his gold-dust for goods. Change there was
none, and reckonings partook of the largeness of view which
ignored minute calculations. Paper was scarce, and often the
digger had to carry his groceries to his tent in box, billy,
handkerchief, or shirt. The life was rough but eventful, not to
say jolly, and as long as gold was got the digger was generally
happy. If his pocket grew light and the authorities demanded
license fees, he had to wash dirt enough to supply the required
gold; but if he failed in his search, or, worst of all, if health
failed, he was of all men most miserable. There were no hospitals
or asylums in that early day, and a woman was an absolute
phenomenon; so the sick man often died with nothing civilised
about him but the awkward, if gentle, tending of his digging
partners in the gold-hunting wilderness. And some fell in utter
loneliness, their bones when found being buried beneath some
drooping spray of peppermint about the slopes or gullies of the
gold-field.</p>
<p>In those first days of digging life, when womanless crowds
wrestled with the earth and the forest amid much weariness and
solitude of heart, the arrival of a woman was the signal for a
cry and a gathering. The shout, "There's a woman!" emptied many a
tent of besoiled and hardy diggers, for the strange sight evoked
instant memories of far-away homes: of mothers, wives, and
sweethearts, and all the sweet affections and courtesies they
represented, and never with such eloquent emphasis as then. There
was no man, having the heart of a man, who did not bless the
vision, while many an eye was moistened with the sudden tear as
love, hope, disappointment, fear, struggled all at once in the
homeless digger's bosom. But recklessness often marked the life
of the time, and the brandy bottle of the grog-shanty killed some
victims then as it does in this later day. Unlicensed at first,
the grog-sellers got licensed afterwards, and did heavy trade
with the heavy drinker, the more moderate drinkers helping to
swell the business to a large and highly profitable aggregate.
Prices of all kinds of goods and all kinds of labor were
enormously high. One publican in 1853, when cartage from Geelong
was £80 per ton, paid £1500 a week for cartage for seven months
running. This one man had at one time no fewer than 122
public-houses or shanties either mortgaged to him or in his own
actual possession.</p>
<p>Mr. F.W. Tatham, manager of the Prince of Wales Company from
1862 to its winding up in 1875, gives an episode or two
illustrative of the times and the men of the fifties. He says,
referring to the mad, early, womanless days, that</p>
<blockquote>Brandy was the great panacea for too many. But
civilisation gradually dawned, and some congenial spirits now and
then met to discuss politics, theology, or other serious matters
in the tent on Sundays or evenings. There was one party
consisting of three doctors, a captain in the army, some sea
captains, and some American colonels and majors. Some of them are
dead, others scattered over the world, but some of them became
victims of alcohol. Joe N&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, our next tent
neighbour, a merry, bibulous sawmaker from Sheffield, had a young
wife. About a year after marriage she had to prepare for a
serious emergency, but had no means, for Joe swallowed
everything. My wife and other women promised to help her, and I
tried to get hold of Joe, but there was no getting him then into
a serious mood. At last, one Sunday morning, as the wife's time
uas drawing near, and things were dear and scarce, I got Joe to
look at the position. As soon as he realised it, he said he knew
where he could get some gold, and would soon set things right.
Next day he brought home a few pennyweights&mdash;enough to make
a start with. The next day he got several ounces, too late for
the intended service, as the young stranger had made an
appearance; but the ladies had cut up some of their own clothes,
and so the exigency was met. That was a year before the Eureka
affair. At another time Joe came to my tent one Sunday morning,
and we went exploring up by Black Hill, Dead Horse, and Rotten
Gully, afterwards called Little Bendigo. He was hard up, as
usual, and I had no money, for I did not expect to want any.
After an hour's travelling, Joe wanted to drink; I said we could
get a drink of tea at some tent. "Tea be blowed", said Joe. "But
we have no money, and the shanties don't give grog on credit."
"Oh, if you'll help," replied Joe, "that's all right." We looked
round among the shallow holes for some likely looking headings,
found a tin dish planted among some rubbish, scooped up half a
dish of dirt, and washed it off, getting a few grains. After
repeating the experiment three or four times, he succeeded in
getting nearly a pennyweight of gold, and, tying it up in a bit
of rag, he persuaded a German grog seller to let him have about a
quarter pint of brandy. That was in the mad times when men would
not wash dirt for less than an ounce to the tub, and nobody took
much notice of a man washing a bit of headings, even on a Sunday.
Poor Joe is long since dead. Some of the other and better
educated mob of professionals and naval and military men thought
of little else than where they could got brandy. They knew
something of chemistry, and I have heard them boast how, when all
their money and credit was gone, and, living far into the night
in a drug store, they, with the help of some pain-killer,
manufactured a palatable drink. One of the ladies who helped
Joe's wife was Mrs. Pincott, whose husband subsequently gave his
name to Pincott's dam. They lived close by our tent, and Mrs.
Pincott gave birth to a son, the first born on these diggings.
This was close to Brown Hill, and Pincott's mates were so pleased
that they took the hat round, and collected bits of gold from
some of the wash-dirt paddocks; some gave them small nuggets,
some gave wash-dirt, some money, altogether amounting to about
£80, and the lad was named Eureka. He lived and throve three or
four years, and then fell into a water hole. His mother found him
before he was dead, but, though she made frantic efforts to get
him out of the shallow hole, she could not reach him. Digging her
toes into the sides of the shaft, she kept the boy for a time out
of the water, but could not make her cries for help heard until
too late to save her child's life.</blockquote>

<span class="u">John Alloo's Chinese Restaurant, Main Road,
Ballaarat, 1853.</span></p>
<br>
<p>Mr. John Brooksbank, a hardworking Yorkshireman from Bradford,
who landed in Melbourne on the 20th June, 1848, and came to
Ballarat in September, 1851, favors the author with some
autobiographical notes&mdash;simple, graphic, almost reminiscent
of old Pepys in quaintness. He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>After a long and severe passage, and my money being a
little scarce, I had to be pretty smart and get work as soon as
possible. Got work in (Government employ, and soon after was
taking contracts, and during this time I bought a farm of the
Hon. John Pascoe Fawkner, near Melbourne. Went to Geelong in
right good times, everything going on first rate until the news
of the discovery of the gold. Then everything was upside down,
men would not work at any price, contracts broke, men and masters
going to the diggings. Jack was as good as his master. Never got
a penny for my work in Geelong, so I had to make my way to
Ballarat, which was in the month of September. Pitched my tent on
the Brown Hill road, now called Humffray street, and started to
sink; got a little, and at the end of November we left for Mount
Alexander, and was not long before we got gold. So I was there on
Xmas day and had a jolly fine plum pudding. My mate's wife used
to cook for us and rock the cradle, and got half share, and the
two seemed to keep their own purses
separate&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;On
our way to Melbourne I was gathering sticks to boil the billy and
picked up a roll of notes tied with a string. Not near our dray
at all, so I put them in my pocket and said nothing about them,
thinking they would say "we will divide them"; as I intended to
advertise them in Melbourne. But when we were on our way the
woman, to my surprise, said she had lost a roll of notes, so I
asked what the parcel was like. She said it was rolled up tight
and tied with a string so I knew at once it was the one I had
found, so I took it out of my pocket and showed it to her. The
husband said she ought to give me half. She got the notes and we
went on our way rejoicing. Got to Melbourne on Sunday, next day
started for Geelong, and at night was in the bosom of my family.
So I soon looked out and bought a horse and dray and took my
family to Ballarat, where we arrived after seven days with a good
horse, and we fixed our tent about the same place where I first
fixed when first I came up. Built one of the first restaurants on
Ballarat near where the Red Bull now stands. Meals were 4s. and
Sunday dinners 5s. and regular boarders £2 2s. per week. Was
obliged to keep a little grog, and soon after that a man came up
from Geelong, a friend of one of the boarders, so he asked him to
have a feed at his expense. So after having this feed he asked my
wife to let him have drink, as he was a friend of his it was all
right. So accordingly he got the drink, but to my horror and
surprise this noble Geelong friend of our boarder went straight
to the police camp and joined the force and came down and stuck
me up for grog selling, and I was fined £50. He was soon hooted
from pillow to post, and his effigy was burnt, and he was soon
banished from
Ballarat&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;The
little gingerbeer man shot at the stockade was a boarder of mine.
He was supposed to have shot Captain Wise on that memorable
occasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;About
7 o'clock on next evening a boy came running to tell me the
bushrangers were in their store, and were tieing the master and
mistress down. So myself and Mr. Smith and one or two others were
fully prepared with our shooting irons in good order, so over we
went and divided ourselves, some to the back and some to the
front. I took the back, and Cane, an old man-o'-war's man, was
with me, a wild sort of a man. So we got to the door pretty
quietly, and could see over the door how all things stood inside;
the pistols and the carving knives and cash box on the table, and
the ringleader was putting the money in his pockets while the
others were helping him. I had my horse pistol in my hand, and my
mate came with his revolver keeping them covered, and by this
time there was a double-barrelled gun there. So I dragged open
the door and took charge of the fire arms, and the other men
coming in at the front the bushrangers were secured without the
slightest show of escape. So we released the missus and master
and tied the would-be robbers in their place. When they were
tried they pleaded guilty and had 14 years on the roads, the
first three in irons. They were escapees from Pentridge. I had a
great trouble at this time, as one of my children died very
suddenly, and these trials were trials in those times. No one to
make a coffin, as one man volunteered to make one but when I
looked for the coffin he said he had clean forgot it; and two men
went to dig the grave and got bushed, so I had to go and dig it
myself. This is not very pleasant jobs lo do for your own
children. The ground was not fenced in at this time, as this was
amongst the first that was buried in the old burying ground
(cemetery by the Creswick road).</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Brooksbank tells other of his experiences, such as
building tins old Bank of Victoria&mdash;referred to further on,
diddling a party who had obtained a "wrongful" order for
restitution of wash dirt, erecting a pump on Yuille's Creek
between Webster street and Creswick road at which to sell water,
going two or three times to New Zealand, building a public house
at the corner of Lyons and Urquhart streets, then going mining
again with no luck and "the results of foul air and old age
creeping on I have determined as far as possible to leave the
mining on one side."</p>
<p>From Mr. Irwin's contributions to the <i>Ballarat Star</i>,
more expressly referred to in a subsequent chapter, we take the
following as confirmatory of some foregoing remarks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>During the earlier days of the rush to Golden Point a
monetary arrangement existed which would scarcely be long
tolerated now-a-days. It was this, when the purchaser went to a
store for supplies he got as change either a Burnbank, Colac or
other "note". These notes were simply rudely lithographed
promises "to pay one day after sight", in Melbourne or Geelong,
where the principal store of issuer was, the amounts specified in
the "notes," which were of various amounts, from 5s. upwards.
Suppose a purchaser of goods had got some of the notes from the
Burnbank store and on the next occasion for purchasing went to
the Colac or Robinson's store, the persons in charge of the
latter would not accept of the notes of the rival establishment,
to which the holder of them must go unless he was willing to lose
their value. The system was an intolerable nuisance while it
lasted, but it had soon to be abolished, change for purchases
being reduced to a minimum by the sale of so many ounces or
pennyweights of gold to the storekeeper, the balance, if any,
being made good by boxes of matches and the like, to the
satisfaction generally of both parties to the transaction. It is
on record that very small potatoes, reckoned at the rate of
threepence each, served as small change to a storekeeper who is
now one of the wealthiest of Victorian colonists.</blockquote>
<p>The first woman who arrived among the diggers was a
bullock-driver's wife, whose husband had left his bullocks and
turned to gold seeking. Next came Mrs. Thomas Bath, who was in
fact, either the first woman, or among the first half dozen or so
of women, who settled on the gold-field. After her others came at
wide and dreary intervals in angelic similitude; but when the
first two years had passed, and the gold-field had acquired some
elements of permanency women joined their husbands, sons, and
brothers already here, or came with newcomers, and thus gradually
the diggers' social life assumed a greater similarity to that of
older settlements.</p>
<p>The first meetings for the celebration of divine worship in
public were held by a few Wesleyans, who assembled in a mia-mia,
or tent of boughs, as for a Christian feast of Tabernacles, in
the White Flat, where the smithie belonging to Mr. John James,
late M.L.A., then stood, near the intersection of Grant street
and the Yarrowee. For greater privacy these Wesleyans used to go
from the tent of boughs to the denser bush then adjacent, and,
seated on fallen logs, hold there the "class-meeting",&mdash;that
private service which is peculiar to the Wesleyan family of
Christians. They were after that held in a hut on Winter's Flat,
and in a tent at the White Flat, when the Golden Point rush was
at its height. One of those early "Wesleyan worshippers" writes
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The first service was held on Sunday morning, the
28th Sept., 1851, on the flat, preacher (local) Mr. J. Sanderson,
about one hundred present, text Corinthians II, "Ye are bought
with a price." Class meeting at two o'clock in Sanderson's tent
on Golden Point. Mr. Hastie came, attracted by the singing, and
requested the aid of the singers, and waited half-an-hour, and
took them to his service at the Commissioners' Camp. Sunday
following, 5th October, Rev. Mr. Lewis, Wesleyan minister, from
Geelong, preached on the flat at eleven o'clock and at the Black
Hill in the evening. Subscriptions for a chapel rolled in and on
the 12th November, in the afternoon, Mr. Sanderson opened the new
chapel; text 12th Chap. Isaiah, "Behold, God is my salvation."
The chapel was of saplins and boughs with tarpaulin over it, no
pulpit. James Oddie was at the opening service. The day was a
very stormy one. Mr. William Howell was the treasurer. A Mr.
Jones of Tasmania, gave the first pound, and nuggets rolled in
fast and furious. No other service was held in the building. The
rush to Forest Creek took away the population the next
week.</blockquote>
<p>The social, if not aggressive, missionary spirit of
Wesleyanism had earlier proof in Victoria than even in those
services at Golden Point. M'Combie, in his "History of Victoria",
has the following passage:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>In April, 1836, before the city of Melbourne existed,
the Rev. Mr. Orton, a Wesleyan minister of Van Diemen's Land, who
had accompanied Mr. Batman when that gentleman brought his family
across Bass' Straits, celebrated divine service beneath the
beautiful casuarina trees which adored the crest of Batman's
Hill. Those who assembled to worship upon this interesting
occasion belonged to many races and countries; they were a pretty
fair average from the adjoining colonies and the islands of Great
Britain. Mr. Batman's Sydney blacks also attended, while not a
few of the aborigines, who had been attracted by the
preparations, had crowded in. The Church of England service was
read, and an excellent discourse preached from the text, "Except
a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God;" and we
have heard from one who was present that the first sermon
delivered by a regularly ordained clergyman on the site of the
great metropolis was striking and orthodox.</blockquote>
<p>The Wesleyans discovered similar activity when, in 1852, the
crowding hosts of gold-seeking immigrants could not find houses
to enter in Melbourne, not even at the enormous rents then
demanded. The Government was at its wits' end and did its slow
and cumbrous best to procure shelter for the crowd, but Mr.
Latrobe thus refers to the Wesleyans in a despatch on 28th
October, 1852, to Earl Grey:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The Wesleyan body have the credit of taking the lead,
by a very large collection, amounting, as I am informed, to near
£2000, and the immediate commencement of a "Refuge for the
Houseless", primarily for those in connection with their
particular community, but in effect as far as their means will
allow, for any who might be found to require it.</blockquote>
<p>Some who joined in those tent or hut services, in the midst of
the hot fever of the first rush to the marvellous riches of
Golden Point, became active honorable men in our public life, and
some are at this day filling positions more or less prominent in
both ecclesiastical and secular life. The Rev. Thomas Hastie, of
Buninyong, and the Roman Catholic Father Dunne, of Geelong, used
to visit the diggings also and minister to their several flocks
at irregular intervals. Father Dunne's first church was a tent
near Brown Hill where the worshippers, or some of them, had to
kneel upon quartz gravel as the mysteries of the mass were
celebrated. The Wesleyans built the first place of worship, the
site being on a knoll near Sinclair's Hill, and named by them
Wesley Hill. They then built a weatherboard church where the
Eastern Town-hall now stands. The Roman Catholics, Anglicans, and
Presbyterians, were close upon the heels of the Wesleyans, and
other denominations followed, the first church building in
permanent materials being erected by the Wesleyans where their
present school-house now (1870) stands at the corner of Lydiard
and Dana streets. The first church there was built towards the
end of the year 1854, some stray bullets from the insurgent
diggers on the flat falling among the workmen while the building
was being built. The Rev. Theophilus Taylor was then
superintendent minister of the Wesleyan Church here. After
holding services in what was then the police-court, in Ballarat
West, the Church of England people built a small wooden church in
Armstrong street, where worship was held till Christ Church was
built in Lydiard street. The wooden church was afterwards a
billiard saloon, and then it became Pinkerton and Co.'s printing
office. The first Anglican Church in Eastern Ballarat was a tent
on the site of St. Paul's reserve. It was improved into a
weatherboard building and after that came the brick edifice of
to-day. When the diggings first commenced, Mr. Hastie, of
Buninyong, was accustomed to go to Ballarat and hold service in
the afternoon, when the greatest number of hearers could be
obtained. The service for some time was held in the open air, and
at different localities. Other ministers subsequently came, and
each chose the situation which seemed most suitable. When the
Eureka rush took place, a tent for worship was erected by the
Presbyterians on the Eureka Flat, and then a wooden church was
erected on Specimen Hill. The congregation became settled, Mr.
Hastie urged them to call a minister, and in 1855 the Rev. James
Baird was called and ordained. A service in Gaelic was Iftld
every Sunday afternoon for some time there. During the time Mr.
Baird was minister Ballarat West was gradually rising into
importance, and for a time, service was held between both places,
but ultimately, it was entirely removed to the West and held in
the council chamber, near the corner of Sturt and Lydiard
streets. During this period the Soldier's' Hill site was
obtained, and a church built; the union, however, now took place,
and as the Sturt street site, was reckoned most convenient, a
church was erected there and the Soldiers' Hill church was
converted into a school. In 1858 Mr. Baird resigned and returned
to Britain, when the Rev. Wm. Henderson was called and
inducted.</p>
<p>Schools and newspapers sprang up, too, during these first
three years, and the population increased from Governor Latrobe's
hypothetical census of 6000 to over four times that number. The
bills of newspaper mortality showed a strong tendency in the
early papers to early death. Mr. Alfred Clarke, as the
representative of Mr. Harrison (then proprietor of the <i>Geelong
Advertiser</i>), attempted to bring a printing press here in
October, 1851, for the purpose of bringing out a paper to be
called the <i>Boninyong Gazette and Mining Journal</i>&mdash;for
it must be remembered that Buninyong was then the only recognised
settlement. It was a township of some antiquity, and Ballarat was
but an aboriginal name in the aboriginal bush, or in the hardly
less barbarous diggings. Clarke's dray with the press got bogged
on the way up from Geelong, and in the meantime Clarke had a
little feud with the commissioner of the day about the site
selected on Old Post-office Hill, the press was packed off to
Geelong again, and thus ended the first essay in the direction of
newspaper literature here. The <i>Ballarat Times and Southern
Cross</i> was the first paper actually published in Ballarat, the
first number being published on the 4th March, 1854, at an office
in Mair street, opposite the Market Square. Subsequently the
<i>Times</i> office was removed to Bakery Hill, near the
intersection of the present Victoria and Humffray streets, by the
proprietor and editor, Henry Seekamp, The paper lived for several
years, and died on the 5th of October, 1861. The <i>Leader</i>
was the next adventure. It was a joint-stock affair, and only
made six appearances. The <i>Creswick Chronicle</i> was next
brought out by Mr. J.J. Ham, an old colonist and experienced
journalist. It died in the bloom of early youth, after two or
three issues only. In July, 1855, appeared the <i>Ballarat
Trumpeter</i>, a gratuitous sheet, which in 1856 was published as
a tri-weekly, under the joint ownership of Messrs. Wheeler,
Fletcher, and Evans. It lived about twelve months, and was the
nucleus of the <i>Ballarat Standard</i>. Then came the
<i>Star</i>. It appeared as a tri-weekly journal on the 22nd
September, 1855, under a joint-stock proprietary, with Messrs.
Samuel Irwin and J.J. Ham as editors. After some four months it
was discontinued for a week, and then it re-appeared, having
passed into private hands in the interval, and in December, 1856,
appeared daily as at present. On the 10th November, 1856, the
<i>Ballarat Standard</i> appeared, and some time previously the
Nation. The <i>Standard</i>, owned by Messrs. D.D. Wheeler and W.
Cooper, was a tri-weekly, edited by Mr. W. Cooper (subsequently
of the <i>Portland Guardian</i>). It made its last appearance on
the 26th of the month in which it was born. Mr. Denovan,
afterwards M.L.A. for Sandhurst, edited the Nation, which
peacefully expired after less than a dozen issues. In 1857 an
attempt at the facetious was made, and a <i>Ballarat Punch</i>
appeared, and laughed at some of our follies, and chided some of
our sins. Mr. Hasleham, then correspondent of the <i>Melbourne
Herald</i>, conducted the new comer through a portion of its
short and merry career, and Mr. C.E. Moore designed a capital
title page for it that never appeared for want of the necessary
wood or stone gravers. The comic little paper had several owners
and editors, but none of them could make it live. In August,
1857, appeared the <i>Corn Stalk</i>, a monthly quarto of 4
pages, "printed and published for the proprietors, J. and T.
Oddie." It was edited by Mr. J.N. Wilson, now the chairman of the
Ballarat Water Commission; and it is noticeable that the ninth
number now before us (April, 1858) has for its leading article an
essay declaring that "a plentiful supply of good water for
domestic and commercial purposes is, above all things, what
Ballarat wants." The article is backed up by extracts from
letters from Messrs. J. Learmonth and T. Waldie, showing that not
only Burrumbeet and Yuille's, but even the rivers Moorabool,
Leigh, and Barwon had, within their memory, been dry. Newspaper
enterprise then flagged for a while, until, on the 24th March,
1859, a little company of adventurers brought out the <i>North
Grenville Mercury</i>, Mr. M.G. Byrne, afterwards a barrister,
being editor. It was pluckily maintained, first as a tri-weekly
and then as a daily, in all for some twenty weeks, when, after a
hundred appearances, it was also welcomed by the journalistic
Capulets to their tomb. The <i>Tribune</i> came next, appearing
on the 21st of November, 1861, and ending on the 11th July, 1863,
Mr. Harrison, previously of the <i>Ballarat Times</i>, being the
manager and editor, and at last sole proprietor. The <i>Ballarat
Sun</i> arose on the 26th September 1864, and appeared daily
under the auspices of a joint-stock proprietary. After a
troublous lift; and change of ownership, it sank below the
horizon during the following year. Advertising sheets,
distributed gratuitously, appeared and disappeared at intervals
all the years after 1854, and on some Saturday in August,
1856&mdash;the date missing from the copy before
us&mdash;appeared <i>The Chinese Advertiser</i>, a medley of
Chinese and English, but mostly Chinese, which was to be a
"pioneer of Christianity and Christian civilisation among the
Chinese in Australia," and was printed from stone, by Robert
Bell, Main Road, Ballarat. Mr. Bell remains, and so do a good
many of the Chinese, but the <i>Advertiser</i> has long since
disappeared. On the 25th of May, 1863, appeared the <i>Evening
Post</i>, at once our first evening and first penny paper. It has
had several changes of ownership. The <i>Ballarat Courier</i>,
Messrs. Bateman and Clark, proprietors, first appeared on the
10th of June, 1867, and the <i>Evening Mail</i>, the last-born of
the newspapers, on the 6th of April, 1869. It was started by a
band of printers, then, in the hands of the same company, was
registered with an increased capital under the Trading Companies
Statute, and, eventually, was incorporated with the <i>Evening
Post</i>. <i>Ballarat Punch</i> revived also, and struggled
against fate till February, 1870, when it disappeared. It was
started by the late C.A. Abbot, who was both artist and editor,
as well as proprietor. Buninyong, Creswick, Clunes, and
Smythesdale all had papers of their own; and even Sebastopol, the
most juvenile of boroughs, has had its local newspaper. In
recording this list of publications, we have travelled beyond the
period set down at the head of the chapter, but have done so as
being more convenient than otherwise. The physical difficulties
in the way of printing were great in the early days of the
gold-fields, as in the beginning of all new settlements. Some of
these difficulties have been referred to in the text. Mr. D.D.
Wheeler, who was one of the founders of the <i>Standard</i> and
<i>Trumpeter</i> and a shareholder in the first <i>Star</i>
co-partnership, writes of the latter journal:&mdash;"Its first
number was printed and published in the middle of a hurricane and
inundation, with the printers nearly up to their middle in
water." This was in what is now Bridge street before the levels
were raised there. Mr. Wheeler hazards the opinion that the
Nation appeared more times than is stated in the text. He may be
literally correct, but the facts are not materially different. As
to the <i>Trumpeter</i>, Mr. Wheeler says:&mdash;"It was revived
by its original proprietor early in January, 1856, and continued
for about twelve months, when it lost its ground in competition
with the <i>Star</i> and <i>Times</i>." The competitive fates
fell afterwards upon the <i>Times</i>, which succumbed to the
<i>Star</i>; and the <i>Star</i>, though still alive and holding
a high position, has had to see the <i>Courier</i> outstrip it in
the race and take the place of local journalistic leadership. The
<i>Star</i> had many owners. From the original proprietary it
passed to Messrs. Wanliss and Belford; then to Wanliss alone;
then to J. Noble Wilson; then to H.R. Nicholls and Co.; then to a
joint stock proprietary; then to the <i>Courier</i> proprietors;
then to the present owners, Messrs. Martin and Grose, who are
also proprietors of the <i>Creswick Advertiser</i>. The
<i>Commonwealth</i>, a monthly publication, appeared for the
first time in March, 1870. It was edited by Mr. W. Clarke, Grand
Master of the Orange Lodges in Victoria, but it has long since
vanished.<br></p>

<br>
<p>The caterers for the amusement of the early diggers had ample
patronage in those days. The first theatrical venture was in
December, 1853, when a canvas house was set up in the Gravel
Pits, the leading actress afterwards becoming the wife of the
editor and proprietor of the <i>Ballarat Times</i>. A person
named Clarke opened a similar theatre on the Eureka in February,
1854, and soon after that Mrs. Hanmer opened a weatherboard
theatre called the Adelphi, where the Tontine, and more recently
called the Windsor hotel, afterwards stood in Esmond, now Durham,
street east. The Charlie Napier, Montezuma, and Victoria theatres
in Main street, all long since burnt down, speedily followed with
larger accommodations and better performances. There came
afterwards, drawn by the fame of the golden colony, some of the
most accomplished histrionic artistes of the time. Catherine
Hayes, Anna Bishop, Lola Montes, Brooke, Kean, Ellen Tree, Sir
William and Lady Don, Jefferson, Celeste, Montgomery, were among
the brighter stars that have risen upon our auriferous horizon.
Lucy Chambers, an Australian by birth and a singer of European
fame, appeared in opera; Charles Mathews, the comedian, Madame
Ristori, and nearly every artist of high rank who came to
Victoria also appeared in this city. Further details of dramatic
business will be found in a future chapter.</p>
<p>The first magistrate sat of course at Buninyong. Mr. Eyre was
the officer, and he used to visit the diggings at intervals. The
finding of the first monster nugget at Canadian Gully in
February, 1853, caused a new rush thither, and in that rush came
Mr. Adam Loftus Lynn, who was the first attorney that practised
here. After spending the months of February, March, and April in
digging, he began to practise his profession on the 1st of May,
his office being then opposite to the <i>Ballarat Times</i>
office of that day. About six months after Mr. Lynn had commenced
practice, he was joined by Mr. Ocock. After them came, in time, a
forensic deluge. The first local County Court and Court of
General Sessions were opened by the late Judge Wrixon, with Mr.
Francis Greene as clerk of the peace, in January, 1853, at
Buninyong, the original style of the County Court being "The
County Court of Buninyong and Ballarat." It retained this style
till the sixties. The court style, the judge, the clerk, all are
dead and buried, but Mr. W. Tweedie, the first bailiff is still
(1887) bailiff; and as County Courts in Victoria may soon be
merged in some other court, the first bailiff may also be the
last of the old order. The courts presided over by Judge Wrixon
first sat at Ballarat near the end of the year 1853. Mr. Justice
Williams opened the first Circuit Court in Ballarat on the 12th
December, 1856, in what was then the police court-house, the
county court-house, and the place where the English Church
service was performed. The building stood in what is now Camp
street, on the western side, where the street bends round near
the Freemasons Hall. In respect of the courts of law we have gone
beyond the period set down at the head of this chapter, but we
have done so by way of convenience to the reader.</p>
<p>One of the Victorian sensations of 1852 was the robbery of
several thousand ounces of gold from the ship Nelson in Hobson's
Bay, on 2nd April, by a band, of whom one Roberts was a
conspicuous confederate. He was sentenced with others but proved
an <i>alibi</i> and was released. He then fell into the hands of
the police in the Ballarat district and early in 1853 was in
custody for horse stealing. He and others were at the Separation
inn, at Leigh Road, on the way to the seaboard for trial,
examination, or sentence. Handcuffed as he was, Roberts managed
to slip them off, and he then jumped clean through one of the
hotel windows, and bolted. He was at large for some time, but
still in the first half of the same year he was known to be
hiding somewhere near Beaufort. Mr. G.G. Morton, of Labona, who
had landed in the colony in October, 1852, and obtained from Mr.
Latrobe a cadetship in the police force, was sent with the cadets
to Ballarat, where they arrived on the 29th September of that
year, Morton being subsequently appointed to the charge of the
Wimmera district. When Roberts was known to be lurking about
Beaufort, Morton, accompanied by a stalwart trooper named
Worsley, and an aboriginal who was supposed to know where Roberts
was, set forth to attempt the capture of the horse stealer. The
aboriginal pointed out as the robber's lair a bark hut in the
ranges, known on the run as the Waterloo hut, the site being that
afterwards opened up as the Waterloo diggings. Morton arranged
with Worsley the <i>modus belli</i> <a name="FNanchor_05" id=
"FNanchor_05"></a><a href="#fn05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
whereby Morton was to burst in the hut door and fall down in the
hut, Worsley to be close at his heels and cover the robber with
firearms. This was done to the letter, Roberts being there with
another man, a vagrant unconnected with the horse stealing. The
police had only to do with Roberts, the other man being harmless,
and being told to take no part if he valued his own life or
liberty. Roberts, being covered by Worsley, began to show fight;
Morton sprang to his feet and felled the robber with the butt end
of a pistol as the ruffian was exclaiming: "Yes, I'm Roberts, you
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and you shan't take me alive." The
officers soon had the handcuffs upon him, and strapped him to
Worsley's stirrup, Morton being ready to prod him with a sabre if
he did not march peaceably to his fate. Roberts used much
emphatic but unrecordable language, and still made show of
resistance at first, but soon submitted to the march, and was
safely lodged in gaol, and eventually sentenced.</p>
<p>This Roberts was an old convict who had come out in 1844, and
when he obtained his freedom he took to the roads and was for a
time associated with the notorious Captain Melville, who
strangled himself in the Melbourne gaol. He was only 37 when
arrested at Waterloo, and by the time he was sentenced thereafter
he had a total of 32 years imprisonment imposed for three charges
of highway robbery and assault, including five years in irons.
The ruffian began a life of crime very early, and his frequent
imprisonments had afforded leisure, as does the sequestered life
of the sailor, for the indulgence of that strange fancy for
tattooing which seems to fascinate convict and sailor alike. Here
is the gaol record of "particular marks":&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Sun, heart, and dart; foul anchor, soldier and woman
R.D.A.B.; launch, cross flags and crown on left arm. Crucifix,
maltese cross, flags, skull and bones, sword and pistol on right
arm.</blockquote>
<p>By the end of the year 1852 the diggers on the gutters had
begun to reach what was then called deep ground, and their
vocation soon after that began, though rudely and tentatively, to
assume more of the character of regular mining. The year 1853 was
rich in new discoveries, and a large number of gullies were then
opened. The Canadian, opened early in 1851, was named from a man
called Canadian Swift. The gully and issuing gutter were very
rich, the first large nugget ever found being unearthed there
about February, 1853. It weighed 1620 oz., and has never been
surpassed in weight by any discoveries since, except by the
Welcome nugget, found on the reef in some old ground on Bakery
Hill on the 9th of June, 1858 (weight, 2217 oz.), and the Welcome
Stranger, found at Mount Moliagul on the 5th of February, 1869
(weight, 2280 oz). A rich bend in the gutter known as the
Jewellers' Shops, was about two hundred yards from where the
nugget was found. The ground there was prodigiously rich in gold,
heavy, lumpy, bright gold in profusion, and hence the name given
to the spot. The gutter ran down the valley, and mingled with the
other golden streams that met in the area formerly known as the
Gum Tree Flat, into which also the Red Hill, Red Streak, Eureka,
Bakery Hill, Gravel Pits, and their tributaries poured their
golden wealth. Dr. Gibson, Muir, and others of the Gravel Pits
gutter near the Prince Albert hotel (afterwards St. John's
Presbyterian Church), opposite to the present Hebrew Synagogue,
and Rowland and Party in Sailor's Gully, appear to have been
among the earlier miners who slabbed their shafts throughout.
Gibson's first essay was with frame and piles; but before that,
in 1852, Mr. Beilby and others used saplings to secure unsafe
shafts, and others lined the shafts with slabs of bark placed
vertically and fastened with sapling frames. The claims known as
the Italians', where the Gravel Pits entered the Gum Tree Flat,
were famous for their heavy deposits of gold. The Eureka, the
Canadian, and the Gravel Pits leads, all opened just after the
first rush to Golden Point, were the famous golden trinity that
made Ballarat world-renowned. The Eureka ran from Little Bendigo
southwards beneath the Yarrowee and the present Railway,
Humffray, Victoria and Eureka streets, into Pennyweight Flat,
where it was joined, near the old Charlie Napier, or a hundred
yards or so south-east from the intersection of Main and Eureka
streets, by the Canadian, both flowing with other leads into the
Gum Tree Flat, where they were joined by the Gravel Pits and
Bakery Hill, which ran from the foot of Black Hill across the
present Humffray street and Victoria street to the general place
of confluence in the Gum Tree Flat&mdash;that area of ground the
eastern edge of which Main street now traverses. The combined
lead, which was in fact the main ancient stream flowing over the
primeval bed rocks, ran westward, and entered beneath the
basaltic plateau of Ballarat West, just below the intersection of
Sturt and Lydiard streets, where it took a southern bend, and
received a tributary from Golden Point. This tributary, being the
first registered gutter, gave the name to the main stream which
flowed on westward and southward, receiving many tributaries in
its course. This is, however, anticipatory in point of time. The
year 1853 was marked by a vigorous prospecting. In that year, the
whole range north and south of the Ballarat Flat was opened up.
Prince Regent's, Sailor's, Scotchman's, and New Chum Gullies on
the eastern slope of the Golden Point range, and Terrible, White
Horse, Frenchman's, Chinamen's, and Cobbler's Gullies on the
western slope, were in that year entered upon in their shallower
portions. On the Black Hill side, besides that hill and the
adjacent gullies and Little Bendigo, Dead Horse, Sulky, and other
gullies on the way to Creswick were opened. Apropos of
Frenchman's Gully, it may here be noted that Esmond, the Clunes
gold discoverer, found a 70-oz. nugget in the shallow ground in
1853. In the following year, while Sir Charles and Lady Hotham
were on a visit here, a nugget weighing 98½ lbs. was found in
Dalton's Flat, and called the Lady Hotham after the wife of the
Governor. By that time the quartz lodes at the Black Hill had
been tested. Dr. Otway, with whom was Mr. Osborne, was the first
adventurer there, and he erected a windmill as a motive power for
reducing the stone. After that he procured Chilian mills, but
neither process was successful. Mr. George Milner Stephen
followed Dr. Otway, and with similar results. The Port Phillip
Company then came upon the scene, operating both at Black Hill
and on the ranges at Dead Horse, but with small success. That
company soon found better fortune at the Clunes reefs, from which
it drew for many years a large annual revenue.</p>
<p>Thus the three first years after the gold discovery saw some
of the richest of the Ballarat gutters, opened up, most of the
rich shallow grounds once or twice dug over, a population of from
30,000 to 40,000 assembled, lines of streets thickly inhabited by
dwellers in canvas or wood, churches, theatres, hotels, bowling
alleys, dancing saloons, stores in plenty and all the elements
present of a rough, prosperous, young gold-fields settlement;
while enterprising prospectors were still pushing out on every
side, and adding fresh discoveries to those that had already made
Ballarat famous in every part of the civilised world.</p>

<div class="dropcap"><img alt="" src=
"1304971h-images/Drop04.jpg"></div>
<div>O W N the swift stream of the brief years we now come to
troublous times. At the root of all the troubles that led to the
Eureka Stockade, lay the old tyranny of taxation without
representation. When the gold discovery occurred, Victoria had
not long been created an independent colony. It had become
independent then only in the sense of separation from New South
Wales, and in having a Lieutenant-Governor and a Parliament of
its own. But that Parliament was not representative in more than
a small degree. It was a single House, and largely composed of
nominees of the Crown, the balance of members representing
constituencies in which the masses, gathered and increasing on
the gold-fields, had, not simply not a voice potential, but
absolutely no voice at all. This was an injustice that was
attended with more than the usual dangers that accompany wrong.
The gold-fields inhabitants being outside the mystic circle of
governing power were placed, <i>ab initio</i>, <a name=
"FNanchor_06" id="FNanchor_06"></a><a href="#fn06" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a> in an attitude of hostility to the constituted
authorities. An unnatural separation was, so to speak, created by
the law between the majority of the people and the Crown; and to
give intensity to the danger, the people here were for the most
part superior in mental and bodily capacities to the average
capacities of their fellow countrymen whom they had left in their
fatherlands. The courage and adventure which had made them
emigrants, and the physical strength which had enabled them to
weather the rude elements of early gold-fields life, were
qualities which made them valuable as freemen, but dangerous as
slaves. They were not the men tamely to brook the voiceless
poverty of political power which marked the ante-Eureka Stockade
era; and when to the absence of representation were added the
insolence of gold-fields officials, the indignities of
quasi-martial regulations, and dark suspicions of corruption, the
elements of disorder rapidly grew more and more menacing to the
public peace, until, at last, it needed only the proverbial want
of tact in official routine to permit the recurrence of
irritations that fell like sparks upon prepared combustibles.
Then a flame burst out that was partially quenched in blood, the
black disorder of the conflagration being cleared away only by
that reform of grievances which has given to us what we now
possess.</div>

<br>
<span class="u">The First Quartz Crushing Battery, base of Black
Hill, Ballaarat, 1855</span></p>
<br>
<p>When the European gold hunter arrived in Victoria, just after
the gold discovery, he no sooner found himself upon the
gold-fields than he was, as we have seen, brought into contact
with a Government in the construction of which, and in the
direction of whose policy, he had no more voice than the naked
aborigine he saw prowling about the bush. Before he could legally
put pick or shovel into the ground, the digger had to pay a heavy
monthly tax, levied upon him by a Government and Parliament in
which he was not represented. At first for thirty shillings, then
for sixty shillings, and then again for thirty shillings per
month, the digger obtained a license in this or some nearly
identical form:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><span class="u">GOLD LICENSE.</span></p>
<p class="quote">
No.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;185<br>

<br>
The bearer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
having paid to me the sum of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on account of
the territorial revenue, I hereby license him to dig, search for,
and remove gold on and from any such Crown lands within the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
as I shall assign to him for that purpose during the month of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
185&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , not within half-a-mile of any head
station.<br>
<br>
This license is not transferable and must be produced whenever
demanded by me or any other person acting under the authority of
the Government.</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">
(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. B.,
Commissioner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this we have the symbol of the grievances that roused the
gold-fields population. There was a heavy tax levied monthly by a
non-representative executive; that tax was often oppressive in
itself and unequal in its incidence, and it was often collected
in so insolent a manner, that its unpopularity became a
thousandfold greater.</p>
<p>Here, illustrative of the sport of license or digger-hunting,
is an episode from a lecture by the late Mr. William Benson, once
an escort-trooper in South Australia, then a reporter on the
<i>Ballarat Times</i>, and subsequently a mining surveyor. The
lecture was delivered at a Working Men's Temperance Meeting, in
the Alfred Hall, on Saturday, the 19th February, 1870:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I had been for some short time in 1853 occupied at
the store of Messrs. Hilfling and Greig, on the township, where
the drapery establishment of David Jones and Co. now is. Not very
well liking my employment, I was on my way to the labor office on
Bakery Hill to offer for a stock-rider's billet. Being dressed in
somewhat digger costume, and talking near where the Yarrowee
bridge now is, I heard behind me a stentorian voice&mdash;"Hallo!
you fellow." I turned round. Speechless horror! There, at full
galop, at the head of fifteen or twenty mounted troopers, with
scabbards clattering and stirrups jingling, rode a stalwart
black-looking chief of the digger hunters. "Hallo! I say, you,
sir," thundered forth he, with a mighty flourish of his sword
glittering in the beautiful sunlight, "have you got a license."
Worse luck to me I never was a digger, even when gold could be
got by pounds weight. Well, there flourished the sword of a
mighty hunter, and there stammered I forth "No." At that moment
up came the mounted and foot police. "Take this man into
custody", shouts out the leader of the troop and off he gallops.
I, in my simplicity, said the mighty hunter did not recognise me,
he was a sergeant in the foot police at Adelaide when I was a
government escort trooper there. "Well," says my custodian, "all
I know is that I am going to take you to quod." This was the
"logs", but all this time I was being taken away from the "logs"
(or Camp lock-up), and near where the corner of Barkly street now
is we there found another guardian of the spoil of the hunters,
holding in terror of his formidable weapon a real digger whose
clothes bespoke him to be a sojourner amongst the holes on the
Red Hill. We were marched up the slope of Golden Point, the
troopers and foot police far in advance; but I refused to go
further and sat down. One of the diggers near, espying my
bespattered comrade in distress, calls out "Hallo! mate, what's
the row?" "Got no license," grumbles out the Red Hill digger.
"Can't you give bail?" sings out the charitable-minded
questioner. "Not I," returns the other, "or I should'nt be
without a license." No more ado, but into his tent walks he of
the charitable mind, and out he shortly comes and walking
straight up to my fellow captive, thrusts into his brawny hands
five £1 notes, saying "There's thy bail money", and off he
walked. "Know you that man?" said I to my astonished mate in
misfortune. "Never saw him before in my life," he replied, "but
he is a good fellow and one of the right sort."</blockquote>
<p>Benson and his companion were both bailed, and, after the
examination before the bench, the digger was lined in the amount
of his bail. Benson escaped fine, and after some delay recovered
his bail. Such episodes abounded, with variations in detail. From
an unpublished manuscript by Mr. R.M. Serjeant, descriptive of
the times under discussion, the following comic picture is
taken:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>We marked out a couple of claims on the Eureka, and
one or two more at Prince Regent's Gully. On returning home one
afternoon we found our gully (Specimen Gully) surrounded by the
force on the hunt for licenses. I noticed our sod chimney
smoking, and the hut door&mdash;an old flour sack stretched on a
frame of wattle saplins&mdash;wide open, so I concluded Joe, our
cooking mate, was about, and could not very well escape two of
the police who were marching straight into the doorway. I had
approached to within a few yards of the scene, license paper in
hand, when the traps stepped back, as I thought, rather hastily,
and, to my surprise, were confronted on the threshhold by a
smart, genteel-looking female, who politely enquired their
business, and the next moment espying me close in the rear,
said&mdash;"Perhaps my brother can answer your enquiries,
gentlemen!" The gentlemen, however, were not among the rudest of
their class, begged pardon, and turned on their heels in search
of more easy prey, while I proceeded to introduce myself to my
newly-found sister, whom I then saw throwing up her heels and
cutting most unladylike capers round the dining table. In the
course of the evening Joe intimated that as he had resolved never
to take out a license, he should, if we had no objection,
continue to wear his new style of attire, and that in future his
name was to be Josephine.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Serjeant gives us another lively view of the digger
hunting process:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Traps! Traps!! Joe! Joe!!" were the well-known
signals which announced that the police were out on a license
raid, now becoming almost of daily occurrence. The hasty
abandonment of tubs and cradles by fossickers and outsiders, and
the great rush of shepherds to the deep holes on the flat as the
police hove in view, readily told that there were not a few among
them who believed in the doctrine that "base is the slave who
pays." Hunting the digger was evidently regarded by Mr.
Commissioner Sleuth and his hounds as a source of delightful
recreation, and one of such paramount importance to the State
that the sport was reduced to an exact science. Thus, given a
couple of dirty constables, in diggers' guise, jumping a claim,
gentle shepherd approaches with delapidated shovel on shoulder
and proceeds to dispossess intruders in summary manner. A great
barney ensues: Constable Derwent and his mate talk big, a crowd
gathers round, and "a ring! a ring!!" is the cry. The combatants
have just commenced to shape, when the signal referred to at the
head of this paragraph rings through the flat. On come the traps
in skirmishing order, driving in the stragglers as they advance,
and supported by mounted troopers in the rear, who occupy
commanding positions on the ranges. A great haul is made, and
some sixty prisoners are marched off in triumph to the Camp,
hand-cuffed together like a gang of felons, there to be dealt
with according to the caprice or cupidity of their
oppressors.</blockquote>
<p>Irwin, in his letters to the <i>Geelong Advertiser</i>,
corroborates Benson's account of the hunting mode, and gives,
under date 23rd October, 1854, the following statement in
explanation of resolutions adopted at a meeting in the Roman
Catholic Chapel on Bakery Hill, expressive of sympathy with
Father Smyth, and of indignation against Commissioner
Johnstone:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Some time since Mr. Johnstone was in command of a
license-hunting party, one of whom, named Lord, came up to a tent
in which was John Gregory, a foreigner, on a visit of charity to
some other foreigners whose language he knew. The trooper Lord
ordered the "&mdash;&mdash; wretches" to come out of the tent
that he might see their licenses. Gregory, the servant of the
Rev. Mr. Smyth, had no such document; on seeing which the
trooper, damning him and the priest, ordered him to come along.
As Gregory is not very strong-limbed, he requested to be allowed
to go to the Camp himself, as he was not able to follow the force
while visiting the various diggings looking for unlicensed
miners. So far right; but on Gregory's appearing unwilling or
unable to follow, the trooper ill-used him, and only let him off
on Mr. Smyth depositing £5 bail for his appearance. At the
Police-office, after being fined £5 for not having a license,
Gregory was going away, but was recalled. On re-appearing, the
charge of wanting a license was withdrawn by Mr. Johnstone, and
one of assaulting a trooper put instead. For this he, the
cripple, was fined the original £5 bail. In the whole affair the
Rev. Mr. Smyth was certainly treated with but little courtesy;
and the trumpery story of a cripple assaulting an able-bodied
mounted trooper is too ridiculous to warrant serious
attention.</blockquote>
<p>Englishmen, free from crime, were at the mercy in those days
of many demoralised and ruffianly policemen, who treated the
diggers like felons, and were too often abetted by their
superiors in this treatment of men thus practically deprived of
two centuries of political progress. To these causes of
irritation were added suspicions of corruption in the
administration of the common law on the Ballarat gold-field, and
this it was, as will presently appear, that precipitated the
events which ended in the collision between the Queen's troops
and the armed insurgents. Begun at Bendigo in 1853, the agitation
against the gold-fields license tax, and for representation in
Parliament, was quickly taken up in Ballarat, and was there
pushed forward with more eventful incident to a more tragic
conclusion. The outbreak was not that of a stupid, stolid,
ignorant peasantry in arms against hay stacks and threshing
machines, but of free-spirited, intelligent, people, goaded to
resistance by intolerable wrong, and guided&mdash;at all events
during a portion of the period&mdash;by men of education and
character among themselves, aided by a provincial Press created
and sustained for the most part by men also from among their own
ranks. When commissioners, magistrates, and troopers, had got
used to treating the diggers as people to be taxed and harried at
pleasure, the offensive method of carrying out the obnoxious
license law had grown so irksome that a reform of the whole
system was irresistibly pressed upon the population. A Reform
League was formed for the redress of grievances, and all the
gold-fields supported the organisation. Towards the middle of
1854, Mr. Latrobe's successor. Sir Charles Hotham, and Lady
Hotham, visited Ballarat, and, in spite of the existing
grievances, they were loyally received. In connection with the
visit there was some prominence acquired by a gigantic Irish
digger, called Big Larry, who, with a rougher Raleigh-like
politeness, not only assiduously planked over muddy spots for the
dainty feet of the Governor's wife, but sometimes carried that
representative lady bodily over portions of the ground, and
generally cleared a way for the visitors through the crowd of
spectators. It may be that his Excellency and his Melbourne
advisers were led, by the welcome given by the diggers, to
misconstrue the mind of the gold-fields population, and to think
that all the Camp officials, instead of a very small minority
only, were proper men properly enforcing the law. Be that as it
may, the Government not only maintained the law, but sought to
enforce it with greater rigor. In October, 1854, the Government
sent up an order that the police should go out two days a week
hunting for unlicensed diggers. At that time there were four
commissioners at Ballarat, between whom the field was parcelled
out in four divisions; but the boundaries being ill-defined, the
police often hunted over the same ground twice, and thus the
rudeness which too often marked the process of license-fee
collection was often repeated over and over again upon the same
man in the same day.</p>
<p>Mr. Joseph Roff, clothier, at present a member of the Town
Council, writing to the author respecting the early days,
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The storekeepers were embittered against the
Government, not only from a natural sympathy with their
customers, the diggers, but also from a want of protection from
lawless vagabonds let loose from the various colonies, and who
were ever ready to rob or murder law-abiding citizens. To remedy
this a meeting was called, asking the authorities for a night
patrol, and the citizens meanwhile formed themselves into a body
for the protection of life and property. As the stores were
mostly of canvas at that time, a knife was all that was needed,
for the most part, to enter a store, the only protection being a
revolver kept close at hand for instant use. I well remember the
early morning drills in the ranges for revolver practice, with a
sheet of paper pinned to a tree for a target, and fired at from a
distance of ten or twenty paces. One Minter morning, between one
and two o'clock&mdash;the night being divided into
watches&mdash;my watch had come. An adjoining store had been
stuck up the night before, and, stung by the recollection of
sleepless nights and constant anxiety, I had sworn to shoot the
first thief who dared to attack my place. At that very moment of
my watch I heard footsteps coming nearer and nearer, and, as it
seemed to mo, with stealthy tread. A stop was made just where I
had been sleeping. Immediate and silent as a cat I sprang from my
blankets to the floor, placing the muzzle of my shooter in a line
with the foe, who, in the coolest manner possible, struck a
match, lit a candle, placed it in a bottle, and was apparently
searching for the weakest part of the canvas before cutting a
hole. "Villain," I muttered to myself in my thoughts, "I'll make
an example of you; if you dare to enter, I'll fire, let the
consequences be what they may." Minutes, which seemed like hours,
passed; the damp earth chilled my bare feet; not a sign was made;
what is the burglar up to? Peeping through an opening at the
doorway, I saw a digger holding up a light to the side of the
tent, and quietly and intently staring at it "What the deuce are
you up to there at this hour of the night?" I roared out. "Me?"
said the digger: "why, I've just come off my night shift, and
wanted to read the latest news from the Roosian war." My heart
sank within me, and I thanked God I did not fire; but this man
was certainly nigh being murdered. Going outside, I found that
Alfred Black, brother of the editor of the <i>Digger's
Advocate</i>, who lodged with me and slept on the counter, had
pasted up the latest number of the <i>Advocate</i> on the tent
side, headed "Latest news from the Russian war." So ended that
little episode. Shortly after that I had the satisfaction of
winging a burglar who had cut the canvas from floor to ceiling,
and was in the act of walking off with a bundle labelled with
neither his name or address.</blockquote>
<p>The tragical was intimately associated with the comical in
those days; the latter was sometimes born of the former. If the
woes of the diggers and the insults and injuries of the troopers
were tragical, they produced Thatcher's comical metrical gibes at
the authorities, and occasional theatrical farces with a
similarly caustic anti-police humour in them. Thatcher sang
nightly at the Charlie Napier, and amongst the farces of the day
was one produced at the Red Hill theatre, partly to suit the
requirements of a popular actor, and partly to have a fling at
the officials of the camp. It contained a scene laid at the Black
Hill, in which the authorities were pilloried as oppressors of
the diggers, and license hunting was ridiculed and denounced. The
audiences were not nicely critical, and every joke and every hit
were applauded with all the force of exceptionally sound lungs.
The more furious the fun, the better the diggers, as a rule,
liked the entertainment. Sometimes there were episodes of
exciting mirth not included in the bill of fare, and Mr. Roff,
whose recollections of the old days seem to be very graphic,
tells of one or two of those extra programme
performances:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I had the honor, he writes, of being costumier to the
first theatre in Ballarat. I was staying at the Criterion Hotel.
Red Hill, at that time the best on the Flat; it was of canvas,
and resembled a circus; beds were fitted up round the sides like
bunks in a ship, but hidden from view by calico hangings. The
tables and seats were permanent fixtures made of boards. The
theatre was made of wood and canvas, and was nearly opposite to
the hotel, A large and magnificent company were specially
engaged, with a complete and splendid orchestra. The pieces for
the opening night were, I think, Maritana, as a play, and the
Irish Tutor. The night was fine and warm, and the place was
crowded with diggers in every variety of costume. There were the
blue and red serge shirt, the tall Yankee hat, Hessian knee
boots, the long scarlet sashes, and all the audience ruddy with
health, and as jolly as sand boys. The curtain had descended on
the first piece, brandied peaches, sherry cobblers and spiders,
cocktails, and what not, had been consumed between the acts, and
the leading star had been encored, recalled, and shouted for in
champagne at least a dozen times. The curtain rose for the
after-piece, and the re-appearance of the star was greeted with
enthusiasm, although it was apparent that stellar demoralisation
had set in. As the piece proceeded, something was seen to have
gone wrong, and the face of the star reddened with rage. Turning
upon a subordinate actor who was leaving the stage, he severely
kicked the super., who turned round upon his leader and said:
"You may get as drunk as you like, but you don't kick me again,
if you do, I'm dashed." The star, approaching the footlights as
the curtain fell, said: "Ladies and gentlemen, the fellow says
I'm drunk. (Shouts from the audience.) If I did kick him he knows
he deserved it. (Go it old man.) Am I drunk, ladies and
gentlemen? (No, yes, pitch into him.) I'd rather be drunk any
time than a fool. Isn't it enough to make anybody drunk to have
to play with such idiots? Haven't I played before the Governor of
New South Wales&mdash;but am I drunk, gentlemen?" At this moment
some person from behind the curtain pitchforked the star forward
right over the footlights into the orchestra, and as he lay
astride the double bass, clutching the neck of it as for very
life, the whole audience rose and roared with laughter, the rapid
fun of the affair tickling them more than a dozen screaming
farces of the best low comedians.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Roff, after telling how a gold buyer secreted £1000 worth
of bank notes in his stove chimney overnight, and in the morning,
hearing his boy lighting a fire, rushed to the rescue of the
notes, but only in time to save a half-charred heap of paper
that, luckily, still showed most of the numbers, goes on to
detail the pains of a tailor with a cork leg. This tailor lived
in the first brick house built in Ballarat East, and had for next
room neighbours a band of Bohemians who made night hideous with
what they called harmony. The tailor lived like a martyr for a
while, though he had to rise early in those
ante-eight-hours-of-labor days; but his camel back was broken one
night by the harmonists striking up "The Cork Leg". As this
seemed to be adding brutal insult to much provoking injury, the
tailor resolved on revenge. Rising from bed, he pulled a big zinc
case into his room, and belabored it lustily with cork leg and a
stick. The Bohemians were vanquished. In fierce response to their
shouts of remonstrance, the tailor roared: "I've stood this
little game long enough. You'll have enough 'cork leg' before
you're done, so here goes for another hour, to see how you like
my harmony." Away banged the tailor with leg and arm upon the
sonorous metal, until the enemy, tired and beaten, retreated from
the field, and left the angry tailor to sleep thenceforth in
peace.</p>

Ballaarat, 1854.</span></p>
<br>
<p>Another of Mr. Roff's illustrations of the early times in
Ballarat refers to the period when that part of the city about
Drummond street was bush:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Adventuring beyond as far as what is now Pleasant
street one day with a companion sportsman, Mr. Rolf lost his
friend, and then himself; The native "cooey" failed to bring any
answering sound. I moved onwards, he says, and at last
thought&mdash;"Where am I?" Looking upwards and on all sides, I
replied&mdash;"Lost in the bush." Everywhere trees, openings,
bits of sky, but everywhere the same bush. I walked till I was
tired and bewildered. I sat down to rest, thirsty and perplexed;
then looking up again at the sun, I saw he was sinking in the
sky; westward, of course. Eureka! I have it; I will turn my back
to the sun, go forward, and that will take me eastward towards my
home. I rose and ran, often looking back to see how the sun lay,
and in less than two hours I saw a house; soon after that I
reached Winter's paddock, but it was getting dark. Before me,
right away on the hills and down in the valleys, shone the
illuminated stores and tents of the diggings, and I soon reached
my home. I had been for hours lost in the bush, and had travelled
some thirty miles or so; but I had not, probably, been at any
time more than three or four miles from the Ballarat post
office.</blockquote>
<p>While reform leagues and committees were organising during the
years 1853 and 1854, the population educated itself to a certain
degree in the discussion of grievances, and men came to the front
as popular leaders, some of whom remain to this day in public
life, as Mr. Lalor, at present (January, 1887) speaker of the
Legislative Assembly. Others there were who, more gifted in
committee than upon the public platform, quietly and effectively
aided the reform movement, but never rose or sought to rise to
the more prominent elevation of public celebrity. Many of these,
also, remain-with us to this day. "Digger hunting", as the
collection of the license fee was called by the men on the
gold-fields, continued incessantly, accompanied with frequent
instances of official tyranny. Informers were employed by the
authorities, and some of those men were mere creatures of the
higher officials, and had histories that helped from the first to
forbid confidence. The tide of irritation and discontent rose
higher and higher, and the more excited of the population began
to collect arms, to form leagues of their different
nationalities, and to discuss the probabilities of open
insurrection and a declaration of revolt from British rule. At
length, in the latter half of the year 1854, a digger named James
Scobie was killed in a scuffle at the Eureka hotel, on Specimen
Hill (now Eureka street), kept by one Bentley, who was considered
by the diggers to be a participator in Scobie's murder. The house
was one of very bad fame, and Bentley was arrested and brought
before a bench presided over by Mr. Dewes, the police magistrate,
who acquitted him. There were a few thoughtful men sitting in the
court at the time, who saw the gravity of what they felt to be a
glaring miscarriage of justice. One of them&mdash;Mr. J. Russell
Thomson&mdash;narrowly escaped committal for daring to urge that
Bentley's was a case which should be sent to a jury. This
acquittal aroused the population more than any single official
act since the gold discovery, for the general belief was that
Bentley was guilty, and that the police magistrate corruptly
urged the acquittal because he was under pecuniary obligations to
the prisoner. This opinion as to Dewes' embarrassments with
Bentley is still held. Dewes fell before the popular storm, went
to British Columbia, where he justified Victorian condemnation by
committing embezzlement, and he ended his life by suicide in
Paris. The exasperation caused by Bentley's acquittal gave a
vigorous impetus to the agitations for reform. At an indignation
meeting held on, or close to, the spot where Scobie was killed,
Messrs. J.B. Thomson, T.D. Wanliss, Peter Lalor, J.W. Gray, W.
Corkhill, Alex. M.P. Grant, and Archibald Carmichael were
appointed a committee to take steps for the collection of money
to defray the cost of a further prosecution of Bentley, and so
warmly did the public respond that £200 were gathered in a very
short time in Ballarat alone, when the collections were stopped,
as the Government, in the meantime, moved in the business and
offered rewards for the apprehension of Scobie's murderers. The
collector of the moneys, Mr. John W. Gray, returned the
subscriptions, after payment of some charges, and thus that
expression of indignation at wrong done was ended The other
gold-fields ardently joined in the feeling prevalent here In
Ballarat meetings were held on Sundays as well as on other days,
and on Saturday, 11th November, 1854, thousands of men gathered,
and flags and bands of music lent ominous life to the assemblage.
The leaders were in favor of moral force and a purely
constitutional agitation; but there were more fiery spirits than
they. One of these&mdash;a compatriot of Scobie&mdash;on another
occasion harangued the crowd, and said the spirit of the murdered
Scobie was hovering over them and yearning for revenge. The
occasion referred to was a meeting held near Bentley's hotel on
the 17th of October, when the arrival of the police and military,
and some injudicious acts by a few bystanders, led to a collision
with the police, the reading of the Riot Act, and the burning of
the hotel. Some of the diggers were arrested, and one was rescued
on the way to the Camp. Milne, Sergeant-Major of police, a man
held in general execration as an unprincipled informer, was
regarded as the right hand of the officials in that business.</p>
<p>The subjoined extracts are from contributions to the
<i>Ballarat Star</i>, by Mr Samuel Irwin, a gentleman who was an
eye-witness of the time and a daily recorder for the Press of
what transpired. His letters to the <i>Geelong Advertiser</i> of
those days gave very full and, in the main, very accurate
descriptions of the occurrences of the time. So far may their
reliableness be assumed that not only have no material
contradictions been made, but, as the English Blue Books
demonstrate, Sir Charles Hotham adopted some of Irwin's letters
as portions of his despatches to the English Secretary for the
Colonies:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>As a matter of course, those who take an interest in
the past of Ballarat have in a great measure to fall back on
personal reminiscences, as but few of them have easy access to
documentary evidence, so that most of what can be said or written
under the circumstances partakes of the egotistical.<br>
<br>
A good deal has been said of the means and persons by and through
whom Bentley got into the good graces of some of the leading
officials at the Camp. Little is positively known of the matter
beyond those immediately concerned, but any one who had heard the
tone in which Bentley asked a person standing one cold early
winter's day in the verandah of the Police-court, after the court
had closed, "Where is Mr. Dewes?" could hardly have failed to
note a more than usually free and easy manner on the part of the
equestrian questioner. The reply was civil&mdash;"In the
magistrate's room"&mdash;to which Bentley, dismounting, betook
himself with all the confidence of one who knew the locality
well. In a few minutes Mr. Dewes and his visitor, then an
applicant for a publican's license, appeared, and went into the
large tent, just opposite the Police-court where the former
resided.<br>
<br>
The license was in due time granted, the hotel was usually
crowded, the bowling-alley and the free use of cards contributing
among other inducements to attract a large number of customers,
almost in a continuous stream by night as well as by day. Knowing
the fact that the hotel was nearly always open, Scobie made for
it, found it closed, created a disturbance to gain admission, was
assaulted in consequence and died. The coroner's inquest which
followed was far from partaking of that strict scrutiny and
judicial aspect which on the whole are so characteristic of such
proceedings, and so the suspicion already existent as to the
purity of some of the camp officials became stronger. At length
the supposed participators in the death of Scobie were brought
before the Police-court, composed of Messrs. Dewes, P.M., Rede,
resident commissioner, and Johnston, commissioner. The prisoners,
in the opinion of the majority of the bench, were free from
blame, and were discharged, though Mr. Johnston, the junior,
dissented from the opinion of his seniors. He even was so decided
in opinion as to the guilt of the prisoners that he took a copy
of the depositions, forwarding them to Melbourne for the
consideration of the Attorney-General.<br>
<br>
It was decided to hold a public indignation meeting on the spot
where Scobie had met his death, to protest against the
miscarriage of justice, and to devise the ways and means for
bringing the delinquents to a fair trial. The meeting was held
and passed off quietly, though pretty strong language had been
used. The camp authorities, dreading an attack they said on
Bentley's hotel, but to provoke one asserted the discontented,
sent the police to act as a guard over the building. The usual
"chaff" was indulged in, and nothing serious was supposed to be
imminent on the part of the leaders among the discontented. But
it fell out otherwise. A youngster, one of the lads who used to
wash "headings" from rich claims, in the reckless unthinking
spirit of untamed boyhood, threw a stone at the lamp in front of
the hotel. The stone struck the lamp and broke the glass. This
was the spark which lighted the train. The long suppressed
indignation broke forth in one long terrific yell of
irrepressible indignation "down with the house, burn it." The
demolition of the windows was effected in a moment, and the sound
of the crashing glass added still more to the excitement of all
present, even of those who either from disinclination for such
work, or by reason of the intervening crowd, could not join in
it. The house was soon occupied, the people swarming into it by
door or window as came most conveniently to hand. Some of the
camp officials who had still managed to keep some faith in their
honesty in the popular breast&mdash;notably Mr. Commissioner
Amos, who was drowned in the London, aided by Mr. M'Intyre, who
subsequently was rewarded for having done this, by being arrested
for having been an aider and abettor in the riot&mdash;tried all
their persuasive powers to calm the excited and now well-nigh
frantic assemblage. It was labor in vain. The long gathering
hurricane had burst, and must career until its fury had been
spent. In a few minutes the cry was that the rear or side of the
premises towards the bowling alley was in flames. And so it was,
but who caused the fire is among the secrets of that
day.</blockquote>
<p>How it should have been a secret seems remarkable if the
description given by the <i>Argus</i> correspondent be
considered. His narrative may, in the absence of a statement to
the contrary, be taken as given by an eye-witness, He
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>About half-past two or three o'clock in the
afternoon, and when the crowd had increased to about 8,000 or
10,000, a man carried an armful of paper and rags to the windward
end of the bowling-alley, and placing them under the calico
covering, deliberately struck a match and fired the building in
the presence of the military. The cool, resolute manner in which
everything was carried on resembled more the proceedings of the
"Porteous mob" than of anything of the kind that has occurred
since.</blockquote>
<p>Contrasting with present rapidity of communication, the tardy
publication of the Bentley hotel burning in the towns on the
seaboard is notable. The disturbance and burning happened on the
12th October, but it was not mentioned in the <i>Argus</i> till
the 19th, and then only in a letter from Geelong dated the 18th,
and saying the news had been "just received". The Ballarat
correspondent of the <i>Argus</i> seems to have acted with
considerable deliberation, for he did not write till the 18th,
his letter appearing on the 23rd. To make the deliberation more
judicial by contrast with facts, the letter began with the words,
"the exciting events, &amp;c."</p>
<p>Irwin's narrative continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>During the earlier stage of the proceedings it was
evident that the owner of the hotel might not expect much mercy
at the hands of those present, and he was therefore easily
persuaded to mount a fleet horse provided for him, and make his
way to the Camp, where he ensured his personal safety, and gave
word that more assistance was needed by the authorities at the
hotel. The hurried progress of the refugee messenger, as he sped
along the main road coatless, if not hatless, spread the
excitement among those at work on the Gravel Pits Lead, and they
also soon added their numbers to the already large and vast
increasing multitude. The quick march of soldiers from the Camp
soon after Bentley's arrival showed the urgency of the case, and
ere they had gained the foot of Bakery Hill, scarcely a man was
on the Gravel Pits, save some miner whose excited fellows had
forgotton that he was "below", or some storekeeper who could not
procure a temporary caretaker for his goods.<br>
<br>
It may be superstitious or otherwise to mention it, but it is
nevertheless the fact that, just as the military entered Specimen
Gully, while the force of the breeze had fashioned the flames
from the ridge-board of the yet standing but wholly ignited roof
into a fiery coombe or crest, a small black cloud rested over the
Black Hill, and a few scattered heavy drops of rain fell.
Possibly the excitement was so intense that but few noticed the
occurrence. The rain-drops ceased, the cloud
disappeared&mdash;the breeze lulled, and with a crash down fell
the only yet standing portion of Bentley's hotel.<br>
<br>
With the now well ascertained opinions of Sir Charles Hotham on
subordination, it may be readily imagined that he was furious at
this open revolt against the law and fully bent on avenging the
outrage. He had plenty of willing tools ready to his hands, men
who, to use the words of one of his class, "would swear a hole
through an iron pot" to oblige a friend. They at lust picked out
three scape-goats. One was M'Intyre, now in comfortable
circumstances in Glasgow, who had used his best endeavours to
restrain the crowd at Bentley's from overt acts. Another was
Fletcher, a printer, whose office was on the Main road, not far
on the Eastern Market side of Twentyman and Stamper's. Fletcher,
from all that can be learned, was not off the Main road the day
of the fire, and certainly was not farther than the Prince Albert
hotel in that direction. Westerby, the third man, has been
asserted to be equally innocent with Fletcher in the
transaction.<br>
<br>
A meeting was held, and a committee was suggested to bail the
prisoners. J.F. Coleman (now mining registrar at Staffordshire
Reef,) volunteered to act, and his example being speedily
followed the number that had been named&mdash;nine&mdash;was soon
got together. Some had advised that the meeting proceed to the
Camp and release the prisoners by force. A milder course,
however, was adopted, and the committee went to the Camp and
offered bail. After enquiry bail was accepted. All this took
time, and the crowd, which had promised not to come nearer the
Camp than already stated, had crept up, first to the Yarrowee
Creek, and finally to the brow of the hill in front of the
present Mining Board-room. The police had been drawn up on the
higher ground to meet this body of men as they came towards the
Camp. Experience had taught the Camp to be on the alert, and the
whole force there was well in hand to prevent a second riot.
While the bailbonds were being prepared, the angry hum of the
crowd outside was distinctly heard inside the Police-court, and
at one time the magistrates seemed to think the giving bail was
but a ruse to temporarily distract the Camp, and, during a riot,
release the prisoners by force. Fortunately the bail was
concluded, and the committee with M'Intyre appeared. But a new
difficulty was in store. In the anxiety to reach M'Intyre the
crowd pressed forward, and, being kept back by the police, a
collision would have been inevitable but that M'Intyre was
hurried forward while the members of the committee spread their
arms and good naturedly pressed their friends backwards.
Returning down the Main road, revolvers were drawn and fired in
defiance of the authorities. One of the revolvers went off in the
excitement before its owner had raised the barrel over the heads
of the crowd; in going off it somewhat seriously injured a man
walking on the left hand of the person carrying it. Among the
things advised was, now that M'Intyre was liberated, he should
take to hiding. The adviser of this step was Kennedy, and the
objector was one of the bondsmen, who happened to be present. To
M'Intyre's credit be it said he refused, apart from the
responsibilities of his bail, to hide for an hour. The trial and
conviction of the three prisoners followed, which brings us to
the celebrated demand for the release of the prisoners, made by a
deputation to Sir Charles Hotham.</blockquote>
<p>A meeting on Bakery Hill had adopted resolutions demanding the
release of the prisoners, the dismissal of Milne, and affirming
the right of the people to full representation, manhood suffrage,
no property qualification of members, payment of members, short
Parliaments, abolition of the gold-fields commission and the
diggers' and storekeepers' license fees. Messrs. Hayes, Humffray,
Holyoake, Black, Vern, Burke, Kennedy, and others were the
speakers, and Hayes was in the chair. There had been a commission
of enquiry into the Bentley hotel affair. The commissioners were
Captain Sturt, Dr. M'Crea, and the magistrate Dewes, and they had
closed their sittings on the day before the Bakery Hill meeting.
That commission was looked on with mistrust by the diggers
because of Dewes, whom, moreover, the Colonial Secretary, Mr.
Foster, had dismissed, or suspended, as a sop to the enraged
population.</p>
<p>The commissioners went to Melbourne with their report. In
December the trial of Westerby, M'Intyre, and Fletcher, the
prisoners arrested for the burning of Bentley's hotel, was to
take place in Melbourne, to which place the <i>venue</i> had been
changed. Mr. Humffray prepared the briefs for their advocate.
Bentley had also, in the interim, been re-arrested for the murder
of Scobie, and had, with some associates in the affray that ended
in Scobie's death, been convicted. They were sentenced to three
years on the roads. The original acquittal was attributed mainly
to the medical evidence of Dr. A. Carr, who was regarded as a
colluding associate of both Dewes and Bentley. Solemn official
condemnation of the Police Magistrate confirmed the popular
denunciations of Dewes and some of his associates. Messrs. E.P.
Sturt, W. M'Crae, and F.A. Powlett, who had been appointed to
enquire into the matters connected with the hotel, and to report
on claims for compensation therewith connected, made the
following statement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Influenced by the fact that to the Police Magistrate,
and the misconduct of that public officer, may be attributed, in
a great measure, the riotous assembly which led to such
unfortunate results, your board are willing to recommend certain
of the sufferers by the burning of Bentley's hotel to a
consideration of their claims.</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Bentley had a bad record. The <i>Police Gazette</i> of the
23rd March, 1856, announces that a ticket of leave was granted to
"James Francis Bentley, a native of Surrey, born 1818, 5 feet 7
inches high, fair complexion, brown hair, grey eyes, medium
mouth, nose, and chin. Marks:-Mole on back of neck and light arm,
right foot mutilated. Ship Blundell to Norfolk Island, 1844,
sentence ten years. Tried at Melbourne Supreme Court 18th
November, 1854, and sentenced to three years hard labor for
manslaughter. Ticket of leave granted 18th March, 1850, for the
district of Heidelberg."</p>

<br>
<p>To have done with Dewes and Bentley, we may say here that
Dewes was not silent under the strokes of dismissal from the
service. In the <i>Ballarat Times</i>, published on the Sunday of
the Eureka action, on the 3rd December, 1851, there was a letter
addressed by him to the editor, in which he denied the
allegations of corrupt connection with any of the diggers, though
he pleaded guilty of "having mixed more with the intelligent
classes on the diggings than my predecessors, or many of my
contemporaries, were in the habit of doing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;
As on most occasions, affability of manner is a good substitute
for unmeaning hauteur, and were it not for the unfortunate affair
of 'Bentley, &amp;c.', no outcry would have been raised against
myself in my official capacity." Dewes also shot Parthian arrows
at his late colleagues in office.</p>
<blockquote>I cannot say, he writes, how far land speculations,
which often involve a complexity of interests, are compatible
with the purity of the bench (which, indeed, comprises the
greater part of the Camp officials, from the boy Gold
Commissioner to the more mature Police Magistrate), and most of
whom are land speculators. I can only assert that two out of the
three gentlemen who formed the board of investigation were such,
and that one of them had contracted a short time previously at
Ballarat precisely the same description of obligation as that so
severely commented on in my own case in the report of the
Board.</blockquote>
<p>"Read this, ye diggers," wrote the editor in a foot note, "and
judge for yourselves what justice you may expect." The "boy
commissioner" referred to was W.H. Foster, a young officer who
afterwards became a warden and police magistrate. Both he and C
Forster, governor of the gaol here for a time, claimed to be
related to the Latrobe family, both forms of the name coming
presumably, from the original vocational name Forrester.</p>
<p>On the 10th April, 1873, Bentley ended his career by laudanum
in Ballarat street, Carlton, the poor wretch even in death
having, as it would seem, chosen a place that had about it a
reminder of his goldfield's exploits. He was about 54 years old,
and left a wife and five children. The coroner's jury found that
he poisoned himself whilst of unsound mind, and the <i>Argus</i>
report of the inquest says he had bouts of drinking, poisoned
himself six months before, and had "never been quite right since
he lost his property at the Ballarat riots, and for the last two
years had never ceased to talk about it." Let us hope that
Scobie's ghost, so romantically referred to by one of the Eureka
orators one day, is at rest with his revenge now.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Rich, an old digger of the fifties, gives some
recollections of those days. He emerged some years ago from
canvas tents, shingled cottages, and the <i>res angustæ
dufferorum</i> <a name="FNanchor_07" id=
"FNanchor_07"></a><a href="#fn07" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a>&mdash;ah mercy! ye double firsts&mdash;and
took a voyage to his native cocaigne, returning thence with some
goodly thousands sterling and what is, perhaps, the best private
library of miscellaneous literature extant to-day in Ballarat. He
built one of the handsomest mansions in Drummond street north, as
became a descendant of a branch of the Cardinal Rich family of
the Tudor times, and one entitled to exhibit that interesting
specimen of heraldic ornithology&mdash;a wyvern. Mr. Rich was
educated partly in France, partly in England, and has read a
little law without being able, the author fears, to say whether a
beast&mdash;or a wyvern&mdash;"taken in withernam can be
replevied", but he is a quiet, shrewd observer. He
writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Mr. Scobie, the <i>prima causa</i> <a name=
"FNanchor_08" id="FNanchor_08"></a><a href="#fn08" class=
"fnanchor"><big>[8]</big></a> of the burning of Bentley's hotel, arrived in
this colony with a brother from Scotland, <i>via</i> London, in a
barque called the "Moselle", at Melbourne, towards the end of
1852 (Mr. Ellery, A.R. came by the same ship). He took up his
residence at Ballarat soon after, and opened up the gully in the
Buninyong road, now called Scotchman's after them. The brother
was afterwards a contractor at Ararat, where he died. On the day
of his murder he had met an old friend. In the course of their
peregrinations they called at Mr. Watkin's "Victoria" hotel,
Armstrong street, and was there recognised by Mrs. R.,
housekeeper to Mrs. Watkins, as her shipmate. He was usually a
very steady man, but carried away by the excitement of "auld lang
syne", he went beyond his usual abstemiousness, and returning
home to his tent, just beyond Bentley's on the "Eureka", called
there for "just ane wee drappie mair." The house was closed. The
landlord, being annoyed by his persistent knocking, came out and
dealt him an unlucky blow with some weapon too ready to his hand,
which was said to have quietened him for ever, but was to be the
cause afterwards of such evil results to Mr. Bentley. In
consequence of the apathy and partiality of the authorities the
Scotch residents of Ballarat, considering there had been a
miscarriage of justice, resolved to avenge the foul murder of
their countryman. Notices were placarded about the diggings
calling a meeting of Scotchmen on the site of Bentley's hotel,
which resulted in its destruction and preluded the catastrophe of
the Stockade. One afternoon, as I returned from work at White
Horse, when I arrived at the township, now Ballarat West, seeing
a fresh notice posted on a tree, I naturally stopped to read it,
(it was a caution to the public against carrying firearms and
concealed weapons) when one of the troopers parading the township
jumped off his horse, and without speaking a word thrust his
hands into my pockets, down the waist-band of my trousers, and
inside the breast of my shirt, tearing off the buttons and
totally disarranging my dress. I attempted to remonstrate, but
all in vain. I was peremptorily ordered to move on. So,
discomfited and upset, I had to yield to the <i>force
majeure</i>; <a name="FNanchor_09" id="FNanchor_09"></a><a href=
"#fn09" class="fnanchor"><big>[9]</big></a> and with curses not loud but
deep got within doors as quick as I could, pondering on this
treatment of a free-born Briton. One day, whilst crossing the
diggings at Golden Point to get to the Township to renew my
license, which had only just expired, I was stuck up by the
troopers who were then scouring the diggings for unlicensed
miners. Being quite taken by surprise I pretended to search my
pockets for the license and produced the old one, but luckily for
me I was accompanied by two mates who had licenses which were
<i>en règle</i>. <a name="FNanchor_10" id=
"FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#fn10" class="fnanchor"><big>[10]</big></a> They
represented to the trooper that through an oversight I had
omitted to renew, but that I was then going to the Camp to get a
fresh one. He let me pass, but we had not gone above one hundred
yards when we encountered Warden Webster. "Hillo, my men, show
your licenses!" I endeavoured to gain time as before, by
pretending to search for my license and showed the old one but
folded, and had just been called on to show it when the trooper
who had stopped me first rode up and called out "I have seen his
license, sir!" and thereby saved me from the fine and the logs. I
afterwards heard that if it had been discovered he had passed me
he would have been fined himself. We had invited him to meet us
down the road in the evening, but never saw him more. While
sitting at dinner one lovely Sunday afternoon I received notice
from Mr Watkins, the Government contractor, to join another young
Welshman in sinking an excavation to make a grave for the diggers
slain at the Stockade in the morning. We commenced digging the
grave and had been at it some three or four hours. As it was a
very large one we worked very hard, but before we had nearly
finished the mournful cavalcade arrived. In consequence of the
coffins being placed in two tiers, one above the other, they
reached to within a foot of the surface, four at bottom and three
at top, but we managed to cover them up by well banking the earth
above them. Whether they were afterwards displaced I never heard.
The coffins were very rudely made of ½ inch weatherboards, the
covers roughly nailed on, so that the bodies were plainly
discernible through the joints in the lids, and the limbs
appeared contracted and quite discolored by smoke and fire, for
the tents were burnt by the military who, when they captured the
Stockade, fired the encampments with hand grenades. Whilst
interring these unfortunates another procession entered the
cemetery conveying the body of a digger, a Welshman named
Rowlands, who had been shot by a trooper whilst entering his tent
after returning from work. The trooper called on him to stand,
and as he paid no attention shot him dead in his tracks. The body
was buried at no great distance from those of the
insurgents.</blockquote>
<p>The trial of the alleged incendiaries ended in a conviction,
and M'Intyre was sentenced to three, Fletcher to four, and
Westerby to six months' imprisonment. The jury had recommended
them to mercy, and, amid the applause of the bystanders in the
crowded court, declared their belief that the outrage had been
provoked by the improper conduct of the Ballarat officials. As to
those officials, however, it must be remembered that, besides
Dewes, there were Messrs. Johnston and Rede on the bench when
Bentley was examined, but Johnston not only voted for the
committal of the prisoner, but forwarded copies of the
depositions to the Attorney-General.</p>
<p>As soon as the conviction of Fletcher, M'Intyre, and Westerby
was known in Ballarat, the Reform League sent Messrs. Kennedy and
George Black to Melbourne to "demand" the release of the
prisoners. Black was then editor of the <i>Diggers Advocate</i>,
and wrote vigorously for the popular cause. Kennedy was a man of
rough, but moving eloquence. It was he who, at the meeting that
ended in the burning of Bentley's hotel, declared that the
murdered man's ghost was there yearning for revenge. As Saint
Buonaparte, with pious fervor, proclaimed an alliance between
Divine Providence and heavy battalions, so Kennedy, at one of the
meetings of diggers, declared his preference of physical over
moral force by reciting the rugged but vigorous
couplet&mdash;</p>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:20%;">"Moral persuasion is
all a humbug,<br>
Nothing convinces like a lick in the lug!"</div>
<br>
<p>They reached Melbourne on the 25th November, Humffray, the
secretary of the League, having on the 23rd, been introduced by
Mr. Fawkner, M.L.C., to the Governor, who had intimated that if a
proper memorial were sent to the Government, the prisoners might
be released. The League secretary disapproved of the intemperate
"demand" brought down by the delegates. The Sunday was at hand
and the secretary and the delegates, and Mr. Ebenezer Syme, then
of the <i>Argus</i>, and afterwards of the <i>Age</i>, spent part
of the day discussing the position. Meanwhile, rumors of an
arrest of the delegates got current, the diggers at Ballarat
resolved on a monster meeting, and the camp officials sent
despatches for more troops. On Monday, the 27th November, the
delegates and Humffray waited on Sir Charles Hotham, to present
the remonstrant petition. His Excellency was attended by the
Attorney-General, Mr. (now Sir William) Stawell, and the Colonial
Secretary, Mr. Foster. The "demand" was refused, but reforms were
promised, and were said to be already begun. It is worthy of
record that in the course of the interview the delegates spoke of
the mode of alienating the Crown lands as being inimical to the
interests of the poor man. Thus early had begun our not yet ended
troubles in land administration. The excitement in Ballarat now
grew intenser, and the towns on the seaboard were alarmed with
rumors of insurrection. On the eve of the 28th, Mr. Tarleton, the
American consul, was feted at a banquet in Ballarat, and while
the dinner was going on soldiers were arriving from Melbourne,
and a collision had taken place between the soldiers, troopers,
and diggers. All that night the diggers were busy preparing arms
and ammunition, the committee of the League sat night and day,
the Camp bristled with sentries, and an eventful morrow was
looked for.</p>
<p>In the Legislative Council, the Colonial Secretary, Mr.
Foster, in reply to a question from Mr. Fawkner, did not appear
to have realised the gravity of the crisis, and the <i>Argus</i>
of that day compared the Secretary to Nero fiddling while Rome
was burning. Yet, while the <i>Argus</i> was hounding Foster down
as the one "black-sheep", the diggers were hooting and groaning
at the <i>Argus</i> as a "turncoat", because that journal had
condemned some of the wild doings of the outraged population.
Foster was about the best abused man of the day, and he had
eventually to leave office before the storm of popular
indignation.</p>
<p>Reinforcements of horse and foot police were concentrated
about this time at the Camp from the neighbouring diggings,
together with detachments of the 12th and 40th Regiments of the
Line. On the 28th November the police were pelted, and the
military, entering from Melbourne by the Eureka, were attacked by
the diggers. The party in charge of the baggage was for a time
cut off, and some of the waggons were overturned and rifled by
the diggers in hope of finding fire-arms. In this, however, they
were disappointed. Several soldiers were wounded and a drummer
boy was shot in the thigh. The diggers followed the troops to the
vicinity of the Camp, when the mounted police made a sortie,
wounded several men, and drove back the crowd, the troops
entering quarters in a panic-stricken and exhausted state at
eleven o'clock at night. All night long the diggers kept fires
burning, and made the night hideous with discharges of fire-arms
and other noises. The military encampment was on the slope
afterwards known as Soldiers' Hill, now forming part of the north
ward of the City of Ballarat. The attack upon the troops took
place in the Warrenheip gully, within a few hundred yards of the
spot where, a day or two later, the insurgent diggers erected
their Stockade. The onslaught upon the troops appears to have
been unprovoked and savage, and it excited general disgust in the
minds of the colonists everywhere out of Ballarat. At Ballarat,
also, the larger portion of the inhabitants regarded the affair
as alike inopportune and disgraceful. Indeed, the recognised
leaders of the reform movement up to that time appear to have
known nothing of the collision until it was actually over.
Raffaello, a writer whom we shall refer to again, calls it a
"cowardly attack". In illustration of the fact that the general
body of the diggers sought only the rights of freemen, and were
not marauders or revolutionists, it may be stated that when the
Government Camp at Creswick was almost emptied of both officers
and men for the support of the authorities at Ballarat, hundreds
of the diggers offered their services to Mr. Commissioner Taylor
for the protection of the gold deposited at the Camp.</p>
<p>A monster meeting was called by the League for the 29th of
November, on Bakery Hill, at which some thousands were expected
from Creswick, besides delegates from all the other gold-fields.
For the movement had now become general, and emissaries had been
sent all over the colony to enlist sympathy, procure help, and,
in fact, make the rising national if not revolutionary. Henry
Holyoake, brother of the notable English Secularist, had been
sent to Bendigo to raise the diggers there, but he learned at
Creswick of the discomfiture of Lalor's force at the Stockade,
and his martial occupation being thereby gone, he retired till
more tranquil times arrived. At the meeting of the 29th, Humffray
and the delegates Black and Kennedy gave ill their report of the
conference with the Governor. Raffaello says Lalor never
addressed a meeting before that held on Bakery Hill on the 29th
November, when he made his first speech in moving the calling of
a meeting of the League for the next Sunday to choose a central
committee,&mdash;the Sunday when the attack on the Stockade
caused the collapse of all the physical force schemes then
afloat. Some 12,000 men, it is said, were present at the meeting
on Bakery Hill. A platform was erected, and on a flagstaff was
hung the insurgent flag&mdash;the Southern Cross. The flag had a
blue ground, on which, in silver, the four principal stars of the
constellation of the Southern Cross were shown. Hayes was again
the chairman, and the site of the meeting was on and adjoining
the area now occupied by Victoria street, between East and
Humffray streets. Besides the Committee of the League and the
delegates, there were reporters on the platform, and two Roman
Catholic priests&mdash;the Rev. Fathers Downing and Smyth. The
Catholic Bishop of Melbourne, Dr. Goold, had also come to
Ballarat to help to maintain peace. The delegates spoke, and
Humffray, who still counselled moral force only, was denounced as
a trimmer. He was also denounced for having waited upon the
Government without authority from the League. A person named
Fraser, among the crowd, also advised constitutional action,
"and," says the <i>Ballarat Times</i>, "were it not for the
influence of the chairman and his numerous supporters, the man
would have been torn limb from limb by the infuriated people."
How the people felt, and what they did and resolved to do, will
best be gathered from the following resolutions, which were
adopted unanimously, although the Rev. Mr. Downing proposed an
amendment against the burning of the licenses:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Proposed by Mr. Reynolds, seconded by Mr.
Weekes&mdash;1. "That this meeting views with the hottest
indignation the daring calumny of his honor the Acting Chief
Justice, while on the bench, of the brave and struggling
sufferers of Clare, Tipperary, Bristol, and other districts, on
their endeavors to assert their legitimate rights; and do hereby
give the most unmitigated and the most emphatic denial to the
assertions of his honor in stigmatising as riots the persevering
and indomitable struggles for freedom of the brave people of
England and Ireland for the last eighty years."<br>
<br>
Proposed by Mr. Lalor, seconded by Mr. Brady&mdash;2. "That a
meeting of the members of the Reform League be called at the
Adelphi Theatre next Sunday, at 2 p.m., to elect a central
committee, and that each fifty members of the League have power
to elect one member for the central committee."<br>
<br>
Proposed by Mr. Frederick Vern, seconded by Mr. Quinn&mdash;3.
"That this meeting, being convinced that the obnoxious
license-fee is an imposition and an unjustifiable tax on free
labor, pledges itself to take immediate steps to abolish the
same, by at once burning all their licenses. That in the event of
any party being arrested for having no licenses, the united
people will, under all circumstances, defend and protect
them."<br>
<br>
Proposed by Mr. G. Black, seconded by Mr. Whatley&mdash;4. "That
as the diggers have determined to pay no more licenses, it is
necessary for them to be prepared for the contingency; as it
would be utterly inconsistent, after refusing to pay a license,
to call in a Commissioner for the adjustment of such disputes,
and this meeting resolves whenever any party or parties have a
dispute, the parties so disputing shall each appoint one man. The
two men thus appointed to call in a third, and these three to
decide the case finally."<br>
<br>
Proposed by Mr. Murnane, seconded by Mr. Ross&mdash;5. "That this
meeting will not feel bound to protect any man after the 10th
December who shall not be a member of the League by that
day."<br>
<br>
Proposed by Mr. Humffray, seconded by Mr. Kennedy&mdash;6. "That
this meeting protests against the common practice of bodies of
military marching into a peaceable district with fixed bayonets,
and also any force, police or otherwise, firing on the people,
under any circumstances, without the previous reading of the Riot
Act, and that if Government officials continue to act thus
unconstitutionally, we cannot be responsible for similar or worse
deeds from the people."</blockquote>
<p>Bonfires were made of licenses, guns and revolvers were
discharged, and League-tickets of membership were issued to the
crowd. Troops were under arms in the gully beneath the Camp all
the time in readiness for an outbreak.</p>

<div class="dropcap"><img alt="" src=
"1304971h-images/Drop05.jpg"></div>
<div>A L L A R A T has not been famous alone for its golden
wealth. It has historical fame also, as the site of the
collision, in the year 1854, between the Queen's troops and armed
diggers at the Eureka Stockade. All the gold-fields of Victoria
were moved by discontent under grievances, both legislative and
administrative, during the period anterior to the affair at the
Eureka; but the resistance to the authorities culminated at
Ballarat. The general grievances were heightened there by some
particular incidents. These were, in effect, but the occasion
under the impulse of which a section of the mining population
sought violently to enforce complaints which derived their
gravity from other causes. All the grievances afterwards
redressed would have been redressed without the bloodshed at the
Eureka Stockade; but that tragical event intensified the momentum
of the crisis. It exemplified the rashness of a few diggers, and
the greater blunders of the Government, but it also expedited the
reforms which were eagerly desired by the whole population. If
the armed insurgents who were attacked by the soldiers on the
memorable Sunday morning in December, 1854, were wanting in the
calm sagacity which has always won reform under British rule,
they were for the most part not wanting in personal courage, and
the result of their policy, as we have intimated, did certainly
hasten the coming of those reforms whose fruits the whole colony
now enjoys. For all this, then, let the gold-fields men who fell
at the Stockade be honored. They stood up, with their lives in
their hands, for freedom; and in that we may well forgive the
mistakes they committed, and the follies they purposed. Of the
soldiers who fell, their record is in the roll of the army whose
traditions are a history of which the race is proud.</div>
<br>
<p>With incredible want of prudence the authorities chose the
juncture, marked by the meeting of the 29th November, for a more
irritating display than usual of the so-long condemned practice
of "digger hunting". On the 30th November the last raid of this
kind in Victoria occurred, under the direction of Commissioners
Rede and Johnston, and the authorities by that act destroyed the
remaining influence of the friends of moral force action among
the diggers. The police, supported by the whole military force
available, with skirmishers in advance and cavalry on the Hanks,
formed on the flat south of the Camp and advanced upon the Gravel
Pits, as the Bakery Hill diggings were called. This cleared the
swarming crowd of diggers collected there, the diggers retiring
as the troops advanced. At certain parts of the Main road,
however, the diggers made a stand, and received the troops with a
running fire of stones and occasional gun-shots. The troops took
some prisoners and returned to Camp, and soon after that the
Southern Cross flag was again hoisted on Bakery Hill; the diggers
knelt around the flag, swore mutual defence, implored the help of
God, and then began to drill. New leaders came to the front, as
the advocates of moral force were discomfited by the authorities
and the more turbulent insurgents. Peter Lalor, a native of
Queen's County, Ireland, a son of the one time member of the
House of Commons for the same county, was chosen
"commander-in-chief" of the insurgents, and issued warrants and
manifestos. A fiery-spirited Italian, named Carboni Raffaello,
was another who then acquired prominence. He afterwards wrote a
quaint polyglottic book, entitled "The Eureka Stockade: The
Consequence of some Pirates Wanting on Quarterdeck a Rebellion."
We shall meet with him presently. Irwin, in his communications to
the <i>Ballarat Star</i>, says with respect to this last
digger-hunt,&mdash;and he speaks nearly always as an eye-witness
and often as an actor in the business:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>By the time that the camp authorities had retired,
the men from the Eureka arrived, a good many of them. Lalor among
the rest, being armed. A short consultation took place, all work
was suspended, and the Southern Cross flag was hoisted on Bakery
Hill. The popular indignation was intense. A mass meeting Mas
held on Bakery Hill, where Lalor, gun in hand, mounted the stump
and swore in his followers. The method of swearing-in was by
uplifting the right hand, and was very impressive as taken by the
hundreds who encircled their leader. Immediately after the
swearing-in the names were taken down, and the men formed into
squads for drill. The drilling was kept up with but little
intermission to a late hour, and was now and then renewed up to
the capture of the Stockade. As might naturally be anticipated,
the Government had its emissaries among the insurgents, and but
little was said or done which was not soon reported to the
authorities. Immediately after the soldiers, &amp;c., had retired
to the Camp on 30th November, two or three members of the
committee met in the committee-room at the Star hotel, and wrote
a letter to the delegates who had gone that day to Creswick. The
letter detailed the occurrences of the day, and solicited the aid
of the miners of Creswick, and was directed to the delegates by
name "or any man on Creswick." When the messenger arrived at
Creswick he gave the letter to Black, and he read it to a large
meeting he was addressing. It was immediately determined to
render the required assistance, and a large body of men, headed
by Kennedy, started for Ballarat, taking the direct way through
the ranges. Kennedy was armed with a sword, and some of those who
accompanied him from Creswick give an extraordinary account of
how he flourished the sword about his head and speechified to his
followers during a violent thunderstorm that happened that night.
The Creswick contingent gradually dwindled away as they had but
indifferent accommodation, and the majority of those who still
remained left for home on the evening before the capture of the
Stockade.</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Melbourne Herald</i> correspondent states that the
Creswick men marched out with a band, or singing the song "The
Marseillaise". It was but a straw, but it showed how the current
of men's thoughts and feelings was flowing.</p>
<p>Carboni Raffaello, in his book, shows that he had had a
liberal education, and was gifted with a warm poetic temperament,
with considerable shrewdness of observation and faculty for
description. But he lacked discretion sometimes, and he seemed to
be always perplexed with suspicions and mysteries, besides being
oddly egotistical. He is sometimes a mystery himself, and, in his
style, often amusingly incoherent, but his narrative has color
and fire and incisiveness, and will make itself read. He hits off
a man with a few sharp touches that live in the mind's eye. Here
is one, a portrait of Kennedy:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Thomas Kennedy was, naturally enough, the lion of the
day. A thick head, bold, but bald, the consequence perhaps not of
his dissipation, but of his worry in bygone days. His merit
consists in the possession of the chartist slang; hence his
cleverness in spinning a yarn, never to the purpose, but
blathered with long phrases and bubbling with cant. He took up
the cause of the diggers, not so much for the evaporation of his
gaseous heroism, as eternally to hammer on the unfortunate death
of his countryman Scobie, for the sake of "auld lang
syne".</blockquote>
<p>Raffaello calls Irwin "a rattling correspondent, who helped to
hasten the movement fast enough." He gives the following picture
of the Catholic priest:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Father Patricius Smythe, a native of Mayo, looks some
thirty-five years old, and belongs to the unadulterated Irish
caste, half-curled hair, not abundant, anxious semicircular
forehead, keen and fiery eyes, altogether a lively interesting
head.</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Ballarat Times</i> of the day he calls "a plant of
cayenne pepper", and gives the following extract from that
journal of 18th November, 1854, interlarded in his peculiar style
with remarks of his own:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>We salute the League [but not the trio, Vern,
Kennedy, Humffray] and tender our hopes and prayers for its
prosperity [in the shape of a goodly pile of half-crowns]. The
League has undertaken a mighty task [the trio'll shirk it
though], fit only for a great people&mdash;that of changing the
dynasty of the country [Great works]. The League does not exactly
propose, nor adopt, such a scheme, but we know what it means, the
principles it would inculcate, and that eventually it will
resolve itself into an Australian Congress [Great
works!!].</blockquote>
<p>Here is Raffaello's account of the Leaguers' preparation for
the digger-hunt of the 30th November:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><i>Quos Vult Perdere </i>[<i>M</i>]<i>ens Dementat</i>. <a name=
"FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#fn11" class=

What's to be done? Peter Lalor was on the stump, his rifle in his
hand, calling on volunteers to "fall in" into ranks as fast as
they rushed to Bakery Hill, from all quarters, with arms in their
hands, just fetched from their tents. Alfred, George Black's
brother, was taking down in a book the names of divisions in
course of formation, and of their captains. I went up to Lalor,
and the moment he saw me, he took me by the hand saying, "I want
you, Signore; tell these gentlemen (<i>pointing to old
acquaintances of ours, who were foreigners</i>) that if they
cannot provide themselves with fire-arms, let each of them
procure a piece of steel, five or six inches long, attached to a
pole, and that will pierce the tyrants' hearts." Peter of course
spoke thus in his friendly way as usual towards me. He was in
earnest though. The few words of French he knows, he can
pronounce them tolerably well, but Peter is no scholar in modern
languages; therefore he then appointed me his aide-de-camp, or
better to say his interpreter, and now <i>I am proud to be his
historian</i>. Very soon after this, all the diggers "fell in" in
file of two abreast, and marched to the Eureka. Captain Ross, of
Toronto, was our standard-bearer. He hoisted down the Southern
Cross from the flagstaff, and headed the march. Patrick Curtain,
the chosen captain of the pikemen, gave me his iron pike, and
took my sword to head his division; I "fell in" with John
Manning, who also had a pike, and all of us marched in order to
the Eureka. I assert as an eye-witness, that we were within one
thousand in the rank with all sort of arms, down to the pick and
shovel. We turned by the Catholic church, and went across the
gully. Of this I have perfect recollection: when the "Southern
Cross" reached the road, leading to the Eureka on the opposite
hill, the file of two abreast crossing the gully, extended
backwards up to the hill where the Catholic church stands. I took
notice of the circumstance at the time. We reached the hill where
was my tent. How little did we know that some of the best among
us had reached the place of their grave! Lalor gave the proper
orders to defend ourselves among the holes in case the hunt
should be attempted in our quarters. The red-tape was by far too
cunning this time; red-coats, traps, and troopers had retired to
the Ballarat Camp, and wanted a "spell". We determined, however,
to put an end to their accursed license-hunting, mock riot-act
chopping, Vandemonian shooting down our mates in
Gravel-pits.</blockquote>
<p>Vern is always ridiculed as a vain, boasting, "long-legged,
sky-blathering Vern". Lalor he loves as "he is the earnest,
well-meaning, no two-ways, non-John-Bullised Irishman," wherefore
"more power to you, Peter, old chummy! Smother the knaves! they
breed too fast in this colony." Of the meeting on the 30th
November, he says Lalor administered the oath to some 500 armed
diggers, as follows:&mdash;"We swear by the Southern Cross to
stand truly by each other, and fight to defend our rights and
liberties." Dr. Kenworthy, Raffaello seems to regard, as did many
more, as a go-between with the Camp authorities and the diggers.
He was, in fact, regarded as a spy.</p>
<p>As soon as the news of these doings reached Melbourne, the
Government sent up all the remaining available troops, with
men-of-warsmen, horse and foot police, four field-pieces, and a
number of baggage and ammunition waggons. Lieut.-Colonel Valiant,
and subsequently Sir Robert Nickle, Commander-in-Chief of the
Forces, and Colonel Macarthur, Deputy Adjutant-General, proceeded
to Ballarat in command of the troops. The diggers who drilled
under <i>their</i> commander-in-chief, meant, many of them at
least, nothing less than revolution and a republic. Lalor had a
"minister of war", named Alfred Black, who, or his brother, had
drawn up a Declaration of Independence. This was drawn up in a
store kept by one Shannahan; Black, Vern, M'Gill, Raffaello,
Curtin, Lessmann (a German), Kenworthy (an American medical man),
and others being present. Black was subsequently killed while
working as a quartz miner. Lalor having been, to Vern's disgust,
elected Commander-in-Chief, "orders of war" were issued by him
for arms, ammunition, and impressment, and he sent out piquets to
enforce them, and prevent their being made a cover for robbery.
It appears, however, that ammunition was not abundant in the
Stockade, the foraging parties of the insurgents to the contrary
notwithstanding. A pistol was picked up in the Stockade loaded
with powder and quartz pebbles, in lieu of hall or smaller shot,
showing, as may be assumed, that the diggers were not rich in the
usual materials of destruction. One of the foragers' receipts for
H military levy read as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Received from the Ballarat Store 1 Pistol, for the
Comtee X. Hugh M'Carty&mdash;Hurra for the people.
Another:&mdash;The Reform Lege Comete&mdash;4 Drenks, fouer
chillings; 4 Pies for fower of thee neight watch
patriots.&mdash;X.P.</blockquote>
<p>The night watch patriots were some of the insurgents told off
to patrol the diggings, for now there was, <i>de facto</i>, civil
war. The Government authorities were in a fortified camp on the
western plateau, and the insurgents were organising and
fortifying on the eastern grounds. Before us lies the tattered
remnant of a triple receipt given by the subscribers to the firm
of Bradshaw and Salmon, then carrying on business in the Main
road, Ballarat East. It will be seen that Esmond, the gold
discoverer, was one of the foragers for ammunition, the time
being imminent when a deadly use was to be made of the materials
collected. Mr. Leake, from whom we receive the document, and who,
later, had joined Bradshaw's firm, writes:&mdash;"I cannot call
to mind much about the matter, only I have a distinct
recollection of Mr. Moran threatening to shoot me if I did not
'hand over quick', and I have very little doubt my life would
have been taken that night only for Esmond." The "patriots" were
getting stern and peremptory as the times got bracing. But Esmond
was not one of the most fiery of the insurgent officers, and he
appears to have had a memory for friends as well as a sense of
what was judicious. He once rescued Irwin, the correspondent of
the <i>Geelong Advertiser</i>, who, writing of Esmond and himself
in the following passage says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>One night, that of Friday, 1st of December, a
gentleman who had occasion to go down the Main road, when he came
in front of the old Charlie Napier hotel, found some hundred men
drawn up two deep there. Passing down the one side of the men, he
sought to discover if he had any acquaintance among them. Not
having found one he passed up the other side, until he arrived
where the person, a lieutenant, who was in charge stood. The
gentleman being unknown to any of the party, was asked his
business there, and his account of himself not being deemed
satisfactory he was arrested, to be subsequently conveyed to head
quarters to be dealt with. It soon transpired that the captain of
the detachment, with a few men, was in the hotel searching for
arms, and that he was momentarily expected to come out. When he
did come out he spoke to the prisoner, who was an old and
intimate friend, and, not knowing that he was under arrest, asked
him to go into the hotel and have a drink. The lieutenant began
to fidget. The explanation was soon made, the misunderstanding
being got over by the lieutenant, under a threat from the captain
of having him arrested, going into the hotel when he, the
captain, the late prisoner, and one or two more came to a better
understanding while drinking a few glasses of
champagne.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the 1st December&mdash;says, in 1870, a Government
officer who was in the Camp at the time of the Stockade
affair&mdash;the Government took final measures to meet assault.
Every Government employé was armed and told off to his post, and
sentinels and videttes were placed at several points. The
principal buildings of the Camp, including the present Mining
Boardroom, in Camp street, were fortified with breastworks of
firewood, trusses of hay, and bags of corn from the commissariat
stores, and the women and children were sent for security into
the store, which was walled with thick slabs, and accounted
bullet-proof. A violent storm of rain, with thunder, commenced as
these arrangements were completed, and the mounted police, soaked
through with the rain, spent the night standing or lying by their
horses, armed, and horses saddled ready for instant action. At 4
a.m. on Saturday, 2nd December, the whole garrison was under
arms, and soon after daylight a demonstration in force was made
towards Bakery Hill without opposition. We heard to-day that the
insurgents were visiting the outlying stores and demanding arms.
Bodies of men are seen drilling near the Red Hill. No work is now
carried on throughout the entire diggings, and every place of
business is closed. [Taken, evidently, from a diary.] A mounted
trooper from Melbourne with despatches was fired at near the
Eureka line, where, through the information of spies, it is known
that a stockade is being erected.</blockquote>

<br>
<p>To this pass had the gold discovery, "digger hunting", and
irresponsible government brought the place where less than four
years before there was nothing but pastoral silence and solitude.
The Eureka stockade was at first intended more as a screen behind
which the diggers might drill than as a fortification. It was an
area of about an acre, rudely enclosed with slabs, and situated
at the point where the Eureka Lead took its bend by the old
Melbourne road, now called Eureka street. In the picture
published at the <i>Ballarat Star</i> office, near twenty years
ago, the middle of a line drawn from Mount Warrenheip, in the
centre back ground, to the chimney from which smoke is issuing on
the right of Sturt street, would indicate very nearly the site of
the Stockade. The site, as is shown on the map herewith, lay
about midway between what are now Stawell and Queen streets on
the east and west, and close to Eureka street on the south. At
the time of the fight the lead had not then been traced so far,
but the "shepherds" were there with their shallow pits, and one
or two claims were sinking. The Stockade included some of those
holes, as well as some diggers' tents, where the staff and other
officers and men of the insurgent force had their quarters. Pikes
were forged in the Stockade, and arms and ammunition had been
largely collected. Several companies of riflemen and pikemen were
formed, and a military insurgency established. The mass of the
diggers did not support this armed resistance, but friends, and,
it is said, enemies also, dropped into the Stockade at all hours
of the day and night of Saturday the 2nd of December. Friendly
butchers brought cart-loads of beef to the rendezvous, and
Lalor's men lay about the fires cooking, burnishing arms, or
engaged in other warlike business. Lalor, it is said, gave
"Vinegar Hill" as the night's pass-word, but neither he nor his
adherents expected that the fatal action of Sunday was coming,
and some of his followers, incited by the sinister omen of the
pass-word, abandoned that night what they saw was a badly
organised and not very hopeful movement. Father Smyth and Messrs.
Kennedy and George Black were in the Stockade during the
Saturday, and heard a project made to assault the Camp, it being
declared that 2000 diggers could be got for the purpose, and the
Camp easily taken. The three persons just mentioned did what they
could to dissuade from the proposed attack on the Camp, and so
left the Stockade. Mr. Budden, J.P., a Canadian, and a
school-fellow of Ross, heard of the approach of the troops and
police on the Sunday morning, and hastened from his tent near the
Stockade to advise Ross to withdraw from the hopeless struggle.
Challenged by the insurgent sentries, Budden succeeded at length
in getting within the Stockade and endeavored to prevail on Ross
to leave the place, warning him that the Government force was
approaching and that resistance would be useless and fatal. Ross,
however, refused to desert his comrades. The firing soon began,
Budden escaped by precipitate flight to his tent, and Ross was
fatally injured. All the day, on Saturday, Lessmann was out, by
Lalor's orders, in quest of a horde of vagabonds who were using
the name of Lalor's "minister of war" as a cover to thievish
raids upon storekeepers and others. Lessmann's and other outposts
of night videttes were off duty just before daybreak on the 3rd,
no attack being anticipated, but Lalor, Ross, Vern, M'Gill, and
other leaders were there.</p>
<p>We will now let the Government officer speak again from the
Government Camp.</p>
<blockquote>Before daylight on the 3rd December a force,
consisting of 276 men of all arms, including a strong body of
cavalry, mustered quietly and left camp with the purpose of
attacking the Stockade. At early dawn they reached the
neighborhood of the position sought, and the advanced files were
fired at by a sentinel posted within the Stockade. The order of
attack was now given, and the detachment of the 40th Regiment,
led by Captain Thomas, the chief officer in command, made a quick
advance upon the double breastwork which formed the stronghold of
the insurgents. After several vollies had been fired on both
sides, the barrier of ropes, slabs, and overturned carts was
crossed, and the defenders driven out, or into the shallow holes
with which the place was spotted, and in which many were put to
death in the first heat of the conflict, either by bullets or by
bayonet thrusts. The foot police were first over the barricade,
and one, climbing the flagstaff under a heavy fire, secured the
rebel flag. After burning all the tents within the enclosure, and
in the immediate vicinity, the troops returned to camp, and carts
were sent out for the dead and wounded. The latter thus obtained
immediate medical aid. They were covered with blood, and were
mostly shot in the breast. The number of insurgents killed is
estimated at from thirty-five to forty, and many of those brought
in wounded afterwards died. Of the troops, three privates were
killed, and several wounded, one of whom died. Two officers were
wounded, and one, Captain Wise, died. Among the arms taken in the
fight were pikes of a rude construction, made on the spot, and
furnished with a sort of hooked knife to cut the bridles of the
cavalry. The dead were buried the same day in the cemetery. The
bodies of the insurgents, placed in rough coffins made hurriedly,
were laid in a separate grave, the burial service being performed
by the clergyman to whose congregation they belonged. At night we
were again under arms, as constant rumours of an intended attack
kept us on the alert. This is exhausting work, and a severe
trial, especially for the military, as the men have had no rest
for several nights. Indeed, no one within the lines has undressed
for the last four nights at the very least.<br>
<br>
4th December.&mdash;The funerals of several of those who fell at
the Stockade and were removed by their friends, took place
to-day. They were attended by several hundred men, who marched
three abreast up the Main road and past the Camp, during which
the garrison was under arms. 7 p.m.&mdash;A number of insurgents,
favored by a clouded moon, crept up under cover of the nearest
tents beyond the palisade, and fired from several points upon the
sentinels. This caused a sudden alarm, everyone flew to his post,
and a general discharge took place, resulting, as was believed,
though erroneously as to the deaths, in the death of a woman and
a child in one of the tents, and in the wounding of three men on
the road adjoining, who unfortunately happened to be passing at
the time. One of these was brought in from the road in front of
the mess-house (now Mining Board-room), and died a few days
after.<br>
<br>
5th December.&mdash;This afternoon, to our great joy, the advance
guard of the relief from Melbourne, commanded by Major-General
Sir Robert Nickle was seen defiling from the ranges, and soon
after, the whole body, escorted by squadrons of cavalry, and
accompanied by a seemingly endless string of baggage-waggons
traversed the diggings, and piled arms within the lines. This
force consists of 800 men, together with a large party of sailors
from H.M.S. Electra, and four field pieces.<br>
<br>
6th December.&mdash;The district is placed under martial law, and
in obedience to a General Order, the inhabitants have brought in
a large quantity of fire-arms.<br>
<br>
9th December.&mdash;The General attended to-day at a tent
specially erected on the flat below the Camp, to swear in special
constables; but with, as I believe, one solitary exception, no
one came forward to support the Government, and the object
failed. Nevertheless, the handful of persons assembled heartily
cheered for the British army. This was the period of the siege of
Sebastopol, the false rumor of the capture of which had just
arrived.<br>
<br>
22nd December.&mdash;Captain Wise was buried tins day with
military honors. Since the time when his death became known, many
flags throughout the diggings were lowered half-mast out of
respect to this officer, who had been stationed here previously,
in command of the enrolled pensioners, and was a general favorite
with the people.<br>
<br>
2nd January.&mdash;A soldier, who was shot in the face, died this
morning. All further apprehension of an outbreak having ceased,
the Major-General and staff, with a portion of the field train
and the navy, have returned to Melbourne, leaving about 800 men
in garrison to await eventualities. Confidence is being now
generally restored. The gold-field again presents its usual
thronged and lively aspect, and the streets of the township are
no longer deserted, or traversed by grim patrols of mounted
troopers.<br>
<br>
1st April.&mdash;The prisoners taken at the Stockade, and tried
in Melbourne, were acquitted on the charge of high treason, which
is considered a triumph to the popular cause. And thus terminated
the agitation which caused such loss of life and property to
those prosecuting mining and commercial operations on the
Ballarat gold-workings.</blockquote>
<p>Thus far goes the narrative of an intelligent eye-witness
within the Government Camp. He is evidently in error as to the
hour when shots were fired into the Camp on the night after the
affair at the Stockade. At 7 p.m. it would be daylight. The
statement as to the firing upon the Government Camp on the
evening of the 4th is traversed altogether by one who was here
then and long afterwards. He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The soldiers were not fired upon, though they might
report so to save themselves. The soldiers on guard on Soldiers'
Hill, being either in drink or strongly excited, wantonly and
savagely, without orders and without provocation, fired into the
Flat. They came rushing out of the large tent like madmen, firing
and re-loading, and firing again irregularly at the tents, not
even a corporal commanding them. They turned round and fired at
me two or three shots though they saw me in a different direction
from that whence the insurgents are said to have
fired.</blockquote>
<p>Some allowance must be made for the opinions formed by men in
sudden emergencies like this when general alarm prevailed. That
shots were exchanged between the Flat and the Government Camp
appears unquestionable.</p>
<p>As has been seen, the attack by the authorities was
unexpected, and thus both men of war and men of peace were found
within the Stockade, while insurgents were absent who would
otherwise have been present. There were over a hundred armed men
in the Stockade, including Lalor, the chief, and a company of
pikemen, and a company of musketeers, under Ross, Vern, Lynch,
and Esmond. James H. M'Gill, another loader, had been previously
absent on the ranges with some riflemen, ostensibly for the
purpose of opposing the troops expected from Melbourne. There
were diggers working at their claims also within the Stockade.
One of the captains under Lalor thus describes the
affair:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I was on guard and saw the military at the same time
that the alarm was given by a digger working on a brace hard by.
They were then at the point where the gully, running down from
the Stockade, joins the head of Specimen Gully. I called out to
Vern, and Vern called Lalor. We got under arms immediately, some
200 about. The first shot was fired from our party, and the
military answered by a volley at 100 paces distance. Then there
was a volley from the Stockade. The military sent out scouts on
foot, and the troopers surrounded the Stockade, the party on foot
being covered by the fire from the force posted on the high
ground in the rear of the Free Trade Hotel. Captain Wise led the
scouts on foot, who broke into the Stockade where Lalor was, on
the side fronting to Specimen Gully. They got in, and the firing,
and piking, and bayonetting went on, and the "rebels" got into
disorder and rushed into some tents and a blacksmith's shop on
one side of the Stockade. The troopers fired the tents, and the
rest of the military now came up. The sun had now risen, and
about twenty minutes had passed since the first shot was fired.
Then two soldiers appeared on the other, side with bayonets
fixed. Warden Amos' horse, which we had taken with the warden
before, was between me and them, and I fired my revolver. One
fell, and the other drew back. I then fired a second shot at the
soldiers, my men in the tent cheering at the time. I then said,
"I'm off", and wheeled round to go out of the Stockade, but met
some troopers and retreated, and ran into a butcher's shop close
by. The military had now taken the Stockade, and they took away
the prisoners they had. I was in the chimney, and so escaped, as
they did not search. Most of our men were Irishmen. The soldiers
now went off with their prisoners, and the Stockade, slabs,
tents, and all were on fire.</blockquote>
<p>The correspondent of the <i>Melbourne Herald</i> saw the
retreat of the military with their dead, wounded, and prisoners.
He says further:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I was attracted by the smoke of the tents burnt by
the soldiers, and there a most appalling sight presented itself.
Many more are said to have been killed and wounded, but I myself
saw eleven dead bodies of diggers lying within a very small space
of ground, and the earth was besprinkled with blood, and covered
with the smoking mass of tents recently occupied. Could the
Government but have seen the awful sight presented at Ballarat on
this Sabbath morning&mdash;the women in tears, mourning over
their dead relations, and the blood-bespattered countenances of
many men in the diggers' camp&mdash;it might have occurred to His
Excellency that "<i>prevention is better than
cure</i>."</blockquote>
<p>M'Combie, in his "History of Victoria", gives the following
account of the attack on the Stockade.</p>
<blockquote>On the night of the 1st December lights were observed
in the tents of the diggers; and signals were repeatedly
exchanged, and shots fired at the sentries, who were driven in.
The officer in command found a large number of insurgents
organising, drilling, and equipping themselves. The spies had
seen their leaders telling them off in companies, and heard one
of the commanders say to the people that those who had no other
arms should get an iron spike placed on a pole, as "that would
find the tyrants' hearts!" The officer in charge issued a public
notice that no light would be allowed after eight o'clock; that
no discharge of fire-arms would be tolerated upon any pretence;
and that persons disobeying these orders would be fired at. On
the same day Mr. Commissioner Amos arrived at the Camp at
Ballarat, with information that the diggers were occupying an
entrenched camp at the Eureka, in considerable force, with the
avowed intention of intercepting the troops under the
Major-General, then hourly expected to arrive from Melbourne.
During the whole of that day the insurgents had possession of the
diggings, and were busy levying contributions on all classes,
giving the orders of their "minister of war" in payment. The
officer in command prudently refrained from molesting any of
their detached parties. He was unable to attack the insurgents
during the day, as he could not leave a force behind to protect
the Camp, and resolved upon a night surprise. Circumstances
favored this bold attempt. The insurgents had not contemplated
any active measures on the side of the authorities until the main
body of troops and the commanding-officer had arrived. It was
Sunday morning, and a very great portion of them were away, and
those who remained had dined late, and some, no doubt, had drank
deep. They were surprised by the gallant commander of the Queen's
troops, Captain Thomas, who resolved to seize the favorable
opportunity of delivering a most effective blow against them. The
insurgents were posted in a very advantageous position, in a
fortified camp, or rather stockade, at the Eureka. It rested on a
gentle eminence, and was of considerable strength. The leaders
were, however, not very deeply skilled in military engineering,
for it was much too large, and was not protected by proper
bastions or outworks to aid the defenders in a general assault.
Under all disadvantages, the diggers would have repulsed the
military had the attack not been made at a time when it was
totally unexpected, and when the great body were absent. The
officer upon whom the responsibility of this enterprise rested
was Captain Thomas, and he planned and carried out the whole
affair with creditable ability and vigor. He was assisted by
Captain Pasley, R.E., who bravely advanced with the skirmishers
and directed the assault. The military were fortunate in having
Mr. Commissioner Amos to act as their guide; being well
acquainted with the locality, he led the troops to the exact spot
where the operations were to commence. The force under Captain
Thomas reached the ground just as the morning begun to dawn.
There were present 30 men of Her Majesty's force [40th], under
Lieutenants Hall and Gardyne; 70 mounted police, under
Sub-Inspectors Furnell, Langley, Chomley, and Lieutenant Cossack;
65 men of the 12th Regiment, under Captain Quendo [Queade] and
Lieutenant Paul; 87 men of the 40th Regiment, under Captain Wise
and Lieutenants Bowder [Bowdler] and Richards; 24 foot police,
under Sub-Inspector Carter; making a total of 100 mounted and 176
foot.<br>
<br>
When the body arrived at about 300 yards from the entrenchments
the detachments of the 12th and 40th Regiments extended in
skirmishing order; the mounted force moved to the left of the
position and threatened the flank and rear of the insurgents. The
main body now advanced boldly to the attack. We have no means of
ascertaining the exact number of men in the Stockade, but they
could not have out-numbered the Queen's force. They stood to
their arms manfully as soon as the alarm was sounded, and when
the military were at a distance of 150 yards they poured in a
tolerably effective fire upon them. The commanding-officer now
directed the order to fire to be sounded, and throwing in a
steady fire on the camp in front, the military advanced in
unbroken order, undaunted by the continuous discharge with which
the insurgents received them. As the troops were likely to be
severely handled, the reserves and foot police were now brought
up for the struggle; a sharp fight was kept up for some time,
but, in consequence of the ammunition becoming scarce amongst the
insurgents, their fire slackened, and in a few minutes the
military carried the entrenchment at the point of the bayonet.
The engagement lasted about twenty-five minutes; the rebel
leaders fought well, Mr. Peter Lalor having been wounded in the
breach and left for dead in the Stockade, and several others cut
down at their posts. The loss to the Queen's force was
considerable, including Captain Wise, who, in leading his men to
the attack, was severely wounded and died in a few days
afterwards; Lieutenant Paul was also severely wounded. The loss
among the insurgents was variously estimated, but there could not
have been fewer than thirty killed on the spot, and a great many
wounded. There were 125 prisoners taken in the Stockade. The
commander-in-chief of the "forces of the Republic of Victoria",
as they were styled, named Vern, a Hanoverian by birth, escaped,
and a reward of £500 was offered for his apprehension. Mr. Lalor,
the other leader, who fell within the Stockade, lost his right
arm in the engagement. On the Tuesday the troops under the
command of the Major-General arrived on Ballarat; and they were
not there a minute too soon, for a large body of insurgents were
in arms at Creswick. There can be no doubt, however, that the
victory at the Eureka had very much raised the spirits of those
who supported the Government, and in a corresponding degree
dispirited all connected with the insurgents, and the officer in
command unquestionably deserved credit. He exercised a wise
discretion in attacking them, instead of waiting until they
became the aggressors. Indeed, most of the colonists who were
unfavorable to the authorities, and their system of administering
the law on the diggings, were compelled to condemn this open
attempt to overthrow the Government. The Legislature Council,
then in session, presented an address of sympathy to his
Excellency, which was of the following tenor: that, having been
placed in a painfully embarrassing position since his arrival in
the colony, he was entitled to the sympathy and support of the
Legislature. Sir Charles Hotham was very far from inexperienced
in affairs of State importance. He was particularly happy in his
reply. The firm resolve to suppress the incipient revolution was
softened by the readiness with which he offered to redress those
grievances which the diggers had complained of. He said it would
be his constant endeavour to conduct the government with the
utmost possible temper; he said the time for military rule had
passed; but when there was an outbreak, and that caused by
foreigners&mdash;men who had not been suffered to remain in their
own country in consequence of the violence of their
character&mdash;then Englishmen must sink all minor differences
and unite to support the authorities. The Government, however,
fared rather differently when a direct appeal was made to the
people. A public meeting had been called by requisition, to
consider the best means for protecting the city during the crisis
at the diggings. The principal agitators in this matter seemed to
be the members of the Legislature, who took a large share in the
proceedings of this public meeting. The resolutions proposed were
received with such ill-concealed dissatisfaction, that, after the
Mayor had declared two of them to be carried, the opponents of
the Government interfered, and such confusion prevailed that the
gentleman who presided vacated the chair, which was occupied by
Dr. Embling, and a series of resolutions diametrically opposed to
the proceedings of the Executive, and demanding an immediate
settlement of the differences between the Government and the
diggers, were carried with the utmost enthusiasm. Mr. Frencham,
who has been already alluded to as one of the discoverers of gold
in Victoria, spoke on behalf of the diggers, and told the people
they "must go forth with their brother diggers to conquer or
die." The Government demonstration having terminated in so very
unsatisfactory a manner, another meeting was convened on the
following day "for the assertion of order and the protection of
constitutional liberty." It took place on a large open space of
ground near St. Paul's Church, at the corner of Flinders lane.
From 4000 to 7000 people were present, the chair being filled by
Henry Langlands, Esq., one of the largest employers of labor in
Melbourne. The speakers were Messrs. Blair, Owens, Fawkner,
Fulton, Frencham, Grant, Cathie, and Embling. The resolutions
condemned the whole policy of the Government, and declared that,
while disapproving of the physical resistance offered by the
diggers, the meeting could not, without betraying the interests
of liberty, lend its aid to the Executive until the coercive
measures they were attempting to introduce should be abandoned.
The result of this meeting had very considerable weight with the
Executive, and the same afternoon a <i>Government Gazette</i>
extraordinary appeared, in which was a proclamation revoking
martial law on Ballarat.</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>The repulse at the Stockade did not depress the
diggers, and a body of about 1000 armed men was, at this time,
collected together on the Creswick road. It was very fortunate
that Sir Robert Nickle, who had now assumed the command, was an
old and experienced officer. He immediately restrained the
violence of the police and military, and held several parleys
with the disaffected diggers, in which he strongly urged them to
return to their duty.</blockquote>
<p>Some literal errors in M'Combie's narrative we have corrected
in [square] brackets. His phrase "30 men of Her Majesty's force"
should be 30 men of the mounted 40th. They were picked men of
that regiment. Raffaello, a little further on, calls them "Indian
dragoons". M'Combie is wrong also as to the diggers not being
depressed by the affair at the Stockade. The action of Sunday
entirely demolished the schemes of the insurgents. There was no
such gathering either on the Creswick road as that mentioned by
M'Combie. Archdeacon Stretch, of the English Church, bore witness
to the peaceable aspect of affairs at Creswick. The <i>Geelong
Advertiser</i>, of the 11th December, states that the Archdeacon
had been on "a conciliatory tour in the district, and reports the
25,000 diggers of Creswick Creek to be under the physical charge
of three policemen." The three constables were enough, and no
clearer evidence seems necessary to show how little disposed the
general population there was to armed resistance to the
authorities.</p>
<p>Here is Raffaello's description of the attack on the
Stockade:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><i>Remember this Sabbath Day (3rd December) to Keep
it Holy</i>.&mdash;I awoke. Sunday morning. It was full dawn, not
daylight. A discharge of musketry&mdash;then a round from the
bugle&mdash;the command "forward"&mdash;and another discharge of
musketry was sharply kept on by the red-coats (some 300 strong)
advancing on the gully west of the Stockade, for a couple of
minutes. The shots whizzed by my tent. I jumped out off the
stretcher and rushed to my chimney facing the Stockade. The
forces within could not muster above 150 diggers. The shepherd's
holes inside the lower part of the Stockade had been turned into
rifle-pits, and were now occupied by Californians of the I.C.
Rangers' Brigade, some twenty or thirty in all, who had kept
watch at the "outposts" during the night. Ross and his division
northward, Thonen and his division southward, and both in front
of the gully, under cover of the slabs, answered with such a
smart fire, that the military who were now fully within range,
did unmistakably appear to me to swerve from their ground; anyhow
the command "forward" from Sergeant Harris was put a stop to.
Here a lad was really courageous with his bugle. He took up
boldly his stand to the left of the gully and in front: the
red-coats "fell in" in their ranks to the right of this lad. The
wounded on the ground behind must have numbered a dozen. Another
scene was going on east of the Stockade. Vern floundered across
the Stockade eastward, and I lost sight of him. Curtain whilst
making coolly for the holes, appeared to me to give directions to
shoot at Vern; but a rush was instantly made in the same
direction (Vern's) and a whole pack cut for Warrenheip. There
was, however, a brave American officer, who had the command of
the rifle-pit men; he fought like a tiger; was shot in his thigh
at the very onset, and yet, though hopping all the while, stuck
to Captain Ross like a man. Should this notice be the means to
ascertain his name, it should be written down in the margin at
once. The dragoons from south, the troopers from north, were
trotting in full speed towards the Stockade. Peter Lalor was now
on the top of the first logged-up hole within the Stockade, and
by his decided gestures pointed to the men to retire among the
holes. He was shot down in his left shoulder at this identical
moment; it was a chance shot, I recollect it well. A full
discharge of musketry from the military now mowed down all who
had their heads above the barricades. Ross was shot in the groin.
Another shot struck Thonen exactly in the mouth, and felled him
on the spot. Those who suffered the most were the score of
pikemen, who stood their ground from the time the whole division
had been posted at the top, facing the Melbourne road from
Ballarat, in double file under the slabs, to stick the cavalry
with their pikes. The old command, "Charge!" was distinctly
heard, and the red-coats rushed with fixed bayonets to storm the
Stockade. A few cuts, kicks, and pulling down, and the job was
done too quickly for their wonted ardor, for they actually thrust
their bayonets on the body of the dead and wounded strewed about
on the ground. A wild "hurrah!" burst out, and the "Southern
Cross" was torn down, I should say, among their laughter, such as
if it had been a prize from a May-pole. Of the armed diggers,
some made off the best way they could, others surrendered
themselves prisoners and were collected in groups and marched
down the gully. The Indian dragoons, sword in hand, rifle-pistols
cocked, took charge of them all, and brought them in chains to
the lock-up. The red-coats were now ordered to "fall in"; their
bloody work was over, and were marched off, dragging with them
the "Southern Cross". Their dead, as far as I did see, were four,
and a dozen wounded, including Captain Wise, the identical one, I
think whom I speak of in relating the events of Tuesday evening,
November 28. Dead and wounded had been fetched up in carts,
waiting on the road, and all red-things hastened to Ballarat. I
hastened, and what a horrible sight! Old acquaintances crippled
with shots, the gore protruding from the bayonet wounds, their
clothes and flesh burning all the while. Poor Thonen had his
mouth literally choked with bullets; my neighbor and mate Teddy
More, stretched on the ground, both his thighs shot, asked me for
a drop of water. Peter Lalor, who had been concealed under a heap
of slabs, was in the agony of death, a stream of blood from under
the slabs heavily forcing its way down hill.</blockquote>
<p>Raffaello piles up too much agony here. He is right in
wounding his hero in the left arm, M'Combie being in error in
saying Lalor lost the right arm. A correspondent of the
<i>Geelong Advertiser</i>, not Irwin, gives the following tragic
picture of what he saw:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The first thing that I saw was a number of diggers
enclosed in a sort of hollow square, many of them were wounded,
the blood dripping from them as they walked; some were walking
lame, pricked on by the bayonets of the soldiers bringing up the
rear. The soldiers were much excited, and the troopers madly so,
flourishing their swords, and shouting out&mdash;"We have waked
up Joe!" and others replied, "And sent Joe to sleep again!" The
diggers' Standard was carried by in triumph to the Camp, waved
about in the air, then pitched from one to another, thrown down
and trampled on. The scene was awful&mdash;twos and threes
carried together, and all felt stupefied. I went with
R&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; to the barricade, the tents all
around were in a blaze; I was about to go inside, when a cry was
raised that the troopers were coming again. They did come with
carts to take away the bodies. I counted fifteen dead, one
G&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, a fine well-educated man, and a
great favorite. I recognised two others, but the spectacle was so
ghastly that I feel a loathing at the remembrance. They all lay
in a small space, with their faces upwards, looking like lead;
several of them were still heaving, and at every rise of their
breasts, the blood spouted out of their wounds, or just bubbled
out and trickled away. One man, a stout-chested fine fellow,
apparently about forty years old, lay with a pike beside him; he
had three contusions in the head, three strokes across the brow,
a bayonet wound in the throat under the ear, and other wounds in
the body&mdash;I counted fifteen wounds in that single carcase.
Some were bringing handkerchiefs, others bed furniture, and
matting to cover up the faces of the dead. O God! sir, it was a
sight for a Sabbath morn that, I humbly implore Heaven, may never
be seen again. Poor women crying for absent husbands, and
children frightened into quietness. I, sir, write
disinterestedly, and I hope my feelings arose from a true
principle; but when I looked at that scene, my soul revolted at
such means being so cruelly used by a Government to sustain the
law. A little terrier sat on the breast of the man I spoke of,
and kept up a continuous howl; it was removed, but always
returned to the same spot; and when his master's body was huddled
with the other corpses, into the cart, the little dog jumped in
after him, and lying again on his dead master's breast, began
howling again. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was dead there also,
and &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, who escaped, had said, that when he
offered his sword, he was shot in the side by a trooper, as he
was lying on the ground wounded. He expired almost immediately.
Another was lying dead just inside the barricade, where he seemed
to have crawled. Some of the bodies might have been
removed&mdash;I counted fifteen. A poor woman and her children
were standing outside a tent; she said that the troopers had
surrounded the tent, and pierced it with their swords. She, her
husband, and her children, were ordered out by the troopers, and
were inspected in their night-clothes outside, whilst the
troopers searched the tent. Mr. Hasleham was roused from sleep by
a volley of bullets fired through his tent; he rushed out, and
was shot down by a trooper, and handcuffed. He lay there bleeding
from a wound in his breast, until his friends sent for a
blacksmith, who forced off the handcuffs with a hammer and cold
chisel. When I last heard of Mr. Hasleham, a surgeon was
attending him, and probing for the ball.</blockquote>
<p>Shanahan, in whose store the dream of anti-British freedom was
sketched out by the red-hot insurgents of the fiery period
between the burning of Bentley's hotel and the military attack of
the 3rd December, tells the following story:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The diggers were granted no redress, and their
complaints gradually grew louder until a climax was reached in
October, when the murder was committed (Scobie's) near Bentley's
hotel. I was at Bentley's just before it was burnt, Bentley ran
out and got off, or the diggers would have lynched him. I know
who set fire to the hotel. The poor fellow is dead now, and I am
not going to mention his name. On the Saturday afternoon before
the attack on the Stockade a deputation, consisting of Captain
Ross, Black, Manning, Hayes, Curtain, and myself, and about five
others, went up to the Camp to see if any redress would be given
to the diggers. Those in charge at the Camp promised everything
to the deputation, who then left. On the way back to the Eureka
we met the Creswick contingent of diggers, several hundred
strong, and when they were told that a fair settlement had been
promised, they laughed at it, and aaid the promises were only
given to catch the diggers in a trap. Their words came true. On
Saturday night there was a large number of diggers in the
Stockade. I kept a store within the Stockade. Lalor was in
charge, but large numbers of the men were constantly going out of
the Stockade, and as the majority got drunk, they never came
back. Esmond, like a gentleman as he was, got powder and shot
from a shop down the Main Road, and paid for it out of his own
pocket. The 500 or 600 from Creswick had nothing to eat, and
they, too, went down the Main Road that night. The men constantly
going out&mdash;it was dry work in the Stockade&mdash;[now some
long thirsty months away from the days of ten gallon grog kegs at
£1 a gallon]&mdash;and Lalor seeing that none would be left if
things went on, he gave orders to shoot any man who left. Vern
cleared out immediately, and order was given to shoot him, but he
got away. It was about two or three o'clock on Sunday morning
when Vern went away. Those in the Stockade had anything but a
pleasant time of it, as the accommodation was not sufficient even
for the small number of men that remained. Anyway, after the
promises received in the afternoon from the Commissioners, it was
thought that there was no danger, and the diggers did not know
whether to go on with the armed resistance or stop. About three
o'clock in the morning there were about 150 pikemen inside the
Stockade, and some others. M'Cullagh and Glenn, two diggers, were
seen prowling about the Stockade, and they were taken prisoners
as spies. They roared for their liberty, and were let go, it
being too much trouble to keep them. My wife and one or two other
women were in the Stockade, and I was in bed, when I heard shots,
crack, crack, in quick succession. Got up and seized my gun, and
went to the door. The soldiers were about a hundred yards away,
and I could see some of our poor fellows lying dead, nine being
killed by the first volley. The diggers were up, and a lot of
them had evidently made up their minds to fight to the death.
When Captain Wise and his regiment saw that the diggers were
awake and meant resistance, he sang out, "Fortieth! are you going
to retreat?" I am sure he said that. Orders had been given to
pick off the leaders of the soldiers, and Captain Wise was
shortly afterwards shot. The shooting on both sides then went on,
and it was only the bags of flour that kept my wife and me from
being shot. A lot of the diggers commenced to run away, and after
the shooting was done I saw Ned Flynn run into an old chimney,
and a soldier ran up to him and stuck him in the neck with a
bayonet. Everyone they caught they slaughtered. It was not in the
Stockade that they killed the majority of the diggers, but in the
running away. I took refuge in an outhouse, and the troopers and
soldiers did not see me. They commenced setting fire to every
tent on the ground, using a pot of burning tar. Our tent was set
on fire, but my wife put it out before it was all
burnt.</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Shanahan was much interested at this part of her
husband's narrative, and took up the story herself,
saying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I heard the firing first. My husband was not long
gone to bed, and I pulled him out and told him the firing was on.
He got up, and, said I to him, take out your gun. There is the
little gun (pointing to an ancient fire arm against the wall). He
went out, and must have hid himself in a small outhouse. There
was a knock at our tent door, and a trooper and a soldier came
in. "Shoot that woman", said the trooper. The foot soldier said,
"Spare the woman", and the trooper said, "Well, get out of this,
the place is going to be burnt down." They set fire to the place,
but before it was much burnt I managed to put it out.<br>
<br>
"The soldiers did not stay long," continued Shanahan, "and
galloped away at once. I went out and had a look round. [The
cautiously valiant man of big words yonder at the non-military
camp in the far off Golden Point days!] There were dead bodies
here and there. I would never like to see such a sight again. The
poor fellows who had fought for their liberty I If all the people
saw what I saw, there would soon be a grand monument up to those
poor fellows. [The old man, say the interviewers, was here much
moved.] We found Peter Lalor down a hole with his arm broken. We
got him out, and he was taken away on Father Smyth's horse. I
counted twenty-two dead. The pikemen suffered most."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. R. Lorimer, who was boarding at Skarrett's Victoria
Restaurant, near the Stockade, in a paper he gives to us, tells
how Mrs. Skarrett, by drawing a revolver from her bosom and
threatening to shoot, saved her horse from being carried off on
the Saturday morning by three men who claimed to be sent by the
"commander in chief". He then narrates what he saw and heard on
the Sunday morning:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>On the morning of the 3rd of December, immediately
before daybreak, I was awoke by the sound of a bugle. My mate,
Tom Green, a rifleman, who had been in active service in India,
under Lord Gough, was sleeping on the table beside me. He said,
"Ah! that sound is only too well known to me; the military are
there, the bugle call means 'extend into skirmishing order.'"
Immediately afterwards a solitary shot was fired. Another bugle
call was given, and rapid firing was heard. We were all soon out
of bed, or rather off the tables&mdash;we all slept on the
tables. Tom Green, with rifle in hand, guarded the back door, and
I, with rifle in hand, mounted on the frame work of the canvas
structure, looked out of the opening over the door and guarded
the front. The women and children were all out of their beds, and
were lying flat on the floor. By this time the firing was rapid
and general, The bullets were whizzing about like mosquitoes, and
at times were rather near to be pleasant. Still, only two struck
the tent. When the fight was going on, I saw Mr. Gaynor and two
others hurrying down the Eureka lead with Peter Lalor. They
lifted him up and placed him inside of a the of slabs, which was
stacked immediately opposite to my "look-out opening. "Shortly
after Father Smythe, mounted on his grey horse, rode up to the
pile and spoke to Mr. Lalor. I conjectured that he was wounded.
The stores and tents in the Stockade were then burning. The bugle
had sounded the "general assembly", and the soldiers were
preparing to march back to the Camp, taking with them in the
ambulance carts their dead and wounded, when I saw thorn clear
away, I went out with my companions and made for the pile of
slabs. One of the boarders came with us in his drawers and night
shirt, and had a pair of slippers on his feet. A trooper came
galloping down towards us. We retired again to the tent, but our
half dressed friend stood. The trooper stopped in front of him,
raised his sword over his head, and called out, "Oh! you
b&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; b&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, you was one of
them. Come along with me, and if you look back I will cut you
down." In this state, half dressed as he was, he was driven
before the trooper to the logs in the Camp reserve. We then made
again for the pile of slabs. We climbed up and spoke to Lalor,
who said, "For God's sake, boys, go and leave me." I replied, "If
you wish to escape, now is your time; the soldiers are gone, and
the troopers have cleared away also." "Down with the pile of
slabs, boys." The work was done in a few seconds. Taking Lalor's
coloured handkerchief, we bound it tightly over the top wound,
making it a very good ligature, and giving him in charge of Billy
Smythe, or Smith, to take to some place of safety, we bid him
good-bye. Our half-naked friend was liberated in about a week
after. Mrs. Skarrat, and one or two others, proved that he was in
bed at the time of the riot; but the trooper persisted that he
was "one of them&mdash;he knew him too well." "New Zealand
Jamie", or James Powell, occupied the same cell with him. Powell
was very badly wounded, and his wounds got no attention from the
authorities. Hundreds of maggots were crawling in and out of the
festering sores, which were disgusting to behold; but the puppets
of the Camp had no pity. Death put an end to his misery and
suffering, and his body now rests in the Old Cemetery with the
other victims of the misgovernment of that day. All honour to the
brave fellows who fell, however misguided they may have been.
Gaynor, who placed Lalor in the pile of slabs, is now a
respectable farmer at Ross's Creek; but of the others who removed
him from the slab pile I know nothing, save and except
myself.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. James M'Dowall writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>This muster obstructed business of every description.
Plunder and daylight robberies were very prevalent for a time.
Stores robbed, and the contents carted into the Stockade,
surrounded by guns and old rusty bayonets, the storekeepers not
daring to say&mdash;what doest thou. A short time prior to this
date I had gone into business in the timber trade. Finding that
one of my valuable horses had been taken from one of my men when
on his way home with a load of timber, I marched straight to the
Stockade, and had an interview with the Commander in Chief,
Frederick Vern. I endeavoured to regain possession of my horse,
but without success. The Commander informed me that his men
should require horses; but pressing my claim still further, I
secured a written guarantee that should any damage be done to the
horse, it should be made good. This document described the horse
correctly, and was signed&mdash;A.A. Black, Secretary of War. By
order of the Commander in Chief, Frederick Vern, On the following
day, after the battle was over, the horse was found with a very
severe wound on his stern, thereby proving that he and his rider
(if any) were clearing out while the battle was raging. Soon
after that date the government sent up a Commission of Enquiry,
and advertisements appeared, inviting anyone who had suffered any
loss to present their claims. I, amongst others, attended, gave
evidence, and presented my written guarantee, which was looked on
as a great curiosity. The Commission impounded the document, but
never paid one penny, whilst some others were paid handsomely for
their losses, or supposed losses. On my return from the Stockade
I paid a visit to the Commissioners' Camp, and demanded
protection from the authorities, but was told that the proper
time had not arrived. When looking over this Camp, according to
the description given by me before the Commission, a ring being
formed round the Camp and guarded by the police, the authorities
were concealed behind a fortification made of bales of hay and
other horse feed in bags, and I was only allowed to speak to the
said authorities through a small space near to the roof of a
verandah of the house wherein they were fortified. The following
day presented a sad spectacle on the same spot, where the wounded
and dying were congregated, and were under the hands of the
medical men.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Arthur Croft, an old digger, who arrived in Ballarat early
in November, 1852, as one of a party of seven, writes as
follows:&mdash;"We paid £84 to bring us up, a dray with only one
horse in the shafts." An incredibly high price to pay for the
luxury of "holding on to a rope going down hill to keep the dray
from going too fast," and then having to submit to being bogged
and capsized, with accompanying smashes of "nearly all our
cooking materials", etc. The old digger's next experience was
with his mates sinking a shallow hole at Little Bendigo, where
they got no gold, for the diggers in the adjoining hole advised
them to drive away from the gold, whilst the advisers "were
taking out the gold all the time&mdash;artful old dogs." Other
failures caused the party to break up, and our friend says his
brother took the Balligney hotel in the Black Hill flat, "where a
Freemasons' lodge was held." The lodge was at the Ballagney
hotel. Meanwhile Croft was in a claim on the Gravel Pits, and
while at the windlass one day "a lady stranger came up to me and
asked how it was looking; so I told her. We talked together for
some time, and she explained the mode of digging in California.
Well, the men's time below was up, and she gave me a hand at the
windlass, and when the men came up she went away, but left a
pound to spend amongst us. She was the renowned Lola Montes, the
splendid dancer and man-killer&mdash;I mean for her beauty. So we
named the claim the Lola Montes, and wrote it in charcoal on the
canvas of the tent. The very day after that she horsewhipped
Seekamp, the editor of the paper at that time." After this
adventure, our hero turns up "in the Township", where he sold his
share for £10, and "the very next day they shared about £10 a
man, and upwards for several months afterwards&mdash;in all about
£200 a man," The narrative is incoherent as to dates and other
things, but the consummation in the shape of "£200 a man" is
intelligible. After that, this not very lucky digger opened the
"Blue and White Flag" store, close to where the diggers
subsequently built their Stockade. On the fatal Sunday morning he
ventured into the Stockade, when the little battle was all over,
having first hoisted the blue and white flag half-mast high. "The
poor fellows lay covered with bullet wounds. There was a little
dog close to one of them, and he would not allow anyone to touch
him." Whether the "him" refers to the dog "or one of them," we do
not know, so we will say, in the words of the old digger, "no
more on that miserable affair&mdash;it was all brought about
regarding the 30s. license." The narrator, after passing through
a very hazy thereafter, emerges in a few years upon the Corner.
"Another spec.", he sententiously proceeds. "Tried sharebroking.
Went as clerk to one of them. Regarding the rise of shares, the
greatest took place in a claim called Waterloo. They were worth
£70 in the morning, and went up to £500 or more before the day
was out. I was making sale notes out all the time for Mr. Croyle,
the broker." Fortune never smiled benignly upon this Protean
adventurer, and his modesty sums up all the subsequent course, so
far, of his pilgrimage here in the words&mdash;"I am still living
in Ballarat." He is one of the "Old Identities", or "Old
Colonists", mentioned elsewhere, and we may well take our leave
of him in wishing him a happy issue out of all his
troubles.<br></p>

<br>
<p>The fortunes of the Ballarat branch of the Bank of Victoria
during the troubles between the diggers and the authorities, that
is just as the troubles were about to culminate at the Stockade,
throw some light on the state of things at that time. In the
October of 1854, just before the collision at the Stockade, the
bank was an "iron pot", that is, a frame of wood lined and
covered with galvanised iron. It was on the south side of Sturt
street, just east of the Survey office of that time, and about
150 feet west of the corner of Doveton street. One Saturday,
about noon, three or four armed bushrangers walked into the bank,
tied and gagged John Buckley, the manager, and the accountant,
one Marshall, took notes and cash to the amount of £18,000, and
vanished. In the following November a new manager was sent up,
Mr. William Robertson, who has been here ever since. He has
lately surrendered his charge, but till then (close of 1886) was
the oldest banker in Ballarat. The iron pot was abandoned after
the robbery, and a stone building, set up where the present bank
is in Lydiard street, was purchased by the bank proprietary. It
was a poor affair, though the first stone house erected in
Ballarat, and may, in part, now be seen doing service as a shabby
little one-story cottage in Holmes street, two doors from
Grenville College. Still it was, for 1854, a great architectural
achievement, and at one time attracted military notice. This was
the week preceding the attack upon the insurgent diggers at the
Stockade. At that time patrols of troopers and mounted infantry
of the 40th Regiment were told off to draw a cordon round the
Camp, and so great was the apprehension that masses of diggers
would come into Ballarat from Creswick, Mount Alexander, and
other places, that the military patrols prohibited any persons
not resident within the streets adjacent to the Camp from passing
along those thoroughfares. Fear had fallen upon all sides, and
one day a banker seriously suggested to Mr. Robertson the
propriety of their concealing their treasures somewhere in the
bush. He rejected this advice, and though the banks took their
treasure chests to the Camp every evening, he also rejected
advice from the Camp authorities to abandon the bank and come
into Camp till the trouble was over. Now, as the bank was of
stone, and the Camp of canvas or wood, Mr. Robertson waited upon
Captain Thomas, the officer in command, and represented to him
the possibility of the diggers seizing an empty stone building
thus facing the Camp, and making it a <i>point d'appui</i>
<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#fn12" class=
"fnanchor">[12]</a> for attack. The captain saw the danger, and
instead of getting the banker to desert his bank, sent men to
fortify it. This was a few days before the Stockade affair, and
until the fatal Sunday was over, all business at the bank was
suspended. The doors and windows were boarded over thickly, and
bags of chaff, bran, hay, sand, or what not, were heaped up
behind the boards to make the place bullet proof. Thirty-six
civilians from the Camp, armed with muskets, were sent over to
the bank every night. They were divided into three squads,
officered by Commissioners Webster, Johnstone, and another, and
anxious watch was kept up at a sky light at the rear, and
commanding the then near bush, so that the approach of the
expected insurgent reinforcements that way might be detected in
time. At dawn of Sunday, the 3rd December, a trooper came from
the Camp to the bank garrison to put them on their guard, as
something was going to happen. Soon after that the discharge of
fire arms in the distance was heard, and in a short time another
trooper came to the bank to say all the trouble was over, and the
garrison could sally forth in safety or stand at ease within the
fort. Mr. Robertson says he and others went out, and he saw the
military and troopers returning into Camp with from a hundred to
a hundred and fifty prisoners, and dying Captain Wise borne by
soldiers on a litter into Camp.</p>
<p>With regard to the attack on the Stockade, the author has a
letter signed "John Neill, late of the 40th Regiment," and dated
from Devil's Gully on the 7th of February, 1870. Neill thus
describes the approach of the troops and what followed, his
grammar only being amended and redundant matter
omitted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>As a military man, and one who took a most prominent
part in all the military movements of that day, I beg leave to
offer a remark upon the statement made by the Government officer
of the Camp. The small force consisted of detachments of the 12th
and 40th Regiments, and a few troopers and foot police, the whole
under the command of Captains Thomas and Wise, and a Lieutenant
of the 12th&mdash;I forget his name. The order to fall-in and be
silent was given, and when Captain Thomas had spoken a few words
we were put in motion, led by Captain Wise. The party had not
advanced three hundred yards before we were seen by the rebel
sentry, who fired, not at our party, but to warn his party in the
Stockade. He was on Black Hill. Captain Thomas turned his head in
the direction of the shot, and said&mdash;"We are seen. Forward,
and steady men! Don't fire; let the insurgents fire first. You
wait for the sound of the bugle." [More credible this than Teddy
Shanahan's version.] When within a short distance of the
Stockade, the insurgents fired. Captain Wise fell, wounded
mortally. The same volley wounded the lieutenant of the l2th,
already spoken of, and three of his men; two killed, one wounded
of the 40th&mdash;Privates Michael Roony, Joseph Wall, killed;
William Juniper, badly wounded. The Camp officer says the police
were the first to enter the Stockade. He is wrong. There was not
one policeman killed or wounded during the whole affair. When
Captain Wise fell the men cheered, and were over in the Stockade
in a second, and then bayonet and pike went to work. The diggers
fought well and fierce, not a word spoken on either side until
all was over. The blacksmith who made the pikes was killed by
Lieut. Richards, 40th Regiment. Honor to his name: he fought well
and died gloriously. It was rumored that at that time the police
were cruel to the Mounded and prisoners. No such thing. The
police did nothing but their duty, and they did it well for men
that were not accustomed to scenes of blood or violence. To my
knowledge there was only one wounded man despatched, and he kept
swinging his pike about his head as he sat on the ground. His two
legs were broken, and he had a musket ball in his body. He could
not live, and it was best to despatch him. His name was O'Neill,
a native of Kilkenny, Ireland. I heard this statement from a
sergeant of police, and I know it was correct.</blockquote>
<p>It is but just that it should be stated that, in reply to
Raffaello's statement that Kennedy took up the cause of the
diggers out of mere regard for Scobie, Kennedy avers, in a letter
in the <i>Ballarat Star</i> of the 22nd December, 1856, addressed
to Raffaello:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>If suffering and loss be a proof that I have
something more than talking heroism, or a prejudicial love for my
country or countrymen, lam the man that can give that proof. Last
year the same Thomas Kennedy sacrificed £1800 for the cause of
the diggers alone; but that is not all. I have sometimes wrought
ten hours a day for three days running on bread and water on
account of these rows.</blockquote>
<p>Kennedy generally defends himself in his letters against
Raffaello's criticisms, and says, as to the license-burning
meeting, that he refused to join that movement unless 4000 came
forward to join the League. He then says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>But, Raffaello, I well remember on that day that when
you came forward and addressed the public (to use your own
phraseology towards other people in page 59), "such suicidal
rant" was used by you that day that I was compelled to take you
by the arm and conduct you from the front of the platform to
nearly the middle of it, and I believe from that moment your
Italian blood was aroused, and in some measure interprets some
part of your work.</blockquote>
<p>Most people who knew Raffaello will be ready to say that
Kennedy's story is not very improbable.</p>
<p>Raffaello speaks in fierce language of his treatment in the
"lousy logs". He was taken with the other State prisoners to
Melbourne:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>On passing through the Eureka I got a glance of my
snug little tent, where I had passed so many happy hours, and was
sacred to me on a Sunday. There it lay deserted, uncared for. My
eyes were choked with tears, and at forty years of age a man does
not cry for little.</blockquote>

<br>
<p>How many others owed their death to the Stockade attack can
hardly be stated. Some lingered long, and died of wounds received
there. The <i>Melbourne Herald</i> of the 12th May, 1856,
reported:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Amongst the deaths of recent occurrence at the
Benevolent Asylum is that of Frederick Coxhead, native of London,
lawyer's clerk, and 24 years of age. He sided with the insurgents
at the memorable battle of the Eureka Stockade at Ballarat, and
received a gun-shot wound. Compression of the brain ensued, and
an abscess then set in, which terminated fatally on
Sunday.</blockquote>
<p>The authorities were under the impression that Vern was the
insurgent leader, and as Vern, and Lalor, and Black, the
"minister of war", escaped the grip of the assaulting force,
rewards were offered for their apprehension. For Vern, as the
presumed chief, £500 were offered, and for Lalor and Black £200
each None of them were ever arrested. Black was not present at
the affair of the 3rd. Lalor had been severely wounded, and was
supposed at first to be dead. He was covered up by a pikeman with
slabs, till the soldiers retreated with their prisoners, when he
left his hiding place, weary and faint with pain and loss of
blood. Having made good his escape, he was, after divers
troubles, secreted at a friendly hut on the ranges, where friends
ministered to his necessities. On the night of the 4th he was
conveyed to Father Smyth's house, where his arm was amputated by
Dr. Doyle. Women may live nearer to the invisible than men, and
be more rich in gifts of spiritual vision. Dreams and
presentiments are sometimes theirs when the stronger sex see and
hear nothing. It was said that Lalors betrothed in
(Geelong&mdash;whom he afterwards married&mdash;saw him "in a
vision of the night" or early morning of the 3rd December,
wounded and bleeding before her. It was further said that her
vision was a tolerably accurate picture of his actual condition.
In an age of vote by ballot and much hard iron machinery Puck's
declaration has been realised in the electric telegraph, and,
still, "there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt
of in our philosophy." To leave the speculative for the known, it
will suffice here to record that search for the fugitive chiefs
was made, and Lalor, who had many narrow escapes, was hidden in
various places by his friends till the storm had blown over, when
he was removed to Geelong, and underwent further surgical
operations, the authorities appearing to have given over the
pursuit. Ross had died from wounds received on the Sunday
morning, and Vern escaped, and hid in various places till danger
passed away with the subsequent acquittal of the State prisoners.
M 'Gill's story is that he and some others, not thinking all was
over when they fled, repaired to Creswick with a view to get out
of harm's immediate way, and to secure two field-pieces that were
said to be on Captain Hepburn's property at Smeaton. That project
was soon abandoned, and M'Gill had to disguise himself and fly.
He was met at the Springs by Mrs. Hanmer and another, who
furnished him with woman's attire, in which he travelled by coach
to Melbourne on the 5th, passing Sir Robert Nickle and his troops
on their way up near the Moorabool. By advice of the since
notorious G.F. Train, then Melbourne agent for the White Star
Company's line of ships, M'Gill, disguised afresh in man's
attire, went on board the "Arabian" as an officer of the ship. In
the meantime Train and other American citizens interposed on
behalf of their compatriot, whose youth&mdash;he was then about
twenty-one years old&mdash;they pleaded in bar of grave
punishment. Train sent to M'Gill one day, got him ashore, took
him to Sir Charles Hotham's at Toorak, and after a brief
interview the Governor, who expressed surprise at M'Gill's youth,
bowed them out hopefully. Train next informed his client that the
Government would not interfere to prevent his escape if he left
the colony forthwith. M'Gill, however, still by the ever-vigilant
Train's agency, was passed on as an invalid to the health
officer's quarters at Port Phillip Heads, where he remained until
the acquittal of the State prisoners practically proclaimed
liberty to all the compromised. It was rumored at one time that
M'Gill shot Captain Wise, then that he was pardoned because he
saved Captain Wise's life in the Stockade, then that he was let
off because he was an American. What happened to him because of
his nationality cannot be precisely known. He avers that he
neither shot Captain Wise nor saved him from any threatened harm.
As to his Americanism, it is certain that a strong feeling
existed at the time against what was considered a fear of
American influence on the part of the Government. It is equally
certain that the Government attributed the outbreak in a great
measure to the treasonable schemes of concerting foreigners then
in Ballarat and active in the agitations of the time.</p>
<p>That intelligent witness of most of the incidents during the
whole agitation, upon whose papers in the <i>Ballarat Star</i> we
have so freely drawn, makes the following statement relative to
the later scenes in the drama:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>After the capture of the Stockade, it may well be
imagined that there was a good deal of flight and hiding indulged
in, and some singular incidents could be narrated in reference
thereto. Lalor, Esmond, and others, some of them immediately, and
others from time to time, found their way to Geelong, where they
were secreted by various friends. The local police knew where
most of the Geelong fugitives were, but as most of them had
influential friends they were not molested, the more so as the
Government said they had quite enough of the insurgents in their
clutches. Messrs. Black and Kennedy started in company to make
for Geelong. The latter, in his usual self-opinionated way,
assured his companion that he knew all about the road to Geelong
by way of the Mount Misery Ranges. How the fugitives took a pair
of scissors and "barberised" each other, exchanging clothes, and
generally disguising themselves, need not be minutely detailed.
At last, towards evening, Kennedy acknowledged he was lost,
though after a time a smoke was seen, and was soon found to be
from an encampment, a sort of out-station depot or rural retreat
for some of the rowdy boys of Ballarat. Kennedy was for being
very mysterious, but Black frankly told the men that he and his
companion were in some trouble&mdash;what he did not
say&mdash;with the Government. He also let them see that he had
plenty of money, and gave them £5 to get some stores. The
messengers who went for the stores returned on the Monday
evening, bringing a bottle of wine. How a decent fellow of the
party took Black's side when some of his mates would have
ill-treated him&mdash;how Black and Kennedy separated, the latter
going bullock-driving&mdash;and how Black, meeting with other
fugitives, at last got up to Melbourne, where his friends
secreted him&mdash;would fill columns; but these things are more
of a private or personal than a public interest. Mr. Seekamp was
arrested on the Monday after the capture of the Stockade, he
having £105 on him, and about to go to Bendigo. An extraordinary
issue of the <i>Ballarat Times</i> was in course of publication
when Mr. Seekamp was arrested. Hearing of his arrest, a friend
called at the <i>Times</i> office and found a quiet enough
account of the capture of the Stockade, wound up by about a
"stickful" commencing thus, "This foul and bloody murder calls to
high Heaven for vengeance, terrible and immediate," &amp;c.,
&amp;c. The copies that had been already printed were taken away
and burned, all save one, which probably by this time has shared
the same fate. After the acquittal of some of the State prisoners
and the release of the remainder of them, those who had not been
apprehended, and for whom large rewards had been offered, were in
a somewhat anomalous position. Virtually they were as free from
blame and as little hindered as others from going about, but
actually they had the reward hanging over them, and some of them,
at least, might tempt a needy man to assassinate them, as the
reward was for them "dead or alive". Well, a land sale was
advertised to be held in the old Police-court on the Camp. Some
of the allotments were at Glendaruel, and Lalor had decided to
purchase some of them. Of course, he could do so by an agent, but
he preferred a bolder course, for, to the astonishment of his
friends, all of whom by this time knew where he was, he appeared
publicly on the day of the land sale, went to the Police-court to
bid for the allotments, and when asked who's the purchaser, gave
his name in the usual way. There was no more secrecy after this;
the matter was reported to head-quarters, and the rewards were
withdrawn in an early number of the <i>Government
Gazette</i>.</blockquote>

<br>
<p>Very barbarous excesses were charged against some of the
troopers and other members of the civil arm, and one Powell was
declared to have been murdered in cold blood, by Arthur Purcell
Akehurst, a Government officer, but the officer was acquitted by
the jury at the trial. Raffaello and the journals of the day give
particulars of this very ugly episode. Akehurst is now a
magistrate, and chairman of the Central Board of Health. Wanton
wounding of mere spectators or unresisting insurgents was alleged
to have been perpetrated, and it was gravely suspected that some
wounded men were burned alive when the troopers fired the tents.
One of the wounded spectators was Frank Arthur Hasleham, then
acting for the correspondent of the <i>Geelong Advertiser</i>.
Hasleham, in a memorial for compensation, describes himself as "a
native of the good town of Bedford, and son of a military
officer, to wit, William Gale Hasleham, who bore His Majesty's
commission in the 48th Foot at Talavera." He was compensated by
the Government subsequently, and after some years' sojourn here
he went home to England. Some twenty-three who fell were buried
by their friends, and the anniversary of the day was kept up with
gradually decreasing demonstration. It may be stated here that
the news of the attack on the Stockade reached Melbourne on the
same day, and while Governor Hotham and Secretary Foster were
attending divine service at St. James' Church, in Melbourne.
Attorney-General Stawell and others were seen earnestly talking
near the church, waiting for the Governor, and when his
Excellency came out Foster went his way home, the
Attorney-General and other of the Ministers accompanied the
Governor to the Government printer, Mr. John Ferres, and urged
him at once to issue a placard. This placard was printed and
posted about the city on the Sunday, although dated as on the
previous day. This placard was the one in which the Governor
calls on "all British subjects to abstain, not only from
identifying themselves" with "evil disposed persons", but "to
render support and assistance to the authorities." The placard by
the French consul was printed also on the Sunday. At the
Governor's special and personal request also, on the 6th of
December, a placard was issued with the words in large letters
"Sevastopol is taken." This was declared to be a stratagem to
divert public attention from the meeting to be held on that day
in Melbourne for expression of sympathy with the Ballarat
diggers. Many of those who were officially close to Sir Charles
Hotham in those days were warm in his praise. They spoke of him
as "a splendid fellow", and asserted boldly that he was misled by
bad advisers.</p>
<p>On Monday, the 4th December, 1854, the Government issued a
proclamation placing the "district of Buninyong"&mdash;for the
old name with slightly changed spelling still prevailed over that
of Ballarat&mdash;under martial law. On the same day, in the
afternoon, an extraordinary <i>Gazette</i> was issued, calling on
"all true subjects of the Queen, and all strangers who have
received hospitality and protection under her flag to enrol
themselves, and be prepared to assemble at such places as may be
appointed by the civic authorities in Melbourne and Geelong, and
by the magistrates in the several towns of the colony."
Simultaneously a reward of £500 for Vern's apprehension, was
offered, as the authorities not only thought he was the commander
of the insurgents, but were haunted by another delusion, born of
rumor, that Vern and some associates were erecting another
stockade; in the Warrenheip forest. The metropolis was frightened
from its propriety by the aspect of affairs at Ballarat. The
<i>Herald</i> reported on the 4th that "One time it was said that
an invading army of diggers was marching upon Melbourne,
intending a general sack and pillage; next, that portions of the
road were beset with guerilla parties anxious to have a shy at
any detached troops and police who might happen to pass.
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;
Throughout the day there was almost a constant swearing-in of
special constables at the police-office." Deputations waited upon
the Governor, declaring their loyalty. Meetings were convened in
the metropolis, some to sympathise with the diggers, others to
rally round the law and the authorities. Thus were the distant
places shaken by the collision of that early Sunday morning at
Ballarat. The poor diggers, in truth, wanted neither "sack nor
pillage", but only to be treated as freemen, and to be governed
by laws made by parliaments in which they had free
representation, and not by laws enacted by a nominee legislature,
and insolently, and sometimes corruptly, administered by men
irresponsible to the people. Yet, as has been said before, there
were rash and foolish and disloyal men among the insurgents. To
them, and them alone, may be fairly applied the words of Sir C.
Hotham in reply to one of the deputations to whom he spoke of
"designing men who had ulterior views, and who hoped to profit by
anarchy and confusion." But such men are found in all uprisings,
and their presence in this one neither justified the wrongs of
the times nor deprived the resistance of freemen of its inherent
virtue. The Melbourne alarm, however, was not without fruit. The
sympathy meetings were attended by large masses, and men of all
classes united in condemning the misrule which had caused the
outbreak. It chanced that just about this time the members of the
Melbourne bar were roused by an attack by the <i>Geelong
Advertiser</i> upon one of their brotherhood, who was accused of
conduct unbecoming a prudent lawyer and a true gentleman. Then
the barristers rushed to arms and fought on platforms in their
brother's behalf, and while their weapons were yet keen-edged and
bright the lawyers gathered also to the larger battle then waging
between the gold-fields population and the Government. At a mass
meeting held on the 13th January, 1855, in Swanston
street&mdash;where the Anglican Cathedral is now slowly rising in
its fair proportions&mdash;the State prisoners being yet untried,
a petition for a general amnesty was adopted. In that petition
the true cause of the rising, in so far as its moral force phases
had gone, was set forth as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The recent unhappy outbreak at Ballarat was induced
by no feeling of disaffection to the person of her Majesty, and
by no traitorous designs against the institutions of the
monarchy, but purely by a sense of political wrong, a loss of
confidence in the local administration of law, and an irritation
engendered by the injudicious and offensive enforcement of an
obnoxious and invidious tax, which, though legal, has since been
condemned by the Goldfields Commission.</blockquote>
<p>Thousands of people in Ballarat subscribed a similar petition,
but the Government refused the amnesty. The whole colony felt the
rising to be serious. The Executive was certainly alarmed, and on
the 7th December Mr. Foster, the Chief Secretary, gave way before
the popular storm and resigned office. Foster was a member of the
Vesey family in the Irish peerage. To him, as the prime spirit in
the Legislative Council and Cabinet, great odium attached, for he
was regarded as the mainstay of the system of misrule and
nomineeism, and his resignation was, therefore, judicious if not
necessary. It is probable that Sir Charles Hotham, however, was
more directly responsible for the policy of the time than, to
judge from the general feeling against Foster, was supposed by
the population generally. Mr. Samuel Irwin furnishes some
evidence, or hints of evidence, in support of this probability.
He says, in his contributions to the <i>Ballarat Star</i> on the
Eureka Stockade affair:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Those who take an interest in these matters and have
the requisite leisure might, among other documents, refer to the
evidence given before a select committee of Parliament in the
case of Mr. Foster when he sought to gain his pension. From the
evidence in this case they will find that a very unwilling
witness says Sir Charles Hotham had made up his mind before he
left England what course he would pursue, and that he had even in
sight of the English coast, said that the unruly gold-finders
wanted "blood letting". The expression may not be literally
correct, but at all events it signified that he would adopt
repressive measures on Ills arrival. The same
evidence&mdash;dragged from an unwilling witness&mdash;also went
to show that Sir Charles Hotham used to correspond with the
Resident Commissioner on the gold-fields in cypher and without
the advice or even the knowledge of Mr. Foster. This much in
justice to the reputation of one of the best abused men of the
time referred to, who, whatever other sins he was guilty of, was
not so of one-half of those then laid to his charge. The burning
of Bentley's hotel, as may be imagined, created no small
consternation in the official mind. With the now well ascertained
opinions of Sir Charles Hotham on subordination, it may be
readily imagined that he was furious at this open revolt against
the law and fully bent on avenging the outrage.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Haines succeeded Foster, and the Legislative Council a day
or two afterwards passed an Act of Indemnity for the declaration
of martial law. The Act of Indemnity was passed on the 15th
December, and on the 11th and 18th the Government offered rewards
for the apprehension of Vern, Lalor, and Black,</p>
<p>Judge Wrixon and some barristers were at Bath's hotel on the
4th December, in readiness to open the General Sessions, but
though the gaol was full of prisoners the sessions could not be
held, because the Court-house had been turned into a guardroom,
and jurymen could hardly be got together in that time of
disturbance. The <i>Melbourne Herald</i> had sent up a special
correspondent, and on the 4th December he described his view of
the position of affairs. He discovers a solemn sense of the
importance of his office, asserts anxiety to preserve a just
neutrality, but feels bound to declare "it would appear that the
Government officials here are determined to lose no opportunity
of prolonging that animosity which it should be their duty to
obliterate for ever." That it was their duty is certain, and it
would have been well had they quickened duty with honest
endeavor. The <i>Herald's</i> ordinary, or "own", correspondent
also, on the 8th December, while the martial law recently
proclaimed was still in force, takes occasion to denounce the
civil officers of the Government Camp by contrasting their rule
with that of the military <i>régime</i>. He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The martial law administered by Sir R. Nickle is
about as far superior to the Commissioners' law, under which we
have been so long laboring, as it is possible for anything human
to be. Had Sir R. Nickle arrived here a few days before, the
bloodshed of last Sunday would have been avoided.</blockquote>
<p>There is ample reason for adopting this writer's view of the
situation. If the military rule was strong and odious because of
its nature, and the reflection of wrong which it threw upon the
diggers, it was also free from the still more odious and
exasperating insults of the rule of civilians enforcing an
irksome law with cruel impertinence and harassing personal
injuries. The proclamation of martial law was objected to at the
time as unconstitutional, and some protests were made. Whether
the proclamation was right or wrong, it is a notable fact that it
did not cover the attack of the military upon the diggers in the
Stockade That tragedy was enacted without the reading of the Riot
Act or the sanction of the existence of martial law, the
proclamation being made on the day after the Stockade action.
Another anomaly was the holding a coroner's inquest on one body
only. The time was, it seems, out of joint in many
particulars.</p>
<p>On the 6th December a large meeting of diggers was held on
Bakery Hill, Mr. Thomas Williams in the chair. Humffray was there
and Dr. Wills, father of the brave explorer who perished with
Burke. Coleman and Mosterd were there, who afterwards were
elected members of the Local Court. Resolutions were adopted
whose tone showed the influence of the fiery blast of Sunday
morning, and the rigor of martial law. They were mildly drawn,
but with a double meaning, apparently, being applicable to either
the authorities or the insurgents according to the mind of the
interpreter. Here are the resolutions:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Moved by Mr. Donald, seconded by Mr. W.
Levy&mdash;"That this meeting views with regret the proceedings
of the last week, rendering it necessary to assert the
sovereignty of law and order by the sacrifice of so many lives
and the proclamation of martial law."<br>
<br>
Moved by Mr. Mosterd, seconded by Dr. Wills&mdash;"That this
meeting considers the late appeal to arms to have been uncalled
for, and pledges itself to use every constitutional means to
restore tranquility and good feeling on the Ballarat
gold-fields."<br>
<br>
Moved by Mr..J.F. Coleman, seconded by Mr. Ingram&mdash;"That
this meeting hopes that the officer in command of her Majesty's
forces at Ballarat will act with as much forbearance and humanity
as the circumstances may admit of: otherwise the lives of many
innocent persons may be sacrificed."<br>
<br>
Moved by Mr. Harris, seconded by Mr. Douglass&mdash;"That when
the present excitement shall have ceased, we will pledge
ourselves in a constitutional manner to have our acknowledged
grievances brought before the Legislative Council of the
colony."<br>
<br>
Moved by Mr. J.B. Humffray, seconded by Mr. W.B.
Robinson&mdash;"That a copy of the resolutions passed at this
meeting, signed by the chairman, be forwarded to his Excellency
Sir Charles Hotham immediately. That a deputation be appointed to
wait on his representative at Ballarat, and present him with a
copy of the same."<br>
<br>
Moved by Mr. Dyte, seconded by Mr. Willern&mdash;"That the
following gentlemen be the deputation to the Camp: Mr. Thos.
Williams, chairman; Rev. P. Smyth; Messrs. Homffrays (Humffray),
Donald, Mosterd."</blockquote>

<p>The deputies were not very flatteringly received, for the
<i>Herald</i> correspondent says Humffray was arrested, and the
others were told by Mr. Commissioner Rede and Captain Pasley
"that they could not receive such resolutions as they were not
sufficiently eulogistic of the Government." This is probably
rather a comment by the correspondent than a statement in terms
of a naked fact. It is not probable that the Camp officials were
so far demented as to make so very silly a speech; but the
resolutions appear at any rate to have been rejected. As to
Humffray, though he thus fell among the Camp Phillistines,
peace-advocate though he was, he had been received at the meeting
"with loud and protracted cheering." He conjured the diggers to
refrain from further violence, and declared that he had put his
life in jeopardy during his moral-force campaign against the
insurgents and the authorities. He was liberated on the following
day. It is worth noting that on the same day as this Bakery Hill
meeting was held, a "monster meeting" was held on St. Paul's
Church Reserve, Melbourne, Mr. Langlands in the chair, when the
following motion, moved by Mr. David Blair, was seconded by Mr.
Fawkner and adopted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"That the constitutional agitation at Ballarat has
assumed its present unconstitutional form in consequence of the
coercion of military force, and that matters would not have been
precipitated to their present issue but for the harsh and
imprudent re-commencement of digger-hunting during the period of
excitement."</blockquote>
<p>It is impossible to avoid concurrence in the latter portion of
the resolution. The later digger-hunts were ordered by Sir
Charles Hotham, and were his cardinal blunder. His excellent
intentions, and his lucid and unanswerable expositions of the
duties of a Government in relation to the maintenance of law and
order, are all as idle judgments of sagacity after the event. He
was not a great politician nor politic, and his military
instincts knew nothing of concession or compromise with a people
clamoring against both law and administration. This must be
remembered, as well as the equally obvious fact that his
Excellency had difficulties of many kinds to overcome, when we
come presently to one of the Governor's special deliverances upon
the Eureka collision.</p>
<p>Reverting to the meeting in Melbourne, it may be stated that
one resolution by Mr. J.M. Grant, once Minister of Lands,
proposed that Messrs. Fawkner, Strachan, O'Shanassy, Cooke,
Fulton, Dr. Owens, and Westgarth, be a body of delegates to act
as a commission of arbitration and adjustment between the
authorities and the diggers. The meeting objected for awhile to
Mr. Fawkner. Possibly this was because on the previous day, in
the Legislative Council, that vigorous old "conscript father" had
carried the following resolution, so entirely true in its
eulogies and censures, if a little loose in
construction:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>That the thanks of this House are due to the officers
and men of her Majesty's 12th and 40th Regiments, sent last week
on duty to Ballarat, for their truly soldierlike and highly
commendable forbearance in receiving the hootings and violent
assaults of a mob of worthless idlers, whom no man can class as
true diggers: the merits of the forbearance and the steady
patience of men bearing arms in their hands wherewith to repel
assaults, stamps those troops and their commanders as truly
British troops.</blockquote>
<p>After some discussion the meeting consented to Mr. Fawkner
being one of the delegates, but added to the list the name of Mr.
Cathie, who afterwards became member for Ballarat East in the
Legislative Assembly. The Government declined to entertain the
proposition, but the Commission of Enquiry appointed by the
Government to report on gold-fields' grievances comprised several
of the gentlemen nominated at the meeting.</p>
<p>On the 6th December the following resolution was carried in
the Legislative Council, on the motion of Mr. Miller, seconded by
the Colonial Secretary (Foster), who had resigned, but still held
office:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"That the Lieut.-Governor, having been placed in a
painfully embarrassing position since his arrival in Victoria, is
entitled to the sympathy and support of this Council, and it
pledges itself by every means in its power to aid him in
restoring and maintaining law and order."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Miller, in moving the resolution, regretted the injuries
suffered by innocent men in the trouble, but said it was "patent
that all this disaster had been brought about mainly by the
off-scourings of the foreigners collected on the gold-fields from
every nation." The Colonial Secretary agreed with this, but Mr.
Myles, a member for Grant, opposed the motion, and, says the
reporter of the <i>Herald</i>, "attacked the policy of the
Government in a speech in which he had not the sympathy of a
single member of the House." Mr. Haines said "the time selected
for the outbreak was exceedingly bad&mdash;a time when the
Government proposed to look into all grievances." Unhappily for
the reputation of the Government, there will always stand out in
bold relief the steady pursuit of a policy of irritation and
non-compromise until the latest moment. The authorities were too
late in their "proposals to look into all grievances." They
over-estimated the force of the insurgents, and under-estimated
the weight of the moral-force movement, failing to see the
expediency of a frank and earnest entertainment of the complaints
made so long and so constitutionally. Small at the best,
ill-organised, and ill-provided, the armed diggers' party would
have never had heart to take the position it did take had not the
authorities disarmed the larger body of peaceful agitators, and
provoked hostilities by the peculiarly despotic action taken in
the last license-collecting raid.</p>
<p>The Legislative Council, on the 6th December, presented an
address to his Excellency embodying the motion submitted by Mr.
Miller, and adopted almost unanimously by the House. Sir Charles
received the Council at Government House, himself and the chief
officers of State attired in the Windsor uniform. To the address
of the Council his Excellency read the following
reply:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen,&mdash;It is with no small
pride and satisfaction that at a moment of unusual difficulty the
Legislative Council of Victoria have assembled themselves around
the Governor, and enabled him to proclaim to the world that with
one voice, and one mind, and one heart, we are resolved to
maintain the law. I assure you, gentlemen, that my utmost
endeavors have been used to stave off and prevent the difficulty
which has arisen, but is now, I am thankful to say, rapidly
disappearing. I am desirous, if you will grant me time, to touch
upon these points lightly, in order to show to you that my words
are not lightly uttered, not spoken without some consideration.
Before the deputation came from the gold-fields, the Eureka riots
broke out, and the burning of Bentley's hotel ensued. Immediately
the discharge of Bentley and the other men was sent to the
Attorney-General [now ex Chief Justice Stawell], he saw that the
authorities had taken the wrong course, and he came out post
haste to Toorak, and recommended most strongly that the men who
had been prisoners should be again brought to trial. We had then
received no representative of any sort or kind from the diggers
of Ballarat. Immediately instructions were sent down to bring
Bentley and his associates to trial, and shortly after that we
heard that the fire had taken place at the Eureka hotel.<br>
<br>
Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen,&mdash;I wish to establish the fact,
that the Government had given orders to enquire into the manner
in which the former trial had been conducted before any
representative from the diggers of Ballarat had been received,
and before any violence had ensued.<br>
<br>
Of the trial of the men engaged in the burning of the hotel I
shall say but little, excepting to observe that the sentence was
most lenient.<br>
<br>
There were reasons which induced us to imagine that the conduct
of the authorities at Ballarat had not been entirely what it
ought to have been, and a commission was sent down with very
stringent instructions to enquire into the whole case, and bring
the offenders, of whatever degree they might be, prominently to
notice. The result of that enquiry was, the magistrate [Dewes]
was dismissed, the sergeant-major [Milne] was also dismissed (or
rather will be placed under punishment and then dismissed), and
that the coroner was most severely reprimanded for some
injudicious expressions which he made use of. Now, Mr. Speaker
and gentlemen, I do not think that that shows there was a
Government in power which was unwilling to listen to the voice of
the people.<br>
<br>
The commission returned, the military were withdrawn, and there
was every probable appearance of order and tranquility at those
diggings, when suddenly we found it necessary to send down an
overwhelming force in consequence of the reports we received from
Ballarat. The Camp was threatened, and reports reached us that
the Camp was not safe an hour, and then the time arrived when it
became absolutely necessary that some vigorous steps should be
taken and a decisive blow be struck. With regard to the opinion
which I formed of the manner in which the authorities acted, I
shall allow my own despatches to speak for
themselves.</blockquote>
<p>His Excellency then read copies of his dispatches to the
Resident-Commissioner at Ballarat, in which he approved the
action taken on the morning of the 3rd December, ordered secure
holding of the prisoners, announced the proclamation of martial
law, directed the apprehension of all the speakers at the
license-burning meeting, and enjoined "the propriety of
forbearance, caution, and temper towards the mining population,"
He continued:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I was anxious to have those dispatches read, to show
that whilst we have on the one hand endeavored to the utmost of
our power to uphold law and order, yet, the very moment it was
feasible, we revert to the original state of things; and martial
law, which is repugnant to every Englishman, and especially so to
every colonist, will cease as soon as possible, and I most
anxiously hope that there may not be again occasion to revert to
it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; I
am satisfied that the time for military law and rule by violence
has gone, never more to be recovered, and it ought not to be
recovered. But, gentlemen, the moment there is an outbreak, and
that caused, not by Englishmen, but by foreigners&mdash;men who
are not suffered to remain in their own countries in consequence
of the violence of their characters and the deeds they have
done&mdash;I, for one, say that whenever that happens, the
Englishmen of Victoria must rally round the Government, and must
to a man sink their private differences, and forget the causes of
difference which to Englishmen are inherent, and which, to a
certain extent, are the blessings of our Constitution, and must
rally round the authorities, liking or disliking them, and put
that outbreak down. As long as I am at the head of the Government
I will endeavor to prevent these foreigners agitating to disturb
the good order which generally exists in Victoria, and preventing
the honest and industrious portion of the population from
continuing at their work.
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;
We will redress all grievances, if possible, maintain order, and
keep prominently before us the fact that our endeavors will meet
with their reward in the way that the Legislative Council and the
Speaker at their head have shown.<br>
<br>
Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen,&mdash;I most cordially thank you for
your expressions of feeling, and I hope from the bottom of my
heart that whatever circumstances may arise, I may not be found
wanting.</blockquote>
<p>Good Yorkshire pluck at the bottom of the Yorkshire sailor's
heart, no doubt, but a terrible buzzing bee in his bonnet as to
"these foreigners". A seeming slip of the pen, too, about the
time for rule by violence being gone "never to be recovered", and
the slip is instantly corrected, for the time "ought not to be
recovered". Excellent sentiment! Had it been practised as well as
preached there had been no need of slaughtering men in the early
Sunday morning light, nor of the "overwhelming force", the
martial law, and all the abortive show of arrests, examinations,
and trials for high treason and sedition.</p>
<p>Sir Charles was energetic in the business of the time. Some of
the Government proclamations were written from end to end by his
own hand. He was also brave and honest, but it would seem there
never entered the head of that naval officer the conception that
he was dealing with a different body of men from those that
formed the laboring or even yeoman class upon his native wolds.
It is likely that he had been, like many English gentlemen of
rank and estates, accustomed to regard the masses as so much
rent-producing material. But he had to learn that Victorian
diggers were of quite different mettle. They were well described
in a letter of the Bendigo correspondent of the <i>Herald</i> on
the 30th November, who wrote of the Government officials and
diggers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>They have to meet hardy men, whose open-air
occupations, thorough independence, and well-trained sinews give
them a noble daring and a generous impetuosity. Free of all
masters, with a knowledge that they can obtain gold whenever they
choose to work, they possess all the self-reliance of the
mountaineers.</blockquote>
<p>Governor Hotham had learned nothing of the spirit of larger
freedom which was abroad here, and was soon to be begotten afresh
in the fatherland as we have seen it there since those days. He
appeared not to have divined the presence here of the germs of a
bold democracy, germs even then fast approaching the bursting
point under the united influence of a fertile soil and a
freedom-inspiring atmosphere, bursting into fruit, to be garnered
here and shared, through the sympathy of race and the quickening
of constant inter-communication, by the still struggling and ever
enfranchising people of the mother country. One open declaration
of a willingness to hear and enquire through the medium of men in
the confidence of the gold-fields population, would have sufficed
to prevent all the bloodshed and all the heart-burnings that
outlived the Eureka tragedy itself. But the Government would not
stoop to such a method of conquering its few enemies and of
assisting its multitudinous friends. Old country hauteur, with
new exasperations, were persevered in, blood was shed, and then
the Government gave all the diggers wanted, and Sir Charles
Hotham died, a victim to the anxieties caused by the troubles
that might have been avoided but for official blindness,
blindness that was fatal to life and peace for a time, but
powerless to hold back those rights which greater wisdom would
have earlier conceded.</p>
<p>The newspaper's of the day present to us a sorry procession to
the Ballarat Police-court on the 8th December and following days,
before Messrs. Sturt and Webster. The prisoners taken in and
about the Stockade were brought up, while their wounded comrades
still lay bleeding hard by in the rude Camp-hospital. There came
Timothy Hayes, large, portly, jovial, humorous, wayward, egoïste,
the Irish chairman of the Bakery Hill meetings, whom the military
arrested on their march back from the Stockade. He was not much
of a fighter, but he had a wife of spirit. Lieutenant Richards,
who ordered his arrest, deposed:&mdash;"After the arrest, the
prisoner's wife came up and said if she had been a man she would
not have allowed herself to have been taken. Then, addressing
witness, she said, 'why did you not come yesterday when the men
were ready for you.' "There came the little red-haired, fire-eyed
Italian, Raffaello to confront the "spy" Goodenough, his accuser.
Defeated, but not cowed, Raffaello shot lightnings of indignation
at the Crown witness, and afterwards wept tears of manly agony as
he was taken past his little tent on his way to trial at
Melbourne. No saintly shape, "robed in white samite", or radiant
with heavenly glory, ever appeared more pure than did the
diggers' cause to Raffaello's vision. Whatever else may be said
of him he was true to it, as he saw it, and to the last, even
when a tragical and inglorious end seemed a not improbable fate.
There came; also Manning, the <i>Ballarat Times</i> reporter, who
had thought the sword could better serve than the pen to right
the wrongs of the time. There came, too, another, the little
editor of big words, Seekamp. "<i>C'e un'uómo ardito sènza
prudènza</i>" <a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href=
"#fn15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Raffaello would have said. He
was accused of sedition. Editorial lunacy might have been as
appropriate an accusation. At least so it seems to the calmer
reason of later days. Some of Seekamp's wonderful deliverances
were read in court from the <i>Ballarat Times</i> of the 18th and
25th November. Here is one&mdash;<i>ex pede Herculem</i>.
<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#fn16" class=
"fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
<blockquote>It is not for us to say how much we have been
instrumental in rousing up the people to a sense of their wrongs;
we leave that to the public and the world.
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;
The coming Christmas is pregnant of change, for on next Wednesday
will be held such a meeting for a fixed determinate purpose as
was never before held in Australia. The Australian flag shall
triumphantly wave in the sunshine of its own blue and peerless
sky over thousands of Australia's adopted sons.
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;
And when the loud pæan of<br>
<div style="margin-left:20%;">Now's the day and now's the
hour,<br>
See the front of battle lour,</div>
shall have pierced the blue vaults of Australia's matchless sky,
from the brave men of Ballarat on next Wednesday at Bakery Hill,
there will not be one discordant voice in the sublime and heroic
chorus.
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;
Go forth indomitable people! gain your rights, and may the God of
creation smile down propitiously upon your glorious cause!
<span class="u">Forward People, Forward!</span></blockquote>
<p>Though such appeals as these serve now to provoke a smile,
they did not seem so ludicrous to the men whose blood was up in
those hot days of agitation. A wild feeling of poetry as well as
of anger fired the breasts of many then, and that which now reads
like fustian was at that time perused with tierce delight and
accelerated emotion. To judge from the <i>Herald</i> report the
dealing with Seekamp's exalted language lifted reporter and
printers above the common prose of business. The reporter calls
the presiding magistrate "his Lordship", and the printers mixed
up with the report two or three dreary paragraphs from the
painfully dry details of debate in the Legislative Council of the
previous day. Humffray, too, the cautious peace-advocate, may
have been inspired by the ardent phrases of the "seditious"
editor, for we shall see by-and-bye that even he infused some of
the music of sounding phrases into his first political address to
the Ballarat electors of the coming days. Lalor, the real chief,
and Vern, the supposed chief, of the insurgents, were still lying
under cover, with the Government rewards over their heads. Of
these something more anon. The magistrates committed the
prisoners for trial on the charges of treason and sedition.</p>
<p>Four days after the historic Sunday, a Royal Commission of
Enquiry, consisting of William Westgarth, chairman; John Pascoe
Fawkner, John Hodgson, John O'Shanassy, and James Ford Strachan,
members of the Legislative Council; and William H. Wright, Chief
Commissioner of Gold-fields, was appointed to investigate the
whole grounds of the agitation which had been thus tragical in
its results. On the 14th December the commissioners met at the
Imprest Office in Melbourne, and four days afterwards they opened
their commission at Bath's (now Craig's) hotel, Ballarat. The
evidence taken by the commissioners comprised a vast mass of
important information touching the wrongs and the requirements of
the diggers; and the report of the commissioners, while it
demonstrated the brutality of some of the subordinates, and the
folly of the authorities generally, and chid the excesses of the
insurgents, led to a speedy amelioration of the social and
political condition of the gold-fields population.</p>
<p>On All-Fool's Day, 1855&mdash;so grim, sometimes, is the irony
of the fates&mdash;the men arrested by the authorities and
indicted for high treason were acquitted, a fitting day on which
to record such a verdict upon the bloody business which had all
along been marked by much folly on both sides. There were
thirteen men arraigned by the Attorney-General's indictment of
treason. First named was Timothy Hayes, the bland chairman of the
Bakery Hill meetings. To him succeeded Carboni Raffaello, John
Manning, John Josephs, Jan Vennik, James Beattie, Henry Reed,
Michael Tuohy, James Macfie Campbell, William Molloy, Jacob
Soranson, Thomas Dignam, and John Phelan. Sixty-four witnesses
were set down in the Crown brief, and three panels of jurymen
numbering 178 men in all were summoned for the trial. Henry
Seekamp, the editor and proprietor of the <i>Ballarat Times</i>,
had been previously tried for sedition, and being found guilty,
"with a very strong recommendation to mercy," he was released on
his own recognisances. Seekamp was a little man, but a pugnacious
writer, and was often in trouble. He was said to write
occasionally under inspiration from the source whence tradition
tells us Dutchmen have drawn courage. He had some more judicious
editorial coadjutors later in his journalistic career, but at the
time of Westgarth's visit as chairman of the Royal Commission, it
was no wonder he could find cause to write afterwards&mdash;"We
found here a local newspaper&mdash;of course at war with the
authorities, local and general&mdash;and we amused ourselves with
the violent style of the 'leaders'." We shall have some further
glimpses of Seekamp by-and-bye.</p>
<p>The State prisoners were defended gratuitously by Mr. B.C.
Aspinall, who thus earned an honorable celebrity. With him in the
defence were several of our foremost barristers. A general
amnesty, in effect, followed the acquittal, and the Government
even compensated both friends and foes who had suffered. Lalor,
the chief man of war, and Humffray, the leading man of peace, on
the popular side, were returned to the first Parliament held
under the new Constitution which, with all their follies and
excesses, the lighting men of the insurgents had done so much to
obtain, and which the men of peace have done so much more to
consolidate and improve. Humffray was the first Minister of
Mines, a new department of the State for the control of the chief
industrial industry of the colony. The department has not proved
so useful as was expected, and public opinion, which had seen the
actual power to lie mainly in the hands of Mr. Brough Smyth, at
that time the Secretary for Mines, has here and there, grown in
favor of an abolition of the department, and its inclusion in the
lands department, Mr. Dow, the present Minister of Lands,
advocating that policy when in Ballarat last March. Lalor has
held a seat in Parliament from the date of his first election
until the present day, and for a long period held salaried office
as Chairman of Committees in the Legislative Assembly, he filled
that office with credit to himself and the House, as he has since
then the higher office of Speaker, and whatever may be said
against him it will be admitted that he has shown practical and
suggestive, if not constructive, faculty as a legislator. He
became, with occasional vacillations, one of the most
conservative, that is, constitutional, members of Parliament; as
if, so to speak, justifying his resolute rebellion under arms by
his general steady maintenance in peace of that constitutional
freedom which he and his colleagues of the Stockade fought to
obtain. The next chapter, however, will refer more in detail to
political affairs.</p>
<p>The insurgent commander at the time of the Stockade collision
was in the prime of early manhood, and his brown hair, blue-grey
eyes, broad face, and rather heavy brows were those of a handsome
presence. Not more than about twenty-five years old, full six
feet in stature, broad-chested, and generally well-proportioned,
and possessing a rather impulsive temperament, he was just the
man to embody the physical-force-spirit of the movement.
Raffaello was a shrewd restless little man, nearly forty years
old, under the middle height, with reddish hair and red beard cut
short, and small hazel eyes that had ever a fiery twinkle beneath
a broad forehead and rather shaggy eyebrows. An Italian, a
Catholic, possessing others besides his mother tongue, his
sanguine temperament pushed him into the thickest of the
struggle, and his political sympathies being democratic and
unmixed with English leanings, he was one of the readiest to
carry the rising to the extreme limit of revolution. Humffray was
then a young man, too, possessing the patriotism and more than
usual of the caution of Welshmen. Darker in complexion than
either Lalor or Raffaello, he also differed from them in stature.
He was about the middle height, moderately stout in frame, and
had a well poised head and a comely face. His voice was musical,
and he possessed a readiness of utterance which made him one of
the foremost of the advocates of peaceable reform. To that phase
of the struggle he adhered, but his caution at times led him to
cross the more ardent purposes of others, who used to accuse him
of trimming&mdash;an ancient and easy method of denouncing, and
often of no worth. In this case there seems no ground for
supposing Humffray ever to have been disposed either to abandon a
legitimate, or to sanction an illegitimate agitation for a
redress of grievances. Vern was a Hanoverian, warm, rough,
uncertain, without the discretion, weight, and tact that Lalor
possessed.</p>
<p>John Fraser, an early gold-hunter, whom we shall meet again
by-and-bye, in more pacific and more civilised times, gives the
following revelation about Vern's movements:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>One of the foremost to incite the diggers to use
physical force was Frederick Vern. I first saw him at a meeting
on Bakery Hill. Mounting the stump, he soon attracted attention
by the bitterness of his invectives against the Government as
"tyrants" and "oppressors", vowing that he would never become the
slave of despotism. Shortly afterwards I saw him again, when the
soldiers and police were skirmishing among the holes on Gum Tree
Flat, in search of unlicensed diggers: then he appeared among the
crowd with a long sword by his side. There were grave doubts of
the sincerity and pluck of this foreigner, who could so glibly
talk about "despotism", as if he had only discovered its
existence on his arrival in a British colony. It appeared to me
that, if anything, there was more bluster than genuine courage in
the man; and my subsequent experience of him did not alter that
opinion. For several months prior to the Stockade encounter, our
party, consisting of Edmund Strange, Joseph Butler, George
Norgate, Walter Parling, Peter, the baker, and myself, had been
camping together on Dalton's Flat. We were shepherding, and
occasionally working at a claim we owned on the Gum Tree Flat, at
the same time doing a little fossicking on Dalton's Flat to keep
up supplies. Only one of our party, Walter Parling, took an
active part in the insurgent proceedings. More ardent than the
rest, he enrolled himself in one of the companies formed to bear
arms, and was frequently absent of a night attending to his
drill. On Saturday evening, the 2nd December, he left, as usual,
after supper, to go to the Stockade. About one o'clock a.m. he
came home to bed, telling us, as he was undressing, that he had
been put on sentry duty somewhere on the Melbourne Road; that he
had stayed there two or three hours, and, finding himself very
lonely and sleepy, he had made tracks for home. He felt confident
he would not be wanted that night. He was mistaken. At early dawn
we were all awakened by the sound of firing in the direction of
the Stockade. Hastily dressing, we went to the summit of the rise
north of Pennyweight Flat. Columns of smoke could be seen in the
vicinity of the Stockade, as if a number of the tents were on
fire. Troopers could also be seen rushing about in various
directions in the distance; but what alarmed us the most was the
peculiar sound of bullets whizzing over our heads, or on either
side of us. Had we gone on, we would doubtless have shared the
fate of other passive spectators, who were so ruthlessly shot
down by the infuriated troopers. Shortly after returning to our
tent, stragglers from the neighborhood of the Stockade, some of
them in a state of the greatest terror and excitement, came
hurrying along close to the tents. An Irishman stopped a few
minutes to be supplied with a drink of water. He had his wife and
three little children with him. The poor woman, crying bitterly,
presented to our mind a picture of distress, as, nursing her
infant in her arms, she bewailed in heartrending tones the loss
of all their little possessions&mdash;tent, clothes,
everything&mdash;burnt and destroyed by the troopers. On the
following day I decided to accompany my mate Strange and his
brother to Geelong, and remain there a few days. We found the
people there greatly excited over the news of the fight. On the
third day, hearing that matters had settled down quietly on
Ballarat, we went back, and were met outside the tent by our
mates, who mysteriously whispered to us that one of the insurgent
leaders was concealed in our tent. On entering we were surprised
to see, reclining on my bed, which he had occupied during my
absence, the man whose name was in nearly everybody's mouth, the
man for whose arrest the authorities were offering £500, dead or
alive&mdash;Frederick Vern! At his request, we pledged ourselves,
as the others had done, to shelter and provide for him, and keep
his concealment a profound secret until he could regain his
freedom, or escape. Every morning on leaving to go to work we
carefully closed the entrance to the tent, so that even our
acquaintances in the neighborhood would not attempt to enter
during our absence. At one of our evening meetings it was
suggested that a letter to the Press should be written by Vern,
or in his name, announcing his departure from Australia. It was
argued that such a letter would have the effect of misleading the
authorities, and probably cause them to abandon their search for
him. This idea was at once carried out, with the result that
"Vern's Farewell to Victoria" was concocted and forthwith
despatched to one of the papers&mdash;I forget which. [It
appeared in the <i>Age</i>, and was dated from "Port Phillip
Heads".] I was his amanuensis, and he graciously permitted me to
do a little of the composing. In due time, I procured for him a
copy of the paper in which this precious epistle appeared, and
his delight in reading it in print was unqualified. He declared,
with his usual emphasis, "that he was certain he would now be
able to elude the tyrants' vigilance, and return at some future
time to fight for the glorious cause of Liberty and Equality," An
incident occurred a day or two afterwards which severely tested
the strength of his nerves. The day being very hot, we were
sitting together in the shade of the entrance to the tent, when
four troopers were observed by one of us to be leaving the track
over in the flat and making direct for our tent. Not a moment
could be lost. Vern plunged under one of the bunks, a rug or two
was hastily thrown on the edge to hide him from view, and just as
these arrangements were completed the troopers rode up to the
tent. Our agitation increased when we saw two of them dismount
and enter the tent for a drink and a smoke. We were all immensely
relieved when at last they bade us good day. As soon as we
reported them out of sight, Vern emerged from his hiding place.
His face was ashy pale; he trembled in every limb, and it was
some time before he could manage to articulate. When his terror
had partially subsided, he told us, in broken accents, "that he
really thought it was all up with him." Having no money, Vern
decided to apply to a lady friend for a loan, and sent me with a
letter to Mrs. Spanhake, of the Duchess of Kent hotel. Main Road.
As soon as that lady learnt that her friend and countryman was
still on Ballarat, and not as she and others supposed on his way
to Europe, she evinced the greatest anxiety on his account. She
gave me three sovereigns to deliver to Vern, with strict
injunctions to him not to venture from his place of concealment
on any account until all danger was gone. On receiving this
message, its effect on Vern was just the reverse of what she
intended. It appeared to awaken an irresistible desire to pay her
a visit; so a few nights afterwards a scheme was adopted to
enable him to gratify his wish. A female neighbor, a tall bony
Scotch woman, who had been let into our confidence, supplied us
with a dress, bonnet, and shawl, and a few accessories to
complete Vern's disguise. Thus attired, he went down town,
accompanied by Butler. They returned safely about midnight, and
several other trips to the same place were made afterwards, but
under another disguise. About the end of February, Vern began to
express impatience at being kept so long a prisoner, as he termed
it, and announced his intention of trying to find his way to
Melbourne, where, he said, he had faithful friends who would
gladly shelter him. Having borrowed a pound from me&mdash;nearly
all I had at the time&mdash;and five pounds from Parling, he took
his departure one bright moonlight Sunday night, to make his way
by the most unfrequented tracks to Melbourne. He solemnly
promised to refund the money he had borrowed at the earliest
opportunity, and when he was once more a free man he would
handsomely reward those who had with so much fidelity screened
him for so long. The old Scotch woman who had lent him her
clothes shed tears copiously, and so we parted. We had no tidings
of him for several months. At last we heard he was on Ballarat;
that he appeared to have plenty of money, and was doing the grand
among his friends. As he had not considered it necessary to pay
us a visit, our mate Parling resolved to demand his five pounds.
A day or two afterwards Vern called on us, but made no mention of
his indebtedness, until reminded by Strange. Assuming an air of
being offended, he pulled out a roll of notes from his pocket,
and, flinging one on the ground, haughtily exclaimed, "There,
Fraser, take your pound; I am out of your debt now." Seeing that
I declined to pick up the money, Strange, whose temper was
getting ruffled, sternly asked Vern if that was the way he had
received the money, and demanded that he should pick the note up
and pay his debt in a proper manner. Knowing that Strange was not
a man to be trifled with, Vern awkwardly complied, at the same
time muttering an apology when handing me the note, and haughtily
strode away without another word. Parling happened to be away at
work, and so missed that chance of getting his money also. Seeing
Vern some time afterwards, Parling asked him for payment, but was
met by a flat refusal. Parling then informed him that he would
take it out of him at the rate of £1 at a time, and proceeded at
once to take out the first instalment. He succeeded in getting
the second and third in satisfaction, and doubtless would have
insisted on taking out the other two instalments, but poor
Parling was killed shortly afterwards in a claim at Buninyong,
and so Vern escaped the finishing chastisement he so richly
deserved. Such are a few of my recollections of that strangely
diversified character&mdash;Frederick Vern.</blockquote>
<p>Vern had a large ambition for cheap military glory, and, like
the great Napoleon, had a stern unconquerable scorn of facts.
Emerson says, somewhere, that Napoleon's genius was boundless in
that direction, and before us lie letters in Vern's hand which
demonstrate his great ability and daring in that peculiar walk of
life. And this, too, while he declares in one of the letters that
his motto had "always been <i>fiat justitia et si pereat
mundus</i>." <a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href=
"#fn17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> But Vern may be credible
sometimes, nevertheless. In a letter to the <i>Star</i>, dated
2nd October, 1856, he defends Humffray from charges of "treason"
against the diggers, and says he was one of the first to attend
on Ross when wounded, besides having kept Vern's hiding place
secret when he could have had £500 for revealing it. To those who
were intimate with the men and the time, the following
letter&mdash;a literal copy&mdash;will be regarded as
characteristic of the writer's general frame of mind:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Mr. Lalor.<br>
<div style="margin-left:10%;">My dearest friend!</div>
<br>
Once more enjoying the blessings of freedom, and having returned
to the colony free from danger, I hasten to address you. I hear
that you was seriously wounded and maimed for life. We are taking
steps to subscribe in Melbourne for a man who has so bravely
risked his life in defence of the miner's rights. My friend,
would to Heaven you had taken my advice on Friday, or would to
Heaven we would have had men more true and honorable in our
ranks. I have positive information, and hold a correspondence in
my hands now, from an officer in the insurgent army, and Mr.
Furnell, late of H.M.A.&mdash;as soon as I can fathem the
infamous plot, I shall avenge the murder of Ross and Capt. Potts,
late of our ranks, and the world will be to hot to hold me and
Lieut. Col. M.<br>
<br>
Did you read my letter dated Albury, signed E.W. and S.F., it was
a reply to Capt. Thomas' despatch. I am sorry that it should have
cost 22 lives, or 23 including Capt. Pott's, to convince the
diggers of the ridiculous absurds of such a foolish outbreak as
the late Ballarat affair. Do you remember the delegates from
Slaty Creek and their letter, as also M'Gill's reply to that
letter, I have it from the best authority, that that was a plot.
We was sold to the government for £800. Would to God I had
seceded from the movement, or that you had taken my advice, and
been discreet in your trust to strangers.<br>
<br>
I charge M'Gill with treason before God and men, and woe to him
if we meet again. I wish I had never accepted the command after
your resignation on Saturday morning, and then Sir Toorak could
never have offred £500 for my apprehension. The affair has
produced good, but what a cruel, useless, wantan sacrifice of
humane life did it involve. You have seen now that my advice was
good, and that it was to permature a period for such a movement
as you unfortunately provoked. Vengeance is now the only thing
that is left to me, and I shall do my duty cooly but not
foolishly.</blockquote>
<div style="text-align:right;">

<blockquote>Melbourne, 7 | 4 | 55.</blockquote>
<br>
<p>This letter shows a little of what Raffaello calls
"sky-blathering", for Vern was one of the wildest and least
reliable of the physical force party. Lalor did not surrender,
nor Vern accept the command. The letter is a raving symptom of
Vern's delight in illusions. When peace returned Vern took to
mining, and in 1856 he was tried in Ballarat for "rioting at
Black Lead on the 7th April," and sentenced to three months'
imprisonment. The so-called riot was a combination, actively
exerted, to fill up the holes sunk by "jumpers" upon claims held
under the frontage regulations, then just become law. One of the
witnesses at the trial said&mdash;"I heard Vern say, 'If any man
stops us from tilling up the claims, I shall make a dead cock of
him, by my God!' At the same time he pulled out a revolver." They
were out-spoken men in those days here.</p>
<p>Vern was a voluminous writer to the newspapers of the times,
and in a letter to the <i>Star</i>&mdash;he explains how
Humffray, while pleading for Vern and others with the Government,
was summoned as a Crown witness. He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Allow me also to say that this incident never caused
Vern the least uneasiness, inasmuch as Humffray had proved
himself his best and truest friend. I think the strongest proof
of this is, that <i>Mr. Humffray knew Vern's retreat, came daily
to sec him, and performed for him all those little offices of
friendship</i> which his unfortunate situation required, and that
at a time when he could have made £500 by betraying Vern. This
constitutes Mr. Humffray's <i>treason! What a serious
offence!</i> Surely, after this, Mr. Humffray will be deemed
anything but a traitor! <i>Humffray, indeed, was live rebel's
best and truest friend</i>. Humffray, also, was the first man
that came to the assistance of our lamented friend
Ross.</blockquote>
<p>He also wrote as a friend to Mr. Thomas Loader, when Loader
was a candidate for Grant. Loader, seeing a letter by Vern in the
papers in which another character was assumed, wrote to the
<i>Star</i>, enclosing Vern's note to him, and the <i>Star</i>
editor sums up the matter thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Some men are badly used. Mr. Vern is so. He sends us
a letter referring to Mr. Humffray; we publish that letter
knowing it to be genuine. Mr. Loader hands us another which had
been sent to him. This we also believe and know to be genuine and
publish it. Again Mr. Vern sends us a letter&mdash;the present
one&mdash;disavowing the authorship of the one to Mr. Loader. We
believe and know it to be genuine and publish it. The public can
judge for themselves&mdash;<i>the three letters are from the same
pen</i>. We have shown the letters (which are still in our
possession and open to the inspection of the curious) to friends
of both Mr. Humffray and Mr. Loader, and they agree with us that
either all the letters are genuine or they are
forgeries&mdash;take your choice, Mr. Vern, of either
alternative. Mr. Vern's courage has become proverbial, his
truthfulness is now deserving of an equally honorable
distinction.</blockquote>
<p>Vern does not seem to have made any response to this
revelation. As has been said, he was intrepid. But too much has
already been said respecting this singular actor in the Ballarat
rising.</p>
<p>Black had a light complexion, was tall, thin, sanguine,
gentlemanly, irresolute; but, the occasional perturbations of
some "sin of fear" apart, was true and faithful as became a
gentleman, and one having, in the Raffaello dialect, "a belief in
the resurrection of life." M'Gill was a young American, fuller of
ardor than of trusty courage and sagacity. Ross was of another
stamp; he was a Canadian, bold, brave, and trusty: about
twenty-eight years old, of middle height, true as the steel of
the axe that felled his native forests, he was one of the best
loved men of those that fell. He was shot in the attack on the
Sunday morning, and was removed by friends to the Star hotel that
then stood in Main street, where he soon died. Esmond was another
who, with a few others, took the more prominent positions in the
struggle. His prominence was only comparative, and was
essentially local. Hayes had a genius for exploration, and the
airy flights of change were more seductive to him than the
"demnition grind" of dull prosaic life in the whim-round of
humdrum methodical duty. After the tragic comedy of the Stockade
time, he declined upon the less romantic occupation of town
inspector for Ballarat East, but private urgencies projected him
upon the quest of fresh woods and new pastures, and he threw up
his municipal prose for the poetry of life in the lands of Chili
or Brazil. He took with him an honorable discharge from office,
duly attested by the big seal of the municipality, and it seems
that he bore with him also some mystic military charm as from the
post Bakery Hill meeting days, when oratory had got translated
into pikes and revolvers and muskets. For the town inspector of
Ballarat East blossomed forth in Chili or Brazil as an authority
upon military engineering, and he was employed by the bellicose
people of those latitudes as an inspector of fortifications, on
which he was to report forthwith, since trouble on the frontier
was expected as a result of the war between the Southern and
Northern States of America. How our hero came out of that exploit
does not transpire, but he appeared after a while in San
Francisco, where he sought to coalesce with Sweeney, once an
auctioneer and municipal man in Ballarat East. Sweeney, it was
said, had made a pile of dollars by buying horses and selling
them to the Unionists or Confederates, or both; but instead of a
coalition, there was a collision between the whilom Ballarat
chums, and Tim, around whom his brother Freemasons had helpfully
rallied within the Golden Gate, returned with larger experience
to Victoria. He figured for a while as a railway hand in some
capacity in Melbourne, his portly presence adorning the
metropolitan halls and thoroughfares in his hours of leisure. And
there he died, and so we will hope that he, too, sleeps well
after his life's fitful fever.</p>
<p>In March, 1856, a return of the cost of the strife between the
insurgents and the Government was laid before Parliament. The
Deputy-Commissary General's figures showed the military
expenditure to be £26,733 18s. 6d., which, by deducting the cost
of the military in Melbourne on their ordinary footing, was
reduced to £12,050. To this were added extra police charges, and
the sum of £4689 4s. voted in compensation to sufferers. With
regard to the compensation voted, it is to be remarked that Lalor
and Humffray both interposed on behalf of the claimants. Lalor
was specially active. The <i>Star</i> on the 22nd and 25th March,
1856, had the following reference to the part taken by the
insurgent chief, then become a representative of the gold-field
in Parliament:&mdash;</p>

<br>
<blockquote>To Mr. Lalor's exertions we must attribute this
successful result.
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;
We can only consider as an additional grace to the triumph, that
he who was the foremost to defend our rights, has also been the
principal instrument in recovering compensation for wrongs
inflicted.</blockquote>
<p>On the 22nd November, 1855, a meeting was held on the site of
the Stockade, Daniel Sweeney in the chair, "to consider the
subject of compensation to the sufferers for the losses sustained
by those who had their tents burned down and their stores and
dwellings wantonly and ruthlessly destroyed by the military and
police on the memorable 3rd December." And on the first
anniversary of that day the fiery, lachrymose, faithful Raffaello
was again on the spot offering for sale the first pages of his
work, "The Eureka Stockade", which he had just brought up from
Melbourne. He sat there till the sun went down, a modern Marius,
with an eye to literary business. "He says (<i>vide Star</i>) he
will receive from Melbourne 1000 copies more, and as the price is
only 5s., all will have it in their power to purchase an
interesting account of the Ballarat disturbances." "Great works",
as he was called, from one of his favorite exclamations, sat
there selling his writing and wailing his "<i>perdidi spem</i>"
<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#fn18" class=
"fnanchor">[18]</a> not perceiving that a splendid social and
political victory had been won in that sorry military defeat at
the Stockade twelve months before.</p>
<p>On the 3rd December, 1856, there was a small procession to the
site of the Stockade, about two hundred people assembling. Mr.
John Lynch, who was a mining surveyor, a native of Ireland, and
one of Lalor's captains in the Stockade, mounted a tree-stump and
read an oration, the opening sentence of which was as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Sensible of the debt of gratitude we owe to the
memories of the brave men who fell victims on the fatal 3rd
December, 1854, in their efforts to resist the oppression and
tyranny of the then existing Government, we meet here to-day, the
second anniversary of that disastrous day, in solemn procession,
to pay to their manes the only tribute in our power, the
celebrating with due solemnity the sad commemoration of their
martyrdom.</blockquote>
<p>When Lynch's oration was finished, a march was made to the
cemetery. The <i>Star</i> of that day reads thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The persons present formed in procession, two and
two, headed by Mr. Esmond, carrying a pole draped in sable, with
black crape streamers. Next came Messrs. Seekamp and Lessmann,
bearing garlands of flowers, and followed by the committee and
the general procession. Nearly all the persons present wore crape
on the left arm, and many more also wore crape on their hats. As
the procession proceeded along the Eureka and Main road its
numbers swelled to nearly three hundred, the line reaching from
the Colonial Bank to the bridge, while numerous outsiders
accompanied the processionists. Arrived at the cemetery, the
procession walked round the spot where the bodies of the men who
fell on the fatal Sunday morning are interred, and, returning to
the monument erected to their memory, the apex of the monument
was crowned with the garlands borne in procession. An oration by
Dr. Hambrook followed, every person standing with head
uncovered.</blockquote>
<p>At this time the enthusiasm of the days of agitation had not
all disappeared. There were left swelling bosoms and big words
that the least opportunity brought into play. An emotional writer
in the <i>Star</i> of the 9th February, 1856, drawing attention
to a meeting, to be held that day on Bakery Hill, to discuss
measures for the erection of a monument to the men who fell at
the Stockade, ended his appeal with the following burst of
fervor:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The man on Ballarat who fails to swell to-day's
meeting should be, in its most perfect reality of chains,
dungeons, and degredation, a victim of slavery!</blockquote>
<p>It does not appear that the enthusiasm of the time was very
practical, for the only monument ever erected was a gift by the
man who constructed it and undertook its erection. Oratory,
however, was cheap, and at that time most of it was, no doubt, as
sincere at the moment as it was plentiful.</p>
<p>In a despatch by Deputy Adjutant-General Macarthur we read of
Captain Wise that "his remains are to be buried with the honors
due to his rank, in the graveyard at Ballarat gold-field, beside
those of the three other meritorious soldiers which lie there
interred." Alas! for years the honors were not very gratefully
echoed by survivors. Mr. Westgarth was in Ballarat on that day.
He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The day was hot and dusty as the cortege moved along
to the place of burial, a slightly rising ground nearly a mile
from the township. This rural cemetery was still wild and open,
no fence having as yet been placed around it, for even this is an
expensive process at a gold-field. But some excuse appeared for
this apparent negligence, for the ground had evidently been but
recently devoted to its present purpose, as the small number of
graves amongst a large population indicated.</blockquote>
<p>Since that time the city has spread out its arms all around
the "rural cemetery". The place has been enclosed; it has
well-kept paths, flower borders, handsome monuments, and it is
crowded to overflowing with those who have fallen in this part
of</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">The world's broad field of
battle.</p>
<p>There is, too, a new and larger cemetery now, enclosed,
ornamented, and already in part peopled with the silent ones. The
place in the old cemetery where the military were buried was long
like a neglected wilderness, a disgrace to the place, and all
around spoke of neglect and ruin. In 1879, when Mr. William
Collard Smith, then major, now a retired colonel, in the
Victorian volunteer service, was a member of the Victorian
Government, the burial place of the soldiers, after many appeals
and remonstrances from old pioneers of the gold-field, was
enclosed with a stone dwarf wall and iron fence. The ground was
planted, the graves adorned with flowers, and the decaying
original headstones and tablets alone spoke then of the passage
of the intervening years. In the middle of the ground a freestone
obelisk was erected upon a pedestal, and on the east and west
faces of the obelisk two marble slabs were inserted, scrolls on
each face of the freestone carrying the word "Victoria", and on
the north and south sides the word "Duty" was carved beneath.
Upon the marble slab facing east, as if looking towards the spot
where the buried soldiers did their "duty", and fell in doing it,
is the following inscription from the pen of this
author:&mdash;"In this place, with other soldiers and civilians
of the military camp then in Ballarat, were buried the remains of
the British soldiers, Henry Christopher Wise, captain, Michael
Roney, and Joseph Wall, privates of the 40th Regt., and William
Webb, Felix Boyle, and John Wall, privates of the 12th Regt., who
fell dead or fatally wounded at the Eureka Stockade, in brave
devotion to duty, on Sunday, the 3rd day of December, 1854,
whilst attacking a band of aggrieved diggers in arms against what
they regarded as a tyrannous administration." The original draft
read "insurgent" instead of "aggrieved", but the Minister in
office rejected the original word as a reflection upon the
diggers whose survivors' suffrages helped to make members of
Parliament, and, potentially, Ministers of the Crown. Upon the
same marble slab, beneath the inscription just quoted, and from
the same pen, are the following memorial words:&mdash;"Not far
west from this spot lie the remains of some of the diggers who
fell in the courageous but misdirected endeavor to secure the
freedom which soon after came in the form of manhood suffrage and
constitutional government." Upon the slab facing west are the
following words:&mdash;"This monument and the enclosing fence
were erected <span class="a">Anno Domini</span> <span class=
"a">mdccclxxix</span>. by the Government of Victoria at the
request of the citizens of Ballarat." The sexton takes care of
the enclosure now, and the smaller one where the bodies of the
diggers lie was not long since repaired by private subscription.
As long as men of the Fifties survive, the memory of the dead
Stockaders will be kept green, and the little burial place and
its monument will, let us hope, be preserved from shameful
neglect. But the old pioneers are fast passing away to the same
silences as the sturdy insurgents of the fatal Sunday long ago
reached, and who will keep the place of graves when all are gone?
Let the men of the future do their duty as the buried soldiers
and diggers did theirs, and both of these mortuary memorials will
be preserved to be at once a tribute to heroic dutifulness and
heroic resistance, and an incentive for all time to emulation of
the same virtues in similar circumstances if, which Heaven
forfend, they should ever arise. The diggers' monument is a grey
sandstone obelisk, surmounted by a draped urn, and resting on a
bluestone base. The west face bears the following
inscription:&mdash;"Sacred to the memory of those who fell on the
memorable 3rd of December, 1854, in resisting the
unconstitutional proceedings of the Victorian Government. This
monument was presented by James Leggatt, Geelong, to the people
of Ballarat, and by them erected on the 22nd March, 1856." The
other three faces have the following inscriptions:&mdash;"John
Haynes, Co. Clare, Ireland; Patrick Gittings, Co. Kilkenny,
Ireland; Thos. Mullin, Co. Kilkenny, Ireland; Samuel Green,
England; John Robertson, Scotland; Edward Thonen, Elbertfeltdt,
Prussia; John Dimand, Co. Clare, Ireland; Thos. O'Neill, Co.
Kilkenny, Ireland; John Donaghey, Co. Donegal, Ireland; William
Clifton, age 30, native of Bristol; Ed. Quinn, Co. Cavan,
Ireland; Wm. Quinlan, Goulbourn, N.S. Wales; Wm. Emmerman,
Hanover; Lt. Ross, Canada; Thaddeus Moore, Co. Clare, Ireland;
James Brown, Newry, Ireland; Robert Jullien, Nova
Scotia;&mdash;Crowe, Scotland;&mdash;Fenton, England; Edward
McGlynn, Ireland." Between the two monuments, but close on the
west side of the soldiers' memorial, is a plain truncated column
of bluestone on a bluestone pedestal, enclosed by a chain fixed
to four low bluestone posts. The pedestal has inserted on the
east side a marble slab with this inscription:&mdash;"In memory
of James Scobie, who met with a premature death on 'Eureka',
October 7th, 1854. Erected by his brother George."</p>
<p>On the 16th April, 1884, a meeting was held at Craig's hotel
to consider how best to erect a permanent monument to mark the
site of the Eureka Stockade. A committee was appointed, with Mr.
A.T. Morrison honorary secretary and treasurer. The Eastern
Council concurring, a design by Mr. H.A. King, C.E., was chosen.
The monument is an octagonal body of bluestone ashlar work in two
tiers, with a flight of stone steps leading to the top, where,
upon a massive bed of ashlar bluestone, is a cube of the same
material, surmounted by a bluestone monolith twelve feet high. At
the angles of the lower platform are to be placed four 64-pounder
guns, contributed to the memorial by the Victorian Defence
Department. The bluestone cube bears the
inscription:&mdash;"Eureka Stockade, Sunday morning, December
3rd, 1854." On the 3rd December, 1884, the committee visited the
then partially erected memorial as a mark of respect to the dead,
and on Friday, 27th August, 1886, the still unfinished monument
was formally handed over to the Town Council of Ballarat East,
that body recording its acceptance in the following
resolution:&mdash;"That the council recognise the efforts of
these gentlemen in a public manner, and accept the work so well
begun as a gift to the corporation, and that this corporation
will finish and maintain it for all time." The council has not
yet performed its contract, but a fence has been erected round
the monument, and the enclosure is to be further ornamented by
the planting of trees and shrubs. After the lapse of thirty
years, some difficulty was at first met with in identifying the
exact site of the Stockade, and the spot on which the monument is
placed was chosen by the general agreement of many of the diggers
and others who were either present at the encounter between the
troops and the insurgents, or were at that time familiar with the
Stockade and its surroundings. The builders of the monument were
Rowsell and Son, the cost of stone and earthworks being £286 4s.,
raised by public subscriptions, organised and in part contributed
by the honorary secretary and treasurer, and the
committee&mdash;Messrs. Hickman, Ferguson, Salter, Lewis, Roff,
Williams, Béchervaise, Spain, Josephs, Wilson, Dyte, and
Hall.</p>
<p>In the Legislative Assembly, on the 31st of May, 1870, while
the House was discussing a vote for the Nelson, ship, Mr. Frazer
said "he had been informed that the flag unfurled on board the
Nelson was the identical flag that was flying over the Eureka
Stockade at the time of the riot. (Laughter.) The flag in
question was subsequently stolen from the court, and had never
since been found." This is possible, perhaps, but hardly
probable. The flag was hauled down by trooper, or policeman, John
King, who, in 1870, was Living in or near Warrnambool. King was a
native of Mayo, Ireland, and he gave the flag, or what was left
of it&mdash;for it was much torn, and was also lessened by
relic-hunters taking bits of it&mdash;to Inspector P.H. Smith,
who also was a Mayo man. Smith died in Melbourne, but where the
flag is the author has not been able to learn.</p>
<p>Mr. Blanchard, who was at that time a compositor on the
<i>Ballarat Times</i>, informs the author that after the fight on
the Sunday, the soldiers had the diggers' flag hoisted on a pole
at the Soldiers' Hill camp, and were dancing round it as if wild
with joy and grog.</p>
<p>On the last day of the year 1855, at half-past twelve o'clock
of the day, Sir Charles Hotham died at Toorak. His disease was
dysentery, and his death was attributed to the harassing
anxieties which accompanied the crisis. He is the only Victorian
Governor who has yet died while in office here. His remains were
buried in Melbourne. Governor Hotham failed, no doubt, to
understand the gold-digging population. His mistakes were due to
a want of sympathy with the democratic instinct inherent in all
aggregations of free British colonists. His intentions, we may
well believe, were to do his duty dutifully. That duty he
conceived to be to rule with a high hand a people whom, though
complimented by him upon occasion as peaceable and law-abiding,
he practically regarded as a froward race of vagabond
gold-hunters, mixed with demagogues and escaped and liberated
convicts from the adjacent penal settlements. What wonder, then,
that he, an aristocrat, a naval officer used to peremptory
command, with such views heightened, too, by occasional excesses
of language and action amongst the miners, should fail to
comprehend all at once the policy required for the redress of
wrongs which some of his own subordinates on the gold-fields had
first intensified and then misrepresented. Divining only a part
of the truth. Sir Charles Hotham was betrayed into a
misconception of the crisis. As his predecessor had discovered
"designing" men in the journalists of his day, so Governor Hotham
found the gold-fields troubles to be the product of the schemes
of "disaffected" men, and that idea whelmed all other conceptions
of the causes of the outbreak. The Governor was partially right.
There were among the insurgents men who hated British rule with a
hereditary hatred. There were Irishmen who felt that feeling, and
there were foreigners who had no special sympathy, if any at all,
with British government; but even those men never desired or
aimed at rebellion until they were maddened with the excitement
of the agitation which sought, at least in its earlier stages,
nothing but the clear and rational redress of plain and insulting
wrongs. Here, even those who elsewhere may have been the least
loyal were disposed to peace and submission, no matter whence
they came, and it was nothing but the haughty folly of officials
that precipitated what has been called rebellion; for it was
clear to demonstration that it was not so much the law, or the
want of law, as the unwise administration of law that provoked
the rising of the gold-fields population.</p>
<p>Since the first edition of this History was published, the
author has had opportunity for fuller examination of the evidence
touching the parts borne by Sir Charles Hotham and Mr. Secretary
Foster, and the irresistible conclusion is that the Governor, and
not the Secretary, was the person directly responsible for the
later severity of the enforcing of the hateful license law. The
testimony of witnesses examined before the Select Committee,
referred to by Irwin, is overwhelming in that direction. That
committee sat in 1867 to consider Mr. Foster's&mdash;by that time
he had assumed Fitzgerald as the ultimate one of several
names&mdash;claims to a pension or compensation for his
resignation of office at the time of the Eureka Stockade, and on
the 11th July of that year the committee agreed upon its report,
finding that Foster resigned on the 9th December, 1854, that he
resigned voluntarily because "a prejudice, which he alleged to be
without foundation, had arisen against him on the part of the
miners," and that the evidence "did not warrant the conclusion
that the discontent then existing on the gold-fields resulted
from a policy for which he was responsible." The committee might
have gone further than that, and included most of the
gold-fields' commissioners in the same bill of acquittal. Foster
shows that the Governor ignored him and his officers generally,
took outside advice, issued peremptory orders on his own mere
motion, and both Foster and other witnesses show that just before
the attack upon the Eureka Stockade, the Governor held direct
correspondence in cypher with some of the commissioners, passing
by not only the Colonial Secretary Foster, but the Chief
Commissioner Wright. Foster and Wright both held the licence to
be a blunder, and advised an export duty on gold instead, and
this was the view almost universally held by the commissioners on
the gold-fields, than whom none should have been better able to
judge of the merit of the law they had to enforce. The notable
order of the 13th September, 1854, instructing the commissioners
to go out twice a week in quest of unlicensed diggers, was the
Governor's own work, given without consultation with any of his
officers, and was the outcome of his persuasion that an export
duty meant smuggling, and that the enforcing of the law had not
been as dutifully done as it should have been. The Royal
Commission appointed to enquire into the Ballarat disturbances,
reported of that order that "previous experience should have
dictated rather a change of the law; a fire is kindling from the
use of some combustible material, and the official mode of
extinguishing the flames is to increase this material." No
condemnation by digger, journalist, or historian is stronger or
more direct than that, and it is to be remembered that the direct
author of "the official mode" was Sir Charles Hotham, and not
Colonial Secretary Foster, nor Chief Commissioner Wright, nor
Commissioner Rede, nor Acting-Chief Commissioner of Police
M'Mahon. But the diggers, as was natural, and, indeed, in a
sense, proper, regarded Foster as practically the source of
trouble. They had come from constitutional England, where the
Minister, and not the Crown, was responsible, and they had not
learnt that Sir Charles Hotham was both Crown and Minister in
one. They could not conceive that he who was less than the Queen
was more than the Queen, and that he was despotically breaking
the law&mdash;the law of official routine and of official
courtesy&mdash;and that, not for the public good, however
excellent the motive. They therefore threw on Foster, and
secondarily upon the gold-fields commissioners, the odium of a
policy for whose increased vigor the Governor alone was
responsible. Foster resigned office to placate the people and
ease the Governor's position, and it seems probable, by the
implied consent, if not desire of the Governor, not, as is easy
to infer, from a wish on the Governor's part to escape personal
responsibility, but as a concession to an irritated and
misjudging public opinion. It was only when before the Select
Committee of a Constitutional Parliament, thirteen years
afterwards, that Foster and the other officers of the Government
under Sir Charles Hotham&mdash;till then silent under the seal of
official duty and personal honor&mdash;revealed the fact that
they had all denounced the licence and the licence-hunting
policy, and that its maintenance and odious application were made
compulsory by the fact, as declared in evidence by Foster,
corroborated by the other witnesses, "that Sir Charles Hotham was
so self-willed that he was indisposed to take counsel."<br></p>

<br>
<p>But Sir Charles Hotham is more to be pitied than blamed, more
to be honored than condemned. There is no doubt that he died a
martyr to a high and chivalrous sense of duty. He was a victim of
error even before he reached his post in Victoria. The evidence
of Captain Kay, R.A., his private secretary, declares that</p>
<blockquote>Sir Charles Hotham disliked the licence fee; and I
know in Downing street he was told before he came here that in
consequence of what had already taken place in regard to this
licence fee, the question was not very likely to be settled
without a fight. He told me that more than once on board the ship
coming out; and in conversation together he formed his plan of
action in the event of such an emergency arising. I have often
heard him say he found the law imposing a licence fee in force by
Act of the Legislative Council when he came here, and it was his
duty to carry it cut&mdash;that he did not make the law, but that
he would use every means in his power to get it altered as soon
as he could.
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sir Charles Hotham was far too high-minded and honorable a man to
be able to make a scapegoat of anyone; he did not sacrifice Mr.
Fitzgerald&mdash;Mr. Fitzgerald sacrificed himself. Sir Charles
Hotham sacrificed himself also, but it was in the performance of
an onerous and thankless public duty, and he fell in the
discharge of it, as fully as any man ever did in the field of
battle.</blockquote>
<p>This is absolutely indisputable. It is borne out by the
evidence of Mr. Rusden, clerk of the Legislative Council, as is
also Captain Kay's opinion of the Governor's having abstained
from formally requesting Foster to resign. Sir Charles Hotham
arrived only at the end of June, 1854, hot from the stupid orders
of Downing street, himself a naval officer accustomed to command,
untrammelled by the restrictions of constitutional government,
and impelled by the instincts of his profession and his sense of
duty. He had little time, perhaps as little inclination, to
acquaint himself with the temper of the people, or to take
deliberate counsel with his officers in the Government, before
the troubles at the diggings had got beyond pacific solution. If
Foster ever gave advice, as is supposable, or if he did not
advise against the maintenance of the licence law, the Governor,
with the Downing street monitions ever about him, would naturally
go to his Attorney-General for counsel. Indeed, it is said that
Sir Charles did ask Mr. Stawell, now Sir William Stawell, the
Attorney General of 1854, what powers he had as Governor in
regard to the enforcing of the law, and that Mr. Stawell's advice
was that the Governor's powers were full and clear. There came
about, at any rate, a strong feeling at the time of the Stockade
and afterwards, that two martinets, a naval one and a forensic
one, had come together, and that the conjunction had boded ill
for the diggers. But, besides these digging troubles, anterior to
them in some sort, the Governor suffered irritation from what
seemed neglect and imposition in connection with his household
furnishings at Toorak, and he was also anxious because of a
decline in the revenue. Captain Kay says his own idea was "that
one-fourth of the money charged as expended upon Toorak never was
expended on the place at all." Such a belief was, no doubt,
shared by Sir Charles Hotham, and it is easy to conclude that the
result upon a man of ardent temperament and of high principles of
honor would be to dispose him to a want of confidence in the
officials whom he was bound to connect with the business. He
probably shrank proudly within himself, and Captain Kay says
before the Select Committee that the Governor "attempted to do
what no man alive could do, which was to take all the papers
connected with the Government of this colony and read them for
himself." "And did read for himself?" asks the committee. "And
did read for himself, and killed himself," is Captain Kay's
emphatic rejoinder. Mr. Rusden is equally convinced. "I think,"
he says, "he overworked himself, and being subject to internal
disorder for a period of years after he was on the coast of
Africa, no doubt the weakness to which he was reduced made him
fall a prey to the illness that had overtaken him: he worked very
hard, very often till one or two o'clock in the morning." There
is something pathetic in the whole picture of this misguided,
mistaking. Governor's martyrdom to duty. He fell a courageous and
devoted victim to duty and to political errors, as before him had
fallen the equally brave diggers and soldiers at the Eureka
Stockade.</p>
<p>Soon after the Stockade trouble was over, the officer in
charge held a parade of all the military force on the space now
covered by the gas works. It was a symbolic display of the
supremacy of law and, military though it was, of peace also, for
there had already come an earnest of the better things for which
most of the diggers had risen, pacifically or otherwise. It may
be mentioned here that the plate showing the march of the troops
to the Camp is historical&mdash;not imaginary. The artist, Mr.
Huyghue saw what he has depicted.</p>

<div class="dropcap"><img alt="" src=
"1304971h-images/Drop06.jpg"></div>
<div>H E acquittal of the State prisoners was an earnest of a
fuller fruition of the reform struggle. It was not merely an
acquittal of the insurgent diggers, but a justification of the
basis of the whole reform movement, and a condemnation of the
system of tyranny whose stupid and insulting administration had
provoked such bloody reprisals. The report of the Commission of
Enquiry averred that the diggers had been "governed three times
over", and declared that if the insurgents had been guilty of
excesses, they had been goaded thereto by bad laws badly
enforced. The remedy suggested was the Government of the people
by the people through a fairly representative Parliament. Thence
came our present Constitution and all its benefits in the form of
a manhood franchise; and local self-government.</div>
<br>
<p>Thus, to the wild delirium of the early gold-hunting time
there succeeded the troubles of the Eureka Stockade, and then,
with the gift of constitutional freedom, there came the noble or
ignoble rage of party politics. Ballarat has always held a
prominent position in politics. The sturdy men who fought through
all the agitations that led up to and followed the Eureka
Stockade seemed to have given a character of influence to the
electorates that were the outcome of those early struggles. But
some of those earlier fighters were soon left behind. The current
of politics ran a turbulent race in keeping with the swift march
of colonial affairs generally. Some men who rose to early fame
and bade fair to ride firmly upon the waters of public life have
drifted upon lee shores and made wreck of health and reputation.
Others have been out-faced by newer and bolder, if not better,
men, and have fallen back among the shadows of private life. The
simple aims and earnest honesty of most of the earlier agitators
have given place to complications of policy and, too often, to
the mere self-seeking of cunning men who trade upon the
weaknesses and the vices common to society everywhere, and
nowhere so potent as in a democracy where the passions and
prejudices of all classes have full play.</p>
<p>We may as briefly as possible trace the course of those later
events, besides glancing at some anterior passages of Colonial
history which were the prelude to those which relate more closely
to our story. On the 25th July, 1828, the British Parliament
passed an Act giving larger powers to the Governments of New
South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, and in 1837 the Government of
Australia was created. On the 5th August, 1850, the Government of
Victoria was constituted. One-third of the members of the
Legislative Council, the only House of Legislature then, to be
nominated by the Crown, and the other two-thirds by the
inhabitants of the territory, separation from New South Wales
taking place on the 1st July of the following year. The Victorian
"Act to Establish a Constitution in and for the Colony of
Victoria", was reserved on the 25th of March, 1851, for Royal
assent, was assented to on the 21st July, 1855, and was
proclaimed in Victoria, and came into operation on the 23rd
November, 1855. By that Act the old and partly nominee Council
was abolished and two Houses were created&mdash;a Legislative
Council and a Legislative Assembly, both wholly elective, the
Council having thirty members, chosen from six provinces, and the
Assembly sixty members, chosen from thirty-seven districts.
Pending the Royal assent to that Act, however, five
representatives from the gold-fields had been added to the old
Council. This was done in pursuance of a recommendation from the
Gold-fields Commission after the quickening time of the Eureka
Stockade, and Lalor and Humffray were chosen to represent
Ballarat. About the same time Messrs. Samuel Irwin, John Victor,
and William Bradshaw were appointed justices of the peace in
Ballarat. They were men of the times and of the mines, and their
appointment was one of the immediate fruits of the agitation for
reform of administrative as well as legislative abuses. Irwin has
already appeared in this narrative; Victor became principal of
Grenville College, Ballarat, but now lives in Sydney.</p>
<p>The first printed election addresses of Lalor and Humffray
were as different as the men. Lalor's was brief and plain as a
word of command from a military man. In his short address it was
natural he should say&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I am in favor of such a system of law reform as will
enable the poor man to obtain equal justice with the rich one,
which at present I believe to be impossible.</blockquote>
<p>Humffray's was more verbose and rhetorical, full of wise saws,
and bristling with sentiments and statistics.</p>
<blockquote>I respond (he said) to the call readily, because I am
anxious to enter St. Patrick's Hall, and have the high privilege
of joining in the patriotic chorus which will form at once the
requiem of the present irresponsible system, and be the herald of
a glorious future for Victoria.</blockquote>
<p>The printers of that day printed "golorious future", as if,
facetious in their work, they wished to qualify the pacific
agitator's eloquence by a suggestion of what, in the language of
American politicians, is called "high falutin". We, however, may
rather suppose he had only caught some distant echoes of the
songs of the bards of his native land as, in the ancient times,
they sang in "patriotic chorus" among the hills of long
unconquered and ever romantic Cymry. Born in Montgomeryshire,
near the source of the Severn, and not far from the head waters
of old Usk that runs from the Brecon hills by valley, and glen,
and crumbling castle walls, close past the site of hoary
Romano-British Caerleon, thence to mingle its waters with those
of the British Channel not very remote from the mouths of broader
Severn and the more picturesque Wye, Humffray may have seen
visions of the past and the future, in which poetry and politics
became curiously blended. Lalor was not so much given to visions
and poetry, if his later life be the test. He was directer, more
practical, more commercial. However, youth and hope are immortal,
and Humffray, at the time under discussion, was nearer than now
to the days of "unbounded hope and heavenly ignorance." He may
have penned his first political manifesto with the "March of the
Men of Haerlech" ringing in his ears, or under other remains of
the inspiration of his legendary forefathers who, if poets speak
truly, were, some of them, in youth, as "damsels-errant", and
used to</p>

Ride</div>
<div class="quote" style="margin-left:20%;">Arm'd as ye see, to
tilt against the knights<br>
There at Caerleon.</div>
<br>
<p>Humffray had spirit, and could assert himself in time of
pressure. On the 26th of March, 1862, a "monster meeting" was
held in the Town-hall, Ballarat East, to express indignation
against Humffray and John Cathie for their votes in favour of a
ten years' extension of the Squatters' Leases. Popular
indignation is often accompanied by imputations of corruption,
and by insulting assumption of almost despotic authority over the
very reason and will of the representative. A display of this
temper in the electorate seems to have occurred, for Humffray
retorts upon some scandals of the kind. He did not appear before
the meeting, but a letter from him was read in which were the
following passages in wholesome assertion of rational freedom in
the representative:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I wish it to be distinctly understood that I claim
now, as I ever have claimed, the most unfettered freedom in the
exercise of my judgment while recording my votes; as I would not,
for one hour, occupy the humiliating position of a mere delegate,
and vote according to order
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
As to the vile insinuations of corrupt motives which have been
made against me, I know, and am known in Ballarat East too well
to suppose for one moment that they will discredit any but their
authors. Thus much, however, I will say, that if the price of a
man's representing a constituency is that he must submit to an
inquisition, by public meetings, into the state of his private
affairs, whenever slanderous enemies choose to misrepresent and
stigmatise his votes as venal, no human being of any spirit will
consent to debase himself so far as to become a
member.</blockquote>
<p>Humffray fell, and Cathie too, before the storm; Cathie, who
was no mean stump orator, upon occasion, having had the the
courage to tell the tumultuous meeting that "the thing which
shows me I have done right is the noise and not the reason that
greets me." In all Humffray's public career he carried himself,
as Hamlet puts it, "indifferent honest", not descending to the
cunning arts of falsehood which have in later years carried away
many constituencies captive. Later, he went the way, though less
noisily, that the Netherlands Brederode went, and his influence
consequently declined.</p>
<p>When the first Parliament was elected under the new
Constitution Act, the Ballarat members were again elected, Lalor
for Grenville district, including Ballarat West, and Humffray for
North Grant, including Ballarat East.</p>
<p>There was one time, in December, 1856, when Lalor was held to
have belied his previous democratic action. A new Electoral Act,
brought in under the Constitution, the advent of which the Eureka
affair had done much to hasten, was before Parliament, and the
4th clause proposed a renewal of the property qualification for
the franchise. This was opposed by the country generally, as
manhood's suffrage was demanded as the people's right. It was
certainly a fair demand, and not illogical, as a sequence to the
principles declared by the gold-fields reformers when Lalor was
one of the most popular advocates of liberty. But Lalor voted for
the obnoxious clause in the Act, and brought a storm upon
himself. In a letter to the <i>Ballarat Star</i> on the 1st
January, 1857, he defended himself against the attacks of that
journal, and the complaints of his constituents. He
said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I would ask these gentlemen what they mean by the
term "democracy?" Do they mean Chartism, or Communism, or
Republicanism? If so, I never was, I am not now, nor do I ever
intend to be a democrat. But if a democrat means opposition to a
tyrannical press, a tyrannical people, or a tyrannical
government, then I have ever been, I am still, and I will ever
remain a democrat.</blockquote>
<p>Lalor held that "freehold suffrage is virtually manhood
suffrage," and on that ground he justified his vote. No doubt he
had grown more sober since the days in the latter half of 1854,
when a programme of principles not much unlike Chartism, and a
Declaration of Independence were adopted by the agitators of the
day. His defence shows that he had the courage of his opinions,
whether they were new or old, and suggests a feeling of the
necessity of some such correction of the unequal action of a
purely numerical majority, arrived at in the ordinary way, as
proposed by Hare in his scheme for the representation of
minorities. But he also went the length of advocating an Upper
House of nominees instead of elected representatives. He even
then cited that advocacy as a proof of his never having advocated
"thorough democracy". That such an opinion as to the Upper House
should have been held within twenty-four months of the Eureka
agitation by the armed leader of that rising is one more instance
of the mutability of human feeling if not of change of opinion.
Lalor may not have had any very well-reasoned opinions on
constructive politics when he took up arms against the rule of a
Government and a partially elective single House of Parliament,
but there is little ground for doubting that at that time his
sympathies were in favor of as wide a liberalism as was espoused
by those of his subsequent constituents who condemned his vote on
the 4th clause of the Electoral Act in December, 1856.</p>
<p>Though located in Melbourne then, Lalor did not cease to take
an interest in Ballarat affairs, and in letters written in July,
1857, he advises on divers municipal matters, and acutely
criticises a prospectus for a tramway projected to be run from
the Buninyong Road, or Plank Road&mdash;as that part of the road
from about Clayton street to near Buninyong was then
planked&mdash;to the forest near Beale's Swamp, to connect the
sawmills with the town. The plank road to Buninyong was begun in
1856, and was made because the road was not yet formed properly,
was swampy, and the traffic at that time was very great. A few
years after, to wit in 1862, a Ballarat, Smythesdale, Linton, and
Carngham Tramway Company was projected, with a capital of £10,000
in £10 shares; R.H. Lock, provisional secretary; but, like the
scheme Lalor criticised, it never came to fruition, though near a
quarter century was to pass before railway communication between
Ballarat and Smythesdale was established. Lalor displays business
shrewdness in that other matter, and is suspicious of undue local
journalistic influence. The <i>Star</i> was of baleful aspect to
his view, and he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>From what I have heard down here, I am satisfied that
all the gentlemen connected with the <i>Star</i> intend to rule
Ballarat, not only politically but commercially. Hence they have
put Belford into the Council, Finnis as Town Clerk, and Coote as
Surveyor. They have also attempted to get the Commission of the
Peace for Belford, as I am informed. All these exertions are
intended to produce pecuniary profit, as may be seen by the
printing contract for the Eastern Council, which is, I believe,
opposed to the standing orders. Now, it is quite evident they
wish to follow the same <i>game</i> with respect to the Treasury.
Hence Bailey and Coote are appointed.</blockquote>
<p>This sort of stuff would be amusing reading now, were it not a
reminder of the more unscrupulous attacks upon the journals of
to-day by scheming politicians whose garrulous effrontery is
surpassed by nothing unless by their insatiable and more than
womanly vanity, or by their unquenchable lust of power and place
and pay. As to Lalor, a dozen years from the Stockade episode
found him a much changed man as to his pursuits. The loss of an
arm and a cause had effectually reduced the revolutionary
hysteria of his earlier youth, and he declined upon less heroic
ambitions. He had failed to free this colony from the dominion of
the Saxon; but he could, at any rate, still tight for money and
political position, and in such a campaign discover talent as a
user of men, as one able to mine and countermine, and to push his
combinations with dogged tenacity even against odds. In 1854: he
was a mere working digger with transcendental political aims. In
1866 he had became a mining capitalist. As a shareholder in the
Grand Trunk Company, Creswick, he fought a long and successful
battle with others of the company, who, when the company
suspended operations because the mine had not paid, bought the
plant and sought to obtain a new title by lease from the Crown.
James Boughtman and Jonathan Middleton undertook the floating of
the new company; the old lease was forfeited for non-payment of
rent, the new lease was applied for, and in the meantime, or
before then, the projectors of the new company, called the
Australasian Company, had discovered rich ground. Then the issue
of the lease was opposed by a person who signed the protest as
"James Robinson". This person was never discovered. Nobody was
found who claimed to be the James Robinson in question, and no
proof of his existence or whereabouts was obtainable. He never
appeared, but Lalor was omnipresent as an obstacle, and the lease
was not issued until one Dominick Dillon, his friend and agent,
had 400 shares in the new company transferred to him free of
cost. The ground on which Lalor opposed the issue of the lease
was the assumption of fraudulent collusion on the part of some of
the projectors of the new company to the wronging of the old
shareholders in the Grand Trunk Company generally, and the
struggle over the lease application and its accessories led to
long and costly litigation. Lalor had the courage of his opinions
on the subject, and opposed Longmore's motion in the House "as an
attempt by one member to gratify his feelings, political or
religious, at the expense of another member, upon the mere
assertion of parties with whom he had been engaged for two years
in a legal struggle to gain his own." That struggle in the courts
was lively and long. Nor was that all. The parties had their
respective friends in Parliament, and on the 11th August, 1868,
Mr. Longmore moved&mdash;"That a Select Committee of nine members
of this House be appointed, by ballot, to enquire into and report
upon the circumstances under which certain persons, such as
Dominick Dillon and others, exercised a system of extortion over
applicants for mining leases and other privileges, which may be
dealt with by the departments, to procure bonuses and corrupt
advantages for the said extortioners and their accomplices, to
the injury of the public, in consideration of departmental and
parliamentary influences which they profess to exert; such
committee to have power to call for persons and papers; three to
form a quorum." This hot motion was inspired by a strong belief
that Lalor was using his position to extort advantages from the
innocents who were seeking the lease for the new company. But Mr.
M'Bain, by way of amendment, and in a more judicial spirit,
moved:&mdash;"That a Select Committee of nine members be
appointed to enquire into and report upon the circumstances
connected with a certain application for obtaining a mining lease
with which Dominick Dillon and others were connected; such
committee to consist of Mr. Wrixon, Mr. Sullivan, Mr. E. Cope,
Mr. Longmore, Mr. G.P. Smith, Mr. Aspinall, Mr. Macpherson, Mr.
Kerferd, and Mr. M'Bain; five to form a quorum, with power to
send for persons and papers." The original motion being
negatived, Mr. M'Kean submitted a further amendment, which was
almost word for word like Mr. Longmore's motion, but nominated
eleven members, namely, Messrs. Sullivan, M'Kean, Crews, E. Cope,
Miller, Blair, Kerferd, Thomas, Wrixon, Longmore, and Aspinall;
three to form a quorum. This was rejected, and Mr. M'Bain's
amendment was adopted. The committee began its sittings on the
25th August, and amongst the witnesses called were Messrs.
Frazer, Stutt, and C.E. Jones, members of the House, the last
named being then in office as Commissioner of Roads and Railways.
Lalor was also present, and at the close of the examinations was
informed that he could "make a statement" if he desired to do so.
He replied:&mdash;"If the committee desire to examine me upon
anything essential for me to say, I shall be very happy to
answer." Mr. M'Bain said:&mdash;"But you do not desire to say
anything unless the committee think proper to ask questions of
you?" and Lalor's reply was:&mdash;"I am not aware that anything
that any of the witnesses have said against me requires any
answer." And so "the honorable member withdrew" and added nothing
to the elucidations of the dark tangle of contradictions which
the committee had encountered in the course of the examination of
witnesses. The Select Committee had the spirit of Longmore's
motion, though toned down by M'Bain's amendment, as the motive
and cause of its existence. Its members comprised several trained
lawyers; its implied instruction was to find out if the issue of
the lease had been improperly <i>opposed</i>, and the finding was
that the <i>application</i> for the lease was not improper! This
was an impotent conclusion, doubtless, a kind of <i>non
sequitur</i> <a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href=
"#fn19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> that must have disgusted the
fiery Longmore, But it was not so bad as the first proposal, made
by Mr. Kerferd, for that included a perfect absolution of all
members of Parliament, so far, at least, as the words "nor is it
in evidence that any Member of this House is any way dishonorably
connected with it" went. Longmore could not brook so utter a
verdict as that, and he broke up the sitting by vacating the
chair. That was on the 8th September. On the 9th he was absent.
Mr. Aspinall was in the chair, and the report as cited above was
adopted and reported to the House. Previously to that, the
committee had decided "that the chairman be ordered to report
James Boughtman to the House for being guilty of gross
prevarication," and on the 1st September Mr. Longmore moved the
issue of the Speaker's warrant for Boughtman's arrest. After
debate, the motion was withdrawn, but was renewed on the 3rd
September, and carried, and on the 8th the Sergeant-at-Arms
informed the House that he had, "in pursuance of the order of the
House, arrested James Boughtman, and that he has him in his
custody." The prisoner had earned his fate by not telling a plain
unvarnished story, but his incarceration was not that of a felon.
Like Hugh George, the <i>Argus</i> manager, who was before that
put in parliamentary durance to suffer for the editor's attack
upon Premier M'Culloch, Boughtman had the range of the premises,
and fared sumptuously every day, but he had to pay the cost of
his entertainment. Parliament was prorogued on the 29th
September, and then Boughtman was set at liberty.</p>
<p>A perusal of the evidence taken before the Select Committee,
and of the multitudinous assertions and denials in the newspapers
of the day relative to the dispute, was not favorable to the
taking of optimistic views of the morality of the contending
gold-hunters. The emphatic verdict of many onlookers did not
refer to some of the witnesses who were disinterested, albeit to
the bulk of the disputants that verdict was applied
promptly&mdash;<i>arcades omnes</i>. <a name="FNanchor_20" id=
"FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#fn20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> But
none of these things moved Lalor. His courage was equal to his
caution, and that new-born faculty was parallel to his tenacity
of purpose. He forged his way onward, undeterred by hostile
criticism, and unseduced by the applause of laudators. He
retained his seat in each successive Parliament, was Commissioner
of Customs in the Berry Government, which was killed by the
general election of the 28th February, 1880; and when the Service
Government met with a similar fate by the general election of the
14th July following, Lalor was elected Speaker of the Legislative
Assembly on the motion of Mr. Berry. He had one violent opponent
only, namely, Mr. Bent, Commissioner of Public Works in the then
expiring Service Ministry. Bent, whose own reputation is in
<i>Hansard</i> and the public journals, said:&mdash;"As a native
of this colony, I am sorry to think that, to obtain the
distinction of being the Speaker of this House, it is absolutely
necessary that a man should be a rebel against the British Crown.
(Cries of "Shame" and "Disgrace".) I am quite sure the teetotal
members of this House will be gratified and very pleased to go
back to their constituents and say that they voted for a man who
was drunk on the floor of this House while Chairman of
Committees. ("Shame, shame"). I think it is a disgrace to this
country to elect Mr. Lalor as Speaker of this House, and I am one
who shall oppose his election." There was little expressed
sympathy with this fierce tirade, and even the speaker's chief,
Mr. Service, repudiated the coarse violence of his literally
surprising colleague. The Premier said:&mdash;"I rise to express
my extreme regret that my worthy and highly-esteemed colleague
has allowed his feelings on this occasion to obtain the better of
his judgment. I regret that he should have referred to a very old
passage in the life of the honorable member for Grant, a passage
which, I venture to say, reflects no disgrace upon the honorable
member." There may have been a slight strain of Pickwickian
humour in both addresses; but the Premier's condemnation of the
Bent attack was cheered by the House, and Lalor's election to the
Chair was unanimous. He discharged the high functions of the
office with conspicuous ability, creditably sustaining the
respectable traditions of the Chair during many sessions of
mingled storms and calms, and as the end of the first session of
the Parliament of the Gillies-Deakin coalition drew to its close
in 1886, the Speaker announced his desire to retire. He was
almost prostrated by diabetes, the physical energy of robuster
manhood was gone; and before the session ended, Lalor had to
absent himself from his place in the House.</p>
<p>In June or July, 1857, Messrs. John Yates, Alfred Arthur
O'Connor, and John Cathie were appointed delegates to represent
Ballarat in the Land Convention in Melbourne. The Convention was
called at the instance of the Victorian Land League, a body
sitting in the metropolis, and the immediate cause of the
Convention was the general opposition in the country to the Land
Bill then before the Legislative Assembly, and for his vote on
which Mr. Lalor was called to account by the electors of North
Grant. The first sitting of the Convention took place at Keeley's
Australasian Hotel, Melbourne, on the 15th July, Mr. Thos.
Loader, chairman of the League, presiding. When that series of
Convention sittings was over, a public meeting was held in the
Victoria Theatre, Ballarat East, to receive the delegates on
their return. Mr. Humffray presided, and he and the delegates
were received with great acclamations, Humffray's vote against
the Bill being contrasted with the contrary vote of Lalor, "the
recusant member for North Grant." About that time, too, a
pecuniary testimonial was being subscribed for Humffray, and
meetings were being held and requisitions signed to procure
Lalor's resignation, as he had been acting, to quote the
<i>Ballarat Star</i> of that day, "in the licence of constant and
unvarying opposition to the wishes of his constituents." The
feeling against the Land Bill was strong, and a petition signed
by 17,745 persons at Ballarat, and one from Sandhurst, signed by
11,875 persons, were sent to Parliament expressing the opposition
of the subscribers. In leaving this reference to the Land
Convention, it may be remarked that many of the delegates,
including Wilson Gray, who became the President, were afterwards
elected to seats in the Legislative Assembly.</p>
<p>The miners were long without a law to legalise and regulate
mining on private property, though as early as on the 4th March,
1857, Humffray moved, in the Legislative Assembly, "that the
petition presented from the miners and storekeepers of Ballarat,
praying for immediate legislation on the subject of mining on
private property, be printed." The records of Parliament inform
us that "the motion was agreed to." All the Parliaments for many
years after that were unmindful of the subject thus prayed for,
as the miners were too often content to feed upon the dry husks
of pleasant charlatanry and passionate party, instead of seeking
the pure and wholesome grain of honest and effectual
statesmanship. By so much, and only so much, can the Parliaments
be acquitted of neglect of the chief producing interest of the
colony.</p>
<p>The adage that a free people is governed as well as it
deserves to be governed has very few exceptions in illustration
of the rule. One great all-sufficing cause of the neglect of
mining interests in Parliament was the change that came in the
political constitution and in mining itself. That double change
placed power in the hands of the wages class, and converted
mining from a field of independent fortune-seeking for all alike
into a field for the exercise of capital and the employment on
wages of the class that held in their hands the balance of
political power. There thus arose the curious position that on
the gold-fields themselves mining questions came to be of
secondary political importance, as those who were most able to
suggest a mining policy were outnumbered by those who only, or
mainly, looked for wages, and who were led to vote for men who
supported any policy that seemed to promise abundant employment
and a wage-rate well maintained. The political agitations that
followed the introduction of manhood suffrage and its
accompaniments were therefore marked by all kinds of cries but
mining ones. Though the mines were still the backbone of the
country's prosperity, the men who worked in the mines on wages
were separated in sympathy from the capitalists, who were nearly
the whole exploiters of the mines; and theology, or protection,
or free-trade, or cheap lands, or some other hustings cry, or
some absorbing passion of party was generally the moving impulse
to the exclusion of questions relating to mining law and
administration. In the earlier days of the gold-fields men were
of one heart and soul, and on all public questions then current
there was an irresistible unanimity, for all were more nearly on
a level in industrial value and in relation to the chances of
fortune. The difference between the two times was natural, and
the Parliamentary results equally natural, for not even democracy
can prevent a war of classes, or make the greater to be always
the wiser number.<br></p>

<br>
<span class="u">"Golden Point" and the Ballarat Gold Washers,
1851</span></p>
<br>
<p>While, however, this change in the aspect of gold-fields
politics had taken place, there had also come with the diversion
of power some prevision of a still remoter change. The demand of
the majority for protection and cheap land disclosed an instinct
prescient of coming necessities. It was felt that though the
mines had been, and still were, the chief producing interest in
the colony, their importance had, relatively, declined. It was
further seen that this decline must inevitably continue, and that
for the increasing population new sources of labour and wealth
must be developed. Hence the cry for protection that local
manufactures might be created, and for cheap land that fresh
fields might be opened for the employment of labour and the
founding of new homes for the people.</p>
<p>That which the Protectionists desired the Free-traders also
desired&mdash;the creation of new industries. But, in the
differences upon the economical question, there arose so fierce a
fight of party that hurtful issues foreign to the original ones,
were raised as ancillary to victory rather than to the elevation
of public opinion or the consolidation of a pure and stable
scheme of economical politics. This made openings for new men,
banished old ones from the political arena, and, in conjunction
with the change that had come in the relations of capital and
labor at the mines, caused questions of purely mining
significance to occupy a subordinate and even neglected
position.</p>
<p>In the moribund nominee Council Mr. Haines was the last
Colonial Secretary as successor to the abused John Leslie
Fitzgerald Vesey Foster, or "Alphabetical Foster" as he was
sometimes designated from the multiplicity of names he bore. Mr.
Haines also formed the first Government under the New
Constitution of November, 1855. He was beaten on the 4th March,
1857, on a question of finance; Lalor and Humffray voting, as
they generally did, on opposite sides of the House. Lalor on that
occasion was with the defeated Government, and Humffray against
it.</p>
<p>There was one notable occasion on which Lalor and Humffray
voted together. This was in the old Legislative Council on the
10th January, 1856; a part of the proceedings relative to the
burial of Sir Charles Hotham being reported as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Mr. Fawkner moved that the sum of £1500 be
appropriated for funeral expenses, which were estimated to amount
to £500, and the remaining £1000 would amply suffice for the
erection of a monument. Mr. Lalor was quite willing to defray the
funeral expenses, but objected to the erection of a monument. The
memory of the thirty individuals who met their deaths at Ballarat
would be a standing monument to the memory of Sir Charles Hotham.
Mr. Grant moved an amendment that the vote be limited to £500,
funeral expenses only. He said the House ought to be just, and
remember those for whom no monument had been erected, and for
whose widows no sympathy was expressed. What could they inscribe
on his monument? Not his political character. Mr. Humffray
seconded the amendment.</blockquote>
<p>The amendment was lost, only the gold-fields members and one
or two more, eight in all, voting for it.</p>
<p>On the 11th March, 1857, a new Cabinet was declared, with Mr.
O'Shanassy as Chief Secretary, and Foster (whom Williamstown had
returned) was Treasurer in that Ministry, which hardly lived two
months. Its defeat was on personal grounds rather than on any
question of policy proposed. Lalor and Humffray still voted one
against the other on that occasion. Haines then came into power
again. This was in April, 1857, and he had with him Mr. M'Culloch
as Commissioner of Customs. That Ministry was defeated on the
22nd October, 1858, on a question of extension of the franchise;
Lalor and Humffray being still opposed to one another. On the
10th March O'Shanassy formed his second Government. This Ministry
was defeated on the 22nd October, 1859, on the ground of a
general want of confidence; Lalor voting against, and Humffray
for the Government. On the 26th October, the Nicholson
Administration was announced, with Wm. Nicholson Chief Secretary.
On the 21st November, 1860, that Ministry was displaced also on a
vote of general want of confidence; Lalor and Humffray still
preserving their relative positions. Lalor, however, had now
changed his constituency and sat for South Grant, which seat he
has held ever since; Humffray and Cathie sitting for Ballarat
East, and J.R. Bailey (who shortly afterwards was
Postmaster-General in the Nicholson Administration) and R.M.
Serjeant for Ballarat West. These changes were synchronous with
an alteration in the electoral districts, Grant and Grenville
being divided into several districts of which Ballarat East and
Ballarat West were two. In 1860 R. Gillespie and R.H. Locke were
elected for the district of Grenville, which included Buninyong
and the localities adjoining the Ballarat proper districts on the
south and west sides.</p>
<p>On the 29th November, 1860, the Heales Ministry was announced,
with Richard Heales Chief Secretary; and Humffray, Minister for
Mines. This Ministry was defeated on the 12th November, 1861, in
a debate on the Budget; and the next day a coalition Ministry was
announced, with O'Shanassy Chief Secretary. This coalition
Cabinet was displaced on 23rd June, 1863, on the Land policy,
both Lalor and Humffray voting with the defeated Government. In
the meantime Bailey and Serjeant had been displaced in Ballarat
West by Duncan Gillies and W.C. Smith. For Grenville A.A.
O'Connor was returned with Gillespie in 1862, and in 1863-4 he
sat with M.M. Pope, T. Randall succeeding O'Connor in 1865. W.
Frazer, once of the Ballarat Local Court, and J.T. Smith sat for
the Talbot district, in which Creswick and Clunes were
included.</p>
<p>On the 30th June, 1863, the first M'Culloch Administration was
formed, with J. M'Culloch Chief Secretary. On the 11th March,
1868, this Ministry tendered its resignation on the question of a
grant to Sir Charles Darling, who had been removed from office as
Governor of Victoria on the ground of indiscretions during
disputes between the Houses of Parliament over the Tariff. The
"Darling Grant Crisis" was a dispute between the opposing parties
as to a grant of £20,000 proposed to the recalled Governor. The
party opposing the grant came to be known in Victorian politics
as Constitutionalists, whilst the supporters of M'Culloch's
policy called themselves Loyal Liberals. While the dispute was
pending Sir Charles declined the grant, and so the battle ended.
After his death all parties here united in voting an annuity of
£1000 a year to his widow, and a sum of £5000 in trust for her
children.</p>
<p>While these events were transpiring electoral changes had come
about. In 1865, Charles Dyte and Charles Edwin Jones were
returned for Ballarat East. The former retained his seat, but in
1869 Jones was defeated by Humffray, who held his seat, though
Jones lodged an unprosecuted petition against his election. For
Talbot Frazer still sat also. His fame is in some of the least
creditable records in <i>Hansard</i> and the public journals. For
Ballarat West Gillies and W.C. Smith sat till 1865, when Smith
was replaced by W.M.K. Vale, who held the seat till 1869, when,
while Commissioner of Customs in the M'Culloch Ministry, he
resigned in order to contest the seat against Jones, the defeated
of Ballarat East. Jones had ousted Gillies, but, while Minister
of Railways and a colleague of Vale, he had been turned out of
Parliament on a charge of corrupt practices, both sides of the
House&mdash;his own colleagues in office as well as the
Opposition&mdash;voting for his expulsion. With great intrepidity
he declared his innocence, invoking God's name at a public
meeting in support of one particular averment of innocence, and
he boldly sought at the hands of the Ballarat West constituency a
rehabilitation of his tarnished reputation. Vale resigned his
seat to contest the election, as he declared, in the interests of
parliamentary purity, and he was beaten by Jones, who had a large
majority among the Welslhminers of Sebastopol. Vale had ceased to
be as popular as he had been, and the assistance he derived in
the contest from his old political opponents, no doubt raised
party feeling, and caused the election to be determined at least
as much from party spirit as from a regard to the greater issue
propounded to the electorate. What helped Jones's cause was, the
general belief that if he was guilty, others still unpunished
were as bad as he, and a suspicion in many minds that Vale's
contest was the result rather of envy or spite than of a sincere
regard for political honesty and purity of Parliament. Jones and
his accusers after that let the matter lie undisturbed. The
Assembly, as being unused to such great moral efforts, quietly
bore many taunts from without in relation to corruption, and
Jones was permitted to sit unmolested.</p>
<p>The M'Culloch Ministry having, as we have seen, resigned on
the Darling Grant dispute, a Ministry was announced on the 6th
May, with Mr. Sladen as Chief Secretary, Mr. Gillies being
Minister of Lands in this Administration. It was on the occasion
of Gillies seeking re-election on acceptance of office that Jones
had ousted him prior to his own expulsion from Parliament. The
Sladen Ministry was defeated on the 10th July, 1868, on a vote of
supplies, and Mr. M'Culloch then returned to power. This Ministry
was displaced in September, 1869, by a coalition of
Constitutionalists and Loyal Liberals on the ground of want of
confidence. A Government was then formed, with J.A. Macpherson
Chief Secretary. This Ministry was defeated on the Budget, and on
the 31st March, 1870, the Government resigned. Some of their own
supporters deserted them, including several Constitutionalists,
and after some time spent in negotiations by several members of
the House, and notably by Mr. John Macgregor, who had moved the
hostile motion on the Budget, Mr. (now Sir James) M'Culloch again
returned to power, and with him Mr. Macpherson, the deposed Chief
Secretary, who accepted office as Minister of Lands. The new
Attorney-General, Mr. Michie, was returned unopposed for Ballarat
West, taking the seat vacated by Mr. John James, who had been
elected to the seat vacated by Mr. Vale in his contest against
Jones. James, at a meeting in the Alfred Hall&mdash;when Michie
met the electors on his unopposed return&mdash;"took credit to
himself for having done a noble act. He had done something to
raise the Ballarat electorate&mdash;in fact, more than had been
done for years," in giving up political life in favour of his
more illustrious successor.</p>
<p>When Mr. Berry came into power for the first time as Premier
and Treasurer, on the 7th August, 1875, Mr. W.C. Smith accepted
office as Minister of Mines, and was returned unopposed on the
20th August. Mr. Berry was defeated on his land tax proposals,
and Sir James M'Culloch took office, with Joseph Jones as his
Minister of Railways; but on seeking re-election in Ballarat West
on the 6th November, 1875, Mr. Jones was beaten by Mr. Fincham,
Acting-Governor Chief Justice Stawell having refused Mr. Berry's
demand for a dissolution. Mr. Jones's defeat was helped by want
of faith in him as to his views on the secular education
question, and a monster Anti-Education Act meeting in St.
Patrick's Cathedral at that time increased the vigor of the
secularists, and helped to secure Mr. Fincham's victory. At the
general election on the 11th May, 1877, James Campbell contested
Ballarat West, but failed, the old members. Smith, Fincham, and
Bell, being returned. When W.C. Smith took office in the second
Berry Ministry as Minister of Mines and Education, he was again
returned unopposed, and a similar compliment was paid to him in
August, 1880, when he took office in the third Berry Cabinet as
Minister of Education. Mr. Smith, though no scrupulous Bayard,
never gave to faction what was meant for Ballarat, liberal as
were his contributions to mere party man&oelig;vres, for his
untiring devotion to local affairs made him the idol of his
constituency. When Mr. Berry went to England on the famous
embassy, Mr. Smith was Acting-Treasurer, and he distinguished
himself then by a speech in Ballarat, in which he declared that
he had initiated a policy of retrenchment, the capitalised value
of which would represent two millions sterling. His political
enemies took hold of the statement, twisted its probable
exaggerations into colossal masses of ridicule, and the "merry
millions of the Major" became a byword and a gibe. In 1883, when
the Service-Berry coalition Cabinet was formed, and Mr. Smith was
left out in the cold, he became a virulent opponent of his old
leader, and was hardly more scrupulous in his speech against Mr.
Berry than he had previously been on his behalf. The Major, since
become Colonel on the retired list, thus lost caste with some of
his old supporters, but he retained his hold as "a good friend to
Ballarat" upon his constituency generally, and has for a long
time been returned at the head of the poll. In February, 1883,
the electors were invited by Mr. C.E. Jones to renew their
political connection with him. He had dwelt for some years in the
United States for the benefit of his political health, and
returned to woo the suffrages of his old supporters again. In a
poll of seven candidates he and Fincham stood equal as in third
place, and the returning officer decided the tie in favour of
Fincham. At the general election in March, 1886, Jones was
returned second on the poll, R.T. Vale, brother of Jones's old
opponent, being third, and the old members, Fincham and Bell,
were left to the studious leisure of private life. To assist him
in paddling his political canoe, Mr. Jones started in Melbourne
the <i>People's Tribune</i>, a weekly paper, nearly the whole of
which was written by his tireless and versatile pen. In that
paper he posed as the people's friend by excellence, as the
champion of discontented civil servants, as the opponent of the
non-political railway and civil service boards, and as the
perpetually-pricking thorn in the flesh of the editor of the
<i>Argus</i>. With heroic hope, or equally intrepid scorn of
facts, the editor and proprietor of the <i>Tribune</i> assumed a
reversion of the adage that the darkest hour is before the dawn,
for the paper absolutely coruscated with brilliancy of promise
and assurance of imminent greater prosperity and influence the
week before it fell dead and joined the melancholy host of
abortive journalistic adventures. The hard-working editor was
thus left with larger leisure to pursue his custom of lecturing
on social and historical subjects, and to cultivate the field of
practical politics.</p>
<p>In Ballarat East, at the general election in March, 1871,
there were no fewer than eight candidates for the two seats
there, John James heading the poll, with Robert Walsh, barrister,
second. At the general election of April, 1874, there were five
candidates, and Daniel Brophy won first place, and James second.
At the general election of the 11th May, 1877, when Mr. Berry's
party polled well nearly everywhere, an anti-Berryite was
returned at the head of the poll in the person of Townsend
M'Dermott, barrister, James being second. At that election the
two old members, Humffray and Dyte contested the seats, as did
also Emmanuel Steinfeld, who took third place, Humffray being
fourth, and Dyte fifth. At the next general election, in
February, 1880, James recovered his old place at the head of the
poll, another Wesleyan local preacher, James Russell, winning
second place by 14 votes more than Brophy, who represented the
Catholic and Constitutional vote. Yet, Berry, the Liberal, was
beaten on the general result of the elections, and retired, but
returned to power in the following August, and retired in July,
1881, when the O'Loghlen Ministry was formed, and Brophy
recovered his place at the head of the poll, with James second.
At the next general election, in February, 1883, Russell was at
the top, and Brophy at the bottom, James, with monitions of the
future in the air, taking second place. In February, 1886,
another coalition ministry was formed, with Mr. Gillies as
Premier, Treasurer, and Minister of Railways, and Mr. Deakin as
Chief Secretary and Minister of Water Supply. Then Mr. James, who
had served the Liberals and himself and friends very faithfully
for years, and had held office for a long period as Chairman of
Committees, aspired to higher position, and accepted office as
Minister of Mines. That was the knell to his political life, at
least for the present. The coalition was not popular in his
electorate, and he still further intensified the opposition by
holding <i>quasi</i> ministerial functions for some time without
seeking the approval of his constituents in the usual way. So,
when the general election came, in March, 1886, he was rejected,
Russell heading the poll, and Mr. Edward Murphy, a Catholic, was
given to the Wesleyan local preacher as a colleague. James, who
had long since made friends of the mammon of agrarian
acquisition, in Gippsland, retired to the fertile acres he had
secured there.</p>
<p>Of the elections for the Legislative Council, it will suffice
to refer to those which have taken place since the creation of
the Wellington Province by the reform of the Constitution Act of
1881, the whole of Ballarat being included in that province. The
first election was on the 6th November, 1882, when James Campbell
was returned unopposed. The next was on the 10th April, 1883,
when he was again returned unopposed on his acceptance of office
as Postmaster-General in the Service-Berry Ministry. In August,
1881, the Hon. Henry Cuthbert retired by rotation, and was
returned by 2,535 votes to 2,126 polled by James Long. In
February, 1886, Mr. Cuthbert was returned unopposed on his
acceptance of office as Minister of Justice in the Gillies-Deakin
Ministry. In June, 1886, the Hon. J. Campbell having resigned
office, Mr. David Ham was elected in his stead by a large
majority over Thomas Drummond Wanliss, once proprietor of the
<i>Ballarat Star</i>. In August, 1886, the Hon. G.F. Belcher
retired by rotation, and Henry Gore was elected by 2,512 votes to
2,511 polled by Mr. Wanliss, who petitioned against Gore's
return, but Parliament being prorogued before the inquiry had
ended. Gore held his seat, and Wanliss was left to moralise on
the stupid old custom of trying such issues by parliamentary
committees, and to wonder whether his petition was dead or
alive.</p>
<p>One of the local episodes of 1886 was a movement in aid of
larger local self-government, and the decentralisation of
metropolitan and Executive functions and influence. It was headed
by James Oddie, and was but a spasm. The promoter engaged C.E.
Jones, M.L.A., as its advocate, and some other of the local
Parliamentary representatives mildly assisted at the first and
only public meeting in the Alfred Hall Assembly-room on the 30th
July, 1886. Four resolutions were submitted&mdash;the first in
praise of local self-government, the second advocating its
extension here, the third proposing an enabling bill to further
the union of local bodies, and the fourth urging the formation of
a Local Government Reform and Extension League. They were all
carried by acclamation, and were never heard of afterwards. One
morning paper praised the movement, the other one pooh-poohed it,
the public did not show any enthusiasm in the matter, and the
thing fell dead, though it contemplated the placing of the police
and all licence revenues and control under municipal direction.
In February, 1887, the Mayor of Ballarat East, Mr. Russell,
M.L.A., re-opened the decentralisation issue in a serio-comic
way, by drawing attention to what he regarded as the evil of
excursions of Ballarat people to the seaside, urging that such
indulgences took a great deal of money out of the place, and that
it should be counteracted by a big jubilee rotunda at the local
Botanic Gardens, and by other attractions. The <i>Star</i>
laughed at the complaint, and the <i>Age</i> gibed both at the
complaint and the cure; the latter journal, on the 28th of the
month, summing up its strictures in the following words which the
inhabitants of this city will do well to ponder over
thoughtfully:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Ballarat, with a population of 40,000, has three
separate municipalities without any bond of union. The
consolidation of this divided municipal power would do more to
enhance the importance and promote the interests of Ballarat than
all the Government favours likely to be conferred, and certainly
more than any futile effort to dictate to the citizens the manner
and place in which they shall spend their holidays.</blockquote>
<p>To revert to more exclusively local self-government, the
course of Local Court and Mining Board history may now be swiftly
traced. On the 14th of July, 1855, James Ryce, Robert Donald,
Carboni Raffaello, John Yates, William Greene, Edward Milligan,
John Wall, Thomas Chidlow, and Henry R. Nicholls were
chosen&mdash;at a meeting of the diggers near Lalor's stump, the
old try sting place during the previous year's agitation&mdash;to
serve in the Local Court granted under the reformed
<i>régime</i>. A day before this Mr. C.W. Sherard, the
resident-officer for the Government, had attempted to hold the
election from the top of a dray near the site of the late Charlie
Napier, but the crowd was too great for the space available, and
hence the resort to Bakery Hill, where the election was had by
show of hand. There was no other way practicable then, for the
times were primitive and the circumstances pressing. These courts
were the first fruits of the reform movement. They were presided
over by wardens of the gold-fields&mdash;the old commissioners
with a new name and smaller powers&mdash;and the members and
electors of the courts were men holding miner's-rights, documents
issued annually in lieu of the old licence. The Local Courts had
power, not only to make local regulations, but to sit as absolute
and unappealable courts of judicature upon cases brought under
the regulations they framed. This was a fatal error in
constitution, and in the course of time the defect became
generally apparent, and led eventually to the abolition of the
Local Courts and the creation of the Mining Boards as at present
existing. The first sitting of the first Ballarat Local Court was
on the 20th July, 1855, and the last sitting of the last court on
the 30th April, 1857, Mr. Warden Sherard being the first
chairman. To him soon succeeded Mr. Warden Daly, who filled the
office as long as the court existed. The first clerk to the court
was Mr. Bowker, who was followed by Mr. Harrington, and after him
came Mr. John Miskelly, who held the office till the courts were
abolished. Fresh parliamentary legislation in 1857 created the
Mining Boards and Courts of Mines, the Mining Boards having power
to elect their own chairmen, and being invested with merely
legislative and some trifling administrative functions. His Honor
Judge Rogers was the first judge appointed in the Ballarat Court
of Mines, presiding as well (after the death of Judge Wrixon)
over the County Courts and Courts of General Sessions for this
district. When the Berry Government perpetrated the "Black
Wednesday" outrage, discharged a host of judges, magistrates, and
other civil servants in order to kill the Constitutionalists and
promote the Berry version of Liberalism, Judge Rogers declined to
continue in the service. He was a most painstaking judge
throughout a long term of the heaviest equity suits ever brought
in this district. His high position at the bar has since then
been marked by the added rank of Queen's Counsel. With the
abolition of the Local Courts and the establishment of Courts of
Mines, there came also the Wardens' Courts, dealing with
applications for forfeited ground, and with mining disputes of
all kinds eventually, appeal in all cases lying to the Court of
Mines. The first Ballarat Mining Board was elected on the 27th
February, 1858, and Messrs. James Baker, John Yates, Alfred
Arthur O'Connor (for Ballarat Proper), William Frazer, Robert
Lamb (for Buninyong), Duncan Gillies, Robert Critchley (for
Smythesdale), Joseph Reed (for Creswick),&mdash;Martin (for
Blackwood), and William Butcher (for Steiglitz) were the members,
James Baker being chosen chairman. Mr. Harrie Wood was appointed
clerk, and he held the office until, in 1873, he received the
appointment he now holds as Under-Secretary for Mines in New
South Wales. His successor in the Mining Board was the present
secretary, Mr. J.M. Bickett, whose appointment was made on the
18th December, 1873. The first meeting of the board was on the
9th March, 1858. The Local Court members were remunerated by the
fees paid in the cases brought before the courts in their
judicial capacity. The Mining Boards receive each a Government
subsidy of £500 a-year, and the clerk is paid by the Government.
The courts were more intensely local bodies than are the boards.
The boards preside over and legislate for large districts, but
the courts had very small areas of jurisdiction, nearly every
mining centre, small or large, having its own court and its own
regulations.</p>
<p>In looking at the mixed powers of the Local Courts and their
great number, we see the cause of their abolition. The
conjunction of the legislative and judicial functions did not
work satisfactorily, and the multiplicity of courts being
followed by a multitude of varying regulations, another element
of dissatisfaction was found to quicken the desire for further
reform. Hence arose the Mining Boards and Courts of Mines, the
former legislating for districts in which previously, perchance,
half a score of Local Courts had exercised their anomalous union
of jurisdictions, and the later exercising judicial functions
over areas coterminous with the mining board districts. In the
present day the want of still further reform is felt. To the
Mining Boards is now raised an objection similar in part to that
raised against the Local Courts. As the larger views and wants of
the miners required the abolition of the Local Courts in order to
do away with vexatiously numerous and conflicting regulations,
and get rid of the inconvenient union of powers in the courts, so
now the abolition of the Mining Boards is held to be desirable as
a means of getting one uniform code of mining law for the whole
colony. Popular freedom is now perfect, and popular power so
absolute, that the form of local self-government existing in the
Mining Boards can no longer be regarded as essential to local
interests. On the contrary, the general feeling of the mining
communities all over the colony now is that the profitable
pursuit of mining will be best helped by a code that shall be
applicable to the whole colony, shall leave the pursuit as free
as possible from trammels of all kinds, and thus at once
facilitate the investment of capital, and give new fields to the
operative industry of the working miner.</p>
<p>But it must not be inferred from this that either the Local
Courts or the Mining Boards performed no services of value to the
gold-fields. Both have done much good. They were creations of the
times, and served the times faithfully. As experiments they
proved defective, but their work has been a part of our mining
progress, and will remain an honorable portion of colonial
history. The miners showed almost invariably a singular sagacity
in the selection of representatives in these local bodies, and
some of their earliest favorites have continued to hold positions
of credit and prominence up to the present day. Some 1600 cases
were adjudicated upon by the Ballarat Local Court during its
twenty months' existence. Many of these involved large sums of
money, and were complicated in their issues, yet few substantial
complaints were made against the decisions delivered by the raw
magistrates thus newly called by the will of the miners from
their ordinary and so different avocations. Besides its judicial
work, the court made laws, granted certain claims and
water-rights, and licensed "amalgamations", or unions of
companies. The court also, in its primitive sense of duty, fought
long with the lawyers, whom it tried ineffectually to exclude
from practising before the court. In this romantic attempt to do
without lawyers the whole court was unanimous, excepting Mr. H.R.
Nicholls, who dissented on the ground of illegality. Though
justified by the ultimate issue of the struggle, he had to bend
before the popular will of the hour, and so resigned his
seat.</p>
<p>Is it worth while to exhibit in the light of these modern days
the literal merits of this quaint antique question. On the 25th
September, 1855, Carboni Raffaello, on behalf of his colleagues,
sent a letter to the <i>Ballarat Star</i> with the following
enclosure:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Local Court, Ballarat, September 25, 1855.
Present&mdash;James Ryce, Edward Milligan, Robert Donald, John
Wall, William Green, Thomas Chidlow, H.R. Nicholls, Carboni
Raffaello. Proposed by Mr. Donald, and seconded by Mr.
Chidlow:&mdash;"That in all cases where attorneys or members of
the Legal professions are employed, either to advise or plead,
during the hearing of any case in this court, the court shall
have power to adjourn all such cases to any time, and from such
time to time as the members may see fit. Also, that this be made
public in the local papers in their first issue." The above
proposition was carried by a majority of eight. The following
protest was then handed in by Mr. H.R. Nicholls, the ninth member
of the court:&mdash;"I beg to enter my protest against this
resolution, inasmuch as the law officers of the Crown have
decided that this Court has no power to prevent solicitors so
advising their clients during the hearing of their case. The
course adopted by this Court in adjourning such case is, I
consider, unwise and unfair, inasmuch as it does not in any way
tend to settle the question, and is likely to cause much injury
both to the complainant and defendant in such
cases."</blockquote>
<p>As a pendant to this now amusing episode in Local Court life,
the following will serve to show that the same men could be
unanimous sometimes, could speak out with Spartan bravery, and
could, with a touching and egotistical earnestness, magnify their
office. The Court had passed a regulation extending the areas for
eight men "on the deep wet leads of this district" to twelve feet
square, and had sought the intervention of the Government to
sanction regulations to stop the "system of shepherding or
holding claims in reserve of 24 feet square by individual men,
boys, and often children! aye, and even women!!" The Government
did not respond and, on the same day that Raffaello wrote to the
<i>Ballarat Star</i>, the Court wrote an indignant letter to the
Colonial Secretary from which the above quotations, notes of
admiration and all, and the subjoined are copied:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>It is with feelings of regret and dying confidence in
the Government, that the members of the Local Court have observed
the indifference with which the Executive Government has treated
these and other matters of paramount interest to the miners. We
are alone the sinews of the entire colony, aye, even very life.
It is remarkable that attention could be given to the members of
the bar who wish to force their eloquence and learning upon us
for a fee I to capitalists owning engines among us, &amp;c.; and
not have sufficient time to say yes or no to the affair of the
Ballarat miners, inasmuch as the further consideration of the
Executive Government, or even of the Legislative body, on matters
upon which their knowledge must be second-hand, can throw no
further light upon the subject.</blockquote>
<p>Then followed a request for an expression of the "intention of
the Government with regard to the regulations submitted for their
consideration," and all the nine members signed the manifesto.
The document seems to have about it the odor of the old Bakery
Hill meetings. No mere "blatherskiting", that, as Raffaello would
have said. But then, those tribunes sat there, not more than nine
brief months away from the Eureka bloodshedding, and Raffaello
still less distant from the Melbourne goal and court of High
Treason. His blood at any rate had not cooled, and there was
still revolt in the general air at the least hint of adverse
action or inaction, for the Government and the Parliament had not
yet been popularised. There was yet much to do before there was
full freedom and perfect self-government.</p>
<p>Raffaello was lithe and irrepressible as Puck or Ariel. One
day, the 8th October, 1855, he objected to the presence of a Mr.
Watson, clerk of the bench of magistrates, who was sitting inside
the rail, or barrier, which divided the public from the members,
parties, reporters, and lawyers. Raffaello asked the Chairman,
the merry, brown eyed, handsome young Warden Daley, to order
Watson's removal. The Chairman declined, and said he had no power
to exclude anybody who conducted himself with proper decorum.
Every one of the members of the court sided with the peppery
little Roman, and left the court. Watson had about him the aroma
of the recently-suppressed tyranny, and was evidently offensive
to the jealous tribunes of the people. The Chairman adjourned the
court, regretting "that the very men who had been elected by the
diggers to forward their interests should be the foremost to
impede them." Idle words, these, to men red-hot with passion.
Next day Raffaello returned to the subject, tabled a motion,
seconded by Robert M'Donald, excluding from the inner area of the
court all but parties and reporters. The Chairman directed that
the motion be made a record of the the court, but reserved to
himself discretion as to its enforcement. Within forty-eight
hours Raffaello was in the thick of another fight. This time his
enemy was a lawyer, and the battle-field the columns of the
<i>Star</i>. "An Advocate" had written taking the Local Court
members to task for objecting to lawyers practising, and for
pocketing so many court fees. Our little Ariel flew up at once
with a letter on the 11th October, headed</p>
<div class="quote" style="margin-left:30%;">"<i>Principiis
obsta;</i></div>
<div class="quote" style="margin-left:20%;"><i>Sero medicina
paratur,<br>
Cum mala per longa invaluere moras</i>." <a name="FNanchor_21"
id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#fn21" class=
"fnanchor">[21]</a></div>
<p>He, at any rate, was not going to run any risks by long
delays. The court got no more out of the fees than it had a right
to, and "if Mr. Lawyer, 'An Advocate', is fond of declamation, a
descendant of the Gracchi is just now getting better and better
in health, and will give him a good feed, all hot, of the old
style:&mdash;<i>Quousque tandem abutere Catilina patientia
nostra</i>." <a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href=
"#fn22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Perhaps "An Advocate" thought
he had not encountered much patience to abuse in the red-haired
valiant little son of the Gracchi, and after a little while the
storm blew over, Ariel did his best to fold his wings and keep
quiet, and the lawyers having won their battle, pocketted many
fees by way of first fruits of a heavier harvest yet to come.</p>
<p>The members had a few other smart tussles with the wardens and
the Government, battling like real tribunes of the people; now
for a rain-proof house to sit in, and smooth forms to sit upon;
now telling a resident-warden to mind his own business; and now
calling on the Government to look after the court chairman, or
the governor of the gaol. Indeed, it is not too much to affirm,
that if the Parliament of the colony had been&mdash;in relation
to the gold-fields&mdash;composed of men as honest in intention
and as earnest in endeavor as have been the Local Courts and
Mining Boards, the main industry of the country would not have so
long suffered from the want of suitable laws. It is probable that
the scandalous neglect by the Government and the Parliament was
also owing, in some degree, to the sense of limited
responsibility caused by the existence of local boards of
legislature; and in this view it may fairly be said that the
existing Mining Boards can in no way so well serve the mining
interest as by securing their own abolition in assisting the
central authorities to prepare one code of mining law for all
Victoria.</p>
<p>The Mining Statute of 1865 created a new court, called "The
Court of the Chief Judge of Courts of Mines", to be presided over
by a judge of the Supreme Court. In its appellate jurisdiction
the orders of the court were final. Besides appellate and
original jurisdiction, special cases were reserved for the judge
by the inferior courts. Mr. Justice Molesworth was appointed
Chief Judge, and he held the office until his retirement from the
bench.</p>

<div class="dropcap"><img alt="" src=
"1304971h-images/Drop07.jpg"></div>
<div>H E course of local legislation has been the sign of
progress in mining, and all other local development has been
involved in the prosperity of our chief industry. Two kinds of
claims have for some years been in existence, one called "block"
and the other "frontage" claims. The block claim is a fixed area,
with bounds ascertained from the first; the frontage is a claim
with a given width on a lead, or gutter, with boundaries
changeable as to direction according to the course of the lead.
In California and at Golden Point in 1851, the system of parallel
claims, with frontages to water for washing purposes, was in
vogue, and hence the application of the term frontage to the deep
workings in Ballarat at a later date.</div>
<br>
<p>Here, before going on with the story of development, may be
mentioned a discovery made by the author since the first chapters
of this new edition were printed. The story of the Golden
Pointers has been told already, but a week before they reached
the Point, a party of three from Geelong&mdash;John Smith, Joseph
Asplin, and the late "Old Harry", of the North Grant livery
stables&mdash;had left Hiscocks and followed the Yarrowee round
to the Black Hill, passing by the rich Golden Point that was to
be, to pitch their tents at the foot of the Black Hill. They
began to dig at once at Devil's Point, but got very little gold,
and by October their rations were exhausted, and they returned to
Geelong and brought up their wives and a replenished
commissariat. By that time there was no room for them at Golden
Point, and they prospected about the Black Hill, getting gold
from the quartz outcrop on the top and in some alluvial patches,
but nothing heavy. Meanwhile came news of the Fryer's Creek rush,
and nearly all the diggers at Ballarat rushed away to the new
Pandora's box, the Black Hill trio following suit on New Year's
Day, 1852. They did well at the rush, but eventually returned to
Ballarat. "Old Harry" is dead, Asplin is settled elsewhere, and
Smith, now 73 years old, who was burnt out a year or so ago, is
now living on his old home site in a new house. He is a by no
means rich man, but one who still leads an industrious life as
the tiller of his own well-stocked terraced garden on the eastern
slope of Seymour Crescent, whence he can look out upon the
adjacent hill where his first tent was pitched and his first gold
won, thirty-six years now gone. Close upon Smith and party's
heels came others, amongst whom was William Bradford, who is
still here, a hale old pioneer of 76 years, father of
cycle-seller Bradford, who for many years has been busy in mining
affairs, notably as legal manager of claims at Gordon, where his
name is given to the Jones-Bradford Company.</p>
<p>There has been in many of the old diggers a strong development
of what the phrenologists call "inhabitiveness". Like Smith and
Bradford, they would cling with tenacity to the spots where they
pitched their tents at first, let the currents of business, of
settlement, or of mining drift as they may A similar doggedness
of "inhabitive" pertinacity has often been shown by the old
wifeless hatter, or lonely gold-hunter. The author has in his
recollection one of that sort of invincible plodders with the
lone hand. He bore one of the most ancient and most illustrious
of English names, had been a Major in General Scott's corps
during the Mexican war, and had then come to the Australian
diggings. Year after year he followed the digger's vocation, at
first in parties of other diggers, at last as the lonely hatter,
was never successful, and never gave up hope. Grey hairs and deep
furrows came with the long succession of luckless years, but his
grey-blue eyes were still clear, and he still pursued his hobby
of gold-hunting in the ranges, where he felt certain he would
some day "come on it heavy". Alas, the years were heavy, but the
gold light, and but for the kindly subsidies of old chums who
were better off, the gallant old Major would not have been able
to pursue the resultless battle so long as he has done; for, at
the time of this writing, he is still carrying on the bootless
quest.</p>
<p>Up to the year 1856 the block claim system had been
exclusively the rule here. The original area of eight by eight
feet per man, established by the Latrobe Government, was enlarged
as the sinking increased in depth and the miners obtained the
power to make their own regulations. But so long as the areas
were small and fixed there was a great waste of labor, time, and
money, as, out of a group of many claims, only a few could be put
upon the gutter, or auriferous alluvium. In the first days of
gutter-sinking, too, the miners sank only for the gutter, the
value of the reefs, as the banks of the gutters were called, not
having been at that time ascertained. This led to the abandonment
of shafts and ground the moment the gutter itself was known to be
outside such ground, and to the practice of "shepherding", or
holding claims unworked pending the proving of the gutter course
by the workings in more advanced claims. When, however, the
ancient river-beds had been traced by the miner from their
shallow sources into greater depths beneath the surface, the
sinking of shafts became a more serious and more expensive
business, and the waste accompanying chance-sinking became
obvious so long as the areas remained too small to ensure the
presence of the gutter. At length arose an agitation by some of
the miners for the abolition of block claims on deep leads, and
the adoption of the system of frontage or parallel areas,
ensuring a given length of gutter to each claim. The proposal was
warmly contested, and led to breaches of the peace and more
general disturbance than had occurred since the affair of the
Eureka Stockade. Mr. John Finlay first suggested the adoption of
the frontage system in 1855 in letters to the <i>Ballarat
Star</i>, under the signature of "Peeping Tom". Mr. Bacon, who
was then in partnership with Mr. James Baker at Sebastopol, soon
gave the proposition a more substantial form, and after that Mr.
Baker espoused the cause so heartily, and fought for it so ably
and so persistently in print and on platform, that he made the
project peculiarly his own, and for a long time the frontage
regulations were known as the Bakerian regulations. As already
stated, the new scheme was opposed. The Sebastopol miners, who
had to sink through rock to get to the gutter, felt the need of
the protection from risk which the frontages promised, but the
miners on the shallower and richer grounds of the older portion
of Ballarat retained their liking for the old block system. The
Local Court itself was divided upon the question, and resolved to
refer the decision to the miners as an election issue. Bands of
music, flags, and processions were a part of the outward and
visible signs of commotion evoked by the issue raised. After
preliminary election struggles, the members of the court resigned
to test the question by a general ballot of the miners. A
hustings was erected near the present site of the Ballarat gas
works, and the result was a decisive victory for the frontage
advocates. This was on the 14th July, 1856. The triumphant party
raised a shout of victory as they moved off up the then open
slope on the eastern side of Lydiard street, and the miners in
the minority showed their sense of defeat by chasing their
opponents up the slope and hurling blows and missiles in all
directions. A riot seemed imminent, but mounted troopers rode up,
dispersed the mob, and patrolled the streets to maintain the
peace.</p>
<p>Since then the depth of mining has increased, and with it the
areas of claims, while unforseen complications of titles arose as
different gutters were discovered and frontage boundaries
intersected each other. This led to a great deal of litigation,
and as the original argument for frontage claims had lost its
force when the extended areas ensured to each claim a portion of
the gutter, there gradually arose a demand for the abolition of
frontage and a return to blocks. This cycle was run in the course
of one decade, and now all our deep lead mining companies have,
wherever possible, converted their holdings into blocks, held, in
many instances, by leases from the Crown, or by consolidated
miner's-rights, the price of the ordinary right having been
reduced from twenty to five shillings a-year.</p>
<p>The first proposals to largely extend the areas for mining
claims were violently opposed, but events have justified the
foresight of the advocates of extended areas, as immensely
increased difficulties have made large outlay of capital
necessary, and larger areas equally indispensable.</p>
<p>The areas tenable as mining claims under the bylaws of the
Mining Board are limited by the bylaws, but areas held under
lease are limited only by the terms of each lease. The latest
bylaw of the Ballarat Mining Board limits a quartz claim area to
750 feet in width, with a length of 100 feet to each man.
Alluvial claim areas are determined by the depth from the surface
to the bed rock on which lies the golden drift or gutter. The
latest bylaw ordains that a claim for one person shall be an area
not exceeding half an acre, where the depth does not exceed 50
feet; over 50 and not over 100 feet, one acre; over 100 and not
over 150 feet, two acres; over 150 and not over 200 feet, five
acres; over 200 and not over 300 feet, nine acres; 300 to 400
feet, thirteen acres; over 400 feet, twenty acres. Unregistered
claims may be occupied, one man having a right to 10,000
superficial feet in alluvial ground, and in quartz 50 feet along
the lode by a width of 250 feet.</p>
<p>As was seen in the previous chapter, the Local Court had to
take the Government to task for its inattention to some rules
proposed in the matter of shepherding. There was cause for the
Local Court interposing in the matter. On the 27th December,
1855, the <i>Ballarat Star</i> declared "we are not above the
mark when we estimate the shepherds at 4000 or 5000 men, or about
one-fourth of the population." But there was no frontage system
then, nor areas large enough to warrant sinking on the areas then
in vogue on the rock leads until the course of the gutter was
known. Hence the dilemma. The miners had just traced the
Frenchman's Lead beneath the Sebastopol plateau with its
superincumbent deposits of clay and basalt. On the 26th December
they held a meeting, and a proposal by Mr. Bacon, "that parties
of twelve should have 34 feet allowed them along the supposed
lead," was rejected in favor, not of a demand for larger areas,
but of a petition to the Local Court "to propound rules which
shall permit shepherding on this difficult lead, and obviate the
deplorable consequences of jumping, riot, and tumult."</p>
<p>While all these legislative changes were going on, the
character of mining operations underwent remarkable mutation.
Excepting in old shallow grounds where the "hatter", as the
single worker was called, or the small party of co-operative
miners worked, the tub and cradle and windlass, those signs of
early digging days, had disappeared. The alluvial gutters that
had been found within the Ballarat East basin and on its sides,
as well as those afterwards discovered on the western slopes, as
White Horse, Frenchman's, Terrible, and Cobblers, had, by the
year 1857, been traced beneath the basaltic deposits of the
western plateau. Instead of having to sink through from 100 feet
to 180 feet of diluvial clays and drifts merely, the miners now
had to go in some cases more than double the greater depth, to
blast through successive layers of dense basaltic rock, and to
encounter heavy flows of water in the rocks and drifts. The
Inkermann, Redan, and some tributaries still later discovered,
belonged to the same category of rock mining, and involved
similar difficulties and hazards.</p>
<p>The following table shows, approximately, the order of
discovery after the year 1854. Before the dates given as to the
leads mentioned there had been workings in the shallower
portions, but the dates refer to the discovery of well-defined
gutters or leads in the deeper ground:&mdash;</p>

<p>During the ten years after the Stockade year, a good deal of
auriferous ground was opened down the valley of the Leigh as far
as the Durham Lead. The Scotchman's, Black Lead, Stone Quarry,
Sodawater, Devonshire, Goldseekers, Franklin, Victoria, and
Welshman's Leads were during that time opened, as also the Union
Jack and others at Buninyong. Well-defined leads in the
Smythesdale, Scarsdale, Linton, Haddon, and some other fields in
that part of the district were also discovered. Some of these
last named, and Creswick likewise, have, with varying fortunes,
continued to yield gold from deep gutters up to the present
time.</p>
<p>Looking back at the earlier stages of practical mining, we see
that, no longer able to carry on his vocation by mere manual
labor and simple co-operative organisation, the miner had to
invite the co-operation of capital and to employ expensive steam
machinery. On the Eureka the first engine was worked on 3rd
October, 1855, and before that date isolated attempts to use
steam power had been made at the Canadian, Red Hill, and Red
Streak, Peter Matthews at the Red Hill being the first to set up
pumping and puddling gear, and on a principle pretty closely
adhered to from that day to the present time. For a long time the
miners opposed the introduction of machinery and capital. Mr.
Wood tells us, in his notes published in Mr. Brough Smyth's
"Gold-fields of Victoria", that when Messrs. Talbot and others
put up an engine near the spot now intersected by Bridge and Peel
streets, to work a shaft on the Gravel Pits Flat there, "a body
of men proceeded to the claim for the purpose of smashing the
engine, but were prevented from doing so by Mr. Talbot, who had
provided himself with fire-arms, and threatened to shoot the
first man who approached." Some few years after this, namely, in
March, 1859, engines and horses were introduced below the
surface. The Burra Burra Company erected a four-horse power
engine below for hauling, and it was reported at that time that
thirty pounds weight of gold were taken from the excavation made
for the erection of the engine&mdash;an area of thirty feet by
seven. At the same date a Welsh Company in Paddy's Gully,
Winter's Flat, used horses below ground. Since then both engines
and horses have been used in several of the larger mines.</p>
<p>So long as the grounds worked were shallow and rich the
opposition to machinery was in some sort tenable, but as soon as
gold-seeking assumed the features already described as belonging
to rock-lead mining, the use of capital and machinery became a
necessity. The eight feet square claim, bottomed at from two to
twelve feet, and exhausted in as many hours sometimes, when
Governor Latrobe first saw the gold hunters of Golden Point in
1851, has been followed by areas of hundreds of acres, held by
hundreds of shareholders in incorporated companies, a single
claim often worked by several large deep shafts, at each of which
is an extensive plant of steam machinery, with the best possible
shaft apparatus, the mine traversed by a network of tunnels and
tramways, and taking many years to exhaust even approximately of
its auriferous deposits. The tub, cradle, tom, whip, and whim are
out of date and inapplicable to the claims now held by our large
rock-lead companies, save only that the windlass or the whim is
still sometimes used in initial operations. Many thousands of
pounds sterling are spent in the mines of to-day before gold is
ever reached by the miner. The United Hand-in-Hand and Band of
Hope Company was said, by deputations before the Government, to
have expended over £300,000 without having paid a dividend. Whole
forests have been felled to supply firewood to our steam engines,
and timber for the mines below. Our companies call for tons of
candles at a time, and in some instances have gas to light up the
dark recesses of their mines To draw the trucks of ore along the
extensive iron roads in their mines they have studs of horses
snugly housed in the warm bowels of the earth. Engineers,
engine-drivers, clerical managers, clerks, mine managers,
captains of shifts, troops of miners, boards of directors, all
belong to the working staff of our mines of to-day. The surface
works at a single shaft involve an outlay of thousands of pounds
in some instances, where there are engines, boilers, tramways on
the ground, tramways in the air, lofty poppet-heads, with braces
supported by ponderous beams and uprights, and housing to shelter
all the costly portions of the plant. In the sinking of a single
shaft many thousands of pounds are sometimes expended. The outlay
is similar in many instances, whether the mine be a quartz or
alluvial one, and in several of our mines, as notably in the
Prince of Wales mine, Sebastopol, both quartz and alluvium were
worked, the steam-driven iron batteries working simultaneously
with the steam-driven iron puddlers in extracting the gold from
the original matrix and the alluvium respectively.<br></p>

<br>
<p>Of the luck of gold digging the history of the early years was
full. A few instances of the early fifties are all we have room
for here. John Hosking and party, eight in all, had taken up
ground on the Red Streak, near Poverty Point, and, after
shepherding several shafts awhile, left the ground, as the gutter
appeared to be in a different direction. The party were strolling
down the Main road one day, and Hosking, who still had some faith
in the claim, proposed to Frank Kneebone, one of his mates, that
they should toss up to decide whether or not they should go back
and work the claim. A half-crown was thrown and Hosking won the
toss. To work they went, and in nine weeks took out 192 lbs. some
odd ounces of gold. This was from part only of a 24 feet square
claim, for the party left the reef unworked, and a second party,
who bought the claim after Hosking's crowd had done, took out
near £500 a man. As was the custom in those days, Hosking's party
threw away the headings, or top part of the wash dirt, until they
found that Chinese were washing it greedily. Testing it they
discovered that it paid well, and after that they washed all the
dirt. Hosking and his son went home with £3,300 after a sojourn
in Ballarat of only a year and nine months in all. It appears
that the Indicator strike of gold passes through the claim on the
Red Streak whence Hosking and his mates took so much of the
precious metal, and that helps to explain its richness. Wood's
"Notes" tell us that one party of six obtained 112 lb. of gold in
ten weeks. Belcher and party of eight made £3000 each in four
months. Eight Frenchmen obtained £2500 each in five months. The
"Hell Fling Mob" obtained a similar amount each, and the
"Sanctified Mob" £1500 each. These are only specimens. The
working of the Eureka, Red Hill, and Canadian gutters, with their
"Jewellers' Shops", their nuggets, their rich "pockets", their
reefs or gutter-banks, often as rich as the gutters, supplied
many instances of large individual successes. Now we go on with
the development of mining.</p>
<p>Some documentary evidence before the author as he writes
illustrates the development of operative mining partnership, from
the Golden Point days of a few select friends working together to
the modern times of large incorporated companies, as also the big
equity suits which were a part of the modern phase of mining. The
first mining agreement extant is dated 22nd September, 1851, is
brief, plain, pithy, and signed by James Scott, John Armstrong,
George Maynard, William Blaikie, Henry Duncan, and Thomas Butler,
a party from Geelong. There is nothing specially notable in it,
but clause 2 provides "that we do agree to abstain from digging
or searching for gold on the Sabbath day" and clause 4 "that any
person being found intoxicated shall forfeit the sum of £5, and
for the second offence shall be expelled, should a majority of
the party request it, and shall accept of such terms as the
remaining portion of the party may deem just and equitable." One
of the party&mdash;presumed to be Duncan&mdash;gave place to
Alexander Fyffe, who filled a public space afterwards in Geelong
life. The provisions as to Sunday work and temperance show how at
the very start of the gold-fields there were men who had in them
the religious sense and common sense, qualities which have been
as saving salt in all the after years of change, toil, trouble,
and turbulence. The next agreement bears date 8th October, 1851,
and is signed by H.T. Bond, Alfred Higgins, James Curtis, Jno.
Francis, Alfred John Windley, Wm. Morrison, Alfred Scott, James
Watt, all of Geelong and neighborhood. It is a much more
elaborate paper than the first one, and has a smack of legal lore
in the wording, though nearly all the subscribers were printers.
It bound the subscribers "for two calendar months from the date
hereof for the purpose of digging or procuring gold or other
mineral at Ballarat or at such other place as may be determined
only a majority of the members of the Association." The rules
were precise for the maintenance of sobriety and integrity, and
for the due deposit and division of gold, the treasurer being W.
Morrison, a relative of ex-mayor A.T. Morrison, of Ballarat City.
The John Francis of the signatories became proprietor of the
<i>Creswick Advertiser</i>, and was one day found dead in a water
hole at Sulky gully where he had apparently fallen on his way
home at night. The James Curtis has been for years in business,
as printer and stationer, in Armstrong street.</p>
<p>The next document is a printed half sheet of foolscap
containing the Albion Co.'s rules, introducing us, still under
the cooperative system, to the half shareman who by that time had
come to be common in deep sinking work, where capital was
necessary and was represented by the "sleeping" half shareholder,
or by the "furnisher" who supplied materials of some kind, and
had a sleeping interest in the "mine", as the earlier "claim" had
come to be called. It is a "Memorandum of Agreement, Rules, and
Regulations, made and entered into this twenty-seventh day of
February, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven between the
undermentioned miners, being the shareholders working the claims
numbered 115 to 123 (surveyed under class F of the regulations
Gazetted 9th January 1857) on the Frenchman's Lead, Sebastopol
Hill, in the District of Ballarat." The rules create a board of
nine, to conduct the company's affairs, one of the nine to be
chosen by the company as manager to "carry into effect all rules
and decisions of the board." A secretary was to be similarly
chosen from the nine who were to audit his books every Saturday
and see that a "monthly balance sheet shall be posted up in the
Albion Lodge for the inspection of the shareholders." Then came
rules for registration of shares, half shares, and so on, for
fines for breaches of rules, for payment of 100 per cent. per an.
on unpaid fines, and 50 per cent. per an. on wages paid on
account of an absent shareholder. Only necessary work to be done
on Sundays, and "no fossicking unless by the sanction of three or
more of the Board." Excellent provisions were made for order, for
safety in working and for a world of necessary details, and
further, "this company shall engage two or three beds in the
Ballarat Hospital for the benefit of sick or otherwise disabled
shareholders."</p>
<p>Our next and last specimen is a big bundle of twenty-one
parchment folios, with an aggregate area of twenty-one feet by
one and-a-half. This portentous heap is in orthodox legal form,
illuminated with red ink lines, seals nearly as "big as muffins",
to quote the words once used by barrister (now judge) Cope, when
appearing in a Local Court case a few years before the creation
of these "Articles of Agreement made and entered into this twenty
fifth day of March, One thousand eight hundred and sixty four"
between Frederick William Tatham, as legal manager, and the
Prince of Wales Co., on the Cobblers Lead, Sebastopol. This
bundle of very expensive parchment brings us into the epoch of
mining scrip, mining disputes, lawyers, litigation, and heavy
bills of costs. It is, itself, a monument of litigation, for it
is initialed here and there as an exhibit by the clerk of the
Court of Mines at the several dates when the unhappy company had
to appear and be duly shorn by the shearers. It provides, with
the tedious tautology so dear to lawyers, for the constitution of
the board and all its functions, and all the rights and
liabilities of the shareholders. There are schedules, and forms
of transfer and acceptance of scrip, showing that the company was
registered as the Prince of Wales Company (Limited), under 24
Victoria, No. 109 (Pyke's Act), in 2560 shares of £50 each. Three
or four superficial feet of the parchment are covered with the
names and seals of the shareholders; broad margins with notes and
numbers guide the eye, and red lines bound the whole as if
blushing at the enormous expenditure of words and costs. Then
follow on "further agreements" in German and other text, bearing
date 9th January, 1865, and setting forth that the company is
re-formed as the Prince of Wales Company, Registered, with a
capital of £128,000, in 5170 shares of £75 each, £22 10s. per
share paid up. More superficial feet than before are now covered
with signatures, seals, schedules and other painful details.
These folios recite a schedule, showing the company's property
representing the paid up capital, namely:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Frontage claim, Cobblers Lead, 4228 feet for 64 men.
Frontage claim, Golden Point Lead, 2795 feet for 75 men. Frontage
claim, Prince of Wales Lead, 3000 feet for 41 men. A quartz block
claim, Cobblers Reef, 3000 feet by 500 feet for 64 men. An
alluvial block claim, S.C. Mobeck and 63 others, 2000 by 640
feet. An alluvial Block claim, Augustus Sheppard and
party,&mdash; men, 1320 by 760 feet, £105,000. One quartz battery
of 16 head of stamps. One 50 Horse power steam engine, winding
engine, 25 Horse power engine and three puddling machines, Office
houses, outhouses, machine house, Engine house, Battery house.
Blacksmith's shop, Storeroom, Firewood 2000 Cord, Rails, Ropes,
Chain Ropes, Large pump and small surface pump. Long Tom, Cradle
£10,200. Total, £115,200.</blockquote>
<p>Then follows the usual array of signatures and seals to this
new departure, and after that we come to a fresh set of folios
under date 15th November, 1866, setting forth that "at two of the
clock P.M. a majority in number and value of the shareholders
being present" at an extraordinary meeting, the capital was
increased to £208,575, in 8343 shares of £25 each; the same to be
"increased" by giving to the Albion Company 3223 shares of £25
each in settlement of that company's claim for ground taken by
the Prince of Wales Company. This was the last and biggest burst
of the company in the matter of parchment display. There is twice
as much space covered with signatures and share details this time
as ever before, and the absence from some folios of previous
columns of tiny seals is compensated for by two great crimson
ones of nearly the dimensions of the Cope-muffin type. But there
was also a new feature in the form of a photograph of a
weird-looking, scratchy, pen and ink sketch of intricate
claim-boundaries, showing the involved lines of the manifold
frontage systems, a memorandum of apportionment of scrip, the
signatures of the contracting directors, and two little black
seals as symbols of the two companies, in settlement of what was
too often a business too dark for satisfactory apprehension.
Another extraordinary meeting followed on the 30th July, 1869,
reducing the number of directors from nine to seven, and at
another on the 2nd December, 1870, as set forth in several
folios, the directors were empowered to forfeit and sell shares
on which calls had remained unpaid seven days. This regulation is
signed by "John Embling, chairman of the meeting", and
underneath, and ending this strange eventful history of corporate
and regulational change, we have the following relatively brief
finial, but still in big black German and other text:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>At a meeting of the company duly held, it was moved
by Mr. George Coleman Robinson, seconded by Mr. James Slater and
carried, That the minutes of Resolutions passed on the 2nd day of
December one thousand eight hundred and seventy be confirmed.
John Dane, Chairman of the meeting, F.W. Tatham, Manager of the
Company.</blockquote>
<p>Although there is no date to this last bit, it was probably a
record of what took place at an ordinary or special meeting as
soon as the other was over, and as legally necessary as a
sequence to what went before. Amid all the paroxysms of change,
in all the exits and entrances of signatories set out in this
waste of sheepskin, there is one constant person. He is like
Tennyson's brook. "F.W. Tatham, manager", goes on from start to
finish. The first agony in 1864 was that of passing from the
primitive condition of co-operation to that of incorporation
under Statute, with the original shares converted into scrip. In
this process there had to be a larger number of scrip given to
the holders of sleeping shares, halves, quarters, eighths, or
what not, than to the holders of working interests, as these last
had to work or pay for substitutes, while the holder of the
sleeping interest had no labor liability. Thus, in the first
issue of scrip by the Prince of Wales Company, a full original
share was made into 40 scrip, of which the sleeping half had 24,
and the working half 16. So the Great Extended Company, Redan,
turned its shares into 60 scrip, and gave 34 to the sleeping and
26 to the working holder. The apportionment of interests in the
Nelson and Wellington Company, under the Limited Liability Act,
in 5570 scrip, on the 4th August, 1864, was 40 scrip to each of
139¼ twelfth shares. But some holders had 10ths in the original
partition, and received 50 scrip; others originally had 8ths, and
received 60 scrip; whilst 58 scrip were allotted to each original
share in the Bullock Horn claim, absorbed in the Nelson and
Wellington. The difference in market value of working and
sleeping interests will be seen in the following prices
advertised on the 19th August, 1862, by S. Goujon,
sharebroker:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>One full Nelson 10th, £2100; a square half Nelson,
£1050; a sleeping quarter 8th Nelson, £675. On the same date
Michael Walsh advertised:&mdash;One Albion, £1850; ½ working
Albion, £675; ½ sleeping Great Extended, £1700; ½ working ditto,
£1400; 1 Cosmopolitan, £1900; ½ sleeping ditto, £1150; ½ working
ditto, £760; quarter 12th Nelson, £350; 1 Prince of Wales, £2000;
½ working ditto, £800; 1 great Republic, £900; ½ sleeping ditto,
£600.</blockquote>
<p>The year 1864 was the first year in which these
transformations took place. Then, too, began the larger and more
complex and more costly disputes, weary equity suits bristling
with attorneys and barristers, and with costs incurred in
coursing from court to court. Titles became more involved as
local regulations and statutory law gave opportunities to
"jumpers" who discovered that somebody's miner's right had
expired, or somebody never had one, or found flaws in the mode in
which a claim had been measured, or pegged out, or registered, or
worked. The Prince of Wales Company paid large sums for clerical
labor alone in connection with such difficulties, and that was
but the poor fringe to an aggregate of over £13,000 costs for
encroachment and other disputes.</p>
<p>If an old Golden Point digger of 1851, looking into his little
shallow hole, rich as a jeweller's shop, or, as bullock-driver
Hannington says, like a ginger-bread basket, had seen below, in
the uprising future, the long law suits and the monstrous bills
of costs, the worry, the waste of time and energy, he would have
recoiled in horror. Affrighted by the vision he would, surely,
have fled with foot as fleet as fabled Mercury's, and left all
the gilded promises of the unknown for the more sober certainties
of a less fascinating, but more certain, industry. The sacred
thirst broke out very early in claim disputes, and it is only
within the last few years that mining has come to be less heavily
weighted with law and lawyers. The period of Local Court and
Mining Board regulations was the halcyon time of the attorneys
and barristers and their prompters the jumpers, but as frontages
gave way to blocks, and as the leads reached private property and
leaseholds came into vogue, litigation grew less and less, and
the exhausting journeys from Court of Mines, to the Supreme
Court, and from there to the Privy Council were almost mere
matters of history. Nothing but the great richness of the mines
saved the litigant period from being one of general ruin. The
Prince of Wales Company obtained its first gold in 1860, some 63
ozs. being won up to 20th September of that year. Altogether the
company obtained 164,874 ozs. of alluvial gold and 44,196 ozs. of
quartz gold, and, after surviving all its costly transformations
and disputes, paid £250,894 in dividends to its long suffering
shareholders.</p>
<p>More famous suits were those of the United Hand-in-Hand and
Band of Hope, the Great Extended Redan, and the Kohi-noor
Companies, a kind of triangular battle over registration rights
to gutters which raged for years, rolled from court to court and,
after an outlay of £60,000 in law, ended, as such disputes often
did, in a compromise. For a time the combat was, generally, <i>à
outrance</i>, <a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href=
"#fn23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and even the mathematics ceased
in such conditions to be an exact science. Surveyors,
theodolites, calculations, the very properties of the angle and
the circle seemed to dissolve into thin air in the heat of those
conflicts, and distance, number, weight, color depended, it would
often seem, on the side for which the witness was called. The
arena was one in which the builder up of bills of costs found his
vocation abnormally easy, and the mining disputants bled with
alacrity. But sometimes the victim turned upon the operator and
criticised the demands made. Before us lies a printed address of
James Cotter, the manager of the Hand and Band Company, with
regard to a suit by Hardy and Madden, solicitors, "for recovery
of £288 claimed by them as a refund due in respect of their 1,152
shares." The solicitors won their case. Cotter was a tall, spare.
Irishman, with a quaint solemn mediæval-like face liable to
sudden lights of intelligent humor. His face reminded one of
those dull, saintly, effigies in old church windows, sadly serene
in shadow, almost severe in their immobile expression, then
suddenly a glint of sunlight comes and the figure is brighter
with radiant aureoles of a new and vivid and almost articulate
life. Him, the Court of Mines judge, Rogers, used to regard as a
witness conspicuous for veracity, and Cotter held that the
appellate judge, Molesworth, "failed to grasp the actual merits"
of his (Cotter's) evidence on the bill of costs, and thus
"through some error or mistake, quite inexplicable, arrived at an
erroneous, though no doubt a conscientious, judgment." The
dispute is cited merely to show how far the uncertainties of law
in mining matters could extend, and specially, how the bills of
costs arose. To that one firm of lawyers the company paid £5,551
7s. 3d. for a suit that dangled from January 1875 to August 1879
between the Ballarat Court of Mines and the London Privy Council.
From Trinity Term to Michaelmas, to Hillary, to Easter, to
Trinity again, the game was kept up in that particular suit in
which the solicitors in question acted for the company in the
Victorian Courts and by their London agent in the Privy Council
appeal, and Cotter publishes the items charged by the London
solicitor and by the Ballarat firm, the auditors finding a
difference of £124 18s. 6d. between the two accounts. Bat the
£5000 odd was only an item in the general sum of costs in one of
these long-winded suits, as from £40,000 to £50,000 was sometimes
the price paid for the luxury of a good stand-up fight in
equity.<br></p>

<p>Of all the celebrated mining suits here, the most celebrated
was that known as the Egerton case, in which Messrs. A.J.L.,
T.L., and S.L. Learmonth, the Ercildoun squatters, who had
purchased the Egerton mine in 1863, and in 1873 sold it by their
S.L. Learmonth to Martin Loughlin for £13,500, sued said
Loughlin, William Bailey, James Williamson, Owen Edward Edwards,
and an unnamed contingent called the Egerton Company. Bailey had
been the plaintiffs' mine manager, and sold, as their agent, to
Loughlin, joining Loughlin, Williamson, and Edwards thereupon as
equal partner. The plaintiffs' case in effect was that these four
defendants had played a comedy of fraud, in which Bailey, the
confidential adviser and agent of the plaintiffs, who was said to
have wept under pressure of antecedent gratitude for Learmonth
favors, and Loughlin, the purchaser, were star actors, and
Williamson, manager of the Union Bank, Ballarat, where the
purchasing cheques were honored, and Edwards, a broker at the
Corner, performed the parts of general utility men, whilst at the
back of the stage was a chorus of nondescripts who held 1000 of
the 25,000 scrip into which the chief actors had converted their
original shares. But if the chief plaintiff felt the logically
dramatic significance of his case, how the iron must have entered
his soul. For there had been that tender and touching prologue to
the play in the form of an interview between the confidential
manager and his employer, in which the former softening, as it
would seem, and almost</p>
<div class="quote" style="margin-left:15%;">Enamoured more, as
more remembrance swells<br>
With many a proof of recollected love,</div>
<p>became, for one short, soft moment, "like Niobe, all
tears."</p>
<p>The plaintiffs brought their suit in equity before Mr. Justice
Molesworth, and it subsequently took the form, before Chief
Justice Stawell and a special jury of twelve, of the live
following issues to be tried as an interlocutory
proceeding:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I. That the quartz contained in the mine, the subject
matter of this suit, before or on the 15th day of September,
1873, was richer in gold than the defendant William Bailey
represented to the plaintiff Sommerville Livingstone Learmonth.
II. That the defendant William Bailey did make a representation
to the plaintiff, S.L. Learmonth, of the value of the quartz in
the said mine, or of the value of the said mine false and to the
knowledge of the said defendant, and with the intention of
inducing the plaintiff to sell the said mine at an under value.
III. That the plaintiff, S.L. Learmonth, was induced by the
representations of the defendant, W. Bailey, as to the value of
the said mine or quartz therein to sell the mine to the
defendant, M. Loughlin, for the sum of £13,500. IV. That there
was on or previously to the 15th day of September, 1873, an
agreement or arrangement between the defendant, M. Loughlin, and
W. Bailey that the defendant, W. Bailey, should have a share of
the said mine after the sale thereof by the plaintiffs to the
defendant, M. Loughlin. V. That both the defendants, J.
Williamson, and O.E. Edwards, or one of them knew of the
existence of such agreement or arrangement at the time of their
or his entering into a bargain for the purchase of the
mine.</blockquote>
<p>The four chief defendants represented the four quarters of the
Imperial flag, and were all then in prime middle age. Bailey was
a tallish, light-complexioned, stoop-shouldered Saxon Englishman.
Loughlin was over six feet high, a dark complexioned Irishman,
with, perhaps, a strain of Hispano-Galway blood in him.
Williamson was a Scotchman, of broad make and middle height, and
fair complexion, one of Green's north of Tweed English. Edwards
was a light, mobile, middle-height Welshman, who spoke good
English with a Cambrian accent. Their answer to the plaintiffs'
suit was, in effect, that they were all as innocent as new born
babes. The poverty of the mine before the sale, and its richness
after the sale, were not coincidences of the type so delicately
hinted at by Mr. Weller, senior, but were events honest and true,
irrefragable as the postulated innocence of infancy. And so, in
sooth, they may have been. Mining luck is full of such sudden
changes.</p>
<p>S.L. Learmonth deposed that Loughlin had written on 1st
September, asking if the mine was for sale, and Learmonth,
remembering some former advice of Bailey's, replied that he would
sell for £50,000. Then, communicating with Bailey, Learmonth was
advised to sell for £12,000, as the mine had been yielding
poorly, and was only worth three years' purchase, Bailey saying
that he would not give more if he had a cart load of gold. Upon
this Bailey was authorised to sell, and did sell to Loughlin for
£13,500, receiving from Learmonth 5 per cent. commission on the
sale. Then the quadrilateral partnership was formed, the company
floated in 25,000 scrip, the quad holding nearly all the scrip,
and the output from the mine began to improve almost immediately,
Bailey admitting in the witness-box that up to the date of the
suit (14th March, 1876), he had received as his share of the gold
"about £30,000". The defence set forth a denial of the
allegations in the five cited issues, and an averment that "the
rich stone after the sale was owing to the discovering of the new
reef in the Rose (shaft)." Each side employed four barristers,
and the case was opened on the 14th March, 1876, before Chief
Justice Stawell and a special jury of twelve. Witnesses of all
classes from all parts of the colony gave evidence; plans and
models were used in profusion, and the public interest excited
was great, as the allegations and denials were often very
strongly opposed, and in the popular mind the unpopularity of the
rich squatter plaintiffs was pretty well balanced by the fact of
the sudden change in the mine's value after the mine had gone
from their possession. On the 3rd April the judge summoned up to
the jury; the jury could not agree, not even a majority of
three-fourths, and they were discharged.</p>
<p>Mr. Dovan, one of the jurymen, said at the close of the
judge's charge that he wished to make a statement which he
considered a duty to himself and his fellow jurymen. "Last
Wednesday evening a fellow came up to him in the interest of the
defendants and offered him £250 to stand out and give a verdict
on their side, and told him at the same time that they only
wanted one to complete the number to form a disagreement." When
the jury had announced their final failure to agree the judge
said to Dovan:&mdash;"Can you recognise the person you said spoke
to you f Dovan replied:&mdash;"Yes, I can give his name." His
Honor then discharged the jury.</p>
<p>The defendants won the battle along the whole line, injunction
motions, issues, everything, for when the plaintiffs made another
essay to get back the mine they fared worse, the jury finding for
the defendants on all the issues. Disconcerted, but not yet
vanquished, the plaintiffs obtained leave to appeal to the Privy
Council, but after a while began to treat with the defendants.
This sent the defendant company's shares up 5s. and, as it was
calculated that an absolute settlement would enhance their value
200 or 300 per cent., the defendants agreed to forego all claim
for costs, which were estimated at £26,000. The dispute was
settled on these terms, the plaintiffs' costs being about £50,000
or £60,000 of which, if rumor were not a liar, not less than
£15,000 was paid to one man to act as general overseer of the
fight for them.</p>
<p>This was the heaviest single suit in all Ballarat Mining
litigation. It seemed to close the belligerent period that
followed upon the advent of large companies and frontage
complications&mdash;the halcyon time of the unscrupulous jumper
and the fruitful source of disputes; just as the largest and most
disastrous of the Ballarat conflagrations closed the specially
igneous period of old Ballarat. Cotter, who had large experience
in law-fights, argues in favor of the union of the two branches
of the profession as a mode of cheapening law. He says that when
Barrister M'Dermott returned to Victoria from New Zealand he
consulted with clients without the attorney go-between, and he
was boycotted by the attorneys for a while. But his action,
according to Cotter's statement, reduced the cost of counsel's
opinion from £12 to £2 13s. 4d., or in the case of Mr. Webb (now
Mr. Justice Webb) to £3 13s. 4d.</p>
<p>The Honorable Thomas Livingstone Learmonth, M.L.C., had been
taken away, by Providence or a desire to settle for his latter
days in the old land, from the evil days of litigation which had
come upon his brother Somerville in person as the remaining
representative of the firm. Thomas was a public man, and a
religious and charitable man, in a more prominent sense than any
of his brothers, and when he left the colony for Britain there
was a public recognition of his personal worth as an old colonist
and dutiful citizen. On the 6th October, 1868, a soiree was given
in his honor in the hall of the Mechanics' Institute, the late
Robert Lewis presiding, and addresses expressive of remembrance
of his many public services, his large enterprise, and his much
appreciated philanthropy, were presented to the guest. One was on
behalf of "the inhabitants of Ballarat and the surrounding
districts," and another was from the Agricultural and Pastoral
Society. The former referred to the changes Mr. Learmonth had
seen since he first settled in the district, and in reply he
said:&mdash;"You have alluded to the wonderful changes I have
seen. They are indeed wonderful, for within twenty years I have
seen a flock of sheep, tended by its solitary shepherd, feeding
on the very spot on which this stately hall is built, and where
this busy city, with its golden treasures, is carrying on the
business and bustle of life."</p>
<p>The Browns leases dispute was a turbulent instance of the
conflict of claims arising out of conflicting mine boundaries,
and the costly uncertainty of mining law. Within four years after
the Eureka Stockade the leasing disputes occurred, and revived
for a time the excitement which had glared up over the frontage
regulations issue at the Mining Board election on the 14th July,
1856. The dispute at Browns was caused by the granting, under
leasing regulations gazetted on the 23rd December, 1858, of a
lease to Duncan and party, known as the Great Britain Company.
The lease was of an area 1200 feet square, or 33 acres, on the
Contest Lead, in the Smythesdale Division of the district, and it
was opposed by 96 miners forming the Washington, Banner of War,
Better Late than Never, and Victoria Companies. The lead was
proclaimed in November, 1857, under the frontage bylaws, and
claims were duly registered; but many were soon abandoned, and
then they were taken up with extended areas under regulations
existing for that purpose, the subsequently leased area being one
of the areas so taken up on the 1st September, 1858, taken up
with the increased area as a protection under the plea of
prospecting for the lead ahead of the last known place of the
gutter. We have no space for all desirable particulars, and it
must suffice to say that after great excitement, questionings of
bylaws by the warden, Lowther, costly suits in the courts,
incipient riots, the lessees were forcibly put in possession by
Crown Lands Commissioner Sherard and sixty foot and twenty-five
mounted troopers on the 25th May, 1859. A Select Committee of
Parliament sat on the business afterwards, and found that all the
facts in the lease affair had not been officially presented to
the Government, and that though the bylaws of the Mining Board
were of doubtful legality, still, "if Mr. Warden Lowther had duly
and properly carried out the bylaws, no dispute would have
arisen; and if he had reported all the facts to the Government,
the Government would not have deemed it just or politic to grant
the leases." The anti-lessees claimed compensation for losses to
the extent of £12,256, and the Select Committee recommended
compensation to the ninety-six miners interested, but Parliament
declined to adopt the advice thus given, and all the compensation
obtained by the miners was £30 a man paid by the lessees in
settlement of the dispute.</p>
<p>There were a few Chinese gold digging in Ballarat as early as
1852, but there was no rising of the "yellow agony" in the
district till the year 1873, when a dispute at Clunes led to a
disturbance of the peace on the 9th December. There had been a
strike of the miners employed in the Lothair mine, as the
directors refused to give a Saturday afternoon holiday shift as
was generally the custom. The directors pleaded that the miners
had no right to demand a holiday shift without a rateable
reduction of the two guineas a week wage, and, moreover, that as
the Lothair mine was in wet and swelling alluvial country the
works could not be safely left idle as if it were a dry quartz
mine. There was a long series of palavers between the disputants
and finally the miners struck work, supported therein by the
Association then formed there. The directors of the mine,
including Mr. Francis (then Premier), and Mr. Lalor, the whilom
hero of freedom, &amp;c., at the Eureka Stockade, decided to
counter-plot against the strikers by employing Chinese labor, of
which Creswick and Ballarat offered an ample supply. The Chinese
were detested as an inferior race, as the harbingers of degrading
pagan immorality, and as alien competitors for the bread which
the miners required for themselves and families. By Monday, the
8th December, the miners had information respecting the
employment of Chinese, and at once made a demonstration in force.
About 500 men of the Miners Association, headed by the Clunes
Brass Band, and armed with pick-handles, battens, and waddies
marched about the town, many women accompanying them. At midnight
the fire bell was rung, and the crowd went to the Lothair mine,
ordered up the few men who were still below, and when they
refused and could not be found in the mine the shaft was covered
over and cages lowered upon the covering. The crowd then put
ropes round a building prepared for the Chinese and pulled it
down. Daylight of the 9th soon dawned, the bells were rung again,
and over a thousand men, women, and children moved to the
toll-gate on the Creswick road, and took possession of it and the
contiguous fences. Lothair directors were approaching with a
caravan of Chinese and police, but hearing of the hostile crowd
turned off by the Tourella road to enter Clunes by the Ballarat
road, and the miners at once rushed across to the new line of
march and erected a barricade of timber, stones, ploughs,
harrows, ropes and other obstructions. The caravan, headed by a
coach driven by McPhee, its owner, by whose side sat Sergeant
Larner, of the police, rapidly approached the barricade. A storm
of missiles from the defenders of the barricade poured upon the
caravan, and so heavy was the onslaught upon the Chinese that the
police had to abandon their attempt to carry the barricade and
return to the beleagured caravan. An order to retreat was given,
and the caravan turned back on the way it came. The Sandhurst
miners caught the excitement, and threatened to march to the aid
of their brethren at Clunes. Mr. Blanchard, the mayor of Clunes,
who was also president of the Miners' Association, and Mr.
Phillips, M.L.A. espoused the action of the miners, the more
emotional of the commentators in the Press championed their
doings, and some were silly enough to compare the riot to the
stand made at the Eureka Stockade. This was not wonderful if not
very wise, for the business was a medley of conflicting legal and
moral rights. The Lothair directors were within the law, and the
rioters were violating the law. But the miners had the whole
moral weight of the argument on their side, and if the Lothair
directors had shown more tact they would, probably, have found it
as easy to carry on the mine as other Clunes managements had
carried on theirs. The refusal of concession was a blunder, the
employment of Chinese was a blunder, and the sending an armed
police escort was a blunder. This was felt by the authorities,
and so it was that nobody was prosecuted, and even the anomaly of
the mayor being also a rioter, or an apologist of the rioters,
was passed over.</p>
<p>The jumper&mdash;so called from the primitive digger who
jumped into an unoccupied shallow hole&mdash;has always been one
of the troubles of mining life. He sometimes was honest and did
good work, and sometimes was a rogue and did great wrong. The
Pleasant Creek jumps of 1872-3 were famous for the excitement
they created all over Victoria. Ballarat men were the jumpers,
and they sought to get possession of quartz ground at Stawell, on
the plea that it had been shepherded for ten years. The shepherds
were rich, and there was a great fight in the courts, besides
threats of physical force disturbances. Public meetings were held
in Ballarat and elsewhere, a "Pleasant Creek Jumps Company" was
formed, and after a long struggle the wealthy shepherds made
terms with the chief jumpers, paid their costs, and got back the
ground, to the great disgust of the general body of shareholders
in the Jumps Company.</p>
<p>One of the uglier forms of mining dispute was the physical
force tactics sometimes adopted by the disputants and the men in
their employment. These methods were, in underground encroachment
cases, sometimes dangerous to health and life. Drives were
barricaded and defended <i>vi et armis</i>. <a name="FNanchor_24"
id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#fn24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Sometimes water was let out to overwhelm the enemy, and sometimes
stink pots were used. The encroachment dispute between the Prince
of Wales and Albion Companies in 1866 was made infamous by the
use of stink pots. The legal manager of the Prince of Wales
Company writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>On account of its being such a serious crime, and
hard to bring home to the real offenders, the prosecution was
abandoned. I believe we could have proved who it was that
purchased the deleterious drugs which were placed in our drives
to prevent the men working, and which, if not discovered in time,
would most certainly have destroyed more lives than one. The
<i>modus operandi</i> <a name="FNanchor_25" id=
"FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#fn25" class="fnanchor"><big>[25]</big></a> was
simple enough, though I cannot say what drug was used; probably
acetic acid, such as the plumbers use. I did not see it, but I
can imagine a quantity poured into a vessel with copper
scraps.</blockquote>
<p>The latest jumping essay of special significance was an
attempt in December, 1886, by near a hundred men to get
possession "of that portion of the Band and Albion Consols claim,
known as the No. 9 lease, and on which is the No. 9 shaft."
Consols stock fell a few shillings in the market at once, but
revived next day, and nothing more was heard of the business,
save a plea by the jumpers that they only applied for some
private property lots. The attempt and not the deed confounded
them.</p>
<p>Three decades had gone, after the gold discovery, before a law
was passed to legalise mining on private property, but scarce one
had passed when mining leases on private property were in vogue.
The first in the Ballarat district was for the Learmonth
pre-emptive at Buninyong, applied for by Messrs. D. FitzPatrick,
S. Irwin, and J. Victor, who also were the earliest appointed
justices of the peace in Ballarat. That application fell through,
and a lease of the ground was obtained by H. Cuthbert, solicitor,
since then a member of the Legislative Council and a member of
several Cabinets. In 1860 D. and P. FitzPatrick obtained a lease
of Egan's Corinella Estate, near Daylesford, and after that
mining leases became common both on private and on Crown lands.
But the agitation for a private property law went on, and for the
course of some thirty years Ballarat fought hard at intervals in
mining boards, and committees, and in the press, but the question
was shelved by the Parliament. For the people who voted and paid
were "mostly fools", and the game went on till the political
state of the country was so rank and corrupt that even manhood
suffrage began to stir itself and call for reform. Then came the
era of railway and civil service boards to restrict political
patronage, and with these things there also came a law to
legalise mining on private property.</p>
<p>Some of the Australian mining ventures were floated wholly or
in part upon capital obtained in Great Britain. Excepting the
Port Phillip Quartz Mining Company, of which mention is made
hereafter, the only notable local instance of that kind was the
Winter's Freehold Company which Mr. (now Colonel) W.C. Smith went
to London, in 1868, to launch. A farewell banquet was given to
him on the 9th September of that year, in the Alfred Hall, Mayor
Davey, of Ballarat West, presiding, and the occasion was made the
vehicle for conveying to Mr. Smith very hearty recognitions of
his many and valuable services to Ballarat as municipal
councillor, mining promoter, and parliamentary representative.
With Mr. Smith, went to London Mr. Ligar, ex-surveyor general of
Victoria, and Mr. Thomas Carpenter, a mining engineer, but the
embassy was in the main a failure. The ambassadors were nobodies
in London, and their bait was not attractive enough to the London
Exchange. All that was done was to leave the project in the hands
of broker Thomas Dicker, of the <i>Mining Record</i>, who placed
1,455 of the 12,960 shares composing the company's stock. This
was, in fact, the third and final company. First, there was a
company for boring for the lead, and that began to bore in
October, 1866. Then a company to purchase the land was formed, an
area of 1,360 acres being bought from Mr. John Winter for £50,000
cash, near £40 an acre being paid for land whose intrinsic value
was about £3 an acre only. The company ceased mining in
September, 1877, after spending £390,000, and having at the close
of operations a debit balance of £33,000 at the Bank of Victoria.
The bank, in fact, foreclosed, took possession, carried on the
mine for eighteen months, and then the mine was abandoned. During
its operations the company raised £89,518 14s. 8d. worth of gold.
The bank raised very little comparatively, and only partially
recouped itself by the sale of plant and freehold.</p>
<p>The only other venture of any importance launched in the
Ballarat district with foreign capital is the Port Phillip and
Colonial G.M. Co., at Clunes. This company was established in
London, at the end of 1851, with a capital of £500,000,
afterwards reduced to £125,000, the amount paid up being £100,000
in £1 shares. A staff, with a number of miners, stores,
implements, &amp;c., was sent out early in 1852, and a few months
after that the present manager, Mr. R.H. Bland, was placed on the
board of directors in London, and was appointed to take charge of
the company in the colony. Mr. Bland arrived in Melbourne in
August of that year. After some ventures in and around Ballarat,
the company took up its present mine at Clunes under lease from
the owner in 1857, work being commenced in March of that year. As
there was at that time a difficulty in working the mine by the
London company alone, an arrangement was made with a party of
local miners, who formed themselves into the Clunes Quartz Mining
Company, and have from that time till the present worked in
conjunction with the Port Phillip and Colonial Company. The
amount of capital expended in opening up the mine and erecting
machinery was £19,500, of which the Clunes Company contributed
£1,500, and since then a large amount from the profits of the
mine has been expended in additions to the plant. Of the £100,000
capital called up in the Port Phillip and Colonial Company, only
£27,000 was called after Mr. Bland's appointment to the control
of the company's operations in Victoria. By courtesy of the
manager we have the following statement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The following is the return of quartz raised and
crushed at the mine from 1857 to 29th September,
1885:&mdash;Quartz raised and crushed, 1,307,727 tons; amount of
gold obtained, 512,881 oz. 18 dwt.; value of the same, £2,056,552
6s. 10d. Profit obtained and divided as follows:&mdash;The Port
Phillip Company, £225,028 19s. 4d.; Clunes Q.M.C., £118,415 2s.
11d.; proprietors' royalty, £138,877 11s. 7d.&mdash;total,
£482,321 13s. 10d. The highest yield of gold in any one year was
1 oz. 9 dwt. per ton. The lowest yield was 3 dwt. 23 gr.: and the
total average was 7 dwt. 9 gr. The largest quantity of quartz
crushed in any one year was 70,222 tons. The total quantity of
pyrites saved and treated was 7496 tons; gold obtained, 28,705
oz. 15 dwt.; value, £116,319 4s. 2d.; profit on the same, £88,899
15s. 9d. The plant consists of:&mdash;At the north
shaft&mdash;(driven by steam supplied by three boilers): 1
winding engine, 24-inch cylinder; 1 pumping engine, 24-inch
cylinder; 1 capstan engine, 10 inch cylinder; 1 Root's blower,
driven by a 6-inch engine. South shaft: 1 engine and 1 boiler.
Reducter works: 1 engine, 24-inch cylinder, driving 80 head of
stamps, 2 stone-breaking machines, 6 buddles, 2 Chilian mills, 4
amalgamating barrels; 1 12-inch engine (supplied with steam from
five multitubular boilers).</blockquote>
<p>A movement was made in 1886 to drain the Sebastopol plateau,
two plans being suggested, one by an adit tunnel starting near
the Napoleons Lead, the other by a powerful pumping plant on the
plateau. It was proposed to obtain State aid in both cases,
either in the form of a cash subsidy or by statutory right to
levy royalties or other contributions Nothing has yet been done
towards realising either scheme.</p>
<p>In response to a louder call than usual for State aid in the
shape of a larger prospecting grant, £80,000 was voted by
Parliament in 1886, and local Prospecting Boards were created to
receive applications for aid and report thereon to the Minister
of Mines. The Ballarat board was elected on the 1st December last
and consisted of Messrs. T. Richards, for the Mining Board; the
Hon. H. Gore, M.L.C., for the Mine Owners; G. Williams, for the
Miners' Association; City Mayor Thompson, for the Local Bodies;
and Mr. J. Lynch, surveyor, for the Government; Mr. J.M. Bickett
being appointed secretary. Each of the seven mining districts of
the colony claimed an equal share of the vote, applications
poured in with torrential plenitude, the boards sifted them, made
their reports to the Minister, and then it was discovered that
the Government included the cost of diamond drill work in the
charges upon the vote which was thus reduced to less than half
the £80,000. Thereupon arose a violent storm of gold-fields
indignation, and threats of dire political vengeance hurtled
through the air both inside and outside Parliament.</p>
<p>The Kohinoor Company, on the Golden Point Lead, commenced
operations early in the year 1857, began driving in the latter
half of 1858, and paid the first dividend on the 25th June, 1859.
The area of the claim was 170 acres. There were 4 shafts, 8000
feet of drives, 2 steam engines, 3 boilers, 4 puddling machines,
and the usual other belongings to a first-class company's plant,
value £22,000. The company had expended £286,845 19s. 6d. up to
November, 1869; had won 147,570 oz. 15 dwt. 7 gr. of gold, value
at £4 per oz., £590,283; and had paid £304,460 in dividends. It
must be noted that Ballarat gold has realised generally more than
£4 per oz., but we have adopted that as a sufficiently accurate
basis of calculation. The company was one of the very best
ventures ever launched upon the alluvium of this gold-field.</p>
<p>The Band of Hope and Albion Consols Company is a corporation
formed by two companies, the Albion Company on the Frenchman's
Lead, and the Band of Hope Company on the Golden Point Lead. The
Albion Company was the first which tested ground in Victoria by
boring operations before sinking. The first bore was commenced
under the auspices of Messrs. Elder, Campbell, and others, on the
21st June, 1856, when what is now the borough of Sebastopol, and
the greater portion of the borough of Ballarat West, were still
unreclaimed bush country. The company began its shaft on the 4th
of June, 1858, sinking through clays, drifts, and basaltic and
schistose rocks to a depth of 475 feet. By the year 1868 the
company had obtained gold realising £254,144, had paid £117,995
in calls, and £90,921 in dividends. The Band of Hope Company
began sinking in March, 1858, after previous boring. Unusual
difficulties were encountered in heavy flows of drift and
rock-water, for it took the company five years to sink the No. 1
shaft 340 feet, and put in a drive 180 feet, the shaft not being
sunk 400 feet till April, 1866. In September of that year the
company united with the Hand-in-Hand Company to work certain
portion of the two companies' claims. The company procured the
heaviest engines obtainable, lighted its mine with gas, and
carried on operations upon the grandest scale then known here. It
raised 700 tons of washdirt a day, and obtained as much as 1637
oz. of gold from one day's washing. Having bought and expensively
altered the shaft of the extinct Golden Gate Company on the Redan
Lead, it began, after boring, to sink a third shaft south of the
Smythesdale road in November, 1865, and on the 26th September,
1866, a fourth shaft was begun in the centre of the Redan
Racecourse. Up to the date of union with the Hand-in-Hand Company
the Band of Hope Company had spent £29,565 on the No. 1 shaft,
and £101,955 on alterations in and driving from the No. 2 shaft.
The No. 3 shaft cost £11,859 in sinking, and the No. 4 shaft a
nearly similar sura, and in all over £3000 were spent by the
company in boring operations. Up to a date a few months previous
to joining the Albion Company, the company had excavated and
washed two and a half millions of cubic feet of auriferous
alluvium and schist, from which 161,943 oz. of gold were
obtained, value £656,869, yielding in dividends £388,000. On the
7th March, 1869, the United Hand-in-Hand and Band of Hope Company
united with the Albion Company, forming the incorporated Band of
Hope and Albion Consols Company; capital £449,000, in 22,450
shares of £20 paid up; area held, about 400 acres. The company's
plant then included 11 engines, 14 boilers, and 16 puddling
machines, besides buddies. In September, 1869, nineteen horses
were employed in the underground works of the mine; 900 men,
exclusive of splitters and others in the bush, were employed by
the company, and the monthly expenditure of the company in
working the mine was £10,600.</p>
<p>By the courtesy of Mr. Serjeant, the manager, the author is
able to append the following later details of this mine, which is
now a quartz mine only, and is still the premier mine of
Ballarat:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Up to the date of amalgamation, the gold won by the
Albion Company was 84,324 oz.; by the United Extended Band of
Hope Company, 188,490 oz.; and by the present company from the
date of amalgamation to March, 1879, 246,737 oz. 6 dwt. 3
gr.&mdash;total 519,551 oz. 6 dwt. 3 gr., all from alluvial, and
of the value of £2,078,235 9s. 2d. Early in 1879 quartz of a
payable character was discovered at the company's No. 6 shaft at
a depth of 268 feet, and up to the 30th of December, 1886, we
raised and crushed 190,970 tons of stone, which produced 123,480
oz. 8 dwt. 14 gr., including 3283 oz. 13 dwt. 12 gr., from 1807
tons pyrites, value £509,355 19s. 9d.; total value of gold from
all sources being £2,566,752 8s. 8d. The dividends paid amounted,
at the close of 1886, to £1,134,101 15s., showing that
shareholders have received £44 3s. 8d. per cent. of the gross
value of the gold obtained. The above total is made up as
follows:&mdash;United Extended Band of Hope, £446,400; Albion,
£153,391 15s.; Band of Hope and Albion Consols, £314,861 5s.;
do., do. (from quartz), £219,448 153. The plant consists of 13
engines, equal to 393 horse power nominal, 12 boilers, 70 heads
of stamps, 1 steam hammer, 2 lathes, 1 slotting machine, 1
shaping machine, 1 Denny's concentrator, 2 Wheeler and Wilson's
pans, 10 Halley's shaking tables, 6 amalgamating barrels, 1 stone
crusher, 1 air compressor&mdash;valued at £15,000 7s. During
1881, after repeated trials, coal was introduced as an article of
fuel, the results showing 1 ton of coal to be equal to 5 tons (50
feet to the ton) firewood. The present consumption is 60 tons
coal and 100 tons of wood weekly. The former at 28s. per ton
shows a considerable saving compared with the latter at 6s. 6d.
per ton. The consumption of fuel in the stamp-house is estimated
at the rate of 1 ton of wood to 5 tons of quartz. The stampers,
with shank and disc complete, weigh 8 cwt., and have a drop of 8
inches. They strike from 70 to 75 blows per minute, and require 8
gallons of water per minute for each head of stampers. Each
stamper is capable of reducing daily (24 hours) from 2½ to 3 tons
of hard stone, to pass through 160 holes to the square inch.
Various samples of material have been used for permanent heads,
and for shoes and false bottoms. For heads we find they are less
liable to split when about 10 per cent. of wrought iron scrap is
mixed with the cast metal. For shoes, the Lal Lal is the best we
get. It is quite as hard as hematite, and possesses a toughness
which hematite does not. We have also tried cast steel, which is
far more durable than iron; but this is an imported article, and
the charges at the Customs house is greater than the total cost
of iron. The concentrated sulphides collected by means of
Halley's tables are roasted before being treated for the gold
they contain. The bye products are sulphur, arsenic, and sesqui
oxide of iron. The latter we grind with oil for paint, which
finds ready sale among boiler-makers, bridge-builders, and
ship-owners. Of arsenic, we have a surplus, and the sulphur is
not collected. The cost connected with mining and crushing the
quartz is estimated at 5 dwt. per ton, and the cost of treating
the pyrites at £2 per ton. No. 7 is 1300 feet, and No. 10 shaft
is 1200 deep, and have been opened out at 13 levels. The greatest
depth from which quartz has yet been raised is 1200 feet. The
claim covers 193 acres of ground, chiefly held under lease. We
employ 230 hands, and our fortnightly pay sheet, including wood
and timber, carters and trade accounts, amount to an average of
£1200. We pay captains 7s. 11d. per shift, facemen 7s., truckers
5s., 5s. 6d., bracemen, platmen, and laborers 6s., enginemen 7s.
6d.</blockquote>
<p>In 1870, when the first edition of this work appeared, the
Consols Company had let some of its shafts on tribute, and in
giving that information Mr. Serjeant added the subjoined
statement, which is of interest, as showing the difference in the
scale of operations:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The company, therefore, has only two shafts now at
work in its own hands. At these about 500 men are employed, and
the rate of wages has been altered as compared with the rate in
November, 1869:&mdash;Captains, from £3 5s. per week to £2 10s.;
facemen, from £2 5s. to £2 2s.; truckers, bracemen, platmen,
puddling-men, laborers, from £2 2s to £2; sluicemen, from £3 to
£2 10s.; engine-drivers, 8s. 4d. and 7s 6d. per day&mdash;"Sunday
gratis"-when required. There are eight boilers now in use, eight
puddling-machines, nine horses, and the monthly expenditure now
is £5000.</blockquote>
<p>The wage is, as shown before, now paid per shift of eight
hours, and there is now no "Sunday gratis". Evidence of the
magnitude of the alluvial and quartz operations in the area held
by this company is found in the fact that thirty-two miles of
alluvial driving were excavated, and four miles of quartz
driving, exclusive of stoping strips.</p>
<p>The Llanberris Q.M. Company is the oldest quartz company in
Ballarat, the claim having been taken up by sixteen men in
September, 1858, and the first crushing had in the next
September, the produce of the mine to the end of 1863 being 6391
oz. of gold, value £25,469, from which £9,052 were paid in
dividends. In October, 1864, the co-operative company was made a
registered one in 2,000 shares in which £13,400 have been paid in
dividends from a total output value £76,896. The company's
present claim includes the New Enterprise mine, which in one year
gave to the original (sixteen) holders 16,000 ozs. of gold from
quartz and a profit of £750 per man. The Learmonth Brothers, of
subsequent Egerton fame, bought the New Enterprise, erected a new
plant, and then sold to the Llanberris company. The Llanberris
mine, taken in its entirety now, occupies the site of the
confluence of the Red Streak, Canadian, and Red Hill alluvial
gutters in the Gum Tree Flat, and in working the alluvial the
eastern quartz lode presented at one place a perpendicular wall
18 feet high. This was known to Thomas Jones, of Llanberis, in
Wales; he helped to form the Llanberris company, but the
registrar spelled the name with two r's and hence the present
style of the company. The mine is not a rich mine, but the
company worked so economically that on a less than 3 dwt. average
per ton debts were discharged and dividends paid. A rich thin
golden strike of slates, known as the Indicator, traverses the
Ballarat East belt of lodes, and it has lately helped to enrich
the Llanberris workings.</p>
<p>The Black Hill Quartz Company is another example of success
upon small average returns. The registrar, reporting in 1870,
says of that company:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The Black Hill Company began work in January, 1862,
and from that time to the end of December, 1809, embracing a
period of eight years, they have obtained the quantities of
quartz and gold set down hereunder:&mdash;Quartz crushed, 250,575
tons; gold got therefrom, 36,185 oz. 15 dwt. 10 gr.; average per
ton, 2 dwt. 21.31 gr.; total value, £145,541 6s. 3d.; total
dividends, £21,730, being 10 per cent. per annum on the capital.
The last dividend was paid in 1868.</blockquote>

<br>
<span class="u">Madame Berry G.M. C<sup><u>o</u></sup>. Shaft
Creswick near Ballarat.</span></p>
<br>
<p>In 1880 the company altered its constitution to that of a no
liability company, in 14,880 shares, dividends amounting to
£4,088 being paid under the new organisation, and in all, from
the beginning to the present date, £31,130. The old mine has not
been very productive for the last year or two, and tribute
parties have been working parts of the ground with but moderate
results.</p>
<p>The New North Clunes Company was started in 1859, Esmond, the
gold discoverer, being one of the shareholders, and the company's
mine has been one of the best in the district. The first gold was
obtained on the 5th October, 1867, and up to the end of May,
1887, there had been crushed 424,461 tons of quartz for 241,802
ozs. of gold; value, at £4 per ounce, £967,208. The total amount
of dividends paid to the same date was £516,056, or £251 per
2,056th share.</p>
<p>Among the many alluvial projects in Ballarat which never grew
to fruition was the Grand Trunk Leads or Great River Company.
This was a magnificent venture, on paper, in 6,000 shares of £5
each, for working "the continuation of the four rich trunk
gutters of Ballarat, namely, the Golden Point, Inkermann, Redan,
and Frenchman's
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;
or nearly five miles of gutters held under the frontage system."
This was at the end of the fifties or beginning of the sixties,
and the area taken up lay where the Royal Park and Alfredton now
are. Other interests militated against the success of the
project, and the area was subsequently absorbed in the
territories held by other companies.</p>
<p>For many years the alluvial deposits in Ballarat Proper have
been exhausted, and the bulk of gold won in the Central Division
has been quartz gold. This was foreseen in 1870, when the first
edition of this History appeared; but a great revival of alluvial
mining began in the Creswick Division in the early seventies.
This was caused by the success of Graham, Brawn, and others at
Broomfield Gully, in shallow ground. Their success led to the
starting of the Lewer's Freehold Company on the 22nd July, 1872,
the first party comprising Messrs. W.P. Jones, S. Fyson, H. Gore,
T. Rossell, W. Curten, E. and G. Daws, Rev. J. Wagg, W.J.
Gillard, R. Henden, J. Riordan, J.M. Davies, G. Westcott, Alex.
Stewart, W. Saville, and Alex. Rogers. The first washing was on
the 8th April, 1873, when 28 oz. of gold were obtained. This led
to a great rush; the shallow ground was traced till the famous De
Murska, Ristori, Lone Hand, and Madame Berry gutters were
discovered, and nearly the whole of the country between Creswick
and the Loddon taken up for mining. The rich deposits and the
deep ground recalled the old days of Ballarat itself, and the
locality is now the only largely productive alluvial field in
Victoria. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the whole of the
territory was private property, the Birches and the Hepburns, of
the pastoral epoch, or their successors, vendees or assigns,
being lords of the soil. The fortunate element was the freedom
from the jumper and the other risks of Crown land regulations;
the unfortunate element was the royalty tax imposed upon the
miner by the land-owners. Early in 1875, by which time the
shallow rush had reached the edge of deep deposits and given
expectation of a large and profitable field, a band of Ballarat
capitalists bought 6000 acres of Birch's estate, at £6 an acre,
from Alexander Wilson, the owner at that time. This band
consisted of Messrs. M. Loughlin, W. Bailey, E.C. Moore, J.A.
Chalk, R. Orr, D. Ham, E. Morey, and H. Gore, who called their
company the Seven Hills Estate Company. The company was
registered under the Trading Companies' Statute, in 200 shares of
£250 each, and their land was taken up by the famous Ristori,
West Ristori, Loughlin, West Loughlin, Lone Hand, Lord Harry,
Berry Consols, and Madame Berry G.M. Companies, upon whom a
royalty of seven and a-half per cent. of the gold won was levied,
with one per cent. extra when an extension of leases was
required. In May, 1881, the Seven Hills Estate Company was
registered in 10,000 shares of £20 each, but very few of the
original company's shares changed hands, and the new company has
never numbered more than fifteen shareholders. The company under
its first organisation received £28,600 in dividends, and up to
the 18th April last £138,885 under the new organisation,
including £18,834 received as grazing rents from surface lessees.
Thus we have an instance of a large sum (£148,651) being taken
from the miner which, upon the theory that the gold belongs to
the Crown, ought not to have been taken from him, and an instance
of a very successful speculation which has already paid for the
land more than four times over, and leaves still the estate
intact, barring, indeed, some surface damage here and there, and
the certainty of other mining royalties yet to accrue.</p>
<p>But the ability to pay such a large aggregate of royalty
proves the richness of the alluvium and the success of the mining
investors. Thus the dead Ristori Company (12,000 shares of £1)
obtained 104,224 oz. 10 dwt. 12 gr. of gold, value £430,918 16s.
4d.; paid £32,153 14s. 2d. in royalty, and divided £16 14s. 5½d.
per share. The dead Ristori West Company (20,000 shares of £1)
obtained 38,491 oz. 5 dwt. of gold, value £158,409 15s. 1d.; paid
£12,707 9s. 8d. in royalty, and £3 14s. 5½d. per 20,000th share
in dividends. The dead De Murska Company (8000 £2 shares)
obtained £76,600 1s. 2d. worth of gold, paid £5743 9s. 10d. in
royalty, and £28,200 in dividends upon £8800 called up. The dead
Lone Hand Company (12,000 shares of £1 10s.) obtained 126,146 oz.
3 dwt. 3 gr. of gold, value £522,162 17s. 3d.; paid in royalty
£39,163 1s. 3d., and in dividends £242,700, the paid up capital
being £15,300. But the still live and flourishing Madame Berry
Company (18,000 shares of £1 10s.) puts all the others into
shadow, for it has obtained already 160,592 oz, 11 dwt. of gold,
value £656,464 18s. 5d.; has paid in royalty £49,177 13s. 11d.,
and £21 8s. per share, or an aggregate of £385,200 in dividends,
with only 17s. odd paid up per share. This was up to the 18th
April last, and the company has apparently a long and prosperous
life still before it. This is the richest of all the Kingston
mines, and its works are extensive, as already (June 1887) there
have been over nine miles of drives excavated in auriferous wash,
a mile and a-half excavated in reef, or bed rock, and forty rises
put up from six to 157 feet in height, or an average of 30 feet
each. The West Loughlin and Berry Consols have not yet become
productive mines. The Hepburn Estate is in gold, the Berry No. 1
is beginning to open up wash, and it and the Consols will soon,
apparently, be productive, the Hepburn Estate and Berry No. 1
being liable to the same royalty rate as that in the claims
before catalogued, though outside the Seven Hills Estate. The
Lord Harry and Earl Beaconsfield mines are likely to be producing
gold before long, and a host of progressive companies stretch out
the line of ventures to the borders of the Loddon Valley.</p>
<p>Among the unpleasant mysteries of mining adventure the
discovery by the Hepburn Estate Company in the week ending the
12th February, 1887, that the officially reported details of work
done by the No. 4 diamond drill bore were a delusion was one of
the most unwelcome. As the drill was Government property and the
drill managers Government officers, the reports officially made
were regarded as trustworthy, and these reports declared that the
drill had drift at 414 fret, rising over 150 feet in the bore, at
417 feet was in quartz boulders, and reached bed rock at 420½
feet. This depth was enough to admit of the passage there of the
proved deep leads adjacent, and trusting in the report the
company spent £20,000 in the erection of powerful pumping and
winding plant and in sinking a large well-appointed shaft. The
shaft bottomed on gold, the company's future was regarded as
assured, and shares on the 27th January, 1886, sold as high as £9
10s., but when the drive for the supposed gutter, where the bore
was, reached the bore, and hard rock was found over head for 66
feet instead of deep gutter ground there was a panic, and on the
15th February 1887, shares fell to sales at £1 3s. 6d., a fall of
£199,800, rallying very little after that. A deputation from the
company to the Mining Department led to the nomination of Messrs.
C.W. Carr, P.M.; R.M. Serjeant, manager of the Band and Albion
Consols Company; and Stuart Murray, C.E., as a board to enquire
whether the reports of the bore operations were true or false,
and who, if anybody, was to blame for the company having been
deceived. The board began to sit in Ballarat on the 10th March
last, counsel assisting, and on the 12th the board found that the
evidence exonerated Harrison, the drill director, from all blame
of fraud, and ventured the opinion that it did not tend to lessen
public confidence in the drills, but the board reserved its
opinion on alleged errors in the drill reports. Directors,
miners, all sorts of people, lay under suspicion of fraudulently
dealing with the drill debris and drill reports for sharemarket
purposes, but there was no proof of anything of that kind, and
the material fact seemed to be that the haste and high pressure
with which the drill was worked converted the indurated sandstone
bed rock into its original drift constituents instead of drawing
up a proper core. In their final report to the Government the
board added to its previous findings the opinion that "in all
cases the cores representing the strata passed through should be
submitted to technical examination by skilled mineralogists, and
reported upon, before mining operations are commenced, and that
samples, with description of strata passed through, should be
preserved for reference."</p>
<p>Encouraged by the brilliant success on the Creswick side of
the Dividing Range, adventure was afresh stimulated on the
western side, where the old Sulky Gully leads sprawled out into
private property and were abandoned in the early sixties. A year
or two ago a company called the Dowling Forest Estate Company
leased from Sir W.J. Clarke 5,000 acres of his Dowling Forest
Estate for mining purposes, and a portion of the leasehold
between Mount Hollowback and the Dividing Range was sub-let to
the Dowling Forest No. 1 Company. This company has sunk a shaft,
opened up a considerable area of reef and gutter ground, and done
some puddling, by way of testing the value of the deposits, but
up to the present time no remunerative wash has been discovered
there. Mr. George Cornwell, of Melbourne, was chairman of the
original leasehold company, and his daughter, Alice, a lady of
much spirit and keen commercial enterprise, took great interest
in the fortunes of the newly opened field. Under her auspices the
Midas Company was formed, which took up ground a mile or two
south of the Dowling Forest No. 1 where some of the best known of
the Sulky Gully leads had been left. The Midas was in shallower
ground, by the end of 1886 had opened up rich wash, and up to the
present time (end of May) has won close on 2,000 ozs. of gold.
This success led to the floating of a host of other ventures
round about, from the ranges westward out among the rich basaltic
hills and plains of the Dowling Forest Estate. The diamond drill
was brought into play as an auxiliary, the work of prospecting is
going on vigorously, and it is hoped that a valuable new gold
field will be opened up to balance the rich discovery on the
Kingston side of the range.</p>
<p>Whilst these pages are going through the press the tide of a
revival of quartz mining on the Sebastopol plateau is flowing
Strong. This revival is due to the success of the <i>Star</i> of
the East Company, a relatively new venture, and the continued
good fortune of the Band and Albion Consols Company. Ten or a
dozen years ago, or more, the Guiding Star Company, in working
alluvial, had struck quartz that gave 1,300 ozs. of gold from
1,600 tons of quartz, but the company had to succumb to water and
other difficulties. Some good results thereafter obtained by the
Band and Albion Consols and Washington companies caused a rush,
and several claims were taken up south and north of those
companies, as there had been also as the outcome of the almost
synchronous Hurdsfield alluvial rush upon some rich alluvial wash
to the north-east of the Washington and east of the Kohi-noor
claims. The Star of the East claim was taken up and the company
registered in June, 1879, capital £34,000 of which £19,000 was
paid up. Gold was first obtained in September, 1886, and up to
the 3rd May last there had been 5,966 ozs. of gold won from 3,749
tons of quartz, and £4,800 paid in dividends. The claim is next
south of the Band and Albion Consols claim, and there are several
auriferous lodes in the area held by the company, including the
Consols and the Guiding Star lodes. This marked success, and the
prospect of equal luck north and south of the Star and the
Consols along the strike of the proved belt of lodes, led to a
fresh rush of adventurers, and claims were taken up for over a
mile both north and south, and companies floated to work them.
The favorite names for the new ventures were Star and Plateau,
and on these two notes a peal of changes was rung, and the Stock
Exchange share-list was much swollen by the added novelties.
There is thus promise of a good testing of the quartz resources
of the whole; reach of country from beyond Lake Wendouree, on the
north, to the Durham on the south&mdash;a tract of country that
was rich in alluvial deposits&mdash;and the reasonable inference
is that the quartz lodes traversing the same country, and which
were the matrices whence the stream gold was in large part drawn,
will prove remunerative in the working. Upon the success or
failure of this large experiment upon the Sebastopol plateau
depends, in great measure, the immediate future of mining in the
central division of the district</p>
<p>In attempting to show the aggregate produce of gold of this or
any other district in the colony, great difficulty is at once
encountered, and it is found that all figures must be merely
approximate. For several years nothing like statistics of gold
yields were attempted by the Government, and up to the present
day it is impossible to arrive at more than probable aggregates
and comparisons. The Mining Department has, all the years past,
been busy with letter writing and the receipt of gold statistics,
but has never found time or brains for distilling out district
totals. Amplitude of details, a very waste of figures, but no
informing or well differentiated total results. One thing,
however, at the date of the first edition of this work (1870),
amid all the dubiety of gold-fields statistics, had been
irrefragably established, namely, the superior auriferous wealth
of the Ballarat district over all the other mining districts of
Victoria. A few figures will illustrate this. The return for 1868
of the value of mining plant in the several districts gave the
following comparisons:&mdash;Ballarat, £706,393; Sandhurst,
£418,738; Beechworth, £283,445; Castlemaine, £277,248;
Maryborough, £227,348. The subjoined table of companies
registered in the Court of Mines up to the end of 1868
illustrated the metropolitan character of Ballarat in another
fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p>Subjoined is the tabular summary for 1869, issued by the

collapse in the late sixties told heavily upon the returns, but,

<p>The Victorian gold returns show that the year 1856 was the
culminating one, with a yield of 2,985,991 oz. From that year to
the year 1867 inclusive there was an annual decrease in the gold
yield, the product in 1866 being 1,479,194 oz., or less than half
the 1856 return. There was a recovery in 1868 of over 200,000
oz., or an increased produce worth nearly a million sterling. But
the tables for 1869 show a return to the decreasing scale. What
the whole colony did in the first ten years was shown by a
pyramid of gilded wood sent to the London Exhibition of 1862 by
Mr. J.G. Knight. This pyramid showed the size in mass of the
Victorian gold exported from the 1st October, 1851, to the 1st
October, 1861. It measured 1492½ cubic feet, and represented
26,162,432 oz., or 800 tons 17 cwt. 3 qr. 7 lb. of gold; value,
£104,649,728 sterling. In Hayter's Year Book the total export of
Victorian gold up to the end of 1885 is set down at 53,727,986
oz., value at £4 per ounce, £213,911,944. This shows the singular
rapidity with which the diggers discovered and worked the richer
deposits everywhere, since nearly as much gold was won in the
first ten years as in near a quarter century following
thereafter. For the last few years the returns have been falling.
Hayter gives the Victorian average from 1851 to 1885 inclusive at
1,535,000 oz. per year, or more than twice the 1885 total,
735,218 oz., as given by him. But the returns of the mining
registrars enable him to show that though the output has been
falling, there has been a rise in the proportion won to the
number of miners employed. His estimate of gold per miner is £104
4s. 4d. for the year 1883, £106 14s. 6¼d. for 1884, £108 15s.
9¼d. for 1885. But it has always been difficult to get at the
district yields very accurately.</p>

<p>In this table we have, in the absence of returns at hand,
assumed that Bendigo produced as much during the last four years
tabled as during the first four years, though it is known that
that field did not produce in equal ratio. Yet, after assuming in
her favor what is not true, we find that Ballarat stood half a
million ounces, or two millions of pounds sterling, a-head of the
northern field.</p>
<p>With the after years there came a change in the relations of
the two districts. The alluvial field in the Creswick division
has saved the Ballarat district from an ignominious decadence
beneath the position of its ancient rival, whose title to the
name of the Victorian Quartzopolis is unquestioned. The positions
of the two fields during the last few years is seen in the
following table, made up from the annual summaries of the

<p>The foregoing Ballarat totals are ascertained by the addition
of 10,000 oz. each year, for unreported gold, to the weekly
official returns of managers of companies. The Sandhurst totals
are taken from the <i>Age</i> correspondent's returns, but the
1886 total is, in the absence of a direct statement, made up by
taking 60,000 oz. from the previous year's return, the
correspondent saying "the returns for 1886 are from 50,000 to
70,000 oz. less than those of 1882-3-4-5." But to show how
Ballarat owes its relative position to the discovery in the
Creswick division, the following table of ascertained Ballarat
district alluvial and quartz returns may be glanced at, it being
remembered that the bulk of the alluvial gold is from the
Creswick-Kingston field:&mdash;</p>

<p>This table shows the recent decline in the general output from
the mines, and for the first time in local mining history,
exhibits an excess of quartz over alluvial gold. As in 1870, it
may now he said more emphatically, the future of the gold-fields
is, no doubt, to be one chiefly of quartz mining.</p>
<p>Mr. Westgarth, in his "Victoria in 1857", bears testimony to
the superior quality and yield of this field, and to the
enterprise of its miners. He says at page 182:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Ballarat gold for its purity excels the gold from any
other Australian field. Ballarat, indeed, takes the position
alike of the oldest gold-field of any note, and that which has
yielded the largest quantity of the precious metal. From the
month of September, 1851&mdash;when the Government first
established the armed escorts&mdash;to the end of 1856, there was
sent down from Ballarat by these conveyances no less than
2,801,729 ounces of gold, of the value, in consideration of its
purity, of upwards of £4 per ounce. It was at Ballarat where the
spirit of enterprise was most prevalent.</blockquote>
<p>The great purity of the Ballarat alluvial gold was early
discovered. It has always commanded the highest rates in the
bullion market. The assay of gold won from the Band of Hope and
Albion Consols mine for the half-year ending June, 1869, was 23
carats 2½ carat grains fine, and for the half-year ending
December, 1869, 23 carats 2&#8540; carat grains fine. Some assays
of nuggets show similar purity. The Welcome Nugget assay was
99.20 pure gold = 23 carats 3&#8539; carat grains fine. The Nil
Desperandum gave an assay 98.80 pure gold = 23 carats 2&#8542;
carat grains fine. Thus, whether in large lumps or small
particles, the gold found in the alluvium or drift of the ancient
water-courses, or on the banks of those water-courses, is
ascertained to be nearly free from all impurity, while gold in
the matrix, quartz, is always charged more heavily with the baser
elements.</p>
<p>As the origin of gold is still a mystery, unsolved by science
or experiment, each student has his own theory. Some hold that
gold is the product of electric action, some of vaporific
sublimation, others of precipitation. The modes of its
occurrence, the principle which governs its purity in and out of
the matrix, and other items in the arcana, remain nearly as they
were to the unlettered digger of the first days. Our most erudite
savans, indeed, can say but little more about gold than was
expressed by the old diggers, who pretended to no very clear
vision of the subject, and said&mdash;"All we can say is, that
where it is, there it is!"</p>
<p>In Smyth's "Gold-fields of Victoria", from which we have taken
some of the above assays, we find nearly all the particulars
tabulated below in relation to large Ballarat nuggets. We have
had to supply omissions and correct some errors in dates in
Smyth's tables:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="p236_table" id=
"p236_table"></a><img alt="" src="1304971h-images/p236_table.jpg"></p>
<p>"The Corner" is the name given to the place where the
sharebrokers and share jobbers assemble. For many years the
gathering has been in front of the Unicorn hotel, on the south
side of Sturt street, the brokers' offices being in the Unicorn
passage, or right-of-way, and in Bones' Buildings, next east from
the hotel. Bones' Building was originally a draper's shop, then a
mining exchange, and Bones has added to it a second story, made
one end into a billiard room, and retained most of the brokers'
offices. The name "Corner" arose from the fact that in the early
sixties, when the previously unorganised business of share
dealing began to assume regular form&mdash;Messrs. Stallard and
S. Goujon being of the earliest&mdash;share dealing offices were
opened at the south-east corner of Sturt and Lydiard streets,
where the London Chartered Bank now stands. The Corner at that
time was covered by a wooden building on posts, an ironmonger's
store occupied by A.R. Reid, now the actuary of the Geelong
Savings Bank. Michael Walsh was one of the earliest brokers to
open an office in the corner building, and he took in a partner
named Were, and E.C. Moore, who had been hospital secretary,
subsequently joined the firm. Other brokers followed, a daily
muster was established, and the foundation of the Ballarat Stock
Exchange was thus laid; the first Exchange, with M. Walsh
president, meeting in a wooden building erected over an old shaft
on the site now occupied by the Academy of Music. This was in the
sixties. After that the Mechanics' Institute and the Unicorn
hotel became the homes of the Exchange, and to Walsh succeeded
F.C. Downes, and to Downes succeeded W. Nixon, the several
secretaries being Messrs. Main, Slater, and Woolcott. On the 6th
July, 1881, a rival, called the Royal Exchange, with Edwin
Millard president, and S.W. Smythe secretary, was opened, the
members having seceded from the original Ballarat Exchange
because they declined to refuse to give individual quotations to
the press. On the 5th December, 1885, the Royal was merged in the
Ballarat, with Millard president and Woolcott secretary, both
still (June, 1887) holding their respective offices. There were
then 98 members on the roll, and the entrance fee by that time
had been raised from £5 5s. to £25, and the stock list including
108 mines, the bulk of which are in the Ballarat district. Whilst
this chapter is going through the press, the foundations of a new
stock exchange building are being laid in Lydiard street.</p>
<p>The Ballarat alluvial stocks were large and costly things in
the days of the origin of the share market. In the Melbourne
stock and share list of 23rd June, 1863, Great Extended shares
(80) were quoted at £2850, Kohinoor (40) at £2800, Albion (72) at
£1800, Prince of Wales (64) at £1750, Defiance (52) at £1250,
Working Miners (57) at £1100, Band of Hope (1600) £34. Thus we
have the Great Extended with an aggregate value of £225,000,
whilst at the time of this writing, May, 1887, the Band and
Albion Consols, whose stock is a purely quartz stock, covering
most of the areas held by the old Albion, Great Extended, and
Band of Hope alluvials, is quoted at 76s., giving an aggregate
value of £85,310. When the rich gutters were nearly worked out,
and the large original shares had got reduced to scrip, share
dealing became a larger and livelier business, and brokers and
jobbers multiplied, nearly all of them being, for the first few
years, men who had been actually engaged in mines as working or
sleeping shareholders. The business was accompanied by projection
of new ventures, and the occasionally violent alternations of
activity and depression which usually mark the course of share
dealing, for promoters of new schemes have to live, if they can,
by their craft, and the passion for scrip gambling provided an
ample arena for their exploits.</p>
<p>We have now ended our sketch of mining development, and the
instances cited show what a vast transition has taken place in
the miner's vocation since the days of the early shallow digging,
and even the deeper and richer digging of the days when the
Eureka, Canadian, and Gravel Pits were in their glory. The
immense outlay in labor and plant before gold is reached now
contrasts strangely with the easily won fortunes of the earlier
days. If the classical digger of the Eureka were here now he
might exclaim, "Oh! mihi præteritos referat si Jupiter annos;"
interpreting it auriferously to mean, "Oh! that the gods would
give us back the Jeweller's Shops and the Italians' holes of the
bygone days." And some yearn for even an earlier time than that.
For to an old goldfields man, weary with the hope deferred, and
the many losses of deep sinking, the memory of the first
diggings, or the sight of a little shallow-ground "rush" now, is
like a sweet vision of childhood coming back to bless the
world-worn old man in his desolateness and sadness of heart. The
shallow-ground days were blythe with rapid golden successes, the
joyous energy of independence and hope, and a continuous and
hilarious change; but now the mines are tilled with men who have
to plod on at their dull and ever dangerous routine year after
year upon a small wage, while capitalists win or lose upon their
market speculations or by the labors of the men who, in the
primitive days, would have scorned to call any man master.</p>

<div>H E town or city of Ballarat must be said to comprise the
borough of Sebastopol, as there is no break in the continuity of
streets actually built upon and inhabited. The latest municipal
baptisms have made Ballarat East to be the Town of Ballarat, and
Ballarat West to be the City of Ballarat. This ridiculous
nomenclature is a perpetual puzzle to strangers at a distance,
and well beseems the <i>morcellement</i> <a name="FNanchor_26"
id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#fn26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> of
local self-government, and the local jealousies and ambitions
which tax citizens for the maintenance of distinct halls,
offices, and officers, where one staff might better fulfil all
necessary municipal functions. This state of things is a survival
from the early days, when the western part of Ballarat was
nothing, and the eastern part was everything, save in municipal
matters, and the local interests that grew up on both sides of
the muddy little Yarrowee were kept alive in a more or less
absurdly belligerent form through all the foundation years of the
two Ballarats.</div>
<p>From the northern boundary of Ballarat West to the southern
boundary of Sebastopol borough the distance is five miles and a
quarter, and from the western boundary of Ballarat West to the
eastern boundary of Ballarat East the distance is four miles.
These distances are measured along the central thoroughfares,
where the whole alignment, with immaterial exceptions, is built
upon. Thus, starting from the eastern boundary at the Canadian
and going to the western boundary at Alfredton, the traveller
passes along Main, Bridge, and Sturt streets, and performs a
journey of a few hundred yards over four miles. This is a
distance as great, if not greater, than that in London from Hyde
Park Corner to the Bank, that from Westminster Bridge by water to
the Tower, or that from the Elephant and Castle, south of the
Thames, to Highbury Park in the north. It is as great as the
distance in Melbourne from the University to the Junction at St.
Kilda, or from the Spencer street railway terminus by way of the
streets to the junction of the Merri Creek with the Yarra Yarra
on the eastern boundary of Richmond. In starting from the
northern boundary of Lydiard street, and passing to the southern
boundary at Bonshaw, the traveller performs a journey of five
miles and a quarter, and traverses Lydiard, part of Armstrong,
Skipton, and Albert streets. This long stretch of street is
represented in London by the distance from Hyde Park Corner past
the Bank and Whitechapel to the Mile End road, from the Elephant
and Castle to the New River reservoirs, or from Westminster
Bridge by water, to Limehouse Reach. In Melbourne it is equal to
a walk from Flemington to St. Kilda, or by water from the mouth
of the Yarra Yarra to Richmond.</p>
<p>When the first edition of this work appeared in 1870, the
traveller, while traversing the Ballarat thoroughfares mentioned,
passed along the two central lines of streets of a city with over
40,000 inhabitants, 50 churches, 3 town-halls, 477 hotels, many
other large public edifices, over 10,000 dwellings, 84 miles of
made streets, 164 miles of footpaths, 15 miles of pitched
channelling, property of the rateable value of a quarter million
sterling, and yielding a yearly municipal revenue of £50,000,
exclusive of a water supply revenue of £15,000. He passed over
the two centres of a city comprising an area of 9400 acres in
extent, where lay 60 miles of water mains, 50 miles of gas mains,
and over 3000 lineal yards of stone flagging. He saw about him
long reaching lines of stately buildings, and elegant shops, and
large manufactories, including 11 banks, 8 iron foundries, 13
breweries and distilleries, 3 flour-mills, and other
manufactories, all within the town boundaries; while everywhere
around him, where less than twenty years before there was only
the wild solitude of the primeval forest, the works of mining
companies, the fertile farms, and the hum of commerce revealed at
once the secret of the power which had created this great
prosperity.</p>

<br>
Owing to the migration caused by mining changes, Ballarat has not
increased its population, though it has otherwise made large
progress. When this History first appeared, in 1870, the town and
district were suffering from a depression caused by the reckless
spirit of gambling at the Corner, by the responsive tastes of a
hopeful public, and by the natural operation of the progress of
mining, by which last the alluvial grounds had been in great part
exhausted. The large sums lavished upon mere paper claims, and
the heavy demands upon capital caused by a too great extension of
adventure, had so far prostrated the ability of the district that
a general collapse ensued, to the partial or total pecuniary ruin
of scores of families, and a very general depreciation of
property of all kinds, and notably of mining stock. In 28 mining
companies whose offices were in Ballarat, and whose mines were in
or near the town, the depreciation in the market value of
stock&mdash;comparing prices in July, 1869, with those in May,
1870, reached the sum of £1,042,000. At least another million
sterling must be added for depreciation in other stocks besides
the companies specified These calculations were furnished by a
gentleman familiar with the market, and they do not include the
losses in call-paying. In April, 1870, the Melbourne
<i>Leader</i> estimated the depreciation in 45 given companies'
stocks to be £1,016,000 in March, 1870&mdash;as compared to
March, 1869. The depreciation in mining stock, as cited above,
amounted to £2,042,000 sterling&mdash;a sum equal to two-thirds
of the annual public revenue of Victoria at that time. The
gravity of this fact, and the relation of mining to what is
called real property, will be seen from a comparison with some
estimates of municipal revenue and town property. The mining
depreciation was very nearly equal to fifty years purchase of the
total revenue of the boroughs of Ballarat West, Ballarat East,
and Sebastopol, and more than equal to eight years purchase of
the whole real property in the city at that date.
<p>This was a notable example of the ups and downs which the
city, as the centre of a mining district, has been subject to.
Similar conditions still exist and operate, though in a less
marked degree; and the tables of yearly assessments may be taken,
in some sort, as indications of the ebbing and flowing of civic
fortunes. In the interval since 1870, great urban and industrial
developments have taken place; new social and ecclesiastical
creations have added distinguishing features to the city; arts
and manufactures have grown in importance, albeit there may not
have been additions to the number of business firms. There are
fewer flour mills, breweries, distilleries, and hotels now than
at the earlier date; no additions have been made to the number of
churches in permanent materials, and some of the wooden ones have
disappeared; but additions have been made here and there to
churches existing in 1870, and in some places new churches have
taken the place of old ones. There are still eleven banks, not
including the Savings Bank; some metropolitan wholesale firms
have offices here; warehouses and factories exist now that were
not built in 1870; several manufactures are new, and others have
extended their boundaries, whilst municipal works have gone on
with ceaseless march whether revenues have risen or fallen. As
large mention of these several changes as space allows will be
made further on; but first we have to recount the beginnings and
expansions of local municipal institutions.</p>
<p>This large and populous city, whose area and population and
annual revenue would absorb those of several English cathedral
cities, is situated 50 miles west from the shores of the Port
Phillip Hay, and at an elevation of 1137 feet above the sea. Its
western half is spread over a basaltic table land, the foot of
whose eastern slopes is traversed by the Yarrowee Creek, which
for a part of its course is the boundary between Ballarat West
and East. Its eastern half is spread over schistose ranges and
made hills of the auriferous detritus, and includes the oldest
inhabited portions of the city. From it issued the leads or
gutters of golden drift which have been worked beneath the
elevated plateau of the western portion of the city.</p>
<p>The borough of Ballarat West, now called the City of Ballarat,
was the oldest of the three boroughs. It was constituted a
municipality on the 17th December, 1855, and on the 14th January,
1856, the first council was elected, consisting of Messrs. Jas.
Oddie, Robt. Muir, Jas. Stewart, M.D., Wm. Tulloch, Alex. Binney
Rankin, John Smith Carver, and Patrick Bolger. James Oddie was
the first chairman for 1856-7, and Joseph Combe was the first
town-clerk, and Samuel Baird first and only town-surveyor. Both
left office many years ago, and Richard Ford, now a railway
commissioner, succeeded J. Combe; the present clerk, George
Perry, succeeding Ford; works overseer Wood, on Baird's
retirement, acting as <i>quasi</i> surveyor.</p>
<p>The greater dignity of being a city instead of a borough
involved greater splendor of official appointments. Robes and
chains for the mayors, a gown for the clerk, and a livery suit
for the city hall caretaker, altogether a right brave display of
finery came into vogue with the civic eighties, to wit the robes
in May, 1879, and the chain in the mayoralty of 1884:-5. The city
clock was erected in the mayoralty of 1872-3. The following
official description of the mayoral chain of solid gold is a
municipal history in little:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Mayor's Chain.&mdash;At present 13 shields, with
connecting links and medallion. On face of medallion, the
corporate seal. On reverse side, "Ballarat proclaimed a
municipality December 18th, 1855"; "Council first met January
17th, 1856"; "proclaimed a borough October, 1863"; "proclaimed a
city September 9th, 1870." On face of each shield is monogram of
the chairman or mayor, and on reverse the following:&mdash;James
Oddie, chairman 1856-7; James Stewart, M.D., chairman 1858-9;
William Collard Smith, chairman 1860-1, mayor 1871-5; Robert
Lewis, chairman 1862, mayor 1863, 1871-2, 1880-1; Daniel Brophy,
mayor 1875-6; John Whiteman Gray, mayor 1877-8; John Noble
Wilson, mayor 1881-2: Fred. Moses Claxton, mayor 1872-3, 1876-7,
1882-3; John Hickman, mayor 1883-4: Alex. Thomson Morrison, mayor
1879-80, 1884-5; Charles Salter, mayor 1885-6; T.H. Thompson,
mayor 1886-7.</blockquote>
<p>Since the foregoing has been in type, new sartorial wonders,
<i>in posse</i>, <a name="FNanchor_27" id=
"FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#fn27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> have
been revealed, and the local journals tell of councillors, on the
suggestion (<i>congruenter nominatas</i>) <a name="FNanchor_28"
id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#fn28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> of
Councillor Little, being about to outshine the beadle. They are
to sit in "cut-away coats of aldermanic pattern, stand-up collar
in Prussian military style, and front and cuffs ornamented with
point lace; coat and trousers of broadcloth, and shoes with
silver buckles." The clerk's attire is acutely differentiated
from the rest, and the gorgeous caretaker's uniform remains
unabated.</p>
<p>The first council chambers were of wood, erected by Messrs.
Doane and Ringrove on the site of the District Police-court in
Sturt street, and were destroyed by fire. The erection of a new
town-hall with granite front, from a design by Mr. C.D. Cuthbert,
having been decided on, the foundation of the first portion was
laid by Mr. John Robinson Bailey, M.L.A. for Ballarat West, on
the 16th August, 1860. The builders were Messrs. Evans and
Barker, the contract being for £4,900, and the new building was
opened on the 1st February, 1861. The borough council afterwards
decided on a change of plan, and competitive designs were
obtained, and finally the council ordered that a design by Mr.
Lorenz be adopted, subject to variations to be designed by Mr.
Oakden, the borough architect, under whose superintendence the
present hall was erected. The initial letter at the beginning of
this chapter shows the upper portion of the centre and tower. The
contractor for the works was Mr. Cowland, for the sum of £16,767,
the contract to be completed by the end of 1870. On the 14th
January, 1870, Thomas Cowan, the mayor, laid the new memorial
stone of the town-hall. His worship in his address on that
occasion made the following statement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The Sturt street frontage will occupy a space of 153
feet. The principal entrance to the municipal offices, will be in
the centre under the tower, which will stand right out to the
front so that the stone which has just been laid will also be the
foundation stone of the tower. This tower is to carry the Alfred
Memorial Hells which have already arrived in Ballarat. They have
been cast by Messrs, Meats and Stainbank, of Whitechapel, and
competent judges have pronounced them to be the finest peal that
has come to these colonies. There are eight bells in all, pitched
in the key of E flat, and the largest&mdash;the tenor
bell&mdash;is 4 feet 3 inches in diameter, and weighs 23 cwt. The
total weight of the eight bells is nearly 4½ tons; the weight of
the eight bells in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne, being only
3½ tons. The Alfred Memorial Bells are valued at £1,180. In
addition to the bells, the tower will contain a splendid
illuminated clock, with four dials, each 9 feet in diameter, and
which, besides striking the hours and quarters, will ring a chime
every hour on fifteen small musical bells, that will be placed in
the roof of the tower. The centre of the clock face will be 95
feet above the street, and the total height of the tower about
135 feet. It is to be observed that the building now in progress
will leave nearly half the town-hall reserve unoccupied, the
depth of the ground being 132 feet, and the depth of the building
only 70 feet, so that if at any future time it should be decided
to erect a spacious public hall, there will be a site available
for the purpose of 120 feet by 70 feet.</blockquote>
<p>The hall was opened in due course, the Alfred bells were set
up in the tower, the illuminated clock is there also, but it does
not "ring a chime every hour on fifteen small musical bells," for
they were not musically audible, and their tiny tinkle was
mockingly compared to the jingle of bullock bells. Some bell
doctors essayed amendments in the carillons, as they were called,
but the essays were failures, and the little bells have been laid
aside. The Alfred bells are a success, and so is the ringing of
them sometimes, but the ringers are not always a happy family,
and then hitches occur in the bell service, whilst apprentice
hands occasionally make the evenings horrible with their sad
lessons in the art of campanology.</p>
<p>The first assessment was in 1856, and showed that there were
then 267 tenements within the municipality, and 297 vacant lots,
the whole valued at £40,061. On this assessment the council
struck a rate of sixpence in the pound, which the Government
disallowed, and a shilling rate was then struck. Among the
applications to the Government by the first council were requests
for a site for a mechanics' institute, for a market place, for
public gardens, for the removal of buildings where Sturt and
Lydiard streets now intersect, and for the formation of Sturt
street. Sturt street, which is now made throughout its whole
length, is three chains wide, and is ornamented with elegant
shops, churches, and gardens. All the other streets are one chain
and a-half wide. The borough comprises an area of 2,880 acres,
and has now property of the rateable value of £146,105.</p>

<p>Taking the city treasurer's figures for the year ending 30th
September, 1886, we have the city's financial condition thus set
down:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Indebtedness&mdash;Loan, 1875, £47,500; do., 1884,
£10,000; total, £57,500. Process of liquidation:&mdash;The whole
of the principal of the loan of £47,500 is repayable on 1st May,
1903. In the meantime, interest of 6 per cent. is payable
half-yearly, viz., on 1st May and 1st November; and 2 per cent.
of the loan is invested yearly towards the establishment of a
sinking fund for the liquidation of the original debt. The
principal of the £10,000 loan of 1884 is repayable at the rate of
£800 on 1st June in every year until 1893; the balance, £2,800,
becomes due on 1st June, 1894. In the meantime, interest of 5 per
cent. is payable half-yearly, viz., on 1st June and 1st December;
and 2 per cent. is invested yearly towards the establishment of a
sinking fund for the liquidation of the balance. Amount of
sinking fund to date, £12,628 0s. 1d.; debentures redeemed, loan
1884, £1,600; last assessment, £143,091; value in fee simple,
£1,787,910.</blockquote>
<p>The market inspectors supply the following returns:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The live stock that passed through the Corporation
Sale-yards for the year ending 31st July, 1886,
were:&mdash;Cattle, 18,950; calves, 2,252; sheep, 503,971; lambs,
62,045. Sales in the private yards for the same period
were:&mdash;Horses, 3,028; cattle, 7,420; sheep, 2,151; pigs,
14,077. The market returns for agricultural produce exhibit a
lively increase, notwithstanding the large quantity now taken
past by railway; but it is difficult to say whether the increase
is due to climate causes or increased local demand; in either
case it is satisfactory. The returns are:&mdash;Oats, 215,179
bushels; pease, 72,649 bushels; barley, 18,304 bushels; hay,
18,405 tons; straw, 1,251 tons; potatoes, 9,629

<p>The death-rate of the city for the ten years ending 1886 was
422 7-10ths per year, but this included hospital deaths of
patients from the whole district, and raised the average 25 per
cent.</p>
<p>Ballarat East was proclaimed a municipality on the 5th May,
1857, and on the 1st June, 1857, the first council was elected,
consisting of Messrs. Daniel Sweeney, John Gibbs, William M'Crea,
Richard Belford, William Bramwell Robinson, William Bickham
Rodier, and Geo. Clendinning, M.D. Mr. Rodier was chosen
chairman, and Mr. Jno. Campbell was appointed town clerk. The
municipality became a borough in October, 1863, and in August,
1872, a town. Following Mr. Rodier as chairman of the
municipality, there were Messrs. Richard Belford, 1858; William
Scott, 1859; George Clendinning, M.D., 1860; William Scott, 1861;
Charles Dyte, 1862; and Frederick Young, 1863. As in Ballarat
West, so here, the last chairman became the first mayor of the
borough. His successors were John Fussell, 1864; George
Clendinning, M.D., 1865; Emanuel Steinfeld, 1866 to 1869. Then
followed in order Edward Eastwood, 1870; James Ivey, 1871; J.K.
Baird, 1872; Henry Josephs, 1873; James Russell, 1874 and 1886-7;
James Long, 1875-6-8; David Turpie, 1877; William Scott, 1879 and
1885; William Robertson, 1880; Theophilus Williams, 1881; John
Ferguson, 1882-3; Thomas Walker, 1884. The municipal council held
its meetings in several rented houses during the earlier years of
its existence; but on the 26th December, 1861, the foundation
stone of the present town hall was laid by Mr. Charles Dyte, the
incoming mayor, with Masonic ceremonies. The architect was Mr.
C.D. Cuthbert, long since a resident in Fiji, and the builders
were Irving, Glover, and Co., the total cost being about £4,500.
The town includes an area of 4320 acres, and has rateable
property valued at £62,900. The first assessment on the books was
in 1860, when the number of dwellings was 2470, amount of
assessment not obtainable. The returns for the subsequent years
are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<span class="u">Sturt St Ballarat, 1887</span></p>
<br>
<p>There are within the town 40 miles of streets made and formed,
of which 20 miles are kerbed and channelled, and over 50 miles of
footpaths, of which 5 miles are asphalted, 17 churches, 7 State
schools, 79 hotels, over 3,000 dwellings, a town hall, a fire
brigade, candle, soap, clog, and other manufactories, a police
court, and a public library. Bridge, Main, and Humffray streets
are what in the first days were bullock tracks; the former street
is one of the busiest and handsomest in the city, and Victoria
street is as wide as Sturt street, and, like it, planted with
trees. Estimating the population of the borough at 4¼ to each
tenement, the total population is about 15,000.</p>
<p>The following statement by the town treasurer gives the
financial state of affairs at the dates mentioned:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Revenue for year ended 30th September, 1886, £10,901
14s. 10d.; expenditure for year ended 30th September, 1886,
£8,941 8s 1d.; indebtedness and process of liquidation (overdraft
to be liquidated under the provisions of "Municipal Indemnity
Act" before 30th September, 1888), £3,708 15s. 11d.; less amount
to credit of general account at 30th September, 1886, £330 8s.
7d.; leaving debt, £3,375 7s. 4d. Outstanding Loan&mdash;100
debentures, of £100 each, due in 1903, total, £10,000; bearing 5
per cent. interest per annum. To liquidate the said loan £300 is
yearly placed to a "sinking fund in liquidation of debentures",
bearing 6 per cent. interest.</blockquote>
<p>The death-rate of the town for the ten years ending 1886 was
212 3-10ths per cent. This average, and that for the city, are
calculated by Mr. Walker, the registrar.</p>
<p>The borough of Sebastopol was proclaimed in October, 1864, and
the first election of councillors took place on the 12th
December, 1864, when Messrs. F.F. Beverin, Thomas Dickinson, John
Edwards, Ricd. Miles, Ellis Richards, John C. Rowlands, Geo. C.
Robinson, Geo. Tait, and Isaac Vickers were elected. Mr. John
Wall, formerly of the Local Court, and a mining surveyor, was
appointed town clerk and surveyor, and still holds those offices.
The mayors of the borough have been Frederick F. Beverin, 1865-6;
Isaac Vickers, 1867; Thomas Dickinson, 1868-71; John Whittaker,
1869; John Edwards, 1870; John Morris, 1872; Thomas Bray, 1873;
Nicholas Kent, 1874; Peter Alroe, 1875; James Barrie, 1876;
Joseph H. Ellsworth, 1877-84-5; David Hughes, 1878-9; Thomas H.
Gray, 1880-1; James Leckie, 1882-3; William Hicks, 1886; Henry
Mathes, 1887. The first council sat on the 4th January, 1865. At
that time the population was 1800, and by 1870 had risen to 8200,
but has fallen to 2300 in 1887. The municipal census is taken by
the valuers under the Local Government Act, and Mr. Wall claims
to have been the suggester of the process. The average death-rate
of the borough, taking a term of 21 years, is given at only 10-5
per 1000. There are 40 miles of surveyed and 15 miles of made
streets, 2 miles of kerbed and channelled paths, and ½ mile of
asphalted paths. The area of the borough is 1800 acres. The
financial state of the borough is easy. Last year's £900 of
revenue was expended, but the council's indebtedness is only
£300, being balance of 10 debentures of £100 each unredeemed.
There are 8 licensed hotels in the borough. The following are the
assessments for the several years since the formation of the
borough:&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1886, Sandhurst, the next largest inland city after
Ballarat, had an assessment of £167,908, revenue £23,453, 7137
tenements, 84 miles of kerbed and channelled streets, 100 miles
planted with trees, 97 miles of road maintained and in use, and a
population, at 4¼ per tenement, of 30,332. Geelong, which ranks
next after Sandhurst, had at the same date an assessment of
£73,242, 2398 tenements, and 40 miles of kerbed and channelled
streets, and a population of about 10,200. But this does not
include the adjoining boroughs of Newtown and Chilwell, and
Geelong West, from which the author has been unable to obtain a
return in detail, but whose population nearly equals that of
Geelong proper.</p>
<p>In December, 1852, the first attempt was made at water supply.
The Government Camp authorities then here employed men to build a
small dam across the Gnarr Creek, at the spot where the creek
then ran, and where the buried culvert now hugs the hill on which
are the locomotive sheds. The little dam intercepted the overflow
from Yuille's Swamp and the Gnarr Creek drainage, and served
mainly for the Camp use. Yuille's Swamp, or, as it is now called,
Wendouree Lake, was for some years the only source of supply;
but, as the town grew, that reservoir was found to be
insufficient, and steps were taken to secure water reserves in
the Bullarook Forest, on which to construct reservoirs for the
permanent supply of the town. The boroughs of Ballarat West and
East united in a scheme of water supply, whose magnitude and
excellent organisation were unequalled in the colony, save by the
metropolitan supply. Mr. Richard Belford, when chairman of the
municipal council of Ballarat East, was one of the first
proposers of a supply of water from the forest, and owing to the
steps taken then, the question was at intervals agitated, until
the supply was carried out to its present limit. When Mr. J.B.
Humffray was Minister of Mines in 1861, Mr. Kirk, who owned the
first reservoir made in the forest for mining purposes, offered
the reservoir to the Government for the use of Ballarat, and Mr.
Humffray eventually promoted the purchase, and sent Mr. Engineer
Bagge to report on the repairs necessary. Subsequently, Mr.
Engineer Palmer, who became the first engineer for water supply,
was employed to survey the forest, with a view to the
construction of additional reservoirs for a more liberal
supply.</p>
<p>Before this, a commission for the whole town had been proposed
in a circular by the Eastern Council, but the proposition was not
then entertained, and when Mr. Palmer made his survey there were
grave doubts entertained as to the wisdom of adventuring upon the
larger scheme. Mr. Palmer held that the scheme was practicable,
and would pay, and he conferred with Mr. H.R. Nicholls, of the
<i>Ballarat Star</i>; who urged the adoption of the larger supply
upon the attention of Mr. C. Dyte, then chairman of the Eastern
Council. Mr. Dyte did not fall in with the representations made,
and Mr. W.C. Smith, of the Western Council, was then appealed to.
He was convinced by the arguments used, and he became one of the
earliest and ablest municipal advocates of the scheme of water
supply. Every year helps now to confirm the wisdom of those who
sought betimes to provide a good supply of this essential element
in urban health, wealth, and comfort. The borough councils having
had joint possession of Kirk's dam given to them in June, 1862,
pushed the business of supply with energy, procured loans of
money and grants of water-shed reserves from the Government,
until at length there were reserves secured to the extent of near
3000 acres, and when the first edition of this work appeared
there were three dams&mdash;Beale's, Pincott's, and
Kirk's&mdash;with an aggregate storage capacity of 294,000,000
gallons, 60 miles of mains, serving 5000 houses, 40
manufactories, and 16 mines, and producing an annual revenue of
£15,000. Then came a project for a fourth reservoir on the Gong
Gong Creek. At first it was proposed to erect a dam across the
narrow gorge where the granite outcrops a quarter mile or so
below the site of the present Gong Gong, but after a severe fight
in local councils and local journals, the present site was
adopted. At that time Mr. C.H.O. Bagge was the engineer, and Mr.
W. Thompson the secretary, for water supply, the borough councils
of East and West Ballarat being the committee or commission of
control, with a chairman chosen from one or other of the
councils, Mr. Andrew Anderson being for a long time chairman. He
acted with great energy and sagacity, and was one of the foremost
to promote the planting of the reserves with exotic and
indigenous trees. The Gong Gong reservoir, having a storage
capacity of 420,000,000 gallons, was constructed by Messrs. Young
and M'Guigan, from plans by Engineer Bagge, and a second line of
24 and 18-inch mains was laid to convey the water to Ballarat and
Lake Wendouree. Between the town boundary and the Gong Gong,
there is beside the roadway, where the mains are laid, a
"connecting house", where, by working a series of valves, either
the Gong Gong or the Kirk's line of mains can be shut off, or the
pressure in the Kirk's line be increased by turning into it the
water from the Gong Gong line. The first sod of the new reservoir
was turned on the 12th May, 1874, by Councillor M'Dowall,
chairman of the commission, and by October, 1877, the works were
so far completed that water was turned into the new mains. The
whole work was carried out under Mr. Bagge's supervision,
assisted by Mr. R.M. Gale, A.I.C.E., with Mr. W. Seeley as clerk
of works, the total cost of the new reservoir and valve house
being about £105,000, including costs of settlement of a law suit
between the contractors and the commissioners. The whole cost of
the water works was £362,000, and the revenue about £16,500 a
year, most of which is absorbed by interest on Government loans,
and in outlay for maintenance and management. At the end of 1886
there was due to the Government £313,457 10s. 10d, including
principal money £281,438 15s. 10d., bearing interest at 4½ per
cent., and arrears of interest, not bearing interest, £32,018
15s. The arrears had been £43,405, but when the present chairman
of commission (Mr. Wilson) took office, he obtained a remission
of the difference between the two amounts. The annual interest
now payable is £12,664 15s. 2d., and the sum of £86,808 17s. 3d.
has been paid in interest since the reorganisation of the
commission in 1880. The commission was then created by statute as
the Ballarat Water Commission, consisting of seven members, of
whom three, including the chairman, Mr. John Noble Wilson,
represent the Government, and are appointed every four years by
the Governor-in-Council, and two members are elected by and from
the City Council, and two by and from the Town Council, their
term of office being two years. The first meeting of the new
commission was held on the 21st July, 1880, the members being
J.N. Wilson, chairman. Councillors W. Scott and R. Lewis with him
representing the Government, and Councillors F.M. Claxton and
J.W. Gray from the City Council, and Councillors H. Josephs and
J. Phillips from the Town Council; Mr. J.B. Cathcart, who had
some time previously been appointed in place of Mr. Thompson,
being the secretary and treasurer. The commission has no engineer
now, but Mr. Cameron is the foreman of works. To Mr. Secretary
Cathcart the author is indebted for many of the foregoing
details, and for much information besides, unusable here for want
of space.</p>
<p>Lake Wendouree, the modern name of Yuille's Swamp, very truly
indicates by its name the transformation which has come over that
scene of one time alternate swamp and mud or dust hollow. By
conserving the water and pouring in additions from catchwater
drains and overflow from the forest reservoirs, a permanent lake
has been created, which has for some years now been the great
home of local aquatic sports and pleasure taking. It is the only
inland water resorted to for aquatic contests of any note, and
the beauty of its shores, the safe depths of its water, and the
large fleet of steam, sailing, and rowing boats at all times
available, have made the lake the favorite trysting place not
only of boating people but, during the summer season, of pic-nic
parties from nearly all parts of the colony. Since the early
sixties, when Bob McLaren and Ned Williams led the way in
boating, or Town-clerk Combe and Town-surveyor Baird pushed out
in a flat bottomed punt through the masses of reeds that then
covered the "swamp", the changes effected there have been many
and great. To-day the visitor sees a nearly cleared sheet of some
300 acres of water, jetties, boathouses, yachts, and boats in
profusion, and a fine fleet of steam pleasure boats plying from
shore to shore at fares within the reach of all kinds of pleasure
seekers. The City Council, with wise sagacity, has done much to
improve the shores, and the walks round the well-planted borders
are now among the pleasantest resorts of the pedestrian, who
always has, as a permanent, strong attraction to healthful
exercise, the botanic gardens as the western margin of the lake,
and on the lake itself a host of vessels going hither and thither
as may suit the fancy of private parties or the routine of the
steam companies and others plying for regular traffic.</p>
<p>The Ballarat Rowing Club was the first club formed in Ballarat
for regular aquatic exercises, some contests on Lake Burrumbeet
with both sailing and rowing craft having been the harbingers of
the safer and more convenient boating settlement and exercises at
Wendouree. We have not space here in which to detail the origins
of aquatic sports, but may say that Messrs. Cooper and Dobson, at
Burrumbeet, and the McLarens, Ned Williams, Ben. Oxlade, and
others in Ballarat, were the pioneers, closely followed by Ward,
Taylor, and others, still to be found about the shores of
Wendouree. From their initial doings have come the well appointed
clubs of to-day, the many well fought contests on local and other
waters, and the respectable position occupied by both the sailing
and rowing fraternities of Wendouree. The club was born on the
20th November, 1861, at McLaren's hotel. Bridge street, when it
was resolved to form a regatta club, under whose auspices a
regatta came off at Burrumbeet on the 31st January, 1862. The
club had for its first officers S.T. Clissold, president; J.W.
Pringle and C.W. Sherard, vice-presidents; W. Clarke, honorary
secretary; R. McLaren, starter and treasurer; and E. Williams, E.
Scrase, J.H. Harris, J. Ahrens, R. Davidson, H. Golightly, J.
Calder, J. Cummins, A.C. Kerr, and Cochrane, committeemen. The
club afterwards changed its name to the Ballarat Rowing Club, and
it now numbers about 100 members, and its present officers are
F.M. Claxton, president; R.W. Holmes and J. Shiels,
vice-presidents; F.W. Commons, captain; G. Read, vice-captain;
J.P. Moran, treasurer; C.J. Aikens, secretary; and E. Williams,
G. Tonner, P. Marxsen, L. Cutter, J. Pobjoy, J. Lonie, and R.
Ditchburn, committeemen. After the Ballarat club came the Alabama
in 1864. It lived for a year or two only, and after that came the
Wendouree, the Lebentia, the Ariel, and they all died after a
short existence. The City club was formed in 1871 and has a
members' roll of close on 100, its officers in February last
being D. Brophy, president; C. Salter, M. Cahill, and W.P.
Béchervaise, vice-presidents; E. Bailey, secretary; J.
Fitzgerald, treasurer; A. McNaughton, captain; J. Barnes,
vice-captain; and R. Toy, J. Byrne, W. Robertson, W. Trahar, A.
Kortlang, M.B. Jenkins, J. Aikens, J.J. Dobson, and R.A. Strachan
committeemen. In 1884 was formed the last of the rowing clubs so
far, and it revived the old name Wendouree. Its officers are J.
Hickman, president; Colonel W.C. Smith, and Messrs. McDonald and
Hartley, vice-presidents; J. Whitelaw, captain; C. Leggo,
vice-captain; G. Male, secretary; G. Miller, treasurer; and D.
Hare, J. McDonald, F. McGarey, J. Leggo, W. Archibald, O.
Liddiard, and E. Cutter, committeemen. The Wendouree also numbers
near 100 members.</p>
<p>The Ballarat Yacht Club was formed at a meeting held at Gill's
Lake View Hotel, on the 29th May, 1877. Mr. O.E. Edwards in the
chair. The following officers were elected for the first
year:&mdash;President, R. Le Poer (afterwards Judge) Trench;
commodore, O.E. Edwards; captain, G. Hathorn; treasurer, A.
Brown; secretary, A.T. Seal; judge, H.R. Caselli. The first
regatta under the auspices of the club was held on 30th November,
of that year, when prizes to the amount of £150 were given. The
principal yachts in commission at that time were&mdash;Victoria,
5 tons; Vagabond, 3½ tons; Endeavor, 3 tons; Telegraph, 3 tons;
Daphne, 5 tons; Kathleen, 3 tons; Leader, 6 tons; Flying Scud, 6
tons. On the 22nd October, 1878, A.T. Seal having resigned, W.
Downie was elected honorary secretary, in which office he still
(1887) remains. In 1881 E. Morey was elected commodore, which
position he still (1887) retains&mdash;the officers at this last
named period being&mdash;President, Hon. P. Russell;
vice-presidents, B. Hepburn and T. Bath and the Hons. D. Ham and
H. Gore; commodore, E. Morey; vice-commodore, W. Bailey; captain,
T. Bailey; treasurer, J. Murray, as successor to T. Mann on that
gentleman's retirement, after being in office for eight years;
secretary, W. Downie; judge, W. Gale (<i>vice</i> <a name=
"FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#fn29" class=
"fnanchor">[29]</a> H.R. Caselli, deceased); starter, W.P.
Béchervaise, who has occupied the position nearly ever since the
formation of the club; timekeeper, R.W. Holmes (<i>vice</i>
Lieut.-Colonel Sleep). The yachts in commission (1887)
are&mdash;Commodore E. Moray's Ballarat, 6 tons; Vice-Commodore
W. Bailey's Viola, 7 tons; E. Millard's Darlie Bay, 7 tons;
Messrs. Gill and Mann's Flying Scud, 6 tons; Alex. Monsbourgh's
Wendouree, 6 tons; T. Stoddart's Pinafore, 4 tons; R. Orr's
Reporter, 4 tons; R. Taylor's Victoria, 5 tons. There are besides
those named several other yachts on Lake Wendouree, which are
usually kept for cruising purposes, amongst them being the
Kathleen, Daphne, Endeavor, Idea, Coquette, Miranda, together
with a number of other sailing craft. The yachting season usually
commences in September and closes about April, during which
period, in addition to the annual regatta, club contests are held
almost every Saturday for trophies given by a number of liberal
patrons, on which occasions a steamboat is always provided by the
club for members, ladies, and guests. During the series of years
the club has been in existence, one or more of the Wendouree
fleet have represented the club on Lake Colac, Corio Bay, and
once on Hobson's Bay, and on every occasion with success, even to
the carrying off the first prize in each instance but one, thus
establishing a name and fame unequalled by any yachts of their
class in the colony. The members' roll at the commencement of the
season 1886-7 numbered 120, and this is expected to be largely
increased as the season progresses. For this concise summary of
the Wendouree sailing fleet the author is indebted to Mr. Downie,
the honorary secretary of the Yacht Club, and it is almost
exclusively given in his own words.<br></p>

<p>As regards the fleet of steam-boats on the lake, enterprise in
that direction began in 1865, when the Victoria, built by Messrs.
Bishop and Co., of the Soho Works of that day, was launched. The
Victoria has disappeared, and now there are six elegantly
appointed steamers plying upon the lake, the owners being Mr.
James Ivey and Mr. Gill. That is to say, Mr. Gill owns one, and
Mr. Ivey, who was the largest original owner, is now part
proprietor in, and is manager for, the Garden City Steam Boat
Company, whose blazon on the wharf notifies the reader of the
carrying capacity (690 souls) of the fleet.</p>
<p>Ballarat is rich in charitable and other public institutions.
The District Hospital, in Drummond street, corner of Sturt
street, an edifice in the classic style, is the earliest of the
public charities, sick and injured people having at first been
housed in huts at the Government Camp. The wounded men at the
Eureka Stockade could not be provided with proper accommodation,
and that led to the taking of steps for building a hospital.
Messrs. Lynn, Henry Foster (Superintendent of Police), W.B.
Rodier, J. Daly (Warden), R. Lewis, and others, mentioned as
among the first officers of the hospital, started the movement.
When the building was begun the site was in the bush, and some
people lost their way in returning to their homes in what is now
Ballarat East and the parts adjacent to Lydiard street. The
foundation stone of the first portion of the hospital was laid on
Christmas Day, 1855, by Mr. James Daly, police magistrate and
warden, the architect being Mr. J. Robertson. The foundation
stone of the remainder of the south wing was laid on New Year's
Day, 1866, by Mr. Henry Cuthbert, with Masonic honors, Mr.
Charles D. Cuthbert being the architect. The foundation of what
is intended to be the centre, or Alfred Memorial, was laid on
Queen Victoria's birthday, 1869, by Mr. Robert Lewis, and was
opened on the next anniversary of the day; Mr. J.H. Jones being
the architect, and of the completing north wing, not yet erected.
The edifice stands on a reserve of five acres on the highest part
of the western table-land. The names of the first committee of
management and of the first staff of officers are as
follow:&mdash;Messrs. J.A. Douglas, president; W.B. Robinson and
J. Oddie, vice-presidents; M. Elliott, J. Oddie, H. Foster, J.
Dixie, and A.B. Rankin, trustees; J. Dixie, treasurer; R. Muir,
R.B. Gibbs, W.C. Smith, C.H. Edwards, S. Irwin, J. Cummins, G.
Butchart, W. Moore, J. Daly, D. Oliver, J. M'Dowall, A.B. Rankin,
and M. Elliot, committeemen; T. Doyle, J. Stewart, R.J. Hobson,
and C.J. Kenworthy, honorary medical officers; H. Foster, hon.
secretary; T. Hillas, resident surgeon; J. Garrard, dispenser and
house steward; Mrs. Garrard, matron. The presidents since have
been Messrs. W.B. Robinson, 1857-8; A.L. Lynn, 1859-60; A. Drury,
1861-2-3-4; W.H. Foster, 1865; J.M. Strongman, 1866; R. Lewis,

1884; P. Papenhagen, 1885; A. Hunter, 1886. The resident surgeons
have been T. Hillas, 1856 to 1859; W.P. Whitcombe, 1860 to 1866;
R.J. Owen, 1867 to 1884; J.E. Moffatt, 1885 to 1886; W. Morrison
to end of 1886; R. Scott, 1887. The paid secretaries and
collectors conjointly have been E.C. Moore to 1863, and C.I.
Burrows from 1864 to the present time. G. Moore was at one time
employed as collector only. Omitting those already mentioned, the
following is the official list for 1886:&mdash;Vice-presidents,
D. Brophy, Alex. White; honorary treasurer, W. Eyres; honorary
solicitor, C Salter; committee of management, F.M. Claxton, P.
Papenhagen, T. Clegg, J.J. Göller, G. Smith, A. Anderson, S.L.

report then returning 1033 as the number of patients admitted in
the year 1869, and 5372 as the number of out-patients. Mr.
Burrows, to whose courtesy the author is indebted for the
statement, gives the present bed accommodation as 105 for males
and 43 for females; the male in-patients during 1886 as 634,
females 252, in all 886, and the out-patients as 1351 males, 1777
females, in all 3128. There are nine wards, including one for
convalescents. The total cost of buildings has been £25,022, and
the average cost per annum per patient £51 7s. 11¾d.</p>
<p>The Benevolent Asylum, on a five-acre reserve fronting Ascot
street, was the next of the public charities. It is a palace in
the Elizabethan style, with well-kept grounds, a magnificent home
such as the English poor, we may suppose, have never dreamt of in
their wildest flights of fancy. The foundation stone of the first
portion was laid on St. Patrick's Day, 1859, by F. Gell,
D.P.G.M., with Masonic honors, the architect being Mr.
Christopher Porter; builders, Messrs. Evans and Barker; cost,
£3765 4s. 2d. The first building was opened on the 20th February,
1860. The foundation stones of the subsequent portions appear to
have been laid without ceremony. Mr. J.A. Doane has been the
architect of all those portions of the asylum which have been
built since the first, save the chronic ward now building from
designs by James and Piper. The second portion was built by Mr.
J. Francis at a cost of £2907 15s., and was opened on the 10th
June, 1862. The third, or north centre portion, was built by Mr.
J. Hope, at a cost of £2016 8s., and was opened on the 26th
August, 1863. The fourth, or north wing portion, was built by Mr.
F. Nicholls, at a cost of £2127 1s. 5d., and was opened on the
19th March, 1867. The fifth, or southern wing&mdash;a lying-in
hospital&mdash;was built by Messrs. Irving, Glover, and Co., at a
cost of £2712 10s. 2d., and was opened on the 27th of July, 1869.
On the 29th April last. President Phillips and Treasurer Shoppee
laid the foundation stone of the chronic ward now in course of
erection. The total outlay for buildings and repairs up to the
30th October, 1886, was £22,216 8s. lid. The first committee sat
in 1857 as the almoners of the "Ballarat Visiting and Benevolent
Association", and consisted of Mr. R. Smith, president; the Revs.
P. Madden, J. Bickford, J. Potter, J. Strongman, G. Mackie, and
Niquet; Messrs. W.C. Smith, R. Belford, W. Fraser, R. Ocock, J.H.
Dunne, J. Oddie, M.J. Cummins, M'lvor, A. Dimant, D. Morris,
Martin, S. Donnelly, Tristram, A. Dewar, W. Dimsey, J. Dodds,
Crane, H. Wood, I. Wheeldon, R. Davidson, R. Lewis, Brannon, A.
Davies, Lockhart, Gripe, and Talbot, committeemen; A.S. Park,
hon. treasurer; A.A. Tarte, hon. secretary. The presidents of the
asylum since then have been:&mdash;R. Lewis, 1860-4; W. Scott,
1865; J. O'Meara, 1866; G. Lovitt, 1867; J.A. Doane, 1868; G.
Lovitt, 1869; J. Oddie, 1870; R. Wrigley, 1873-4; C.C. Shoppee,
1875-6; J. Long, 1877-8; J.J. Fitzgerald, 1879-80; H. Josephs,
1881; J. T. Phillips, 1882-3; J. Oddie, 1884-5; J. Phillips,
1886. Mr. and Mrs. Boughen were the first master and matron, and
Mr. Boughen is still in office, but Mrs. Boughen is dead, and the
present matron is Mrs. M.H. Phayer. Peter Cazaly was the first
paid secretary, and Dr. M'Farlane the first medical officer, and
to them have succeeded T.C. Coates as secretary, and Dr.
Holthouse as medical officer. The office-bearers for the year
ending July, 1887, were:&mdash;J. Phillips, president; J. Hickman
and J. Ferguson, vice-presidents; J.T. Phillips, J. Oddie, D.
Brophy, W. Dimsey, and A. Anderson, trustees; C C. Shoppee,
treasurer; Drs. Whitcombe, Usher, and Radcliffe, honorary medical
officers; H. Josephs, J. Showman, J. Russell, Rev. Father Doyle,
Hon. D. Ham, J.J. Fitzgerald, T. Taylor, S. Cohen, J. Curtis, D.
Lessels, J. M'Cafferty, M.C. Carey, W. Scott, G.K. Coutts, J.
Murray, O.E. Edwards, committeemen. The charity is a home for old
age and chronic invalids, and provides rations also for out-door
patients, the committee undertaking to visit out-door claimants
for relief, and generally to supervise the administration of the
funds. On the 6th December, 1869, there were 195 patients in the
house, and 816 patients were receiving out-door relief, the
outlay for the ten years from 1859 to 1868 having been £68,202
10s. 2d. At that time beds were made for 274 in-patients. On the
31st December, 1886, there were in the asylum 251
inmates&mdash;196 males and 55 females, the total admissions
during the year being 290 males and 114 females, exclusive of 14
males and 23 females born during the year in the Lying-in
Hospital. During that year there were issued 21,490 adult rations
and 13,836 children's rations to out-patients, or a weekly
average of 413 to adults and 266 to children; and the medical
officer treated 1690 cases&mdash;1373 males and 317 females. The
weekly average of in-patients for the year was 248, and the
average cost, calculated over the last eight years, per patient
per annum, was £17 15s. 10½d.</p>
<p>The District Orphan Asylum is in Victoria street, and is a
plain edifice, designed by Architect H.R. Caselli. It was
established in 1865, the licensed victuallers of Ballarat, with
Mr. W.R. Watson at their head, having been foremost in its
promotion, assisted very nobly from the first by the friendly
societies of the town and district. The foundation stone was laid
on the 8th December, 1865, by Mr. (now Sir James) M'Culloch, the
Chief Secretary of the colony, and the building, as far as then
erected, was opened on 8th July, 1866, the cost up to 1870 being
£7500. Since then large additions have been made to the asylum,
at once increasing the accommodation and completing the harmony
of the architectural design, the total cost to date being £18,538
3s. lid. In December, 1869, there were 80 children in the asylum,
the building then having accommodation for 200. The asylum can
now house 300 orphans, the number on the roll at the end of 1886
being 72 males, 49 females, in all 121. The asylum grounds
comprise an area of 40 acres, and the gardens supply the asylum
with a large amount of edibles, besides adding beauty to the
surroundings. In this later respect, the gardens of the hospital
and the Benevolent Asylum even excel those of the Orphan Asylum.
The following are the names of the first committee and
office-bearers:&mdash;President, W.R. Watson; vice-presidents, E.
Steinfeld, H.H. Peake; trustees of land, G. Lovitt, W.R. Watson,

Larkin; secretary and collector, Wm. Webster; superintendent,
John Finlay; matron, Catherine Finlay. After Mr. and Mrs. Finlay
came Mr. and Mrs. H.B. Sadlier, then Mr. R. Wreford and Mrs.
Wheeldon, and then the present Mr. and Mrs. A. Kenny. The names
of the present committee and office-bearers are as
follow:&mdash;President, J. Richards; vice-presidents, H.

<p>For both Orphan and Benevolent statistics, the author is
largely indebted to the present secretaries of those
charities.</p>
<p>The Female Refuge was originally in Grant street, but is now
in Dyte's parade, and is devoted to the shelter of several
classes of women in distress. There are now 12 inmates in the
house, and accommodation for 20 in all. The Refuge is under the
management of a committee of ladies. The present matron is Mrs.
Munro. The Grant Street Refuge was started some 20 years ago,
Mesdames Clendinning, Swift, Henderson, and Cummins being of the
first committee. The present committee are Mesdames Swift
(president), Thornton, Inglis, Clarke, Glenn (secretary), J.
Jones, Towl, W.T. Thompson, Corbould, R. and G. Thompson,
Williams, Thomas, W.H. Jones, and Trevor. The site in Dyte's
parade is the gift of Mr. James Oddie.</p>
<p>The Ladies' Benevolent Clothing Society is an auxiliary to the
larger charities, the main form of its benefactions being the
distribution of clothing to necessitous people who do not come
directly under the provisions of the Benevolent Asylum.</p>
<p>Ballarat is the See of two bishops, the Churches of Rome and
England having, in 1873, created each a Ballarat Diocese in what
had previously been the Diocese of Victoria. Although the Sees
were created at about the same time the Roman Catholic bishop was
first consecrated, the Right Rev. Michael O'Connor, D.D., having
been consecrated in Rome in May, 1874. He arrived in Ballarat on
the 18th December, 1874, and was installed in St. Patrick's
Cathedral on Sunday, the 20th, by Archbishop Gould, a sermon
being preached on the occasion by the Rev. W. Kelly, S.J. Bishop
O'Connor died on the 14th February, 1882, aged 52 years, and his
remains were buried in the north transept of the cathedral, A
mortuary chapel in his memory is to be built adjacent to the
cathedral. Dr. James Moore, who was dean and vicar-general under
Bishop O'Connor, had been entitled monsignor by the Pope, and had
previously been the senior clergyman in charge of the mission,
was appointed bishop in his place, and was consecrated by the
archbishop in St. Patrick's Cathedral on the 27th April, 1884,
the bishops of Hobart (Murphy), Adelaide (Reynolds), Goulburn
(Lanigan), and Armidale (Torregiani), assisting, and the Very
Rev. T. Cahill, S.J., preaching on the occasion.</p>
<p>The Right Rev. Samuel Thornton, D.D. (and M.A., of Melbourne),
and late Michal Fellow of Queen's College, Oxford, was
consecrated first Anglican bishop of Ballarat by the Archbishop
of Canterbury, and the bishops of London, Melbourne, and
Goulburn, in Westminster Abbey on the 1st May, 1875, S.S.
Phillip, and James' Day. Bishop Thornton arrived in Ballarat on
the 10th August, 1875, attended a thanksgiving service on the
same day at Christ Church pro-Cathedral, and was next day there
installed by the Ven. T.B.C. Stretch, archdeacon of Ballarat and
Hamilton, the bishop preaching the sermon. In the evening of the
same day there was a public reception in the hall of the
Mechanics' Institute, where attended the clergy. Chief Justice
Stawell, and other leading laymen of the church. On following
days addresses of welcome were presented to the bishop from the
Ballarat Presbytery and by a number of Birmingham men, from whose
town the bishop hailed.</p>
<p>The boundaries of the Anglican Diocese are officially
described to be those of the colony "except on the east where the
boundary is irregular, but adjoins roughly the 144th meridian."
The author has not succeeded in obtaining a definition of the
Roman Catholic Diocesan boundaries.</p>
<p>Of the many churches in Ballarat, those in permanent
materials, as brick and stone are called, may be particularised.
Every communion had earlier churches of wood, and at the present
time most communions have churches both of wood and of brick or
stone; but the more perishable buildings are gradually
disappearing as churches, and this record only refers in detail
to the more durable; edifices.</p>
<p>The Anglican communion has six churches in permanent
materials, of which Christ Church, in Lydiard street, is the
oldest of all existing permanent ecclesiastical edifices here. It
is a Gothic structure, built of basaltic stone, the nave designed
by Backhouse and Reynolds, and the transepts by Mr. E. James, and
was begun in 1854 during the incumbency of the Rev. J.R.
Thackeray, the foundation stone being laid by Archdeacon Stretch.
At that time the building was not carried on. In the year 1857
the nave was built, the Rev. John Potter being then the minister.
It was opened on the 13th September, 1857, by the Revs. P. Homan
and J.G. Russell. The transepts and chancel were added in 1868,
and were opened on the 6th May of that year. The transepts and
chancel cost £1,792, and the earlier portion over £2,000. A
wooden annex to the north transept has since been added for the
accommodation of the increasing congregation. The Church Assembly
having resolved upon the erection of a cathedral, arrangements
were made that the site should be that occupied by Christ Church,
which had already become the pro-Cathedral, but by a later
decision that scheme has been abandoned, and a site chosen at the
Dana street corner of the reserve, now occupied by the vicar's
residence. Designs for a cathedral were accepted from Messrs.
Tappin, Gilbert, and Denehy, and at a meeting in the Alfred Hall,
on the 10th September, 1886, presided over by his Excellency Sir
Henry Loch, the sum of £4,850 was promised in aid of the
erection. The style of the proposed edifice is to some extent
early English at a transition period, plan cruciform, with nave,
side aisles, transepts, side chapels for organ, choir, sacrarium
and vestry, accommodation for other church purposes to be made in
the basement. Nave length, 130 feet; width of nave and aisles, 64
feet; length of transepts, 120 feet; height of nave walls, 52
feet. The choir is an apse, and the bold west front rises sheer
from the street footpath, flanked by two towers, whose altitude
is about 200 feet. The nave roof is continued in an unbroken line
over the choir, and at the junction of the nave and transepts a
richly decorated fleche rises some 120 feet. The competition was
open to all Australia, and it is a matter of satisfaction that a
firm whose members are native born, one of them Ballarat born,
have carried off the honors. Altogether, the cathedral promises
to be one of the most beautiful of sacred edifices in any of the
colonies. The school-house of brick, which stands north of the
church, was opened on the 1st of October, 1868. St. Paul's, in
Humffray street, a Gothic design, built of brick, has been
re-built, in part, and was opened in its present state in April,
1864; architect, Mr. L. Terry. The original body of the church
was built for a school, the foundation stone being laid on the
17th of May, 1858, by Mr. J.B. Humffray, who then said it was
"the first stone foundation laid for educational purposes in
Ballarat East." The tower was built and the church enlarged in
1862, but in 1864 the site of the church subsided in consequence
of mining operations beneath and the building was taken down. The
present church was then erected, the Rev. R.T. Cummins incumbent,
the old tower remaining, and the church built west of the tower
instead of east as before. St. John's, a Gothic design, in
Armstrong street north, built of brick, and designed by Mr. L.
Terry, was begun on the 15th of March, 1864, the Dean of
Melbourne laying the foundation stone. It was opened on the 29th
of February, 1865, by the Rev. C.T. Perks. On the 16th of
November, 1869, Archdeacon Stretch laid the foundation stone of
additions to the church, which were opened on the 11th March,
1870, the Rev. G.W. Watson being the incumbent. On the 16th May,
1884, Bishop Thornton laid the memorial stone of a side aisle and
organ chamber, and the church was re-opened on the 2nd October of
that year, by Archdeacon Julius. The additions were designed by
Terry and Oakden, and cost £773 6s. St. Peter's, in Sturt street
west, Gothic design, built of basaltic stone, was begun on the
16th November, 1864, Mr. B.H. Hassell laying the foundation
stone. Mr. C.D. Cuthbert was the architect, and the nave was
opened on the 11th of June, 1865, the Rev. W.H. Adeney being the
incumbent. St. James', Little Bendigo, Gothic, built of brick,
and designed by H.R. Caselli, was opened by the Dean of Melbourne
on the 17th of July, 1864, the Rev. G.C. Allanby being the
incumbent. Holy Trinity, Albert street, Sebastopol, built of
brick, and designed by H.R. Caselli, was begun in September,
1867, Archdeacon Stretch laying the foundation stone. Since then
two bays and a chancel have been added, a memorial stone being
laid by Miss Kate Bray in January, 1870; the Rev. Gualter Soares,
minister.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholics have two churches&mdash;St. Patrick's,
Sturt street, now the Cathedral Church, and St. Alipius', in
Victoria street. The first is in Flamboyant Gothic style, and is
at present the largest and most beautiful Gothic edifice in the
town. The materials are basaltic stone, with freestone
enrichments. Bishop Gould laid the foundation stone of the nave
and side-aisles on the 7th of February, 1858, the Revs. P. Madden
and R.F.X. Fennelly being the resident ministers; architects,
Messrs. Shaw and Dowden. The pillars of the nave were erected in
1861, and the building, as far as the point now intersected by
the transepts, was opened by the same bishop on the 8th of
November, 1863, Dr. Shiel, Archdeacon of Ballarat (afterwards
Bishop of Adelaide) being then resident here. The transepts, side
chapels, chancel, and sacristy were built after drawings by Mr.
Denney, Dean Moore, now the bishop, being the clergyman in
charge. The erection of the tower and spire is reserved for the
future. The nave and aisles cost £12,000; the after contracts
amounted to a larger sum, and £1500 were spent on the iron fence
round the reserve, the total outlay to date being near £40,000.
Steps were taken in 1872 for the erection of St. Alipius', in
place of a weatherboard building previously in use on the site,
and the present edifice was opened in 1874. Archbishop Gould laid
the foundation stone early in 1873.</p>
<p>The Scottish Presbyterians have three churches. St. Andrew's,
in Sturt street, is a Norman design by C.D. Cuthbert, built in
basaltic stone, with an ornate freestone doorway. The foundation
stone was laid on 1st of December, 1862, by the Rev. W.
Henderson, the minister. While being built a portion of the walls
was blown down in a gale on the 3rd of August, 1863. The church
cost £3150, and was opened on the 15th of August, 1864. The tower
and spire were built in 1884 from designs by Architect C.D.
Figgis, at a cost of £2133, the height of the spire being 148
feet. The spire is named the Henderson Memorial Spire, the
minister having died during the building of it, and the dark
layers of stone in the pinnacles show the height to which the
work had reached on the 22nd July, when the pastor died. Two
small congregations had existed before the original St. Andrew's
one, which latter worshipped in a wooden building adjoining. The
two earlier ones belonged respectively to the Synod of Victoria
and the Free Presbyterian Church of Victoria. The remnants of
these two joined in one, making the St. Andrew's congregation
under the charge of the Rev. W. Henderson, the wooden church
being opened on the first Sunday in May, 1858. Soon after that
nearly all Presbyterian bodies in Victoria united as the
Presbyterian Church of Victoria, and the congregation of St.
Andrew's joined that union. Ebenezer, United Presbyterian, in
Armstrong street south, built of basaltic stone, and designed by
H.R. Caselli, was begun on the 10th of December, 1862, the
minister of the congregation at that time, the Rev. R.T. Walker,
laying the foundation stone. The church was opened on the 21st of
June, 1863. Some church additions and a manse have since then
been erected. Doveton Street Church, United Presbyterian, built
of brick in 1866, and opened in June of that year, was then a
Welsh Congregational Church, designed by Carpenters T. Lewis and
J. Thomas. It became the property of United Presbyterians, under
the pastoral charge of the Rev. R.T. Walker, who opened his
pastorate there on the 15th of August, 1869. The building has
long ceased to be a church, and is now a hall for secular uses.
The congregation of St. John's, Presbyterian Church of Victoria,
at first worshipping nearly opposite to the Synagogue, in Princes
street, and then in the Alfred Hall, accepted a design by Mr.
Oakden for the present large wooden church in Peel street, the
site not being suitable for heavier materials. This course was
taken on the advice of the architect, Mr. Percy Oakden, and the
present church, which holds over 1000 persons, and is said to be
the largest wooden church in Victoria, was built by Irving and
Clover, the site and building costing £3500. The edifice was
opened on Sunday, 13th August, 1871, when the Rev. Dr. Cameron,
and the resident minister, the Rev. J.W. Inglis, officiated. On
the 9th October, 1881, a Sunday school and lecture hall, at the
roar, was opened by the Rev. T. Hastie. The architects were
Caselli and Figgis; builder, W. Robertson; cost, about £1500;
holding capacity, from 900 to 1000.</p>
<p>The Free Church of England had one building, dedicated to St.
Thomas, built of brick, in Macarthur street west, designed by
J.R. Burns. It was opened on the 19th of July, 1869; minister,
the Rev. C.W. Collins, and is now a Wesleyan church.</p>
<p>The Catholic Apostolic Church has recently purchased, and now
occupies, the church in Sturt street west, originally known as
Holy Trinity Congregational Church.</p>
<p>The Welsh Presbyterians have one church. It is in Albert
street, Sebastopol, is built of basaltic stone, and was designed
by H.R. Caselli, the foundation stone being laid on the 3rd of
March, 1865, by Mary, wife of Ellis Richards, a deacon of the
church. The church was opened on the second Sunday in April,
1866, by the Revs. R.T. Walker and W. Henderson in the English
language, and on the next Sunday by the Revs. Messrs. W.M. Evans,
Farr, Roberts, and J. Evans in the Welsh language.</p>
<p>The United Welsh Protestant Church has a church of brick in
the reserve at the corner of Lydiard and Armstrong streets. It
was built in 1858 for the use of Welsh Protestants of all
denominations. The Revs. J. Farr and L. Llewellyn were the first
ordained ministers.</p>
<p>The Primitive Methodists have four churches&mdash;one of
brick, in Humffray street, the foundation stone of which was laid
by Mr. J. Richardson on the 9th of April, 1860. The church was
designed by J. Buckle, and was opened on the 8th of July, 1860.
One of brick, in Burnbank street, designed by W. Benson. Mr. J.
Richardson laid the foundation stone on the 6th of June, 1864,
and the building was opened on the 5th of August of the same
year. One at the south-east corner of Eyre and Lyons streets,
designed by J.A. Doane, and built of basaltic stone. Mrs. M.D.
Morgan laid the foundation stone on the 10th of May, 1868, and
the church was opened on the 23rd of October of that year. One of
brick, in Beverin street, Sebastopol, designed by J.A. Doane. The
foundation stone was laid on the 23rd of June, 1868, by the Rev.
S. Bracewell, and the church was opened on the 27th of the
following September.</p>
<p>The Wesleyans have eleven churches. Wesley Church, in Lydiard
street, built of basaltic stone, was designed by Backhouse and
Reynolds; cost, £5000. The foundation stone was laid by his
Excellency Sir Henry Barkly on the 17th January, 1858, and the
church was opened on the 18th of July of the same year, the first
sermon being preached by the Rev. D.J. Draper, who was drowned in
the "London" steamer, that foundered in the Bay of Biscay on the
11th January, 1866. The change of prices between 1854 and 1870 is
shown in the fact that £2500 was the cost of the original
school-house at the corner of Lydiard and Dana streets, a small,
plain, low-walled building of rotten sandstone from the Black
Hill, and basaltic boulders. A similar building could now be
erected for a fifth or sixth of the cost. The bluestone church
was sold a year or two ago to the School of Mines, and is now the
School Museum. The present handsome edifice, of brick and stone,
in pointed Gothic, at the corner of Dana street, is from designs
by Messrs. Terry and Oakden, of Melbourne, and was built by
Messrs. Irving and Glover, cost over £10,000, and will seat 1100
persons. The works were begun on the 5th October, 1883; the
memorial stone was laid by the Hon. J. Campbell on the 11th
December, 1883, and the church was opened on the 14th December,
1884, by the Rev. H. Bath, a former superintendent of the
circuit. Barkly Street Church, of brick, cost £1933, was
completed on the 5th of May, 1860; J.A. Doane, architect. There
was no ceremonial laying of the foundation stone. Neil Street
Church, of brick, cost £1400, was completed on the 16th of March,
1867; J.A. Doane, architect. The foundation stone was laid by the
Rev. W.L. Binks. Wendouree Church, of brick, cost £475, was
finished on the 16th of June, 1860; J.A. Doane, architect; the
Rev. J. Bickford the officiating minister. This building has
recently been closed, as subsidence of the site has made the
place unfit for use. Sebastopol Church, of stone, in Cheshunt
street; first part opened in March, 1864, completed on the 22nd
May, 1869; foundation stone laid in August, 1863, by the Rev. W.
Taylor, of California; J.A. Doane, architect; the Rev. J.S. Waugh

W.L. Binks; architect, J.A. Doane; completed on the 24th of June,
1867. In 1886, additions for choir purposes were made to this
church, after designs by Mr. C.D. Figgis. A handsome new
parsonage has also been erected close by the church. Golden Point
Church, of brick, cost £850; foundation stone laid by the Rev.
W.L. Binks; architect, J.A. Doane; completed on the 29th of June,
1867. Brown Hill Church, of brick, cost £714; foundation stone
laid by George Smith; architect, J.A. Doane; completed on the
22nd of March, 1869. The eleventh church is that in Macarthur
street, already mentioned.</p>
<p>The Bible Christians have four churches. Armstrong Street
Church, of brick; foundation stone laid in December, 1860, by
Mrs. Frederick Baker; opened on the 3rd of March, 1861; F.O.
Korn, architect. Skipton Street Church, of stone; foundation
stone laid on the 8th of August, 1865, by the Rev. John Orchard;
opened on the 25th of March, 1866; H.R. Caselli, architect. Grant
Street Church, of brick; foundation stone laid on the 19th of
December, 1865, by the Rev. W.H. Hooker; opened on the 18th of
March, 1866; designed by carpenter S.H. Lugg. Humffray Street
Church, of brick; foundation stone laid on the 30th of October,
1866, by the Rev. James Lowe; opened on the 20th of January,
1867; designed by carpenter S.H. Lugg.</p>
<p>The Hebrew Synagogue, in Princes street, of brick, cost £900,
was designed by T.B. Cameron. The foundation stone was laid on
the 25th of January, 1861, by Mr. C. Dyte, M.L.A., and the
opening service was celebrated on the 18th of the following
March, the Rev. Mr. Isaacs, minister.</p>
<p>The Baptist Church, of stone, in Dawson street, opposite to
St. Patrick's, a substantial edifice, with Grecian front, was
designed by J.A. Doane, and cost £3591. The foundation stone was
laid on the 23rd of October, 1866, by the Rev. Isaac New; pastor,
the Rev. W. Sutton, and the building was opened on the 6th of
November, 1867. Since then the building has been much beautified
both inside and out, and at considerable cost.</p>
<p>The old Congregational Church, of brick, near the corner of
Dawson and Mair streets, was designed for a school by J.A. Doane,
and cost £800, the site adjoining being reserved for a church.
The old building was opened on the 21st of March, 1862; the Rev.
Mr. Gosman, minister; after him the Rev. J.J. Halley. The first
church was of wood, in Sturt street, and opened on the 6th of
June, 1857. It was sold in September, 1861, to Mr. Boyd, the
printer, who still occupies all of the premises. In 1881, on the
Queen's Birthday, the memorial stone of the present church, at
the corner of Mair and Dawson streets, was laid by the Rev.
Joseph Walker, the pastor, to whom has succeeded Dr. Roseby,
whose pastorate began in December, 1885. The church is of brick,
in Gothic, with novel treatment in some details, the architects
being Caselli and Figgis, and the cost £3550. The present
accommodation is for 500 persons, site space being reserved for
future extension if necessary. The parsonage adjacent was
designed by C.D. Figgis, and cost £1400. The Dawson Street Church
is the only one belonging to this denomination in Ballarat.</p>
<p>The Disciples of Christ have a brick church in Dawson street,
built from a design by J.A. Doane; cost of building, £500;
fittings, vestry, and extras, £185; land, £75; total, £800;
opened in June, 1865. They have a wooden church also at the
corner of Peel and Eastwood streets.</p>
<p>The Friends have a small wooden meeting-house in Grant street.
The Wroeites once had a meeting-place in Dyte's parade, and the
Unitarians one in East street, but neither sect has one in
Ballarat at present.</p>
<p>The Lutherans have erected a brick church in place of an
earlier wooden one on their reserve in Doveton street south. The
architect was C.D. Figgis; builders, Taylor and Ellis; cost,
£1100 says Pastor Herlitz, but £995 2s., says the architect. The
church was opened on the 19th March, 1870, by Pastor Herlitz, the
head of the Lutheran Synod of Victoria.</p>
<p>The Town Mission was begun in an organised form in March,
1870, by Messrs. M. Morgan, Cortlet, Etchells, Jones, Nash, and
Costain, and Mesdames Kitchen, Whitrick, and Burton. In February,
1872, the present missioner, Martin Hosking, was engaged. There
is now a mission hall in Eureka street, and a Chinese school and
meeting-house in Main street, and the work done by the missioner
and his assistants in caring for the bodies as well as the souls
of the poor is veritably practical religion of a very Christian
type. Mr. W. Little, who, with Mrs. Little, gives valuable help
in the musical portion of the mission work, has furnished the
author with much interesting detail in connection with the
establishment and operations of the mission, but there is no
space available here for more than this bare and ineffectual
record. The author has only that poor but pressing apology to
offer to the churches generally for his meagre notices in these
pages.</p>
<p>That modern invention, the Salvation Army, opened its campaign
in Ballarat in April, 1882, the commanding officers being Major
(now Colonel) and Mrs. Barker, Captain (now Adjutant) Hodges,
Lieut. Hayes, Happy Dinah, and others; and a branch of the Prison
Gate Brigade was opened in August, 1885. An iron roofed wooden
barracks, measuring 90 x 50 x 12 feet, and accommodating 1,700
people, is erected in Little Bridge street, the memorial blocks
having been laid on the 2nd April, 1884, by the Hon. J. Campbell,
M.L.C., and Mr. Jas. Russell, M.L.A.</p>
<p>The passing of the Education Act of 1872 revolutionised the
primary school systems of the colony and annihilated at a stroke
all the denominational schools save some of the Roman Catholic
ones. That church has fought and still fights against the State
schools, and has opened new schools of its own in all directions,
but as the denomination is in a minority, and the great bulk of
the children of Ballarat are sent to State schools, these have
become a notable feature in civic architecture, as they are
necessarily numerous, and they mark the advent of a new school of
architecture in the Public Works Department. In the older days
the State buildings of all kinds were, as a rule, hideous to the
sight. The new State schools are sightly, and lend some really
welcome aspects to the landscape. There are eighteen State
schools in Ballarat, and there was an aggregate average
attendance during 1886 of 5,342 children. The aggregate cost of
the school buildings was £48,230, not including some outlay for
yards, and tree planting here and there. The following table
gives some details of interest, the names of head teachers, where
changes have occurred, being given in the order of their
appointment.</p>

<br>
<p>School No. 34 was the first Associated Training School in the
district. It was thus created in 1874, with Mr. Rosenblum as
associate. Seventy-one students have been trained there, of which
number sixty are now State school teachers. From school No. 1436
seventy two pupils have passed the matriculation examination of
the Melbourne University, and eleven have obtained from the
Education Department exhibitions of the yearly value of £35,
tenable for six years. On the 8th April, 1884, Mr. Nicholls, the
head teacher was elected by the teachers of the colony as their
first representative on the Committee of Classifiers. This
committee was created by the Public Service Act of 1883, for the
purpose of classifying all State schools and teachers, and for
dealing with the transfer of teachers. On the 4th May, 1887, Mr.
Nicholls was declared re-elected to the office by a majority of
462 over Mr. John Sergeant, the other candidate. School No. 2103
is the successor to the Denominational school in Errard street,
over which Mr. Lowther also presided, and to which between 5000
and 6000 scholars had been admitted. The number admitted to the
State school has been close on 4000. Under Mr. Lowther's
management many teachers have been trained, and "about sixteen"
have passed the matriculation examination, two have obtained
exhibitions, and four have won scholarships.</p>
<p>Church schools amongst Protestants now are Sunday schools
only, and as such do not seem to come within our purview here.
The private day schools are many, and their successes at
University examinations indicate a fair average of teaching
ability. The largest school is the Ballarat College, which is in
some sort attached to the Presbyterian Kirk of St. Andrew's. Its
first principal was R.O. M'Coy, and the present one is J.
Garbutt. A.A. Buley is now principal of Grenville College, which
was founded by John Victor. Victor has left Ballarat, and the
school has migrated to Sturt street. Bain's High School, in Camp
street, Queen's College, in Dana street, Mrs. Kennedy's School,
on Soldiers' Hill, both for girls, and Kearney's Ballarat Grammar
School, in Eyre street, are the other main private schools. The
Catholics have several primary and other educational
establishments. There are the Loretto Convent, Mary's Mount
(quaint misnomer for the flat marge of Wendouree), founded in
1875 by sisters from the parent house, Loretto Abbey,
Rathfarnham, County Dublin; the Loretto preparatory schools and
Ladies' College, Dawson street, conducted by the same sisterhood;
the training college, in the same grounds; the primary schools,
St. Josephs', Lyons street; St. Aloysius', Redan; the Sisters of
Mercy Convent schools, Victoria street; the Christian Brothers'
School, in Skipton street; and three primary schools for boys at
St. Alipius', Victoria street, Redan, and Palmer's Gully, under
lay teachers.</p>
<p>The Ballarat School of Mines, which has recently been
affiliated to the Melbourne University, was begotten in some
discussions between Messrs. J.M. Bickett, Harrie Wood, J. Lynch,
and a few others connected with the mining interest of the
district, Mr. Bickett at the first (1869) suggesting what has
only now been accomplished&mdash;to wit, the connection with the
University. Early in 1870 the project took shape, Judge Rogers
having drawn up a draft constitution for the School, and Mr.
Justice (Sir Redmond) Barry taking a lively interest in the
business. The Government gave for the use of the School the old
Court-house, in Lydiard Street, next north from the gaol, and all
the land and buildings between the gaol and the Wesley Church of
that day. On the 26th October, 1870, Mr. Justice Barry opened the
School with an inaugural address, and as the School developed,
more buildings were erected, including classrooms, laboratory,
lecture-hall, steam-gauge testing tower. On the 8th October,
1885, the Wesley Church of 1870, which had in the interim been
purchased by the School authorities, was opened by his Excellency
Sir H.B. Loch as a museum free to the public. The whole property
of the School is valued at about £15,000, including the site, an
insurance for £10,350 covering the buildings and their contents.
An annual vote in aid of Schools of Mines is passed by the
Legislature, the Ballarat School receiving half, as since 1880,
inclusive, the ordinary annual vote has been £4,000, and has been
equally divided between the Ballarat and Sandhurst Schools. The
School is governed by a council meeting quarterly, and an
administrative council meeting monthly. The first president of
the School was Mr. Justice Barry. The other members of the first
council were&mdash;Judge Rogers (vice-president), Sir J.
M'Culloch, J.A. M'Pherson, D. Gillies and W. M'Lellan, M's.L.A.,
Professor M'Coy, Messrs. II. Wood, J.M. Bickett, H.B. de la Poer
Wall, Dr. Usher, T. Gray, U.W. Newman, R. Lewis, J. M'Dowall,
H.R. Caselli, VI. Trennery, L.S. Christie, C.S. Reeves, R.M.
Sergeant, T.D. Wanliss, and the chairmen of the mining boards of
the colony at that date. The first secretary was James Baker, of
frontage regulations fame; then J. Croker, then W.H. Barnard, as
a methodically enthusiastic first registrar, then the present
registrar. The museum, which is open free to the public, is a
growing attraction, and very rich in mineralogical exhibits. In
February last, Mr. R.M. Sergeant deposited £260 in the City of
Melbourne Bank as a premium for the best method, other than the
smelting mode, of treating auriferous ores. The offer was to
remain open for two years, and if not then won, the money was to
be applied to the founding of a School of Mines scholarship for
engineering; the mayors of Ballarat, the vice-president of the
School of Mines, and the chairman of the Band and Albion Consols
Company are the trustees. This offer has greater moment from the
fact that from several colonies, even as far off as the Kimberley
gold fields, in South Africa, applications have been sent to the
School for help in the supply of mine managers, engineers, and
persons skilled in the treatment of refractory ores. Want of
space shuts out a mass of details of interest relative to the
School and Museum, and this notice must close with list of
council and officers at the close of 1886:&mdash;President, Sir
Wm. Foster Stawell; vice-president, James Oddie; trustees. Sir
W.J. Clarke, Bart., M.L.C., R.H. Bland, J.W. Rogers, Q.C.;
council, the president, the vice president, D. Gillies, M.L.A.,
W. M'Lellan, M.L.A., F. M'Coy, F.G.S., Prof. Univ. of Melbourne,
J.W. Rogers, Q.C., the Anglican Bishop of Ballarat, C.R. Blackett
(the president of the Pharmacy Board, Victoria), A. Anderson,
J.M. Bickett, I.J. Jones, Archdeacon Churchill Julius, J. Lonie,
J.F. Martell, W.H. Nicholls, H. Reid, E.I. Rosenblum, R.T. Vale,
M.L.A., Theos. Williams, A. Wynne, the Mayor of the City of
Ballarat, the Mayor of the Town of Ballarat East, and the
chairman, for the time being, of each of the seven mining boards
of Victoria; honorary solicitor, H. Cuthbert; honorary treasurer,
I.J. Jones; curator of museum, F.M. Krause, F.G.S.; botanical
reserve, hon. curator, W. Longley; auditor, Chas. Kent;
registrar, Andw. Berry.</p>
<p>The School of Mines Observatory, which was begun on the 16th
December, 1885, is situated near the south boundary of the Town
of Ballarat East, on a moderately elevated spur of the White
Horse Ranges, known as Mount Pleasant. In 1885 the Government
reserved three acres on this site, selected by Mr. J. Wall, for
observatory purposes, and in March, 1886, the Anglican Bishop of
Ballarat, Mr. Ellery, Mr. James Oddie, Mr. Isaac J. Jones, Mr.
Theophilus Williams, Mr. Rosenblum, and Mr. Agar Wynne were
appointed a committee under the provisions of the Land Act 1884
for the care, protection, and management of the reserve. Mr.
James Oddie, with a generous zeal for the promotion of
astronomical science, supplied the means by which the Observatory
buildings have been erected and equipped. The first telescope
placed in position was a 12½-inch Newtonian reflector, made by
Captain H.E. Baker, late of Goldsborough, now residing at the
Observatory. This instrument was turned to the heavens for the
first time on the 13th January, 1886. On the 11th May, 1886, the
formal opening took place, when Mr. D.M. Davies, M.L.A., occupied
the chair. The Hon. W.C. Smith, M.L.A., introduced Master
M'Hutchinson, who, on behalf of the students of the astronomical
class, read an address to Mr. Oddie, the conclusion of which was
a request that he would permit the "lighthouse of the sky to be
named the Oddie Observatory." Mr. Oddie, in reply, expressed the
hope that the Observatory would prove a valuable adjunct to the
School of Mines, and that the establishment would ultimately be
taken over by the council of that institution. This is probably
the destiny of the Observatory.</p>
<p>Ballarat is the first provincial city in Australia to possess
an art gallery open free to the public. The gallery is the
outcome of an exhibition in June, 1884, of local and other
pictures in the city hall. The expenses of that display, £200,
were borne by Mr. James Oddie, and he and Messrs. T. Price, J.
Oldham, E. Turnbull, C.N. Gilbert, and H.J. Hall were the
original promoters of the exhibition. A meeting of citizens
decided that a permanent gallery of art should be established;
the front floor of the Academy of Music was rented at a nominal
rate from Sir W.J. Clarke, and his Excellency the Governor opened
the gallery on the 11th of September of the same year, his
Excellency and Lady Loch being then on their first visit to
Ballarat. Mr. Turnbull acted as secretary. The gallery was nearly
filled "with loaned pictures, and in course of time many
presentations of works by Australian and other artists were made,
Mr. Oddie being specially liberal in his donations both of money
and pictures. To Mr. Turnbull succeeded the present secretary,
Mr. J.A. Powell. In August, 1886, the Government sanctioned a
vote of £2000 for the purchase of pictures, and granted a site of
21 perches in Lydiard street for a gallery, designs for which, by
Tappin, Gilbert, and Denehy, were adopted by the gallery
committee, who decided on erecting the front part of the
building. Last May the patrons of the gallery were incorporated
as the Ballarat Fine Art Public Gallery
Association&mdash;President, J. Oddie; vice-presidents, Right
Rev. Dr. Thornton, Right Rev. Monsignor Moore, Sir W.J. Clarke,
Bart., T. Stoddart, J. Shiels; executive committee, the
vice-presidents, and Archdeacon Julius, Father Rogers, J. Oldham,
E. Morey, F. Martell, J. Robson, G. Perry, T. Bath, C.B.
Retallack; council, members of the executive, and Rev. Dr.
Roseby, Dr. Maconnochie, A. Anderson, D. Brophy, J. Coghlan, J.
Hickman, H.J. Hall, J. Holland, F.W. Niven, W.H. Nicholls, T.
Price, J. Sommers, C Schutze, A. Wynne, R. Wrigley, T. Uthwatt;
hon. treasurer, J. Oddie; hon. solicitor, A. Wynne; Melbourne
selection committee, G.F. Follingsby, J. Smith, L. Patterson, J.
Reed; local selection and hanging committee, H.J. Hall, J.
Oldham, J. Sommers, T. Price. On the 21st June, the Queen's
Jubilee Day, the memorial stone of the gallery was laid by Sir
W.J. Clarke. The architects' description of the building is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The Art Gallery has a frontage of 58 feet, with a
depth of 100 feet. At present it is intended to only build a
portion, viz., the façade complete, with a depth of 77 feet. The
ground plan is divided into two large shops, placed one on each
side of a grand entrance 13 feet wide, which leads to a double
flight of stone steps, each 6 feet 6 inches wide. Behind the
staircase is the secretary's office and students' rooms. The
first floor is merely two large rooms, lit from the ceilings, the
main gallery being 55 feet long, 35 feet wide, and 24 feet high;
the back or water color gallery being 55 x 20 x 20. The whole of
the building is fire proof, and ventilated in accordance with the
Tobin principle. The front, which is 50 feet high, is divided
into three bays by three-quarters round Corinthian columns,
relieved by pediments, and crowned by the figure of Britannia,
supported by figures representing arts and science. The basement
will be in the Doric order, the columns being rusticated.
Material of basement, bluestone; rest of front, brick and cement.
The shops may at future date be converted into students' rooms.
Total cost of present portion, £500.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Thomas Stoddart, a wealthy mining speculator of relined
tastes and liberal ideas, has given to Ballarat possession of an
art gift unique in all Australasia. None of the public grounds of
even the metropolitan cities of Australia are graced with marble
statues in such profusion as are the Botanic Gardens of Ballarat,
and this distinction is due to the large liberality of Mr.
Stoddart. When in Italy a few years since, he remembered
Ballarat, and resolved to embellish it with no fewer than twelve
statues in Carrara marble from divers studios in that place, and
on the Queen's Birthday, 1884, he formally handed over his
splendid present to the mayor and council of the city, as
custodians for the city for all time, the statues being at that
time set up in the Gardens. A procession of boats across the
lake, a large concourse of spectators, the presence of the
Ballarat Rangers with their band, all lent interest to the
occasion, and the spontaneous applause of the people who
witnessed the ceremony of the transfer betokened the public
appreciation of the generosity of the giver. The statues
represent Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Hercules, Mercury,
Leda, a Bacchante, the Farnese, and another Flora, Hebe, and
Pomona.</p>
<p>James Russell Thompson's name occurs in the early passages of
this book. He was a very true gentleman, well informed, studious,
generous, modest. From the early fifties to the early eighties he
was, with brief exceptional absence, a citizen bearing a quiet
retired part in the building up of this city and its interests.
He died on the 26th May, 1886, and by his will he bequeathed a
landscape, a portrait, and a study of dogs' heads, all in oil, to
the Ballarat Art Gallery, besides a residuary bequest amounting
to £3000 in trust to his executors, Messrs. J. Noble Wilson and
H.A. Nevett, for the purchase of statuary for the Botanic
Gardens, Mr. Stoddart being requested by the testator to assist
the executors in selecting the works of art to be chosen. These
gentlemen have been in communication with the Hon. James Service,
who is travelling in Europe, and he has provisionally advised the
purchase; of a marble group in Rome, representing the flight of a
man, woman, and child from Pompeii. The executors and Mr.
Stoddart have also under consideration the selection of another
work, probably either a statue of Wallace, the Scottish hero, or
the symbolical group Britannia unveiling Australia; but at the
time of this writing (June, 1887), no selection has been made
absolutely.</p>
<p>The statue of Robert Burns, erected in Sturt street opposite
to the General Post-office, is the gift of a body of citizen
subscribers, and this ornament to the city may fairly be regarded
as a first fruit of the example given in the Stoddart
presentation to the city. The statue is by Giovanni Udney, of
Carrara, from a design by Mr. Thomas Thompson, of Ballarat, and a
portrait of the poet sent to the artist for his inspiration. The
work was unveiled on the Eight Hours Anniversary Day, 1887, by
the Hon. J. Nimmo, Minister of Public Works, who made an oration
on the occasion in the presence of ten or fifteen thousand
holiday sight-seers. Mr. Stoddart was one of the more active of
the committee, and a banquet was given to him on the 10th June,
1887, on which occasion a gold watch was presented to Mr. J.M.
Bickett, who had acted as secretary to the committee. The cost of
the statue and its belongings was over £800.</p>
<p>The seminal influence of good deeds is seen again in a
movement already forward for the erection of a statue of Tom
Moore. As was the case with the Burns statue, so now, as these
words are being written, all sorts of people are joining in the
endeavor for the honor of Moore of the "Melodies". The
committeemen have applied to the City Council for leave to erect
the statue in Sturt street, immediately west of Armstrong street,
where the Queen's Birthday Oak at present stands, and the council
has referred the matter to the Lake and Gardens Committee. The
council itself has also under consideration a project of its own
for the city, namely the erection of a statue of the Queen in
Sturt street, opposite to the city hall, and in commemoration of
Her Majesty's Jubilee.</p>
<p>Typography was almost as early an art in Ballarat as was that
of the blacksmith, for the diggers had not been long here before
the printers were at work. The first attempt, as we have seen in
an earlier chapter, to get a press conveyed to Ballarat failed,
and the first office actually opened appears to have been
Seekamp's <i>Ballarat Times</i> office, in Mair street, Ballarat
West. He afterwards migrated to Bakery Hill in the East. After
him came Fletcher and Evans, in the old Main road, now called
Bridge street, but before the old levels were raised to what they
are now, with some of the shop floors in the present street
eleven feet above the original surface. Fletcher was one of those
arrested for the burning of Bentley's hotel. His office was the
first jobbing office apart from the newspaper press, and
Wheeler's <i>Trumpeter</i> was printed there. This office became
the printing and bookbinding establishment for some years of
Armstrong, who, in 1853, introduced at Golden Point the first
Ballarat circulating library. Charles Boyd, who is still here,
began business as a printer in the Main road, near the United
States hotel in 1857, and he claims to have first introduced
Greek letter type in Ballarat. That was in 1862, the type being
specially imported from England for his use. It was employed for
some years by Mr. J.H. Pope, then head teacher of the Soldiers'
Hill Presbyterian school, for printing examination papers. The
letter is seldom used now here, and, indeed, is not kept in any
other office but Boyd's. Like gold digging and the several
sports, printing was first started in the east&mdash;if Clarke's
foiled essay in 1851 may be called a start&mdash;but it has long
since made the west its head quarters. Excepting M'Kee's printing
office in Bridge street, all the offices now are in the west,
namely, the newspaper offices, and the jobbing offices, large and
small&mdash;to wit, Boyd's, in Sturt street; J. Curtis' and J.
Anderson and Co.'s, in Armstrong street; F. Pinkerton's, E.
Campbell's, J. M'Hutchison's, Rider and Mercer's, in Lydiard
street; and the publishers of this book, in Sturt street. F.W.
Niven and Co.'s business is the largest in Ballarat, and the
largest in the colony outside the metropolis. A <i>Courier</i>
report of a visit to the establishment on the 10th of November
last states that "during the past few years the firm has brought
into use £1500 worth of the newest machinery, and their excellent
work in printing and chromo-lithography has enabled them to
largely increase their business." The visit was made to view
exhibits prepared for the exhibition then about to be opened at
Sandhurst, and the scene presented by the busy working of
sixty-five hands, with engines, presses, and so forth, and the
prolific output of pictures, posters, cards, labels, scrip,
crests, monograms, almanacs, and what not, besides engravers and
lithographers at their nicer and noiseless work, was a display to
remember. The magnitude of the firm's operations is reflected in
the average weekly wage sheet of £111, the £5000 worth of
machinery in use, and the annual consumption for the year of
£6500 worth of paper and printing, bookbinding, and stationery
materials. This edition of the History of Ballarat, comprising
10,200 copies, when bound complete, will have absorbed 256 reams
of paper, and will weigh no less than 6½ tons. Inspired by the
<i>Courier</i> reporter, the author notes that at a banquet on
the same day, at Craig's hotel, Mr. Niven, the senior partner,
referred to Seekamp and the first printers, and the improvements
now in vogue whereby "millions of bills, &amp;c., could be turned
out in the same time as about 100 were printed with the old hand
arrangement." The <i>Star</i> reporter lets in the following ray
of light upon the development of the firm's business:&mdash;"Four
and a half years ago, we understand, the firm employed 20 hands.
At that time they devoted their attention almost solely to mining
and ordinary letter-press printing. Since Mr. H.W.H. Irvine
joined the firm, however, and relieved Mr. Niven of the
management of the commercial part of the business, enabling him
to devote his attention more fully to the artistic work, the
firm's trade has increased by leaps and bounds, until now there
are 65 or 67 hands employed." This firm supplies orders all over
Victoria, and in parts of adjacent colonies, and for its exhibits
at the Sandhurst Exhibition a silver medal was awarded.</p>
<p>Photography was a very early form of localised pictorial art
in Ballarat, that is if photography be an art, a question which
is left for experts to discuss. William Ellis was the first
Ballarat photographer. He was a bricklayer, who had emigrated
from Liverpool to Port Natal, crossed over to Victoria in 1853,
worked at his trade in Melbourne, picked up the rudiments of
photography there, and settled on the Red Hill, Ballarat, in
1855. In December, 1855, a daguerreotypist named Rochlitz had a
"studio" near the Golden Fleece hotel, Lydiard street. His place
was a two storied wooden house on the site now occupied by
offices of the Ballarat Banking Company. Messrs. Cowley and J.
Noble Wilson subsequently practised photography there, with
Rochlitz as assistant. About that time, or a few months later,
when Lola Montes was in Ballarat, an American daguerreotypist
practised a little while, and issued some rather free and easy
photographs of the famous strolling player of so many
experiences. Cowley and Wilson also had on view daguerreotypes of
Lola, A.M. Quinn, and other celebrities of the day. Madame
Charpiot daguerreotyped also in Bridge street, and Fenton,
Coldrey, and Co. practised in collodion near what was then the
horse bazaar, in the Main road. Ellis sold his business to the
late A.V. Smith. After that came Solomon and Bardwell, then
Roberts Brothers, then Wright, then Glenny, then Silverlock, then
Willetts, then Richards and Co., then Chuck, then Williams. The
last four practise here now, and an amateur society has its home
at the School of Mines.</p>
<p>Lithography, or the art of printing from stone, was introduced
in Ballarat by the late Mr. Ronalds, of the Wendouree Nursery
Gardens, in 1853, but his little hand presses were rather
cherished old companions than active workers in those days. In
August, 1856, as mentioned in chapter iii., Robert Bell printed
his <i>Chinese Advertiser</i> from stone, and about the same time
Henry Harris, E.C. Moore, C. Abbott, and others started the first
<i>Ballarat Punch</i>, F.W. Niven assisting in the illustrations
with one of Ronalds' hand presses. In 1857 Niven purchased
Ronalds' presses and began lithographing regularly, subsequently
joining H. Deutsch, in Bridge street. Deutsch was famous in those
days for his lithographic views of old Ballarat, and here and
there exist valuable collections of the street and other views
issued from his office. In 1858 the first steam lithographing
machine in Ballarat and in the colony was started by Niven, at 19
Lydiard street, and was a great success. About the same time
another was got to work in Melbourne, by H. de Grouchy. These
machines were looked upon with great distrust by trade critics,
as although such machines had worked well in France, England, and
other relatively cold climates, they were considered unfit for
Australia. But Mr. Niven says that was the very reason which
induced him to order one through Detmold, of Melbourne, as he
thought the speed of the machine would counteract the tendency of
the stone to dry as the slower hand rollers did. The result
proved the accuracy of the reasoning, for it was found that the
heat here scarcely affected the stone at all, and very soon
Troedel, of Melbourne, found his way to Ballarat to see Niven's
success, and he then followed in Niven's wake. In a short time
machines almost entirely superseded the old hand presses, and
instead of injury to the trade, as had been predicted, their
general use soon increased the amount of lithographic work
tenfold, and where formerly small orders of 100 or so were done
by the hand press at a high cost, the continuous machine turned
out impressions by the million at a cheap rate. This, as in the
case of other machinery, created demand, and employment was made
for establishments with 50 or 60 hands, as at F.W. Niven and
Co.'s works, instead of smaller shops with hand presses and
relatively few employés. As we have said, Deutsch was once a name
here. He sold to F.W. Niven. J. Gellatly and J. Curtis did
lithographic work at one time, but at present Rider and Mercer,
in Lydiard street, and F.W. Niven and Co., in Sturt street, are
the only lithographers in Ballarat. These firms, and notably F.W.
Niven and Co., have made mining plans and similar works
obtainable at small cost, and have thus facilitated the extension
of the mining industry. Lithographic views of Ballarat,
Sandhurst, Warrnambool, and other places, and views of Lake
Wendouree and other scenes in the district have been issued in
abundance from these gas driven lithographic presses, F.W. Niven
and Co. alone being able at present to execute the larger
pictures. Curtis, in Armstrong street, and M'Kee, in Bridge
street, have turbines as a press motive power, Curtis having gas
in addition to the water power.</p>
<p>Xylography, or wood engraving and printing, was introduced
with color printing by Charles Boyd, who brought it from
Philadelphia to Melbourne in 1854, and to Ballarat in 1856. Boyd
cut his own blocks, and is still practising the art at his office
in Sturt street. The Melbourne firm was Walker, Boyd, and Co.,
now Walker, May, and Co., Boyd going alone as a printer in
Ballarat. He claims, in fact, to have, in the elegant language of
America, "licked" all local creation in the printing line, having
won "three medals and five certificates for excellence in
printing&mdash;a record not achieved by any other printer in
Victoria," But Boyd does not affect the finer class of woodcuts;
for that he, like other printers in Ballarat, has recourse to Mr.
William Gooch, of the <i>Argus</i> agency, Ballarat, a past pupil
of M. Jenny, a Swiss artist in Melbourne. The initial letters of
the chapters in this book were engraved in M. Jenny's office, and
Mr. Gooch sustains to-day the prestige of his teacher's
studio.</p>
<p>The Public Library, in Barkly street, was established in 1862,
and is open free to the public. The building is handsome outside,
and the interior library hall very elegant. The foundation stone
was laid by Sir Redmond Barry on the 21st of January, 1867, and
the cost of the building and fittings was about £3500. A hall has
since been added at a cost of £1200. There are 12,000 vols. in
the library, the number of reference books in history and science
being probably the largest and best of any provincial library in
Victoria. The first president was Mr. Emanuel Steinfeld, and the
first librarian Mr. Miller, Mr. Frederick Young having been the
first chairman of committee. To Mr. Miller succeeded Mr. J.
Fitzherbert, and to him Mr. S.E. Mendoza, the present librarian.
A small public library has been opened also in the old Warden's
Court-house in Sturt street, and a project is on foot for the
erection of a suitable building for the purpose of the library.
The officers now (June) are&mdash;R. Baker, M.L.A., president;
J.R. Matthews and W. Evans, vice-presidents; J. Vallins,
librarian; E.H.L. Swifte, secretary.</p>
<p>The Mechanics' Institute, in Sturt street, was born in April,
1859, in a little wooden house between Humffray and Barkly
streets, in Main street, and its first reading-room was opened,
as was afterwards the Ballarat East Public Library, in the
engine-house of the Ballarat Fire Brigade. On the 20th of April,
1859, the first committee was chosen as follows:&mdash;Messrs,
J.B. Humffray, president; A. Anderson and R. Belford,
vice-presidents; J. Stewart, M.D., T.S. Learmonth, H.R. Caselli,
F. Young, and W.C. Smith, trustees; G.G. Mackay, treasurer; C.
Dyte, W.H. Batten, R. Lewis, J. Cathie, D. O'Connor, J. M'Dowall,
R. Mitchell, W. Frazer, J. Dodds, W.B. Withers, W. Cooper, and D.
Oliver, committeemen. Mr. W.H. Batten was subsequently elected
secretary, and has held office ever since. The presidents up to
1870 inclusive were&mdash;J.B. Humffray (two years), A. Anderson
and T. Lang (two years), C. Lister, F.C. Downes (two years), and
Joseph Jones (three years). Since then F.M. Claxton, 1872-3-4-5;
A. Marshall and I.J. Jones, 1875-6; T.H. Thompson, 1877-8; E.W.
Stephens, 1879-80; E. James, 1881; L. Stansfield, 1882; J.R.
Marshall, 1883; J.M. Bickett, 1884; A. Brown, 1885; A. Jack,
1886; H. Wheeler, 1887; E.P. Date being in office for the current
official year. The first stone of the first part of the Sturt
street building was laid with Masonic honors by Mr. H. Cuthbert
on the 28th of September, 1860, and on the 19th of December the
reading-room was opened. The room has been since then enlarged,
and is now the most spacious of the kind in the colony. The
completed building, designed by J.H. Jones, is one of the largest
and handsomest in the town. It was opened for a fine arts
exhibition by his Excellency the Governor on the 21st of July,
1869. There are 1200 members on the roll, and near 14,000 vols,
in the library. A billiard room is now part of the Institute. It
was opened in February, 1879. The Institute is now free of debt.
In May, 1870, while Haydon's "Aristides" yet hung in the hall of
the Institute in the exhibition then on view there. General Tom
Thumb and his companion dwarfs were also exhibiting themselves to
large crowds. A writer to the <i>Ballarat Star</i>, himself an
artist, remembered Haydon's wail of despair in his diary, and
pointed out the coincidence that 24 years afterwards, and 16,000
miles away from the Egyptian Hall, the picture and the dwarf were
again in contact, and again the dwarf the more popular.</p>
<p>The Academy of Music, in Lydiard street, is the successor of
the old Theatre Royal, in Sturt street, and of the last of the
Charlie Napiers, in Ballarat East. G.V. Brooke laid the
foundation stone of the Royal on the 20th January, 1858, and in
1873 Thespis was deposed in favor of commerce, whose servants
reign there now. In the meantime Mr. C. Dyte had, on the 26th
December, 1861, laid the foundation stone of the last of the
Charlie Napiers, and the first in permanent materials, but that
also has disappeared, after having for some time served as a
brewery for Messrs. Scrase and Ainley. Madame Arabella Goddard
laid the foundation stone of the Academy on the 24th September,
1874, and the house was opened on the 7th June, 1875. The site
belongs to Sir W.J. Clarke, Bart., and the building was erected
at his cost (£12,000) from designs by architect George Brown. The
Academy has a more beautiful interior than had any of the other
theatres, but it is less cosy than the Royal was, and its long
shape is less adapted to the convenience of spectators of the
drama. The Alfred Hall, in Grenville street, built for the
reception of the Duke of Edinburgh when he visited Ballarat, has
been often used for dramatic performances, and is the largest
hall in the city.</p>
<p>The Welsh Eisteddfod has become an established institution in
Ballarat, and it is the only one of the kind extant in Victoria.
These festivals in Ballarat date from the year 1855, and they
have done much to foster and evoke musical talent, not only
amongst the natives of the principality and their children, but
among all classes of citizens. The Eisteddfod is held every St.
David's Day, or on some day as near thereto as is convenient.
Vocal and instrumental music, poetry, oratory, are all subjects
within the programmes, and the best masters are employed as the
awarders of the prizes offered for success. The more prominent of
the originators and promoters of these local festivals were
Messrs. J.B. Humffray, Theophilus Williams, H.B. Williams, R.
Lewis, H. Davies, Ellis Richards, Timothy Thomas, John Morgan,
John Morris, and others.</p>
<p>The Cambrian Society in Ballarat is founded on similar lines
to those of the Melbourne Society, that is for the promotion of
greater unity and a better organisation of mutual help amongst
Welsh colonists, and the keeping alive the fires of Welsh
patriotism. The society was projected on the 30th April last, and
the officers chosen on the 7th May as follow:&mdash;Rev. W.
Thomas, president; Joseph Josephs and Philip Lewis,
vice-presidents; H. Lewis, treasurer; Theos. Williams, secretary,
and W.L. Roberts, assistant secretary; Theos. Rhys, D.W. Davies,
D. Davies, P.L. Jones, J. Harris, P.L. Roberts, J. Lewis, D.
Prosser, committeemen. There are (June) 50 members enrolled.</p>
<p>Musical societies have been many in Ballarat, commencing with
the Philharmonic, which was formed on the 5th of March, 1858, Mr.
D. Oliver in the chair. He was chosen secretary; A.T. Turner,
conductor; A. Fleury, leader; A. Oliver, treasurer; and E. Towl,
Dr. Kupperberg, L. Bruun, C. Franz, J. Lake, J.A. Doane,
Stoddart, E. Gates, Sayers, and J. Stower, committeemen. The
society died in 1863, and was succeeded by the Musical Union,
which also soon died. The Harmonic Society was formed in 1863,
with J. Robson, G.O. Rutter, J. Robson, A.T. Turner, R. Wrigley,
and A.T. Turner as conductors, in order, till the society was
wound up at the end of 1875. The secretaries were R. Wicking,
Holmes, A. Brown, J.R. Pascoe, and then Wicking saw the close of
the society. Then came, in 1866, the Glee and Madrigal Union,
with W. Rees (father of Alice Rees), A. Gray, S. Nightingale,
E.T. Whitten, P. Cazaly, S. Lamble, and J. Knox as its main
elements. It was a quiet <i>quasi</i> private organisation, and
broke in pieces in 1870. The Choral Society was a creation of the
year 1866, with Carl Schmitt as conductor, but did not long
survive its first appearance. Another Choral Society was started
in July, 1873, with Mr. Bucke as leader, succeeded by A.T.
Turner. This society was also short-lived. There was also the
German Leider Krantz, which merged in the Liedertafel of May,
1881, whose first officers were the Hon. H. Cuthbert, president;
C.B. Finlayson and A.T. Morrison, vice-presidents; A. Bruun,
treasurer; J. Bunting, librarian; J. Dunn, secretary; Carl
Hartmann, conductor. The officers at the close of 1886
were&mdash;H. Cuthbert, president; A. Anderson and H. Brind,
vice-presidents; C. Eyres, treasurer; R.L. Nicholl, librarian; J.
Robson, conductor; W.D. Hill, secretary. In 1884 another Musical
Union was born. Its first officers were&mdash;W.S. Matthews,
conductor; J. Ware, treasurer; W. King, secretary; and the
officers now are&mdash;Archdeacon Julius, president; J. M'Leod
and G.K. Coutts, vice-presidents; G. Herbert, R.A.M., conductor;
F. Herbert, pianist; D.J. Coutts, organist; A. Bruun, leader; J.
Ware, treasurer; Bryant, librarian; L.R. Llewelyn, secretary; and
Messrs. Gray, Radley, Hardie, Roberts, Whitten, and Chalmers,
committeemen. The Maennerchor is the latest organisation, a small
band of singers who do not attempt the more ambitious programmes
of the larger societies. There is a great and interesting local
musical, as well as dramatical, history, but there is no room for
it in these pages.</p>
<p>The Ballarat Agricultural and Pastoral Society assumed that
style on the 3rd May, 1865. Previously it was called the Ballarat
Agricultural Society merely. The first record we find of it is a
report of a meeting held at the George hotel on the 14th of June,
1856, Mr. Robert Muir in the chair, when arrangements were made
for the first ploughing match, which was held on Mr. Baird's farm
on the 10th of July, 1856. The records of the society show that
on the 15th August, 1856, a meeting was held in the old Council
Chambers, in Sturt street, when Messrs. R. Muir, J. M'Dowall, T.
Bath, R. Dickson, Butchart, J. Stewart, M.D. Haydon, J. Baird, W.
Sim, and Bilton, were appointed a committee with R. Dickson
secretary, and Messrs. Fisken, Morton, Dalgleish, and M'Intosh
represented the society at the Victorian Board of Agriculture.
The society held its first exhibition of produce on the 12th
March, 1859, in the old brick building called the Corn Exchange
in the Market square. Learmonth and Burrumbeet had a certain
localisation of the society there until the 2nd of April, 1860,
when a unification took place and the society was known as the
Ballarat Society. The first National drain Show was held in the
Ballarat Society's yards on the 22nd and 23rd of October, 1868.
The first Grand Champion Sheep Show was held at Ballarat on the
13th and 14th of September, 1876. The total value of the prizes
awarded at the (eleven sheep shows which have now been held at
Ballarat amounts to the very handsome sum of £6501. The largest
amount received at any one show was at the National Show in 1881,
when over £600 were taken at the gates. During the past 26 years
the society has expended no less than £31,852 in prizes for the
encouragement of rearing and breeding good live stock, and
fostering the manufacture of first-class agricultural implements
and machinery. It has also laid out about £8000 upon show yard
improvements. Its annual exhibitions are attended by large crowds
of visitors from all parts of this colony. The Hon. Philip
Russell, of Carngham, is now the president of the society, an
office which he has held for six years. The secretary, Mr. Simon
Morrison, has held his position in connection with the society
for upwards of 22 years, and Mr. Thomas Bath has been honorary
treasurer for the society for nearly 20 years. The
vice-presidents last elected were Messrs. G.G. Morton, Jas. Baird
(since dead), and W. Anderson, M.L.A. Both the pastoral and
agricultural interests are represented on the committee. The
secretary, Mr. Morrison, states that he learns that the first
ground broken in the Burrumbeet district was by Messrs. Robertson
and Ross, after whom came Messrs. Strachan and Beaton. On the
Learmonth side Messrs. J. Medwell, G.G. Morton, J. Baird, J.
M'Intosh, and Moore were the first. Medwell is said to have put
the first post in the ground at Learmonth, and turned over the
first acre of ground for a crop of potatoes. The magnitude of the
pastoral and agricultural interest of the district is reflected
from that of the demands of the town markets. The author has no
room for many other details of interest in regard to these
important industries.</p>
<p>The Ballarat Horticultural Society was formed in 1859. On the
11th October of that year there was a meeting at Bath's hotel;
present&mdash;Messrs. Ocock (in the chair), T. Lang, W. Elliott,
R.U. Nicholls, C. Tunbridge, B. Hepburn, and G. Binsted, when
preliminaries were discussed. On the 18th of the same month
another meeting was held, at which Dr. Kenworthy (of Eureka
Stockade fame) presided. The society was then formally
constituted, with Dr. Kenworthy president, Dr. Richardson
vice-president, T. Lang treasurer, G. Binsted secretary, and W.
Elliott, G. Smith, W. Appleby, R.U. Nicholls, R. Ocock, J.
Tugwell, and W.H. Foster committeemen. The society held its first
exhibition on the 25th of November, 1859, in W.C. Smith's
sales-room in Sturt street, near the south-east corner of Doveton
street. The Alfred Hall is now the place of exhibition. The
present officers are Messrs. A. Anderson, president; J. Nicholls,
J.C. Chalmers, vice-presidents; A. Fraser, treasurer; J. Ware,
secretary and librarian; N. D'Angri, D. Laidlaw, W. Rattray, S.
Rennie, J. Ross, G. Smith, J. Williams, professional committee;
A. Engeler, A. Gray, H. Hunt, S.D. Partridge, G. Perry, R.W.
Phillips, R. Stringer, amateur committee; F.C. Wainwright, hon.
auditor. There were in June of this year 320 members on the
roll.</p>
<p>The iron, woollen, and other industries of Ballarat demand a
volume for their proper record, but we can only insert here the
more prominent names and doings. The Victoria, Soho, and some
minor iron foundries have lived and died, and to the Victoria
belongs the honor of making the first locomotive in Ballarat.
That was the Lady Barkly, so named by his Excellency Sir H.
Barkly, about the year 1860. The engine was made for Mr. Davies,
an engineer on the Geelong to Ballarat railway. Other engines
were made soon after for New Zealand and West Australia; but a
new and important era arose when the Ph&oelig;nix Foundry
Company, started in February, 1856, by Messrs. Carter, Oldham,
and Shaw, became an incorporated company on the 12th November,
1870, with Mr. W.H. Shaw as manager, and the manufacture of
locomotives for the Victorian railways was begun. The new
departure was a complete success, and the company has established
the largest locomotive factory in Victoria, securing against all
competition the making of nearly the whole of the colonially
manufactured engines. The company delivered the first locomotive
to the Government on the 4th March, 1873, the next day's
<i>Courier</i> saying:&mdash;"At five o'clock to the minute
yesterday morning, locomotive No. 88 left the Ph&oelig;nix
Company's works, in Armstrong street, on the steam lorry
specially made for the conveyance of the engines and tenders to
the railway station." By the 2nd April the engine had completed
its 1000 miles test, and the feat was celebrated by bringing up a
special train of Cabinet Ministers and others from Melbourne, by
flags all over the city, by pealing of the Alfred Bells, and by a
banquet in the city hall. The completion of the 100th locomotive
was celebrated on the 13th April, 1883, when there were still
greater rejoicings. Mr. Service (the Premier), other Ministers,
and Parliamentary representatives were present, and the
locomotive was decked with flags, and boughs, and flowers.
Speeches, cheers, pealing of bells, banquets, a whole city
keeping holiday, and the Tubal Cains of the great locomotive
workshop of Victoria as the applauded heroes of the day, made up
a series of sensations long to be remembered. By the end of 1886
the company had delivered 203 complete engines with tenders; and
the company's immense plant is so complete, its workmen so
skilled, its management so able, that practically the Phoenix
Foundry seems to have made successful competition out of the
question at present. The trustees of the company are Messrs. D.
Brophy, chairman; W.H. Shaw, manager; R.G. Middleton, secretary;
G. Perry, Thos. Bodycomb. The value of the industry locally is
seen in the distribution of near £2000 monthly in wages, and the
creation of a school where hosts of youths learn one of the most
valuable of all the mechanical arts. The Union Foundry, started
in March, 1865, by Messrs. J. Walker, J.F. Woods, T. Bradcock,
and W. Sandry, changed its firm status by losing Mr. Sandry and
gaining Mr. W.F. Harrington, a branch having been in the meantime
opened at Maryborough, in Queensland. Then in October, 1872, Mr.
John Hickman bought half of the Ballarat business, and the local
firm became Walker, Hickman, and Co., and since November, 1879,
Mr. Hickman has been sole proprietor. The firm's work is mainly
the manufacture of heavy mining engines and machinery the most
ponderous pumping, hauling, and other plant being sup plied to
mining companies all over the colonies, details of which there is
no space here to narrate. The company's wage-sheet is about £1000
per month, and the importance of the manufacture is second only
to that of the Phoenix works. Bromley and Co., in Windermere
street; Trahar and Sons, Yarrowee; Abraham, Little Bridge street,
of patent windmill and pump fame, have each some special casting
work as their leading trade features. The agricultural implement
factories comprise the works of Kelly and Preston, and Dingle,
Laverick, and Co., in the Creswick road, and Munro's, at
Alfredton, and the products of these factories win prizes all
over the colonies, and find their market even as far as India.
John Tynan's plough factory, in Mair street, is the successor to
older ones under the same direction, and his fame is as great in
that special work as any man's in Australia. The Lal Lal Iron
Company has ceased to be for the time a practically operative
venture, but the company has great resources in valuable ore
lodes, which some day, doubtless, will receive due attention from
capitalists. The School of Mines analysis of the lode shows it to
be haematite brown ore, yielding 50 per cent. of iron, besides
yellow ochre and brown umber pigments.</p>
<p>There are two woollen factories in Ballarat&mdash;the Ballarat
Company's, at Sunny Corner, and Messrs. Dennison, Wynne, and
Hepburn's, in Doveton street north. This last was previously held
by Wilson and Co., and was originally a flour mill owned by a Mr.
Hayes. This factory is mainly employed in the manufacture of
coarse tweeds, and is a private property. The Ballarat Company is
an incorporated venture, and was started in October, 1871, work
commencing in June, 1873, with one set of machines. Improvements
were made from time to time, until the whole of the capital
(£40,000) had been called up, and by the end of 1886 the company
had 40 looms at work and 130 hands employed. Flannels and
blankets were first made, and then fine cloths and tweeds. The
greater part of the clothing for the Victorian militia has been
made by the company, and now the company has built larger rooms
and obtained additional plant with which to manufacture worsted
and compete for the £5000 bonus offered by the Government for the
first production of that class of goods. Up to the end of 1886
the company had paid three dividends of 7½ per cent. on the
capital, the net profit for the half-year ending 31st December,
1886, being set down at £1194 2s. 11d. Mr. David Melvin is the
manager, Mr. J.T. Williams the secretary, and Messrs. Alex. Bell
(chairman), Robert Bell, and J.C. Smith, directors.</p>
<p>Coachbuilding began very early in Ballarat, and the various
exhibitions in the district have shown that the local factories
can produce vehicles which may rival the elegancies of Long Acre.
The leading firms to-day are Jones and Trembath, in Mair street;
Cutter, in Chancery lane; and Dickson, in Armstrong street.</p>
<p>There are two steam flour mills at work now in
Ballarat&mdash;that of Fry and Co., Limited, Wendouree, and that
of Mr. Nicholson, in Armstrong street. There are two bone
mills&mdash;Jopling's, on the Creswick road, and Elsworth's, at
the upper end of Pennyweight Gully. The breweries comprise Leggo
and Sons' Barley Sheaf, Creswick road; Magill and Coghlan's,
Warrenheip, Tulloch and M'Laren's Royal Standard, Armstrong
street, all large and long established properties, and of growing
value, besides the more recent Black Horse Brewery, Ascot street,
G.T. Lee, proprietor The Warrenheip Distillery Company, famous
for its spirits, has about 150 acres of land at Dunnstown, an
unfailing supply of spring water, and turns out about 80,000
gallons of whiskey, geneva, and rectified spirits of wine per
annum, which could be increased, if need were, to 100,000
gallons. The proprietors are Messrs. Göller, Brind, and
Walker.</p>
<p>Cordial factories in Ballarat are three in number, namely, E.
Rowlands (late Rowlands and Lewis), in Dana street; O'Hehir and
Co., in Errard street; and T.A. Hawkins and Co., in Lydiard
street. They all manufacture ærated waters and cordials; but
Rowlands' factory, as being the first in Ballarat, and as being
one whose fame and extent are quite unique in the colony, demands
special notice. In 1854 the original firm started making
lemonade, soda water, and ginger beer on the shores of what is
now Lake Wendouree, when eight hands were employed. To-day the
firm has five depots&mdash;Ballarat, Melbourne, Sydney, Creswick,
and Smythesdale&mdash;the first three being manufacturing places,
at each of which an eight horse-power steam engine is used, and
in all 300 hands are employed, receiving an aggregate weekly wage
of £330, the 1854 Ballarat output of 300 dozen bottles a day
having grown to a daily manufacture in 1886 of between 3000 and
4000 dozen, whilst the first day's Melbourne make of 6 dozen in
July, 1873, had grown to an output of 3547 dozen in one day of
last year. A big stride this, surely, and one to note. Meanwhile
the simple triad of beverages which sufficed for the diggers of
1854 has been followed by waters and cordials galore. The
factories of the firm now produce, besides the original three
comforts, seltzer, potass, lithia, magnesia, apollinaris,
Carlsbad, and tonic waters; ginger ale, sarsaparilla, Ballan
seltzer, vigorine, noyau, maraschino, curaçoa, rhatang bitters,
orange bitters, aromatic bitters, quinine bitters, sarsaparilla
extract, hop bitters, alkine bitters, ærated bitterade, ginger
brandy, pine apple syrup, ginger wine, raspberry vinegar, lime
juice syrup, lemon syrup, peppermint, cloves, milk punch. This
list symbolises the development of the firm's trade, which is
spread all over the colonies. A commercial witness, of some
travel himself, writes to the author:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Mr. Rowlands, by the introduction of his manufactures
all over the colonies, does more to advertise Ballarat than does
any other manufacturer; for, as one gentleman said to me at
Deniliquin once, "When you get beyond the reach of Rowlands' soda
water, you are beyond the pale of civilised society," and though
I do not agree absolutely with that, still I recognise the fact
that in all the colonies, and in the leading towns in Victoria,
Ballarat drinks, through the agency of Rowlands, are
obtainable.</blockquote>
<p>Even the fiery teetotaller may well exclaim-&mdash;"More power
to this earnest solacer of thirsty souls, and may his
unintoxicating shadow never grow less." The <i>Australasian Trade
Review</i>, of a year or two ago, was full of interesting details
of the firm's doings, for which we have no space in these pages;
but the writer there gives us a glimpse of the inner works when
he says the Dana street works can turn out over 3000 dozen
bottles a day, and that at the vigorine counter alone in the
Collins street factory "half a score of men and boys are kept
labelling and gold foiling the bottles, of which thousands of
dozens are sent out monthly, and the sale steadily increasing."
The Ballarat factory has, as general manager and foreman
respectively, Messrs. A. Attwood and Joseph Franklin, the
Melbourne factory Messrs. D. Jones and Thos. Ferguson, and the
Sydney factory Messrs. J. Jones and W. Moxom. Franklin is the
nestor of the firm's employés, for he has breathed the
effervescing atmosphere of the factories for 32 years now gone.

gives most of his trade patronage to Ballarat firms.</p>
<p>Ballarat possesses three bacon factories&mdash;to wit,
Farmer's, Day's, and Foord's, whose hams, flitches, and sausages
have gone out to the ends of Australia, and made the makers
baconically famous. Of tanneries, Anderson's, by Wendouree, is
the oldest, and belonged originally to Messrs. Burrington,
Anstis, and Baker. At Fellmongers and at Buninyong there are
tanning works, Messrs. Davies and Graham's, at the latter place,
being one of the larger works. Boot factories have multiplied of
late years in Ballarat, the latest outcome being a co-operative
factory born in a strike a year or two ago. It is not paying
dividends, or none are publicly announced. There is a clog
factory in Humffray street; and of the boot factories those of
Whitten and Cairns, in Dana street. Book and Sons, in Main
street, and Davies and Graham, in Armstrong street, are the
larger.</p>
<p>The first Juvenile Industrial Exhibition in Victoria was
opened in Ballarat on the 15th February, 1878, by his Excellency
Sir G. Bowen, in the Alfred Hall and in the market hall then
adjacent. It was projected and managed by Mr. R.D. Bannister, and
was very successful. A credit balance of £758 17s. 2d. remained
at the close, and was vested in the following trustees&mdash;A.
Hunter, H.R. Caselli, J. Buley, G.O. Preshaw, and H. Reid.
Subsequently J. Hickman and E. Curtis were appointed in place of
Buley and Caselli, deceased, and J.C. Smith in place of Preshaw,
removed. With £500 of the money entrusted the trust purchased the
frontage in Lydiard street, on which the Commercial Club building
and other offices stand. The site was let on a 40 years' building
lease to the club, at a rental of £91 a year, with the right of
purchase for £3000 at any time within 15 years from the date of
the lease. A commemorative banquet was given in the city hall on
the 1st of last month (June) by Mr. Hickman to the committee and
representative citizens, when Mr. H. Bradbury, the exhibition
secretary, read a report showing that there was £725 in bank at
interest. The banquetters resolved informally that another
exhibition should be held as soon as possible.</p>
<p>There are three volunteer fire brigades in Ballarat&mdash;the
Ballarat, the City, and the Soldiers' Hill brigades. The Ballarat
was established in 1856, and has its engine station at the corner
of Barkly and East streets. It has 40 members, was the first in
Victoria to procure a steam fire engine, and to its generally
complete outfit is now adding a set of Bright's electric fire
alarms. The City Brigade was established in 18-59, a previous
organisation having disbanded because the municipal authorities
refused a subsidy. The brigade's engine station is at the corner
of Sturt and Raglan streets, and it has a steam engine as part of
its large equipage. There used to be a Sebastopol Brigade, but
the City Brigade has taken over that body's duties, and now has a
member roll of 40. A Soldiers' Hill Juvenile Brigade was formed
in 1879, and disbanded in 1881, and the present brigade was
formed. It has no engine, but has a look-out station, and hose,
hose carriages, hydrants, branches, and couplings. The fire
fighters of Ballarat have won much fame alike in their intrepid
battles with the igneous disasters of the past in Ballarat, and
in the competitions which since then have been held in all the
colonies. The brigades are at present officered as
follow:&mdash;Ballarat Brigade&mdash;W. Trotman, captain; C.H.
Crannage, lieutenant; G.A. Beyer, secretary; J.B. Johns,
treasurer; J. Coward, hose officer; J.W. Dark, apparatus officer;
A. Anderson, F.H. Drew, T.H. Lawn, trustees; Rudolf Müller,
caretaker. City Brigade&mdash;J. M'Donald, captain; G. Palmer,
lieutenant; A. M'Garey, hose officer; J.C. Fraser, apparatus
officer; J. M'Kenzie, engineer; J.H. Leggo, treasurer; T. Curnow,
secretary; W. Perry, caretaker. Soldiers' Hill&mdash;H. Carlyon,
captain; W. Rooney, lieutenant; J. Burke, hose officer; R.
Henderson, apparatus officer; H. Fern, secretary; S. Selman,
treasurer.</p>
<p>The volunteer corps of Ballarat Rangers was the outcome of a
movement in the year 1857. On the 23rd of October, 1857, a
meeting, convened by Mr. Ocock, was held at Bath's, now Craig's,
hotel, Ballarat West, "to consider the propriety of establishing
a rifle corps in this district." Mr. A. Davies presided, Mr.
Cooper acted as secretary, and Messrs. Davies, Wilkes, Coleman,
Cooper, Daly, Ocock, and Major Wallace (then sheriff), were
appointed a committee to prepare a memorial to the Government. On
21st of July, 1858, the consent of the Government to the
enrolment of a corps was received, and on the 26th of July a
meeting was held in the Shakspeare hotel, Main street, Ballarat
East, Mr. W.B. Rodier in the chair, when the name "Rangers" was
rejected, and it was agreed that the name should be the "Ballarat
Volunteer Rifle Regiment". The regiment was to consist of four
divisions of infantry and two of cavalry. On the 9th August the
first meeting of enrolled members was held at the Shakspeare
hotel. At this meeting Mr. Richard Belford, who had been then, or
was soon afterwards, elected Lieut.-Colonel, presided, and it was
reported that there were 65 members on the roll. The rules were
referred to the committee for revision, and on the 24th of August
Mr. Belford presided at another meeting, held at Bath's hotel,
when Major Wallace, who was a half-pay officer of the line, was
elected adjutant, C. Forster captain, J. Daly first lieutenant,
and D. Sweeney second lieutenant of infantry; and Alley captain,
and A. Kelly and A. Davies first and second lieutenants of
cavalry; Mr. Rodier acting as treasurer, and Mr. Just as
secretary. Mr. Belford subsequently resigned office, and Major
Wallace became the chief. The name of the corps also was changed
to "Ballarat Rangers". The corps after that consisted of three
companies of infantry; Nos. 1 and 3 being manned in Ballarat West
and East respectively, and No. 2 in Clunes and Creswick. The
cavalry force of the colony, called the Prince of Wales Light
Horse, was a distinct arm of the service then also, and a troop
existed for some time in Ballarat. Of the Ballarat Rangers the
commissioned officers, when this History was issued in 1870,
were:&mdash;1st Company&mdash;W.C. Smith, major; J. Johnston, W.
Henderson, and R.W. Musgrove, captains; W.P. Whitcombe,
assistant-surgeon. 2nd Company&mdash;P. Keatch, captain, Creswick
detachment; B. Jessup, captain, and L. Le Gould, lieutenant,
Clunes detachment. 3rd Company&mdash;J.T. Sleep, captain
commandant; A.M. Greenfield, captain and adjutant; J. Ivey,
captain; T. Hillas, assistant-surgeon; A.J. Boulton, lieutenant.
Of the Ballarat troop of cavalry E.C. Moore was captain, J.H.
Mount lieutenant, and G. Nicholson assistant-surgeon. Mr. Ocock,
whose tall gaunt figure had a military look, and whose nose bore
a striking resemblance to that prominent feature in the face of
the Hero of Waterloo, was one of the first, if not the first, to
drill the beginnings of the cavalry force here, and James
M'Dowall, one of the troop of that day (1857) says they were
frequently taken out as far as Miners' Rest on drilling
excursions. The troop had C.W. Sherard as captain after that,
then E.C. Moore, Julius Mount, D. Madden, the last captain being
James A. Wilson, the troop being disbanded in December, 1883.
Attached to the troop was a Rifle Club, whose first meeting was
held at the old Orderly-room on the 5th of January, 1873, the
foundation members being Lieut.-Colonel Rede, patron; Surgeon
Nicholson, president; Lieutenants Madden and Carty,
vice-presidents; Lieut.-Colonel Rede and Troopers Purdue and
Beck, handicappers; Sergeant Wilson, treasurer; Trooper Deeble,
secretary; Sergeant Tannock, and Troopers Lynch, Quinan, Lynch,
Brown, Cummins, Skoglund, Walden, Snowball, Horwood, Rayreux,
Russell, Young, Lynch, and Farming being also members. In 1883,
the year of the disbanding of the cavalry troop, the Rifle Club
also was broken up, and new defence legislation by Parliament led
to the formation of a militia in place of the old volunteer
infantry. There was an earlier civilian Rifle Club in 1860, whose
practice; butts were on the Golden Point range. Messrs. Clissold
(president), Mumby, C. Boyd, Wanliss, M'Ivor, and others were of
that club, and matches were a regular addition to the ordinary
practice pastime of the members.</p>
<p>The Rangers were disbanded when the Militia Bill was passed,
and the first militia battalion for Ballarat was started in
November, 1883. The first name was taken on 24th November, 1883,
and the first batch of recruits sworn in on the 21st January,
1884. The officers of the battalion when first formed were the
senior officers of the disbanded Ballarat
Rangers&mdash;Lieut.-Colonel J.T. Sleep, Major A.M. Greenfield,
Major L.H. Kildahl, Captain and Adjutant Thos. Mann. Surgeon R.D.
Pinnock, Majors Greenfleld and Kildahl, were gazetted to their
majorities after the formation of the militia. The establishment
provided for 326 officers and men, the former including, besides
those already named, 3 captains and 8 lieutenants. For these
vacancies 10 recruits were selected, and at the examinations held
the following passed, and on 30th June, 1884, were posted
lieutenants to the battalion:&mdash;R.E. Williams, J. Garbutt,
H.A. King, T. Holding, W. Laidlaw, J. M'Whae, H.D. Longden, E.
Hayes, D. Madden, and F.W. Claxton. Subsequently Lieutenant
Holding retired to the unattached list, and Lieutenants Williams,
Garbutt, King, Laidlaw, M'Whae, and Hayes were promoted to be
captains as vacancies occurred. Other changes and promotions
followed, including Captain Williams' elevation to a majority on
the retirement of Major Kildahl; but, much to the author's
regret, there is not space for further details. The battalion has
well held its place in all respects, and is now in possession of
one of the finest orderly rooms in Victoria, with a spacious
parade ground adjacent.</p>
<p>The Gas Company is a private corporation, dating from 1858,
with a capital of £35,000, and a freehold of 3½ acres, bounded on
the west by Albert street, on the south by Dana street, on the
east and north by Grenville street and the back of allotments in
Lewis street. The first directors were Messrs. J. Hepburn, M.J.
Cummins, R. Belford, J. Gibb, R.B. Gibbs, E.A. Wynne, and Dr.
Stewart. The engineers have been Messrs. Jones, father and son,
and the present Mr. S.E. Figgis; and the secretaries Mr. G.
Binsted, and Messrs. S. and W.H. Figgis, father and son. Exactly
100 days after the turning of the first sod for the erection of
the works, gas was first turned on at the main for the supply of
the town. This opening of the works was performed by Mr. J.B.
Humffray on Saturday evening, 17th July, 1858, and the newspapers
speak of the "brilliant devices" illuminating the gas works and
other parts of the town. Wesley Church was the first public
building lit by the company; but gas made by a Mr. Courtis from
gum leaves and oil had before then been used in Christ Church,
Bath's hotel, and other places, and the old Charlie Napier was
lighted about the same time with gas of a similar kind made by
Mr. John Gibbs. The Ballarat company's revenue for the first year
of supply was £12,000, and at the close of 1868 it was £24,600,
with 1200 consumers, and at the close of 1886 the revenue was
£27,497, with 2720 consumers, the total expenditure having been
£98,626. At first the price of gas was 40s., and has since been
reduced to 8s. 4d. per 1000 feet, less discounts of from 5 to 10
per cent. to large consumers, the rate of dividends paid being 10
per cent. per annum. The best appliances in manufacture have been
added from time to time, and the gas-making power at the close of
last year was 2,000,000 cubic feet per week, and the storage room
400,000 feet, the quality of the gas being set down at 18 candle
power. There are five gas-holders, the latest being a telescopic
one of 200,000 cubic feet capacity. The author regrets to be
compelled, by want of space, to suppress divers details anent
this and suburban companies.</p>
<p>The Banks are nearly all clustered in Lydiard street, between
Dana and Mair streets. The Bank of Australasia, Union, London
Chartered, National, Colonial, New South Wales, Victoria, City of
Melbourne, and Ballarat Banking Company are there, and all have
buildings more or less elegant and costly, whose architectural
prominence attracts the notice of every visitor to the town. The
designs for these edifices are generally some phase of Italian.
The Commercial Bank is at the city hall, corner of Sturt and
Armstrong streets, occupying the whole of the Armstrong street
ground floor of the hall, and part of the Sturt street front
also. The Mercantile Bank has taken over Mr. Oddie's premises at
the corner of Dana and Armstrong streets, and the London
Chartered Bank has a branch in Post office place Ballarat
East.</p>
<p>The Ballarat Savings Bank completed its thirtieth year on 15th
of last November, and during the thirty years £2,075,023 7s. 5d.
was paid in, £100,048 13s. 10d. was credited in interest to
depositors, £1,948,577 7s. 1d. was paid out to depositors, 40,663
accounts were opened and 32,188 closed, leaving on the 15th of
November last 8,475 depositors with £226,494 14s. 2d. to their
credit. William Thomas Pooley was the first actuary, and to him
Charles Wale Sherard, the present actuary, succeeded in 1870.</p>
<p>Australians love out of door sports, and Ballarat has its
share of recreation reserves, as the Eastern Oval, the Western
Oval, Russell Square, Miners' Racecourse, Mount Pleasant Reserve,
Sebastopol Oval, whilst the Saxon Paddock, private property by
Wendouree, is rented by the Ballarat Football Club, and has a
stand erected for spectators.</p>
<p>The Eastern Oval is the oldest and most popular place of
resort for cricket. The Ballarat Cricket Club was founded in
1856, when Daniel Sweeney (captain), Henry Davies, and some
others were active promoters of the club. On the 29th of October,
1856, the club had its first practice on the then open flat near
the present Oval. To secure the present reserve the club and the
borough council have worked together generally, the club spending
large sums in making the Oval what it now is&mdash;one of the
finest cricket grounds in Australia. The officers of the club now
are&mdash;Messrs. C.B. Finlayson, president; H. Brind, J. Shiels,
vice-presidents; Alex. Miller, treasurer; E.J. Wollaston,
secretary; Bain, Williams, O'Connor, Dunn, Hunt, Ferguson,
Martyr, Pearson, committeemen. At the pavilion was for some time
treasured a rude lightwood bat, one of the first played with by
the club. In the Cricket Reserve the Ballarat Bowling Club has a
green. The first president of this club was Donald Macrae. There
is also a tennis court there, and during the winter season the
Oval is used for football exploits. A new grandstand and pavilion
are projected, as well as a union of the cricket and one of the
football clubs; but nothing in that respect is yet settled. There
is a book of local sports yet to be written, and it must suffice
us here to say that, besides a second bowling club, the Central,
in Mair street, cricket and football clubs are now as plentiful
in Ballarat as yellow leaves in autumn. The Ballarat is, as of
old, the leading cricket club; and the Ballarat, the Imperial
(born Galatea), and the South Ballarat are the leading football
clubs. All of these have had first class players, and they have
generally been drawn away to the metropolis to strengthen the
several clubs there. Those three clubs are at present officered
as follow:&mdash;Ballarat&mdash;T. Bath, president; S.L. Bailey,
J. Shiels, and C. Welch, vice-presidents; R.M. Duthie, treasurer;
A.B. Berry, secretary; E. Williams, J.S. Reid, D. Davies, A.
Reynolds, A. Bodycomb, W. Palmer, F. Mann, Graham, J. Brown, W.
M'Millan, J. Manderson, W. Christie, committeemen.
Imperial&mdash;J.M. M'Kenzie, senior, president; R. Chinnery, W.
Peach, J. Leggo, W.H. Hennah, J. M'Donald, G. Williams, J. Reed,
D. Cameron, Manning, J.T. Sleep, J.C. Chambers, and E. Catherall,
vice-presidents; G. Williams, treasurer; J. Cunningham,
secretary; Douglass, delegate; W. Robertson, G. M'Kenzie, J.
Young, A. Gough, T. Thomas, committeemen. South
Ballarat&mdash;President, Dr. E.G. Ochiltree; vice-presidents, C.
Stewart, H.L. Pobjoy, W. Barton, J.T. Williams, H. O'Connor; P.
O'Neil, delegate; J. Finnegan, D. Montgomery, J. Lyons, C.
Vaughan, J. Caldwell, W. Perkins, H. Watson, committeemen; H.F.
Elliott, treasurer; J.G. Rennie, secretary.</p>
<p>The Ballarat Hunt Club was formed in 1881 at the instance of
Mr. A. Chirnside, of Werribee, who acted as master, with Mr. A.
Wynne as treasurer, and Mr. R. Macrae as secretary. It hunts
deer, foxes, and sometimes bits of kerosened rag. Saturdays are
the days, and the "fields" are generally numerous, and made up of
more or less valorous people of both sexes.</p>
<p>The Ballarat Turf Club is the successor of the Ballarat and
Creswick Race Club, which began racing in 1853, and it has a
reserve of 486 acres in Dowling Forest properly laid out as a
course, with grandstand and other belongings. Mr. A.M. Greenfield
is the secretary, and Messrs. II. Walsh, C.W. Sherard, H.
Cuthbert, A.M. Greenfield, M. Loughlin, A. Wynne, and R. Orr are
the trustees of the freehold. The Miners' Racecourse is on the
Sebastopol plateau, where racing began in 1863, was discontinued
in 1883, after a race on the 6th April of that year, and was
revived this year. In the interim the course was fenced, and a
grandstand erected, the last race meeting being on Jubilee Day,
21st June just past. The trustees of the course are Messrs. B.
Hepburn, M. Loughlin, J. King, R. Stewart, and R. Walsh, and J.A.
Blight is the club secretary. The Lal Lal Club has its course
near the Lal Lal Falls, and its great trysting time is New Year's
Day, when holiday folk gather there in thousands. The officers
last New Year's Day were&mdash;R. Häger, president; D.
Fitzpatrick, vice-president; J. Tannock, judge; T. Cahir,
starter; G. Vowles, handicapper; Colonel Sleep, timekeeper; H.
Way, clerk of the course; R. Vickers, weigher; J.A. Blight,
secretary.</p>
<p>The Ballarat Coursing Club was formed at a meeting in the
George hotel on the 22nd May, 1873, Dr. Whitcombe in the chair,
when the chairman, and Messrs. R.U. Nicholls, J. Hughan, F.
Parker, Wood, A. Clarke, D. Bantock, J. Johnstone, T. Creighton,
and J. Ward were appointed a provisional committee. Subscription
was fixed at two guineas, the rules of the Victoria Club were
adopted, and Mr. J. Johnstone was appointed secretary. The first
registration of dogs was by B. Hepburn and J. Hughan on the 15th
September, 1873. The first coursing meeting was at the Pentland
Hills on the 7th August, 1873, but there had been coursing before
the club was formed. Some years anterior to the date of the
formation of the club Messrs. B. Hepburn and others had coursed
wallaby on Struan Robertson's run at Narracoorte, on the South
Australian frontier, and soon after that Messrs. Hepburn, J.
Leonard, and David Jones, obtained hares from the Government
depôt in Phillip Island. Since that time there has been regular
coursing, the plumpton at Ercildoune being now the club's
ordinary trysting place. The present officers of the club are Sir
S. Wilson, president; Messrs. R. Chirnside and B. Hepburn,
vice-presidents; J. Lombard, treasurer; S. Cadden, secretary.</p>
<p>The present Gun Club is the successor to the Pigeon Shooting
Club established in 1861, with G.C. Tuckett, president; R.U.
Nicholls, secretary and treasurer; and W. Bignell, J. Whitehouse,
C. Winsor, J.R. Torbitt, W.H. Ford, T.R. Hewet, and J. White,
committeemen. In 1864 the club reported that it "attained the
object for which it was established, viz., sport, recreation, and
the scientific use of the gun." A year or two after that it died,
and from its ashes sprang up in 1872 the present Gun Club, whose
aim, amongst other things, was and is "to demonstrate the
shooting qualities of guns with various methods of charging, such
trials to be registered." The club's "amended rules" of 1879 do
not recite that scientific aim; but the secretary assures the
author that the club pursues its original purpose in that regard.
In 1872 the club started with Colonel Rede president, F. Peyton
secretary, and T. Eyres, E. Rowlands, R.U. Nicholls, and H.D.
Cave committeemen. The present officers are&mdash;Norman Wilson,
president; W.D. Clarke, vice-president; C.H.F. Walker, treasurer;
T.W. Purdue, secretary: and J. Allender, D. M'Donald, J.G.
Robertson, J. Stout, junior, T. Tindale, C. Whitpaine, and R.
Moffatt, committeemen. The club has its own freehold of eight
acres, and a pavilion near the old Essex mine, between the
Creswick road and the Learmonth road, the cost of which was £700.
Large prizes are given annually, the amount last year being £325,
including a £175 handicap, open to all the colonies.</p>
<p>The Ballarat Acclimatisation Society, formed in 1870, has done
good work in stocking lakes and streams in the district with
fish; ova of trout, perch, carp, and other fish having been
procured for the purpose, and the society has been the means of
distributing fish over many parts of the colony. One importation
of American white fish did not succeed, and since then one of
grayling ova proved to be a failure, but the society does not on
that account lose heart, and fresh efforts will be made, amply
warranted by the large successes which have made earlier
experiments fruitful. Some American brook trout ova have very
recently been received. The society's officers are Messrs. Dr.
W.P. Whitcombe, president; C. Taylor, secretary; G. Perry,
treasurer; Alex. White, W.T. Thompson, C. Salter, F.M. Claxton,
J.N. Wilson, J. Hickman, committeemen. Other acclimatisers,
notably Mr. C.H.J. Walker, gave us the blackbird, thrush, and
other welcome singing birds. Still there were others, who, moved
by less happy inspiration, introduced the stag, hare, rabbit,
fox, and sparrow, and the last three have become general pests.
Especially is it thus with the rabbit. He has multiplied and
subdued the country. He has devastated millions of acres of grass
and grain lands, robbed the farmers of their harvests, lowered
the value of land, and the Legislature has intervened with
special laws for the lessening of the plague, which still
prevails, however, to an alarming extent in some parts of the
colony.</p>
<p>Roller skating has been practised in Ballarat on several
occasions, notably for a time on the floor of the Academy of
Music, but the first place devoted specially to the pastime was
the link in Dawson street, which was opened on the 13th of last
April. That rink occupies a quarter acre, less a surrounding
platform some live or six feet wide. It was built for Mr. A.W.
Ridgley, the lessee, at a cost of about £1,500, the site being
leased for five years from Mr. Robert Sim. American and other
modes of skating are taught in Ridgley's arena. Rinks have since
been opened in Grenville and Skipton streets by local
proprietors.</p>
<p>The Caledonian Society was formed in November, 1858, and the
first sports were held on New-Year's Day, 1859, on what is now
known as the Eastern Oval. Mr. Hugh Gray was the first president,
and with him as judges on that day were Charles Roy, Donald
M'Donald, and Donald Gunn, the pipers being Andrew Wattie and
Donald Rowan. There had been two annual gatherings before this,
the first being held on the ground between the sites now occupied
by the villas of Mr. E.W. Stephens and Mr. F.W. Niven, in Webster
street. At this first gathering Edward Dufferin Allison, M.D.,
presided. The Buninyong Highland Society was formed about this
time also. The Copenhagen Grounds, near the Royal Park, were for
some years the Ballarat Society's trysting place, and then the
gatherings were held in the Recreation Reserve in Eyre street,
but they have been discontinued for some years. A wrestling club
was formed in 1850, and some accomplished athletes exhibited
feats in the Cumberland and Westmorland styles, as well as in the
Devon and Cornish kinds of wrestling. These feats were first
performed in the Charlie Napier Theatre, and they afterwards
formed a portion of the programme of events at several of the
Caledonian Society's New-Year gatherings.</p>
<p>The Hibernian Society, formed in Ballarat on the 7th July,
1868, is now called the Hibernian Australian Catholic Benefit
Society. The first president was Mark Young; vice-president,
Michael O'Grady; secretary, Michael Deegan; treasurer, John
Berry. In November last there were 137 members. St. Patrick's Day
is the society's great festival time; sports are held under its
auspices annually, and since their commencement some £600 have
been divided by the society between the Hospital, and the
Benevolent and Orphan Asylums of Ballarat. The present officers
are:&mdash;President, Martin Ryan; vice-president, J.H. Knight;
treasurer, Charles Fitzgerald; secretary, D.J. Doyle. The place
of ordinary meeting is the belfry-house in the Cathedral reserve
of St. Patrick, and the society is under the patronage of the
resident Catholic clergy. There are branches now all over
Australia, and the members wear green scarves and other
decorations.</p>
<p>On the north-west of the Botanic Gardens is the Reformatory
for boys, originally an Industrial School, for neglected boys not
convicted of crime. During 1886 there were 87 boys admitted to
the Reformatory, of whom 58 have been newly committed. The
superintendent was Captain Evans, an expert of some repute, to
whom succeeded Mr. E. Charles Connor, and under his care the
tendency to abscond seems to be notably declining. In 1884 the
percentage of absconders was 13.06, but in 1885 only 2.81, and in
1886 2.56.</p>
<p>The Rev. Lockhart Morton, of the Ebenezer Presbyterian Church,
established, in June, 1886, a "Hope Lodge", where drunkards have
found a refuge from themselves and their temptations. The Lodge
is supported by voluntary aid, takes no note of creed or
nationality, and has been a blessing to many a poor wretch unable
to say "no" to the tempter from within or without.</p>
<p>Ballarat history includes a record of the foundation of the
road boards and their successors, the shire councils of Ballarat,
Buninyong, Bungaree, Creswick, and Grenville, which have local
jurisdiction in the rural territories surrounding the city and
its suburbs, but there is no space here for notice of their
origins and internal histories. The same remark applies to the
local origins and developments of the originals or branches of
the several banking establishments, the Australian Natives'
Association, Miners' Association, Amalgamated Miners'
Association, Mine Managers' Association, Mine Owners'
Association, Master Tradesmen's Association, Ironworkers'
Association, Young Men's Christian Association, the Mutual
Improvement Associations, the dead Eclectic and the not yet dead
Psychological Associations, the Medical, Medical Benefit,
Debating, Building, Temperance, and St. Andrew's Societies,
divers Trades' Unions, the Field Club, the Friendly Societies,
their lodges and dispensary, the potteries and brickfields, and
other things, in respect of which the author has, sorrowfully, to
be content with their mere enumeration here.</p>
<p>The railway from Geelong to Ballarat was opened on the 11th
April, 1862, and since then extensions have been made from
Ballarat through Creswick to the lines northward; through the
Learmonth country to Ararat, Stawell, and the Wimmera district,
to the South Australian frontier, joining with the line to
Adelaide; through Haddon to Smythesdale and Scarsdale; and
through Warrenheip to Ballan as part of the direct line to
Melbourne. Short lines have also been run off to the Dowling
Forest Racecourse, to the City Cattle-yards, and to the City
Produce Market.</p>
<p>In 1885 the City Council obtained leave to construct tramways,
but the Government took ample time in making the concession, as
the council's application was the first outside the metropolis,
and the concession involved, in fact, the determination of the
basis for future concessions or "orders" to provincial bodies.
Having obtained leave, the council leased to Mr. Edward Thompson,
of Adelaide, for a term of 30 years, the right to construct and
work the tramways, the conditions being as follow:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>1. Commencing at the bottom of Sturt street, near
Grenville street, or at Lydiard street (at option), and thence
with a line on each side of the central plantation as far as
Ripon street; thence by a single line on south side of Start
street, as far as the street by the Convent ground to Wendouree
parade and the Botanic Gardens, to a point near the rotunda. 2.
Commencing at junction of Lydiard and Sturt streets, and going
north along Lydiard street to Macarthur street; thence to
Wendouree parade and round the north part thereof to Botanic
Gardens to the point before mentioned, near the rotunda. 3.
Commencing at a point in Sturt street, at junction with Ripon
street, and thence north along Ripon and Fraser streets to
Wendouree parade, going north as far as Macarthur street. 4.
Commencing at junction of Armstrong street south and Sturt
street; thence along Armstrong street and Skipton street to the
city boundary. 5. (And when deemed necessary). From intersection
of Skipton and Drummond streets, along the latter to Sturt
street. Horse traction. Routes&mdash;As required by the council.
Conditions&mdash;As published by the council. Time for
construction&mdash;Nine months to the lake; one year for the
whole, with right to complete earlier and start running the cars.
Option of purchase by council&mdash;During the first 10 years,
£70,000, exclusive of freeholds (if any). At expiration of 30
years the whole concern, plant, &amp;c., to be given over to the
council without cost. Terms offered&mdash;£1575 per annum when
lines are laid down, or £150 per mile per annum directly cars are
allowed to run on any finished portion, such terms to be
irrespective of profit on investment. The fares to be charged
shall not exceed 3d. for three miles, and for shorter distances
at the basis of Id. per mile between certain points to be
tabulated and agreed on between the council and the promoter. The
tram cars shall commence running not later than 8 o'clock a.m.,
and shall continue running until 11 o'clock p.m., at intervals of
15 and 30 minutes. Cars may run earlier or later than above at
such times and fares as may from time to time be arranged between
the council and the promoter.</blockquote>
<p>Early in 1887 the contractor let his contract to a company
floated in Melbourne. This company was in 32,000 shares of £2
each, of which 17,000 were at once given out for allottal to the
public, and were taken up. Whilst this chapter is going through
the press, the company is laying down materials and taking steps
for the erection of the houses necessary for stables and workmen
in connection with the formation of the works.</p>
<p>The first part of the present Post Office, erected in 1863, at
the north-east corner of Sturt and Lydiard streets, was the sixth
one erected since Ballarat became the resort of the gold-seeker.
At first there was a tent near what is now the corner of Sturt
and Camp streets; then there were "shanties" on Old Post Office
Hill, as the top of Golden Point was named, and at Brown Hill;
then a wooden building at the south-west corner of Lydiard and
Mair streets, where the Royal George hotel now stands. No street
delivery of letters was granted till 1856, and old residents
remember still the crowding and quarrelling to get at the old
post-office window, the police having sometimes to interfere for
the maintenance of the peace. In 1858 the present site was
selected, and an ugly office erected, which was opened on the
10th of September, 1858, the first night mail to Melbourne having
been despatched from Ballarat on the 1st of July in the previous
year. In November, 1859, the post-office, opened in September,
1858, was taken down and another built, which in its turn was
removed. Offices, in continuation of the post-office, have been
built in Lydiard street for the Treasury, Electric Telegraph,
Lands, Public Works, Police, Mining, and Vital Statistics
Registry departments of the Government here.</p>
<p>The Gaol, at the southern end of Lydiard street, was commenced
in 1856 by Gray, a builder, whose contract was for £9000. In 1857
a wooden stockade, surrounding the site, was blown down during a
gale; another was erected and then removed as useless. New
extended plans for the gaol were prepared in 1858, and a second
contract was begun in December of that year by Evans and Barker,
builders, the contract being for £4000. Then, such is the genius
of Government architects for blundering, the plan was condemned,
and Evans and Barker contracted for £9000 more to alter what had
been done, so as to make the gaol plan radiating. Then there was
a contract let to Williams and Young at £9000 for the erection of
boundary walls and certain offices, the establishment as it now
stands being completed early in 1862, at a total cost of between
£40,000 and £50,000. The present Court-house, south of the gaol,
was opened in 1868; the older Court-house, injured by subsidence
of the site, being now the School of Mines.</p>
<p>The Police quarters are, as they have been ever since the
removal from Old Post Office Hill, on the Camp Hill, now no
longer a green mound, but cut up by streets and nearly covered
with buildings. The present warden is Mr. Thomson, who is also
the police magistrate. The old wooden military
barracks&mdash;where a remnant of the 40th Regiment remained
until October, 1857, when that symbol of empire vanished from
Ballarat, as it did soon thereafter from Melbourne&mdash;has
disappeared, and the site is now occupied by more sightly and
more permanent buildings.</p>
<p>At the intersection of Sturt and Lydiard streets is a monument
commemorative of the tragical exploration expedition of Burke and
Wills in 1861. Plans for a monument were prepared as early as
February, 1862, by Canute Andersen, at the instance of a
committee of townsfolk, but the project slept till February,
1863, on the 7th of which month the foundation stone was laid by
his Excellency Governor Barkly, with accompaniment of much
display of processions of public bodies, benefit societies,
parading of volunteers, flags, music, and addresses. The
commemoration was a special duty for this city, for Wills, the
ardent and chivalrous youth who was brave Burke's second, had
lived in Ballarat, where his father practised medicine for some
years. To do this duty well had been honorable, but with the
picturesque celebration of the foundation-laying the enthusiasm
of the committee and the public died. The money collected only
sufficed to raise a sombre block of bluestone as the base of the
projected monument, and the unsightly mass lay there, a mark for
the gibes of visitors, until March, 1866, when another committee
was formed, and the work of discussing ways and means of
finishing the structure re-commenced. Money could not be
collected to carry out the first and better design, and after
more than a year's delay the present monument was decided on, the
borough council voting money in aid of the work. Mr. Andersen
again prepared plans, and again gratuitously. The bottle with
coins and documents deposited by Governor Barkly was exhumed, the
original stonework having been removed, and on the 26th August,
1867, Thomas Davey, mayor of the borough, re-laid the bottle, and
the present structure was thereafter erected. The monument now
consists of an octangular stone reservoir, with a square pier in
the centre, surmounted by a cast-iron basin and a fluted column
of iron bearing four gas lamps, and an urn as a finial. An iron
railing round the top of the octagon has recently been erected.
Water used to be laid on from jets above the iron basin whence it
flowed, as from a huge inverted umbrella, into the stone
receptacle beneath. In the masonry rising from the stone basin
and supporting the iron superstructure, marble slabs are inlaid,
on which are the following inscriptions:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>North side: In memory of the explorers who perished
while crossing the Australian continent in the year 1861. East
side: Robert O'Hara Burke, leader, died 30th June, 1861; William
John Wills, second, died 30th June, 1861; Ludwig Becker,
naturalist, died 29th April, 1861; Charles Grey, assistant, died
17th April, 1861. South side: Erected by the inhabitants of
Ballarat.</blockquote>
<p>The Queen's Jubilee was celebrated right royally in Ballarat
on the 21st of June, and from thirty to forty thousand people
heroically paced for hours through the mud in Sturt street and
Bridge street to witness the illuminations. New Testaments,
bearing each a fac-simile of the Queen's autograph of the text,
"Peace on earth&mdash;good will to men", followed by Her
Majesty's signature, were given to large numbers of State
scholars. Jubilee medals were distributed in some places,
half-crowns were given by the Hon. P. Russell to the children in
his district, and many people gave gifts to the poor instead of
spending money in gas, A worthy method this last, surely, of
celebrating the Jubilee, save where the method was motived less
by sympathy for the poor than by antipathy to the British
connection, and by disloyalty to the Queen as the Imperial symbol
and centre of that connection. Among the more notable events of
the day in Ballarat were a great procession of friendly
societies, fire brigades, old colonists, and others; and the
ceremonial laying of foundation-stones; that of the Art Gallery
by Sir W.J. Clarke, that of the new Stock Exchange by Mr. Thomas
Stoddart, and that of the Old Colonists' Hall by President John
Murray. A banquet was given to those three gentlemen in the
afternoon. Apropos of the Old Colonists, there is only space to
say here that they represent the Old Pioneers who hobnobbed with
Old Bendigonians a decade or more ago, and are some of the
remains of the gallant host of gold discoverers and gold-hunters
of the early fifties. Their secretary is the Mr. Frazer, whose
graphic story of Vern's hiding in the stockade days is given in a
former chapter of this work.</p>
<p>Mr. C.D. Figgis, the architect of the Mining Exchange, gives
the following description of the building that is to be completed
early in 1888:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The site has a frontage of 66 feet to Lydiard street,
by a depth of 180 feet towards Camp street, and being irregular
in plan will have a I'ear frontage of 99 feet. The building will
be two story in height to Lydiard street for a depth of 35 feet,
behind which portion the building is one story, and consists of a
main exchange hall surrounded by offices, branching off which is
a large room for meetings of the exchange. The Lydiard street
façade upon the ground floor has four shops or office fronts, and
a broad central entrance under semicircular and elliptic arches.
A plain Tuscan cornice divides the ground from the first floor
which is pierced by nine windows in three compartments separated
with plain brick pilasters. The architrave, cornice, and window
moulds will be in stucco, and between the balustrading of the
windows and the top of the pilasters black polished bricks will
be used, tuckpointed with white joints. The style is adapted
modern Italian, and the upper portion of the façade is simple in
character and surmounted with a bold cornice and open
balustrading. A paved vestibule leads from Lydiard street to the
Exchange, which measures 126 by 37½ feet. There will also be an
entrance from Camp street, and another from the Police Camp lane.
The roof will be of iron, elliptical, and there will be
semi-circular cleristory lights on three sides. The floor will be
of asphalt. Mr. W. Robertson is the contractor, and the tender
for £4007 does not include lime and other things, whose cost will
probably bring the total near £5000. Mr. Trembath is clerk of
works.</blockquote>
<p>Some of the members of the Stock Exchange have helped to make
history in the Ballarat district. The fancies of dealers in scrip
are lively, and it may be pleasant to them to be reminded that
their new home now building will cover historical ground. The
Exchange site includes that of Raffaello's "lousy logs", and also
the yard where Captain Thomas mustered his little army soon after
midnight for the march upon the Eureka Stockade at the following
dawn. Meditations among the tombs of the dead past, however, will
not be so fascinating to the mercurial manipulators of scrip as
the golden light about a spot in the heart of oldest Ballarat,
midway between their new home now building and the Stockade site.
For, at the bright spot in question, the Sulieman Pasha Company
has just (4th July) proved a new lode to be worth near 3 oz. to
the ton, and the stock has "boomed" the market for an aggregate
advance of over £30,000 in one week.</p>
<p>Electric telegraph communication was first had between
Ballarat and Melbourne on the second anniversary of the Eureka
Stockade action. The <i>Ballarat Star</i> of Tuesday, the 4th of
December, 1856, contained the following announcement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The first telegraphic communication between Ballarat
and Melbourne, and <i>vice versa</i>, took place yesterday
afternoon at twenty minutes past three o'clock. Last evening,
about eight o'clock, the representatives of the Press on Ballarat
were invited by Mr. M'Gowan to witness the working of the
telegraph. There being no office accommodation ready at present,
the spot selected was the last post near the Unicorn hotel on the
Township. A wire was carried from the post to a small testing
machine placed on a stump at its base, and thence, to secure
moisture, carried to the stream adjoining, which runs from Bath's
claim [now Cobb's corner]. Mr. Humffray, who was at the Melbourne
station, transmitted the following remarks to Mr.
M'Gowan&mdash;"The establishment of electric telegraph
communication between Ballarat and Melbourne is a far more
pleasing event to celebrate on the anniversary of the 3rd of
December than stockades and massacres."
<p>Intelligence of the bestowal of knighthood upon Mr. Ronalds,
the inventor of the telegraph in England, led to the publication
of the fact that the Mr. Ronalds referred to was the In-other of
Mr. Ronalds, who once had the Wendouree Nursery, in Ballarat, and
who was also a man of considerable attainments. Several nephews
of the inventor were lately in the colony.</p>

<p>The official records of the Ballarat Lands Office give 26 '66
inches as the average local rainfall for the 26 years, 1857-1884.
The mean temperature, calculated over the same period, was, for

<p>The telephone was introduced in Ballarat by the Victorian
Telephone Exchange Company, Limited, in February, 1883. The
office is in Lydiard street, and there was at the end of June,
1887, a subscription roll of 176, Mr. James Oddie having been the
first subscriber enrolled. This roll involves an apparatus of 200
lines, each subscriber paying £10 a year for a service extending
within a radius of one mile from the Post-office. The company was
at first known as the Melbourne Company, and began work in
Melbourne in 1880, a branch having been opened in Sandhurst soon
after the Ballarat one was started.</p>
<p>In the realm of science Ballarat has become of world-wide fame
through the inventions by Mr. Henry Sutton, a native of the
place. His skill and acquirements in electricity, telegraphy,
telephony, photography, and also in astronomical and
microscopical studies have won for him a high position as a
practical scientist, and the credit is the greater as he is a
self-taught student. But, doubtless, the scientist is born as
well as made, and if Mr. Sutton did not in the succulent days of
infancy actually lisp in occult phrases of science, it is clear
that his genius for experiment developed early, and that it was
fostered by still earlier and persistent study. Gifted with a
good memory, and the stimulus of the fervid spirit of science,
Mr. Sutton, before he was 14 years old, had read every book on
science to be found in the library of the Ballarat Mechanics'
Institute, and since then he has kept up the perusal of all the
prominent scientific journals, and all the patent records in
<em>Engineer</em> and <em>Engineering</em>. Besides this, he won
a silver medal and 30 other prizes for drawing in the School of
Design. At the age of 14 he designed completely what is now known
as the Gramme dynamo electric machine. That machine caused the
first revolution in the generation of electricity, and if Mr.
Sutton had then had the means he would have forestalled Gramme in
the publication of the invention. When Bell announced the
invention of the telephone, Mr. Sutton devised in the first year
thereafter no fewer than 20 odd different telephones, 16 of which
were patented by other people after the date of his inventions;
and there was only a space of 16 days between Sutton's discovery
of carton filament, as used in the present electric lamps, and
the discovery by Edison, as Mr. Ellery, the Victorian Astronomer
Royal, can testify. Then, the Sutton air pump is thus referred to
by the <i>English Mechanic</i> of the 21st July, 1882:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>On page 34 will be found one of the simplest and best
of mercurial air pumps, not only for the purposes of the
electrical lamp maker, but also for all purposes where a high
degree of vacuum is required to be produced. A reference to page
34, No. 886, will give the reader a good idea of the principle of
all mercurial air pumps, and will introduce him to one of the
simplest, and, we believe, the most efficient. In Mr. Sutton's
air pump, there illustrated, the mercury is caused to rise into
the globe by the action of a force pump, and it is obvious that
the operations can be performed very rapidly.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Sutton devised also a vacuum pump, worked by a water jet,
and it is in daily use now at the Ballarat School of Mines for
chemical purposes. In 1877, at the invitation of the secretary of
Æronautical Society of Great Britain, he wrote two papers on the
flight of birds, detailing experiments and deductions in that
branch of study, and the secretary acknowledged that Mr. Sutton
had discovered the true theory. Some 70 pages of the society's
report for 1878 are occupied with the Sutton papers and drawings
as designed by the writer of the papers. Mr. Sutton has
contributed articles to the Royal Societies of London and
Victoria, and has several times been invited to write papers for
the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians of London. He
is an associate of that society, and a member of the Royal
Society of Victoria, and he has been invited by M. Clocheary, a
member of the French Government, to become a member of the
<i>Societe Internationalle</i>, whose roll of members includes
the most distinguished electricians in the world. But that which
has been, perhaps, more gratifying than anything else to this
gifted and indefatigable young Ballarat scientist, is the
appreciatory reception given by the Royal Society of England to
his new electrical storage battery. The proceedings of that body,
No. 217, for the year 1881, contains a paper by Mr. Sutton,
describing his invention as a mode of storing electric force so
that "it may be drawn off equally and regularly, and this whether
the generator be on or off." The description is too elaborate and
too abstruse for a place in these pages, but we may make the
following brief extract:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The cell, having a negative electrode of copper, a
positive electrode of lead amalgamated with mercury, and a
solution of cupric sulphate, I have adopted as a thoroughly
economical, lasting, and practical form of storage reservoir. The
chemical changes in this cell are exceedingly interesting and
beautiful.
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;
The power of this cell is very great and very constant; it can be
made to last for hours, the time being dependent on the quantity
of cupric sulphate decomposed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;
It will be seen from the foregoing that this method of conserving
energy has a wide field before it, and as it will benefit fellow
workers in science, placing in their hands a means of
experimenting with powerful electric currents, I give it without
reservation, freely and untrammelled by patent rights, for their
use.</blockquote>
<p>This is large liberality, and bespeaks the disinterested
enthusiast in science. The president of the Royal Society, Mr. W.
Spottiswoode, writing to Mr. Sutton on the 4th January, 1882,
acknowledges a second paper with diagram of the cell, and says,
"Your former communication created much interest among our
fellows. I hope soon to send you printed copies of it." The
<i>Mechanic</i> says, "The methods named as those of Monsieur J
Rousse are all embraced in Mr. Sutton's, but the great advantage
in Mr. Sutton's storage battery is that the speed of the
discharge can be regulated at will, a quality which none other
known possesses. Mr. Sutton's inventions are appreciated in the
very home of scientists, and this is proof positive of their
value." <i>Iron</i>, another English journal, says, "Mr. Sutton's
invention is pronounced invaluable, and on no less an authority
than Mr. J.W. Swan, of electric lighting fame." <i>Iron</i> thus
cites Mr. Swan in evidence as follows:&mdash;"I can fully confirm
Mr. Sutton's statement as to the facility with which a thick
crust of peroxide formed on the mercurialised lead in his cell,
giving it a greater capacity for storage. The discovery of this
means of rapidly forming a thick coating of peroxide is
invaluable."</p>
<p>This Ballarat scientist, then, born in Ballarat on the 3rd
September, 1856, has, by his own unaided studies, won the
recognition of the first men of science in the world. But,
<i>nihil sine labore</i>. <a name="FNanchor_31" id=
"FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#fn31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> It is
the enthusiast who wins&mdash;if he have the necessary other
gifts. And this is no celibate ascetic, scorning social delights,
for, though a tireless worker, Mr. Sutton is a benedict, and it
is to be devoutly hoped that his wife shares adequately in the
enthusiasm of scientific research. He is to-day working in
original paths as zealously as ever, and seldom retires before 2
o'clock a.m., very often not till 3 o'clock, daylight sometimes
surprising him every morning for a week before he can cry, "Hold,
enough!" and he therefore! proclaims the theory that "eight
hours' work won't lift a man in this world." He has lately been
engaged in perfecting what promises to be a very valuable process
of engraving by the aid of photography, but the results will not
be published until the process is perfected. Another series of
experiments is in course of making for the production of
photographs in colors. But, greater marvel still, in some sense,
Mr. Sutton has designed, but not yet constructed, an apparatus by
which he hopes to be able to see here in Ballarat, by the aid of
electricity, the race for the Melbourne Cup. The author
congratulates Mr. Sutton on his being a native of Ballarat in
these years of grace, for such startling commerce with the occult
arts as the things done and doing reveal would, surely, have won
for the worker a very different fame "in the ages of faith". That
a young man, who left school at 12, should, before he was 30,
have won such fame as a student and inventor, and <i>mirabile
dictu</i>, <a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href=
"#fn32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> be acknowledged here in his own
home by such men as Professor Andrews and Mr. Ellery as one of
the best lecturers at the School of Mines, is a proof that genius
is above the restrictions of relatively narrow circumstances, and
does not wait upon universities or professional chairs for leave
to conquer the recondite secrets of science and make a place for
itself in the foremost ranks of the scientifically illustrious.
Such a worker as Henry Sutton is, may plead on virtue's side
against a vicious mass of base and brutal "larrikin" lust and
indolence&mdash;against a city full of vain inanities and the
growing passion for endless amusement, and strident, unmannerly
irreverence and display. This reverent student of nature is so
quiet and so modest, as well as so laborious and so gifted, that
he will be almost angry with the author for thus setting him out
in these pages as a reproach to the idle, the ignorant, and the
rude; and as an example to encourage other of our native youth to
rise to similar levels of serene and lofty pleasures, pregnant
with practical blessing to the world.</p>
<p>Ballarat journalism, through all the changes of the place, has
borne its full share in the expression and direction of public
opinion in the colony, and in that respect has been
representative of the political activity of the local
electorates. If the common editorial omniscience in attacking all
questions, earthly and heavenly, has not been gifted with the
creative and evolving touch of genius, and if recent editorials
have lacked some of the scholarly touches of earlier days, they
have also been free from the incoherent hysterics which were,
sometimes, the wonder of the early fifties, and they have had
none of the approaches to Eatanswill personalities which marked,
upon occasion, the sixties and seventies. The acuter and better
reasoned criticisms of things, dramatic and literary, which now
and then adorned the columns of the late fifties and sixties,
have now no equal. Such essays are not now attempted. In their
place have come benevolent or merely formal notices, and, for the
most part, they are of monotonous pattern. There are also
depressing copies of paragraphed American humor, and, by way of
corruption of pure English, the regular use of the slang of
police lockups and other places. The old order gives place to the
new, and new readers and new writers have entered the arena of
affairs. They are, or will be, for the most part Australian born,
racy or rancid of the soil, and, no doubt, reciprocally
interpretative. But, for the present, whether it be that
editorial writers have grown mellower, wiser, or more careless,
it is certain that Mr. Westgarth would not now find his old
entertainment in local editorials; and though the quondam
lecturer, now Sir Archibald Michie, Q.C., might still find in
local press work proofs of his theory that press writers are
generally gentlemen of defective education, the Swinburnian
verdict on some other offenders, that their products are examples
of the "blatant audacity of immedicable ignorance", will seldom
be applicable to Ballarat journalists.</p>
<p>Since Prince Alfred, then captain of the Galatea, made his
joyous entry on the 9th of December, 1867, and had three days of
levees, feasts, dances, visits, processions, addresses, and what
not, there came in July, 1881, the royal lads, Albert Victor and
George of Wales, midshipmen under the care of Admiral Earl
Clanwilliam, his Excellency the Marquis of Normanby being also of
the party. The visitors were duly banqueted by Mayor Robert
Lewis, of the city, and Mayor William Robertson, of the town, and
saw the more notable sights. Besides these Royal and Vice-royal
people, there have come peers and commoners, more or less
illustrious, from the old world. To wit, Anthony Trollope, the
novelist; Froude, the historian; Proctor, the astronomer; Gerald
Massey, the poet; one of the American generals Sheridan; Forbes,
Sala, and Phil. Robinson, the war correspondents; and Dr. Cameron
Lees, with his Balmoral order of the Thistle, as a royal chaplain
and a representative Scottish Presbyterian. Proctor, Massey,
Sheridan, Forbes, Sala and Robinson all delivered lectures in
Ballarat, on the several matters in which they had won fame. Of
peers there were many. Lord and Lady Brassey, of the "Sunbeam",
who came with their children in June last, being the latest of
that order. The Duke of Manchester was one of the first. After
him, in June, 188-5, came Lord Lymington, eldest son of the Earl
of Portsmouth, and on the 30th March last the Earl and Countess
Aberdeen and Lord Sandhurst, and with Lord Sandhurst came Sir
Henry Wrenfordsly, ex-Chief Justice of West Australia and Fiji.
On the 1st April last he was admitted to practise at the
Victorian bar. These last two came as guests of Sir W.J. Clarke,
on a visit to his Dowling Forest Estate, where they were all
entertained by Mr. G.G. Morton, of Labona, and very complimentary
things were exchanged between landlord, visitors, and tenants.
For the latter, the spokesman was James M'Intosh, of Myrtle Grove
Farm, who propounded as a cure for Irish disorder the giving of
an estate in Tipperary to Sir W.J. Clarke, who should deal with
tenants there as at Dowling Forest, and that the Government
should deport all disloyal prelates, priests, and laymen to
Siberia "to learn moderation and toleration." Whilst these happy
interchanges were going on at Dowling Forest amid plentiful
hospitalities, some leading Home Rule Irishmen were presenting an
address of welcome to Lord and Lady Aberdeen at Craig's hotel,
after the Earl and Countess had been to see the mine and works of
the Band and Albion Consols Company. The address expressed
gratitude for the manner in which the Earl and Countess had shown
their interest in the welfare of Ireland during the Earl's
Lord-Lieutenancy, and asked the Countess to accept a 4oz. nugget
of Ballarat (Carngham alluvial) gold. One of the peculiarities of
the presentation was that Father Rogers (who took a leading part
in the welcome, and hoped for Home Rule for Ireland and a second
term of office for the Earl), and W.M. Acheson, who read the
address, as well as some others of the welcomers, came within the
category of those of whom Michael Davitt said last year,
according to a statement in the <i>Pall Mall
Gazette</i>&mdash;"They are not Irish, they are only English and
Scotch who are settled among us." But Davitt referred specially
to Ulster Orangemen, and Father Rogers and some co-"settlers"
were hardly of that clan at any rate. The Earl's reception was
very cordial, and his responses to the honors paid to him and his
Countess were at once manly and modest. It is rememberable that
though this Scotch Earl, as one of Mr. Gladstone's subalterns,
received these courtesies, the English Lord Lymington, whose
papers in one of the London fortnightly reviews a year or two
before on "The Portsmouth System" in Ireland, showed that the
M'Intosh theory of cure had in part been successfully anticipated
and applied there, came and went without any recognition by
either Irishmen or Davitt "settlers". But then the Englishman had
held no office, and was here but a private visitor. He was only a
Wallop, whose ancestors before the Heptarchy, mayhap," drank
potent <i>waes haels</i> <a name="FNanchor_33" id=
"FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#fn33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> at
Celtic Caergwent, killed and ate boars in the beech and oak
forests about Upper and Nether Wallop, and took speckled trout
from the little streams of the Hurstbournes, Tarrant and Priors,
whose head waters run among the chalk slopes towards the Vale of
White Horse on the one hand, while on the other the sister
rivulet took its way down the fat vales, chalk-bounded, of
north-eastern Hants. His, and his ancestors' home, was in old
Wessex. An Englishman of the English he, with his tall, gaunt
form, and his Saxon hair. As were Englishmen,
too&mdash;<i>pace</i> <a name="FNanchor_34" id=
"FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#fn34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Michael Davitt&mdash;Wolesley,
Wesley&mdash;Wellesley&mdash;Wellington, this last a very typical
Englishman even, as was his great or greater namesake, John
Wesley. As were, and are also, perchance, the Wasleys, who
discovered the Al lead here in Ballarat, and the younger
Australian born one who, the other day, son of a mining manager
here, won the top and final honor in laws at the Melbourne
University, coming off with his B.A. and his LL.B., and a
scholarship of £75. How the links of race, geography, history,
development, touch us as we go along, and how small the globe
seems. Doubtless Davitt, from an aboriginal Irish point of view,
was theoretically and racially right in marking the bar immigrant
in the Irish escutcheons he pointed at. Here, too, at the
antipodes we are brought face to face with the facts of
difference and commixture. Here we mix more and more into one
indivisible people; but the process began ages ago on the other
side of the world. Those Wallops touched, territorially, on the
west the Celtic and prehistoric Stonehenge and the Vale of White
Horse. On the east they hunted towards the Strathfieldsaye won by
Wellington from the grateful empire he had served or saved, and
his domain hedged the vanished Romans' buried Silchester. The
centuries with their changes have been weaving us all
together&mdash;Celt, Roman, Dane, Saxon, Norman&mdash;have woven
us in part together, and which is warp and which woof who will
say? Surely it is better to respect the web thus woven and
weaving than to rip it in pieces with our paltry Popkins
questions of dividing peoples.</p>
<p>In the fragments of hours which the writer has spent amongst
old newspaper files he has felt as if making a pilgrimage, after
a long absence, through an old burial ground. "The years that are
fled knock at the door and enter." The local dead have been
continually before him, but speaking or acting in some of the
many affairs of life. The vehemence of speech and intense
interest and vitality of action over what, seen in the present
distance, seem to be matters narrow and trivial, contrast
strangely and instructively with the silence of the now departed
actors and talkers. Names forgotten&mdash;names even of
acquaintances and friends&mdash;are recorded on these yellowing
and fragile sheets, and as they re-appear, one by one, they
almost startle sometimes by the rush of many memories which they
produce. To a newspaper writer it is similar, but more solemn,
less merely curious, than the sudden meeting, in some strange
journal printed, it may be, thousands of miles away, a paragraph
from his own pen, and quoted from paper to paper till it has
reached the far distance and comes back again upon him by some
chance of affairs as an old but forgotten face, with features
sometimes distorted by violent handling or worn by attrition of
time and change. This is like a sudden note of music or odor of a
flower recalling a past hour: the other is like the loud re
echoing of thunder among the hills when the listener had thought
the last far-off reverberation had for ever died away. The first
sonorous burst which awed him by its grandeur seems then to be
heard again, and the first emotions are re-awakened. Such is the
power that lies in these dry records which the printer's art has
preserved, and such the seeming remoteness of the yet near past
in the swift evolutions of events in a young and growing and
active colonial settlement.</p>
<p>The great spectacle presented to the eye of the visitor in
these days is marked, to the inner eye of the old resident, with
many deeply graved lines of toil and trouble. Many a man has
fought on bravely, year after year, against rocks, drifts,
floodings, poverty, and almost despair. Not quite despair,
however, for else all had been lost. There was still hope that at
last gold would be reached, and that hope and his own native
courage and independence have made to the miner the dry crust,
the drink from the often-watered tea-leaves, the narrow cheerless
tent, general privations, and sometimes sickness, the experience
of long periods. Such were some of the men, such the pluck that
created this city. Many of them obtained industrial victory, but
many more only had "the consciousness of battle, and the resolve
to persevere therein while life or faculty is left." And many
fell, as is the miner's too frequent lot, victims to foul air,
treacherous earth-slips, water-bursts, personal recklessness, and
mine-engendered diseases.</p>
<p>Any one of the diggers of 1851 or 1852 who looks now upon this
city cannot fail to reflect on the contrast of the present and
the past. To those who have remained here during all the
intervening years the growth and transformation of the place have
seemed less magical than to others, for they have been like those
who witness the progress of their children from infancy to youth
and manhood. The progress has been seen, but it has been only at
special moments that the mind has grasped the fact that the child
has disappeared and a man has taken the vacated place. There has
come a day when the mind has, by some quick process of projection
upon the past, brought it into line with the present, and then
the little child looks out from the larger, soberer, countenance
of the man. It is only for a moment, and then the younger vision
disappears, save to the peering sight of memory that follows
sadly, and clings lovingly to the fairer and fresher form that
will not stay but retreats, with ever increasing velocity, as the
new realities and duller cares of the present crowd in upon the
mind. So with the old digger now as he walks about these spacious
gas-lit streets, where he no longer needs the candle in the
broken bottle as a lantern after dark, but where every
thoroughfare is adorned with crowding edifices, and is glittering
with the blaze of a more artificial life, and the results of
accumulated wealth. As he looks, there come moments when all the
scene dissolves into its original elements. Through all the
rattle of street strife, over all the display of churches,
towers, halls, and noisy warehouses, his eyes see something and
his ears hear something invisible and inaudible to others. Over
all the array of aggregated civic opulence and beauty, and its
dark shadows of want and haggard strife for bread, there steal to
him the silence of the beginning, a few white tents among the
forest trees that are no more, the half-dozen columns of curling
smoke from the camp fires, the round, oval, and square pits of
the shallow-ground digger, the scanty patches of newly turned up
golden soil. The fresh breeze, that came over the old silent
odorous bush and its reaches of grass-land, breathes upon him
again instead of the noisome exhalations from the gutters and
sewers and by-ways of the thickly peopled town. In another moment
that scene, too, glides past. He is in an absorbing series of
mutations. The past moves along before him like a panorama in
which every scene quickens the vision with the light of familiar
sights and the warmth of pleasant memories. Streets of tents and
shingle houses now stretch out in sinuous lines. They wind among
hillocks of dirt and scant bush, upon the slopes and the flats
and the hill-tops. Merry crowds of men work briskly at windlass
and cradle and puddling-tub, and others ply the many trades and
callings which the increased multitude have demanded with their
gold, their fancies, and their necessities. Then night comes with
its glittering camp fires, the crashing of felled trees, the
discharges of multitudinous firearms, the song from tent and
windlass the laughter of the lucky or the careless, the music
from the dancing saloon, the oath of the profane, the ribaldry of
the drunken, the solemn, or jubilant, but sacred hymn of those
who in that way worship God. As he sits by the lessening light of
his fire, with the pungent aroma of the grass-tree and the
peppermint in the air about him, the gazer sees still other
visions. In such moments, as our Australian Kendall has
said&mdash;</p>
<div class="quote" style="margin-left:15%;">The phantom of his
youth is apt to come,<br>
And flit before him as he sits alone,<br>
And float about him like a fitful dream,<br>
A sweet sad light amidst the gathering gloom.</div>
<p>He wearies at last and enters his tent. By the flickering
light of the decaying embers of the open-air fire he fastens his
canvas door, lies down upon his mattrass of gum-leaves, or grass,
or straw, and is soon in dreamland. He awakes to find it was,
indeed, but a passing vision of what once was where this
wide-reaching city now spreads out its arms and rears its
"tower-encircled head". All is changed, save the "everlasting
hills" by day and the eternal procession of the stars by night,
and all has come about by the enterprising industry evoked by the
unconquerable love of gold.</p>
<p>The same power operates now as in the earlier days. The
working miner, with his pinched, weary, wan visage, his little
bundle of food, and his billy of tea, going along the paved
streets at midnight, past stately houses of business and luxury,
to his dreary dirty labor below ground, and the jovial
cigar-smoking well-fed speculator at the Corner in the broad
noon-time are aiming at similar ends, though both, by sore stress
of changed conditions, are now forced to indulge in less
brilliant expectations. Both men aim at that which every shaft,
every engine, every pile of stones or waste of mullock and
sludge, as well as every office and shop and field
reveals&mdash;the desire of domestic comfort, the means of
personal gratification, or the ability to give happiness to
others. Amidst all the mutations of the outward and visible the
inward and invisible impulse remains the same.</p>
<p>Everything indicates one resistless force and points to one
humble pioneer.</p>
<p>It is not our purpose to enquire what might have been the
future of this locality, or of the colony, had the quiet and
comparative solitude of pastoral settlement not been broken in
upon by the gold discovery with its sequent hordes of population,
and all their busy and creative industry. To those who come after
us we shall appear as pioneers. We, looking back to that which,
in the swift evolution of events in this place, seems to us a
distant past, think of the still earlier pioneers whom we
followed hither. And as we look we connect what they did with the
yet unrevealed future of the colony. The gold-digger's work must
ever be a factor in the great sum of Australian history. It is
not all, certainly, and its relative value must decline. But,
across the many-threaded tissue of our young national life, the
wealth, and enterprise, and influence of the gold-fields run in a
bright broad band of gold; and, in the far-off future, the
historical student, when he searches among the foundation-stones
of empire here, will find the base of one of the strongest
columns of national greatness inscribed with the names of the
golden cities of Victoria, and, first of all, the name of the
first and the richest&mdash;Ballarat.</p>
<p>In looking at these wide-spreading streets and thickly
clustering dwellings, at these green and beautiful oases of
flowers and trees, at the far-reaching, well-tilled fertile
lands, that lend their ornamentation to the general landscape,
the thoughtful spectator naturally asks what it all signifies.
Truly it is the outcome of the plodding thought of Esmond as he
walked among the sierras of California and remembered the home he
had left in Victoria. This three-boroughed city means,
reflectively, a reminiscence and a hope lighting up the mind of
that quiet gold hunter, and, more remotely, of alcadi Hargreaves
also, as he sat in judgment upon delinquent diggers, or peered
with questioning eye through the Golden Gate of the Pacific,
Australia ward, and saw as in a vision the golden glory of his
late home rising like Aurora, radiant with light and beauty. It
is but true that every field of yellow grain, every tree in our
orchards that bends beneath its golden fruitage, every flower
that waves its odorous beauty in our gardens, every line of grace
and elegance in our stately piles of architecture, speaks of one
pioneer. Every demonstration of our civilisation, from the tall
temples of religion to the costly shrines of literature and art
and the richly stored houses of commerce, from the glittering
carriages and the rustling silks of the luxurious rich to the
crowding hosts that fight the daily battle of life's hard labor
for bread, all is but a homage to the enterprise of Esmond, of
Clunes, and his immediate followers, the discoverers of this the
first and the richest of the gold-fields, and the battle ground
of the political freedom of Victoria.</p>

illustrations of the volume, a general revival in mining business
has arisen, which promises much good for this city and district.
Mr. Allan's map, which is, really, one of the most striking
illustrations of the book, is also a very opportune pictorial
record of the present physical aspect of mining here. It is the
completest map of the Ballarat mines ever prepared. Close upon
forty-five square miles of ground are there depicted, ground
industrially famous in the annals of Australian mining; for it
includes the first and richest of all great alluvial centres on
this continent, and the site of the younger and now important
quartz mines of the Ballarat and Buninyong divisions of the
district. The map is, also, a proof of the complete revolution
which has taken place in local mining. More than a hundred claims
are shown by Mr. Allan, spread over the very centre and borders
of the famous alluvial territory of the Ballarat basin and its
contiguous valleys, but there is not a single alluvial claim in
all this carefully measured and recorded series of mines. Thus
completely has vanished the original form of Ballarat mining, and
the one which roused the whole of these colonies from their
antecedent dullness to a new life, and drew from all parts of the
world the sturdy gold-hunters whose doings have in part been
noted in the body of this book. The Ballarat basin, into which
and out of which flowed the ancient auriferous gutters, is a
hollow in the Great Divide, which stretches irregularly west by
north across the colony from the greater Cordillera, which is the
backbone of the continent, and reaches from the Gulf of
Carpentaria to Cape Howe. The schistose rocks of the Divide are
interlaced with lodes of gold-bearing quartz, and the alluvial
gutters and reef-washes which the earlier diggers worked were
parts of the <i>débris</i> of the denuded rocks that once towered
high above the highest of existing levels on the ranges of
to-day. Successive denudations and successive volcanic overflows
during incalculable ages have respectively created and covered
the various alluvial deposits during what geologists tell us were
the pliocene and miocene periods; and the peculiarity of the
Ballarat basin and its contiguous deposits is the fact that they
occur where the forces of those geologic times broke down a
portion of the western face of the ranges, and made a clean gap
in the mountain spur. The volume of golden detritus was thus
immense, and the deposits of the precious metal answerably large
and rich. But all these auriferous deposits were the product of
the quartz lodes which lay in the silurian rocks of the ranges,
and thereby hangs the golden and industrial tale of to-day's
quartz mining in this gold-field.</p>
<p>A glance at the map will discover a multiplicity of short red
lines, black-edged, and all running in a similar direction,
namely, from north to south. Those lines indicate the known
quartz lodes, and the strike of them all is, roughly stated, from
a little west of north to a little east of south. That is the
feature of the main lodes, and their underlie is to the west, but
spurs, shoots, droppers, and so forth, occur in all directions;
those of them which are found on the east side of the lode-walls
being invariably the richer in the precious metal, the bulk of
the gold in many cases being obtained from relatively small
masses of quartz. A width of country four or five miles broad is
thus gridironed with lodes, the matrices of the gold which filled
our gutters, spread nuggets and reef-washes over the sides of the
ancient valleys, or still awaits the extracting arts of the
modern quartz miner.</p>
<p>Very early after the gold discovery in 1851, there were rude
and isolated essays in quartz mining, but it was not till the
bulk of the alluvial deposits had been exhausted that anything
like systematic quartz mining set in. The alluvial digger had now
and then broken through gold-bearing quartz lodes whilst
following or searching after the gutters, but the first attempts
at quartz mining were made where the quartz outcropped in the
ranges, and thus Dr. Otway and the Port Phillip Co. at the Black
Hill, some others about the Little Bendigo and adjacent gullies,
and Kaulbach on Old Post Office Hill, began to demonstrate the
important fact that the cataclysms or the slower action of the
geologic ages had not robbed the rocks of all their gold. The
author well remembers seeing, some thirty years ago, Kaulbach's
little party knocking out bright specimens of virgin gold in
quartz as the men were opening their first shaft. They were only
down about three feet then where now there is a great chasm
formed by the subsidences of the mining of the after years. The
recent brilliant finds along the deeper depths of the Indicator
line were more valuable, but not purer or brighter than those all
but surface specimens from Kaulbach's shaft. The deeper
discoveries of the more modern workers have been in larger bulk,
hundreds of ounces of virgin gold being found in bunches of
quartz hinged together, as it were, by the pure, precious metal.
There were discouraging theories set about by some of the
geological savants at first, to the effect that most, if not all,
the gold was in the upper portions of the lodes, that the rich
alluvial gutters were an indication of that fact, and that it
would not pay to go to the expense of seeking profitable results
in deep quartz mining. But that theory is now pretty well
exploded. The splendid discoveries made at Sandhurst at deeper
levels than the deepest yet reached in Ballarat, as well as some
finds at Stawell, have proved that the lodes do pay at great
depths, and have raised the question whether or not still deeper
levels will yield still richer results.</p>
<p>Ballarat, whose larger and richer alluvial deposits took a
longer time to exhaust than those of other fields, is only a
young beginner, so to speak, in quartz mining as a systematised
industry, Clunes, Sandhurst, Stawell, were all earlier at work in
that sense, but this centre is now a quartz centre, and it is
steadily testing the issue&mdash;will deep quartz mining pay, or
will it not pay? For some years quartz mines have been paying
along the belt of lodes which traverse the eastern portion of
Ballarat, and more recently the western belt beneath the plateau
of West Ballarat and Sebastopol has been invested, and with
gratifying success. This later success is the more notable, as
deeper levels have been reached there than in the east, and the
richest quartz has, in some instances, been found at the lowest
depths. But this success on the western plateau is also an
incentive to renewed enterprise in the east, or might have been,
had there not occurred along the eastern belt of lodes successes
enough to stimulate to fresh exertions and create a stronger
faith in the value and permanency of the lodes there. The mining
revival here is, doubtless, due to a variety of concurring
causes, in which the reduction of the bank rates of interest on
deposits may count for one, and may help to prolong the renewed
output of mining energy; but the substantial discoveries along
the strike of the Indicator, the better fortunes of the Sulieman
Pasha in discovering good gold in the Pasha or Danish lode, and
the excellent promise in the mines on the plateau, must be taken
to be the more positive causes in operation. The rise of £36,000
in the aggregate value of the Sulieman Pasha stock in a space of
14 days in August has not, indeed, been sustained, but a
substantial advance has been maintained, and in the same period
some nine or ten stocks in Ballarat rose near £70,000 in
aggregate value; whilst a host of other stocks in this and
adjacent districts, but mostly held and managed here, have
partaken in the general advance. It is always the case in the
history of our mining revivals, that the rush of speculators to
the share market prompts to a rush of promoters of new ventures,
and the market soon gets flooded with new stocks, good, bad, and
indifferent, till the supply exceeds the demand, and a lull
ensues. This has already come in the current revival, and that it
has come thus early is a matter of satisfaction, inasmuch as it
will tend to arrest the launching of new claims, prevent the
accumulation of merely bogus prospectuses, hold the fervor of
speculation within safer limits, and so far save the district
from a recurrence of those disastrous collapses which haves too
often been the bane of mining revivals on the goldfields. In the
meantime good is done. The revival itself is not without solid
cause at the start, for the actual discovery of fresh gold, or
the immediate prospect of it, gives the initial impulse; and
though, as the movement gathers force, excesses may be committed,
there is bound to be some solid residuum of profit in the
development of mines already in existence, and in the opening of
fresh ground to the pick of the miner.</p>
<p>The accompanying map of the Ballarat mines gives at a glance a
view of a large field already in active work, and the work done
is but as the mere scratching of the surface compared with what
remains to be achieved. For although on the western belt of lodes
the Band and Albion Consols Company has reached a level of 1400
feet below the surface, and the Star of the East Company a level
of 1280 feet, both in paying ground, the bulk of the mines on the
eastern belt of lodes have not reached a depth of 500 feet, and
this in spite of the greater nearness of that belt to the centre
of the auriferous formation, and of the sources of the grand
alluvial gutters of the early days of mining in Ballarat. True,
as to levels, the difference between the eastern and western
mines is not so great in relation to sea level as appears in the
figures stated, since a large number of the eastern mines have
their surface below that of the western ones; but after making
allowance for that, the fact remains that the eastern mines
generally have only reached shallower depths, and have, in all
probability, as have also the western ones, golden resources
whose profitable exploration will be the work of many generations
of miners. No fewer than between 30 and 40 lodes strike through
the two belts&mdash;as many as that have already been
discovered&mdash;and the diamond drill has proved gold in
Ballarat East at more than double the depth yet reached in any
mine on that belt of lodes. The more famous, because most proved,
of the eastern lodes are the Indicator 1 and 2, Majestic,
Scandinavian, Western Slates, Rothschild, Danish, Ribbon Slates,
Sulieman Pasha, Pug, Fire Brigade, Oregon, Yorkshire, Old Post
Office, Llanberris, Promised Land, Temperance, Monte Christo. The
Temperance, at Little Bendigo, is said to be probably the most
true and perfect lode in Victoria, as to its solid regularity and
continuity of strike and underlie, barring, of course, the
occurrence of crosscourses. But even they only shift the site of
the lode; they do not change its quality of permanence and
regularity. Looking, then, at the fact that the relatively deep
mines of the western plateau are proving good gold-bearing lodes,
that the older and shallower mines on the eastern belt are now
paying better as they go deeper, and that the diamond drill has
brought gold from depths below the deepest yet reached by the
miner with his pick on either belt of lodes, it is clear that
good warrant exists for a revival of enterprise that shall be not
a mere spurt of transient market speculation, but a steady, and
lasting, and increasingly profitable development of local
resources.</p>
<p>This is how the author regards the present revival, in spite
of its share in the customary alloy of febrile speculation, and
its occasional symptoms of bogus enterprise. And there is this
great consolation to local observers of the movement, that the
revival is mainly one of purely local application. In past times
Ballarat adventure has too often spent its capital like rain upon
distant places, and met with no adequate return, and often with
only disastrous loss; but now we have a revival at our own doors,
open to local criticism and, best thing of all, inspired by local
successes. Happily, too, this has come about whilst there remains
most of the well-proven band of enterprising capitalists and
mining experts, to whose spirit of adventure and plucky disdain
of large risks this and other mining centres owe so much of their
successful development. This current revival will see prospecting
work done here where all, or the great bulk, of the fertilising
capital is found for the enterprise. The wage-fund will be
distributed at our own doors, will employ our own people, give
customers to our own tradesmen, create a multiplicity of
wholesome demands, and, let us be permitted to hope, furnish
resultant demonstration of practically inexhaustible resources in
auriferous lodes on both sides of the Yarrowee.</p>
<p>We will now make some brief reference to the several lines of
claims shown on the map before us, individualising their history
and prospects, and mentioning the more prominent of the promoters
of the various mining operations extant to-day. Comparing what
follows here with the text of the mining chapter in this book,
one or two seeming discrepancies in dates may be noticed, but
they are in reality consistent with each other for the most part,
as referring to different stages of organic development. Looking
along the eastern belt of lodes, where local quartz mining had
its beginning, we see the Llanberris claim. It is on the southern
edge of the alluvial basin, whose opening through the gap in the
Divide stretches from Golden Point to the Black Hill, and we make
it our starting point, because the Llanberris Company is the
oldest living quartz company on the whole line. As we have said.
Dr. Otway, the Port Phillip Company, and others were the first
essayists in quartz mining on the Ballarat East lodes, and it was
Mr. Thompson, an officer of the Port Phillip Company, who first,
in a report to his directors, propounded the, at that time,
incredible theory that the alluvial leads would flow from the
eastern basin out westward beneath the basaltic plateau of
Ballarat and Sebastopol. But all those earlier ventures died out,
and the Llanberris Company, formed in 1857, is now the oldest
existing organisation. Thomas Jones, of Llanberis, in old Wales,
had worked the alluvial where the quartz claim is now, and he and
others had noticed that the gutter encountered a thick high wall
of quartz there, so when the alluvial was worked out the quartz
claim was taken up. The New Enterprise Company took up the ground
next south, and won 4000oz. of gold the first year, or £16,000
worth&mdash;not 16,000oz. as is inadvertently stated in the
chapter on mining. That company then failed, the Messrs.
Learmonth taking the claim and erecting a battery and other
plant. They failed, and sold to the Llanberris Company, who
removed their working staff to the Enterprise shaft. Jones, whose
native place, plus an extra r inserted by some official
blunderer, gave the name to the claim, had six shares for
furnishing an engine and other plant. Messrs. Rowlands and Lewis
long held shares in the mine, and the management was famous for
its economy. The winnings were not brilliant for years, and yet
on averages of from 1dwt. to 4dwt. per ton paid expenses, cleared
off debts, and even paid occasional dividends. But lately the
company has shared in the richer stone of that comparatively
modern discovery, the Indicator, and has been able to pay regular
monthly dividends. The company's capital is £24,000, in 2000
shares. Mr. Theophilus Williams is the manager, Mr. W. Gale is
chairman, and his co-directors are Messrs. T. Humphrys, H. Jones,
T. Osborne, J. Hicks, O. Thomas, and the Hon. D. Ham, M.L.C. The
new impetus born of the revival has touched this company also,
and larger operations have been decided on, involving a partition
of the claim with a view to its being more thoroughly explored.
These partitions, as West Llanberris and Llanberris No. 1, but,
yesterday, inchoate formations, are now duly organised, and will,
no doubt, be soon in active operation.</p>
<p>The Indicator is a black pyritous vertical line in the slate
rock, striking, like the other lodes, north and south, thin as
the edge of a knife at times, at others thickening to some
inches; sometimes lost by crosscourse throws east or west, as all
the lodes are, but always rich in itself in gold or indicating
golden riches in the contiguous quartz, and always keeping, as do
the lodes as a whole, the north and south strike. Other lines
rich in pyrites and of similar features indicative of the
presence of gold, exist both in the eastern and western belt of
lodes, but the one specially known as The Indicator passes
through the eastern half of the Llanberris mine, and thence north
and south through the spur of the Divide to as yet unknown
distances. It has been traced in many claims on either hand, is
specially rich in nuggety virgin gold, and to its denudation in
the vanished portions of the rocks is attributed much of the
richness of the alluvial gutters of the basin.</p>
<p>The Last Chance Company, manager Mr. J. M'Whae, chairman L.L.
Meanowski, co-directors Hon. H. Gore, M.L.C., E. Morey, Hon. D.
Ham, M.L.C., and W. Irwin, was organised on the 2nd May, 1882,
capital 20,000 shares of 10s., as the successor of the older
Endeavor Company, whose venture was in the hands of Messrs.
Balhausen and Göller. They sold to a band of tributors, and with
them the existing company was formed.</p>
<p>The Britannia United Company, manager Mr. J.M. Bickett,
capital £12,000, in 24,000 shares, was organised on the 7th
March, 1887, and is the old Britannia and Major combined. The
directors are Messrs. W.H. Batten (chairman), J. Wittkowski, C M.
Watson, R. Thurling, and L.L. Roberts. The company is adding to
its plant, and is preparing to sink deeper and generally to enter
upon a completer style of operations.</p>
<p>The Victoria United is the nucleus of a newly-formed mining
combination of ventures, all the interests in which belong to a
company in whose projection Miss Alice Cornwell had a leading
part. This lady's name has been mentioned in the body of this
book, and reference will be made further on to her enterprise in
connection with this and other mining undertakings in and around
Ballarat.</p>
<p>The Sulieman and Indicator Company, capital £10,000, in 20,000
shares, is a new organisation for working the Black Hill United
mine. The manager is Mr. G. Ruffle, and the directors are Messrs.
Alex. Gilpin, W.H. Batten, J. Hardy, J. Mager, and P. M'Whae.</p>
<p>The Queen's Jubilee Company, capital £20,000, in £1 shares,
manager Mr. E.H.L. Swifte, directors the Hon. Colonel Smith,
M.L.A. (chairman), and Messrs. Alex. Gilpin, E. Morey, T.
Stoddart, Hon. J. Williamson, M.L.C., C. Seal, and D. M'Phail,
was organised on the 1st November, 1886. This company has the
deepest shaft yet sunk on the belt. It is down 782 feet now, and
the company proposes to carry it down to a depth of 1250 feet,
pent-houses and other proper safety arrangements being in use, so
as to allow of shaft sinking below the 782 feet level, whilst
stoping operations are in progress in the levels above. The
company's resolve to sink so deep is due in part to the
revelations made by the diamond drill in adjacent ground, the No.
1 bore having proved likely rock at 1000 feet, and the No. 2 bore
having cut gold-bearing quartz at over 1500 feet.</p>
<p>The Black Hill Company is the prolific parent of a large
family of claims, for that company's original territory and its
subsequent accretions have at various dates been parcelled out in
divers new ventures. The Sulieman and Indicator, born Black Hill
United, is one; Queen's Jubilee another. North and South
Sulieman, Nos. 2 and 3 Queen others. All these are not the
offspring of the present revival, but most of them share in its
advantages, and owe to it a fresh accession of energy, if not of
solid capital. The Black Hill Company, after some preliminary
operations, decided to register in 1862, with a capital of
£37,200, in £15 shares, and on the 21st January, 1881, the
present No Liability Company was completed, with a capital of
£44,640, in 14,880 shares of £3 each, of which £1 was paid-up.
The manager is Mr. J.F. Smith, and the directors are Messrs. C.
Seal (chairman), J. Hardy, E.A. and A. Wynne, and D. Cameron.
This company did most of the work in rending the Black Hill in
two, and in tunnelling its deeper levels, and its large works and
its fine battery of 60 heads made it for years the model as well
as show quartz mine of this centre. Some statistics in connection
with the company will be found in the chapter on local mining
development.</p>
<p>The claims mentioned so far all lie on the strike of the
Indicator, and the same line is presumed to exist in the Garden
Gully claim on the furthest north of the map, or, if not in it,
then the brood of new ventures mapped immediately west may have
it, though all that is conjecture at present. Turning back
southward and westward through the brood of new things, still
callow, but promising to be soon well feathered, we come to</p>
<p>The Sulieman Pasha Company's claim, within whose ground, on
the bank of the alluvial lead there, was discovered the famous
Welcome Nugget tabled in the mining chapter of this book. That
enormous mass of gold, and the rich gutter and reef-washes which
were found there, were all so many proofs of the auriferous value
of the denuded quartz lodes that once existed in the
neighbourhood, and the company's success has shown that the lodes
remaining are worth working. The Sulieman Pasha and the Danish
are the main lodes of the claim, and the recent "boom" in the
company's stock was caused by the striking of stone at a low
level in the Danish lode that produced from two to three ounces
of gold to the ton. This discovery was doubly encouraging,
inasmuch as it was at a deeper level than usual in the company's
workings, and as it showed that besides the Indicator there
existed a valuable line of lode whose future working would in all
likelihood be a permanently profitable industry. The result, so
far, has been a great change in the status of the company. In the
opening week of this year the company's stock was in 12,000
shares, and was offered at 6s. 3d. per share, without business,
but by the middle of August, after the latest of several new
hauls of gold, the company's stock, doubled to 24,000 shares,
sold as high as 60s. per share, or 120s. per original 12,000th
share. This highest rate of 60s. per share has not been
sustained, for the phenomenal output of 707oz. for the week at
the time of the highest "boom" has not been maintained, and at
the time of this writing the stock is sold at 45s., or over 80s.
for the share existing at the opening of the year. Still, the
altered position of the company is remarkable, even looking at
the weekly output of smaller sums since then, namely, 285oz.,
306oz., 324oz., as contrasted with the fortnightly yields of from
37oz. to 83½oz. during the early part of the year. It is not that
the mining revival is to be attributed to the revolution in this
company's prospects, for the causes of the revival are manifold,
and there is always a something in the air, so to speak, in
revival times, by means of which speculators are drawn from the
four winds of heaven, and the force of the movement is
accelerated. The fact is that the Sulieman Pasha Company's
success is but one of many similar successes; but it is certain
that its good fortune has had a special effect for good upon the
whole of the Ballarat East mine prospects, coupled, as it has
been, with the heavy nuggetings along the Indicator strike in the
Llanberris, Prince Regent, and North Woah Hawp mines. The
Sulieman Pasha Company has a good plant, and a new shaft on the
edge of Main street, near Humffray street, is being sunk with
good speed, and will enable the company to carry on mine
operations very effectively. The company's stock is in 24,000
shares of £1 each, and the first dividend this year (1s.) has
lately been declared. The first incorporation was on the 3rd
January, 1878, with 4000 shares of £1. That capital was in a year
or two increased to £12,000, and this year the further increase
was made as already stated. The manager is Mr. J. Curthoys, and
the directors are Messrs. Isaac Jonas (chairman), E. Murphy,
M.L.A., J. Hardy, and J. and M. Wasley. It should be recorded in
this company's honor that it repaid a £500 loan from the
Government prospecting vote some few years ago. The loan was an
instance of aid fruitfully applied, and repayment was a
phenomenon of corporate honesty.</p>
<p>A perfect cloud of Suliemans and other ventures has been
created within the last few weeks, stretching away north of the
Black Hill and away south of the parent company, but we have not
space here to refer to them in detail. The map shows their
chances in relation to the crack lodes, and the men who are
directing the undertakings are generally men at once of means and
expert knowledge. A promising discovery in the North Sulieman,
one of the Black Hill Company's offshoots, occurs at the time of
this writing, to illustrate the probabilities of ultimate
success, less or more. So we take, also, as a sample of promoting
names in these newer claims, and of public mining confidence, the
board of the South Sulieman Company, of which Mr. J. M'Whae is
the manager, and the directors Messrs. Isaac Jonas, Alex. Gilpin,
J. Murray, M. Butterly, and E.J. Carroll.</p>
<p>Reverting to the leading mines south of the Llanberris claim,
we have before us the Speedwell on the slope of the range between
the sources of the Red Hill and Canadian alluvial leads. The
ground was taken up for quartz a quarter century ago, and a good
deal of gold has been obtained thence at intervals. Not long
since the mine fell into the hands of the late Henry Costin, and
at his death it was sold to a company&mdash;syndicate is the
modern phrase&mdash;in which Miss Alice Cornwell is a
shareholder. The original claim has been added to by the purchase
of adjoining ground, and as the new proprietary will have means
to work the mine properly, and as the Indicator line is included
in the ground, there is good reason to anticipate for the new
adventurers a liberal share of the success to which their
enterprise will entitle them.</p>
<p>The southern boundary of the Speedwell mine brings us to the
Sovereign Hill, so named from a company that 15 or 20 years ago
was subsidised by local subscription for the purpose of sinking a
shaft 1000 feet to test the value of our lodes at that depth. At
that time the experiment was regarded as an almost wonderful
effort, and it certainly was a plucky conception, not to say
sagacious withal, for miners here had not then learnt the
profitableness of our lodes at even greater depths than that.
Financial and other difficulties arrested the Sovereign shaft
works after a few hundred feet of sinking had been done, and the
project was abandoned, as were a host of other ventures about the
same date along the White Horse and Canadian ranges. Meanwhile
less ambitious enterprise attacked the lines of lodes in the
ranges thereabouts, whence the Canadian, with its "Jewellers
Shops", and the Prince Regent and Sailors' Gully leads on the
east, and the Nightingale, Milkmaids, Malakoff, Redan, White
Horse, Frenchman's, and Cobblers leads on the west, had given to
the alluvial miners of the fifties and the sixties such splendid
harvests of gold. From 20 years since till now quartz mining has
been going on there, both small co-operative parties and public
incorporated companies engaging in the work, and fortunes have
been made by the luckier of the adventurers. Some of the largest
hauls of gold have been made by co-operative parties, whose
winnings have never been disclosed to the public, and it is now
known that a very large share of those successes have been along
the southern strike of the Indicator line.</p>
<p>Pearse's Lease is the name of a bundle of areas on the
northern side of the Canadian Gully, and several parties are
working on the leasehold, Pearse, the lessor, having a battery
there for his own and their service. As a rule, the results of
operations there are not publicly disclosed, but it is pretty
well-known that both the lessor and his sub-tenants have done
fairly well.</p>
<p>The North Woah Hawp claim adjoins Pearse's Lease on the south,
the map showing us that the rich Canadian gutter ran between the
two areas. This claim, no doubt, owes its dividend-paying power
to the gold on the Indicator line, which traverses the ground.
The company's stock is in 22,000 shares of 5s. Mr. J. M'Whae is
the manager, and the directors are Messrs. J.H. Williams
(chairman), W. Irwin, R.T. Blackwell, T. Bailey, H.G. Williams,
J. Johnson, and J. Bellinden.</p>
<p>The Prince Regent Company is one of the lucky ones, for, like
the North Woah Hawp, it has come upon some brilliant specimens of
rich stone lately on the strike of the Indicator.</p>
<p>Hundreds of ounces of bright gold in small portions of
dazzling white stone have been exhibited at the Corner by those
two companies lately. The Prince Regent stock is in 20,000 shares
of 10s. each, the manager is Mr. C. Barker, and the directors are
Messrs. T. Lyons (chairman), J.M. Davie, J. Lawrie, R. Don, and
Jas. Curtis.</p>
<p>The southern extension line stretches out with a host of
claims, but with only two or three that have any great hold yet
on public notice. Midway between the Prince Regent and the Desoza
and Buninyong Estate is the Rothschild. A mine near there earlier
had that historic name, but did not justify its title. With the
favoring gales of the revival, more advancement towards fortune
may be made by the new one. Mr. A.J.E. Morey is the manager, and
the directors are Messrs. R.M. Serjeant (chairman), B.J. Fink, E.
Morey, P. Matthews, and J.F. Levien. Capital £24,000, in 24,000
shares.</p>
<p>The Desoza is now less famous than it was a few years ago,
when its principal proprietor, after whom the mine and one of the
lodes in it are named, signalised some rare golden results by
taking a trip to Europe, bearing with him a large circlet made of
gold from the mine, and destined to be a grateful votive offering
to a venerated friend in the old world. There were preliminary
rites of picturesque celebration at the mine, where Desoza's
generosity and philanthropy worked other marvels of some note at
the time. Unhappily the Desoza lode did not preserve its fame for
richness, and the mine has been for a time in shadow.</p>
<p>The Buninyong Estate Company has the Desoza lode, as well as
others, including one called the Estate, and some excellent
results have been obtained there, although the returns for some
time past have not been satisfactory. Deeper levels are, however,
being reached and worked, and it is not unreasonable to hope that
before long the mine will be again very profitably worked. Rich
alluvial deposits were found in the vicinity, and the lodes which
fed them have their remainders there, as have in Ballarat those
which made the leads of this held so celebrated all the world
over. The Estate stock is in 20,000 £1 shares. Mr. J.A. Chalk is
the manager, and the directors are Messrs. P. Hedrick (chairman),
A. M'Donald, D. M'Phail, D. Brophy, and J. Whelan.</p>
<p>Away in the north-east corner of Mr. Allan's picture are the
Temperance and Monte Christo claims. We have mentioned some
qualities in the Temperance lode, and may add here that the brave
old company which worked it for so many years were only deterred
by the want of adequate capital from pursuing the work below the
deeper water levels. Now, however, fresh adventure there is
mooted, and the name of E. Morey on areas on either side is a
significant hint that capital is not far off, and will, in all
probability, be soon brought to bear in the renewal of larger
operations upon one of the most perfect lodes in the colony. The
Monte Christo lodes have in times past yielded well, and the
present operations are a resumption of work by men who know the
ground as a spot of fair promise.</p>
<p>It is time now to look at the western belt of lodes. That belt
traverses an auriferous alluvial tract hardly less notable than
that in the eastern basin. The history of the Koh-i-noor, Band
and Albion Consols, Prince of Wales, and other companies supplies
proof of the alluvial wealth of the past, and the lodes which
strike through the territory have since become prolific sources
of profit to a few companies. That the same field is likely to be
equally profitable to other companies cannot be reasonably
doubted, and that this is the general belief is shown in the
large number of new ventures already organised on the plateau
extending southward from Lake Wendouree. The immense amount of
gold taken out of the alluvial washes of the plateau supplies the
same argument as to the lodes there as was deducible from the
relation of the lodes of the eastern belt to the richness of the
alluvial gutters on that side, and the validity of the logic has
been demonstrated by actual results on both sides. We are now, in
fact, seeing a mining revival which is the direct product of the
proof of the argument that the remainders of the lodes which fed
the gutters and reef-washes will pay for working. As has been
said, the lodes of the plateau have been worked here and there
for many years past, but it was not till the continuing success
of the Band and Albion Consols Company at low levels and, more
notably still, the discoveries made by the Star of the East
Company had struck the general attention of the public that the
actual possibilities of quartz raining on the western belt of
lodes were practically realised. The Band and Albion lode and the
Guiding Star or Star of the East lode are but two of the western
belt, but they are the richer so far as discovery has yet gone,
and they are eastward&mdash;that is, on the source side of the
main body of the alluvial deposits of the plateau&mdash;so that
the inference is natural that the great richness of those
deposits was mainly due to the lodes in question. Nearly six
millions sterling worth of gold was obtained from the alluvial
fed in part by the detritus from the lodes in question, and now
the actual explorations of those lodes hundreds of feet beneath
the site of the alluvial bear out the assumption that the
continuations of the original matrices of the gold are also rich
in the precious metal. The successes of the two leading companies
already mentioned have made the drainage of the plateau a more
pressing public question, and have led to the taking up the whole
available country along the belt. British capital is being sought
as a help to development, but, as Mr. William Luplau, in his
pamphlet, "The Sebastopol Plateau", reminds us, we have ourselves
given evidence of our faith in the legitimacy of the field by
organisations actually extant to the tune of a million of capital
sterling. Certainly, nowhere else should there be greater faith
in the future of local quartz mining than here, where the
prodigious alluvial products of the lodes have been raised, and
hence the local undertakings to explore the remainders of the
lodes themselves.</p>
<p>Mr. Luplau gives the following table in his pamphlet, but it

existing:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is not necessary that we should deal with these tabled
mines in detail, and the two leading ones have been mentioned
already in our chapter on mining. The present Band and Albion
Consols directors are Messrs. D. Brophy (chairman), J.H.
Williams, W.H. Sewell, W. Canning, and J. Whelan. The Star of the
East manager is Mr. E.W. Spain, and the office is in Melbourne.
The directors are Messrs. G.J. Carroll (chairman), Alex. Gilpin,
R.T. Vale, J. Spence, and J.H. Miller.</p>
<p>The New Koh-i-Noor manager is Mr. J.H. Dill, and the directors
are Messrs. J. Embling (chairman), C. Seal, E. Morey, Alex.
Gilpin, J. Hicks, G.J. Carroll, and A. Wynne. This is a quartz
company, whose mine includes a large portion of the ground held
by the alluvial company whose name is revived in the present
company, and whose successes are noted in the mining chapter. The
new company holds a very large area, and it is traversed by
several lodes, but no large successes have yet been achieved.</p>
<p>Some dead and some small live ventures are pictured on the map
between the Koh-i-Noor and Band and Albion claims, whilst to the
west and north are new projects yet to be tested. The Band and
Barton mine is one of the smaller areas from which good gold has
been taken, and whose resources are not yet fully opened up. Mr.
J.A. Chalk is the manager, and the directors are Messrs. M.
Butterly (chairman), R. Tolhurst, W.E. Watts, D. Brophy, F.
Hamilton, W. Murrell, G.G. Morton, and M. Griffiths, the stock
being in 24,667 £1 shares. Mr. Barton, the mine manager, who has
given his name to the mine as well as much shrewd practical
energy, laid before the public some little time ago a scheme for
raising gigantic sums for prospecting and drainage purposes, but
his financial proposals have not received general support, and so
have fallen fruitless for the present. Of the other companies,
one, the Don Company, has its site adjacent to the wonderfully
rich reef-washes worked by the dead Sir William Don Alluvial
Company, whose heavy gold was, no doubt, the product of the
denuded lodes whose remainders exist in the yet untested depths
below. Gay's Freehold Company has a capital of £24,000, in 24,000
shares.</p>
<p>The manager is Mr. E.W. Spain, and the directors are Messrs.
G.J. Carroll (chairman), Alex. Gilpin, R.T. Vale, A. Ramsay, and
D. Thompson. Mr. Spain is also the manager of the Carroll
Company, whose capital is £52,000, in 26,000 shares. The
directors are Messrs. G.J. Carroll (chairman), J.B. Dean, Alex.
Gilpin, R.T. Vale, and W. Hicks. The North Plateau Company is
managed by Mr. C. Wilson, and the directors are Messrs. R.
Tolhurst (chairman), the Hon. H. Gore, M.L.C., W. Murrell, W.
Luplau, Alex. Gilpin, H. Parkin, and G.J. Carroll. The South
Plateau Company's manager is Mr. J.P. Roberts, and the directors
are Messrs. Alex. Gilpin (chairman), T. Stoddart, W. Luplau, G.
King, and W. Irwin. The Northern Star Company's manager is Mr. C.
Barker, and the directors are Messrs. Alex. Gilpin (chairman), E.
Morey, the Hon. D. Ham, M.L.C., G.J. Carroll, and J. Robb. The
South Star Company's manager is Mr. E.W. Stephens, and the
directors are Messrs. R.T. Vale (chairman), Alex. Gilpin, G.J.
Carroll, J. Mager, and T. Stoddart. The Sebastopol Star Company
has a capital of £6000, in 24,000 shares. Mr. J.P. Roberts is the
manager, and the directors are Messrs. J. Wall (chairman), Alex.
Gilpin, L.S. Blair, W. Irwin, and W. Murrell. The Don Company is
in the managerial care of Mr. C. Barker, and the capital and the
directory are the same as in the Southern Star Company. The
capital of companies mentioned in Mr. Luplau's table is not
repeated here.</p>
<p>The Sir Henry Loch Company, next north from the Band and
Albion Consols, has a capital of £24,000, in 24,000 shares, is
just getting its first gold, and has fair promise of success. Mr.
W.M. Acheson is the manager, and the directors are Messrs. J.
Coghlan (chairman), Alex. M'Vitty, J.J. Göller, J. Donaghy, and
W.G. Williams.</p>
<p>The Sebastopol Plateau manager is Mr. J.A. Chalk, and the
directors are Messrs. W.H. Barnard (chairman), Alex. Gilpin, R.
Wrigley, W. Luplau, D. Fern, J. Curtis, and E. Jeffrey.</p>
<p>The Central Plateau manager is Mr. W.M. Acheson, and the
directors are Messrs. E.O. Witherden (chairman), Alex. Gilpin, T.
Stoddart, J. Cotter, and H. Goddard.</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales and Bonshaw Company has an enormous
territory, comprising the areas once held by the alluvial
companies of those names, and one or more of the champion lodes
of the plateau strike through the claim, besides several others
yet to be proved. The manager is Mr. J.A. Chalk, and the
directors are Messrs. W. Bailey (chairman), E. Morey, O.E.
Edwards, M. Griffiths, and P. Matthews.</p>
<p>The Owen's and Band of Hope Freehold and Leasehold manager is
Mr. E.W. Spain, and the directors are Messrs. G.J. Carroll, Alex.
Gilpin, R.T. Vale, J.B. Dean, and J. Jenkins.</p>
<p>The Leviathan Syndicate is in Mr. J.A. Chalk's managerial
hands, and the territory, as the map indicates, is the largest of
the whole series of mines mapped. The ground includes the once
famous alluvial mines held by the Leviathan, Great Gulf, and
other companies, which won large amounts of gold. As yet the new
venture is waiting registration, and it is probable that its vast
possibilities, both for alluvial and quartz exploration of a
profitable character, will be undertaken by a mixed English and
Australian proprietary. The provisional directors are Messrs. the
Hon. H. Gore, M.L.C., Hon. D. Ham, M.L.C., T. Dibdin, Alex.
Gilpin, S. Solomon, and P. O'Connor.</p>
<p>The wide field and large promise existing here for the
exercise of either home or foreign capital are tolerably evident
facts to anyone who takes the trouble to study the history of
local mining development during the last 30 years, and to compare
its outcome with the actual prospects of to-day and the
indefinite future. The great amount of gold taken out of the
gutters and reef-washes has not exhausted the resources of the
field even in alluvial deposits, although it is next to certain
that the best portions of them have been discovered and lifted.
But it is generally admitted by practical miners here that in the
Sebastopol plateau there still exist reaches of alluvial wash, in
high and dry levels as well as in lower levels, that will pay for
lifting, and this has always been one urgent ground on which the
more perfect drainage of the area has been demanded. The alluvial
remains, however, are now to be regarded as only accessory to the
more important quartz resources now just opening up on the
plateau, though it is held by some experienced miners that the
abandoned Winter's Freehold ground will pay handsomely in its yet
unexplored alluvial reaches, if once a shaft were sunk in a
situation where the wash could be brought to grass with
reasonable economy. It has always been the belief of experts that
one cause of the Winter's Freehold failure was the enormous
distance which the wash had to be conveyed from the faces to the
shaft, and hence the conclusion as to the probability that a
shaft sunk further out would give success instead of failure. If,
however, this project needed additional incentive, it may be
found in the fact that, as Mr. Allan's map indicates, prodigious
masses of quartz exist within the area. One line of reef
discovered in the course of the alluvial workings is marked on
the map as having a thickness of 60 feet, and it is not likely
that that is the only lode existing there. Stretching across,
then, from that present western outpost of quartz discovery to
the eastern lodes working in the Monte Christo mines, we have, in
this mapped area alone, four or five miles of country literally
striped with quartz lodes and innumerable interlacing veins, and
traversed by alluvial gutters whose realised wealth is a part of
the world's history. The great facts of the ascertained past
warrant the recognition of the probabilities of the future, which
point to the promise of golden wealth in the lodes remaining
equal to, or greater than, all that which existed in the gutters
and gutter banks where the alluvial miners of the last three
decades discovered such vast deposits of the precious metal. This
fact is so important that we may be pardoned for reiteration in
the matter. And we may also be permitted to point to the
reasonable further conclusion that, rich as were those alluvial
deposits, it is fair to assume that our miners had not before
them all the detritus of the abraded and vanished portions of the
ancient matrices. Some, we know not how much, of the gold has,
unquestionably, been swept away in the hurly burly of the
elements during the periods of denudation. But in the remaining
lodes, still, as before, the only known prolific matrices of
gold, we possess all the gold that remains in them, possess it,
that is, potentially, if we have capital enough and energy enough
for its discovery.</p>
<p>And this consideration brings us to consider the debt which
the district owes to the spirit of enterprise shown by the more
or less wealthy promoters of mining development. It is not our
business here to discuss the motives, or the methods, or the
mysteries of mining promotion, but simply to point to the fact
that the district owes much of its prosperity to the pluck, the
calculating intelligence, and the large risks of capital by a
comparatively small number of men, men who, for the most part,
have risen from the ranks of practical mining industry. There is
a sense, of course, in which every shareholder is a promoter of
mining enterprise, but it is the relatively few who take the
initiative in large speculations, and are the more conspicuous as
the founders of new adventures, the prosecution of which means
the opening up of large new fields of mining. The directors of
companies, and not a few of the legal and mining managers, are
generally men of note as sagacious projectors or wise
counsellors, and a host of such names is given in these pages;
but nothing less than a list of the members of the Stock
Exchange, and of the shareholders in the several companies on the
Exchange list, would be at all exhaustive of the tale of men who
have given or are giving valuable assistance in the local
development of our auriferous resources. Still, there are always
certain names which occur to every local resident when mining
undertakings, and especially new ventures of magnitude, are
discussed. The Baileys, the Barnards, the Brophys, the Carrolls,
the Cornwells, the Emblings, the Edwardses, the Forshaws, the
Gores, the Gilpins, the Hams, the Hardys, the Joneses, the
Loughlins, the Leishmans, the Moreys, the Magers, the Millards,
the Randalls, the Robbs, the Stoddarts, the Seals, the Smiths,
the Vales, the Witherdens, the Williamsons, the Wynnes, are as
household words in regard to mining adventure, but they are only
samples after all, picked for their special prominence, samples
of a larger bulk of energetic enterprise. The interest such
leading men hold, and the risks run by them in the conduct of the
various undertakings for the opening up of new mines, or the
carrying on of mines already in operation, are very large. A
striking example of this, and of what one plucky man can do, is
before the author now in a communication he has received in the
course of the preparation of these pages. This correspondent
says, in reference to the current stir in mining:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I may say of my own knowledge that when Mr. A. Gilpin
bought into the Sulieman Pasha and owned, I believe, more than a
fourth of the company, mining public attention was practically
directed to not only this mine, but many others in the east. I
also consider that the system he advocated&mdash;coming here with
a practical and successful Sandhurst reefing experience&mdash;has
helped largely to the present mining revival in Ballarat, as it
was, to a very great extent, his capital and experience that
helped the Star of the East Company to surmount its difficulties,
and on the success of that mine many others were floated, with
every prospect of achieving the same success. I think most of the
practical mining men here will bear me out in these remarks. I do
not know how many companies he is interested in, but I should
think in at least 30 or 40, and that he is one of the largest
shareholders in Ballarat.</blockquote>
<p>Without adopting this correspondent's views absolutely, the
author is bound to say that in the main the above quotation is
correct. The promoters of mining make it largely or entirely
their business, and to natural shrewdness add long, varied, and
expert acquaintance with the practice and theory of mining. They
thus possess a special value as advisers, and as they are
generally ready to back their own opinions with their own money,
their lead is followed, as a rule, by the general body of
speculators. Their influence and guidance are always in request
for directoral boards, and thus it comes about, as these pages
show, that the same names occur over and over again in the list
of managing boards.</p>
<p>We have taken a look at the quartz belts on both sides of the
Yarrowee, and have given some details of the ventures there, but
the same adventurers who have helped to produce the success which
has led to the revival of mining in Ballarat proper, have not
confined their attention to local mines. In the adjoining
districts of Maryborough and Ararat there are mines whose
starting and working were either entirely or very largely of
Ballarat origin. Many of them have their seat of management here,
and others, like them, are largely held by Ballarat investors.
The Chalks, the Kong Mengs, the Napiers, the Dukes, the Shaws are
names of as many series of mines in Majorca, Carisbrook,
Maryborough, and other places in that direction, from some of
which gold and dividends are being drawn, and for the working of
others large monthly sums in calls go out from this centre. Those
stocks, whether good or bad time alone can determine, enter
largely into the daily business of the Ballarat Stock Exchange,
and make liberal drafts upon local capital. The Beaufort mines on
the Ballarat side of the Ararat district are of less importance
at present, and only one or two are now in the hands of Ballarat
directors and managers.</p>
<p>The alluvial fields of the Ballarat district are now mainly
restricted to the Creswick division, and one of the accompanying
sensations of the revival has been the discovery of large nuggets
in the Midas mine on the western side of the Divide. As has been
indicated in the body of this book, the prosecution of mining on
that side has been largely due to the energy and enterprise of
Miss Cornwell, whose father, Mr. George Corn well, was chairman
of the original Dowling Forest Estate Company in the Midas
locality. To that lady is also due in part the creation of
syndicates for mining the Speedwell and other grounds in Ballarat
East, the Speedwell mine yielding from 80oz. to 100oz. per
fortnight to the new owners. The Midas mine, however, is the
chief source alike of fame and profit to the Cornwell promoters
and their allies. Geological prophecies and bore indications tell
of a large area of probably profitable alluvium in the Sulky
Gully and Dowling Forest country, and a large number of shafts
and bores are at work there, but up to date the Midas is the only
mine that is a demonstrated success. The directors, in their
report to the July meeting of the company, say "the Midas mine
has renewed the exciting era of nuggets," but they little knew
that in a week or two thereafter a nugget was to be unearthed
that would fairly arouse the public attention of the colony as in
the glorious days of the big lumps of gold tabled in Chapter VII.
of this work. When Lord and Lady Brassey were here, they visited
the mine on the 10th June, and on the 11th a nugget weighing
167oz. was discovered on the gutter banks, and it was named the
"Lady Brassey", in honor of that lady. In July smaller lumps
weighing 39oz., 32oz., and 28oz., besides many still smaller
ones, were discovered, and on the 23rd August the largest nugget
found since the year 1869 was brought to light. This was a lump
of pure gold weighing 617oz., and it was found at a spot about 50
feet distant from the place where the "Lady Brassey" was
discovered. When it was brought into Ballarat next day by Manager
Robert Bryant and his men, and exhibited in Stoddart and Binnie's
window at the Corner, the excitement was a moving reminder of the
"good old days". Hundreds of sight-seers flocked to the Corner,
and thus the ordinary hundreds of stock dealers were swollen for
the time by the rush of as many hundreds more. Next day the
nugget was sent to Melbourne, was exhibited at Government House,
and there it was named the "Lady Loch", in honor of His
Excellency's wife. Miss Cornwell had sailed some days before for
London on a financial mission there, and it is understood at the
"Lady Loch" nugget will be forwarded intact to London to serve as
an illustration of the value of the mining grounds of the
Ballarat goldfield. The Midas claim is an area of close on 1000
acres; the company has never made a call, has won over 7300oz. of
gold, and has two shafts and two well-appointed steam plants, on
which £9670 has been spent up to date.</p>
<p>It will be easily imagined that the splendid fortunes of the
Midas Company have given heart to the swarm of ventures around,
as the Dowling Forest No. 1, Midas Consols, Midas Extended, Midas
East, Midas North, Midas South, Midas King, Midas No. 1, Midas
Revival, Midas Mount Cavern, and Madame Midas, and if but half of
the mines turn out to be profitable, a great new alluvial field
will be added to the wealth of the district and of the colony. On
the Creswick side of the Divide the mines of Kingston and Smeaton
and their vicinities occupy a high place in public estimation,
and at the time of this writing the market is enlivened by the
news of heavy gold from the famous Madame Berry mine's No. 2
shaft, where the first washings have just taken place.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to state that all the mines shown on
Mr. Allan's map are not actually now producing gold. Some are
only in the initial stage of operations, and, whether on old
ground or new, their future is all unknown. In a sense, as much
may be said, of course, of all mines, even gold-producing ones,
so great is the uncertainty of mining. But, after all, that is
only a relative term. Actual discoveries, and the probabilities
based on the known, do make future successes in many cases
reasonably certain, although their actual measure is not
ascertainable before hand. Of the mines on the eastern belt of
lodes, the Monte Christo, Temperance, most of the Black Hill
series, Sulieman Pasha, Britannia United, Last Chance,
Llanberris, Speedwell, North Woah Hawp, Woah Hawp Canton, Woah
Hawp Hong Kong, Prince Regent, Pearse's, and several unnamed
co-operative ventures have reached gold. Of the public companies
on that belt, the Sulieman Pasha, Llanberris, and North Woah Hawp
are paying dividends, and others are approaching, through what
miners call dead work, to that happy condition. Large dividends
have been secured by co-operative parties, but they do not
disclose actual results. On the western belt of lodes, the Band
and Albion Consols, Star of the East, Band and Barton,
Koh-i-noor, Serjeant's, Band of Hope, and Sir Henry Loch have
been or are producing mines, and the first two are large
producers and pay dividends. All of them, indeed, save the Loch,
have paid dividends, and all may fairly be expected to do so
again. All mines have their barren stages of dead work, as well
after as before reaching gold, and the more or less near future
will probably see at least a score of dividend-paying mines added
to the present list of fortunate ventures.</p>
<p>The current mining revival is not local merely. There is a
"boom" over the whole colony, and in all kinds of stock, the
aggregate appreciation in which has been estimated by a writer in
the Melbourne <i>Argus</i> at some ten millions sterling,
including stocks in the silver mines of South Australia. As has
been remarked, this greater interest in mining matters is largely
due to the reduction of bank interest on deposits from six to
four per cent. for yearly, and to three and two per cent. for
half-yearly and quarterly terms, thus throwing heavy sums upon
the stock and share market for investment. Imported capital, in
the shape of public loans and private investments, has also
swelled the amount of available money, and its relative cheapness
gives new vigor to all kinds of share market business. There are
over a hundred members in the Ballarat Stock Exchange, and the
press of business there lately has given them two sittings daily
of over an hour's duration each for the most part, whereas in
times of duller enterprise half that time has served for the
transaction of business. Some surprise was caused a few days ago
by an announcement in a Melbourne paper that Mr. Thomas Stoddart,
of the Ballarat Exchange, had paid £800 for a seat in the
Melbourne Exchange, but enquiry proved that the statement was
true, and that the purchase was probably a highly beneficial one
for the purchaser. Mr. Stoddart's theory is, that the Melbourne
Exchange is to be the great exchange of the Australian colonies,
and that it may some day, not far off, rival the San Francisco
Exchange, where he saw a seat sold for 40,000 dollars. He paid
£600 to Mr. Melhado for the Melbourne seat, and £200 as an
entrance fee, but since then the Melbourne Exchange has decided
to limit its roll to 100 members, and to charge £1000 each for
the 25 new seats to make up the hundred, the capital thus
accumulating to be used in the erection of a new exchange
building worthy of the times and the metropolis. This is
mentioned as an illustration of the magnitude of the sharebroking
and share-dealing interests, and because they are indications of
the large amount of attention and capital devoted to the
exploration of our gold mines. The Ballarat Exchange bears a
prominent part in the general sum of mining business, and though,
as we write, the local "boom" is not so high in its swing as it
was a week or two ago, the impetus given by it to local
enterprise is bound to be productive of good, in the greater life
imparted to an industry with whose fortunes the prosperity of
this city and district must, for generations to come, be
intimately connected.</p>

<br>
<strong>To French People Living</strong><br>
<br>
IN THE COLONY OF VICTORIA.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>In the midst of the disturbances which are stirring
the Ballaraat Mines, the Consul of France believes he must
recommend his compatriots abstain from every demonstration which
would have as its purpose the repudiation of <i>the authority of
the Queen's representatives in the</i> Colony of
Victoria.</strong></p>
<p>They are obliged not to forget that they are in a country
(which is) a friend of France, and that the first duty of a
foreigner is to respect the authority of the country giving him
hospitality.</p>
<p>If French people have complaints or grievances to forward to
the Colonial Government, they can send them in complete
confidence to France's Consul, who will know how to deliver them
justice.</p>
